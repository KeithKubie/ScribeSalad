00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.510
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:18.080
[ Silence ]

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.380
John Cole:

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.220
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon and welcome
to the Library of Congress.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.130
I'm John Cole, I'm the Director
for the Center for the Book

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.710
which is the reading and literacy
promotion arm of the library

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.270
and we promote books
in reading and literacy

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.880
in every way we can think of.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.370
And we work around the
country actually with a system

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.170
of states Centers for the Book
and every state that does work,

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.350
promotion work in the states often

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.430
through literacy festivals
and book festivals.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.530
We also have reading
promotion partners.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.110
We also play here at the library,

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.580
a major role in the National
Book Festival which I hope most

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.970
of you know and participate in.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.360
And the Books and Beyond series

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.230
which you are attending today
is our series of noon time talks

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:16.140
about writers who have new
books that relate in some way

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.440
to the Library of Congress
and does this one every relate

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.770
to the Library of Congress.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.850
There's lots of different ways.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:30.200
And we're going to enjoy not
only quite a tale but also,

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.880
really kind of a revelation
of coincidences

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.460
that are speaker will talk about
relating to the name Urschel.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.710
And that's one that I'm going
to leave our speaker to get into

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.150
but I want to tell you a little
bit about what will happen.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.740
Our, Joe will speak for 30 to 40
minutes with his presentation.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.250
We'll have time for
questions and answers

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.740
and then we will have
a book signing.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.310 position:56%
All of these programs are filmed
for the Library of Congress website.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.190
So I will ask you to turn
off all things electronic

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.250
and we will proceed
with the program.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.250
Joe Urschel is the
Executive Director of NOW,

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.770
currently of the National
Law Enforcement Museum

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.900
which will be built
in, which will be built

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.930
in Washington D.C. I
knew Joe, I first met him

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.900
when he was executive
director of the museum.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.890
And I read a little bit
about him last night

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.750
and he merely was really one
of the founders of the museum.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.580
And now has moved on in this area.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.460
He's the former managing editor
of USA Today where he also served

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.620 position:56%
as a senior correspondent columnist.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.890
He has worked for the
Detroit Free Press

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.360
as a reporter, critic and editor.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.030
And he has loads and loads
of journalism honors.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:58.160
Not only do I want you to make
sure you turn off your electronic

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.500
devices, but I want to tell
you a couple of other things.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.400
We do have on the table when
you go out to the signing area,

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.820
a couple of the Center
for the book publications

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:15.460
which includes the latest issue of
the Library of Congress magazine,

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.400
LQM which on of all
things, the Joy of Reading.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.370
And we worked hard with the
communications office to get this

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.450
out in time for the last
book festival and we made it.

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.810
And it's still right now
is the most current issue.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.510
So I want you to pick
up a copy if you can.

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.490
You'll learn about what the
library does throughout the library

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.860
to promote books and reading.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.630
Secondly, the Center for the
Book has just produced as part

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:48.510
of the Literacy Awards
program, our best practices

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.310
that really describe the
award winners for this year.

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.090
And this excellent publication
does describe the organizations.

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:00.420
We gave three.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.550
This program is supported by David
Rubenstein and it's the third year

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.000
of the five year grant program.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.700
And we give cash awards and
also best practice awards.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.460 position:56%
And this year we recognize 17
organizations from around the world.

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:19.670
So I almost forgot to tell
you about that, but I want you

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:25.820
to have a chance to pick that
up before Mr. Urschel starts.

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.690
But he's agreed to let
me start in one way.

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.440
I mentioned that most of the
Books and Beyonds connection

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.980 position:56%
with the Library of Congress, a lot
of them are based on the collections

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.680
of the library where
the research was done.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.780
Others are established because
of a project that the Library

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.530
of Congress has developed
or a publication.

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.760
And we sponsor these programs for
really, many of the new Library

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.070
of Congress publications.

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.140
We are also, there's a
special family connection here

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.610
in this instance.

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.590
Donna Urschel who does
such a wonderful job

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.390
in our communications
office is Joe's wife.

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:12.680
But also there's a story I'm going
to read about how he first thought

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:17.750
up this book and this is another
Library of Congress connection.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.040
And this is reading from the
author's note just a little bit.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.340
This is Joe speaking.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.770
In 1982, shortly after I
moved to Washington D.C.,

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.460
I went to visit the Library of
Congress' Jefferson building.

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.660
It doesn't mention
Donna being along but,

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.940
one of the city's most gorgeous
landmarks which contains,

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:41.120
as it said, the greatest collection
of knowledge in the world.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:46.580
Amen. The Library of Congress had
just recently converted its fame

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:52.350
collection cataloging system
in semicolon, semi-parenthesis.

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:55.490
The one J. Edgar Hoover,
a character in this,

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.600 position:56%
had learned during his brief
[inaudible] there as a clerk earlier

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.610
in his career, in parenthesis,
then converted

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.610
into a searchable computerized
database,

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.980
something that was quite novel
and innovative at the time.

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:12.470
Out of curiosity, I went to the
keyboard and typed in my last name.

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:16.410
A simple Google search today
would now reveal hundreds of hits,

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:20.040
but back then in the early
days of the digital revolution,

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:23.740
the LOC's computer index
turned up only one,

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.290
Charles Urschel, kidnapping victim.

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:30.700
And there was one book in
which he was noted prominently.

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:35.890 position:56%
It was E.E. Kirkpatrick's
firsthand account, Crime's Paradise.

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:37.580
The authentic inside story

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:41.170
of the Urschel kidnapping,
published in 1934.

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:43.570
I immediately requested the book.

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.800
And when the librarian
pulled it from the stacks,

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:51.670
I sat in LOCs stately reading
room and read it cover to cover.

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:55.510
Let me introduce Joe Urschel
to continue the story, Joe.

00:06:55.510 --> 00:07:04.190
[ Applause &amp; Silence ]

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:05.490
Joe Urschel:

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:07.100
&gt;&gt; So imagine my surprise
when this name pops up

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:11.180 position:56%
and I know nothing about the fellow.

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:15.210
I thought I knew that
all of the Urschels

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:21.660
in the country were related,
I of course was wrong.

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:26.840
But I was just transfixed by the
idea that I didn't know anything

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:32.400
about this guy who shared my
last name and was so instrumental

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:38.100 position:56%
in this landmark crime and landmark
crime investigation and prosecution.

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:43.600
I knew a lot about J. Edgar Hoover,
one of the other main characters.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.360
I thought I knew a lot
about Machine Gun Kelly,

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:51.150
the leader of the criminal gang
that perpetrates the kidnapping.

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:57.330
But the central character of the
story, the true hero was kind

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:01.030
of lost to history and
that was Charles Urschel.

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:05.260 position:56%
So I called up my Dad and I said you
know, are we related to this guy,

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.090
we've got to be related to him.

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:08.810
And he said, no we're not.

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:10.510
I said, how do you know?

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:12.950
He said, we're just not, I know.

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:17.690
So like any good son I immediately
set out to prove my Dad wrong

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:22.930
and began a little genealogical
research and kept digging

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:26.260
into the origins of the name
and the origins of the family.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.210
And darn, it turned
out we weren't related,

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:34.260
at least not in this country and
not dating back a century or more

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:39.240
into Germany or what is
now the German Republic.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:44.170
So with that I began
collecting string on this story.

00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:48.990
I of course was still transfixed
by the idea of this story

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:53.760
and Kirkpatrick's book which
was written, Kirkpatrick,

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.770
it turned out is a player
in this, in the story.

00:08:56.770 --> 00:09:01.000
He worked for Charles Urschel
and while Charles was kidnapped,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.820
he had served as the man
who delivered the ransom.

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:07.100
His book was written
but one year afterward

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:09.140
and it didn't get a lot of play.

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:14.710
And it was kind of
subsequently ignored by scholars

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:17.260
who were researching the story.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:21.410
But it's one of the most
remarkable kidnappings in history.

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:25.400
It produced the largest
manhunt in the history

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:28.530
of American law enforcement
at the time.

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:30.680
The FBI or the Bureau
of Investigation

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:34.510
which had just been
authorized to cross state lines

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:38.540
to catch kidnappers, they were the
only law enforcement agency allowed

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:40.040
to do that.

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:45.420
Crossed 16 state lines and covered
20,000 miles in their effort to run

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:50.250
down Machine Gun Kelly and
his glamourous wife Kathryn.

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:54.440
It resulted in a sensational trial
that was covered daily in the press

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:57.720
by reporters from, not just
reporters from around the country

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.550
but around the world as well.

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:05.320
The Europeans were just fascinated
by the criminality of Americans

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:09.980
and heavily reported on the
things that were going here.

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:12.020
The case really launched the FBI.

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:16.010
The FBI would one year later become
the FBI after being just the Bureau

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:18.730
of Investigation of the
Department of Justice.

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:23.210
And it gave the FBI agents
their nickname of G Men.

00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:28.780
It resulted in the establishment
of Alcatraz as a federal prison,

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:32.700
basically a penal colony for
the, what they call the vicious

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:36.520
and irredeemable types,
the worst of the worst.

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:41.520
And it sped the passage of
the Federal Crime Bill of 1934

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:45.820
which established a number
of new federal crimes

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:49.290
that the FBI would then
be allowed to prosecute

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:54.740
and greatly expanded the,
their powers and made the crime

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:58.290
of kidnapping punishable by death.

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:03.400 position:56%
And all of this was made possible by
the cooperation of Charles Urschel,

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:06.700
the man forgotten to history.

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:09.750 position:56%
The story takes place in 1933 which,

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:14.380
as the title claims
is the year of fear.

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:17.560
It is one of the worst
years, if not the worst years

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:21.240
in American history
since the Civil War.

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:24.810
You have a number of, you
have a confluence of a number

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:29.030 position:56%
of disastrous elements taking place.

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:30.910
It is the worst year
of the depression,

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:34.110
the depression has lingered
on for about 3 1/2 years

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:35.930
when this is taken place.

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:39.220
And consequently you have
unemployment rates in some cities

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:42.650
that stretch as high as 84%.

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:46.730
Farms are devastated, homes
are being repossessed.

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:49.610
And at the same time
that that's going on,

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:51.270
the Dust Bowl is beginning.

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:58.300
And the Dust Bowl was just a
cataclysmic environmental disaster.

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:04.080
It would pick up dirt in Oklahoma
City where this crime takes place

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:08.630
and blow it all the way into
Newfoundland and out to sea.

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:14.190
It was, the dust was so thick that
it would choke cattle in the fields

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:17.200
and it would blind ships
coming into New York Harbor

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.690
and turn the snow red in Maine.

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:27.130
And with all of that going on,
you've got, these are a couple

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:30.820
of pictures from the library's
collection of the effects

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:35.120
of the Dust Bowl, with
all that going

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.650
on you've got this incredible sense

00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:40.690
of lawlessness that's
spreading through the country.

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:45.730
Basically, big cities out east are
being run and controlled by large

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:48.090
and organized crime gangs.

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:52.060
You know, notoriously
Al Capone is Chicago.

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:55.980 position:56%
But out West along what was
referred to as the criminal corridor

00:12:55.980 --> 00:13:00.320
which stretched from Dallas,
Texas to St. Paul, Minnesota,

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:07.360
you had basically the extensions of
the outlaw gangs of the Wild West.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:11.640
And these were kind of independent
contractors who would pick up

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:17.750
and form gangs to rob banks or run
liquor or to serve as assassins

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:21.860
for the organized criminals
in the eastern cities

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:27.630
and they were basically
running unimpeded in that area,

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:34.660
because of the cooperation of local
police and the ineffectiveness,

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:38.810
the ineffectiveness and the
lack of a national police force.

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:43.180
There really was no force at the
time that was allowed to cross it,

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:47.120 position:56%
the county sheriffs shouldn't
really cross county lines in pursuit

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:50.670
and they didn't cross state lines.

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:55.610
And at the time they were only
11 state police forces anyway.

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:59.570
So these guys like Kelly

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:03.110
and his gang would operate
with virtual impunity.

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:05.520
And in a lot of cases
they had the support

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:07.660
of the local population as well.

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:11.650
If you're a farmer and you've
been foreclosed on by the bank,

00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:15.150
you don't shed a lot of tears
when somebody robs that bank.

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:18.690
And of course, these
gangsters were pretty good

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:20.850
at self-promotion as well.

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:24.780
A number of them would claim that
when they would rob the bank,

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:28.040 position:56%
they would tear up the mortgage
notes as well to protect the farmers

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:30.000
from being foreclosed upon.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.260
Doubtful whether they
actually ever did that

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.980
but anyway that's what
the story was.

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:37.650
And at the time that
all of this is going on,

00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:39.690
prohibition is about to end.

00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:50.100
Prohibition ends in 1933 with
the incoming FDR Administration.

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:55.550
And just about the time that FDR
announces that we have nothing

00:14:55.550 --> 00:15:00.040
to fear but fear itself, we have
this situation in the country

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:04.240
where lawlessness is
getting worse and worse.

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:07.130
This is the Union Station
in Kansas City,

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:09.330 position:56%
the site of the Kansas City Massacre

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:13.030
which occurred one month
before the Urschel kidnapping.

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:16.460
And this was thought to
be a, the tipping point

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:20.170
in peoples tolerance
for crime out West.

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:25.960
In this, in this instance Vernon
Miller and two other assassins,

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:33.580
while trying to rescue a captured
prisoner killed four lawmen

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:37.670
and the prisoner himself in
the shootout with machine guns

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:39.750
that lasted about 90
seconds in the middle

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:44.000
of this crowded parking
lot in Kansas City.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.910
And that really put the pressure
on J. Edgar Hoover and his men

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:53.980
to do something about
this criminality

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:56.510
that was sweeping the nation.

00:15:56.510 --> 00:15:58.890
Unfortunately, J. Edgar
Hoover at the time is

00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:01.170
in a very tenuous position.

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:07.130
He has just escaped a sacking
from the first attorney general

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:11.980
that FDR appoints, a
fellow named Thomas Walsh.

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:15.660
Walsh was a senator from
Montana who had a very long

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:18.670
and bad history with
J. Edgar Hoover.

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:21.280
During the Harding Administration,

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:26.480
Walsh and his associates
were investigating corruption

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:32.420 position:56%
and the attorney general at the time
instructed Hoover to dig up dirt

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:34.970
on the guys who were
running the investigation.

00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:39.420
So Hoover had tried to compromise
Walsh in any way he possibly could.

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:40.720
He opened his mail.

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:42.020
He tailed his family.

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:46.530
He tried to get a woman to
lure him into a hotel room

00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:50.010
where he could photographed,
all of this has failed.

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:53.970
However, Thomas Walsh made it
known that once he took office,

00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:56.620
he was going to clean house and
that would be the end J. Edgar

00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:58.240
Hoover's reign.

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:06.360
Unfortunately, before he could take
office, he was a 76 year old widow.

00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:12.020
He gets married in Miami to a Cuban
debutant, boards the train to come

00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:16.830
to Washington, but only makes
it as far as to North Carolina.

00:17:16.830 --> 00:17:22.990
And so with his death on the
train, Hoover escaped his sacking

00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:25.180
and the next attorney
general appointment,

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:30.510
a fellow named Homer Cummings sees
some potential in Hoover and says,

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:34.890
well we're going to hang on to you
but here's what you need to do.

00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:38.100
You need to show us something,
you need to, we need some kind

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:42.560
of marquee case that can prove
that we should be the agency

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:46.170
that should police the nation.

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:50.570
And so Hoover immediately sets
out to do any number of things

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:56.720
to launch his career, including
the capture of the prisoner

00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:00.560
who was killed Kansas
City's parking lot.

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:04.220
So at this point, he's desperately
looking around for something

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:05.950
that he could make his mark with.

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:10.030
He's failed for 18 months to
solve the Lindbergh kidnapping

00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:13.330
which is lingering on and he's
been under a lot of pressure

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:16.180
and been ridiculed for that.

00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:22.790
Nevertheless, he, he's always been
a guy who was interested in sort

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:29.160
of furthering the scientific
approach to law enforcement.

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:33.130
So what he does to combat
the scourge of kidnappings

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:36.080
that are taking place,
is setup a hotline.

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:41.660
It's about to be the first crime
hotline that was in the nation.

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:45.220
So on this hotline you can
call and immediately be put

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:48.860
through to the justice
department to report a kidnapping.

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:52.700 position:56%
Hoover thinking that this gives his
agents an edge, because they can get

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:54.820 position:56%
to the scene quickly and get control

00:18:54.820 --> 00:19:00.230
of the investigation before
the local cops take it over.

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:05.850 position:56%
Kidnapping at the time was
becoming rampant around the country,

00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:10.900
because of the coming advent
of prohibition and the banks,

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:15.820
banks failing in the depression,
there was very little money to rob

00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:19.780
in a bank even you could
successfully pull it off.

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:26.580
So that business was falling
out as well as the pending death

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:28.500
of the gin running businesses

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:32.480
which these guys were also
using to make their living.

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:34.510
So they're getting
squeezed on two ends

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:38.230
and they decide well there's one
way we can make money and we find

00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:43.240
out who's got it, we kidnap them
and then we hold them for ransom,

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:47.960
release them with the payment, with
the threat that we didn't hurt you

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:50.770
and we won't hurt you as long
as you don't go to the police.

00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:53.550
If you do, we'll come
back and kill not only you

00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:56.210
but your family as well.

00:19:56.210 --> 00:20:01.950
So between 1930 and 1933, there
were an estimated 2000 successful

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:03.920
kidnappings in the United States.

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:06.720
The whole money class
was becoming paranoid.

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:09.510
You had people like Bing
Crosby and Hollywood driving

00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:13.040
around in armor plated cars with
Army guards in the front seat.

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:16.520
You had people hiring protection

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:23.230
and the papers are just full
of all of these reports.

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:34.670
So, on the night of July 27,
1933, our hero George Kelly is

00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:40.200
about to pull off his kidnapping
with his partner Albert Bates.

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:45.510
Kelly has been a successful gin
runner for most of his life.

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:50.400 position:56%
Got into the business in high
school, running liquor from Arkansas

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:54.620
over to the dry state of
Tennessee and basically

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:55.920
with several interruptions

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:58.190
in between has been
doing that ever since.

00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:04.560
And after a landing in the
federal prison in Leavenworth

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:10.200 position:56%
where he met a couple of really hard
cases who teach him how to rob banks

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:13.830
and pull him into their
gang when he gets out.

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:20.880
He's been living kind of high on
the hog which is a great pleasure

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:27.010
to his new wife Kathryn Kelly who
is your classic gangster moll.

00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:31.700
She's very inquisitive,
very ruthless,

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:37.520
she loves designer clothing,
fancy jewelry, diamonds.

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:41.160
And she's always pushing
George to do more and more,

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.630
to be more and more successful.

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:50.650
So on the, on this evening at 11:30
at night, they break into the home

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:56.340
of Charles Urschel, it
should be next up here,

00:21:56.340 --> 00:22:00.220
who is one of the most
wealthy oil men in the nation.

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:02.430
And Kathryn has read
his story because his,

00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:08.700
his partner has just died and their
fortune has gone to probate court,

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:10.000
so there's a lot of coverage

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.730
about just how much money
Charles Urschel has.

00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:15.200
And he has a lot of it,
there's no doubt about that.

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:21.630
So she convinces George that
this should be their first mark.

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:26.560
However, Charles Urschel is an
unusual character on his own.

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:32.810 position:56%
He's an up from the ground sort of,
he grew up on a farm in the Midwest,

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:37.130
hated farming, enlisted in
the Army in World War I.

00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:40.600
Comes out and just decides he's
not going to go back to the farm

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:45.130
and picks up his belongings, takes
off for Oklahoma and Texas to see

00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:49.720
if he can make it in the oil
business which he eventually does

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:54.360
by teaming up with a partner, a guy
who later becomes known as the king

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:59.480
of the wildcatters with the
appropriate name of Tom Slick.

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:04.880
So this Slick-Urschel oil company
has just about got control of all

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:12.490
of the land stakes in Oklahoma
and Texas and when Tom dies,

00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:15.870
all of that stuff is
in the newspapers

00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:19.080
which Kathryn read assiduously.

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:28.330
So they tracked down Urschel's
home and at 11:30 at night,

00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:31.970
Kelly and Bates kick in the screen
door and confront two couples

00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:35.090
who are playing bridge on
their sun porch which is

00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:39.080
in the back of this house.

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:44.310
Kelly's got a machine gun and
Bates has a 45 and they look

00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:49.210 position:56%
at the startled couples and George
realizes he hasn't done quite enough

00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:53.180
research because he doesn't
know which one is Urschel.

00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:56.220
So he waves his gun around and
says okay we've come for Urschel,

00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:59.960
which one's Urschel and
neither guy stands up.

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:05.250 position:56%
So he says, all right we'll take you
both and then so they throw the two

00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:08.190
of them in the back to their car,
they speed off into the night.

00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:13.170
Kelly finally gets the idea
that he can ID these guys

00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:15.370
by taking the money out of
their wallets and looking

00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:18.260
at their IDs which he does.

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:22.730
And he discovers that he's also
got Walter Jerrod in the car.

00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:26.530
He doesn't realize that Walter
Jerrod is also an oil millionaire

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:28.920
but he kicks him out of the car,

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:33.620
gives him $10 for a cab ride back
home and takes off with Urschel.

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:37.770 position:56%
Pulls over to the side of the road,
tapes his eyes shut, plugs his ears,

00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:43.910
tapes those shut and for the next
8 days Urschel is basically blind

00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:47.050
and somewhat deaf.

00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:53.960 position:56%
They spirit him off to Kathryn
Kelly's father-in-law's farm outside

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:57.780
of Dallas, Texas in Wise
County where they hold him

00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:01.860
for the next 8 days and force him
to write a number of ransom notes.

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:06.460
However, the entire time
Urschel is held in captivity,

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:08.840
he's collecting notes
about where he is

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:14.480
by strategically asking questions,
making notes of what's going on

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:19.240
and he, he's basically the oil
company's chief accountant.

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:22.610
But I guess now you'll call
him a chief financial officer,

00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:26.520 position:56%
so he's got a great mind for details
and he doesn't forget anything.

00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:31.470
So he figures he's on a farm, he
figures out how many buildings are

00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:33.940
on the farm and how big
it is, he knows what kind

00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:36.700
of animals are there, he
counts the number of animals,

00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:39.070
he knows what the water tastes
like, what the well sounds

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:42.510
like when you pull
water out from it.

00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:46.590
He notes the name of the
postman that comes every day,

00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:48.970
he knows the name of the
local prostitute that one

00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:51.740
of the captures is talking about.

00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:58.060
And he also notes that a plane
goes overhead every day at 9:30 am

00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:01.640
and at 5:30 pm going the
other direction, every day

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:04.140
but one and he notes that day.

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:07.790
And he's also leaving his
fingerprints strategically

00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:11.990
around any place that he can.

00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:18.190
So, when he is finally
released, he goes back home.

00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:20.710
Of course the authorities
have already been alerted

00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:24.980
because his wife Bernice,
within minutes

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:28.940
of his abduction calls J.
Edgar Hoover's hotline.

00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:34.880 position:56%
And it rings at the justice
department, the operator there says,

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:37.560
I'll put you through to
Mr. Hoover immediately.

00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:40.110
Hoover has had a line run
all the way to his house.

00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:43.080
He's in bed sleeping and he
takes a call from Bernice

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:46.880
at what was then 1:30 am here.

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:49.500
And she says, this
is Bernie Urschel,

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:51.640
I'd like to report a kidnapping.

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:54.440
And he says, this J.
Edgar Hoover Mrs. Urschel,

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:56.570
tell me everything you can.

00:26:56.570 --> 00:27:00.400
So when Urschel returns
to his house,

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:02.090 position:56%
the front yard is loaded with media.

00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:08.450
It's got news reel photographers,
newspaper photographers, reporters,

00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:12.840
sound men and of course a number
of law enforcement officers.

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:18.040
He goes inside and subsequently
is debriefed by one of the agents

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:22.940
that Hoover has sent down
to run this investigation.

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:29.760
And after talking for 2 1/2 hours,
the FBI or the Bureau's agent says,

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:32.090
well you know, I thought this was
going to be like finding a needle

00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:35.910
in a haystack but this is
a pretty small haystack.

00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:40.600 position:56%
So they subsequently get in a plane,
one of the oil company's planes,

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:42.760
they fly low over the area

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:48.860 position:56%
where they triangulated the airplane
crossings and they look down

00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:50.980
and Urschel has drawn a
map of what it looks like

00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:54.050
and lo and behold there it is.

00:27:54.050 --> 00:27:58.720
So they decided to stage a raid
and Urschel insists that he be

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:01.360 position:56%
in the front car of the rating party

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:05.140
with a sawed off shotgun
seeking justice.

00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:11.770
So this story isn't just
about this particular crime,

00:28:11.770 --> 00:28:19.870 position:56%
but it's also about the power of
publicity and this is kind of an era

00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:23.650
where the mass media
is being born as well.

00:28:23.650 --> 00:28:26.020
I have huge regional newspapers,

00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:32.090
the first radio news broadcast
has just started, NBCs.

00:28:32.090 --> 00:28:38.740
And along with the creation of
the mass media is the creation

00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:43.020
of the organizations that
try to manipulate the media.

00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:46.680
And no one was better at
it than J. Edgar Hoover.

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:51.550 position:56%
So all along during this case Hoover
is managing the message and building

00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:58.480
out the reputations of his agents
as they chase Kelly and his wife

00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:01.450
who were not at the farm
when the raid staged

00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:03.140
across of the rest
of the United States.

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:08.360
So this is one of the posters that
he had made for publicity purposes

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:12.240
of course showing the need for
a national police force that was

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:15.550
in power to cross state lines
to track down criminals.

00:29:15.550 --> 00:29:21.150 position:56%
Keep in mind too that at the time
that this crime occurred, FBI agents

00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:25.680
or bureau agents did not
have the power of arrest.

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:28.290
They had to bring in a local
police officer to do that.

00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:30.230
They didn't carry weapons.

00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:32.540
They were not trained
how to carry weapons.

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:37.910 position:56%
They were basically a group of guys,
very similar to J. Edgar Hoover.

00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:41.400
They were lawyers or
accountants and they would go

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:46.070
in to assist local law enforcement
as they built their case.

00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:50.310
So suddenly, Hoover finds himself
up against these gun coating,

00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:53.220
toting criminals and he
really doesn't have much

00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:55.330
of a force to go after them.

00:29:55.330 --> 00:30:01.420
He looks around his country
offices and decides that of the 300

00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:07.890
or more agents that he's got, maybe
12, 15 have the kind of training

00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:09.780
and skills to chase down people

00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:14.040
like John Dillinger
and Machine Gun Kelly.

00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:18.030
So he assembles that
force to go after Kelly.

00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:20.040
Those are some of the
places they went.

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:23.720
And so they created this
nice graphic about the number

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:29.720
of kidnappings that were
going on around the world.

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:35.440
And again, gets that out in
the press, builds up the sense

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:39.790 position:56%
of paranoia over kidnapping scourge.

00:30:39.790 --> 00:30:43.580
This is one of Hoover's
key agents, Melvin Purvis,

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:45.390
you've probably heard of him.

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:51.570
He was like Hoover, a trained
lawyer, an investigator

00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:55.130
with no military training,
no police training.

00:30:55.130 --> 00:31:00.810 position:56%
But when Hoover gets his assignment,
he takes Purvis and sends him

00:31:00.810 --> 00:31:05.060 position:56%
to run the Chicago office which is
probably the toughest office the FBI

00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:07.510
has to deal with.

00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:13.230
He subsequently fails to find
Kelly when he makes his trip

00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:15.730
through Chicago, that's
another story.

00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:19.150
Eventually though they do
track him down in his home town

00:31:19.150 --> 00:31:23.130
of Memphis Tennessee after
about 8 weeks on the road.

00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:25.960 position:56%
This is him being led off in chains.

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:29.750
The story about his capture
is interesting as well.

00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:36.040 position:56%
Hoover of course as this coverage
is going on over the weeks and weeks

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:39.670
and weeks of their, that
they're chasing Hoover,

00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:43.840
it's making national headlines
around the country and in Europe.

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:49.000
And but it's always Kelly gets
away again, Kelly gets away again.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.540
In a lot of cases the press was
ahead of the bureau's agents.

00:31:53.540 --> 00:32:01.170
When Kelly was hiding out in
Mississippi, he's just checked

00:32:01.170 --> 00:32:06.630
into his hotel room and he walks
out and a newsboy walks by saying,

00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:08.620
Kelly thought to be in Mississippi.

00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:10.630
He turns around, goes
back in, checks out,

00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:14.260
gets in his car, takes
off to Louisiana.

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:20.050
So after, so he and Kathryn had
been running around the country

00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:23.770
for a couple of months trying
to stay away from the law.

00:32:23.770 --> 00:32:27.400
They end up back in
Mississippi, I'm sorry yeah,

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:31.250
in Tennessee, in Memphis.

00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:36.670
And the bureau finds out that he's
there and they put a raid together

00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:42.790
and they come in, I mean they're
armed up like the U.S. Army.

00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:46.260
They open his front door,
they go searching his house.

00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:49.380
Basically what they're finding
are a lot of empty liquor bottles

00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:52.880
and glamorous Kathryn is
asleep in some silk pajamas.

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:58.320
And finally, Kelly walks out
of the bathroom, sees the,

00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:01.460
all the guns pointed at him,
he drops his gun and says,

00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:04.590
I wondered when you guys
were going to get here.

00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:07.060
But of course that's not a
good enough story for the take

00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:10.840
down of the most notorious
outlaw in the United States.

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:13.960
So when Hoover gets
done telling the story

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:17.290
and when his agents get done
explaining what happened,

00:33:17.290 --> 00:33:22.250
it's that the agents come in, they
confront Kelly, he drops his gun,

00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:25.870
he cowers in the corner and
says, don't shoot G Men,

00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:32.760
that term he never used but
a term that Hoover liked.

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:38.480
And it became the moniker of the
FBI for the next 40 or more years.

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:40.590
They continued to tell
that story even

00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:43.810
in their own publicity
materials a few years ago.

00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:45.780
You can still find
it out their website.

00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:48.690
But they've now begun
to recount a little bit

00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:54.980
about what actually what
have happened there.

00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:56.280
So they bring him to trial.

00:33:56.280 --> 00:34:00.390
This is, this is Kathryn
and George in court.

00:34:00.390 --> 00:34:04.040 position:56%
Kathryn is looking very fashionable.

00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:08.130
George is a little bit bloated
from two weeks of binge drinking

00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:12.610
and the fact that he's been
recently pistol whipped by one

00:34:12.610 --> 00:34:14.980
of the bureau's agents
right there in the courtroom

00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:17.670
in full view of everybody.

00:34:17.670 --> 00:34:24.540
You can see a little closer
there the knot on his forehead.

00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:27.520
He was trying to defend
Kathryn's honor

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:32.490
after she slapped one
of Hoover's agents.

00:34:32.490 --> 00:34:36.320
So the trial of course
makes for big news.

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:44.020 position:56%
It's, it's the first federal trial
and one of the last to allow cameras

00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:46.670
in the courtroom, motion
picture cameras.

00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:52.070
There was a news reel made of this
trial that played in movie theaters

00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:54.200
around the country for weeks.

00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:57.510
People would stand up and
cheer when it was over.

00:34:57.510 --> 00:35:00.760
Kelly, his wife, 11
other people involved

00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:02.890
in the crime are successfully
convicted.

00:35:02.890 --> 00:35:06.790 position:56%
And they're all sentenced to life
in prison including Kathryn's mother

00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:09.410
who really did nothing
more than make a meal

00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:14.660 position:56%
for Urschel when he was at the farm.

00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:18.900
So building on this, on
this case, Homer Cummings

00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:24.350
who was the attorney
general and Hoover decide

00:35:24.350 --> 00:35:27.390
that the federal prison system
is just not strong enough

00:35:27.390 --> 00:35:28.690
to hold these guys.

00:35:28.690 --> 00:35:32.120
I mean most of them have broken
out of prison multiple times

00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:36.100
by bribing guards, by
having people on the outside

00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:38.500
and they were notoriously
porous prisons.

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:42.110
So they wanted to create something
which would be a penal colony

00:35:42.110 --> 00:35:44.090
for what they call
the Irredeemables,

00:35:44.090 --> 00:35:45.460
the worst of the worst.

00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:50.190
People like George Kelly,
Al Capone and the rest

00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:51.850
of the criminal class at the time.

00:35:51.850 --> 00:35:57.430
And they do, they reopen what used
to be a military prison dating back

00:35:57.430 --> 00:36:03.260
to the civil war on Alcatraz Island
and opened it with great fanfare.

00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:07.470 position:56%
George Kelly is in the initial class
going in and he will spend most

00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:09.240
of the rest of his life there.

00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:11.690
Kathryn is sent off
to a women's prison.

00:36:11.690 --> 00:36:15.800
They conduct a long
time correspondence

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:20.550
with one another writing great
love letters back and forth.

00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:23.480
One of the things that Kelly
really liked to do was write.

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:25.000
He was quite good at it.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:30.860
He was not a criminal who was
kind of up from poverty class.

00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:32.160
He wasn't a psychopath.

00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:34.690
He was a pretty smart guy,
actually went to college

00:36:34.690 --> 00:36:36.390
for one semester before
he flunked out.

00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:41.770
He grew up in a middle
class family and really,

00:36:41.770 --> 00:36:46.150
one of the interesting
understories in this is the romance

00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:49.630
between Kathryn and George
because they're quite a couple

00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:55.510
as you could imagine they had a lot
of really great family arguments.

00:36:55.510 --> 00:37:00.280
[ Silence ]

00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:04.250
After the trial, the
trial was presided in fact

00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:12.310
by Charles Urschel's good
hunting partner and fishing buddy.

00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:15.960
So a conviction was more or
less a foregone conclusion,

00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:21.710
it only took one day in a matter
of hours to return the verdict.

00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:26.800
Urschel never really wanted
any, any credit for this case

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:29.820
or any kind of publicity.

00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:32.620
He didn't like being in the
limelight, being an oil man

00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:34.970
and he tried to keep
his business secret.

00:37:34.970 --> 00:37:38.880
So he basically fades
into the background.

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:41.830
And he instructs everyone
in his family

00:37:41.830 --> 00:37:44.230
to take a similar position
with the press.

00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:46.680
Don't talk to them, don't
get your name in the paper,

00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:48.420
don't let them take your picture,

00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:51.540
you could end up getting
kidnapped, who knows.

00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:55.300
And so strong were his
admonitions that it's his children

00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:59.770
that did pretty remarkable things
also stayed out of the limelight

00:37:59.770 --> 00:38:03.730
and even when I'm was
researching this book and go back

00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:05.030
and I'm talking

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:07.690
to his grandchildren,
they're even reluctant.

00:38:07.690 --> 00:38:12.050
You know, they call him big
Charles and the admonitions

00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:14.320 position:56%
from Big Charles hold up even today.

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:17.950
Keep going, the wrong way.

00:38:17.950 --> 00:38:24.380
A part of the publicity
that Hoover managed

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:28.570
to orchestrate was control
of the movie industry.

00:38:28.570 --> 00:38:34.580
The movie, Public Enemy
starring James Cagney came

00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:38.060
out in 1933 I believe.

00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:42.860
And Cagney plays a Scarface,
Al Capone type criminal

00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:47.350
and he's the hero of the story
and that just drove Hoover crazy.

00:38:47.350 --> 00:38:49.530
And he complained to Hollywood,

00:38:49.530 --> 00:38:52.280
he complained to the
production companies and he said,

00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:53.680
you're glamourizing criminals.

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:57.720
You're making my job harder, you
should glamourize FBI agents.

00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:01.750
And at the time they were getting a
lot of pressure from others as well

00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:06.570
and they start their own code,
sort of a pre censorship code

00:39:06.570 --> 00:39:10.770 position:56%
and they say you can't make gangster
movies anymore unless you have an

00:39:10.770 --> 00:39:12.920
FBI agent in them.

00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:18.230
But the caveat was that if you
have an FBI agent in your movie,

00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:20.550
J. Edgar Hoover gets
script approval.

00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:23.790
So two years after
the kidnapping case,

00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:29.180
G Men comes out starring James
Cagney, who is an FBI agent,

00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:35.580
who successfully solves
a kidnapping case.

00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:38.250
Machine Gun Kelly didn't
fare so well in Hollywood.

00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:44.730
In 1958, Roger Corman, king of
the B moviemakers creates a movie

00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:48.210
about Machine Gun Kelly
in which he's described

00:39:48.210 --> 00:39:55.850 position:56%
as a dangerous psychopath, machine
gun wielding hood, a cruel kidnapper

00:39:55.850 --> 00:39:58.750
and establishes, it's so successful

00:39:58.750 --> 00:40:02.890
that it established Charles
Bronson as a leading man.

00:40:02.890 --> 00:40:04.770
That was his first role.

00:40:04.770 --> 00:40:09.690
Meanwhile, George is
wasting away in Alcatraz.

00:40:09.690 --> 00:40:12.490
Ultimately he's released
back Leavenworth

00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:14.680
where he dies of a heart attack.

00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:20.530
And that's pretty much
where the show ends.

00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:24.510
I'd like to take your questions
at all if you have any.

00:40:24.510 --> 00:40:27.050
[ Applause ]

00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:28.850
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:40:28.850 --> 00:40:32.510
[ Applause ]

00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:36.590
[ Silence ]

00:40:36.590 --> 00:40:37.890
Yes.

00:40:37.890 --> 00:40:39.950
&gt;&gt; Did his wife stay
married or did she?

00:40:39.950 --> 00:40:42.320
&gt;&gt; Could you repeat the question?

00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:46.730
&gt;&gt; So the question is whether
Kathryn stayed married to George.

00:40:46.730 --> 00:40:48.450
And yes she did.

00:40:48.450 --> 00:40:53.880
She spent most of her life,
she never admitted to anything.

00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:59.350
And during the trial, she actually
got George to take the blame

00:40:59.350 --> 00:41:02.400
for everything and to
say she wasn't involved.

00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:06.240
Because she thought it would
be better if one of them were

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:09.240
out on the loose and not
both of them in prison.

00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:14.690
And he agreed to do
that to his credit.

00:41:14.690 --> 00:41:17.000
So he basically lied
about her involvement.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.800
Nevertheless, she was
sentenced to life.

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:28.370
She's in prison in the late 40s
and ends up with a fellow prisoner,

00:41:28.370 --> 00:41:31.990
a woman who is known as Axis
Sally, she was a propagandist

00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:34.860
for the Japanese during
World War II.

00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:40.240
And she had a real firebrand lawyer
who was trying to get her out.

00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:45.070
Kathryn of course meets this
guy and enlists him in her cause

00:41:45.070 --> 00:41:49.620
which he agrees to take because
he thinks the trial was a sham

00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:54.080 position:56%
and that the evidence was fabricated
and it was just a total circus

00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:56.910
which to his credit it really was.

00:41:56.910 --> 00:42:03.060
So he asks for a new trial
and the judge grants it.

00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:06.770
However, the FBI refuses to
release any of its material.

00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:12.340
Partly, it's thought because
they couldn't find it.

00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:16.660
Partly, because they knew it
would prove Kathryn's case.

00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:19.840
So with their refusal to cooperate,

00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:24.790
the judge just releases
Kathryn and her mother.

00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:30.710
And so she, she ends up working
as an accountant in what they used

00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:33.130
to call a poor farm
where her mother lived.

00:42:33.130 --> 00:42:35.780
And just took care of her
for the rest of her life.

00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:37.630
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:42:37.630 --> 00:42:42.170
&gt;&gt; How much was the ransom
that was paid for Charles?

00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:46.470
&gt;&gt; It was $200,000 which
was the largest amount paid

00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:49.820
at that time depending on
how you calculate you know,

00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:52.690 position:56%
the inflation rate, that's between 7

00:42:52.690 --> 00:42:54.910
and $14 million in
contemporary money.

00:42:54.910 --> 00:42:56.210
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:42:56.210 --> 00:43:04.210
&gt;&gt; Didn't they have the death
penalty during that time?

00:43:04.210 --> 00:43:07.500
I'm assuming that he killed
people in his pursuit.

00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:10.400
&gt;&gt; Oh the question is didn't
they have the death penalty

00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:15.720
and hadn't he killed people in
the process of robbing banks.

00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:18.480
And that's the interest,
that's a great question.

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:20.780
That's the interesting
thing about George Kelly.

00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:24.370
He didn't like gun play at all.

00:43:24.370 --> 00:43:28.030
He was part of a system of
bank robbing which relied

00:43:28.030 --> 00:43:31.460
on events planning and surprise

00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:35.680
and the last thing he wanted
was attention or violence.

00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:39.110
He preferred robbing
banks with a concealed 38.

00:43:39.110 --> 00:43:43.520 position:56%
And he was such a you know, charming
and outgoing fellow that he'd go

00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:46.440
into the bank, the tellers
would think he was a customer.

00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:49.320
He'd walk up to the tellers
and toss over his bags

00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:51.240
and say, fill 'em up girls.

00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:53.650
And they would comply
and usually he'd walk

00:43:53.650 --> 00:43:56.600
out before the alarm went off.

00:43:56.600 --> 00:44:01.140
But Kathryn, she Kathryn
was you know,

00:44:01.140 --> 00:44:03.190
she wanted to see her
name in lights.

00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:05.990
And she thought the way
she would get there was

00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:08.640
by being married to
this famous gangster.

00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:12.100
So she is the one that tried
to toughen up his reputation.

00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:16.620
She bought him the machine
gun, bought it at a pawn shop

00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:20.480
in Fort Worth, gave it to
him as a present and took him

00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:22.870
down to the farm to try and
teach him how to use it.

00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:28.440
And then she spent all of her days
trying to build up his reputation.

00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:34.290 position:56%
She'd go to speakeasys and taverns
in and around Dallas and Fort Worth.

00:44:34.290 --> 00:44:38.000 position:56%
And she'd talk about how good George
had gotten with the machine gun.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.650
He could shoot walnuts
off a fence post.

00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:44.590
He could write his name on
the side of a barn with it.

00:44:44.590 --> 00:44:52.580
And all of that gossip kind of got
to the Fort Worth and Dallas police

00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:55.060
who began to build a
profile of this guy

00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:57.120
because they were suspicious
of him anyway.

00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:00.650
Because it's a relatively
poor community at the time

00:45:00.650 --> 00:45:04.750
and he's driving a 16 cylinder
Cadillac with white wall tires

00:45:04.750 --> 00:45:09.960
and you know, customized features.

00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:14.110
So it's that reputation
that Hoover's men pick up.

00:45:14.110 --> 00:45:18.230
And so when the wanted poster
goes out for Kelly, he's described

00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:23.290
as an expert machine gunner
and psychopathic killer.

00:45:23.290 --> 00:45:25.930
But you're right, they did
not have a death penalty

00:45:25.930 --> 00:45:28.200
for kidnapping at the time.

00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:32.000
That's why they got it into
the subsequent crime bill

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.300
to make it such.

00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:34.600
Yes sir.

00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:37.490 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Did he in fact ever kill anybody?

00:45:37.490 --> 00:45:39.030
&gt;&gt; He's not known to
have killed anyone.

00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:45.480
The only, the only violence he's,
well he certainly fired his gun

00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:49.900
in anger a number of
times, but he's known only

00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:56.920
to have wounded one bank guard who
surprised him during a robbery,

00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:58.220
shot him in the shoulder.

00:45:58.220 --> 00:46:01.540
&gt;&gt; How many banks did he rob?

00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:02.840
&gt;&gt; How many banks?

00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:04.140
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:05.440
&gt;&gt; I don't know the total number

00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:09.740
because he wasn't accused
of all of them.

00:46:09.740 --> 00:46:11.790 position:56%
He got away successfully most times.

00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:15.170
But during the height of
his is about 1 a month.

00:46:15.170 --> 00:46:17.510
Yes sir?

00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:21.720
[ Inaudible ]

00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:23.020
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:27.370
&gt;&gt; What happened to Urschel?

00:46:27.370 --> 00:46:29.450
&gt;&gt; What happened to
Big Charles Urschel?

00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:33.110 position:56%
He continued to run his oil company.

00:46:33.110 --> 00:46:38.140
He spent a lot of time in the
safer environment of Europe.

00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:42.540
He would tour Europe with his
wife for extended periods of time.

00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:44.280
He collected art.

00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:48.270
He bank rolled his
son's establishment

00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:55.430
of a bioresearch mater, bioresearch
center in I think its San Antonio.

00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:59.330
And he basically, you know,
lived out of the spotlight.

00:46:59.330 --> 00:47:03.700
He too died of a heart
attack in 1972.

00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:05.000
Yeah.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:08.740 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Did they ever get the money back?

00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:14.580
&gt;&gt; They got, they got
all of Urschel's take.

00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:17.560
So I'm sorry, they
got all of Kelly's.

00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:23.450
Kelly had buried his money at
one of Kathryn's relative's farms

00:47:23.450 --> 00:47:25.960
and subsequently they
found out where it was.

00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:27.290
They went and dug it up.

00:47:27.290 --> 00:47:31.620
His share was about $96,000.

00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:36.910 position:56%
They had some expenses they needed
to cover and Bates got the other 96.

00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:41.010
They never found all of Bates'
money which is one reason

00:47:41.010 --> 00:47:47.730
that Urschel would not cooperate
with parole for either of them.

00:47:47.730 --> 00:47:51.590
He thought Bates knew where
the money was and he wanted

00:47:51.590 --> 00:47:53.600
to get and he wanted it back.

00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:57.050
Consequently, he didn't
let up on either of them.

00:47:57.050 --> 00:47:58.850
And he thought Urschel could get,

00:47:58.850 --> 00:48:02.640
he thought Kelly could get
the information from Bates

00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:06.020
and Kelly refused to do it.

00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:07.620
So it's still sitting
out there somewhere.

00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:12.130
It's thought to be buried in
the Pacific Northwest somewhere.

00:48:12.130 --> 00:48:16.150
Probably pretty well
decomposed by now.

00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:17.450
Yes, yes.

00:48:17.450 --> 00:48:19.800
&gt;&gt; I really enjoyed the book.

00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:21.130
And I couldn't believe.

00:48:21.130 --> 00:48:23.810
I'm really thinking
about Kelly here.

00:48:23.810 --> 00:48:27.280
And the letter he wrote
from Alcatraz

00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:33.730
to Attorney General Cummings about
this proposal that he be sent,

00:48:33.730 --> 00:48:37.120
while he was serving his
sentence to some Pacific Island

00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:39.870
to do meteorological research.

00:48:39.870 --> 00:48:41.360
Do you want to mention that?

00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:43.270
And it was a very literate letter.

00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:44.850
It was really a nice letter.

00:48:44.850 --> 00:48:50.530
He did, he was going crazy
in Alcatraz as anyone would

00:48:50.530 --> 00:48:54.890 position:56%
and he was desperate to get off and
so he writes to the attorney general

00:48:54.890 --> 00:49:01.350
and he basically volunteers to take
any exploratory scientific mission

00:49:01.350 --> 00:49:03.960
that the country might
think it needs.

00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:09.470 position:56%
He'll go to a deserted island in
the Pacific and track wind currents.

00:49:09.470 --> 00:49:12.960
He'll go to Alaska and
study this or that.

00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:15.060
He makes a number of
these proposals.

00:49:15.060 --> 00:49:18.470
He's read about it in one
of the News Weeklys I think.

00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:23.360
And of course prison officials
aren't used to getting these kinds

00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:25.200
of letters nor is the
attorney general.

00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:28.840
And so they just basically
scoffed at it

00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:32.130
and denied the request of course.

00:49:32.130 --> 00:49:38.700
But it was just, if further proof
of how ingenious the guy could be,

00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:41.470
when he was first taken
into Alcatraz

00:49:41.470 --> 00:49:43.320
of course they give
him psychological tests

00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:47.770
and intelligence tests and he
scored at the top of all them.

00:49:47.770 --> 00:49:51.150
He was not, he was deemed to
be a relatively normal guy.

00:49:51.150 --> 00:49:52.490
Pretty smart.

00:49:52.490 --> 00:49:56.500
He enrolled in correspondence
courses, at, from USC,

00:49:56.500 --> 00:49:59.860
University of Southern California.

00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:02.180
And he and Bates kind of
have a competition to see

00:50:02.180 --> 00:50:08.420 position:56%
who could do better in their classes
and so he tried to entertain himself

00:50:08.420 --> 00:50:10.480
through advancement and education.

00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:12.080
They were not allowed
to listen to the radio.

00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:16.340
They had very limited
entertainment options.

00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:22.370
At one point, in order to get
some music into the place,

00:50:22.370 --> 00:50:26.210
they'd form a band and they
get permission to do this.

00:50:26.210 --> 00:50:32.230
Al Capone plays the, I think he
played mandolin or the guitar.

00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:34.380
Kelly played the drums.

00:50:34.380 --> 00:50:40.170
And another notorious criminal,
Alvin Carpus played guitar as well.

00:50:40.170 --> 00:50:45.360
Carpus committed two kidnappings
just before he was caught.

00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:52.580
Carpus was Canadian, was later
released to a federal prison in,

00:50:52.580 --> 00:50:55.650
out West, I think in
northern California

00:50:55.650 --> 00:50:58.340
where he meets Charles Manson.

00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:00.620
And Charles Manson wants him

00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:03.510
to teach him how play
the guitar which he does.

00:51:03.510 --> 00:51:09.060
[ Silence ]

00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:11.510
Okay well thank you very much.

00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:19.040
[ Applause ]

00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:20.340
&gt;&gt; Well thank you Joe.

00:51:20.340 --> 00:51:22.140
As I said, it's a terrific book.

00:51:22.140 --> 00:51:24.190
It was a pleasure to have you here.

00:51:24.190 --> 00:51:28.280
When you go out, there's also
a notice about a talk we have

00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:32.330
on Thursday, which is Richard
Moe, staying in the same era.

00:51:32.330 --> 00:51:36.330
We'll talk about and sign his
book, Roosevelt's Second Act,

00:51:36.330 --> 00:51:39.350
The Election of 1940
in the Politics of War.

00:51:39.350 --> 00:51:43.010
And also there's a
survey if you get one

00:51:43.010 --> 00:51:47.630 position:56%
of the news releases using your cell
phone, you could fill out a form

00:51:47.630 --> 00:51:52.020
which is how you first
learned about this program,

00:51:52.020 --> 00:51:55.370
because we're now working
on that as a library.

00:51:55.370 --> 00:51:58.410
But let's conclude with another
round of applause for Joe Urschel.

00:51:58.410 --> 00:52:02.170
A wonderful presentation.

00:52:02.170 --> 00:52:05.820
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
