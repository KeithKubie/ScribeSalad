Hello!
I am not Hank.

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:04.880
I am Nicole and I’m usually a behind-the-scenes
member of the Crash Course staff,

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.480
but for the next year
I will be here, teaching you about sociology.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.340
We’ve covered a lot of things here at Crash
Course and sociology has kind of been lurking
about throughout all of them.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.120
Sociology is the study of people and society and
that includes a really broad range of topics –

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:23.960
everything from social and economic
inequalities to marriage and family formation
to political and religious institutions.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.720
Sociologists answer questions like,

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.140
“What is class and why does almost every
American seem to think that they’re middle class?”

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.560
or “How do different political institutions
change the cultural norms of a society?”

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.920
or “Why do some societies end up with more
unequal outcomes than other societies?”

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.700
Sociology is the study of how we form societies
and how those societies form us as individuals.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:49.540
While a world history class might tell you about
how different races and ethnicities have been
discriminated against in the past and present,

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:55.800
sociology tells us how we’ve constructed
racial and ethnic groups and why social
inequalities exist along racial lines.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.620
An economist might create models of how
the wage an individual is offered by a firm
affects their well-being,

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.640
whereas a sociologist might look at how the
neighborhoods and communities that a person
grows up in affects their well-being.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.160
And understanding these questions can help
us make big decisions about the kind of world
that we want to live in

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.600
and the kind of people that we want to be
in that world.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.500
So I hope you’ll join me over the next
year as we explore all of this and more in
Crash Course Sociology.
