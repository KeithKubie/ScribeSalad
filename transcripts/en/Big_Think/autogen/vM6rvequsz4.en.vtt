started fighting as I said about ten to

there is evidence of settlements and of

there is evidence of settlements and of
 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.160
there is evidence of settlements and of

fairly complex societies before that
 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.679

with no evidence of warfare so I think

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689
with no evidence of warfare so I think
 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.449
with no evidence of warfare so I think
it's really important for people to know

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459
it's really important for people to know
 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.180
it's really important for people to know
this basic fact that war is actually

this basic fact that war is actually
 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.600
this basic fact that war is actually
quite a recent

behavior one of the reasons that people
 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.250
behavior one of the reasons that people
tell me we will always fight Wars is

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260
tell me we will always fight Wars is
 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.800

male aggression to fight and so forth I

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240
male aggression to fight and so forth I
 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.710
male aggression to fight and so forth I
think that's easily refuted just because

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720
think that's easily refuted just because
 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.360
think that's easily refuted just because
war is so recent and there's this

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370
war is so recent and there's this
 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.930

enormous variability between cultures so

permanent part of the human condition is

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860
permanent part of the human condition is
 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.040
permanent part of the human condition is
that there are always too many people

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050
that there are always too many people
 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.530
that there are always too many people
for the available resources and so you

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540
for the available resources and so you
 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.080
for the available resources and so you
inevitably get this kind of Malthusian

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090
inevitably get this kind of Malthusian
 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.300
inevitably get this kind of Malthusian
situation where people are struggling

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310
situation where people are struggling

of things the problem is is that if you

of things the problem is is that if you
 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.090
of things the problem is is that if you
do a statistical analysis and you look

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100
do a statistical analysis and you look
 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.260
do a statistical analysis and you look
at armed conflicts through history there

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270
at armed conflicts through history there
 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.420
at armed conflicts through history there
are some conflicts where clearly there

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430
are some conflicts where clearly there
 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.380

World War one is a really good example

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470
World War one is a really good example
 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.070

the theory that resource scarcity leads
 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.960
the theory that resource scarcity leads

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450
and then raced back to their villages
 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.380
and then raced back to their villages
and of course that leads to a feud

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390
and of course that leads to a feud
 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.380
and of course that leads to a feud
what Chagnon has found is that there was

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390
what Chagnon has found is that there was
 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.980
what Chagnon has found is that there was
an inverse correlation between the

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990
an inverse correlation between the
 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.810
an inverse correlation between the
population density because the Yanam

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820
population density because the Yanam
 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.960
population density because the Yanam
Yanomami are spread over a very wide

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970
Yanomami are spread over a very wide
 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.290
Yanomami are spread over a very wide
region of the amazon so he has gone to

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300
region of the amazon so he has gone to
 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.830
region of the amazon so he has gone to
different places and found that the more

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840
different places and found that the more
 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.820
different places and found that the more
densely populated these tribal people

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830
densely populated these tribal people
 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.770
densely populated these tribal people
are and the less food they have

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780
are and the less food they have
 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.320
are and the less food they have
available the less war there is so it's

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330
available the less war there is so it's
 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.390
available the less war there is so it's
exactly the opposite of what you'd

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400
exactly the opposite of what you'd
 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.180
exactly the opposite of what you'd
expect the really sparsely populated

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190
expect the really sparsely populated
 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.890
expect the really sparsely populated
regions where there's plenty of game to

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900
regions where there's plenty of game to
 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.230
regions where there's plenty of game to
go around those according to Chagnon

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240
go around those according to Chagnon
 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.890
go around those according to Chagnon
tend to be the most violent regions so

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900
tend to be the most violent regions so
 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.790
tend to be the most violent regions so
Chagnon thinks that if anything it's

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800
Chagnon thinks that if anything it's
 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.740
Chagnon thinks that if anything it's
because the more protein you have the

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750
because the more protein you have the
 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.680
because the more protein you have the
more well-fed you are the more energy

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690
more well-fed you are the more energy
 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.560
more well-fed you are the more energy
you have for this kind of sport that the

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.570
you have for this kind of sport that the
 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.860
you have for this kind of sport that the
automata will see warfare as and the

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870
automata will see warfare as and the
 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.270
automata will see warfare as and the
more they're struggling just to feed

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280
more they're struggling just to feed
 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.730
more they're struggling just to feed
themselves the the the less energy they

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740
themselves the the the less energy they
 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.610
themselves the the the less energy they
have for warfare
