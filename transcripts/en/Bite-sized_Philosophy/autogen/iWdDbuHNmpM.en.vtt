they were doing but you know the
 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.189
they were doing but you know the
negative reasons were there too and you

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199
negative reasons were there too and you
 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.720
negative reasons were there too and you
could easily make it in a case that the

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730
could easily make it in a case that the
 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.549

that kind of muddied the water right
 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.759
that kind of muddied the water right
because the fascists were bad and then

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769
because the fascists were bad and then
 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:31.050
because the fascists were bad and then
that sort of means that people that are

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060

to be radical socialists at that point
 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:40.440
to be radical socialists at that point
in human history because the plight of

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450
in human history because the plight of
 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.660
in human history because the plight of
the working man was relatively

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670

unpleasant George Orwell wrote a book

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890
unpleasant George Orwell wrote a book
 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.449
unpleasant George Orwell wrote a book
called Road to Wigan Pier and he went up

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459
called Road to Wigan Pier and he went up
 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.240
called Road to Wigan Pier and he went up
to this town that was a coal mining town

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250
to this town that was a coal mining town
 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.160
to this town that was a coal mining town
and he he stayed with the coal miners

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170
and he he stayed with the coal miners
 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.960
and he he stayed with the coal miners
for a while and just looked at their

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970
for a while and just looked at their
 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.440
for a while and just looked at their
life so here here's a part of their life

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450
life so here here's a part of their life
 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.210
life so here here's a part of their life
so you basically work a seven and a half

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220
so you basically work a seven and a half
 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.009
so you basically work a seven and a half
hour shift when you're a coal miner you

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019
hour shift when you're a coal miner you
 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:03.809
hour shift when you're a coal miner you
think oh that's not too bad by 1930

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819
think oh that's not too bad by 1930
 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:07.500
think oh that's not too bad by 1930
standards it's like yeah except you have

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510
standards it's like yeah except you have
 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.160
standards it's like yeah except you have
to go down to them core mine tunnels you

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170
to go down to them core mine tunnels you
 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.979
to go down to them core mine tunnels you
know like they're not eight feet high

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989
know like they're not eight feet high
 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:15.839
know like they're not eight feet high
and carpeted they're like four and a

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:15.849
and carpeted they're like four and a
 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:17.849
and carpeted they're like four and a
half feet high and rough and poorly lit

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:17.859
half feet high and rough and poorly lit
 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:20.340
half feet high and rough and poorly lit
and the air is terrible and so basically
