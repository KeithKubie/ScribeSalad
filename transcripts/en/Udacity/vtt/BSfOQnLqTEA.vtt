00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.950
What is that we should be doing
to address cyber security?

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:09.150
How is the task of securing our system,
it is going to be addressed by us?

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.920
What are the things that
are available to us?

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.835
So one way you can reduce
vulnerability is by

00:00:14.835 --> 00:00:19.985
basically following some design
principles that are good for security.

00:00:19.985 --> 00:00:23.285
And when they're more secure,
there are fewer vulnerabilities, and

00:00:23.285 --> 00:00:25.435
less likely to be compromised.

00:00:25.435 --> 00:00:27.452
The complexity is always the enemy.

00:00:27.452 --> 00:00:31.502
The well established studies
that show whether it's bugs or

00:00:31.502 --> 00:00:34.432
performance related things,
or whatever it is.

00:00:34.432 --> 00:00:39.732
Those increase with the complexity or
size of lines of code for example.

00:00:39.732 --> 00:00:45.432
So one way to reduce vulnerabilities is,
what we call this economy of mechanism.

00:00:45.432 --> 00:00:50.760
Should be a small set of mechanisms that
your system fundamentally relies on.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.220
So avoid complexity.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.980
Keep it simple keep it small.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.120
Chances are that you are going to
have fewer vulnerabilities then.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.500
Now the design principle
is fail safe defaults.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.340
Fail safe defaults always
say when somebody may or

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.850
may not need access to some
sensitive data you deny it.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.550
If they really need it at
that point you can allow it.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.230
So default should be denied and

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.860
fail safety fault is that
the thing is protected.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.180
Access is controlled.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.520
Complete mediation says your
system should never allow

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.240
someone to bypass that monitor.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.600
The monitor has to mediate before
someone is able to gain access.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.580
To the resource.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.230
The idea is that someone who's
there to enforce that accesses

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:38.210
are those allowed by policy you have
in place then you can bypass it and

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.110
that's the complete
mediation requirement.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.100
A lot of people don't believe that
you can get security by obscurity.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.000
So if someone says well we
are secure because no one knows

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.160
how we do something.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.860
Well don't count on that.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.520
Perhaps somebody smart can reverse
engineer and learn most of it.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.730
So Open Design is good because
we're not counting on somebody

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.680
in not finding out how we do things.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.800
An extremely important design principle
is what's called least privilege.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.890
So in systems at any time, essentially
when you're running an application or

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.810
a program, you have the privilege to
be able to access a set of resources.

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.330
Least privilege says you should
only have privileges for

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.410
resources that you absolutely need,
and nothing more.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.570
It's a damage containment idea.

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.500
If something were to go wrong, what you
can harm is the set of resources for

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.020
which you hold privileges.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.850
We said people are the weak
link when it comes to security.

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.170
And that is because we perhaps
expect people to do something and

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.820
that doesn't come naturally to them.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.970
Psychological acceptability says don't

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.330
ask people to do that doesn't
put excessive burden on them.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.100
So there are a number of
these design principles.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.770
Actually they come from a classical
paper called design principles for

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:50.990
secure systems.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.320
You'll have a link to that paper.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.020
At least read the design principle
section out of that paper.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:02.000
And for each of these principles we
should understand how does it enhance or

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.530
improve cyber security.
