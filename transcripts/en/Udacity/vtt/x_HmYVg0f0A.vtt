00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The third reason the code might not have been covered is that the test suite might simply

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
just be inadequate, and if the test suite is inadequate, we have to decide what to do about it.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So one option of course is to improve the test suites so that the code gets covered.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The other option is not to worry about it, and of course, since it should in good coverage

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
could be difficult, it can easily be the case that we'll just decide to ship our software

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
without achieving a 100% code coverage, and there is nothing in here to be wrong with that

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
because coverage testing, like all forms of testing, is basically just a cost-benefit tradeoff.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The question we have to ask is are we getting enough value out of

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
doing the testing to offset the cost of doing the testing.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And so if we do ships software with uncovered code, we basically have to do

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
is admit to ourselves that we're perfectly okay with the fact that the customers who are on

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
the receiving end of the software might be the first people who will actually run it.
