00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.330
Right here we have the graph
of y is equal to 250 over 25

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:06.730
plus x squared.

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:08.680
And what I'm curious
about in this video

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.820
is the total area under this
curve and above the x-axis.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.920
So I'm talking about everything
that I'm shading in white here,

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.970
including what we can't see,
as we keep moving to the right

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.690
and we keep moving to the left.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.190
So I'm talking about from
x at negative infinity all

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.700
the way to x at infinity.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.035
So first, how would we
actually denote this?

00:00:30.035 --> 00:00:31.660
Well, it would be an
improper integral.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.630
We would denote this area
as the indefinite integral

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.230
from x is equal to
negative infinity

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.800
to x is equal to
infinity of our function,

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:49.610
250 over 25 plus x squared, dx.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.380
Now, we've already
seen improper integrals

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.104
where one of our
boundaries was infinity.

00:00:54.104 --> 00:00:55.520
But how do you do
it when you have

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.007
one boundary at
positive infinity

00:00:57.007 --> 00:00:58.590
and one boundary at
negative infinity?

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.814
You can't take a limit
to two different things.

00:01:00.814 --> 00:01:02.730
And so the way that we're
going to tackle this

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.170
is to actually
break up this area

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.340
into two different
improper integrals, one

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.760
improper integral that describes
this area right over here

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.810
in blue from negative
infinity to 0.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.840
So we'll say that this is equal
to the improper integral that

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:23.260
goes from negative infinity
to 0 of 250 over 25

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.490
plus x squared dx, plus
the improper integral that

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.090
goes from 0 to
positive infinity.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.840
So plus the improper,
or the definite,

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:41.220
integral from 0 to positive
infinity of 250 over 25

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.830
plus x squared dx.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.920
And now we can start
to make sense of this.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.720
So what we have in
blue can be rewritten.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.060
This is equal to the limit as
n approaches negative infinity

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.480
of the definite integral
from n to 0 of 250 over 25

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.500
plus x squared dx.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.830
Plus-- and I'm running
out of real estate

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.110
here-- the limit as--
since I already used n,

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.980
let me use m now-- the
limit as m approaches

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.560
positive infinity of the
definite integral from 0

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:29.460
to m of 250 over 25
plus x squared dx.

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.500
So now all we have
to do is evaluate

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.910
these definite integrals.

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.660
And to do that, we
just have to figure out

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.050
an antiderivative of 250
over 25 plus x squared.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.280
So let's try to figure
out what that is.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.360
I'll do it over
here on the left.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:51.550
So we need to figure out the
antiderivative of 250 over 25

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.140
plus x squared.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.640
And it might already
jump out at you

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.390
that trig substitution
might be a good thing to do.

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.490
You see this pattern of
a squared plus x squared,

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.400
where in this
case, a would be 5.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.020
So we can make the
substitution that x

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.830
is equal to a tangent
theta, 5 tangent theta.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.650
And since we're going to have
to reverse substitute later on,

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.630
we can also put in
the constraint-- well,

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.610
we'd say x/5 is equal to tangent
of theta, which is completely

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.410
consistent with this
first statement.

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.880
And so if we wanted to
have theta expressed

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.360
as a function of x, we
can put the constraint

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:31.210
that theta is equal
to arctangent of x/5.

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.420
So once again, this is
completely consistent

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.490
with this over here. x
can be 5 tangent of theta,

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:41.020
and theta can be equal
to arctangent of x/5.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.760
So now let's do
the substitution.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.218
Actually, before
that, we also have

00:03:44.218 --> 00:03:45.690
to figure out what
dx is equal to.

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:51.287
So dx is equal to-- I'll do
it right over here-- well,

00:03:51.287 --> 00:03:53.120
the derivative of this
with respect to theta

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.200
is 5 secant squared
theta d theta.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.570
So now we're ready to
substitute back in.

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:07.180
So all of this business is going
to be equal to 250 times dx.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:18.170
Well, 250 times dx is 250 times
5 secant squared theta d theta.

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:21.089
So that's 250 dx is
this business up here.

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:25.605
All of that over
25 plus x squared.

00:04:25.605 --> 00:04:33.470
Well, x squared is going to be
25 tangent squared of theta.

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.930
And now we can try to
simplify all of this business.

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:42.370
This is equal to
250 times 5 secant

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:47.740
squared theta over
25 times 1 plus

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.960
tangent squared theta d theta.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.790
So 25 goes into 250 10 times.

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:59.780
And then 1 plus tangent squared
theta is secant squared theta.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.090
You can prove it for yourself
if you write tan squared theta

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.407
as sine squared theta
over cosine squared theta.

00:05:05.407 --> 00:05:06.990
Add that to 1, which
is the same thing

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.340
as cosine squared theta
over cosine squared theta.

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.350
And then you can use some
basic trig identities

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:18.170
to realize that this is equal
to secant squared theta, which

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:20.230
simplifies our
expression a good bit.

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.780
You get secant squared theta
over secant squared theta,

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:23.990
which is just 1.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.800
And so you're just left with
the 10 times the 5, 50 d theta.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.010
So this is equal
to 50-- I'll take

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:33.460
the 50 outside the
integral-- 50 d theta, which

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.529
is equal to 50 theta.

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:39.070
We can write the
plus C, just to show

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.460
that these are all of
the antiderivatives.

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.090
But we only need the
most basic antiderivative

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.560
to evaluate these
definite integrals.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.020
But we right now only
have it in terms of theta.

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.760
Let's write this in terms of x.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.890
We set the constraint that theta
is equal to arctangent of x/5.

00:05:54.890 --> 00:06:02.800
So this is equal to 50
arctangent of x/5 plus C.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.400
These are all the
antiderivatives.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.620
We can pick C is
equal to 0 to find

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.310
an antiderivative
of these things

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:10.410
to evaluate the
definite integrals.

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:12.030
So let's do that.

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:17.900
So what we have in blue, we
can rewrite as the limit as n

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:23.190
approaches negative infinity
of the antiderivative of this,

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:25.640
or an antiderivative of
this, which we could say

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:32.400
is 50 arctangent of x/5.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.970
And we're going to
evaluate it at 0 and n.

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:41.370
And to this, we're going to
add the limit as m approaches

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:46.000
positive infinity of just
the antiderivative of this,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:55.360
50 arctangent-- not "actangent,"
arctangent-- arctangent of x/5

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:00.050
evaluated from 0 to m.

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:02.450
And let me put a little
parentheses right

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:04.485
around this x/5.

00:07:04.485 --> 00:07:05.610
So what's this going to be?

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.150
This is going to be 50--
so let me write this.

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:11.100
This is going to be the
limit as n approaches

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:16.960
negative infinity of
50 arctangent of 0/5

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:24.810
/ minus 50 arctangent of n/5.

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:32.595
And then to that, we're going
to add-- let me give myself

00:07:32.595 --> 00:07:38.280
even a little bit more space--
the limit as m approaches

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:50.980
infinity of 50 arctan of m/5
minus 50 arctan-- I think

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:55.670
you see where all this is
going-- minus 50 arctan of 0/5.

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:57.520
So now we can
evaluate these things.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.540
And to help us
evaluate them, let's

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:01.074
think about a unit circle.

00:08:01.074 --> 00:08:02.490
So let's think
about a unit circle

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:05.900
so we can really visualize
the arctangent function.

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:08.920
So one way to think
about the tangent

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:12.940
is the slope of the line
that is on the angle

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:16.160
or that helps define the
terminal side of an angle.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.330
So for example, if we have an
angle that looks like this--

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:21.570
this is an angle between
the positive x-axis

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:23.110
and this line right over here.

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:26.540
If we have an angle just like
that, the tangent of that angle

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:29.661
is going to be the
slope of this line.

00:08:29.661 --> 00:08:31.160
And so one way to
think about it is,

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:36.380
OK, if I want the arctangent
of 0, it's essentially saying,

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:42.250
OK, let's get an angle where
the terminal side has slope 0.

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:45.330
Well, an angle where the
terminal side has slope 0

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:46.890
is an angle of 0.

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:50.360
So arctangent of 0 is 0 radians.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.620
So it's 50 times 0.

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:53.065
That's just going to be 0.

00:08:53.065 --> 00:08:54.690
And we could also
write that over here.

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:57.540
This is just going to be 0.

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:03.740
So what we're left
with is the limit

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:06.440
as n approaches
negative infinity

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:19.850
of negative 50 arctangent of n/5
plus the limit as m approaches

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:28.400
positive infinity of
50 arctangent of m/5.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.900
So let's think about what
these are going to be.

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:33.386
So it's the limit as n
approaches negative infinity.

00:09:33.386 --> 00:09:34.760
One way to view
that is the limit

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:37.120
as the slope of
this terminal side

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:38.464
approaches negative infinity.

00:09:38.464 --> 00:09:40.380
So that's getting more
and more negative, more

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:41.544
and more negative.

00:09:41.544 --> 00:09:42.960
It's at negative
infinity, or it's

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:48.080
approaching negative infinity
when our angle right over here

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.480
is negative pi/2 radians.

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:59.850
Or you could say the
limit of arctan of n/5

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:02.270
as n approaches negative
infinity, this part

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:04.590
right over here, is
going to approach,

00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:06.360
as n approaches
negative infinity,

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.069
it's going to be negative pi/2.

00:10:08.069 --> 00:10:09.610
And then we're just
going to multiply

00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:11.730
that times the negative 50.

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:18.740
So this is going to be negative
50 times negative pi/2, which

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:21.020
is going to be positive 25 pi.

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:24.460
So this is going to be 25 pi.

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:28.400
And similarly,
arctan of m/5 as m

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:31.279
approaches infinity-- well,
as m approaches infinity,

00:10:31.279 --> 00:10:33.070
the slope of the terminal
side of the angle

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:34.100
approaches infinity.

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.240
So the slope is
getting higher, higher.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.950
It approaches infinity as
it gets closer and closer

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:40.010
to vertical.

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:43.080
So the arctan of
m/5 as m approaches

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.870
infinity is going
to be positive pi/2.

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:49.324
This is an angle
of positive pi/2.

00:10:49.324 --> 00:10:50.990
So what we see in
orange right over here

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:54.810
is going to be
positive 50 times pi/2,

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:58.220
which is going to be 25 pi.

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:00.770
So the area that
we have in blue,

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:06.280
going back to our original
problem, is 25 pi.

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:10.144
The area that we have
in orange is 25 pi.

00:11:10.144 --> 00:11:12.310
And so if we wanted to
answer our original question,

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:14.226
what's the total area
under this curve-- which

00:11:14.226 --> 00:11:17.110
is kind of a cool
question to try

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:24.680
to answer-- we get it's 25 pi
plus 25 pi, which is 50 pi.

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.550
And we're done.
