spends more time going through those
 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.570
spends more time going through those
menus you've actually created more work

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580
menus you've actually created more work
 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.480

rather than less you've externalized the

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490
rather than less you've externalized the
 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.719

everybody else so then what do they do

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680
everybody else so then what do they do
 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.710
everybody else so then what do they do
well now they all have to get computer

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720
well now they all have to get computer
 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.600
well now they all have to get computer
operators because they have to

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610
operators because they have to
 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.490

externalise the cost to everybody else

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500
externalise the cost to everybody else
 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.280
externalise the cost to everybody else
so we all end up now spending more time

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290
so we all end up now spending more time
 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.940
so we all end up now spending more time
and energy going through those though

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950

can show that it's hired less people we
 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:17.440
can show that it's hired less people we
end up perpetuating that system

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450
end up perpetuating that system
 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.080
