Max sometimes gets
treated like a zero,

but deep down he knows
he's a superhero.

the Politics and Prose shop,

and then have it signed between
2:30 and 3:30 p.m. Let's learn more

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.130
about Max and how we can all
become the superheroes we've

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.770
and I'm going to take
questions from the audience.

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:19.960
In the meantime, Nikki is going to
be back here at her sketch board

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.920
and she's going to be dorkifying
members of the audience.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.740
Do you guys want to know
what a dorkification is?

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.340

loud, what is it?

Yes, she's going to be drawing
random members of the audience.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.720
And right before we finish up,
she's going to show her drawings,

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.750
and then we'll have to figure
out which of you people she drew.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.050
So that's going to be a lot of fun.

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.980
That's what we'll do, like,
the last ten minutes or so.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.620
So let's get started.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.370
Nikki, you'll get busy.

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.150
I'm really happy to be here today.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.480
And actually, being an author
is a dream come true for me.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.620
I'm originally by trade an attorney

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.190
and actually a consumer
bankruptcy attorney.

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.320
So in my other life if you had a
lot of financial problems and a lot

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.540
of debt or if you had a
disaster that happened to you,

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:25.710
be it sometimes a divorce or
medical issues and you were

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.980
in the situation financially where
you couldn't pay your bills, well,

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.410
you would hire me and I
would make them go away.

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:37.500
But I do enjoy being
an author much better.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.070
It's a lot of fun and
I get to work at home.

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.670
I get to work with
my daughter, Nikki.

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.250
And then I have a second daughter,

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.760
her name is Erin, and
she helps write.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:52.150
So this whole adventure is
a dream come true for me.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:53.940
So do we have a microphone
in the audience

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.540
where I could take questions?

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.080
The microphone is -- and one here?

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.390
Okay. Okay, we'll go
with the young lady

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.230
&gt;&gt; On your <i>Dork Diaries</i> page,
you say you're going to come

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.530
out with a movie; when is
that going to come out?

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.800
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell: Okay,
the <i>Dork Diaries</i> movie.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:29.010
That -- okay, our film rights
were optioned by Lionsgate Films.

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.520
And you've all heard of
Lionsgate, I imagine.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.360
They are the famous studio
behind <i>The Hunger Games</i>,

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.340
and <i>Twilight</i>, and <i>Divergent</i>.

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.970
Well, they did, in fact,
option our movie rights.

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:47.310
But unfortunately and
sadly, there is not going

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.910
to be a <i>Dork Diaries</i>
movie [Laughs].

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:52.930
Now, I could talk about
this for the next hour,

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.910
but I'll just spend maybe a few
minutes discussing it a little bit.

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:58.650
And, again, I'm very disappointed.

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.960
I'm sure you guys are disappointed.

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.400
As you heard, <i>Dork Diaries</i>
has sold over 30 million books,

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:11.920
we've been translated
into 37 languages,

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:16.400
but apparently Lionsgate feels that
in spite of all that popularity

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.160
around the world, nobody will
turn out to see the movie.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.830
I was told that they did research
and based on their research,

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.440
they felt that our fans
and families, you know,

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.960
would not be interested
in seeing the movie.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.250
So that was the first reason why
there's not a <i>Dork Diaries</i> movie.

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:39.940
I feel that you people here --

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:45.980
and again, there's girls 8 to 14
years old and boys 8 to 14 years --

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:47.910
deserve to see themselves
in movie theatres.

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:51.510
If you agree with that, let
me hear you clap your hands.

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:54.830
[ Applause ]

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:56.890
Yeah, I agree, too.

00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:01.000
Now, the older kids kind of
get all the fun and excitement.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.100
Lionsgate has made movies and
have done a really good job --

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:06.580
I'll give them credit
where credit is due --

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:11.050
they've done a wonderful job
making movies for teen girls.

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:15.120
And teen girls would, I would say,
probably be 16 to 18 years old.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:20.030
They've done <i>Twilight</i>, and
<i>Hunger Games</i>, and whatever.

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:24.240
They've done actually a pretty good
job covering the young boys here.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.220
They've released a couple
of movies for the 18-

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:30.850 position:56%
to 14-year-old demographic for boys.

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:35.100
But when it comes to girls
there's been a problem.

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:36.400
That's why the whole thing

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.730
with <i>Dork Diaries</i> has
been so disappointing.

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:42.360
The last movie that Lionsgate
has made that featured an 8-

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:45.420
to 14-year-old girl,
like a lot of you here,

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:50.770
was in 2006 -- that
was 11 years ago.

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:55.680
Some of you probably weren't
even alive 11 years ago.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:59.490
But they did release a movie, and
it was called <i>Akeelah and the Bee</i>.

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:01.090
How many of you have
heard of that movie?

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:03.050
Yeah, that's a good movie.

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:05.160
And it features an
African-American little girl, too,

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.610
so I'm really happy about that.

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:10.230
But the last full release
-- when I say full release,

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:13.930 position:56%
movie that's been put in the
theatres and stayed there, you know,

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:17.040
for several weeks or several
months, not a limited release;

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:20.390 position:56%
a limited release is a movie that
goes into the theatres for one week,

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:24.230
then they pull it, usually
convert to a DVD, and then sell it

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:28.690
in stores -- so the last full
release that Lionsgate has made

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:32.960
for you people here, especially
the girls, was in 2006,

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.320
and that was <i>Akeelah and the Bee</i>.

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:39.990 position:56%
And that movie did feature a main
character that was in that age range

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:42.900
that you guys are in,
which is 8 to 14.

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:47.820
So -- so what do I want?

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:50.180
You guys are sorry you asked a
question about the movie, huh?

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:51.480
Because I'm going on and on and on.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.190
But it's just -- I'm
really passionate about it,

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:56.810
and this is something
I wanted to see happen.

00:08:56.810 --> 00:09:00.760
My message to Lionsgate is that
they are not going to lead the way

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:05.790
in getting movies made for your
demographic and you people here,

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:09.510
they're not going to lead the way,
they need to get out of the way.

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:14.180
[ Applause ]

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:18.820
You should not have to wait another
11 years to get another <i>Akeelah</i>

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:21.680
<i>and the Bee</i> or any type of movie

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:25.300
that features girls
in your age range.

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:29.630
Now, I'm not up here whining and
moaning because there's not going

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:31.170
to be a <i>Dork Diaries</i> movie.

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:34.360
If Lionsgate does not want to
make a <i>Dork Diaries</i> movie, fine.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:37.940
I'm fine with that
because it will get made.

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:40.830
There are a lot of people that
would be interested in that.

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:44.500
But what I don't want -- if they're
not going to make the movie, fine.

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:45.800
They can return the movie rights,

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:48.450
and we'll find somebody that's
really excited about it.

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:52.810
I do not want to be packaged
into a cheap digital TV show

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:55.300
because you deserve to see
yourselves in movie theatres.

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:59.440
I do not want to be a limited
release, which means it's

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:03.340
in the theatres for one week
and then packaged into a DVD.

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:05.610
And, again, if they're not
interested in the movie,

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:08.640
which is what we signed up
for, then they're not going

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.500
to lead the way, then
get out of the way.

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:14.590 position:56%
Give us our movie rights back and we
will get a movie made for you guys.

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:16.010

a lot of research on this issue.

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:28.190
With all the things that are going
on in the world today, you know,

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:31.830
now I have to worry about, you
know, my fans being able to go

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:34.130
to a movie theatre
and see themselves.

gender in the media.

And it's just a little

but you wouldn't know it
by watching kids media.

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:27.270
On screen Jane is outnumbered
by a ratio of three-to-one.

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:30.570
When she is there, a lot of
time it's purely as eye candy.

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:22.670
So that's my message to
girls especially and boys,

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:24.650
if you can see it, you can be it.

And that's why it's important to get
movies in theatres that reflect all

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.680
of the American population.

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:35.950
So let's get back to
questions again.

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:37.250
Yes?

00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:40.330
&gt;&gt; Who inspired you to
write about Nikki Maxwell?

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:41.630
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell:
Who inspired me

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:42.930
to write about Nikki Maxwell?

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:46.030
My two daughters are very
dorky and they were very dorky

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:48.620
in grade school and
in middle school.

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:51.300
And they'd come home with
all types of stories.

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:53.960
Sometimes they'd have good days
and sometimes they'd have bad days.

00:12:53.960 --> 00:13:00.470
But when I decided to write a
book, I decided to write something

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:06.210
that would be a little different
and that would inspire other kids

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:07.510
that were dorky like them

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:10.720
and possibly having a
hard time at school.

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:14.380
So as you can see, Nikki grew up
to be a very smart young lady.

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:16.780
Actually by trade, she's an
elementary school teacher.

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:19.510
She taught second and third grade.

[ Applause ]

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:27.370
So my inspiration for <i>Dork
Diaries</i> are my two dorky daughters,

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:28.670
Erin and Nikki.

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:30.300
Let's go over here.

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:32.600
&gt;&gt; Um.

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:36.210
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell: Yes?

00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:41.230
&gt;&gt; Why did you make the
stories of Max Crumbly?

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:43.380
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell: I made
<i>The Misadventures of Max Crumbly</i>

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:47.330 position:56%
because whenever we would go out
and do book signings, we'd have lots

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:50.150
of guys who were big
<i>Dork Diaries</i> fans,

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:52.990
but inevitably they'd always say,
"Well, why don't you make a book

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:55.010
with a guy main character?"

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:58.530
So I was inspired to make <i>The
Misadventures of Max Crumbly</i>

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:02.650
for all of my guy <i>Dork Diaries</i>
fans who kept asking me over

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:06.210
and over and over to
write another book series

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:09.300
that had a guy as a main character.

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:11.600
Yes?

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:17.720
&gt;&gt; What's your favorite
book in the series?

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.150
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell:
My favorite book

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:25.310 position:56%
in the series is always book one and
the newest book that I'm working on.

00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:29.520
So we just finished <i>Dork Diaries</i>
book 12 probably about a month ago.

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:32.320
So right now my favorite
book is <i>Dork Diaries</i> book 1

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:33.790
and <i>Dork Diaries</i> book 12.

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:36.800
We'll be starting <i>Dork Diaries</i>
book 13 in probably a couple

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:38.970
of weeks, and then more than
likely that's going to end

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:41.960
up being my favorite book as well.

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:49.420
&gt;&gt; What made you decide to have Max
as the prey and not the predator?

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:52.550
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell: Oh,
that's a very good question.

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:57.580
So probably again,
raising my daughters.

00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:01.440
And they were the prey
and not the predator.

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:05.210
So as a mom, when they would come
home and they'd be having problems,

00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:07.780
I thought, "Well, what am
I doing wrong as a parent?

00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:10.890
Maybe if I was a better mother
or if I was more supportive."

00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:12.350
But it's not about that.

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:16.450
There are just children that
Erin and Nikki ran into and a lot

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:20.720
of you will run into, and
they have the issues --

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:22.830
it's not you, or your
parents, or your family.

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:26.040
They'll try to make you
think it's you, but no,

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:29.970
it's other people have personal
problems in some instances,

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:32.770
and then they take out
their frustrations on you.

00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:38.390
So only because I can relate
to a person being bullied more

00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:41.800
so than ably, I wrote it
from that perspective.

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.450
But that's a very good question.

00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:44.750
Yes?

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:50.000
&gt;&gt; When were you planning to have
the next Max Crumbly book come out?

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.430
&gt;&gt; The newest Max Crumbly book,
and that was the <i>The Misadventures</i>

00:15:53.430 --> 00:16:00.840
<i>of Max Crumbly: Middle School
Mayhem</i>, came out just in June.

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:02.630
So it was released a
couple of months ago.

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:05.220
I'm going to see if I
can find it on here.

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:09.470
Ah, let's go this way.

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:15.340
Oops, did I miss it up?

00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:19.580
Well, anyway, I was going
to show you the cover.

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:23.010
But anyway, Max Crumbly -- yeah,
you guys, they're holding it up.

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:25.590
It's the black book with
the silver spiral on it.

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:28.710
That was just released
in June of 2017.

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:31.440
Our next Max Crumbly books
will be coming out more

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:34.450
than likely in June of 2018.

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:37.920 position:56%
Okay. We'll take two more questions,
and then Nikki's going to be ready.

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:40.610
Okay. We're over here, I think.

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:47.680
&gt;&gt; Why did you make one of the
perspectives from the diary instead

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:50.580
of just from, like, a
third person point of view?

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:53.500
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell: I
love writing from the diary

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:54.800
or first person perspective

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.280
because that way you can
get into the writer's head.

00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:02.810
If they're feeling happy or sad or
angry in first person which is kind

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:07.870
of the diary perspective,
you can really relate

00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:09.870
to how the person is feeling.

00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:11.350
So -- and then diaries are cool.

00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:13.620
And it's always fun to
sneak and read a diary.

00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:18.170
So I thought that would be a fun
angle to approach the book from.

00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:20.480
And our last question?

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:22.270
&gt;&gt; How long does it take to you

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:27.160
like do the illustrations
and, like, write it?

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:28.870
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell: We write

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:31.010
and illustrate the
book at the same time.

00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:33.670
In some cases I'll write a chapter,

00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:35.300
and then I'll give it
to Nikki to illustrate.

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:37.050
And then once I've
seen the illustrations,

00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:41.470
it usually blows my mind and I
go back and rewrite the chapter.

00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:43.290
So we kind of do them
both at the same time.

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:46.110
And I would say it takes
probably about four

00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:49.080
to five months to do
a complete book.

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:51.470
So that's it for our questions.

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:53.290
And Nikki, are you ready?

00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:55.080
Well, she has one more.

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:57.490
You want to finish that up quickly?

00:17:57.490 --> 00:18:02.020
Maybe we'll take one more question
while she's finishing things up.

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:08.640
&gt;&gt; Are you ever thinking about
making a book about Brandon?

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:11.140
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell: That
would be very cool to do.

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:13.400
So yes, I am thinking about that.

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:15.700
Definitely.

00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:21.910
Yes?

00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:26.890
&gt;&gt; How did your daughter
Nikki get so good at drawing?

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:28.380
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell:
That's a really good question,

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:31.040
and I'm always excited
to talk about that.

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:34.690
Nikki started out taking
black markers

00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:39.870
and writing all over
her bedroom walls.

00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:41.680
Don't try this at home.

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:45.210
But she loved drawing and sketching
so much that when she was, like,

00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:50.530
four, she had the nastiest
habit of drawing on walls.

00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:53.960
And when they were newly-painted,
they were her favorite.

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:58.120
So after that, when she got a
little older, probably about seven

00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:01.980
or eight years old, I
put her in a summer camp.

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:05.080
And it was for -- we're originally
from Grand Rapids, Michigan.

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:07.660
And it was called Kendall
School of Art and Design,

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:09.370 position:56%
and they ran a summer camp for kids.

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:13.930
And Nikki went to that summer
camp from 8 years old all the way

00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:17.380
up to her senior year in high
school, which is 18 years old.

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:21.100
That's all the training she's had.

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:22.400
So what's the message?

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:25.380
The message is you can
become brilliant at anything

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:28.660
that you dream to do
as a young person.

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:32.110
Nikki's skills did not come
from college or, you know,

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:33.410
what she's done as adult,

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:37.780
it all came from her summer
art camps from age 8 to 18.

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:41.900
And if she can do it, all of
you guys can do it as well.

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:43.700
So I think she's ready.

00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:57.740
If you're a big <i>Max Crumbly</i>
fan, we would like to inspire you

00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:02.440
to be the hero you
always dreamed of;

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:04.350
and if you're a big
<i>Dork Diaries</i> fan,

00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:08.160
we always say let your
inner dork shine through.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.960
Take care.
