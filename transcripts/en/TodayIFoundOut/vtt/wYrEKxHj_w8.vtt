00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:16.860
The Tunguska Event

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:22.670
The Tunguska event occurred around 7:00 a.m.
local time on June 30, 1908 near the Podkamennaya

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.430
Tunguska River in Siberia.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.949
Witnesses saw a “blue-ish light, nearly
as bright as the Sun, moving across the sky.”

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:35.050
What followed was an estimated 15 megaton
explosion which knocked over about 80 million

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:41.210
trees in about a 1300 square mile area, forming
a butterfly shape pattern.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.030
This also sent a shock wave throughout parts
of Europe and Asia, registering as far away

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.989
as England (about 4000 miles away).

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:47.989
Further, the atmospheric pressure change was
also significant enough to be measured all

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:48.989
the way in Great Britain.

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.560
Another interesting side effect of this blast
was that, for several days after the blast

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.369
throughout most of Asia and Europe, the night
sky glowed.

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:58.070
It was so bright that people as far away as
China reportedly were able to read in the

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.820
middle of the night by nothing but the glow
of the sky.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.150
For a firsthand account, here is the testimony
of one S. Semenov, who was about 40 miles

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.150
from ground zero:

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.159
“At breakfast time I was sitting by the
house at Vanavara Trading Post (65 km from

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:14.030
the epicenter), facing north…

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.220
I suddenly saw that directly to the north,
over Onkoul’s Tunguska Road, the sky split

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.360
in two and fire appeared high and wide over
the forest.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.479
The split in the sky grew larger, and the
entire northern side was covered with fire.

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.971
At that moment, I became so hot that I couldn’t
bear it, as if my shirt was on fire; from

00:01:30.971 --> 00:01:34.310
the northern side, where the fire was, came
strong heat.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.650
I wanted to tear off my shirt and throw it
down, but then the sky shut closed, and a

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.420
strong thump sounded, and I was thrown a few
meters.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.619
I lost my senses for a moment, but then my
wife ran out and led me to the house.

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.770
After that such noise came, as if rocks were
falling or cannons were firing, the earth

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.259
shook, and when I was on the ground, I pressed
my head down, fearing rocks would smash it.

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:02.049
When the sky opened up, hot wind raced between
the houses, like from cannons, which left

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:06.310
traces in the ground like pathways, and it
damaged some crops.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.780
Later we saw that many windows were shattered,
and in the barn a part of the iron lock snapped.”

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.080
So what caused this massive blast?

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.680
For a long time, it wasn’t precisely known.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.180
When the event first happened, it drew little
interest largely because it happened in a

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.170
very remote part of the world.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.760
It wasn’t until some 19 years later that
Leonid Kulik, a Russian mineralogist, decided

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.880
to go investigate, figuring that a massive
meteorite must have hit the Earth.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.540
Kulik and his team had little trouble locating
ground zero of the blast, despite it being

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.849
19 years later, due to the fact that the “trees
acted as markers, pointing directly away from

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:42.360
the blast’s epicenter”.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.790
However, once they got to the epicenter, they
found a curious thing.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.400
There was no crater, as they had expected,
and the trees were still standing in about

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.010
a 3 mile radius circle at the center, but
with their limbs, bark, leaves, etc. all completely

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.010
stripped.

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.549
So essentially, all these trees were just
giant poles in the ground with all the other

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.379
trees for miles and miles around blasted to
the ground.

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:04.079
For a long time, there was much debate over
exactly what caused this, but today scientists

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:07.410
are reasonably certain it was a comet, rather
than an asteroid (see the difference between

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.519
a comet and an asteroid) or other naturally
occurring event.

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:14.879
The comet must have been around 30-40 meters
across (around 120 feet) and must have been

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:21.329
traveling around 30,000-40,000 mph (about
55,000-65,000 km/h).

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:26.060
As it traveled through the atmosphere, the
air around it heated up to as much as 50,000

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:32.090
degrees Fahrenheit (about 28,000 degrees Celsius)
causing the comet to look like a giant fireball

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.829
streaking through the sky.

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:38.549
Eventually, this also caused the comet to
annihilate itself around 5 miles (8 km) above

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:43.189
the Earth’s surface in a fiery blast that
consumed the comet, which was largely made

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:44.189
of ice.

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:49.299
Thus, you get a massive explosion, but no
impact crater or much of any apparent evidence

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:54.829
of what caused the explosion, unless you witness
it or start taking very careful soil samples

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:58.069
and the like.

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:03.329
It wasn’t until nuclear testing that these
same blast patterns would be observed again,

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:08.010
including the stripping of trees around ground
zero with the other trees being blasted down.

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.650
What’ happening here is the shock wave travels
so fast that there is insufficient time for

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.109
the branches to transfer the force to the
main part of the tree before they are ripped

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:18.109
off.

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.210
For those trees in the epicenter, the force
is all downward, so the result is simply that

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.289
the branches and bark all get stripped, but
the trees remain standing.

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:30.460
Outside of the epicenter, the shock-wave hits
the trees at more of a horizontal angle, so

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:31.820
it flattens them.

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.860
Eventually, Soviet experimenters were able
to even mimic the butterfly blast pattern

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.039
with a model forest and small charges.

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:42.139
From this, they discovered that the blast
must have occurred with the blasting body

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:48.580
approaching at around a 30 degree angle from
the ground and 115 degrees from North.

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:54.270
It’s estimated that a Tunguska sized comet
or asteroid should hit the Earth’s atmosphere

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.580
about once every 300 years.

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.590
The blast from it is more than sufficient
to wipe out even the largest city on Earth,

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.020
should it happen to blow up or strike around
a major city.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:09.150
A comet or asteroid about 1/3 of the size
of the Tunguska comet hits the Earth’s atmosphere

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:14.560
about one or more times per year and produces
a blast of around 20 kilotons, which is about

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.280
equivalent to the nuclear bomb dropped on
Nagasaki.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.900
Luckily, these tend to annihilate themselves
quite high in the atmosphere.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.740
In order to get the Soviet government to pay
for his expedition to go investigate this

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.759
blast, Kulik convinced them that it must have
been a meteorite and that meteorite would

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:35.970
have been massive and made mostly of iron,
so there was great potential for a huge supply

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:41.419
of easily minable iron available that the
Soviet’s could use.

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:45.630
The U.S. built a nuclear bomb that was roughly
equivalent to the Tunguska comet, in terms

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.710
of blast power, being rated at around 15 megatons.

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:53.720
This nuclear bomb was named Castle Bravo and
was detonated on March 1, 1954.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:59.160
The Tsar Bomba (see video showing the detonation
below), the largest nuclear bomb ever detonated,

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.470
had a yield of around 50 megatons.

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:06.449
Originally, it was designed to have a yield
of 100 megatons, but was reduced due to concerns

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:07.970
over nuclear fallout.

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:11.960
Not only was it the largest nuclear bomb detonated,
but it was also one of the cleanest, relative

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.800
to the TNT equivalent output.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.680
It was detonated on October 30, 1961.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:22.280
The Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs, on the other
hand, were very small compared to the Tsar

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.129
Bomba and were not that efficient.

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:30.479
The Hiroshima bomb was estimated at about
only 13 kilotons of TNT (1/3800th the size

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:36.919
of the Tsar Bomba) with the total blast destructive
zone only being about one mile in radius.

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:41.910
Including resulting fires, it destroyed about
5 square miles of the city or about 69% of

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:48.310
the buildings, killing 70,000 people upon
detonation with an additional 70,000 seriously

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:49.310
injured.

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:54.230
Around 90% of all medical staff and facilities
were destroyed in the explosion itself; that,

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:58.670
combined with the effects of radiation burns
and sickness, contributed to about an additional

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:04.370
150,000 people dead at various points thanks
to the blast, though many survived for years

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:09.110
to come before succumbing to cancer and other
such sicknesses brought on by heavy ionizing

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:10.680
radiation exposure.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:15.240
Nagasaki, on the other hand, had significantly
less casualties, partially due to the fact

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:19.229
that conventional bombs were dropped on it
before hand, so many of the people, particularly

00:07:19.229 --> 00:07:23.379
school aged children, were evacuated from
the city by the time the nuclear bomb was

00:07:23.379 --> 00:07:24.379
dropped.

00:07:24.379 --> 00:07:29.410
This explosion was 21 kilotons, with casualties
reaching a still staggering number of around

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:46.900
40,000 people instantly, with around triple
that number estimated overall.
