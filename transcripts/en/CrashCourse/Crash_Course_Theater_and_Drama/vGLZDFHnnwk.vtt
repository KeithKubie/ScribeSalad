Hey there, I’m Mike Rugnetta. This is Crash
Course Theater, and today—[[[Yorick zooms

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.490
in with a placard reading “Strike! Strike!
Strike!”]]]—we’re discussing theater

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.160
in 1930s America. Don’t cross any picket
lines, ya boney scab.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.550
The 1930s was a fine decade if you’re into
worldwide economic collapse. It was also pretty

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.960
great for theater. Go figure! We’ll be looking
at the Group Theater, a hugely influential

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.240
collective that tried to bring Stanislavski’s
theories to America.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.070
And then we’ll turn to the Federal Theater
Project, a Works Progress Administration scheme

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.200
that employed thousands of out-of-work theater
professionals—even Orson Welles—and created

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:45.730
full-length plays about...farming. And syphilis.
Let’s rock that cradle. Lights up!

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:52.140
INTRO
The Group Theater was founded in New York

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.830
in 1931 by Lee Strasberg, Cheryl Crawford,
and Harold Clurman—three kids with guts,

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.620
hearts, and a pretty all-encompassing interest
in creating a socially conscious, politically

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.540
motivated theater embodied in a naturalistic
style of acting that felt right for modern

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.840
life. Modern in 1931, at least.
Here’s how Clurman put it: “Our interest

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.710
in the life of our times must lead us to the
discovery of those methods that would most

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.770
truly convey this life through the theatre.”
They wanted to form an ensemble as unified

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.140
and skilled as the one Konstantin Stanislavski
had created at the Moscow Art Theater. Because

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.219
they were superfans of the Moscow Art Theater.
So in 1931, they convinced the Theater Guild

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:37.450
to give them $1000 and permission to rehearse
a new play in Connecticut. They gathered up

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.530
28 actors and got to work, calling themselves
the Group.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.959
They rehearsed Paul Green’s “The House
of Connelly,” a tale of a romance on a plantation.

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:51.359
Green was one of those white writers who won
prizes for writing in black dialect, while

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:55.249
black theater struggled to prove its legitimacy
on the world stage.

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:59.340
The Theater Guild said they’d fund it if
the Group fired a couple of their actors and

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.520
restored the original downer murder ending.
The Group said no—collectively!—and Eugene

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.690
O’Neill stepped in with a little cash.
The play was a critical success, but not a

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.099
big financial success, because the Group was
too idealistic to care about box office. That

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:20.500
would eventually become… a problem. Listen,
I know that y’all wanna do it for the art–but

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.770
take it from an actual theater professional
(me): sometimes you gotta do it for the money,

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.620
IN ORDER to do it for the art. I know it’s
tough.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.790
Rehearsing the play meant drilling actors
in the Stanislavski system. Or at least the

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.430
Stanislavski system as Strasberg understood
it. This is what we now call the method or

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.010
method acting. So if you’re an actor who
has ever felt that you have to torture yourself

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.519
in service of a role, or access some really,
really dark memories, you can thank those

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:53.780
guys! Affective memory or emotion memory is
what Strasberg taught, and it goes a long

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.040
way to explaining intense actors like Marlon
Brando, or Daniel Day Lewis.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.580
In 1934, Clurman and his wife Stella Adler
actually met and worked with Stanislavski.

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:08.569
And they came back to tell everyone that Strasberg
had it all wrong. Stanislavski wasn’t interested

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:13.519
in feelings; he was interested in actions
and circumstances. This led to a pretty epic

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:18.370
fight between Adler and Strasberg—a feud
that lasted sixty years—and to Strasberg

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.030
taking a reduced role within the company.
The Group Theater dissolved in 1940. The company

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:29.010
was smart about a lot of things, but money
wasn’t really one of them. They produced

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.650
their non-commercial plays in big, commercial
Broadway theaters, and funding was a strain.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.689
Also, they had trouble figuring out a workable
power structure.

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:40.180
You might be shocked to learn that there’s
a lot of ego in theater.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.959
Still it’s hard to overstate the influence
of the Group on American playwriting, acting,

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.569
and directing. Keep in mind, as we talk about
their plays, that most of the most famous

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:54.340
acting teachers in America—including Strasberg,
Adler, Sanford Meisner, and Bobby Lewis—all

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.890
worked for the Group. Elia Kazan, Crawford,
and Lewis would later go on to found the Actors

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.970
Studio, who trained pretty much everyone.
Not all of the Group Theater’s plays were

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.909
strictly realistic, but the company helped
to further a distinctly American naturalism

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:15.170
that depended on big conflict and big emotion.
Many of these plays were idealistic or at

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:21.030
least interested in questions of idealism,
encouraging a yea-saying rather than a nay-saying

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:27.850
view of humanity. “Every good play is propaganda
for a better life,” Clurman said.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.580
An early hit was John Howard Lawson’s “Success
Story,” about an ad man who risks losing

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:38.190
his soul as he climbs the corporate ladder.
And the Group had a rare financial success

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.210
with Sidney Kingsley’s Pulitzer Prize winning
“Men in White,” a story of heroic doctors

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.479
and their coats at a New York City hospital.

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:49.850
But the playwright most indelibly associated
with the Group is Clifford Odets. Odets had

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:55.009
joined the Group as an actor, and he’d been
begging them for years to stage one of his

00:04:55.009 --> 00:05:00.080
plays. And the Group was like, ha ha—no.
And Odets was like, no you guys, it’s “Awake

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.319
and Sing!” Come on! And the group was like,
ha ha ha—still no.

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:07.599
Another company staged his play “Waiting
for Lefty” in a benefit performance, and

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:13.530
it was a huge hit. The Group was finally like,
“Cliff, baby—let’s do some shows!”

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:19.750
Odets’s plays are talky, scrappy, heartbreak-y
dramas of the American immigrant experience.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.130
Conflicts typically arise from the tension
between tradition and family, and what character’s

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:29.280
feel they owe to themselves. As the grandfather
in “Awake and Sing!” says to his grandson:

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:34.930
“Wake up! Be something! Make your life something
good. For the love of an old man who sees

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:41.110
in your young days his new life, for such
love - take the world in your two hands and

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.220
make it like new.”
Odets’s characters speak in contemporary,

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:50.440
dialect-driven speech. But this ordinary language
can soar into a kind of poetry when the characters

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.950
are moved—sometimes by desire, sometimes
by oppression.

00:05:53.950 --> 00:06:00.289
“Waiting for Lefty,” had its historic
premiere on January 6, 1935. Is it theater?

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:06.650
Or propaganda? Yes! Help us out, ThoughtBubble:
The play is based on an actual forty-day strike

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:13.290
among New York cab drivers in 1934. They were
hoping for fairer contracts. As it begins,

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:18.110
a corrupt union boss is trying to convince
the drivers not to strike. The drivers are

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:22.550
waiting for their chairman, Lefty. This was
before “Godot,” when you could still wait

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:27.379
for stuff and not have it seem derivative.
The audience is positioned as other drivers

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:30.889
at the meeting, and often they’re addressed
directly.

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:35.990
Joe, one of the drivers, gets up to speak,
and the scene shifts to Joe’s apartment,

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:37.210
the week before.

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:41.660
His furniture is being repossessed, and his
family doesn’t have enough money for groceries.

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:46.900
But even though they’re struggling, his
wife tells him to stand up and strike.

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:51.780
In other vignettes, other characters resist
oppression. A lab assistant refuses to spy

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:57.060
on his boss and punches out the company’s
owner. A young driver tries to hold on to

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:02.240
his girlfriend, though her family disapproves.
A Jewish doctor is discriminated against and

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.319
then radicalized.
Back at the meeting, one man, a veteran of

00:07:05.319 --> 00:07:11.780
another strike, tries to discourage the workers,
but he’s outed as a company spy. Then, another

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:17.200
man runs in and tells everyone that Lefty
has been shot dead, presumably by the taxi

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:23.180
bigwigs. An organizer turns to the audience
and asks, “Well, what’s the answer?”

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.770
On opening night, a few of the stagehands
shouted, “Strike!”

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:30.909
The audience started shouting it, too! When
the play finished, they were so moved that

00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:37.260
they stood up and clapped and stamped for
forty five minutes, through twenty six curtain

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:43.160
calls, until they were removed from the theater.
And then they kept it up on the street outside.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:48.050
—Strike! Strike! Thanks, ThoughtBubble.
That was inspiring. Eventually, Odets left

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:52.900
New York, lured to Hollywood, where he wrote
a bunch of excellent screenplays. But he eventually

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:58.449
returned with plays that took a dark view
of corrupting Hollywood power structures,

00:07:58.449 --> 00:08:01.710
and his new Broadway works said so. So, bite
that hand, Cliff!

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:06.550
If the Group Theater was a small, fervent,
wildly influential response to the Great Depression,

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:11.960
there was an even bigger one in the works—the
Federal Theater Project. The FTP, which kicked

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:17.400
off in 1935, was a New Deal initiative meant
to keep theater professionals working until

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:24.160
the economy improved. Eventually, it employed
more than fifteen thousand people across forty

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.620
states.
To head the FTP, the politicians didn’t

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:32.409
look to famous Broadway directors and producers.
Instead they chose Hallie Flanagan, a Vassar

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:36.730
professor. And this was a baller move—because
like a lot of academics—Flanagan liked plays

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:40.300
that fell solidly in the weird and awesome
range.

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:45.200
Instead of programming feel-good comedies
or Shakespeare, followed by Shakespeare, with

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:50.500
a dollop of Shakespeare, she created a network
of regional theaters and encouraged them to

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:55.620
make weird, awesome work. BUT ok there were
some classic plays, too.

00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:00.430
In its four years, the FTP-sponsored hundreds
of distinct productions, most of them open

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:06.430
to the public with free admission. The FTP
was not expected or required to turn a profit…

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:10.339
and no one had any money anway!
Susan Glaspell, whom you’ll maybe remember

00:09:10.339 --> 00:09:15.650
from our episode on American moderns, headed
the Midwest bureau. Not a trifle! The expressionist

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:18.330
playwright Elmer Rice headed up the New York
office.

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:23.959
The FTP also created units of the Negro Theater
Project in 23 cities. The New York Unit was

00:09:23.959 --> 00:09:28.011
originally headed by two white directors,
John Houseman and Orson Welles, though they

00:09:28.011 --> 00:09:31.750
were replaced a year later by three black
directors: Edward Perry, Carlton Moss, and

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:37.970
H. F. V. Edward. The most famous project was
probably the twenty-year-old Welles’s wildly

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:43.709
popular “voodoo” “Macbeth,” which
cast entirely black actors and reset the tragedy

00:09:43.709 --> 00:09:46.730
in the Caribbean.
The FTP is probably best remembered for creating

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:51.890
the Living Newspapers: plays by journalists
and theater makers that were drawn from the

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:57.010
news of the day; current events presented
in a form inspired by vaudeville, pageant,

00:09:57.010 --> 00:10:02.200
and newer, more experimental forms.
As Flanagan wrote, they were designed to “dramatize

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:07.959
a new struggle—the search of the average
American today for knowledge about his country

00:10:07.959 --> 00:10:13.110
and his world; to dramatize his struggle to
turn the great natural and economic forces

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:16.750
of our time toward a better life for more
people.”

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:21.540
The first play, “Ethiopia,” wasn’t allowed
to open. The government issued a censorship

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:27.690
order saying current heads of state couldn’t
be imitated onstage. Man, good thing we got

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:31.100
over that anxiety, huh?!
“Triple A Plowed Under” explored the rights

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:35.570
of farmers. “One-Third of a Nation” was
about a housing crisis. “Spirochete” was

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:41.170
a fun play starring syphilis. Often these
plays were narrated by a “little man.”

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:47.519
[[[Yorick flies in.]]] Bigger. With a body.
The little man was a Joe Average, here to

00:10:47.519 --> 00:10:51.680
learn about power, poverty, or VD.

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:56.329
The FTP ran until 1939, when it was canceled
because it had run through all the money it

00:10:56.329 --> 00:11:01.459
had been allotted, and because some politicians
weren’t too crazy about the Living Newspapers

00:11:01.459 --> 00:11:05.290
and the leftist content they provided. Strike!
Strike! Strike!

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:10.620
By 1940, the Group and the FTP had dissolved,
but they’d left a lasting impression, both

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:15.300
on the style of American writing and acting,
and the network of regional theaters in which

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:20.100
these American plays could now be performed.
Next time, we’re heading back to Europe

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:25.029
for some not-so-political theater created
by the actor, essayist, playwright, genius,

00:11:25.029 --> 00:11:34.650
and occasional madman Antonin Artaud. It’s
the Theater of Cruelty. Until then… curtain,

00:11:34.650 --> 00:12:02.480
with compassion.
