00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.270
So we've finally gone through the first step

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.010
of the central dogma, transcription, and we have

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.340
our MRNA. So the second step of the

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.690
central dogma is to turn that MRNA into protein

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.560
using a process called translation. Translation relies heavily

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.410
on the molecular machinery. On a component known

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.230
as a ribosome. Ribosomes are the main driver

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.500
of translation. Ribosomes are actually able to read an

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.850
MRNA sequence by taking it in at one end and reading the MRNA sequence

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.480
all the way through to the other end. And as it does this, it takes those 20

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.740
amino acids And reads the code determining which

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.260
amino acid belongs in a particular position. Now

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:51.050
one of the most exciting puzzles of the 20th century, was to figure out how this

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.180
code worked? I mean how is that this genetic code

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.196
that these 4 letters and in what combination is that the

00:00:58.196 --> 00:00:58.686
[UNKNOWN]

00:00:58.686 --> 00:01:00.850
can read this. And add the right amino

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.709
acid. Was it one base, one letter, per amino

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:06.730
acid? If true, that would only give us

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.600
four possible combinations: an A, a G, a C,

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.150
or a U, and we know that we have at least 20 amino acids to get to.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.910
If it's two bases per amino acid Then

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.830
that would only be sixteen possible combinations. Things like

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:30.050
AG, AC, AU, GC, GA, GU, and so forth and so on. Only sixteen combinations

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.390
but still 20 amino acids. So just extending

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.940
that logic a little further, what's the minimum

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.450
number of bases needed To have enough combinations

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.230
to code for at least 20 amino acids.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.740
Go ahead and put the number that you think is best in this text box here.
