00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:05.160
We have the number 43,249.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.670
Now, what I want you to think
about is what these two 4's

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.480
actually represent and how
much more value is represented

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.325
by this first 4, this 4 on the
left, than this 4 on the right.

00:00:15.325 --> 00:00:16.950
And I encourage you
to pause this video

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.710
and think about that.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.480
So let's just think about what
each of these digits represent.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.270
So the 9 is in the ones place.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.420
So it literally
represents 9 ones.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.610
This 4 on the right, I should
say, is in the tens place

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:36.610
so it literally represents 4
tens, or 4 times 10, or 40.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.500
This 2 is in the hundreds
place, so it literally

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.780
represents 2 hundreds, or 200.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.950
This 3 is in the
thousands place,

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.350
so it represents 3 thousands.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.480
And then the 4 on the left is
in the ten thousands place.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.690
So it literally
represents 4 times 10,000,

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:02.510
or 4 ten thousands, or 40,000.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.000
So let's actually
compare the value

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.660
that we're getting
here versus here.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.800
So what's the difference
between 40,000 and 40?

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.220
Well, 40,000 has four zeroes
while 40 only has one.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.900
So if you wanted to
go from 40 to 40,000,

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.002
you would have to add
three more zeroes.

00:01:19.002 --> 00:01:20.460
And we already know
how to do that.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.060
You could add three more
zeroes by multiplying by 1,000.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.240
So 40,000 is equal
to 1,000 times 40.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.610
Or we could say the
4 on the left here,

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:40.160
this blue circled 4 represents
1,000 times the value

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.170
as the yellow circled 4.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.570
Now, another way of
thinking about it

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.790
is every time you move
place values to the left,

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.750
as you see here-- this is
tens, hundreds, thousands, ten

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.890
thousands-- you're
increasing what those place

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.230
values represent
by a factor of 10.

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.950
So if you're going from
this 4 to this 4, times 10

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.979
times 10 times 10, you
multiply by 10 the place value.

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.270
And you see that with the
place values right over here,

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.470
the place values increase
by a factor of 10 each time.

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.040
So if you're going from
this place to this place,

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.070
and you have the exact
same digit there,

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.610
multiplying by 10 three
times is the same thing

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.730
as multiplying by 1,000.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.670
So whatever this represents,
multiply it by 1,000,

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.478
and you're going to get
what this represents.
