00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:01.300
[music playing]

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.560
NARRATOR: What would you
do, if you could not chew?

00:00:03.567 --> 00:00:06.967
Did Dr. Seuss write this
script or maybe, Roald Dahl?

00:00:06.967 --> 00:00:10.667
[singing] What would you
do if you could not chew.

00:00:10.667 --> 00:00:11.533
Simple.

00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:13.166
You just thrash your food apart.

00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:16.800
Alligators go through 2,000
to 3,000 teeth in a lifetime.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.500
Seems inefficient,
but hey, they haven't

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.834
evolved in millions of years so
if it ain't broke, why fix it?

00:00:22.834 --> 00:00:25.800
Females also keep an
obsessive vigil over a mound

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.467
of decomposing brush and mud.

00:00:28.467 --> 00:00:30.033
Why?

00:00:30.033 --> 00:00:32.533
Within, lie three dozen
eggs, but she needs

00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:35.433
to be in freshwater to survive.

00:00:35.433 --> 00:00:38.667
She's dug a small wallow near
her nest to rest in the water,

00:00:38.667 --> 00:00:40.533
while keeping an eye on it.

00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:43.667
Helicopter parent-- typical.

00:00:43.667 --> 00:00:45.633
Here, she can relax
and let her heartbeat

00:00:45.633 --> 00:00:48.467
drop to two beats per minute.

00:00:48.467 --> 00:00:52.266
I wish I could get
that kind of rest.

00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:54.734
When her eggs begin to
hatch, she digs them up,

00:00:54.734 --> 00:00:56.300
and inspects them, one by one.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.400
Her monstrous jaws
spell doom for her prey,

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.567
but a comfy nursery
for her babies,

00:01:05.567 --> 00:01:07.600
as she ferries
them to the river.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.967
They're like the minivans
of the reptilian world.

00:01:10.967 --> 00:01:14.100
She'll look after them for up
to a year or more, fiercely

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.533
defending them from
all threats, including

00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:19.500
raccoons and other gators.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.266
If I was a raccoon, I would
not mess with a baby alligator,

00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:25.967
just seeing that footage
of it, killing that deer.

00:01:25.967 --> 00:01:26.867
Are you kidding?

00:01:26.867 --> 00:01:28.000
Go eat a frog or something.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.800
Come on.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.800
Your life is short.
