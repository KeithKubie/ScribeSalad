00:00:00.367 --> 00:00:01.635
Bang!

00:00:01.635 --> 00:00:03.136
Jeez. God.

00:00:03.136 --> 00:00:04.371
Bang!
Jim!

00:00:04.371 --> 00:00:06.206
I'm just going through it again
in my head.

00:00:06.206 --> 00:00:08.942
How do you get three shots off
on a man with two guns?

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.413
And why do you bring him
delicious piping hot Arby's

00:00:13.413 --> 00:00:15.616
right before
you're gonna blow him away?

00:00:15.616 --> 00:00:17.317
How can Juan ...
Don't touch that, Trudy!

00:00:17.317 --> 00:00:18.518
Jim ...

00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:20.220
Put it back.
The first rule ...

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.055
Put it back.
Let's go from the top.

00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:23.357
Okay.
Okay?

00:00:23.357 --> 00:00:25.959
Don't mind me.
I'm just doing cocaine.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.428
Hey Rico.

00:00:28.428 --> 00:00:30.130
Hey.

00:00:31.665 --> 00:00:32.900
What you doing with my blow?

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.134
Just snorting it.

00:00:34.134 --> 00:00:35.536
I went out to get you
a delicious

00:00:35.536 --> 00:00:37.037
piping hot Arby's
roast beef sandwich.

00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:38.272
Oh.

00:00:38.272 --> 00:00:41.008
And I find out you're doing
my blow while I'm gone?

00:00:41.008 --> 00:00:44.444
Jim, this makes your mouth numb.

00:00:44.444 --> 00:00:47.080
Don't do that for real.
From the top.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:52.786
Okay. Places! Okay. I'm sorry.

00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:55.355
Oh, hey Rico, I'm back.

00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:57.424
I'm acting casual,
I'm being cool.

00:00:57.424 --> 00:00:59.192
Nothing's up,
nothing's up at all.

00:00:59.192 --> 00:01:01.595
All I did was go get some
delicious piping hot Arby's.

00:01:01.595 --> 00:01:03.797
I see you're jacking off
in this scenario.

00:01:03.797 --> 00:01:10.938
Okay, well, I got a delicious
beef and cheddar for you.

00:01:10.938 --> 00:01:12.906
And boom,
you're going downtown!

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:14.541
Monkey roll, monkey roll,
monkey roll ...

00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:16.777
Last time you're short
on the count, motherfucker.

00:01:16.777 --> 00:01:18.111
... monkey roll, mon ...
Okay.

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:19.346
Okay, that's the trajectory.

00:01:19.346 --> 00:01:20.614
It's okay, keep going,
keep going.

00:01:20.614 --> 00:01:22.215
Okay.
One, two, three.

00:01:22.215 --> 00:01:23.417
Thanks for the sandwich.

00:01:23.417 --> 00:01:25.285
And I thought I'd bring you
a little peace offering,

00:01:25.285 --> 00:01:26.853
some delicious Arby's.
Go back ...

00:01:26.853 --> 00:01:28.488
No, no, no. No, no, no.
This never happened.

00:01:28.488 --> 00:01:29.723
Oh.

00:01:29.723 --> 00:01:30.958
This never happened
that we know of.

00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.159
Okay.

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.427
You go back, I'm cas ...
No, go back.

00:01:33.427 --> 00:01:34.661
Oh, you said back.

00:01:34.661 --> 00:01:36.763
Rico. Hi Rico.

00:01:37.864 --> 00:01:39.633
I just got back
with that delicious Arby's

00:01:39.633 --> 00:01:41.335
you asked me to get.

00:01:41.335 --> 00:01:42.869
Thanks for the Arby's, Juan.

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.071
I'm clean, man. I'm clean.

00:01:44.071 --> 00:01:45.772
I'm gonna have to check it out.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.576
Check all you want, okay?
Check other places.

00:01:49.576 --> 00:01:51.044
This is probably
what he would do.

00:01:51.044 --> 00:01:52.312
Okay, don't ...

00:01:52.312 --> 00:01:54.881
Hey, Trudy, Trudy, okay, okay,
we get it, we get it, okay?

00:01:54.881 --> 00:01:56.283
Okay.

00:01:56.283 --> 00:01:58.452
Disfrute Rico,
disfrute

00:01:58.452 --> 00:02:00.287
There's over 1000 dollars here.

00:02:00.887 --> 00:02:02.522
Pay attention
for five fucking seconds.

00:02:02.522 --> 00:02:03.857
That's not important,
so you have

00:02:03.857 --> 00:02:05.559
(yelling)

00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:08.929
(bleep)

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.263
... oh, monkey roll,
monkey roll ...

00:02:10.263 --> 00:02:11.765
-Trudy?
-... monkey roll.

00:02:11.765 --> 00:02:13.967
Jim, you got to act out
what you thought it was.

00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:15.268
I know. I agree.

00:02:15.268 --> 00:02:17.170
But you didn't do the part
that I asked you to do. Okay ...

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.405
What part?

00:02:18.405 --> 00:02:20.607
Hey, enjoy. It's my little gift
to you, okay?

00:02:20.607 --> 00:02:22.409
You have a nice time.
Eating Arby's, Eating Arby's,

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:23.677
Eating Arby's,
Eating Arby's, ...

00:02:23.677 --> 00:02:24.945
Eating Arby's, Eating Arby's.

00:02:24.945 --> 00:02:26.246
Boom!

00:02:26.246 --> 00:02:27.647
Monkey roll, monkey roll,
monkey ...

00:02:27.647 --> 00:02:29.082
I was getting the poison,
not monkey roll.

00:02:29.082 --> 00:02:30.283
Oh.

00:02:30.283 --> 00:02:33.053
Poison. And now that
I've poisoned you,

00:02:33.053 --> 00:02:35.122
I'm gonna send a message
to all the other

00:02:35.122 --> 00:02:36.490
capos and hefes,

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.293
and it's gonna go like this,
"Bam, bam,"

00:02:40.861 --> 00:02:44.131
shoot the man
who's already dead. That's it.

00:02:44.131 --> 00:02:45.465
Hey Travis

00:02:45.465 --> 00:02:46.666
Hey, dear.

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:48.301
FBI.
FBI?

00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:50.037
Yes, I can hold.

00:02:50.037 --> 00:02:52.205
I'm on hold with the FBI.
We got it, cracked it.

00:02:52.205 --> 00:02:53.573
You cracked it,
you figured it out?

00:02:53.573 --> 00:02:54.775
Yeah. Already did.

00:02:54.775 --> 00:02:55.976
Already did?

00:02:55.976 --> 00:02:57.177
Poisoned.

00:02:57.177 --> 00:02:58.612
Why'd they shoot him
three times?

00:02:58.612 --> 00:02:59.880
Message to the other hefes.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.148
-Ah.
-Yeah.

00:03:01.148 --> 00:03:02.349
That makes sense.

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:03.884
That makes sense, like the
mafioso shit that they do.

00:03:03.884 --> 00:03:05.585
Message, send a message.
Hey, hey, hey.

00:03:05.585 --> 00:03:07.687
Yeah?

00:03:07.687 --> 00:03:09.122
What are you doing?

00:03:09.122 --> 00:03:10.424
It's evidence.

00:03:10.424 --> 00:03:12.926
Now remember, before I put
the tape up, I got Arby's.

00:03:12.926 --> 00:03:14.327
Oh my god

00:03:14.327 --> 00:03:15.562
You said you were
gonna come here

00:03:15.562 --> 00:03:17.664
and I should leave you some
delicious Arby's on the table

00:03:17.664 --> 00:03:19.032
'cause you wanted
some Arby's too.

00:03:19.032 --> 00:03:20.233
It's cold though.

00:03:20.233 --> 00:03:21.435
You guys have been in here
for like seven hours.

00:03:21.435 --> 00:03:22.636
(bleep)

00:03:22.636 --> 00:03:24.404
... hope they don't have
caller ID.

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:28.041
The FBI probably
has caller ID, right?

00:03:28.608 --> 00:03:29.810
I would think.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.011
They're calling back. Great.
