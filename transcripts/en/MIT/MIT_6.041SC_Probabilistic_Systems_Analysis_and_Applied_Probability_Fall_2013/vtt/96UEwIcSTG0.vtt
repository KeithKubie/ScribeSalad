00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.430
 

00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:00.630
Hi.

00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.280
In this problem, we're going
to look at how to infer a

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:08.810
discrete random variable from
a continuous measurement.

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:11.390
And really, what it's going to
give us is some practice

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:14.950
working with a variation
of Bayes' rule.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.860
So the problem tells us that
we have a discrete random

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.830
variable x with this PMF.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.590
It is 1 with probability P,
minus 1 with probability 1

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.540
minus P, and 0 otherwise.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.940
So here is just a diagram
of this PMF.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.370
And then we also have another
random variable, y, which is

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:34.650
continuous.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.030
And its PDF is given by this.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.700
It's 1/2 lambda e to the minus
lambda times the absolute

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:41.780
value of y.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.760
And so this may look familiar.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.500
It looks kind of like
an exponential.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.200
And in fact, it's just a
two-sided exponential.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.740
That's flattened by
a factor of 1/2.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.060
And this is what it looks like,
kind of like a tent that

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.510
goes on both ways.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.820
And then we have a random
variable z, which is equal to

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.590
the sum of x and y.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.190
And the problem is going to be
figuring out what x is, based

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.550
on an observed value
of what z is.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.940
So because x is discrete
and y is random--

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.390
sorry, x is discrete, and y is
continuous, z is also going to

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:17.520
be continuous.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.100
So our measurement is z,
which is continuous.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.440
And we want to infer x,
which is discrete.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.850
So the problem asked us to
find is this what is the

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:34.090
probability that x equals 1,
given that z is a little z.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.130
And you can write this another
way, just as a

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.870
conditional PMF as well.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:43.700
It's the conditional PMF of
x, given z, evaluated to 1

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.780
conditioned on little z.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.230
All right, so now let's apply
the correct variation of

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:53.210
Bayes' rule.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:02:00.620
So remember, it's going to be
this, the probability that x

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:06.910
equals 1, or the PMF of x
evaluated to 1, times the--

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.580
you flip this conditioning.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.655
So now it's going to be a
conditional PDF of z, since z

00:02:12.655 --> 00:02:14.250
is continuous.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.610
It's going to be a conditional
PDF of z, given x, evaluated

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.450
at some little z condition
on x being 1.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:28.600
And the bottom is the
conditional PDF--

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.510
or sorry, just the
regular PDF of z.

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.270
And of course, we can rewrite
this denominator.

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.560
Remember, the denominator is
always just-- you can use the

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.820
law of total probability
and rewrite it.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.420
And one of the terms is
going to be exactly

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.870
the same as the numerator.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.940
So one of the ways that z can
be some little z is it's in

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.980
combination with x
being equal to 1.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.680
And the probability of that
is exactly the same

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.250
thing as the numerator.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.930
And the other way is if x
is equal to negative 1.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.940
And that gives us this
second term.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.167
 

00:03:12.167 --> 00:03:14.480
All right.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.320
And now let's just fill
in what all these

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.810
different terms are.

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:25.580
So with the PMF of x evaluated
at 1, that is just P. What is

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.240
the conditional PDF of z, given
that x is equal to 1?

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.590
Well, that takes a little
bit more work.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.980
Given that x is 1, then z
is just going to be--

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:48.260
so if x equals 1, then z is
just y plus 1, which means

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.030
that you can just imagine taking
y-- this is what y is,

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.250
the distribution of y--

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.970
and just adding 1 to it, which,
in this diagram, would

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.070
amount to shifting
it over by one.

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:04.320
So now, it would look like
this, the distribution.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.610
And algebraically, all you would
do is just change this

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.075
thing in the absolute
value to y minus 1.

00:04:13.075 --> 00:04:15.976
That amounts to shifting it
over to the right by one.

00:04:15.976 --> 00:04:16.370
All right.

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:17.170
So what is that?

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:25.780
That's just 1/2 lambda,
1/2 lambda, e to the

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.470
minus lambda y--

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.536
sorry, not y, z--

00:04:31.536 --> 00:04:34.870
 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.110
z minus 1.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.820
 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.320
And the denominator, well, the
first term is going to be

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.230
exactly the same.

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:51.790
It's just also P 1/2 lambda e to
the minus lambda z minus 1.

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:52.850
What about the second term?

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.650
The second term, first we need
to figure out what is the PMF

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.280
of x evaluated at
a negative 1.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.790
Or in other words, what's
the probability that

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:00.200
x is negative 1?

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.110
That is given to
us by the PMF.

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.950
It's 1 minus P.

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:08.800
And then the second part is,
what is the conditional PDF of

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.330
z, given that x is negative 1?

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.770
Well, we can just do the same
sort of trick here.

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.810
If x is negative 1, then
z is just y minus 1.

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.950
In which case, the PDF of z
would just look like this.

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:26.710
You're shifted to the
left by one now.

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.140
And now what you have to do is
change this into a plus 1.

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:35.800
So this conditional PDF would
be 1/2 lambda e to the minus

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:42.490
lambda z plus 1, absolute
value of z plus 1.

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.580
All right, so this looks
pretty messy.

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:49.830
And we can try to simplify
things a little bit.

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.880
So we can get rid of
these 1/2 lambdas.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.500
 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:04.910
And then we can multiply the
numerator and the denominator

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:06.390
by the same term.

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:09.200
Let's multiply it by e to
the lambda absolute

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.670
value of z minus 1.

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:13.120
So what we're going to do is
try to cancel out some of

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.960
these exponential terms.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.240
So that will cancel
out this top term.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.206
So all we have in the numerator
now is just P. It

00:06:22.206 --> 00:06:25.910
will also cancel out this
exponential in the

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:27.970
denominator.

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:32.630
And then we'll have to change
this here, because it'll have

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:43.250
an extra e to the lambda
absolute value of z minus 1.

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:46.631
 

00:06:46.631 --> 00:06:51.190
All right, now let's
rewrite this.

00:06:51.190 --> 00:07:04.860
And what we get is plus 1 minus
P e to the minus lambda

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:09.320
absolute value of z plus
1 minus absolute

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.900
value of z minus 1.

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:15.030
 

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:21.670
OK, so that is pretty much as
far as you can go in terms of

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:24.370
simplifying it.

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:27.400
And now the question is, are we

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.870
comfortable with this answer?

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:31.200
And it helps always to try to
interpret it a little bit, to

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.220
make sure that it makes
intuitive sense.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:38.230
And one way to do that is to try
to-- some of the limiting

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:39.960
cases of what some of the
parameters can be.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:44.000
So in this case, the parameters
are P and lambda.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.815
So P is the parameter
related to x.

00:07:46.815 --> 00:07:49.050
And lambda is the parameter
related to y.

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:51.380
So let's try to see if it
makes sense under some

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:53.120
limiting cases.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:08:01.880
The first one we want to think
about is when P goes to 0.

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:05.470
 

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:08.560
So if P goes to 0, what
happens to our answer?

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:12.520
Well, the numerator is 0,
this is 0, this is 1.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.190
But it doesn't matter, because
the numerator is 0.

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:18.630
So in this case, this
would go to 0.

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:20.510
Now does that make sense?

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:22.980
Well, what does that mean
when P goes to 0?

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:28.320
When P goes to 0, that means
that the probability that x is

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:31.580
equal to 1 is 0.

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:36.309
So even without thinking about
y or z, there is already a 0

00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:40.130
probability that x
is equal to 1.

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:45.870
Now this whole calculation, what
we found is, well, if I

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:51.870
had some more information, like
what z is, does that help

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:54.320
me find out what the probability
of x being 1 is?

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:59.830
Well, no matter what z tells me,
I know for a fact that x

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:02.890
can't be 1, because P is 0.

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:08.080
So this posterior, or this
conditional probability,

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:12.840
should also be 0, because
there's just no way

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:15.560
that x can be 1.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:19.530
So in this case, this formula
does check out.

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:24.870
Now let's think about another
case where P goes to 1.

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:30.470
If P goes to 1, that
means that X is for

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:31.510
sure going to be 1.

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:33.710
And it can't be anything else.

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:36.170
In which case, what does
our formula tell us?

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:37.970
Well, this numerator is 1.

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:39.610
This term is 1.

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:41.320
1 minus 1 is 0.

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.440
So the second term gets zeroed
out, and the answer

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:47.710
is just 1/1 is 1.

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:48.610
So what does this tell us?

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:53.600
This tells us that if I know
beforehand that x is for sure

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:57.710
equal to 1, then, if I now give
myself more information

00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:00.790
and condition on what I observe
for z, that shouldn't

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:01.870
change anything else.

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:06.590
I should still know for sure
that x is equal to 1.

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:10.760
So the probability of this
conditional probability should

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:11.940
still be equal to 1.

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:16.760
And it does, so our formula
also works in this case.

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:19.090
Now let's think about lambda.

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:23.040
What about when lambda
goes to 0?

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.330
Well, when lambda goes
to 0, that's a

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:27.510
little harder to visualize.

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:39.590
But really, what would happen
is that you can imagine this

00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:47.670
distribution getting shallower,
shallower and

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:51.720
shallower, lower and lower, so
that it's like it is kind of

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.870
flat and goes on forever.

00:10:54.870 --> 00:11:02.910
And so what this tells you
is that, basically, y--

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:05.310
this is the distribution y-- so
when lambda goes to 0, that

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:10.680
tells you that y has a really
flat and kind of short

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.250
distribution.

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:16.210
And so what does our formula
tell us in this case?

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:21.410
Well, when lambda goes to 0,
this exponent is equal to 0.

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:24.080
And so e to the 0 is 1.

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:29.740
So we get P over P plus 1 minus
P, which is just 1.

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:33.045
So the answer here, our formula
will give us an answer

00:11:33.045 --> 00:11:34.710
of P.

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:36.190
So what does that tell us?

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:39.550
That tells us that, in this
case, if lambda goes to 0,

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:43.700
then our posterior probability,
the probability

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:48.040
that x equals 1 conditioned
on z being some value,

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:52.520
conditioned on our continuous
measurement, is still P. So

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:58.410
the prior, or the original
probability for x being equal

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:01.870
to 1 is P. And with this
additional continuous

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:08.760
measurement, our guess of the
probability that x equal to 1

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:11.100
is still P. So it
hasn't changed.

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:13.280
So basically, it's telling
us that this additional

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:15.930
information was not
informative.

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:19.940
It didn't actually help
us change our beliefs.

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:22.220
And so why is that?

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:25.990
Well, one way to think about
it is that, because the

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:30.180
distribution of y looks like
this, is very flat and it

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:36.750
could be anything, then, if you
observe some value of z,

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:41.890
then it could be that that was
due to the fact that it was x

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:45.610
equal to 1 plus some value
of y that made z

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:47.200
equal to that value.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:50.810
Or it could have just as equally
been likely that x

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:54.580
equal to negative 1 y equals to
some other value that made

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:55.990
it equal to z.

00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:58.670
And so, essentially, it's z--

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:05.550
because y has a shape, it can be
likely to take on any value

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:09.450
that complements either x being
equal to 1 or x equal

00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:13.410
being to negative 1, to make z
equal to whatever the value it

00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:15.590
is that you observe.

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:18.360
And so because of that, in
this case, y is not very

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:19.000
informative.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.610
And so this probability is
still just equal to P.

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:29.570
Now the last case is when
lambda goes to infinity.

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:32.255
And now we have to break
it down into the

00:13:32.255 --> 00:13:34.490
two other cases now.

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:39.610
The first case is when--

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:43.630
lets write this over here--

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:46.020
when lambda goes to infinity.

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:53.730
The first case, it depends on
what this value is, the sine

00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:54.580
of this value.

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:57.960
If this value, the absolute
value of z plus 1 minus the

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:02.270
absolute value of z minus 1,
if that's positive, then,

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:05.520
because lambda goes to infinity
and you have a

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:08.660
negative sign, then this
entire exponential

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:11.670
term will go to 0.

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:13.580
In which case, the second
term goes to 0.

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:19.200
And the answer is
P/P, or is 1.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:28.620
And so if absolute value of z
plus 1 minus absolute value of

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:34.930
z minus 1 is greater than
0, then the answer is 1.

00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:37.480
 

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:44.270
But in the other case, if this
term in the exponent, if it's

00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:50.250
actually negative, if it's
negative, then this negative

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:52.370
sign turns to a positive, and
lambda goes to infinity.

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:56.170
And so this term blows up, and
it dominates everything else.

00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:58.620
And so the denominator
goes to infinity.

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:01.520
The numerator is fixed at P,
so this entire expression

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:02.770
would go to 0.

00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:05.276
 

00:15:05.276 --> 00:15:09.840
OK, so now let's try to
interpret this case.

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:12.000
Let's start with
the first one.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.310
When is it that absolute value
of z plus 1 minus absolute

00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:18.300
value of z minus 1 is
greater than 0?

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:24.450
Or you can also rewrite this as
absolute value of z plus 1

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:27.926
is greater than absolute
value of z minus 1.

00:15:27.926 --> 00:15:29.850
Well, when is that case?

00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:32.030
Well, it turns out, if you think
about it, this is only

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:35.920
true if z is positive.

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:40.010
If z is positive,
then adding 1--

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:43.430
let me draw a line here, and
if this is 0-- if z is

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:46.770
positive, something here, adding
1 to it and taking the

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:47.790
absolute value--

00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:49.240
the absolute value doesn't
do anything--

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:52.010
but you will get something
bigger.

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:55.230
Where subtracting 1 will take
you closer to 0, and so

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:58.490
because of that, the absolute
value, the magnitude, or the

00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:01.750
distance from 0 will be less.

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:07.390
Now if you're on the other side,
adding 1 will take you--

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:12.020
if you're on the other side,
adding 1 will take

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:13.940
you closer to 0.

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:16.150
And so this magnitude
would be smaller.

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:18.570
Whereas, subtracting will take
you farther away, so the

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:22.040
absolute value actually
increased the magnitude.

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:28.520
And so this is the same
as z being positive.

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:33.700
And so this is the same
as z being negative.

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:38.530
So what this tells you is that,
if z is positive, then

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:41.410
this probability
is equal to 1.

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:43.610
And if z is negative, this
probability is equal to 0.

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:45.720
Now why does that make sense?

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:49.810
Well, it's because when lambda
goes to infinity, you have the

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:50.920
other case.

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:55.920
Essentially, you pull this all
the way up, really, really

00:16:55.920 --> 00:17:08.130
far, and it drops off
really quickly.

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:10.869
And so when you take the limit,
as lambda goes to

00:17:10.869 --> 00:17:14.150
infinity, effectively, it just
becomes a spike at 0.

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:19.300
And so, more or less, you're
sure that y is going to be

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:20.420
equal to 0.

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:24.240
And so, effectively, z is
actually going to be equal to

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:26.859
x, effectively.

00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:32.930
And because of that, because x
can only be 1 or negative 1,

00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:37.278
then, depending on if you get a
z that's positive, then you

00:17:37.278 --> 00:17:40.700
know for sure that it must
have been that x

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:42.750
was equal to 1.

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:45.210
And if you get a z that's
negative, you know for sure

00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:48.990
that it must have been that
x was equal to negative 1.

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:54.820
And so because of that, you
get this interpretation.

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:59.620
And so we've looked at four
different cases of the

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:00.600
parameters.

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:04.600
And in all four cases, our
answer seems to make sense.

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:08.030
And so we feel more confident
in the answer.

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:12.320
And so to summarize, this whole
problem involved using

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:14.290
Bayes' rule.

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:18.290
You start out with some
distributions, and you apply

00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:19.860
Bayes' rule.

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:21.230
And you go through the
steps, and you

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:22.650
plug-in the right terms.

00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:25.450
And then, in the end, it's
always helpful to try to check

00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:28.270
your answers to make sure
that it makes sense

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:30.140
in some of the limiting.
