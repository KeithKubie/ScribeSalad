00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.150
FEMALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:07.600
Thank you so much for coming to
our most recent series of NASA

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.890
talks.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.090
Today we have the wonderful
Doctor Kai Goebel,

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.890
if I'm pronouncing
that correctly.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.510
Kai holds an MS and
Ph.D and degrees

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.800
in mechanical engineering
from Cal Berkeley.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.370
He's the Director of
Prognostic Center of Excellence

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.050
at NASA Ames right down
the street from us,

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.440
and the Tech Area Lead of
Discovery and Systems Health

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.040
Area.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.450
Before joining Ames he
spent a decade at GE

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.900
in the corporate R&amp;D, and he
has co-authored more than 250

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.520
papers, and holds 18 patents
in the areas of system health

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.320
management.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.810
Done a good job.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.420
Most importantly, Kai
is very, very excited

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.840
about Germany's recent
win in the World Cup,

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.360
and he said that we should
all feel better here in the US

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.690
that we only lost
1 to 0 to Germany.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.380
So we should feel
good about that.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.730
Without further ado here is Kai,
and please save your questions

00:00:58.730 --> 00:00:59.260
for the end.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.000
And we do have a microphone, so
please talk into the microphone

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.920
so the people on the
Live-screen can hear you.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:04.420
OK.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.970
Thank you.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:05.970
KAI GOEBEL: Thanks Mary.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.040
I hope nobody's here
with Brazilian descent,

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.520
then the 1 0 thing
doesn't quite hold.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.610
We already went over
that so we can skip that,

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.680
but I want to quickly
talk a little bit

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.110
about our organization.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.840
We have approximately
60 people who

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.010
are focusing on this
particular subject area.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.960
We do most of the work for
system health management

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.330
for NASA, or at least we
are the lead organization.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.950
And it is mostly low to mid
technology readiness level.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.170
We divide the maturity
of the technology

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.590
from one to nine in different
stages, and one to seven

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.620
means anything from
conception to prototyping,

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.590
and then we leave the
rest to somebody else

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.230
to implement and actually
use it in a mission context.

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:12.470
So what we do mostly is provide
a state assessment of systems.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.340
And that includes
technology elements

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.920
such as data mining, failure
prediction, fault diagnosis,

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.730
decisioning, physics based
modeling, and quantum

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:25.360
computing.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.680
So that's all stuff that
we deal with in DASH,

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.520
which stands for Discovery
And Systems Health.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.460
And the overall ideas is to
enable resilience of systems,

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.870
and to mitigate off-nominal
kind of conditions.

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:50.270
I'd like to start out with a
definition on the next slides.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.740
Then I'll be talking about why
we care if or whether something

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.230
breaks, and then
talk a little bit

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.360
about how one would go
about dealing with that,

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.030
perhaps preventing it, perhaps
with mitigating something

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.360
that has already been broken.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.370
And then I'll give a few
examples from the NASA context.

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.070
So systems health
management, it's

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.150
the capability to contain,
prevent, detect, diagnose,

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.530
predict, respond to, and
recover from conditions

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.950
that may interfere with
nominal system operations.

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.290
So it's a thing.

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.890
What it means is we
are monitoring stuff,

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:41.660
and if there are any kind
of deviations from how

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:47.540
the system should operate then
we want to recognize that,

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.560
and we want to do
something about it.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.700
Why do we care if
something breaks?

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:00.140
Well, when we build, or buy,
or operate stuff, by stuff

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.180
I really mean equipment,
then there is an expectation

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.020
that it should last
for a little while.

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.430
So nobody wants to spend a few
hundred dollars on something,

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.010
or a few thousand,
or a few million

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.410
on something that
immediately breaks.

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.910
And oftentimes things
do last a long time.

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.750
Sometimes they last even
longer than we expect.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.900
Example might be this
farming equipment.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.360
That thing probably
is 60 or 70 years old,

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.550
and farmers are still
using it in the field.

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.660
And these are extremely
rugged, and robust, and last

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.860
for a long time.

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.500
Sometimes things do not last.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.110
And an example might be here.

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.670
This Aloha flight
that about 30 years

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:56.540
ago or so had an unfortunate
mishap where part of a fuselage

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.640
simply broke off in mid flight.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.590
It just flew off.

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.080
And this is a good
argument for always staying

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.230
buckled in your seats.

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:09.120
Unfortunately a few
people were not,

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.310
so there were a few casualties.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.190
That's bad.

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.880
But this is a clear
example of where you really

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.300
expect the equipment
to function,

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:24.670
and then you are somewhat
unpleasantly surprised

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:26.440
if it does not.

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.740
Obviously we have lots of other
examples where things break

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.650
that cause inconveniences,
or that cause even worse,

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.150
loss of life.

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:39.140
Everybody has a car.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.860
And we have an expectation
that we can drive to work,

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.050
that it doesn't break
down, but we all

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:49.840
know that they can break down.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:55.630
So we do have somewhat
of a throwaway mentality.

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:56.130
Right?

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:00.630
We use something and
then we stuff it away.

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:04.850
But some things don't
really fit too well

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:07.800
into that kind of mindset.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.280
We are expecting that
for certain safety

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:16.250
relevant equipment that
it actually works well.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:19.430
So, in particular, I gave
an example on the slide

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:23.399
before for transportation
systems such as airplanes

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:25.190
you really have the
expectation that if you

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:29.480
get in there that it gets
you safely to the other side,

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.420
to the next airport.

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:36.030
Similarly with cars, or trains,
or ships, or, in our context,

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:37.220
rockets.

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.850
So if you fly a
rocket you really

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:42.610
don't want that
thing to blow up.

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:47.140
In particular, something
of concern for astronauts

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:50.150
who might be sitting
on there, they

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:53.080
have an expectation that that
thing will work reliably.

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:57.560
Power.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:58.680
Nuclear power plants.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.890
We have an expectation
that those things are safe,

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:04.250
and that they work, and
that there are no accidents

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:09.850
or malfunctions that cause
adverse kind of conditions.

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:12.080
These have happened
in the past of course.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.260
We remember Three Mile Island.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.760
We also remember Fukushima.

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.930
If that kind of
equipment malfunctions

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:24.880
there's quickly large
scale kind of consequences,

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.910
and we want to avoid that.

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:29.200
Medical equipment.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:33.510
If you are getting into the
hospital with an emergency

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:37.840
condition you really want the
CT scanner to work, or the MRI.

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.190
You don't want that thing
to break down right then

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:41.060
and there.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:45.310
So you really need that to work.

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:46.830
Another motivation
besides safety

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:49.680
might be that it is
expensive either to replace

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.520
or to operate.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:54.050
Again, in the
context of power you

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:57.570
have these large
stationary gas turbines.

00:07:57.570 --> 00:07:59.260
These are huge.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.300
They could be maybe 30 meter
in diameter or something

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:03.160
like that.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:09.010
And if that breaks down
you cannot operate it.

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:11.530
So the operators are very
unhappy because it costs them

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:15.110
a lot of money, because they
operate on very thin margins.

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:16.960
And it costs a lot
of time to repair it,

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:19.120
because if you have to
crack open a gas turbine

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:22.090
and get to the blade
that has a crack

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:23.740
or something like
that this is a very

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:25.040
expensive kind of undertaking.

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:31.944
Similarly with
wind turbines they

00:08:31.944 --> 00:08:38.120
are oftentimes in very remote
places, and they are very tall,

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.840
and they're very hard to get to.

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:48.840
And if they fail that costs
you money for one to repair,

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.840
but also because you're
not operating it, and not

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:55.370
getting revenue from the
power that you're generating.

00:08:55.370 --> 00:09:00.130
Oil and gas, similarly
pipelines, drill rigs,

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:04.190
mining operations, these are
all kind of expensive operations

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:06.950
where you want stuff
to really work.

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:13.050
IT data server farms, I have
a picture here, networks.

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:16.150
You want those
things to operate.

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:19.790
And that may be something that
you're more interested in.

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:26.620
You can't really
accommodate the fact

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:29.750
that the whole thing goes
down due to the cooling system

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:32.950
breaking, or
something like that.

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:35.266
Manufacturing.

00:09:35.266 --> 00:09:39.040
You might have robotic
equipment or machinery.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:40.450
Everything is automated.

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:43.620
And it costs you money if
that stuff breaks down, again,

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:48.520
to repair, and also from loss
of revenue that it's generating.

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:51.650
Security critical
equipment in buildings,

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:55.590
residential or
commercial, you want

00:09:55.590 --> 00:10:02.410
to make sure that the security
systems work properly,

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:09.130
that it monitors your house,
that it monitors your property.

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:14.430
And if that breaks
that's bad as well.

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:19.920
So NASA cares about that in
the context of crew decision

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:23.320
support in emergency situations.

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:27.110
Again, you know, if you are
sitting on top of a rocket

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:30.930
and you're ready for
blast off, and you

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:36.790
get an indication that there
might be something wrong

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:41.270
then you have to be pretty sure
to either call off the launch,

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:48.740
or if it has already launched
to eject the astronauts.

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:50.760
And then there's a
very subtle trade

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:53.500
off between the false positives
and the false negatives.

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:58.160
Right, so a false positive is if
you're crying wolf and nothing

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:03.980
actually is wrong that's
a really black eye,

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:06.910
because you're
ejecting the pilots,

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:09.030
and you blow up, you
know, $400 million.

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:12.970
And that doesn't look good.

00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:15.180
However, false
negatives are very

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:18.760
unpopular with the astronauts.

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:21.840
And it's mathematically
not possible to really get

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:24.560
both the false positives
and the false negatives,

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:27.230
the likelihood of
both, down to 0.

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:29.540
So you have to find
some sort of trade off,

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:32.245
and the negotiations of
where that set point is,

00:11:32.245 --> 00:11:35.610
is a very interesting
one between the operators

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:36.930
and the astronauts.

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:43.340
You also want to ensure
mission completion.

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:46.400
You want to make sure
that crew can come back,

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:50.350
but also if you have
satellites that are oftentimes

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:54.180
very expensive, hundreds
of millions of dollars,

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:59.260
you can't really afford
to put that into space,

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.190
and then it just doesn't
do anything there simply

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:05.520
because something breaks
that you didn't anticipate

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.025
or that you didn't recognize.

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:14.800
NASA also cares about
cost, increasingly so.

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.710
There's an environment
where cost containment

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:21.520
is a big topic.

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:23.760
So for life cycle
management one is

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:27.440
concerned about life
extension to avoid

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:30.220
unscheduled maintenance,
to increase uptime,

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:36.360
to increase launch availability,
to make informed decisions

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:40.080
whether to go or
cancel an operation,

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:45.730
and in general to reduce risk
with the support of go or no-go

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:46.290
decisions.

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:49.420
And what you see
is the launch pad

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:52.240
where the shuttle
used to launch.

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:55.520
And these are fairly
complex kind of beasts.

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:59.640
So it's not just that you put a
rocket somewhere on the ground,

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:03.010
and light a fuse, and
everything goes up.

00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:07.250
These are incredibly
complex constructs

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:12.214
that have to work just like
any other complex machinery.

00:13:12.214 --> 00:13:13.630
And ultimately you
can use it also

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:16.430
for design improvement where
you feed back the information

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:22.230
about the operation, and also
about the abnormal behavior

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:23.190
into the design.

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:30.080
Here are some
examples where things

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:34.590
didn't go quite as
planned from NASA.

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:37.640
So you see a lot
of satellites here.

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:43.150
Most of them, there's a few
here that we think are on Mars,

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:49.770
but we're not quite sure because
we lost contact and essentially

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:53.500
never were able
to recover those.

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:56.820
There's a few like this
one that had a malfunction,

00:13:56.820 --> 00:14:01.640
and then turned into
so-called "fail-safe" mode.

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:04.750
But the fail-safe mode
was such that the battery

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:08.470
was pointed towards the sun,
which then proceeded to cook.

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:12.870
And then once the battery
is cooked the thing is dead.

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:16.130
Apollo 13, we all know
about the mishap there,

00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:20.050
and then the space shuttle
also had a few accidents

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:21.125
that we all remember.

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:27.891
So what can one
actually do about it?

00:14:27.891 --> 00:14:28.390
Yes.

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:29.587
You have a question.

00:14:29.587 --> 00:14:32.449
AUDIENCE: So what are the common
failures, the common types

00:14:32.449 --> 00:14:35.311
of faults that cause
those failures?

00:14:35.311 --> 00:14:37.230
The fault modes?

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:43.150
KAI GOEBEL: Well, there are
very different fault modes.

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:45.460
Some fault modes that
happen very often

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:48.760
is with the gyroscopes.

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:53.430
So for Kepler, or even
on the space station

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:57.380
there are some
misbehaving gyroscopes

00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:00.010
which can be traced down
to the ball bearings that

00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:02.890
have certain issues when
you operate them in vacuum

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:06.640
because the lubricant
tends to behave

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:12.360
very different in a gravity
free space than with gravity.

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:15.970
In some other cases you have
communications equipment

00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:22.220
that malfunctions, perhaps due
to the presence of radiation.

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:26.190
And so you have single
event upsets, and other kind

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:30.800
of fault modes that
cause some issues.

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:36.790
You may have shorts because
when you're launching something

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:39.970
you have incredible
vibration, and the harnesses

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:41.590
are rattling around.

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:44.200
It might be rubbing
on the fuselage,

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:47.015
and something might short out
that you didn't anticipate.

00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:52.870
You may have
software faults where

00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:55.790
you have inactions of
different software components

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:58.900
that you didn't anticipate
because you have

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:02.390
some new kind of conditions that
you never encountered before,

00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:05.690
and the software was not
meant to handle that.

00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:10.330
And so it does something
unanticipated, and it breaks.

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:14.230
So there's really a myriad of
different kinds of fault modes.

00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:16.620
And that makes it
also so difficult

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:23.450
to anticipate all
of them, and to care

00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:25.240
of all of them ahead of time.

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:27.100
That is of course the idea.

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:29.580
That is what you
would like to do here.

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:34.500
You try to design out
these kind of fault modes

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:35.940
that you know about.

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:38.570
Right, and here
the Rolls Royce is

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:41.830
an example of that
where it was built,

00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:44.150
and then something broke,
and then the next generation

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:47.456
they built a more reliable one.

00:16:47.456 --> 00:16:49.080
And then something
else broke, and they

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.440
tried to take care of that.

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:54.120
And you end up
with two ton beast

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:56.830
which costs you an
incredible amount of money

00:16:56.830 --> 00:16:59.600
but which is known to
be very, very reliable.

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:03.060
And that's one of
the trade offs then.

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:05.140
Right, so how much money
do you want to spend,

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:09.170
and how much risk
do you want to incur

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:11.940
operating these kind of things.

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:16.690
You can also build redundancies,
like in this car where

00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:23.256
you have sort of the dual tires
in the back where one can blow

00:17:23.256 --> 00:17:25.089
and you can still
actually drive this thing.

00:17:25.089 --> 00:17:27.500
It doesn't immediately tip over.

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:30.030
So it's an easy
example of redundancy,

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:36.640
but in space systems you
have redundancies everywhere.

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:40.820
Or oftentimes triple
or quadruple redundancy

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:43.970
to account for the fact
that something might break,

00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:48.070
but you still need to be
able to operate your system.

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:51.560
And, of course, it
comes at the expense

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:54.860
of more weight, and
size, and, again, cost.

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:59.270
Right, so each kilogram that
you have to bring into space

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:01.990
costs you thousands of dollars.

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:06.760
So you are thinking very
carefully, how much more

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:08.900
redundancy do I put on
these kind of systems.

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:13.540
And right now we are going
towards these nano cube,

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:16.160
or nano satellites,
where you really

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.720
can't afford to have
a lot of redundancy

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:22.275
because these are
contradictions in themselves.

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:28.830
So as an alternative
you could try

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:32.180
to recognize impending
failure ahead of time

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:38.230
through analysis and
inference, and then you

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:42.950
could try to handle the
fault ahead of time,

00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:45.880
handle your remaining
resources, possibly extend

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:52.120
the life by reducing
the load by moving up

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:56.280
the important experiments that
you still need to carry out,

00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:00.330
or the important maneuvers that
you still want to carry out,

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:03.930
or doing some other
active kind of thing.

00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:08.890
So in general having information
that something is awry

00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:13.215
and going towards a bad
state is a good thing.

00:19:13.215 --> 00:19:16.730
Right, so here's a picture
everybody recognizes.

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:19.330
This was the Hurricane Katrina.

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:22.280
This was the path that it
was anticipated to take.

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:26.420
And certainly knowing that is
better than not knowing that,

00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:28.500
because you can
evacuate people, and you

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:32.690
can take some sort
of measures to deal

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:33.815
with the kind of situation.

00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:40.620
So how does one determine
equipment health?

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:43.280
So here's a cartoon of a rocket.

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:47.350
And the method for that
that we're using really

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:51.160
is one of health,
of human health.

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:54.550
So what we are doing
is we are going,

00:19:54.550 --> 00:20:00.060
and we're trying to
actually check out

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:02.840
what is the heartbeat
of the equipment.

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:05.790
And then you go
and say, OK, that's

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:10.470
good information, but what
about the temperature?

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:14.490
Right, so having the kind of
dual independent information

00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:16.890
is even more important.

00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:21.970
And then maybe I can
put an ECG on my rocket,

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:26.120
and figure out what is the state
of health of the equipment.

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:31.790
Now, if we stay with
the ECG for a moment

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:37.410
you go through a series
of steps to analyze

00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:39.230
the health of a patient.

00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:43.390
Right, so first you
take your probes here.

00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:46.080
Right, and some of
you may have already

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:50.440
had the pleasure or lack thereof
of having to go through that.

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:52.212
Right, and so there
is some gel that

00:20:52.212 --> 00:20:53.420
is being put on these things.

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:58.490
And the person who administers
that first checks out

00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:02.700
whether those probes
are working well.

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:08.340
Then you have to
interpret the signal.

00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:11.110
So you get some wavy
curve out of your ECG,

00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:14.720
but what does it actually mean.

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:18.690
So you have to interpret what
does the amplitude mean, what

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:23.020
does the steepness of the curve
here mean, how far does it

00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:29.327
dip down, what is the
duration of the pulse,

00:21:29.327 --> 00:21:30.660
and then all that kind of stuff.

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:33.870
And you can see that there are
little symbols here that all

00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:36.570
have some sort of meaning.

00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:38.860
Well, once you have
interpreted that you still

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:42.926
have to figure out whether
that is within normal bounds.

00:21:42.926 --> 00:21:49.660
And if not you have to then
give some sort of diagnosis.

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:53.710
Right, the patient is
moderately ill, or hopefully

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:55.780
not, or something else.

00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:57.960
Now, given the diagnosis
what is the prognosis?

00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:00.690
How much longer do
you have to live?

00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:06.210
And then if you know that,
suggest some sort of therapy.

00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:07.810
Well, in systems
health management

00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:11.850
we do a very similar
thing, except that checking

00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:14.135
the probes we call
sensor validation.

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:21.120
Interpreting the ECG signal
is called feature extraction.

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:23.420
So you're trying to
automatically get

00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:27.200
some information
out of your sensors.

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:30.770
Next you detect whether
there's some sort

00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:33.510
of abnormal condition.

00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:35.620
Is everything healthy or not?

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:37.830
So it's sort of a
rough evaluation

00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:41.870
of the health of the patient.

00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:44.420
Then you do some diagnostics.

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:46.010
You do some prognostics.

00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:48.550
So those terms were
essentially adopted.

00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:52.320
And then ultimately you
mitigate the situation

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:53.930
in some clever way.

00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:55.700
Now, the trick here
is you have to do this

00:22:55.700 --> 00:23:00.100
on some inanimate objects
and some equipment,

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:02.040
and you have to
automate all of that.

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:05.410
Right, so there's no
person who does all that.

00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:08.100
It's all done in some
sort of automated fashion.

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:13.390
And that's where the
art lies in doing that.

00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:16.380
So if we put all
that together then

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:21.300
you have here sort of this
flow diagram of different steps

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:23.010
that we just talked
about that you

00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:26.000
go through in a sequential
kind of fashion.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:31.176
And so, you know, you
pump in raw sensor data.

00:23:31.176 --> 00:23:33.550
And these could be temperature
measurements, or vibration

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:38.580
measurements, or
kerns, or voltages,

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:42.560
or any other kinds
of information

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:47.030
that you get from real sensors.

00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:49.370
So from that you
actually then have

00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:52.480
to extract kind of
information after

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:55.580
you have validated that the
information is actually good.

00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:59.040
Right, if you have a bad
sensor all the inference really

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:04.304
isn't going to help you because
it will just produce garbage.

00:24:04.304 --> 00:24:06.680
You then extract features.

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:10.550
I'm going to show an example
of what that might be.

00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:14.920
And based on those features
then you make a determination

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:17.210
whether you have
an anomaly or not,

00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:20.390
and the output of that are
warnings or alerts that

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:23.890
indicate here is some
anomalous kind of condition.

00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:26.020
But it doesn't say what it is.

00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:28.850
It just says there's
something wrong.

00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:31.090
What is wrong is being
done in the next step.

00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:33.990
So it's the next
step of analysis

00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:39.402
where you figure out, OK, this
is the particular fault mode.

00:24:39.402 --> 00:24:41.360
So coming back to your
question, you don't just

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:42.570
want to know that
something is wrong,

00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:44.410
but you want to know
what exactly is wrong.

00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:44.910
Right?

00:24:44.910 --> 00:24:46.870
Do I have to focus
on my gyroscope,

00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:49.210
or do I have to focus on my
communications equipment,

00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:51.260
or do I have to
focus on my payload.

00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:55.570
And it makes a big difference
in dealing with the situation.

00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:58.650
Then you go into prognostics.

00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:01.450
You want to estimate, well,
OK, something is wrong,

00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:04.750
and I know that's my
communications equipment.

00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:07.750
When will I completely
lose functionality?

00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:10.710
And that is a
function of how you

00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:12.370
are using the equipment
in the future.

00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:14.230
If you are loading
it very heavily

00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:16.330
it might go more quickly.

00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:20.700
If you're not beating
on it very hard then

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:23.870
it might last a little longer.

00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:29.210
And then ultimately you're
doing some fault accommodation

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:32.240
where you're taking
some corrective action.

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:36.330
And that can be a very
complicated kind of thing

00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:39.280
because you may have
multiple objectives that you

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:41.790
are trying to satisfy
at the same time.

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:46.780
And so now we're getting
into optimization routines,

00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:49.890
and often time
multiple objective

00:25:49.890 --> 00:25:56.520
optimization where you
end up with a large number

00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:59.580
of optimal solutions,
and then you still

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:01.450
have to select one of those.

00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:07.680
All right, so let's go
through a quick example

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:08.670
for each one of those.

00:26:08.670 --> 00:26:11.390
I think that it might
make it a little bit more

00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:14.390
clear what we're talking about.

00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:19.780
So in sensor validation you have
some data from some sensors.

00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:23.990
Right, so these could be
pressure sensors and flow

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:25.790
sensors.

00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:30.350
And you go back to the physics,
and one could, for example,

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:33.290
build some analytical
redundancy where

00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:36.717
you know that pressure
and flow are related

00:26:36.717 --> 00:26:38.300
to each other in
some sort of fashion.

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:39.940
And the pressure
upstream of a pipe

00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:42.130
is related to the pressure
downstream of a pipe.

00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:45.920
And if you have a
change in the pressure

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:51.710
then that has to be correlated
to how the pressure is upstream

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:54.350
based on the physics
of the system.

00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:59.310
And one can build
some sort of analytics

00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:03.830
that describe how the
readings are expected

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:07.970
to change if you have
certain changes in one

00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:11.650
part of the system.

00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:14.350
And so it can be expressed
with a few equations.

00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:23.520
And then one would detect if
there is an inconsistency,

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:24.900
and you flag that
kind of sensor,

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:27.610
and say, OK, I'm not going
to trust that one anymore.

00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:29.920
I have to rely on
the other ones.

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:33.960
And I can still
continue my analysis,

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:36.380
but I have weeded
out the bad sensor.

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:39.290
And that is actually
an important step

00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:41.630
in the overall concept.

00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:44.040
Similarly to the
ECG, you don't want

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:47.420
to perform your ECG
with some bad probes.

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:50.640
It just doesn't make sense.

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:53.255
And here it's important that
that is done automatically

00:27:53.255 --> 00:27:54.880
because there is
nobody standing there.

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:59.940
There's nobody standing on
the wind turbine checking

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:02.412
those probes on a daily
basis, or on an hourly basis.

00:28:02.412 --> 00:28:03.745
It has to be done automatically.

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:11.140
So next you have to
extract features.

00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:14.920
So the question is if you
have a bunch of data points

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:16.890
in a way where you have,
this is the magnitude

00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:20.740
of something, maybe pressure,
or temperature, or vibration,

00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:23.860
and here you have time, you
get these data points in,

00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:25.430
but what do they mean?

00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:27.690
Where's the information.

00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:31.020
And there's a lot of signal
processing techniques

00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:34.010
that can be employed
to really pull out

00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:36.160
information out of raw data.

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:39.580
So you're not just looking
at the magnitude, which

00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:43.420
of course can be
important information,

00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:46.008
but there's more than that.

00:28:46.008 --> 00:28:46.508
Right?

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:56.260
You can extract information
also in the frequency domain,

00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:59.470
or in the chaotic domain,
or in any other domain.

00:28:59.470 --> 00:29:06.571
So you can transform the
data into a different domain.

00:29:06.571 --> 00:29:09.380
A Fourier transform
is an example there,

00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:11.980
or a wavelet transform.

00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:16.890
And then extract features
in that kind of domain.

00:29:22.126 --> 00:29:24.490
So let's see.

00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:28.770
So we want the features to be
explainable in physical terms,

00:29:28.770 --> 00:29:30.560
mathematically definable.

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:32.740
We, of course, want
of them not only

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:35.850
to look pretty, but have some
sort of meaning with regards

00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:39.290
to the fault that I'm
trying to diagnose.

00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:40.810
It should ideally
be uncorrelated

00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:42.920
with other features.

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:46.600
It should be insensitive
to extraneous variables,

00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:50.120
and also not too
expensive to measure

00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:55.750
if I have limited computational
resources on my asset.

00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:57.900
Which may not be as
much of a concern

00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:01.110
if you have a
ground based system.

00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:03.870
But if you have a space
based system, again,

00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:06.210
if you want to put a
supercomputer on a nano

00:30:06.210 --> 00:30:11.330
satellite that's not
going to be so easy.

00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:14.650
And then of course you can
derive features of features

00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:18.090
where you are extracting
information from the features,

00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:22.170
or you're combining them in
some sort of smart fashion.

00:30:22.170 --> 00:30:26.300
And there's a few
examples here where

00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:29.090
you have various
statistics moments,

00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:31.960
or combine them in
some other fashion.

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:34.980
And one can also automate that.

00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:37.847
So you don't need to necessarily
know all of that ahead of time

00:30:37.847 --> 00:30:38.680
what you want to do.

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:40.810
You can have
learning algorithms,

00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:42.670
or machine learning
algorithms that

00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:48.010
explore the space of features
and find new features for you.

00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:49.890
So you could use
genetic programming,

00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:53.920
or genetic algorithms, or
other optimization tools that

00:30:53.920 --> 00:31:00.360
find combinations of
different features.

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:01.875
And I already
talked about Fourier

00:31:01.875 --> 00:31:03.460
and transform [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:06.890
So now we have only
gone to the point

00:31:06.890 --> 00:31:08.590
of actually deriving features.

00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:11.620
Now I actually have to
make a determination

00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:15.040
of whether something
is anomalous or not.

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:16.640
And how would I do that?

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:19.390
So the question
here is in this data

00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:25.470
set I'm just looking at
the last four data points.

00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:31.500
Are those in the normal
range or are those abnormal?

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:34.330
So who thinks these are normal?

00:31:37.390 --> 00:31:38.760
Who thinks they are abnormal?

00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:44.270
OK, I need a brave soul here.

00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:45.540
And who has no opinion?

00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:47.050
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:47.550
OK.

00:31:47.550 --> 00:31:48.008
All right.

00:31:48.008 --> 00:31:48.507
All right.

00:31:48.507 --> 00:31:49.840
Ha, ha, ha.

00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:52.460
OK, maybe it's hard
to tell, right.

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:56.490
So we don't really know.

00:31:56.490 --> 00:32:00.100
So one example of a tool
that one could use here,

00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:01.950
and there's literally
hundreds of them,

00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:07.400
is the Rank
Permutation Test, which

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:11.160
transforms the data in
some sort of ranking space,

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:15.910
and then performs a hypothesis
test in that rank space.

00:32:15.910 --> 00:32:20.350
So you determine
a null hypothesis,

00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:24.080
which is the data
are abnormal or not.

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:28.050
Then you choose some sort
of test statistics, which

00:32:28.050 --> 00:32:30.560
in this case here
is the sum of ranks.

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:32.220
Then you compute
the test statistic

00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:35.440
for original observations,
permute the observations,

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:38.870
recalculate the test statistic,
and repeat that 1,000 times

00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:41.340
or so, and then you
either accept or reject

00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:45.860
the null hypothesis that
this is normal data.

00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:51.750
And if you do that many
times, like here, right.

00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:58.500
So you just sample your
space before those.

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:01.940
You do this over, and
over, and over again,

00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:05.020
and you compare those data
that you sample with the ones

00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:07.510
that you're investigating.

00:33:07.510 --> 00:33:10.110
And then after you
do this 1,000 times,

00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:14.150
and I'm not going to do
it many more times I hope,

00:33:14.150 --> 00:33:17.940
you calculate the
statistics, and you

00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:21.860
look where are your
data points here,

00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:24.630
which is where the
line is, and you

00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:26.840
can see that most
of the data actually

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:31.300
is on the right
side of that curve.

00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:34.640
And if you calculate
that it turns out

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:46.630
that there's a 99.3% almost
chance that this data is not

00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:56.310
normal, which is not obvious
when you look at the data

00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:58.320
as they were originally.

00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:00.680
They were sort of
within the bounds,

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:04.260
but they were just
slightly clustered outside.

00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:08.940
And so that is an example of how
one could make a determination

00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:12.909
that data are abnormal or not.

00:34:12.909 --> 00:34:17.969
Obviously where you put the
threshold is completely up

00:34:17.969 --> 00:34:18.469
to you.

00:34:18.469 --> 00:34:23.190
Right, so if you want
to have a 99.999%

00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:25.560
confidence that something
is abnormal or not

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:28.489
then you would have
to wait for the signal

00:34:28.489 --> 00:34:32.449
to become more clear.

00:34:32.449 --> 00:34:37.760
So now that we know that
something is not normal

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:43.489
we want to go and analyze
the data with regards

00:34:43.489 --> 00:34:46.050
to the fault mode.

00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:48.889
And that can be done through
a number of different ways.

00:34:48.889 --> 00:34:51.600
One will be to have some
sort of inference systems

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:55.340
which could be
implemented through a rule

00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:58.850
based system, where you have
different kinds of rules, where

00:34:58.850 --> 00:35:06.240
if A is B than C.
And you can have

00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:08.240
a number of different rules.

00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:11.790
And you could see whether any
of those rules are triggered.

00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:14.630
And then you could make
an inference with regards

00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:18.810
to the particular root cause.

00:35:18.810 --> 00:35:22.660
You also have to deal with
the fact that some of the data

00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:28.210
may be not completely crisp, or
that the fact that the data are

00:35:28.210 --> 00:35:34.740
very, very close to a threshold
just on one side of it

00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:40.440
may result in your diagnostics
to fluctuate a lot.

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:44.260
And so you have to deal with
uncertainty in some fashion.

00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:46.050
And there's different
ways to do that.

00:35:46.050 --> 00:35:50.860
You could do it with, in
a probabilistic sense,

00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:52.760
you could use fuzzy logic.

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:54.870
You could use a number
of different ways

00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:59.310
to deal with uncertainty.

00:35:59.310 --> 00:36:03.540
And then the term fuzzy
logic is sometimes

00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:07.760
used to express that nothing
serious is being done,

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:13.100
but in fact it is a methodology
that you have to step through.

00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:17.040
And there's very clear
rules how to deal

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:20.640
with information in
some specific way.

00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:24.470
And this just shows
an example of that

00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:32.050
where you have some facts where
X is A and Y is B, and a rule,

00:36:32.050 --> 00:36:36.020
and you have to
come to some sort

00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:39.730
of a conclusion
about the result.

00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:43.580
And this is just a visual
of how you go about that,

00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:47.140
and then you end up with
geometric constructs,

00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:50.160
and you have to take out some
actual crisp decision out

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:52.640
of that.

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:55.430
And there's some
methodology to it

00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:58.150
that you go through
to accomplish that.

00:36:58.150 --> 00:37:02.970
OK, now that we know that my
communication system is bad

00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:06.660
now I want to know
at what point does

00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:13.140
it fail so that I have
lost complete function

00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:14.700
of that equipment.

00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:17.180
And that is done in prognostics.

00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:19.960
Now you're trying to
estimate how much time

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:22.790
do I have until that happens.

00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:28.840
And so there's a
graph here that shows

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:33.760
that, where you have time
here, and the health here,

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:35.760
and the health
deteriorates oftentimes

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:39.940
in some sort of
nonlinear fashion.

00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:43.310
And you're predicting it
at different time points

00:37:43.310 --> 00:37:46.810
how much time do I have
until I reach a threshold.

00:37:46.810 --> 00:37:50.520
This would be my end
of life threshold.

00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:54.110
How much time do I have
until that happens?

00:37:54.110 --> 00:38:00.680
And so that is done again
using some mathematical tools

00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:04.240
where you're not just
waving your hand,

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:06.850
or you're using some straight
line extrapolation and saying,

00:38:06.850 --> 00:38:10.755
OK, it may be here in
some time in the future.

00:38:10.755 --> 00:38:13.255
You have to account for the
fact that your system may behave

00:38:13.255 --> 00:38:16.100
in some non-linear fashion,
which, again, is driven

00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:18.000
by the physics of the system.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.100
And so you have to encapsulate
that in some smart fashion.

00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:28.230
That could be done
either by using data.

00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:31.370
So you could have a data
driven kind of approach

00:38:31.370 --> 00:38:34.910
where you have
observed your system,

00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:38.020
or a fleet of
systems many times,

00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:40.530
and you have all kinds of
trajectories that inform you

00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:45.340
about how the
system deteriorates.

00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:48.230
And then you can build, again
with machine learning tools,

00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:51.750
a representation of the
deterioration over time.

00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:58.300
Or you have to
build a model that

00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:00.430
is based on the
physics of the system

00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:08.480
that you're using to
express the expected change

00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:09.980
of the degradation
of the system.

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:13.680
And that you have to do when
your fleet is not very large.

00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:17.750
So that is something that
we at NASA have very often.

00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:23.310
Your fleet size is
not 20,000 or 100,000.

00:39:23.310 --> 00:39:26.130
Sometimes it's one.

00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:30.690
And so you can't blow
up 35 test rockets just

00:39:30.690 --> 00:39:35.660
to see what happens
when my case cracks.

00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:38.010
It's too expensive.

00:39:38.010 --> 00:39:42.150
Or you cannot wait for
that to happen either.

00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:47.590
So really have to wrap your
head around what is actually

00:39:47.590 --> 00:39:49.240
happened at the
physical level when

00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:52.500
there's a crack in
my rocket casing,

00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:55.060
and how is that
growing as a function

00:39:55.060 --> 00:40:00.400
of the internal temperatures
and pressures of the rocket.

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:10.890
So another example is
here on the launch pad

00:40:10.890 --> 00:40:16.050
that I showed
earlier, you have some

00:40:16.050 --> 00:40:21.000
in these spheres here,
your liquid propellant.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:24.070
It's oxygen and hydrogen.

00:40:24.070 --> 00:40:29.600
And so there is a 1.5 kilometer
line here to this oxygen tank.

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:33.370
And then if you go out
here's the launch pad,

00:40:33.370 --> 00:40:38.090
and on the other side, far on
the other side is the hydrogen.

00:40:38.090 --> 00:40:40.590
And you want to keep those
two really far apart.

00:40:40.590 --> 00:40:42.480
And you want to wait
until the very end

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:45.090
before you get them
close together,

00:40:45.090 --> 00:40:52.360
because for obvious reasons
it's very dangerous.

00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:55.450
So you also want to make
sure that any of these pumps

00:40:55.450 --> 00:40:56.740
and valves are working.

00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:59.350
Right, once you actually
say, OK, system is a go,

00:40:59.350 --> 00:41:06.710
OK, now we're pumping 100,000
liters of liquid oxygen

00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:10.300
into the external tank
of the space shuttle,

00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:13.777
or whatever vehicle
you have there,

00:41:13.777 --> 00:41:15.360
you don't want to
get into a situation

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:19.240
where you say, oh, sorry,
my valve is stuck right now.

00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:22.720
Can we scrub the launch?

00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:24.860
That immediately costs
you a lot of money,

00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:26.870
and makes a lot of
people very unhappy.

00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:28.790
And your launch
window may no longer

00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:31.850
be open because of weather or
other kinds of considerations.

00:41:31.850 --> 00:41:35.360
And so it really needs to be
available when you need it.

00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:37.780
So you need to
have an assessment

00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:43.730
of the goodness of the health
of these kinds of pieces

00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:45.920
of the equipment.

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:50.030
And so here are some
examples of valves,

00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:51.530
I'm not sure how
well you are seeing

00:41:51.530 --> 00:41:54.880
that, or pumps that
are being used.

00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:56.600
Some of them are pretty old.

00:41:56.600 --> 00:42:02.160
Some of these tanks have been
used during the Apollo era.

00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:04.670
So that was a long time ago.

00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:12.580
So the pump that I just
showed can be modeled.

00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:15.840
Right, so here's just
a cartoon of that,

00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:19.520
but fundamentally what you
have is just a plug here.

00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:23.320
And here's the pipe
with the fluid flow.

00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:28.310
And if the plug advances, then
the fluid flow is interrupted.

00:42:28.310 --> 00:42:32.000
If it goes up, then
obviously something can flow.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.590
And you do that by
opening the valve

00:42:34.590 --> 00:42:40.960
by pumping in some
pneumatic air in here that

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:44.190
lifts the piston up
against a return spring.

00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:48.330
And there is a port up
here that opens and allows

00:42:48.330 --> 00:42:49.590
the air to escape.

00:42:49.590 --> 00:42:55.860
And if everything fails
this particular valve

00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:57.630
has a fail-safe of closed.

00:42:57.630 --> 00:43:01.120
Right, so the return spring
then forces the plug down,

00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:03.160
and it interrupts the pressure.

00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:10.550
Now, seems extremely simple,
but if you have some wear here

00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:12.910
then you have some
leakage along the plug.

00:43:12.910 --> 00:43:16.450
Or if you have a wear along
the piston and the wall

00:43:16.450 --> 00:43:19.750
that's no good because then not
enough pressure can be built up

00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:23.610
to open the valve.

00:43:23.610 --> 00:43:25.490
Similarly, if the
return spring gets weak

00:43:25.490 --> 00:43:30.950
or if there's some leakage
across the top port

00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:34.720
you have some consequences that
you somehow have to deal with.

00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:37.920
And so even for a
very simple component

00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:43.180
like that you have half a dozen
fault modes that you can model,

00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:49.160
and that you can account
for, and that one can use.

00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:54.900
One still has to figure out what
is my end of life criterion.

00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:57.700
And you can go back
to the specifications

00:43:57.700 --> 00:44:00.410
and say, OK, the valve
has to open or close

00:44:00.410 --> 00:44:01.730
within a certain time frame.

00:44:01.730 --> 00:44:05.560
So let's say the valve has
to open in five seconds.

00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:10.440
And usually if everything works
well it opens in 1.5 seconds.

00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:13.030
But as things are
degrading you see

00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:16.360
that it opens slower and slower,
and eventually will no longer

00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:18.740
meet your functional spec.

00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:21.340
That's just to
say that you don't

00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:26.810
have to wait for something
to explode or something

00:44:26.810 --> 00:44:29.070
catastrophic to happen
to define a failure.

00:44:29.070 --> 00:44:33.660
What we actually need is a
mathematically quantifiable

00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:36.300
threshold that we
can work towards,

00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:39.890
and that we can define
how far away are we

00:44:39.890 --> 00:44:42.480
from that threshold.

00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:43.950
And that's actually
very important

00:44:43.950 --> 00:44:48.010
to ultimately calculate
what is my remaining life.

00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:54.960
And then you go
into your modeling.

00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:58.590
You express your valve
state through positions

00:44:58.590 --> 00:45:02.180
and velocities, and gas mass
above and below the piston.

00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:07.290
And then you do some state
derivatives and inputs.

00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:11.394
Has anybody seen anything
like that before?

00:45:11.394 --> 00:45:13.060
All right, we have a
few engineers here.

00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:15.280
Excellent.

00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:17.470
And then you do physics 101.

00:45:17.470 --> 00:45:20.210
Right, so you have
some piston movement,

00:45:20.210 --> 00:45:21.660
and that kind of stuff.

00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:27.890
And then you do physics 201.

00:45:27.890 --> 00:45:31.022
You express your gas flows,
and that kind of stuff.

00:45:31.022 --> 00:45:32.396
There's nothing
magic about here.

00:45:32.396 --> 00:45:33.860
This is all textbook
stuff, right?

00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:36.440
But it actually gets
employed to express

00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:38.950
the expected behavior
of your system.

00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:42.360
And so everything that
you learned in physics

00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:45.790
in high school and later
in college actually gets

00:45:45.790 --> 00:45:48.490
used here.

00:45:48.490 --> 00:45:53.890
And then you go and look at what
kind of sensors do you have?

00:45:53.890 --> 00:45:56.480
And from that you
can then model what

00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:58.300
is your expected
behavior of your system.

00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:00.300
Right, how should
your valve open

00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:06.690
and close based on the
expression of the physics?

00:46:06.690 --> 00:46:08.890
And then you can
also model damage.

00:46:08.890 --> 00:46:13.250
So you may have
increase in friction,

00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:17.810
or you may have a decrease
in friction due to wear.

00:46:17.810 --> 00:46:21.750
And all that then ultimately,
which is expressed down here,

00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:25.810
leads to changed
characteristics of the opening

00:46:25.810 --> 00:46:29.520
or the closing of the valves.

00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:31.790
And that is expressed here.

00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:35.630
Based on the
particular fault mode

00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:41.640
you see that these curves change
as a function of the cycles,

00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:46.860
in this particular case
of operating of the valve.

00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:52.510
And then you still
have to deal with, OK,

00:46:52.510 --> 00:46:54.960
now that I know what my
state is now how will it

00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:56.270
change in the future?

00:46:56.270 --> 00:47:01.070
And so you have to extrapolate
that out into the future.

00:47:01.070 --> 00:47:03.260
And one particular
technique that can be used

00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:05.605
is called a particle filter.

00:47:05.605 --> 00:47:07.730
Many of you may have heard
of a [INAUDIBLE] filter.

00:47:07.730 --> 00:47:10.160
A particle filter is
something like that.

00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:12.440
So it's not a physical
thing where, you know, like

00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:14.580
in your vacuum where
you have your filter.

00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:16.760
It's a mathematical tool.

00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:23.800
And I'm not going to go into
details of how to use that,

00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:27.780
but the whole point
is that you are

00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:29.530
going into the future
with different kinds

00:47:29.530 --> 00:47:40.330
of possible path to then express
your end of life prediction

00:47:40.330 --> 00:47:45.610
through a probability mass
function, in which it then

00:47:45.610 --> 00:47:48.770
can approximate with a
probability density function.

00:47:48.770 --> 00:47:51.830
So there's not just one
point that you're getting,

00:47:51.830 --> 00:47:53.950
unfortunately,
because you may have

00:47:53.950 --> 00:47:56.830
a lot of uncertainty due to
your sensor measurements,

00:47:56.830 --> 00:48:01.270
or your model is bad, and
your future load predictions.

00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:10.590
So your actual remaining
life will be a curve,

00:48:10.590 --> 00:48:13.260
and can be approximated with the
probability density function.

00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:16.230
But you can still
choose, as I choose

00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:20.080
here the meeting of
the curve, or, again,

00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:21.830
if I want to be
conservative I can

00:48:21.830 --> 00:48:28.740
be on that side of the curve
and take the extremely risk

00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:31.330
averse point.

00:48:31.330 --> 00:48:35.850
But the point of that
is you buy yourself

00:48:35.850 --> 00:48:39.190
that much time to
actually do something.

00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:42.130
So you don't have to wait until
it actually breaks, and you

00:48:42.130 --> 00:48:47.070
don't have to replace the valve
on a conservative schedule

00:48:47.070 --> 00:48:48.940
every 10 cycles.

00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:51.340
You actually know
with high confidence

00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:55.750
that you can operate this
thing safely that many times

00:48:55.750 --> 00:49:00.050
without an expectation that
something bad is happening.

00:49:00.050 --> 00:49:01.752
And that's the beauty
of that approach.

00:49:01.752 --> 00:49:03.460
And then of course
you're repeating that.

00:49:03.460 --> 00:49:05.990
As you're using it you're
collecting more information

00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:08.690
about the current state
of health of the system.

00:49:08.690 --> 00:49:11.440
You're updating your expectation
of what is happening.

00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:14.660
And if you did
everything right then

00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:17.220
this curve actually
will not move.

00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:19.400
You're just moving through time.

00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:25.340
And the PDF here will just
get steeper and more narrow

00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:32.570
because you're taking
out more uncertainty.

00:49:32.570 --> 00:49:35.540
And then you're going to
calculate your performance.

00:49:35.540 --> 00:49:39.070
And then ultimately you
do something about it.

00:49:39.070 --> 00:49:44.320
And, again, you're using
different kinds of techniques

00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:46.380
to go about that.

00:49:46.380 --> 00:49:48.650
And what you're doing
with information,

00:49:48.650 --> 00:49:51.570
you have 50 cycles
left, is different

00:49:51.570 --> 00:49:55.550
than if I tell you that
I have five cycles left.

00:49:55.550 --> 00:49:59.790
Or if we express it
in time, if I tell you

00:49:59.790 --> 00:50:03.670
that your system will break
in 30 milliseconds there's

00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:08.120
no point scheduling maintenance
to accommodate that, right?

00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:10.970
If I tell you that your system
will break in three months,

00:50:10.970 --> 00:50:12.960
well, now I can
schedule maintenance

00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:14.170
when it's convenient for me.

00:50:14.170 --> 00:50:18.160
If I have the guy go out to
the wind turbine in two months

00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:20.470
anyway, well, maybe
he should look

00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:26.000
at the other one next to
it, and that saves me money.

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:31.840
Or, again, if I have
30 milliseconds left

00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:35.390
I go immediately into a
fail-safe mode reflexively.

00:50:35.390 --> 00:50:40.900
If I have three hours left
I can think about mission

00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:43.770
rescheduling or
re-planning, and, again,

00:50:43.770 --> 00:50:47.600
do the right kind of thing.

00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:48.100
All right.

00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:50.940
So these kind of concepts
we implemented here

00:50:50.940 --> 00:50:55.870
on our rover concept.

00:50:55.870 --> 00:51:01.050
This is sort of the monster
truck of the rovers.

00:51:01.050 --> 00:51:07.690
And we used the Nexus S for part
of the instrumentation suite.

00:51:07.690 --> 00:51:12.250
Obviously as you know it has a
whole bunch of sensors on there

00:51:12.250 --> 00:51:14.240
which is extremely convenient.

00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:17.940
It also has communications,
wireless communication

00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:19.670
and storage on there.

00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:23.250
And we have taken
advantage of that.

00:51:23.250 --> 00:51:25.320
You just plop that
thing on there,

00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:27.050
and in principle
you could use that

00:51:27.050 --> 00:51:28.840
for all kinds of
different things, right,

00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:31.670
not just for rovers,
but you could put it

00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:34.150
on many different
types of equipment

00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:40.210
to enable the kind of reasoning
that I just described.

00:51:40.210 --> 00:51:43.230
In this particular case
the fault modes of interest

00:51:43.230 --> 00:51:48.200
that we're interested in were
motor winding deterioration,

00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:51.590
battery charge depletion,
capacity degradation,

00:51:51.590 --> 00:51:56.100
some parasitic electrical load,
increased mechanical friction,

00:51:56.100 --> 00:52:00.500
and we built some fault
injection mechanisms

00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:01.520
onto the rover.

00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:06.490
So sometimes you have to
wait a long, long time

00:52:06.490 --> 00:52:08.510
until something bad happens.

00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:12.880
So here since we didn't want to
wait 30 years for the bearing

00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:17.550
to go bad or something like that
we helped things a little bit,

00:52:17.550 --> 00:52:23.900
and built in mechanisms that
put in a parasitic load, which

00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:27.170
resulted in the
battery discharging

00:52:27.170 --> 00:52:29.320
faster and degrading faster.

00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:32.770
And so it's a nice
validation tool

00:52:32.770 --> 00:52:35.520
that allows you to test out
different kind of concepts,

00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:39.700
also for mitigation, which
are important in sort

00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:41.220
of an autonomous context.

00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:43.780
Right, so if you have
a rover go around,

00:52:43.780 --> 00:52:47.550
and it experiences
some deterioration,

00:52:47.550 --> 00:52:51.080
well, what do you want to do?

00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:53.770
I mean, this is our self
driving car fundamentally.

00:52:53.770 --> 00:52:54.380
Right?

00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:59.870
So if your self driving
car is degrading, well,

00:52:59.870 --> 00:53:02.440
are you going to do
something about it or not?

00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:04.519
And the right answer
is, yes, of course I

00:53:04.519 --> 00:53:06.060
want to do something
about it, right?

00:53:06.060 --> 00:53:08.600
So what do I want
to do about it?

00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:10.070
And again it depends.

00:53:10.070 --> 00:53:12.730
And how you go
about that has to be

00:53:12.730 --> 00:53:18.810
done in a mathematically
rigorous fashion, which

00:53:18.810 --> 00:53:22.120
can be described,
for example, using

00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:24.600
different types of
optimization techniques.

00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:29.290
You have to build a
simulator into your tool that

00:53:29.290 --> 00:53:35.500
explores different kinds
of mitigating options,

00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:41.390
and then implements
the right solution.

00:53:41.390 --> 00:53:44.920
So on a self
driving car or rover

00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:50.000
it could be don't go 75 miles an
hour, go only 55 miles an hour.

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:53.690
It buys you enough time to
actually get to the target.

00:53:53.690 --> 00:54:01.600
Or it could be, well, we have
to cut the scenic route short,

00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:04.940
and we can't do
these way points.

00:54:04.940 --> 00:54:07.900
You know, we have to cut a few
off, and get you back earlier.

00:54:07.900 --> 00:54:11.500
But at least we know that it's
important to you to get back,

00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:14.710
and we can satisfy that
particular constraint,

00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:16.340
and so on.

00:54:16.340 --> 00:54:20.920
And so that's shown here where
we have different way points.

00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:23.160
This is the route
that we wanted to do.

00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:28.370
Here we found that
there was a fault.

00:54:28.370 --> 00:54:30.350
And the mission
re-planner then said,

00:54:30.350 --> 00:54:32.850
OK, I have to cut out
this way point here,

00:54:32.850 --> 00:54:35.160
and I'm going straight
back, but I'm going back

00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:42.120
with some margin that allows
you to complete the mission.

00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:44.380
Some examples here.

00:54:44.380 --> 00:54:46.160
What we use, the
techniques that I just

00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:49.900
described for rocket
engine test stands,

00:54:49.900 --> 00:54:53.850
for robotic spaceflights,
aeronautics.

00:54:53.850 --> 00:54:56.780
Right, so the first A in
NASA actually is Aeronautics.

00:54:56.780 --> 00:55:02.700
So we do a lot of work with
aircraft and other kinds

00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:06.570
of things that fly
within the atmosphere.

00:55:06.570 --> 00:55:07.665
Composite shrouds.

00:55:10.370 --> 00:55:11.675
ISS.

00:55:11.675 --> 00:55:14.332
And et cetera.

00:55:14.332 --> 00:55:15.680
All right.

00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:19.360
So what did I just show you?

00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:21.500
We use system health management.

00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:24.000
And we understand it as
a systematic engineering

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:30.870
discipline that is used
to monitor systems,

00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:33.380
to determine whether
things run as expected,

00:55:33.380 --> 00:55:35.860
or whether and when
they might break.

00:55:35.860 --> 00:55:41.500
And the core elements within
that suite of techniques,

00:55:41.500 --> 00:55:49.470
or that umbrella are monitoring,
modeling behavior, recognizing

00:55:49.470 --> 00:55:52.440
anomalous behavior,
predicting time

00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:53.950
to some sort of
boundary condition,

00:55:53.950 --> 00:55:56.760
and ultimately also
mitigating that.

00:55:56.760 --> 00:55:59.810
Some of the remaining
challenges that we still

00:55:59.810 --> 00:56:05.306
have-- Not everything
is done-- are

00:56:05.306 --> 00:56:08.410
to implement learning
and adaptive systems.

00:56:08.410 --> 00:56:11.280
So for us space is still
the final frontier.

00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:13.110
We actually don't
know what's out there

00:56:13.110 --> 00:56:14.990
and how systems
will be behaving.

00:56:14.990 --> 00:56:18.530
So we have to build
in a system that

00:56:18.530 --> 00:56:25.000
can adapt to those unanticipated
changes and do the right thing.

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:26.900
Software complexity.

00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:29.710
V&amp;V certification--
That may be something

00:56:29.710 --> 00:56:34.290
that resonates with you as
well-- is something that

00:56:34.290 --> 00:56:37.320
is increasingly a
challenge to make sure

00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:41.700
that our complex systems
will be behaving properly.

00:56:41.700 --> 00:56:43.870
Uncertainty management.

00:56:43.870 --> 00:56:46.170
So nothing is deterministic.

00:56:46.170 --> 00:56:47.740
Right, everything
has uncertainty.

00:56:47.740 --> 00:56:52.280
How do I properly express,
or represent, and encapsulate

00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:56.070
my uncertainty, and deal with
that in a decision making

00:56:56.070 --> 00:56:57.610
context?

00:56:57.610 --> 00:57:00.010
And then ultimately
decision making itself.

00:57:00.010 --> 00:57:04.400
Right, tie the information
back to the benefit

00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:06.560
that you're trying
to generate, which

00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:09.560
could be completing the mission,
or bringing the astronauts

00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:11.260
safely back.

00:57:11.260 --> 00:57:16.040
And there's oftentimes
competing kind of objectives

00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:19.935
that have to be
properly dealt with.

00:57:19.935 --> 00:57:25.230
And with that I would
like to close here.

00:57:25.230 --> 00:57:28.059
And if you have any questions
I'd be happy to answer those.

00:57:28.059 --> 00:57:29.600
AUDIENCE: So what
are some strategies

00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:33.140
for dealing with software
failures, where the things that

00:57:33.140 --> 00:57:35.680
go wrong might not be as
predictable as mechanical

00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:38.990
failure where you know what
the faults are going to be?

00:57:38.990 --> 00:57:39.740
KAI GOEBEL: Right.

00:57:39.740 --> 00:57:47.780
So obviously you want to, again,
design out as many as you can.

00:57:47.780 --> 00:57:52.660
We think that
software health is one

00:57:52.660 --> 00:57:57.370
of the next really
emerging, important topics.

00:57:57.370 --> 00:58:00.060
We have already
looked into that.

00:58:00.060 --> 00:58:02.460
You can monitor certain things.

00:58:02.460 --> 00:58:05.950
Right, you can
monitor the number

00:58:05.950 --> 00:58:08.550
of threads, or your
communications.

00:58:08.550 --> 00:58:13.600
And you can monitor memory
usage, and all that kind

00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:18.095
of stuff, and relate that
back to the applications

00:58:18.095 --> 00:58:19.850
that you're running,
and have some sort

00:58:19.850 --> 00:58:23.590
of feeling for whether
things are right or wrong.

00:58:23.590 --> 00:58:25.270
So in that sense
actually you could

00:58:25.270 --> 00:58:29.110
use some of the concepts
that are explained here

00:58:29.110 --> 00:58:33.070
in a mechanical kind of
context also for software.

00:58:33.070 --> 00:58:34.700
That alone will
not get you there.

00:58:34.700 --> 00:58:38.430
So what we have to
do is explore how

00:58:38.430 --> 00:58:44.060
you would go about
autonomous V&amp;V actually.

00:58:44.060 --> 00:58:51.270
Right, so as you have to
implement new routines

00:58:51.270 --> 00:58:56.600
on the fly you have to
perform V&amp;V on the fly also.

00:58:56.600 --> 00:59:00.100
And so there's
some formal methods

00:59:00.100 --> 00:59:03.360
that one can explore
to tackle that,

00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:09.550
but that is definitely a
not completed topic yet.

00:59:09.550 --> 00:59:12.220
AUDIENCE: OK, so how does
your like on board health

00:59:12.220 --> 00:59:14.070
monitoring hardware
look like if you

00:59:14.070 --> 00:59:16.502
want to do the autonomous V&amp;V?

00:59:16.502 --> 00:59:17.710
KAI GOEBEL: How does it what?

00:59:17.710 --> 00:59:18.210
Sorry.

00:59:18.210 --> 00:59:21.000
AUDIENCE: The on board, the
health monitoring hardware,

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:22.410
because everything is automated.

00:59:22.410 --> 00:59:25.590
So what kind of processors,
how many processors

00:59:25.590 --> 00:59:28.806
are you using to run
your health monitoring?

00:59:28.806 --> 00:59:30.180
KAI GOEBEL: For
conceptual things

00:59:30.180 --> 00:59:32.190
you can use whatever
you want, right?

00:59:32.190 --> 00:59:36.800
But if you want to
fly something in space

00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:40.700
it has to be rat
hardened, and usually you

00:59:40.700 --> 00:59:42.710
run some processors
that are 20 years old,

00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:45.810
or something like that.

00:59:45.810 --> 00:59:50.410
So you're not going to get
the state of the art for that.

00:59:50.410 --> 00:59:52.540
AUDIENCE: But the
operations you show

00:59:52.540 --> 00:59:54.760
looked pretty
computation intensive

00:59:54.760 --> 00:59:56.520
if you want to do
that on board, right?

00:59:56.520 --> 00:59:57.470
KAI GOEBEL: Yes.

00:59:57.470 --> 01:00:01.820
And so we will have
to push for making

01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:05.570
more resources available
on board for these things.

01:00:05.570 --> 01:00:06.810
And we expect that they will.

01:00:06.810 --> 01:00:09.920
I mean, clearly
the expectation is

01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:15.470
that more functionality will
be assumed through software,

01:00:15.470 --> 01:00:17.870
and that it's
exponentially growing.

01:00:17.870 --> 01:00:19.720
And I don't see
that the curve will

01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:22.277
be flattening any time soon.

01:00:22.277 --> 01:00:23.360
Well, thank you very much.

01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:24.910
