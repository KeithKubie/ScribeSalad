00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:01.840
- [Instructor] From the very beginning

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:04.490
of English settlement in North America,

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.560
the contrast between the Southern Colonies

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.410
and the Northern Colonies was stark.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.720
Things didn't improve
much when the 13 Colonies

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.610
rebelled in 1776 and became
an independent nation.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.590
Tensions over slavery flared

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.210
during the crafting of
the U.S. Constitution,

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.880
and repeatedly during the 19th Century,

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.960
when compromises in 1820 and 1850

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.370
barely maintained the fragile balance

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.480
between Northern and Southern states.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.400
But in 1860, the wheels finally came off,

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.040
and the Southern states seceded

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.360
from the Union, starting the Civil War.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.520
After more than 80 years of compromise,

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.810
why did the differences
between the North and the South

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.710
finally become
irreconcilable in the 1850s?

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.310
In other videos we've
traced the differences

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.010
and similarities between
the North and South

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.490
from the Colonial Era until the late 1840s

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.610
in terms of economics, social structure,

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.480
and commonly held ideas about slavery.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.710
Let's revisit those
comparisons for the years

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.220
immediately leading up to the Civil War

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.120
and see if we can identify why

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.340
the conflict intensified in the 1850s.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.650
The difference between
the economies of the North

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.300
and South began way back at the outset

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.490
of colonization in North America

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.390
when the cold climate
of the North prevented

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.470
large scale plantation agriculture.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.530
Instead the Northern economy centered

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.260
on trade and manufacturing.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.550
The first and second Industrial Revolution

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.140
turned the Northern economy
into one based on factories,

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.040
where men, women and children
worked for long hours,

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.030
sometimes in dangerous conditions.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.410
In the 1840s the potato famine in Ireland

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.740
and revolutions in Europe
prompted many Irish and German

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.070
immigrants to come to Northern

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.410
cities in search of factory jobs.

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.300
But even though most factory workers

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.230
in the North struggled to make ends meet,

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.140
there was some opportunity
for social mobility,

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.970
to climb the economic ladder.

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.340
Therefore, the North also had a growing

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.710
middle class in the mid-19th Century.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.810
Many in the lower class held out hope

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.040
that they could move out West and start

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.340
a small family farm in order
to become financially stable.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.970
So to recap, the class structure in the

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.860
North looked kind of like this.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.130
A large working class of
laborers, many of them immigrants,

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.870
a middle class of managers
and small business owners,

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.470
and a small upper class of factory owners,

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.760
bankers and successful merchants.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.660
In the South, cultivating
valuable cash crops

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.660
to sell on the national
and international markets

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.790
had always been the center of the economy.

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.140
Cotton had slowly replaced tobacco

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.380
as the number one crop in the South,

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.430
and American cotton
plantations were producing

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.510
nearly 70 percent of the
world's cotton supply by 1860.

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.900
With agriculture working out
so well for plantation owners,

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.170
there was no need to
industrialize as in the North.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.640
All the labor on plantations
was done by enslaved people,

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.640
who had no hope of improving their lot

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.570
in life except by running away.

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.720
There was also a large number of poor

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.570
white farmers who owned no slaves,

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.360
and a few modest planters that owned

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.850
fewer than 10 enslaved people.

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.370
Despite the popular myth
of gigantic plantations

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.990
across the South, only
one-tenth of a percent

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.750
of slaveholders owned
more than 100 people.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.890
The class system in the South was

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.750
extremely rigid and aristocratic,

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.080
not far off from a
medieval feudal society,

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.920
with a handful of wealthy white families

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.960
dominating in each Southern sate.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.810
Wealth was measured in the South

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.940
by the number of enslaved
people a planter owned.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.200
Poorer whites aspired
to buy enslaved people

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.600
and become plantation owners themselves,

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.070
but their prospects of doing so

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.370
were pretty slim by the 1850s.

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.900
Growing cotton quickly depleted the soil,

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.340
and so both large plantation owners

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.750
and whites who dreamed of
becoming large plantation owners

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.550
looked to the West for
new lands to cultivate

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.100
in order to expand the cotton kingdom.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.980
In short, the class structure in

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.250
the South looked a little like this.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.180
A large permanent under
class of enslaved laborers,

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.070
with non-slaveholding whites above

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.940
them in rights and in economic power.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.070
Then there was a small number of planters

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.300
who owned a few enslaved people.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.310
And at the very top was a tiny fraction

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.000
of large planters who owned
more than 100 enslaved people.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.370
So how did these economic
differences lead to tension?

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.420
Well first, there were
tensions over whether

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.750
the economic policy of
the Federal Government

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.620
promoted agriculture or manufacturing.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.100
Things like tariffs and the
expansion of the railroad

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.500
turned into bitter fights
over whether the government

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.970
was prioritizing the needs
of one section or the other.

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.400
And then there was westward expansion.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.100
Both Northerners and
Southerners looked to the West

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.310
for their future economic opportunities,

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.310
and both sides suspected the other

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.160
of trying to suppress their
paths to social mobility.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.340
The ideologies of the North and South

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.890
also diverged sharply in the 1850s.

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.830
In the North, most whites didn't object

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.540
to slavery as it existed in the South,

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.300
but worried about the potential

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.240
expansion of slavery to the West.

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.330
The Free Soil Movement aimed to preserve

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.640
Western lands for small white farmers.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.210
There was also a growing
sense among Northerners

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.740
that the South had too much
power in the Federal Government

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.660
thanks to the Three-Fifths Compromise,

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.760
which granted Southern
states representation

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.240
in Congress for 60 percent
of its disenfranchised

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.970
enslaved population in addition
to its white population.

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.220
This was a fair charge to make.

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:47.370
Many events of the 1850s
like the Fugitive Slave Act,

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.190
which compelled Northern whites

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.950
to assist in capturing runaway slaves,

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.870
the Kansas-Nebraska Act,
which reopened the possibility

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.440
of allowing slavery north of
the Missouri Compromise line,

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.740
and the Supreme Court's
decision in the case

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.560
Dred Scott versus Sandford,

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.550
which claimed that
African-Americans weren't citizens,

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:10.340
convinced Northerners that what
they called the slave power,

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.460
had come to dominate government.

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.080
Consequently, the abolition movement,

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.050
which called for the immediate
end of slavery everywhere,

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:22.950
grew considerably more
mainstream in the 1850s.

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:25.320
Writers like Harriet Beecher Stowe,

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.710
author of the influential abolitionist

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.560
novel Uncle Tom's Cabin,

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.010
activists like Frederick Douglas,

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:34.340
who had escaped from slavery and toured

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.750
the North lecturing about its evils,

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:38.940
and vigilantes like John Brown,

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.700
who led deadly raids on slaveholders,

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.700
dramatized the moral evil of slavery

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:47.940
to a growing audience in this time period.

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.850
In contrast to the North,

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:51.440
white Southerners believed they

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.640
had the Constitution on their side,

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.610
and that Northern attempts
to limit the expansion

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:59.870
of slavery constituted an
assault on their liberty.

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:04.210
In addition, white Southerners
began to craft a proactive

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:07.700
defense of the institution
of slavery in the 1850s.

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:11.510
Instead of treating slavery
like the South's embarrassing,

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:16.190
but necessary, peculiar institution
as they had in the past,

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:17.730
Southern commentators began to

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:20.490
frame slavery as a positive good.

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:21.850
They pointed to the conditions of

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:23.730
immigrants in Northern factories,

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:26.460
who might be injured
in an accident at work,

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:29.590
and then be fired for no
longer being productive.

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:31.430
Slave owners argued that they treated

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:33.580
their enslaved laborers better than

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:37.250
Northern factory owners
treated their wage slaves.

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:41.160
Southern sociologist George
Fitzhugh wrote two books

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:45.500
arguing that slavery was
preferable to the kill or be killed

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.920
environment of unbridled capitalism,

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.100
and that poor whites should be enslaved

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.490
in addition to people of African descent

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:54.220
in order to protect them from being

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:56.170
eaten alive in the free market.

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:58.830
In looking at these economic, social,

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:01.830
and ideological differences
between the North and South,

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:04.290
it's clear that by the 1850s there was

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:07.140
really a clash of cultures going on.

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:10.300
Would the United Stated
be an agricultural nation,

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:12.100
or an industrial one?

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:16.460
One where anyone, no matter
their color or place or birth,

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:17.810
could climb the social ladder,

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:20.230
or one where just a few deserved to

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:22.270
enjoy all the blessings of liberty?

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:24.600
In 1860, these questions would

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.753
propel the country into civil war.
