00:00:00.474 --> 00:00:02.342
- [Voiceover] In order to
connect to the internet,

00:00:02.342 --> 00:00:05.360
dedicated computers are
kept in a server room.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:06.615
To prevent overheating,

00:00:06.615 --> 00:00:08.460
the denisty of computers in a server room

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.675
must not exceed 2.1 computers

00:00:12.675 --> 00:00:14.637
per cubic foot.

00:00:14.637 --> 00:00:18.259
One meter is about 3.28 feet.

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:19.895
So they're converting linear meters

00:00:19.895 --> 00:00:20.800
to linear feet.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:21.718
They're not telling us how many

00:00:21.718 --> 00:00:23.075
that one cubic meter,

00:00:23.075 --> 00:00:24.934
they're not saying how many cubic feet

00:00:24.934 --> 00:00:25.792
is one cubic meter.

00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:26.895
So, I suspect we're going to have

00:00:26.895 --> 00:00:28.254
to figure that out.

00:00:28.254 --> 00:00:29.577
Which of the following densities

00:00:29.577 --> 00:00:31.040
is equal to the maximum number

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.840
of computers per,

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.178
computers per cubic,

00:00:35.178 --> 00:00:36.401
cubic,

00:00:36.401 --> 00:00:38.794
cubic meter.

00:00:38.794 --> 00:00:40.339
So how would we think about this?

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:41.917
Well, and if you're taking the SAT

00:00:41.917 --> 00:00:42.834
you might not have time

00:00:42.834 --> 00:00:44.460
to draw a nice diagram,

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.539
but this is literally

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.781
what I am visualizing in my head

00:00:47.781 --> 00:00:50.300
when I first read that problem,

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.250
is I imagine a cubic meter.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.236
I imagine a cubic meter

00:00:54.236 --> 00:00:56.510
and along each of the three dimensions,

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.090
in the space we know of,

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.734
the three dimensional space,

00:00:59.734 --> 00:01:01.294
a cubic meter,

00:01:01.294 --> 00:01:01.883
we're going,

00:01:01.883 --> 00:01:03.012
it's going to be one meter

00:01:03.012 --> 00:01:04.032
in this dimension

00:01:04.032 --> 00:01:06.029
by one meter in this dimension

00:01:06.029 --> 00:01:07.898
by one meter in that dimension.

00:01:07.898 --> 00:01:09.710
That's what a cubic meter is.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.011
Now, one meter in this dimension,

00:01:11.011 --> 00:01:13.518
that's going to be 3.28 feet.

00:01:13.518 --> 00:01:15.073
So, maybe,

00:01:15.073 --> 00:01:16.454
I'm not obviously drawing it perfectly,

00:01:16.454 --> 00:01:17.883
but that's maybe a foot.

00:01:17.883 --> 00:01:19.067
That's another foot,

00:01:19.067 --> 00:01:20.827
actually I drew them too small.

00:01:20.827 --> 00:01:21.935
That's a foot,

00:01:21.935 --> 00:01:23.071
that's a foot

00:01:23.071 --> 00:01:24.291
and that's a foot.

00:01:24.291 --> 00:01:25.567
So you have one, two, three

00:01:25.567 --> 00:01:26.288
and then a little bit,

00:01:26.288 --> 00:01:27.890
a little more than a quarter of a foot.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.573
So that's 3.28 feet

00:01:29.573 --> 00:01:31.094
and then, let's see,

00:01:31.094 --> 00:01:32.045
one foot,

00:01:32.045 --> 00:01:33.474
two foot,

00:01:33.474 --> 00:01:34.612
three foot.

00:01:34.612 --> 00:01:37.572
Then you have one foot,

00:01:37.572 --> 00:01:38.790
one foot,

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:39.928
two foot

00:01:39.928 --> 00:01:41.170
and three foot.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.213
And so a cubic foot will actually look

00:01:43.213 --> 00:01:44.885
something like this.

00:01:44.885 --> 00:01:48.566
A cubic foot would look
something like this.

00:01:48.566 --> 00:01:50.830
So, if you could put 2.1 computers

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:51.666
per cubic foot.

00:01:51.666 --> 00:01:53.209
If you could put 2.1 computers

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:55.751
in this small cubic foot right over here,

00:01:55.751 --> 00:01:57.493
surely you're going to
be able to put a lot more

00:01:57.493 --> 00:02:00.744
than 2.1 computers in the cubic meter.

00:02:00.744 --> 00:02:01.592
And just off of that,

00:02:01.592 --> 00:02:03.123
you can rule out these two choices

00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:06.072
because these two are less than 2.1.

00:02:06.072 --> 00:02:07.872
But how would you actually calculate it?

00:02:07.872 --> 00:02:10.624
Well, you could just multiply this volume,

00:02:10.624 --> 00:02:11.626
a cubic meter,

00:02:11.626 --> 00:02:12.516
you could just,

00:02:12.516 --> 00:02:13.483
you can,

00:02:13.483 --> 00:02:15.313
to figure out how many cubic feet it is,

00:02:15.313 --> 00:02:17.530
you can just multiply by the dimensions

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.191
in terms of feet.

00:02:19.191 --> 00:02:22.650
So this right here is
going to be 3.28 feet

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:23.672
in that dimension.

00:02:23.672 --> 00:02:27.026
It's going to be 3.28 feet high

00:02:27.026 --> 00:02:30.022
and it's going to be 3.28 feet,

00:02:30.022 --> 00:02:32.983
I guess if we call this
dimension, maybe, deep.

00:02:32.983 --> 00:02:35.130
And, so what's the volume right over here?

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.612
Well, it's going to be
3.28 times 3.28 times 3.28.

00:02:39.612 --> 00:02:44.612
So the volume here is 3.28 to
the third power feet cubed.

00:02:47.481 --> 00:02:48.560
Cubic feet

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.530
and this is how many cubic feet you have

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.183
per cubic meter

00:02:52.183 --> 00:02:54.759
because this whole thing
is also a cubic meter.

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:56.942
Now, so this is the number of cubic feet

00:02:56.942 --> 00:02:58.405
per cubic meter

00:02:58.405 --> 00:02:59.938
and if you want to know how many computers

00:02:59.938 --> 00:03:00.738
you can fit in that,

00:03:00.738 --> 00:03:02.701
you can then just multiply by the density

00:03:02.701 --> 00:03:04.001
and cubic feet.

00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:06.821
So, times 2.1,

00:03:06.821 --> 00:03:08.876
I'll write comp for computers,

00:03:08.876 --> 00:03:11.975
computers per cubic feet.

00:03:11.975 --> 00:03:13.438
And you can see that these units

00:03:13.438 --> 00:03:14.622
are going to work out.

00:03:14.622 --> 00:03:16.980
You have cubic feet divided by cubic feet

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.036
and if you multiply them

00:03:18.036 --> 00:03:21.822
you're going to get
3.28 to the third power

00:03:21.822 --> 00:03:23.865
times 2.1,

00:03:23.865 --> 00:03:25.755
that's this times this,

00:03:25.755 --> 00:03:27.823
computers,

00:03:27.823 --> 00:03:31.538
computers per meters cubed

00:03:31.538 --> 00:03:33.174
or per cubic meter.

00:03:33.174 --> 00:03:35.520
So this is the maximum number of computers

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.039
per cubic meter, right over here.

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:39.918
Now, we could try to solve this by hand

00:03:39.918 --> 00:03:41.114
or solve it someway,

00:03:41.114 --> 00:03:41.963
but we can estimate it

00:03:41.963 --> 00:03:43.582
because these two remaining choices

00:03:43.582 --> 00:03:44.772
are quite different.

00:03:44.772 --> 00:03:46.431
What's 3.28 to the third power

00:03:46.431 --> 00:03:47.953
going to be, roughly?

00:03:47.953 --> 00:03:50.263
Well, three to the third power is 27.

00:03:50.263 --> 00:03:53.200
So this thing is going
to be larger than 27

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.940
and if you multiply
something larger than 27

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.791
by something larger than two,

00:03:57.791 --> 00:04:00.507
you're going to get
something larger than 54.

00:04:00.507 --> 00:04:02.471
So this thing is definitely
going to be larger,

00:04:02.471 --> 00:04:04.629
way larger than 6.89.

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:05.801
And it's completely reasonable,

00:04:05.801 --> 00:04:06.788
these numbers look right,

00:04:06.788 --> 00:04:08.309
that 3.28 to the third power

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:09.319
times 2.1,

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:12.465
actually would be around 74.1.

00:04:12.465 --> 00:04:13.904
And so this is definitely,

00:04:13.904 --> 00:04:15.369
this is definitely the choice

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:16.319
that I would pick.

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:17.143
Now, if you had a lot of time

00:04:17.143 --> 00:04:18.165
you could multiply this out,

00:04:18.165 --> 00:04:18.838
use your calculator,

00:04:18.838 --> 00:04:19.778
but based on these choices

00:04:19.778 --> 00:04:20.986
you could actually just deduce

00:04:20.986 --> 00:04:22.681
that this is going to be the right choice.

00:04:22.681 --> 00:04:23.958
This choice is interesting

00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.560
because if you look at it

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.046
this is,

00:04:27.046 --> 00:04:31.144
this is kind of an answer to pick

00:04:31.144 --> 00:04:33.605
if you forgot to convert to cubic,

00:04:33.605 --> 00:04:36.368
if you forgot to convert
how many cubic feet

00:04:36.368 --> 00:04:37.424
are per cubic meter

00:04:37.424 --> 00:04:40.257
and if you just kept things
in linear meters and feet

00:04:40.257 --> 00:04:41.325
because then you might say,

00:04:41.325 --> 00:04:43.786
okay, if I have 2.1
computers per cubic foot

00:04:43.786 --> 00:04:44.819
and then if you just say,

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:48.406
hey, well I have 3.28
as many feet per meter,

00:04:48.406 --> 00:04:49.834
not thinking in terms of cubic feet

00:04:49.834 --> 00:04:50.763
and cubic meters,

00:04:50.763 --> 00:04:52.922
that if you take 2.1 times 3.28,

00:04:52.922 --> 00:04:54.257
that's probably this choice here.

00:04:54.257 --> 00:04:55.221
I haven't multiplied it out,

00:04:55.221 --> 00:04:57.125
but that looks like 6.89.

00:04:57.125 --> 00:04:59.017
So that's where this answer

00:04:59.017 --> 00:05:01.055
actually came from.
