00:00:07.736 --> 00:00:09.506
As the warrior slept,

00:00:09.506 --> 00:00:12.056
a snake coiled around his face.

00:00:12.056 --> 00:00:15.116
Instead of a threat, his wife saw an omen–

00:00:15.116 --> 00:00:20.086
a fearsome power that would lead
her husband to either glory or doom.

00:00:20.086 --> 00:00:22.981
For now, however, he was only a slave –

00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:25.321
one of millions taken from the territories

00:00:25.321 --> 00:00:27.951
conquered by Rome to work the mines,

00:00:27.951 --> 00:00:29.181
till the fields,

00:00:29.181 --> 00:00:31.991
or fight for the crowd’s entertainment.

00:00:31.991 --> 00:00:34.851
A nomadic Thracian from 
what is now Bulgaria,

00:00:34.851 --> 00:00:38.811
he had served in the Roman Army 
but was imprisoned for desertion.

00:00:38.811 --> 00:00:42.731
His name was Spartacus.

00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:47.083
Spartacus had been brought to Capua 
by Batiatus, a lanista,

00:00:47.083 --> 00:00:49.283
or trainer of gladiators.

00:00:49.283 --> 00:00:53.877
And life at the ludus, or gladiator 
school, was unforgiving.

00:00:53.877 --> 00:00:56.675
New recruits were forced to swear an oath

00:00:56.675 --> 00:01:01.555
“to be burned, to be bound, to be beaten, 
and to be killed by the sword,”

00:01:01.555 --> 00:01:04.505
and to obey their master’s will 
without question.

00:01:04.505 --> 00:01:08.425
But even harsh discipline couldn’t 
break Spartacus’s spirit.

00:01:08.425 --> 00:01:12.865
In 73 BCE, Spartacus led 73 other slaves

00:01:12.865 --> 00:01:17.483
to seize knives and skewers from the 
kitchen and fight their way out,

00:01:17.483 --> 00:01:21.492
hijacking a wagon of gladiator equipment 
along the way.

00:01:21.492 --> 00:01:23.459
They were done fighting for others–

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:26.499
now, they fought for their freedom.

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:27.949
When the news reached Rome,

00:01:27.949 --> 00:01:32.039
the Senate was too busy with wars in 
Spain and the Pontic Empire

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:34.859
to worry about some unruly slaves.

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:39.719
Unconcerned, praetor Claudius Glaber took 
an army of three thousand men

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:42.299
to the rebel’s refuge at Mount Vesuvius,

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.599
and blocked off the only passage 
up the mountain.

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:48.639
All that remained was to wait and 
starve them out–

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:50.419
or so he thought.

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:51.447
In the dead of night,

00:01:51.447 --> 00:01:56.277
the rebels lowered themselves down the 
cliffside on ropes made from vines,

00:01:56.277 --> 00:01:59.627
and flanked Glaber’s unguarded camp.

00:01:59.627 --> 00:02:04.197
Thus began the legend of Rome’s 
defiant gladiator.

00:02:04.197 --> 00:02:06.235
As news of the rebellion spread,

00:02:06.235 --> 00:02:09.005
its ranks swelled with escaped slaves,

00:02:09.005 --> 00:02:12.235
deserting soldiers, and hungry peasants.

00:02:12.235 --> 00:02:13.645
Many were untrained,

00:02:13.645 --> 00:02:16.865
but Spartacus’s clever tactics 
transformed them

00:02:16.865 --> 00:02:19.505
into an effective guerrilla force.

00:02:19.505 --> 00:02:22.599
A second Roman expedition led by praetor
Varinius,

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.545
was ambushed while the officer bathed.

00:02:25.545 --> 00:02:27.735
To elude the remaining Roman forces,

00:02:27.735 --> 00:02:31.845
the rebels used their enemy’s corpses as
decoy guards,

00:02:31.845 --> 00:02:36.195
stealing Varinius’s own horse 
to aid their escape.

00:02:36.195 --> 00:02:41.070
Thanks to his inspiring victories 
and policy of distributing spoils equally,

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.700
Spartacus continued attracting followers,

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.630
and gained control of villages

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.470
where new weapons could be forged.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.060
The Romans soon realized they were 
no longer facing ragtag fugitives,

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.710
and in the spring of 72 BCE,

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:00.280
the Senate retaliated with 
the full force of two legions.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.168
The rebels left victorious,

00:03:02.168 --> 00:03:04.548
but many lives were lost in the battle,

00:03:04.548 --> 00:03:08.178
including Spartacus’ lieutenant Crixus.

00:03:08.178 --> 00:03:11.354
To honor him, 
Spartacus held funeral games,

00:03:11.354 --> 00:03:17.624
forcing his Roman prisoners to play the 
role his fellow rebels had once endured.

00:03:17.624 --> 00:03:19.852
By the end of 72 BCE,

00:03:19.852 --> 00:03:25.052
Spartacus’ army was a massive force of 
roughly 120,000 members.

00:03:25.052 --> 00:03:28.232
But those numbers proved 
difficult to manage.

00:03:28.232 --> 00:03:30.102
With the path to the Alps clear,

00:03:30.102 --> 00:03:33.102
Spartacus wanted to march 
beyond Rome’s borders,

00:03:33.102 --> 00:03:35.422
where his followers would be free.

00:03:35.426 --> 00:03:38.436
But his vast army had grown brash.

00:03:38.436 --> 00:03:40.547
Many wanted to continue pillaging,

00:03:40.547 --> 00:03:44.367
while others dreamed of 
marching on Rome itself.

00:03:44.367 --> 00:03:47.377
In the end, the rebel army turned south–

00:03:47.377 --> 00:03:50.937
forgoing what would be their 
last chance at freedom.

00:03:50.937 --> 00:03:56.197
Meanwhile, Marcus Licinius Crassus 
had assumed control of the war.

00:03:56.197 --> 00:03:58.235
As Rome’s wealthiest citizen,

00:03:58.235 --> 00:04:01.535
he pursued Spartacus 
with eight new legions,

00:04:01.535 --> 00:04:05.645
eventually trapping the rebels 
in the toe of Italy.

00:04:05.645 --> 00:04:07.842
After failed attempts to build rafts,

00:04:07.842 --> 00:04:10.522
and a stinging betrayal by local pirates,

00:04:10.522 --> 00:04:14.612
the rebels made a desperate run 
to break through Crassus’s lines–

00:04:14.612 --> 00:04:16.232
but it was no use.

00:04:16.232 --> 00:04:19.592
Roman reinforcements were returning 
from the Pontic wars,

00:04:19.592 --> 00:04:23.312
and the rebels’ ranks and 
spirits were broken.

00:04:23.312 --> 00:04:27.783
In 71 BCE, they made their last stand.

00:04:27.783 --> 00:04:33.359
Spartacus nearly managed to reach Crassus 
before being cut down by centurions.

00:04:33.359 --> 00:04:34.949
His army was destroyed,

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:39.289
and 6000 captives were crucified 
along the Appian Way–

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:43.179
a haunting demonstration 
of Roman authority.

00:04:43.179 --> 00:04:44.567
Crassus won the war,

00:04:44.567 --> 00:04:48.337
but it is not his legacy which echoes 
through the centuries.

00:04:48.337 --> 00:04:49.777
Thousands of years later,

00:04:49.777 --> 00:04:53.487
the name of the slave who made the 
world’s mightiest empire tremble

00:04:53.487 --> 00:04:55.737
has become synonymous with freedom–

00:04:55.737 --> 00:04:58.397
and the courage to fight for it.
