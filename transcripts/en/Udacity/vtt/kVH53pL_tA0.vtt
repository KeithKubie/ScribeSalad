00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.420
So the answer to this question is that

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:06.570
exons are considered part of protein coding DNA because

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.080
exons are eventually turned into protein. And the

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.510
same is true for translated sequence between start and

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.180
stop codons. They're all part of protein coding

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.820
DNA because the sequences that make up that DNA

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.150
are eventually turned into protein. And these other

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.930
reasons like introns, which are spliced out of MRNAs,

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.570
promoter regions which are responsible for initiating

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.870
transcription, and untranslated sequences, that are transcribed

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:35.620
in part of the MRNA, but outside of the start and stop codons are all

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.290
considered part on non-coding DNA. So hopefully

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.720
if you truly understand the concepts of coding.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.170
DNA versus noncoding DNA. You will understand

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.350
why each of these types of DNA sequence

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.360
would be categories or classified as

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.550
either protein coding or noncoding. If you're

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.820
having any trouble with these concepts. Check out the forums and see what some

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.440
of your classmates have to say. If I notice there's a lot of

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.400
trouble, I'll try to post some clarifying

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.750
information there or in the instructor's notes.
