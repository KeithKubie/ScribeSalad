00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.860
Right here I have graphed
part of the graph of y

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:05.360
is equal to 1/x.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.890
And what I'm curious about
is the area under this curve

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:13.890
and above the x-axis between
x equals 1 and infinity.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:19.080
So I want to figure out
this area right over here.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.810
So let's try to do it.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.180
So we could set this up as an
improper integral going from 1

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:32.530
to infinity of 1/x dx.

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:38.110
Well once again-- actually, let
me do that same yellow color.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.270
I like that more-- we can
view this as the limit as n

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.830
approaches infinity of
the integral from 1 to n

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:54.470
of 1/x dx, which we can
write as the limit as n

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.870
approaches infinity of
the antiderivative of 1/x,

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.980
which is the natural log
of the absolute value of x.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.500
So this is going to
be the natural log

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.930
of the absolute value of x.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.340
And the absolute value of x
won't really matter so much.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.714
We could just say
x because we're

00:01:10.714 --> 00:01:12.210
dealing with
positive values of x.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.126
But I'll just write it
down as the natural log

00:01:14.126 --> 00:01:19.300
of the absolute value of x
between x is 1 and x is n.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.920
And so this is going to
be equal to the limit

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.260
as n approaches infinity
of-- you evaluate this at n,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.307
so you're going to
get the natural log--

00:01:29.307 --> 00:01:30.890
I could write the
absolute value of n,

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.681
but we know that n is
going to be positive.

00:01:32.681 --> 00:01:34.570
So we could just write
the natural log of n

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.820
minus the natural log of
the absolute value of 1,

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.170
or the natural log of 1.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.810
Natural log of 1 is just a 0.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.100
e to the 0-th power
is equal to 1.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.610
So this boils down
to the limit as n

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.430
approaches infinity of
the natural log of n.

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.000
Now this is interesting.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.010
Natural log function
just keeps getting

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:58.900
larger and larger and larger.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.610
The natural log function keeps
growing and growing and growing

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.030
like this, albeit at a
slower and slower pace,

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.330
but it keeps growing.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.870
The limit as n approaches
infinity of the natural log

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:14.940
of n is just equal to infinity.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.670
So here we do not
have a finite area.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.370
This is an infinite.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.040
This is an infinite area.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.090
It's interesting.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.220
When this function
decreased faster--

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.960
when it was 1 over x squared--
we had a finite area.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.080
Now we have an infinite area.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.990
And so we would say that this
integral right over here,

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.433
this improper
integral, is divergent.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.520
And we're done.
