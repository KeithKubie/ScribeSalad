closer to them wanting to be like DC in
 

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:50.240
closer to them wanting to be like DC in
the same way that Wonder Woman in some

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:50.250
the same way that Wonder Woman in some
 

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:51.889
the same way that Wonder Woman in some
ways felt like maybe that was trying to

00:15:51.889 --> 00:15:51.899

00:15:51.899 --> 00:15:53.329
ways felt like maybe that was trying to
be a little more Marvel like we're

00:15:53.329 --> 00:15:53.339

seeing a bait-and-switch here because I

00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:54.660
seeing a bait-and-switch here because I
 

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:56.090
seeing a bait-and-switch here because I
think both sides have gotten a little

00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:56.100
think both sides have gotten a little
 

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:57.769

maybe Winter Soldier closest but even
 

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.210
maybe Winter Soldier closest but even
Winter Soldier had more comedy and to

00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:35.220
Winter Soldier had more comedy and to
 

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:36.740
Winter Soldier had more comedy and to
kind of break it up a little bit it's

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:36.750
kind of break it up a little bit it's
 

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:37.999
kind of break it up a little bit it's

00:16:38.009 --> 00:16:40.040
like this one really kind of seemed like
in its own universe and sort of its own

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:40.050
in its own universe and sort of its own
 

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:43.160
in its own universe and sort of its own
style but to deal with great moral

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:43.170

what's building up with this villain and
everything I mean like this could have

00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:36.280
everything I mean like this could have
 

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.610
everything I mean like this could have
been just this grand epic bout where the

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:38.620
been just this grand epic bout where the
 

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:42.090
been just this grand epic bout where the
visuals match you know like the drama

00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:42.100

no there isn't just the logical reason
just from the filmmaking perspective of

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:19.990
just from the filmmaking perspective of
 

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:22.200
just from the filmmaking perspective of
why it wouldn't work in the sulky I know

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:22.210
why it wouldn't work in the sulky I know

specific reason you know I know but
 

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:36.000
specific reason you know I know but
