00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.220
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: From the Library
of Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.010
&gt;&gt; Cameron Barr: Good
afternoon everybody.

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:14.700
Welcome. I'm Cameron Barr, Managing
Editor for news and features

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.890
at the Washington Post,
which is a charter sponsor

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.180
of the National Book Festival.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.360
First, a word of gratitude to
the cochairman of the festival,

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.920
David Rubenstein and the many
other sponsors who've made this

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.320
event possible.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.650 position:56%
If you would like to add your
support, please note the information

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.030
in the program or the app.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.440
We will have some time today for
questions and I've been asked

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.990
to remind you that those who
query are distinguished guest.

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.670
We'll be videod for
the Library's archives.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.700
Jon Meacham is a frequent
speaker at this festival,

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.110
reflection of his eminence as
a journalist and historian.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.070
I hadn't met him until yesterday,
so I consulted Don Graham,

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.500
who employed him for
many years at Newsweek.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.780
Don pointed out that Jon
is a former boy wonder.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.590
He became National Affairs
editor of Newsweek at 26.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.090
And by the age of 37, he
had been named its editor.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.190
Those were not always
fun years at Newsweek,

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.060 position:56%
especially in the time preceding the
Graham sale of the magazine in 2010,

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.190
but Jon excelled even in adversity.

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.590
In Don's words, he was a wise,
thoughtful and successful editor

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.020
of Newsweek under impossible
circumstances.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.000
As Jon's colleagues would tell
you, even in the earliest years

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.810
of his ascent, he was wise beyond
his years, much more capable

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.780
of wry wit and ironic
detachment, then you're typical

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.540
as we would say today millennial.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.560 position:56%
Week after week, Jon would replenish
the building with new ideas,

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.920
very often drawn from his
deep knowledge of history

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.170
and religion and literature.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.860
Sometimes boy wonders but are--

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.960
fail to deliver on the promise
they exhibited at the dawn

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.920
of their careers, not Jon Meacham.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.420
His passage from journalism
to book writing

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.420
and publishing has been
marked by distinction,

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.770 position:56%
the success of his 2004 book,
Franklin and Winston, an examination

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.600
of the friendship of Churchill
and Roosevelt helped him to emerge

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.420
as a public intellectual.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.850
American Lion: Andrew Jackson

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.490
in the White House was awarded the
2009 Pulitzer Prize for Biography.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.670
More recently, Jon's book, Thomas
Jefferson: The Art of Power was

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.050
on the Times and the Posts
best books of the year lists.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.150
Jon is here today to talk
about Destiny and Power:

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.590
The American Odyssey of
George Herbert Walker Bush.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.240
Sometimes-- Surprisingly intimate
look had sometimes underestimated

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.460
occupant of the Oval Office.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.880 position:56%
My colleague, Carlos Lozada the Post
non fiction book critic wrote that,

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.660
"it pulls off a neat trick.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.220
It completes the historical
rehabilitation of its subject

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.970
by deepening rather than upending,

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.430
common perceptions of
the 41st president."

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.680
It is a book that acts-- asks us
to consider as we witness a contest

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.060
between two widely disliked
contenders for the presidency,

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.920
the importance of personal
honor in our leaders.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.510
Ladies and gentlemen, Jon Meacham.

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:34.910
[ Applause ]

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.210
&gt;&gt; Jon Meacham: Thank you, Cameron.

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:37.510
I appreciate that.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:38.810
A great deal.

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.340
This is-- I feel a little
bit more warmly received

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.070
at this particular book festival
than I did eight years ago

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.020
when I was here to talk
about Andrew Jackson,

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.670
who's at a rough couple
of months, whom I know.

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:57.100
But I was on my way to
give my talk about Jackson.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.880
And a woman ran up to me,
which doesn't happen enough

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:06.270
as a basic rule, and said,
"Oh my God, it's you."

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.150
And I said, "Well, yes," you know?

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.520
Existentially speaking,
that's hard to argue with.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.070
She said, "We wait right here, I
want you to sign your new book."

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.680
And I said, "Yes, ma'am."

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.530
Hand the guide, she brought back
John Grisham's latest novel.

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:30.570
So whenever I think I am a boy
wonder who survived boy wonderhood,

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.190
I remember that there's a
woman somewhere in America

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.570
with a forge copy of
the Runaway Jury.

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:46.920
So, memento mori as the medievalist
called it, I'm thrilled to be here.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.600
Thank you all for being here.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.710
you are the reason,
many of the reasons

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.100
that a lot of us do what we do.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.510
In the lonely hours of foot
noting and trying to make sure

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.500
that you get everything right,
you're the ones on our minds

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.180
to make sure we maintain our
covenant with you in terms

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.600
of creating compelling, hopefully
compelling narrative non fiction.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.000
I don't know if you
all have noticed.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.520
There's a presidential race
going on at the moment.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:27.520
I just want to say right off the
top, the movement in 25 years

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.470 position:56%
from George Herbert Walker Bush as
the Republican nominee for president

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:37.010
to the incumbent Republican
nominee for president,

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:46.110
George Bush who could not talk
about himself do Donald Trump

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.080
to quote Henry Adams
disproves Darwin.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.150
[ Laughter and Applause ]

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:52.950
So--

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:57.190
[ Applause ]

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:58.880
That's where we are.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.770
That's where we are.

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:07.570
My view of President Bush is that
culturally and temperamentally.

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:09.850
And this is not a nostalgic point.

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:13.370
Culturally and temperamentally,
he has more in common

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:17.960 position:56%
with the founding fathers than he
does with this political generation.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.990
It's-- does not mean he's a
perfect man, we always learn more

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.310 position:56%
from centers than we do from saints.

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:27.430
He was driven by a consuming
ambition to control the fates

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:31.020
and destinies of millions
even billions of people.

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.370
He made compromises along the
way and we'll talk about those.

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:38.290
But at the end of the
day, in his heart,

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:42.950
he was about honor
and service and duty.

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:47.170
He believed at every point that
he wanted those of us who came

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:52.720
after him to say that he had
always put the country first.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.550
And I think of fair minded judgment
suggest that he came as close

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:59.580
as any mortal can do to doing that.

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.730
And again, we'll talk about that.

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:08.130
Now, the history of this book is
somewhat interesting to you all,

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:09.850
but because you're here,
it means you're part

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:11.540
of the broad dork caucus.

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:16.590
And so, I hope you have your cards.

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:21.150
Yeah. You get free
library cards and you have

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:25.610
to watch this band in
the doctor's office.

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:31.440
But I think the key thing to
understand about him comes

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.910
from two biographical moments.

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:35.210
And so, I want to start there.

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:41.570
On June 12th, 1924, he was
born in Milton, Massachusetts,

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:44.290
18 years later as a
senior at Andover,

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:47.310
Philips Andover Academy,
three things happened.

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:51.360
He turns 18 years old,
he graduates from Andover

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:56.870 position:56%
and he joins the United States Navy
becoming the youngest flying officer

00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:58.690
in the navy.

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:02.910
He had told-- he told me that
he very much wanted to go

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:06.880
in to the service actually
right after Pearl Harbor.

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:09.890
He looked in to joining the
Royal Canadian Air Force

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:12.680
because you could get in to
the Royal Canadian Air Force

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.290 position:56%
without graduating from high school.

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:19.880
He-- his father prevailed on him
to wait another six months or so.

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:24.890
In his inimitable way when I asked
him, "Why was the impulse there

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:26.920
so soon after Pearl Harbor?"

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:30.550
President Bush said, "It was a red,
white and blue thing, you know?

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:33.470
Your country is attacked,
you get in the fight."

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:38.390
He-- On September 2nd,
1944 he's flying a mission

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:43.640 position:56%
over the Bonin Islands over
Chichijima to take out a radio tower

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:47.600
and communications and supply point
going back to the home islands.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:52.740 position:56%
Ferocious Japanese flock the plane,
the torpedo of injure bomber is hit,

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:56.000
the wings of the plane go up
and flames, the cockpit fills

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.520
with smoke, he realizes that he's
going down, but he keeps going.

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:03.620
He keeps going over the
island to take out the tower.

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:07.380
He goes back out to see,
he tells his two crewmates

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:10.050
to hit the silk, to bail out.

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:12.880
He turns the plane so
that they can do that,

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:15.620 position:56%
he turns back and then he bails out.

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:19.430
At this point, tragedy
almost broke out.

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:22.720
If you just bail out of a
plane, if you think about it,

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:26.560
the plane doesn't stop,
so the plane keeps going.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:31.100
He gashes his head on the
tail of the plane, another six

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:33.520
or eight inches and he probably
would have been decapitated.

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:36.370
And that would have been
the end of the story.

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:37.990
He plunges deep in the Pacific,

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:42.850 position:56%
his life unfortunately has fallen
off near by, he flaps into the raft,

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:46.320
he cries, he retches
up the seawater.

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:50.110
He realizes that his two
crewmates have not made it.

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:55.080
And at some point today,
in Maine, they're in Maine

00:09:55.080 --> 00:10:00.980
for another two weeks, he will
think about Ted White and Delaney,

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:06.770
who were the two men who lost
their lives that day in his care.

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:13.960
He was 20 years old and had two
other men's lives in his hands.

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.470
I think the further we come
away from that culture,

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:18.970
the farther we come away
from that generation.

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:22.190
It's difficult to remember
the immensity

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:27.320
of that responsibility we
put on remarkably young men.

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:30.030
One of the many moments, the
president cried in the course

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:31.400
of our interviews for this book.

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.930
I interviewed him for
nine years for this.

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:36.260
Sometimes it was like the
world's worst WaspBane [phonetic]

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:37.560
wasp therapy.

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:38.860
He would cry.

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:43.560
I would cry and then
we change the subject.

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:48.740
You know, most of our debates were
vermouth or, you know, anyway.

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:53.120
The-- I asked him, you know,
what did you learn from this.

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:56.900
And he said, the chief question
that came out of his mind

00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:01.740
about the war experience
was why was I spared?

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:03.430
Why was I spared?

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:09.720
I submit to you that in many ways,
George H.W. Bush's frenetic journey

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:17.110 position:56%
from the autumn of 1944 really on to
this hour to some extent is driven

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:26.740
by his eagerness, his need to prove
that he was worthy of being spared

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:29.310
when others not, that he had

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:33.560
to prove himself worthy
of their sacrifice.

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.770
It's an elemental drama.

00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:41.300
And I believe deeply that that's
a big part of what has driven him.

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:44.660
He came back to it in different
times during the interviews,

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:49.160
always with tears, always sort
of late in a conversation.

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:53.990
And my-- you know, the
other thing about his speed

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:58.300
in life is he has always
been moving rapidly.

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:01.640
This is a man who could play
18 holes of golf in 32 minutes.

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:06.240
I played with him once and my
excuse was I was made nervous

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:09.650 position:56%
by secret guys with submachine guns.

00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:13.860
That's a lot to blame for
my game, but it's there.

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:18.080
But it was a frenetic journey
forward, always moving.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:21.170
In 1980 when he was running
against Ronald Reagan

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:25.660
for the Republican nomination,
Bush was so excitable

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:26.960
that he shook the hand

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:30.510
of a department store
manikin in a department.

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:36.010
Now, Lyndon Jonson would have
tried to register that manikin.

00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:37.310
[ Laughter ]

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:45.100
And God only knows what Bill
Clinton might have done.

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:47.860
So, always head long,
always looking forward,

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:52.160
always moving to the next thing,
looking forward, looking forward.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:55.930
I've never met a man
that level of politics

00:12:55.930 --> 00:13:01.800
with so little interest actually
in how history would view him.

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.790
He believe that he got some
things right, some things wrong

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:08.150
and that people like me and
those who come after me will have

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:10.170
to make our best decisions.

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:12.630
And there's a level
of confidence in that.

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:18.210
I would also submit that the
values and the vision in many ways,

00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:24.740 position:56%
the character and the ambient
dignity that the bush family brought

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:28.190
to our national politics
is something that we are

00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:35.170 position:56%
in woefully short supply as we enter
the fall of 2016 and recovering some

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:41.840
of that dignity will be one step
toward a saner political life.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:45.130
The second thing that affected
him deeply was the loss

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:48.060
of his daughter, Robin in 1953.

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:49.550
They lost her to leukemia.

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:51.610
She'd born in 1949.

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:56.420
George W was born in 1946, Jeb has
just been born in January I think

00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:59.990
of 1953, Robin was four years old.

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:03.270
The Bushes had never
heard the word leukemia

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:05.030
until the heard the diagnosis

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:08.120
in the Midland Pediatrician's
Office in Texas.

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:11.800
Remember they'd come from
Texas after Yale in 1948.

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:15.660
When they moved to Odessa, Texas
first, Mrs. Bush, his mother

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:19.790
and Rye was so convinced that
they'd move to the frontier

00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:23.130
that she would send her
daughter boxes of soap,

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:27.770
because she didn't
the Texas had any.

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:31.980
They moved to Midland, they get
the diagnosis, the doctors says

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:37.480 position:56%
with all sincerity, I think the
thing to do is simply take her home,

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:41.130
make her comfortable and
she'll be gone in a few months.

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:44.930
George Bush being George
Bush could not accept that.

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:49.420
He walks outside, gets on payphone
and calls his uncle John Walker

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:52.720
who is the head of Memorial
Sloan Kettering in New York,

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:56.140
Dr. Walker says, bring her
up, we'll do what we can.

00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:59.000
She survived through some
very difficult treatments

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.120
through October, Columbus
day weekend of 1953.

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:09.620
It was the great cataclysmic
crisis of the Bush marriage

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:12.440
and the Bush family life.

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:15.980
It brought them closer
together as you all may know,

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:20.540
many couples who lose
a child drift apart.

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:27.060
Interestingly Mrs. Bush was strong
when President Bush was weak,

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:29.780 position:56%
and he was weak when she was strong.

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:34.630
He could not stand watching
Robin be treated in the hospital,

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:38.750
he couldn't stand the shots, he
couldn't stand seeing her in pain.

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:43.640
So he would bolt out of the
room leaving Barbara the order

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:47.200
and the love in that
hospital room in that hour.

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:51.520
After Robin died, it
was President Bush

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:56.540
who would hold Mrs. Bush all night
as she cried and sobbed for month

00:15:56.540 --> 00:16:03.900 position:56%
after month after month as she tried
to cope with this unimaginable loss.

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:07.750
So I also asked President Bush
in the course of doing this,

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:10.420
what did the death
of Robin teach you?

00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:17.870 position:56%
And he said without hesitation, that
life is unpredictable and fragile,

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:20.830
unpredictable and fragile.

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:27.240
I submit that he led his life
and he governed the nation

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:28.890
in what Henry Kissinger
once referred

00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:32.820
to as the most tumultuous
four year period since Truman.

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:36.260
With this tragic sensibility,
with this sense

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:40.660
that everything could end
tomorrow and that therefore you had

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:46.130
to do the best you could today,
you had to do everything you could

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:50.860
to make the world a little better
because one could never be sure

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:53.480 position:56%
when everything would be taken away.

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:58.650
I think these two experiences,
not particularly well known,

00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:03.920
it's not read my lips, it's
not Dana Carvey or the things

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:06.050
that really shaped the man

00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:10.210
who became the 41st President
of the United States.

00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:16.510
Couple of things on the other
side, my view of President Bush is

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:21.530
that he was a much more
affective politician

00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:23.190
than we give him credit for.

00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:26.960
Part of that is because his last
political act only netted 37%

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.540
of the reelection vote.

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:30.190
He was running against Bill Clinton

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:34.040
who as he once later said was
the Sam Walton of partisanship.

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:39.830
You know, Bush was-- by
1992, President Bush was not

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:43.430
in a political world he
understood in many ways.

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:45.520
There was the rise of
reflexive partisanship,

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:48.410
there was the rise
of alternative media.

00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:52.940
Remember before there was Twitter
and there was Trump, there was CNN

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:57.370
and Ross Perot and Cable
TV and Bill Clinton.

00:17:57.370 --> 00:18:01.880 position:56%
As Mark Twain once said, history may
not repeat itself but it does rhyme.

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:05.400
And 1992 rhymes with 2016.

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:09.080
Remember Bill Clinton
went on Arsenio Hall.

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:13.190
George H.W. Bush thought Arsenio
Hall was a building at Andover.

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:21.420
And he had-- as where we took
Spanish, you know, he had no idea.

00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:26.530
No idea. So, he was just
not-- it was not his time.

00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:30.800
It had been 12 years under
Reagan and Bush, we had not had--

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:34.200
we had not had more than eight
years of single party rule

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:38.390
since James Monroe, except for
the Roosevelt and Truman era.

00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:43.530 position:56%
So it was already historical anomaly
for him to-- for him to be in power.

00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:48.680
But there are three things that he
did along the way to a mass power,

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:53.280
that were not wildly admirable.

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:59.080
And my own, my biographical view
is that he always redeemed himself

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:02.520
and that's what makes this
tone, this level of conversation

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:04.830
for my purposes possible.

00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:07.770 position:56%
First, when he's running for the--
he's running for the Senate in Texas

00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:11.910
in 1964, running against Ralph
Yarborough, Ralph Yarborough

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:14.810
who was the great populous
senator there.

00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:18.730
George H.W. Bush opposed
the 1964 Civil Rights Act.

00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:20.240
It's not something we like to talk

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:24.110
about particularly not
today in Washington, right?

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:29.150
But in 1968 in the wake of
the assassination of Dr. King,

00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:32.030
George H.W. Bush who
had won the house seat

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:35.690
in 1966 representing the
7th district of Texas

00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:39.530
in Houston votes for open housing.

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:43.340
He goes down to Texas,
to Memorial High School

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:46.850
for a ferocious meeting
with his constituents.

00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:48.550
They were screaming things at him.

00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:51.940
They were using epitaphs that
you-- they shouldn't have used then

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:54.500
and you sure as hell can't use now.

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:57.930
Saying, "We didn't send you up
there to help these people."

00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:00.440
And Bush stood his ground.

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:01.750
He was 41 years old.

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:07.550
He stood his ground and he
said, "I cannot count in it,

00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:13.160
sending African-American soldiers
to Vietnam to fight for America

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:18.380
and then say, they can't buy a
house in a given neighborhood.

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:20.600
He quoted Edmund Burke who said

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:23.830
that your representative does
not simply offer you a mirror

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:26.920
of your will, but offers
you his best judgment.

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:32.310
And in that moment he showed
a measure of political courage

00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:35.610
that helped give him the
strength to keep pushing on.

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:38.980
He won the crowd over
and he move forward.

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:44.340
The second thing that was not
particularly admirable was the 1988

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:45.730
presidential campaign.

00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:47.570 position:56%
Many of you in the room remember it.

00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:49.350
It was not high-minded.

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:52.420 position:56%
We talk about the pledge of
allegiance, we talk about furloughs,

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:56.650
we talked about flag
factories and flag burning.

00:20:56.650 --> 00:21:00.620
It was a values campaign
in many ways.

00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:03.130
And then a lot of people
thought it was unfair

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:06.090
to the governor of Massachusetts.

00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:11.700
But what does Bush do after
he wins that campaign?

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:16.270
Immediately, the press
conference after the election

00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:19.570 position:56%
and the George Brown Convention
Center in Houston where he announces

00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:21.400
that Jim Bakker is going
to become secretary

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:23.760
of state, he's asked about this.

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:25.380
He's asked about the campaign.

00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:29.090
And Bush says, "That's
history, we are moving forward."

00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:34.440
He drew a direct line, somewhat
to his political detriment

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:38.250
between what you set on the
campaign trail and what you did

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:41.620
as a responsible officer
of government.

00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:44.390
He learned this I think in
china when he was there,

00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:48.390
remember this is a man who is a
member of Congress, the ambassador

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:51.830
of the united nations, Chairman of
the Republican National Committee,

00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:56.540 position:56%
envoy to China, Director of the
CIA, Vice President for eight years,

00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:58.920
he never hosted a reality show,

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:02.250
but besides that he had
every possible qualification

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:05.040
for President.

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:11.620
So he said that he--
that it was history.

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:17.030
What he learned in china was that
he picked up a phrase from Mao

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:22.300
that campaigns were about firing
the empty canons of rhetoric,

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:23.990
the empty canons of rhetoric.

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:26.770
Interestingly Ronald Reagan would
never have said that, right?

00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:28.630
Franklin Roosevelt would
never have said that.

00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:31.780
They saw a connection between
politics and government

00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:34.710
that if you did not run
for a particular mandate,

00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:36.560
you would have trouble governing.

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:38.530
And that happened in Bush's term.

00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:44.440 position:56%
He did not run for a particular
mandate, he ran as a particular man.

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:47.360
His argument was highly personal.

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:51.860
It was that he could be trusted
with the affairs of others.

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:56.960 position:56%
My own personal reaction to him, one
of the reasons I wrote this book is

00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:04.540
that I had a very caricature sense
of him when he was president.

00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:08.250
I was an undergraduate
through most of the presidency.

00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:10.590
I attended a small
college in the university--

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:15.010 position:56%
in Tennessee called the University
of the South, in Sewanee, Tennessee.

00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:17.760
There may be one or two of you
who are not be familiar with it.

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:21.350
It is best understood
as a combination

00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:23.570
of Downton Abbey and deliverance.

00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:32.160
And so my best friend in college
was man you all may have heard of,

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:35.160
he's from Lynchburg, Tennessee,
his name s Jack Daniels.

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:41.940
And so, I was a little fuzzy on
a couple of things that unfolded.

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:44.640
I felt the gulf war was
about Destin, Florida.

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:49.990
So when I met President
Bush I had this kind

00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:53.020
of Dana Carvey view of him.

00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:55.660
But almost instantly,
this is in the late '90s,

00:23:55.660 --> 00:24:00.150
I realized that he possessed
a quiet persistent charisma.

00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:03.480
How many here-- How many people
here have met George Bush?

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:04.780
Pretty good number.

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:08.870
How many here have had or
received a note from him?

00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:12.590
Probably a dozen people
in this room.

00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:17.590
He has this ineffable
sense of command.

00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:21.220
I had a teacher once who
defined charm as the capacity

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:26.000
to make others love you
without them quite knowing why.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.300
And that is true of George Bush.

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:31.850
There is something about
him, it's why if you met him,

00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:35.020
you were with him, if you only
knew him through television

00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:36.540
and the electronic media,

00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:40.230
you probably were not
going to be as impressed.

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:42.490
But as he once put it
when he ran for president

00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:46.440
in 1988, I have 30,000 friends.

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:47.740
And he did.

00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:50.670
Remember, George Bush saw life
as one long reunion mixer.

00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:55.160
He was never happier than
when he was, you know,

00:24:55.160 --> 00:25:00.610
had a vodka in his hand and was
playing horseshoes with somebody.

00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:04.530
Back to ''88 quickly, so
the campaign is a disaster.

00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:09.460 position:56%
He comes in and he tries to build a
culture of compromise and consensus.

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:13.480
He's the last president to pass
significant bipartisan legislation

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:18.460
with significant majorities from
pluralities from both caucuses.

00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:20.790
He passes the Americans
with Disabilities Act.

00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:24.370
I had a young man walk up
to me last night and say

00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:28.510
that he was a special
needs kid, a young man

00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:33.050
and that he thanked god
every day for President Bush.

00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:36.340
Because without President Bush
he could not have gone to college

00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:39.170
because the accommodations
for his test taking

00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:44.090
and making sure he got the help
he needed would not have existed

00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:46.830
without the Americans
with Disabilities Act,

00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:50.600
which is the single most
untraditional republican bill

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:52.290
that you can imagine.

00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:57.790
Bush signed it because he believed
it was in the spirit of fair play.

00:25:57.790 --> 00:26:01.100
George Bush is a man who when
he was a child in Greenwich,

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:06.620
his nickname was have-half because
if he had a treat or a dessert,

00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:10.800
he would cut it in half and give
the other half to the other kid.

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:15.890
His brother said that he was
born with an innate empathy

00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:20.760
and there is something about,
and as we head into next week

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:23.580
in the next 40 days,
which sounds biblical

00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:26.600
and we may be facing
a biblical thing,

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:30.730
and the moon shall turn to blood.

00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:35.750
I don't see the lions and the
lambs lying down together,

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:39.110
but maybe in a swing state or two.

00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:43.470
But character is destiny.

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:48.690
The Greeks were right, and policies
change, circumstances change,

00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:53.670
but character tends not to when
people reach the point of running

00:26:53.670 --> 00:26:55.450
at this level for president.

00:26:55.450 --> 00:27:00.690 position:56%
And George Bush's character was
always one while driven by ambition,

00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:05.000
driven by appetite, he
was delighted, you know,

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.290
if he wanted to win and
if he won the nature

00:27:08.290 --> 00:27:11.100 position:56%
of reality was somebody had to lose.

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:13.580
And that was just fine with him.

00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:18.280
But by God, he was always going
to reach out right afterward

00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:19.580
and bring people together.

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:21.110
A quick story on this.

00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:26.510
So in March of 1989,
John Tower fails

00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:29.450
to become the Secretary of Defense.

00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:33.400
Bush reaches out to Dick
Cheney who is then in the house

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:35.480
to become the Secretary of Defense.

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:37.600
That opens a place in
the house leadership.

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:41.440
It was like a wing of a butterfly
that produces a hurricane.

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:44.120
Gingrich, Newt Gingrich
runs for that job.

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:49.350
A Congressman from Minnesota named
Vin Weber runs Gingrich's campaign

00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:51.020
within the caucus.

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:52.920
The story, the papers
are full of stories

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:55.090
about how George Bush is compromise

00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:58.690
and conciliatory approach
is being directly attacked

00:27:58.690 --> 00:28:00.670
by Newt Gingrich's confrontation.

00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:02.620
This is a man who would
put out a memo

00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:06.140
to his republican colleagues
saying use the following words

00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:07.510
to describe democrats.

00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:11.240
Sick was one of them.

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:15.950
On American, outrageous, this
is the opposite of the world

00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:17.620
that George Bush had grown up in.

00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:20.650
Three of George Bush's best friends
in Washington were Democrats,

00:28:20.650 --> 00:28:24.290
Ashley of Ohio, Sonny
Montgomery of Mississippi,

00:28:24.290 --> 00:28:27.300
and Dan Rostenkowksi of Chicago.

00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:30.570
Bush kept his locker in the
house gym so that he could go up

00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:34.250
and play paddle ball and sit in
the sauna with the Democrats,

00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:36.060
that in very much thinking about,

00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:40.350
but he wanted to be part
of that conversation.

00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:44.580
He wanted to reach out because he
believed with Franklin Roosevelt

00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:48.700
that the science of human
relationships was absolutely

00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:51.740
essential to the art of politics.

00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:54.780
That was the air he breathed.

00:28:54.780 --> 00:29:03.030
So, when Gingrich wins, Bush calls
and asked Gingrich and Vin Weber,

00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:06.650
the guy who had ran the campaign
within the caucus to come

00:29:06.650 --> 00:29:08.280
to the White House for a beer.

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:12.620
They go up to the residence, they
have a beer, and as Weber put it,

00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:15.550
only George Bush would have
remembered to invite the guy

00:29:15.550 --> 00:29:17.430
who ran the campaign in the house.

00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:20.830
You know, he was the typical
thoughtful thing to do.

00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:25.320
They have the beer, and
Gingrich and Weber can tell

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:28.870
that there is something Bush
wants to say but isn't quite same.

00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:32.110
That's the definition
of being a wasp.

00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:38.910
And finally as they're standing
up Weber says, "Mr. President,

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:43.310
what is it that worries
you most about us?"

00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:46.150
And bush is relieved to have
an opportunity to say so.

00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:53.780
And he says, I worry that sometimes
your idealism may get in the way

00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:57.640
of what I think of
as sound governance.

00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:01.760
I want to repeat that at the risk
of pulling a rubio [phonetic].

00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:09.160
I worry that sometimes your
idealism may get in the way

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:13.320
of what I think of
as sound governance.

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:15.440
And Weber said, he
always appreciated,

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:19.500
Bush didn't say your ideology,
your ideology, your nuttiness,

00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:24.110
your purity, your inflexibility,
he said idealism.

00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:28.400
He was giving them credit
that they genuinely believed

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:31.010
in philosophical agenda
in which they were trying

00:30:31.010 --> 00:30:33.400
to build a Republican
house majority,

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:36.750
which would in fact
happen five years later.

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:42.840
But what he wanted and what he
didn't get was reciprocal credit

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:45.990
that he was now the senior
constitutional officer

00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:47.820
in the United States of America.

00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:51.140
He is the one public official
as Andrew Jackson pointed out,

00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:56.910
elected by all the people and
that he had a constitutional duty,

00:30:56.910 --> 00:31:05.470
a cultural duty to try to govern
soundly, not simply score points

00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:10.250
to get to the next midterm
to help a given movement,

00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:13.110
to win partisan points.

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:17.650
I know this sound as though
I am discussing Thermopylae,

00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:22.180
but this was just 25 years
ago, a quarter century ago

00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:24.770
and this was his ambient reality.

00:31:24.770 --> 00:31:26.910
And he paid for it, right?

00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:31.610
He said, read my lips in an
uneasy marriage to supply-siders.

00:31:31.610 --> 00:31:34.200
He worried all the time that he
was going to have to break it.

00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:36.320
He had to break it in 1990.

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:39.420
As he put it he knew he
was going to be dead meat

00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:42.030
as only George Bush could say.

00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:44.890
Dead meat, you know.

00:31:44.890 --> 00:31:46.920 position:56%
Dana Carvey, I told you I asked him,

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:50.910
how did he build his
impression of George Bush?

00:31:50.910 --> 00:31:55.450
He said, the key to doing George
H.W. Bush was Mr. Rogers trying

00:31:55.450 --> 00:31:56.750
to be John Wayne.

00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:58.050
Yeah.

00:31:58.050 --> 00:31:59.350
[ Laughter ]

00:31:59.350 --> 00:32:02.190
Yeah. With six shooters,
not going to do it.

00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:07.210
So, I spent a lot of
time with these people.

00:32:07.210 --> 00:32:14.380 position:56%
So, that's-- to me that's the key,
the key legacy is that this is a man

00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:19.010
who did put the country first,
it's President Obama's view,

00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:21.230
I interviewed him for this.

00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:26.150
He wasn't perfect by any means, it
is arguable that there wasn't much

00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:30.460
to do in the second term,
but I would suggest,

00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:36.510
given where we've come
in the last 16 years now,

00:32:36.510 --> 00:32:40.170
20 years since he left office.

00:32:40.170 --> 00:32:47.610
Then we really need to consider
recovering as best we can,

00:32:47.610 --> 00:32:53.850
the virtues that were embodied
in this particular man.

00:32:53.850 --> 00:32:57.400
The partisanship changed,
the media landscape changed,

00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:01.550
it is not the world in
which he in any way grew up

00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:06.990
or would have understood, but there
are certain values that can be,

00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:09.240
I think ultimately recovered.

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:13.640
I did this book partly
because President Bush

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:17.400
and Mrs. Bush both shared
their diaries with me.

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:22.350
The president kept a diary through
the presidency he dictated, once,

00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:24.180
twice, three times a week.

00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:25.750
It's a remarkable document.

00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:27.960
He talks into the recorder.

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:30.410
You can hear the blade,
submarine one.

00:33:30.410 --> 00:33:33.220
You can hear the engines
of Air Force One.

00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:37.560
You can hear the coffee slurping,
sometimes a martini or two.

00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:40.040
Sometimes he is just beaten down.

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:42.450
A fascinating document.

00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:45.800
And to make sure I got the
whole story, I asked Mrs. Bush

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:47.770
if she would share her diary.

00:33:47.770 --> 00:33:51.080
And I will say that
when President Bush, 43,

00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:56.950
learned that his mother had decided
to let me read his mother's diary,

00:33:56.950 --> 00:34:00.360 position:56%
the reaction in Dallas was not warm.

00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:05.510
As he put it, that's
not good for me.

00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:09.080
[ Laughter and Applause ]

00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:13.460
OK. God knows what mom wrote.

00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:24.200
But what-- what I found was
incredibly decent people, again,

00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:27.950
not perfect but these
are the kinds of people

00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:32.520
that you hope ultimately
end up leading the country.

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:38.660
I want to close with this, I
mentioned the death of Robin Bush,

00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:44.390
the George Bush I got to know is
the one who I think is still not

00:34:44.390 --> 00:34:47.440
as well-known as he should be,
though I'm doing all I can.

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:52.180
You know, he is leading this
wonderful retirement life.

00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:55.910
He's been in a wheelchair
now for four years.

00:34:55.910 --> 00:34:58.280
He is suffering from
a former Parkinson's.

00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:01.460
I saw him three weeks ago.

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:06.100
He still follows everything
and is devastating.

00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:09.980
When he does speak
he is right on point.

00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:13.680
We were at lunch this summer and
Mrs. Bush was showing a bracelet

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:17.220
that he had given her and
he looked at it and said,

00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:19.470
"I was a romantic devil."

00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:21.930
[ Laughter ]

00:35:21.930 --> 00:35:23.790
This was also shortly
after the moment

00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:26.980
where when he was jumping
out of a plane at '90.

00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:32.230
he was going to land at St.
Anne's, the parish near the house.

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:35.350
And Mrs. Bush said it is a good
thing we're doing it at the church

00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:37.510
because then we can just
bury him right there.

00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:40.300
[ Laughter ]

00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:46.480
So, they have been
married for 72 years.

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:48.000
Seventy-two years.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.220
When I was out talking
about the book last fall,

00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:55.370 position:56%
I was with an audience and down
front there was a slightly older man

00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:59.660
with his wife and I made
that point, I said 72 years.

00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:03.030
And the guy out front
said, "Jesus Christ."

00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:05.040
[ Laughter ]

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:09.360
I think he had a long ride home.

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:11.710
[ Laughter ]

00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:13.680
That's a true story.

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:17.650
He just couldn't get there.

00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:20.800
But this is the real George Bush.

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:24.120
This is the letter he wrote to
his mother in the late 1950s.

00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:26.800
It is about Robin's
death, it is about Robin,

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:29.590
at this point George W., Jeb,

00:36:29.590 --> 00:36:33.360
Marvin and Neil have both been
born, Doro has not been born.

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:34.920
So that was 1959.

00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:37.710
So we think this letter
was written in '57 or '58.

00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:40.440 position:56%
It was found in his mother's papers.

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:44.000
She died two weeks after he lost
the election to Bill Clinton.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:50.150
And this is the George Bush that I
got to know and I hope you do too.

00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:56.130
He wrote, "There is about our house
a need, the running, pulsating,

00:36:56.130 --> 00:36:59.710
restlessness of the four boys
as they struggle to learn

00:36:59.710 --> 00:37:03.390
and grow needs a counterpart.

00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:06.680
We need some starched
crisp frocks to go with all

00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:09.990
of our torn-kneed blue
jeans and helmets.

00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:15.220
We need some soft blonde hair
to offset those crew cuts.

00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:19.570
We need a doll house to stand
firm against our forts and rackets

00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:22.590
and thousand baseball cards.

00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:25.910
We need a legitimate
Christmas angel,

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:30.050
one who doesn't have
cuffs beneath the dress.

00:37:30.050 --> 00:37:33.940
We need someone who
is afraid of frogs.

00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:38.850
We need someone to cry
when I get mad, not argue.

00:37:38.850 --> 00:37:45.110
We need a little one who can kiss
without leaving egg or jam or gum.

00:37:45.110 --> 00:37:47.770
We need a girl.

00:37:47.770 --> 00:37:54.210
We had one once, she'd fight and
cry and play like all the rest.

00:37:54.210 --> 00:37:57.880
But there was about
her certain softness.

00:37:57.880 --> 00:37:59.690
She was patient.

00:37:59.690 --> 00:38:03.230
Her hugs were just a
little less wiggly.

00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:07.880
She'd stand beside our bed
until I felt her there.

00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:12.410
Silently and comfortable, she'd
put those precious fragrant locks

00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:16.010
against my chest and fall asleep.

00:38:16.010 --> 00:38:20.670
Her piece made me feel
strong and so very important.

00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:25.460
My daddy had a caress,
search and ownership

00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:28.690
which touched a slightly
different spot than the

00:38:28.690 --> 00:38:32.450
"Hi Dad," I love so much.

00:38:32.450 --> 00:38:34.360
But she is still with us.

00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:37.190
We need her and yet we have her.

00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:41.230
We can't touch her and
yet we can feel her.

00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:45.990
We hope she'll stay in our
house for a long, long time."

00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:49.980
In the course of interviewing the
president, I asked him to read

00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:54.300
that letter allowed
to me in Houston.

00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:55.800
And long before he finished,

00:38:55.800 --> 00:39:00.860
he broke down with an extraordinary
level of physical sobbing.

00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:05.710 position:56%
So, much so that his chief of staff,
whose office was next door came in

00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:10.970
and she said, "Why did you want
president bush to do that?"

00:39:10.970 --> 00:39:16.230
And I said, "If you want
to know someone's heart,"

00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:20.090
and before I could finish my
sentence the president said,

00:39:20.090 --> 00:39:23.910
"You have to know what breaks it."

00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:25.710
Thank you very much.

00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:37.800
[ Applause ]

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:39.600
Thank you.

00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:48.790
[ Applause ]

00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:50.240
We have some time for
some questions here.

00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:51.540
How much time we got?

00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:52.850
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yeah.

00:39:52.850 --> 00:39:56.800
Jon. I just finished your
book, this book, fantastic,

00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:59.460
I read a lot of history
of presidents.

00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:00.760
&gt;&gt; Jon Meacham: Thank you.

00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:02.070
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: And it
was one question--

00:40:02.070 --> 00:40:04.730
I have two little questions,
one you answered.

00:40:04.730 --> 00:40:06.320
You said every other page

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:10.030
when George Bush was home,
he wrote in his diary.

00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:12.270
And I was going to
asked, did he typed it?

00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:14.900
But you mentioned he
used the microphone.

00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:17.650
&gt;&gt; Jon Meacham: He had a tape
recorded that he'd bought at--

00:40:17.650 --> 00:40:19.780
sort of the staples of the era.

00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:21.080
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Right.

00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:23.630
&gt;&gt; Jon Meacham: He didn't want it
to be a government tape recorder.

00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:27.200
He carried it in his
briefcase, carried it everywhere.

00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:31.740
He often did it late at
night, early in the morning.

00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:38.880
He used the office on the-- in
the residence and loved that study

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:40.850
of the Oval Office
and would often do it.

00:40:40.850 --> 00:40:43.470
He got up at about 5 every morning.

00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:45.510
They would take the dogs
out and then come in.

00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:47.610
They'd read about five papers.

00:40:47.610 --> 00:40:52.170
And then he would go down
and do some dictation.

00:40:52.170 --> 00:40:58.550
Fortunately, he tended to do
more in times of crisis than not,

00:40:58.550 --> 00:41:01.590
which for most diary
keepers is the opposite.

00:41:01.590 --> 00:41:05.620
Part of the power of
the diary I think is

00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:10.750
that he didn't really believe,
it was part of his code

00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:13.310
that presidents don't complain.

00:41:13.310 --> 00:41:16.700
They don't-- as he put it, they
don't wine about oh-oh it's me,

00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:18.840
you're just damn lucky to be there.

00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:24.700
And I think he said things to
himself that he could not say

00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:30.870
to Mrs. Bush, to Governor Sununu,
to Dan Quayle, to Boyd and Gray,

00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:34.260
you know, the people of Brent
Scowcroft, the people around him.

00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:38.140
And so, I actually believed
it's a therapeutic document.

00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:42.900
I'm going to publish a volume of
the diary, but he has to be gone.

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:45.530
The way he's going,
I'll be gone first.

00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:47.620
So, don't wait up.

00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:48.920
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yeah.

00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:52.300
Related to my second part was
you sort of alluded to that,

00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:59.460 position:56%
throughout the book you site this
and it's his quotation to some diary

00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:03.780 position:56%
and I'm wanting as a historian, do
you ever have the opportunity to get

00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:07.000
into a deep person's
mindset like that.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:11.040
How many-- Andrew Jackson certainly
didn't have a diary or whatever.

00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:13.210
&gt;&gt; Jon Meacham: You know, that
would require self reflection.

00:42:13.210 --> 00:42:14.510
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yeah.

00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:17.290
But I mean it must have
hit a lot of impact

00:42:17.290 --> 00:42:19.480 position:56%
on your personal feelings toward him

00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:22.000
and writing the way
you wrote the book.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.300
&gt;&gt; Jon Meacham: Thank
you for saying that.

00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:26.560
Yes. I'm the reason I did the book
because he offered me the diary

00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:29.950
and he offered to talk to
me as much as I wanted.

00:42:29.950 --> 00:42:32.660
And if you what I do,
that doesn't happen much.

00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:33.960
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yeah.

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:36.580
&gt;&gt; Jon Meacham: You know,
there are only 44 of these guys

00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:39.460
and there aren't that
many still kicking.

00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:42.950
So, it was a remarkable
historical opportunity.

00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:46.780
I feel very privileged to
have had the chance to do it.

00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:50.680
I should say there were no
conditions on the project.

00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:52.530
No one read it, no one reviewed it.

00:42:52.530 --> 00:42:56.770
The one exception was Mrs.
Bush's diary because it had

00:42:56.770 --> 00:42:59.200
so much personal stuff,
she kept that diary

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:02.240
from 1948 until this morning.

00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:06.460
She gets up at 5 o'clock every
morning and writes in her diary.

00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:08.890
And several of her children said,

00:43:08.890 --> 00:43:13.710
"Please don't tell me
what she said about me."

00:43:13.710 --> 00:43:19.180
But she was going to seal that
for 50 years after she died.

00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:21.540
And people say, "Well, how did
you get her to give it to you?"

00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:25.120
And my technical historical answer,
I don't want to overwhelm you

00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:29.440
with a high brow answers, I begged.

00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:34.850
But I accepted the one condition on
the project, which was she wanted

00:43:34.850 --> 00:43:39.920
to see any direct quotations from
herself, which given a document

00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:42.880
that span 70 years I thought
was totally reasonable.

00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:46.370
So I took her 90 pages of excerpts

00:43:46.370 --> 00:43:48.780
with her fascinating
afternoon in Houston one day.

00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:50.300
She was reading along.

00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:52.590
And every once in a
while, she'd say, "My,

00:43:52.590 --> 00:43:56.620
I was an opinionated 37-year old."

00:43:56.620 --> 00:43:58.820
You know, ma'am, the
apple didn't fall far

00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:00.920
from the chronological
tree, you know.

00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:03.770
At 91, you're not pulling
a lot of punches.

00:44:03.770 --> 00:44:05.320
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Thank you.

00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:06.620
&gt;&gt; Jon Meacham: Thank you.

00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:07.920
Yes, ma'am?

00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:09.220
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Hi.

00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:10.520
Thank you.

00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:12.750
I just was interested in how you
were kind of drawing comparisons

00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:17.610
between what's going on in the
campaigns now and President Bush

00:44:17.610 --> 00:44:19.810
and how he conducted himself.

00:44:19.810 --> 00:44:24.210
And it's interesting on NPR, and
I can't remember the analyst name,

00:44:24.210 --> 00:44:28.800
unfortunately, but just on
Friday they were talking about--

00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:34.140
there's some people believe
that direct line from the Bushes

00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:41.030
and Lee Atwater and Karl Rove to
what is now going on with Trump.

00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:42.330
&gt;&gt; Jon Meacham: Yeah.

00:44:42.330 --> 00:44:46.100
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Only that during the
Bush's era and perhaps relevant

00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:50.690
to their personalities,
their status, et cetera,

00:44:50.690 --> 00:44:55.120
that they did not do these--
say these things themselves.

00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:59.350
And now, the difference is
they use other people to kind

00:44:59.350 --> 00:45:02.120 position:56%
of put these negative thoughts out--

00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:03.420
&gt;&gt; Jon Meacham: Yeah.

00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:05.040
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: -- and that would be
politically advantageous to them.

00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:09.900
But, they did use that as a tactic
to when there are elections,

00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:12.820
whereas now, you know, Trump
has taken it to another level.

00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:15.220
And he actually is the
messenger himself as opposed to--

00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:16.520
&gt;&gt; Jon Meacham: Yeah.

00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:17.820
Trump needs no subcontractors.

00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:19.120
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Right.

00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:23.450
But I think that, you know, the
connection is very unfortunate.

00:45:23.450 --> 00:45:26.030
And I'm just wondering
whether, you know,

00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:29.540
you've painted a very positive
picture of President Bush.

00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:33.110
I was very disappointed
about the Lee Atwater

00:45:33.110 --> 00:45:35.740
and Willie Horton situation.

00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:37.690
So that comes to my memory.

00:45:37.690 --> 00:45:44.410
And I'm just wondering if in your
view, him as a decent participating

00:45:44.410 --> 00:45:47.430
in that says something about
the nature of our politics

00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:50.050
within the context of
the American democracy

00:45:50.050 --> 00:45:54.240
that it encourages decent people
to do the wrong thing in order

00:45:54.240 --> 00:46:00.170
to achieve their objectives
or is this just, you know,

00:46:00.170 --> 00:46:02.790
maybe you don't see
it as that important,

00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:05.980
but just I didn't get the
sense from your comments today.

00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:07.280
&gt;&gt; Jon Meacham: Yeah.

00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:08.580
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: I haven't read
your book unfortunately,

00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:11.470
so I don't want to, you know,
say that you don't cover it.

00:46:11.470 --> 00:46:14.130
But I didn't get your sense-- the
sense from your comments today--

00:46:14.130 --> 00:46:15.430
&gt;&gt; Jon Meacham: Right.

00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:16.730
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: -- that you've
felt that that was important.

00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:18.030
Thank you.

00:46:18.030 --> 00:46:19.330
&gt;&gt; Jon Meacham: Right.

00:46:19.330 --> 00:46:20.630
Right. What I tried
to say is that now,

00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:22.790
when I talk about the '88
campaign, obviously we're talking

00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:28.000
about the furlough ads, the Horton
ads although the Horton ads were an

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.390
independent expenditure group

00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:33.300
and we can spend the
next three hours on that.

00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:35.780
But you said something
quite brilliant there,

00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:42.070
which is politics is
not a pure undertaking.

00:46:42.070 --> 00:46:49.160 position:56%
And if you want to amass power, to
try to be in a position of influence

00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:54.290
when the crises of the age come,
you're going to cut some corners.

00:46:54.290 --> 00:46:59.740
You are going to have some moments
where you say and you do things

00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:03.500
or you countenance
things that are said

00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:06.670
or done, which you are not proud.

00:47:06.670 --> 00:47:10.980
And I don't think there's any
doubt that the 1988 campaign is--

00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:19.930
as examples of George Bush in his
apparatus pushing certain troops

00:47:19.930 --> 00:47:26.720
that on reflection and even in
real time are very uncomfortable

00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:31.570
and risk falling into
fear base politics.

00:47:31.570 --> 00:47:33.650
There's no question about that.

00:47:33.650 --> 00:47:40.700
To my mind what redeems George H.W.
Bush, is that once he got power,

00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:44.520
he did everything he
could to do good with it.

00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:51.000
So you didn't see that
on-- in the term.

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:55.670
Without that redemption, it
would be a very different story.

00:47:55.670 --> 00:48:00.030
Now, is there a direct
line between--

00:48:00.030 --> 00:48:02.100
in fact, I would go
back even further.

00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:08.360 position:56%
I mean, from 1968 in where we are,
because some of the same people were

00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:14.120
in the campaign in 1968 is
the popular understanding

00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:16.560 position:56%
of the southern strategy come along.

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:19.460
People have argued, is the
republican party now dealing

00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:22.420
with a Frankenstein
monster that has gotten

00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:25.260
out of control and
now has iron chair.

00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:29.110
You know, that's one of the--
that's one of the questions.

00:48:29.110 --> 00:48:36.140
I'm a little skeptical of that
argument in terms of a direct line.

00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:40.630
I think that we have to judge
political figures on a totally

00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:43.740
of their lives and the
totally of their records.

00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:47.430
And I believe that the
country is better off

00:48:47.430 --> 00:48:50.360
because George Bush was
President for 40 years.

00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:52.340
I don't think he was perfect.

00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:56.160 position:56%
I unquestionably the attack politics

00:48:56.160 --> 00:49:01.330
of the southern strategy
were used in his campaign.

00:49:01.330 --> 00:49:04.260
But, you know, even I remember
in interviewing Bill Clinton

00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:05.900
about this, and he said, you know,

00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:08.640
the thing about the Bushes
is there's not a racist bone

00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:10.290
in their body.

00:49:10.290 --> 00:49:12.500
Michael Dukakis still made

00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:16.490
that he had totally understood
why Willie Horton would be used

00:49:16.490 --> 00:49:18.630
in the campaign.

00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:21.820
All of this is in the book.

00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:27.530
So, I understand the argument
about the direct line.

00:49:27.530 --> 00:49:32.360
My sense is there is-- if
you're looking for philosophical

00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:37.600
or moral consistency looking at
the American presidency or those

00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:41.260
who seek it is probably not
the first place to look.

00:49:41.260 --> 00:49:45.580
So, you need to look at moments
on the totally of the lives

00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:51.010
where they manage to transcend
those shortcomings as my view.

00:49:51.010 --> 00:49:52.310
Yes sir.

00:49:52.310 --> 00:49:53.980
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: You have
probably answered this question

00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:59.130
at least indirectly, I recently
saw the play in Stanton, bloody,

00:49:59.130 --> 00:50:00.710
bloody Andrew Jackson, which was--

00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:02.010
&gt;&gt; Jon Meacham: Yes.

00:50:02.010 --> 00:50:03.310
&gt;&gt; -- a parody of Jackson.

00:50:03.310 --> 00:50:07.380
And I think of our current
campaign about unbridled populism

00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:09.370
and the manipulation
of that populism.

00:50:09.370 --> 00:50:11.530
Do you see any parallels today?

00:50:11.530 --> 00:50:12.830
&gt;&gt; Jon Meacham: Yeah.

00:50:12.830 --> 00:50:14.130
With Jackson and Trump, you know,

00:50:14.130 --> 00:50:17.910
I've resisted this for
a couple of reasons.

00:50:17.910 --> 00:50:21.770
One is that Jackson brought an
enormous amount of experience.

00:50:21.770 --> 00:50:23.380
You can argue whether
it was good experience

00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:25.550
or not, but to the presidency.

00:50:25.550 --> 00:50:29.690
He'd been a judge, he'd been a
senator, he'd been a general.

00:50:29.690 --> 00:50:34.080
And so, the idea that--
I mean, fundamentally,

00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:38.410
the choice is being presented to
us in the next 45 days or so is one

00:50:38.410 --> 00:50:41.290
between one of the most
conventionally prepared candidates

00:50:41.290 --> 00:50:46.280
in American history and the
least conventionally prepared.

00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:48.210
And interviewed Mr.
Trump about this.

00:50:48.210 --> 00:50:49.840
He makes no bones about this.

00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:51.350
This is not a partisan point.

00:50:51.350 --> 00:50:52.740
I should say by the way as well,

00:50:52.740 --> 00:50:55.130
I voted for presidents
of both parties.

00:50:55.130 --> 00:50:58.780
I expect to again.

00:50:58.780 --> 00:51:06.350
And so, what I hope to see in
terms of Trump and populism

00:51:06.350 --> 00:51:13.060
and that argument going forward
is that we can take the energy,

00:51:13.060 --> 00:51:18.600
the anger at the globalization--
the forces of globalization

00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:24.660 position:56%
and find some way to channel those
into constructive reforms as opposed

00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:30.180
to finger pointing and
blame casting on the other.

00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:34.660
And it is an inarguable
point that the United States

00:51:34.660 --> 00:51:38.460
of America has become
in direct proportion

00:51:38.460 --> 00:51:43.610
to how widely we have opened our
arms from the very beginning.

00:51:43.610 --> 00:51:45.410
And--

00:51:45.410 --> 00:51:49.300
[ Applause ]

00:51:49.300 --> 00:51:53.000
-- we are dynamic in proportion
to people who come here.

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:54.780
We are the only nation on Earth

00:51:54.780 --> 00:51:57.220
where you can become
an American simply

00:51:57.220 --> 00:52:00.030
by saying you want
to be an American.

00:52:00.030 --> 00:52:04.030
We are not based on ethnicity,
we are not based on religion,

00:52:04.030 --> 00:52:08.970
we don't have to be born
into a certain tribe or clan,

00:52:08.970 --> 00:52:11.650
we are devoted to an idea.

00:52:11.650 --> 00:52:16.880
And I worry that the current
populous trend unlike the Jackson

00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:21.440
era, the current populous trend
is trying to limit the definition

00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:23.640
of what it means to be in America.

00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:27.510
Yet, that is a historical
and dangerous.

00:52:27.510 --> 00:52:35.500
[ Applause ]

00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:38.030
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: Let me
profess my question by saying

00:52:38.030 --> 00:52:39.710 position:56%
that I have finished your book, sir.

00:52:39.710 --> 00:52:41.710
And it's a superb piece of work.

00:52:41.710 --> 00:52:43.010
&gt;&gt; Jon Meacham: Thank you.

00:52:43.010 --> 00:52:44.310
That's enough.

00:52:44.310 --> 00:52:45.610
You can sit down.

00:52:45.610 --> 00:52:46.910
[ Laughter ]

00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:48.210
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: One more thing.

00:52:48.210 --> 00:52:49.510
There is--

00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:50.810
&gt;&gt; Jon Meacham: Downhill from here.

00:52:50.810 --> 00:52:52.110
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: OK.

00:52:52.110 --> 00:52:53.410
There's an aggregate ranking
of the presidents by historian.

00:52:53.410 --> 00:52:55.130
&gt;&gt; Jon Meacham: And thanks
dad, I appreciate it.

00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:57.430
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: And by historians
and presidential scholars

00:52:57.430 --> 00:53:02.870
that places George H.W. Bush
as 22nd among the president.

00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:05.100
How would you respond
to their answer?

00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:06.820
&gt;&gt; Jon Meacham: It takes-- sorry.

00:53:06.820 --> 00:53:09.680
That was Lee Atwater goes.

00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:11.670
It takes time.

00:53:11.670 --> 00:53:16.820
This was the earliest
possible point to do this book.

00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:21.260
My friend, Michael Beschloss has
a good rule that it takes 25 years

00:53:21.260 --> 00:53:25.550
to really get a sense and
let the passions cool.

00:53:25.550 --> 00:53:26.850
I think you'll rise up.

00:53:26.850 --> 00:53:29.070
I mean, one term presidents
have a hard time,

00:53:29.070 --> 00:53:32.720
although my fellow Tennessean James
K. Polk had a pretty good first

00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:38.760
term, although depending on how you
think about California, maybe not.

00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:43.620
So, it's a tumultuous term,
but I think when we look back

00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:49.970
on existential nuclear struggle
that ends peacably, it took Reagan

00:53:49.970 --> 00:53:54.590
and Bush-- I mean to be honest,
it took Democrats and Republicans

00:53:54.590 --> 00:53:59.540
and the people themselves from
Truman forward to end the Cold War.

00:53:59.540 --> 00:54:02.500
But I think we were fairly
lucky because I think

00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:08.180 position:56%
that Ronald Reagan did things in the
'80s that Bush could not in terms

00:54:08.180 --> 00:54:09.930
of setting a rhetorical example.

00:54:09.930 --> 00:54:12.400
And also Reagan has
a great negotiator.

00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:15.770
Remember he was-- head of
the Screen Actors Guild.

00:54:15.770 --> 00:54:19.710 position:56%
He used to say, people think
negotiating with Gorbachev is tough,

00:54:19.710 --> 00:54:22.660
they should have met Jack Warner.

00:54:22.660 --> 00:54:27.000
So I think that-- And then Bush
was able to come in and do things

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:29.240
that I don't think Reagan
would have been very good at.

00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:33.440
And so, I think that number
will go up, I really do.

00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:39.270
One irony parenthetically is it's
going to be fascinating to watch

00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:47.710 position:56%
over the next 20 to 30 years to what
extent Bush 41 historical stack is

00:54:47.710 --> 00:54:55.470
on a see-saw or on a proportional
lift with his sons, right?

00:54:55.470 --> 00:54:59.920
I think Bush 41, I know this,
Bush 41 for a long time believe

00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:05.250 position:56%
that his historical stack would
always be on a see-saw with Reagan's

00:55:05.250 --> 00:55:07.670
that he was this--
he was an asterisks

00:55:07.670 --> 00:55:11.120
as he put it himself after Reagan.

00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:15.850
Because of the dynastic drama,
it's going to be interesting to see

00:55:15.850 --> 00:55:21.560 position:56%
as people reevaluate George W. Bush,
what that does to George H.W. Bush

00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:25.030
because they did confront
two similar problems

00:55:25.030 --> 00:55:27.000
in very different ways.

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.340
I know they're-- getting
factor there is going to be

00:55:29.340 --> 00:55:34.680
if we have Clinton dynasty stories,
it's going to be like, you know,

00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:36.920
C-SPAN meets Lancaster in New York.

00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:40.680
I mean it's just going
to go on forever, so.

00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:43.100
Is that it?
