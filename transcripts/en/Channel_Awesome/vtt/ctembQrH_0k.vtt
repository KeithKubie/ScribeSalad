["The Review Must Go On"]

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:09.320
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it so you don't have to.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.520
(sigh) I'm in a little bit of a dilemma.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.140
You see, one of the first videos I ever did,

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.900
arguably THE first video I ever did,

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.020
was a review of Michael Bay's "Transformers" movie.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.860
It was...similar to another character's style.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.280
(a la Chester A. Bum) So it starts off like, "That copter was taken down years ago!"

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.540
[Descending helicopter noises]

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.440
And then they're like, "Get out of the copter or we'll shoot!"

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.660
So Wiki Wiki is going out with his British girlfriend,

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.260
who may or may not be dating the schmuck from Enchanted.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.820
But as you can tell, I liked it.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.780
It was stupid, but it's a guilty pleasure.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.580
I can't help what I like.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.100
But, (sigh) over the years,

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.420
this tradition kind of started where I would always review

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.600
a "Transformers" movie whenever it came out,

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.220
usually resulting in a crossover with said character.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.660
But here's the thing:

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.240
As they kept going, the review style mattered less

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.540
because I was running out of things to say.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.380
Mostly because the MOVIES were running out of things to say.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.000
Every single time one of these damn films came out, they just did the same thing

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.820
over and over and over!

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.500
And - and what am I supposed to say?!

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.580
"Oh, that happened again. That happened again."

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.180
There's no variety.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.340
As the reviews on the movies continued, I got more and more angry,

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.520
because I just didn't have much left.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.240
What was I supposed to say to this lazily written,

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.480
creatively empty franchise?

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.660
Michael Bay himself came out saying, "You can complain about it all you want,

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.320
"but you'll still go see it."

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.220
I don't wanna give money to that idea.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.440
The idea that someone can just keep putting out the exact same crap,

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.420
but we're too conditioned to break away.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.900
Look, I have the great luxury,

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.140
and it is a luxury,

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.840
of being one of the few critics who doesn't have to see

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.260
movies every weekend.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.600
I only see movies I feel are worth talking about,

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.260
whether good or bad, they actually have some relevance,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.920
they can have some meaning, they can...

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.800
something we can learn from.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.780
But honestly I feel like I've talked about

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.520
all I can with this series.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.940
It's just constant repeat with little to nothing added.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.300
I want to push for more original and challenging material.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.320
I don't want to support this shit like he predicted I will.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.700
Hollywood's going on and on how their shitty reboots aren't making that much money.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.780
Not because, they're shitty reboots, but because there's something wrong with us!

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.740
No, there's something wrong with you!

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.340
You keep doing the same thing over and over and we need new stuff!

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.200
But this series, for whatever reason, is never affected.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.680
They always make tons and tons of money.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.260
I don't want to review these movies anymore, because I don't think there's anything new left to review.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.120
But, (sigh), I also have a tradition.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.000
I always review this shit,

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.400
even though, in my opinion, there's nothing new to review.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.400
It's just the first film minus any surprises,

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.400
like all the other sequels were!

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.400
So, (sigh) what to do?

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:54.140
I am so convinced that this movie is going to be the exact same goddamn formula that all the other movies have been...

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.360
that I am actually going to review it... without seeing it.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:05.660
It is so tired and repetitive, that I'm pretty sure I can predict the piece of crap movie I would have suffered through.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.340
That's how bad things have gotten.

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.000
It might be off by a detail or two,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.780
but I'm sure I can still tell you what's going to happen.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.500
Now, you might be saying to yourself, and rightfully so, "that doesn't seem very fair!''

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.500
"You can't judge a movie without even seeing it."

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:26.360
So, I guess, look at this less as a review and more as a... artistic experiment.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.260
An experiment to see if Hollywood can really be so unimaginative and lazy,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.400
and yet we keep somehow still falling for it.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.000
Seeing if the rats will ever stop running through the maze with no reward.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And if you don't believe me, you think I'm lying, that I actually did see this movie and I'm just telling you what I saw,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.480
go ahead, it wouldn't be the first time somebody didn't believe somebody on the internet.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.280
But I get a feeling, if we measure both our brain cells, mine are going to be the exact same amount,

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.000
and yours are going to be less after SEEING THIS DAMN MOVIE!

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.820
And the funny thing is, I actually hope I'm wrong.

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.840
I hope I am wrong about everything I'm about to say.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:08.700
I hope somebody who worked on this film finally said, "Let's give some variety.  Something new. Something they haven't seen before.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.840
"Let's finally treat our audience like intelligent human beings."

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.440
But my guess is, THIS is what we're going to get.

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:21.240
It's going to start off years and years ago in the past.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:27.700
You think, "Oh, this is what the movie is going to be about: Transformers with knights and Nazis and catapults and flames."

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.400
But it's not. It's more of the same; just Transformers fighting in modern day in the city and/or desert.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.440
All this stuff with knights and Nazis that they're showing all over the trailers, that's only going to be in the first few minutes,

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.660
with probably a little flashback to it in the middle.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:45.000
But, pfft, you don't want to see Transformers fighting with knights, even though it's called "The Last Knight"!

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.580
Oh wait, yes you do, but you're not going to get it.

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.780
Because you need American McAmerican, played by Mark Wahlberg from the last movie.

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:57.800
Because he's the new main character, we'll have some sort of introduction with him getting used to Transformers in his everyday life,

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:03.700
leading to comedy that's not funny, but it's BIG, so your testicles will be like "YEAH, THAT'S FUNNY 'CAUSE IT'S BIG!"

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.000
But don't worry, we'll also get small, annoying comedic moments with obnoxious comedy relief.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.140
You pray to Christ they're not going to be in a lot of the film, but they probably are,

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:19.000
making dumb sex jokes to the first graders that shouldn't be watching this movie, but clearly this is the exact audience the film is made for.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.580
Speaking of which, we've got to set up our supporting cast, which is usually kids.

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:29.500
Whether high school, college, or even younger, we need a good looking kid who for some reason is an outcast, even though they could probably get by on looks alone.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.460
If it's a boy, he'll be awkward and funny; if it's a girl, she'll be a badass tech.

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:39.760
We need the geek, or geeks. One of them will probably die, because we only need one saying unfunny awkward dialogue.

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.620
And of course, we also need the hot chick who's also a brain, and they'll demonstrate this by giving her glasses.

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:50.500
She's supposed to be smarter than everyone else, but clearly she spent more time trying to get her makeup right than her computer-savvy dialogue.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:55.840
We need, of course, returning supporting cast: either Josh Duhamel, John Turturro, Stanley Tucci,

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.660
or if they're really desperate, all of them.

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.220
Maybe even a Shia cameo, if they're beyond desperate.

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:09.140
You need the celebrity suit: This is a person who looks really important to the story, but they're not, they're just there to read exposition.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.740
They get a big, dignified star to make you think there's a lot of weight to this role,

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:19.500
but usually they do something really stupid that you're supposed to think is funny, because it's that dignified star looking like a two year old,

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:23.000
but it's not funny; it's just that dignified star looking like a two year old.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.500
And that dignified star does it without question because "Eah, my dumb grandkids like these movies."

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.580
Oh, and the suit is covering up something,

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:36.400
because the person in a suit is always a big part of the government cover-up that somehow nobody ever figures out,

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:41.540
despite there apparently being millions of times the Transformers pretty much created our history.

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.680
Hell, even some of the city fights in the other films were somehow covered up.

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:51.400
As if even the government would be stupid enough to tell us not to trust our own eyes and ears -- actually it's not too far fetched.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.060
Optimus Prime, who's always the biggest one on the poster,

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:58.020
once again won't be the main lead; that will again be the human characters,

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:00.240
even though the movie's not called "Humans."

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.720
He'll be out of commission a good chunk of the movie, either hiding or looking for something.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:07.580
If he's in space, he's probably looking for someone or something from his homeworld, because...

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:10.000
shitty sci-fi loves to do that in bad sequels.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.800
But some evil force comes along that's after some power energy thing.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:20.020
Yeah, there's always some power energy thing; it's very vague in how it works, but whoever has it, can do some big damage.

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:28.640
The big threat won't be Megatron, though, because we love having the Transformer's biggest villain in most of these movies without having him in most of the movie.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:32.660
He'll still be a nuisance but only second banana to the big bad alien villain.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:41.240
Is the big bad alien villain a slimy creature or an orb of light or some sort of evil creature that's on par with H.R. Giger's design?

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:48.340
No!  It's just another human-looking machine that's riding a giant ship or metal device that's going to blow up everything.

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:51.060
Oh, and it has to do something on the moon, because...

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.780
For some reason, Michael Bay is really obsessed with the moon.

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:56.860
I, I, I mean, it's fine, but it's th-the moon!

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:58.480
It's just the moon!

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:03.300
With every passing movie they want to make Optimus Prime more and more badass so they make him meaner and meaner,

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:07.000
so this time around they'll probably go all the way and make you think he's a bad guy.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.660
Because when a series runs out of steam, that's a twist they always think we fall for.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:18.920
They'll even have some big fight with his best friend and he does the unthinkable by beating the shit out of him or even nearly killing him.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.400
They're going to make it seem like the friend is dead, but he's not!

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:27.280
It's another fake out, like when Optimus died, because they didn't have the balls that a Saturday morning cartoon had.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:35.000
So does this mean that Optimus Prime is a full-on villain, destroying years of hero worship in the ultimate franchise gamble?

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.500
Yes.  Yes, it is!  And Mickey Mouse is officially going to become a terrorist.

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:41.500
Of course that doesn't happen!

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:47.900
He's either brainwashed or controlled by the villain, but they'll figure out a way to make him think straight and he'll be good once more,

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:54.700
but after we have several scenes of asking if humanity's worth it.  Because you know, it was SO deep the other four times we did it.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.620
surely this time you won't forget!

00:08:56.620 --> 00:09:03.000
This will result in a lot of slow mo., a lot of explosions you won't even flinch at anymore because you've gotten so used to 'em.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.740
A situation where a hot guy flexes his muscles, a situation where a hot woman does something sexy,

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:15.320
something so outdatedly unfunny that will offend you on either a racial, sexual, or even just kindergarten level.

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:22.800
And all that action you think is going to be amazing and will throw in a lot of money into you're not going to be able to really enjoy, because...

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:29.920
you know, that Michael Bay, he's an artist, so he has to shoot the action sequences from different angles than what you're used to.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:36.180
The problem is he's not a very good artist, so it's either an angle that's so close you can't make out most of the action,

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:41.420
so cluttered you can't make out most of the action, or edited so fast that you can't make out most the action.

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:48.000
Even if you see it in 3D with all the slow mo, yeah, that great shard is really going to look different from the rest of the great shards.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:55.000
But it's okay, because you'll have two... maybe even three legitimately cool action moments that are only a few seconds long

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
but you can actually see them, so you'll choose to find it cool.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:04.580
You waited almost 3 hours of the exact same shit you've seen over and over, but those two minutes of actual good action,

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:08.380
somehow you'll justify in your head was completely worth it!

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:13.340
In the end, the main human characters will learn something about letting go yet somehow being closer;

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:19.140
Optimus Prime will make the same big speech that's trying to sound deep but is really just a long winded way of saying, "We rock";

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:25.060
the bad guy will be destroyed but some villainous element, usually Megatron, will escape for a sequel,

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:33.760
and even though every story, every setup, every bit of advertising is trying to make it look like this is going to be the last one,

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:36.120
IT'S NEVER THE LAST ONE!

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:40.640
"The Last Knight" is not the last film, "The Age of Extinction" has nothing becoming extinct,

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.980
"The Revenge of the Fallen" doesn't really last:

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:45.140
there's always, always more.

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:48.780
And if you keep thinking over and over that this IS going to be the last one, I eh, yeah,

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:50.000
there's going to be more!

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:55.840
So, what do you think?  Was I close?  Maybe, maybe not.

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:59.260
Maybe this is the one that's gonna break the mold.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.260
Maybe this will be the one that takes it in a brand new direction,

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.560
with twists and turns that are legitimately surprising,

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:08.420
but as the famous business model goes,

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:13.220
"If it's broken, but makes a lot of money, why fix it?"

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:19.240
My guess is this is the same movie they've shown us four times already, and here's the thing:

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.000
If you like this, fine.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.780
You can't help what you like.  Hell, I enjoy the first one despite it being so stupid.

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:32.860
But with so many films repeating the same thing over and over, and those films not doing as well as the studios want,

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:37.560
remember: You have the right to demand better.

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:44.200
You have a right to say, "If I'm going to see something that I'm already familiar with, I can at least demand to see something new with it."

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:50.000
You can be fine with the same old crap, but you can demand smarter and more exiting crap.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:57.560
We all have that fast food McDonald's garbage that we eat, but even McDonald's puts out a new sandwich every once in a while.

00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:01.340
You don't have to eat a shitty cheeseburger over and over and over.

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:03.000
You can demand a new sauce,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.280
a new meal, even a new restaurant.

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:07.540
The Rodeo burger is still amazing.

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:16.500
This is just a different take on a fascinatingly repetitive series, and I don't see myself doing it often or really ever again.

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:19.920
I'm a reviewer: I want to talk about what I see as opposed to what I don't see.

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:28.060
This is just something different, like I said, an artistic experiment, something I don't think we'll ever see the Transformer movies trying any time soon.

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:33.120
But the one thing I want you to take away from this, whether I'm right about most of this stuff or not,

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:39.660
is that if you're not going to demand something good, you can at LEAST demand something new.

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:44.340
I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it... whether you've seen it or not.
