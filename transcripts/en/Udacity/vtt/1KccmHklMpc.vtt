00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.380
So in our case of eye color, where we have a brown allele and a bue allele, it

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:08.308
turns out that our brown allele is dominant over our blue allele. And what this

00:00:08.308 --> 00:00:13.580
means is that it masks the effect of the blue allele so that you can't see it.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.252
Alternatively, the blue allele is referred to as recessive, because it's effect

00:00:17.252 --> 00:00:22.050
is masked when there is a dominant allele present. And we can show that here by

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.328
putting the blue allele inside the brown allele. Whereas the end product is we

00:00:26.328 --> 00:00:30.592
can only see the result of the dominant allele. So, in this case, what color

00:00:30.592 --> 00:00:33.240
eyes do you think the offspring would have?

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.600
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Brown, since brown is the dominant allele.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.464
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Exactly.
