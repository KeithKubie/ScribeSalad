00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.464
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:06.705 --> 00:00:08.830
HANNAH SONG: Thank you guys
so much for being here.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.300
As Alyssa mentioned, I'm
the CEO of an organization

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.740
called Liberty in North Korea.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.440
We're an international
NGO, as mentioned,

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.020
and we focus a bulk of our
work in working directly

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.340
with the North Korean people.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.810
And I'll share a little bit
more at the end of my talk,

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.820
in terms of what
exactly it is that we do

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.196
and why you should probably
get involved with helping us.

00:00:26.196 --> 00:00:28.153
So the first slide that's
going to come up here

00:00:28.153 --> 00:00:29.550
is actually a well known image.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.189
It's a satellite image--
here we go-- of North Korea.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.850
And so this is the
country we're going

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.890
to be talking about here today.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.320
And as you can see,
most of this country

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.550
is completely blacked out.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.070
To me, when I see this photo,
what it represents actually

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.900
is the fact that there is
tremendous economic and social

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.720
progress that South
Korea has achieved

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.550
in such a short period of time.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.540
And if the conditions
permitted, that North Korea,

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.840
too, could actually achieve
the same type of progress.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.890
Because it has the same
potential as South Korea.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.220
But the conditions don't exist
today for that to be possible.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.400
And the reason why is
because of the government.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.330
So instead, 24
million North Koreans

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.330
today live in one of the
most closed and repressive

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:17.630
countries.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.500
And they face this
repressive government

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.210
that prioritizes absolute
political control and regime

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.170
sustainability at the cost
of completely stifling

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.940
the North Korean
people's potential.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.524
So a lot of times
people will ask,

00:01:34.524 --> 00:01:36.440
how is it that the North
Korean government has

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.670
been able to maintain such
tight control over such

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.120
a long period of time?

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.230
The North Korean
government, more

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:44.940
than any other
authoritarian government

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.100
throughout world
history, has been

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.590
most successful in being
able to maintain control

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.240
for such a long period of
time because of the fact

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.620
that they place such a
high priority and emphasis

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.610
on controlling the informational
and ideational environment

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.980
inside of that country
as a key strategy

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.420
in order to control
the way people behave

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.500
and what they think.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.741
This is how they try
to control society.

00:02:07.741 --> 00:02:09.449
And so as you can see,
and as many of you

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:13.110
may already be aware,
the North Korean people--

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.360
in terms of their information
environment, North Korea

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.680
is the most closed in the world.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.710
The government maintains control
by maintaining a monopoly

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.580
as a single source of
information and ideas

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.950
inside of that country.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.660
So, for example, all
television and radio sets

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.420
are set to receive only
government broadcasts.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.130
There is no internet access
inside of that country,

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.760
with the exception of
a few select elite.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.950
And-- sorry.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.880
Phones inside of North
Korea, North Korean phones,

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.410
cannot call internationally.

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.454
They cannot make call
outside of that country.

00:02:51.454 --> 00:02:53.620
And so these are some of
the ways in which the North

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.380
Korean government has
placed such a high priority

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.399
on controlling the
information environment

00:02:58.399 --> 00:03:00.440
and keeping the North
Korean people intentionally

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.620
closed off from
the outside world.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.610
But on top of that, the
North Korean government

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:11.520
also pumps an inordinate amount
of propaganda and ideology,

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.730
from a very young age, into
the North Korean people,

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.056
in a form of extreme
indoctrination.

00:03:16.056 --> 00:03:18.680
And so because of this, this is
how the North Korean government

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.650
has been able to control North
Korean society for so long.

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.670
In addition, there is
a zero tolerance policy

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.024
for any form of
political dissent.

00:03:31.024 --> 00:03:33.440
And this is enforced through
a network of political prison

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.520
camps inside North Korea.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.200
These camps are very
reminiscent of the Soviet gulags

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.890
in the Nazi concentration camps.

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.070
The conditions are
absolutely horrific.

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.470
About two years
ago, in 2014, the UN

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.970
published a report after
a year long investigation

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.060
into allegations of
crimes against humanity

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.900
that were being
committed in that country

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.996
by the government
against its own people.

00:03:57.996 --> 00:04:00.120
So what the report found
was that the gravity scale

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.690
and nature of these
human rights violations

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.220
reveals a state that does
not have any parallel

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.270
in the contemporary world.

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.210
Crimes against
humanity in North Korea

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:13.020
entail extermination,
murder, enslavement, torture,

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.580
imprisonment, rape,
forced abortions

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.880
and other sexual
violence, persecution

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.279
on political religious,
racial and gender grounds,

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:23.690
the forcible transfer
of populations,

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.520
the enforced
disappearance of persons,

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.100
and the inhumane act
of knowingly causing

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.930
prolonged starvation.

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.400
So this sets the stage for
the type of environment

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.080
that the everyday North
Korean people face inside

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.940
of the country.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.400
This gives us a glimpse at
the amount of repression

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.530
that the North
Korean people face.

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:49.010
But despite this, what
we do have hope in

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.250
is the fact that despite
these tremendous challenges

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.540
that the North
Korean people face,

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.390
it makes the situation
seem impossible,

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.440
but many changes have
actually been happening

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.060
over the last two decades
that point to social changes

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.776
and trends that
can give us hope.

00:05:03.776 --> 00:05:05.400
That there is in fact
change happening,

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.140
and it's coming from
a grassroots level,

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.390
and it's being driven by
the North Korean people.

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.856
But in order to understand
how these changes came about,

00:05:11.856 --> 00:05:14.230
we have to go back to a very
tragic time in North Korea's

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.870
history in the '90s, when
North Korea experienced

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.455
a severe famine-- one of the
worst of the 20th century--

00:05:19.455 --> 00:05:22.080
where it's estimated that up to
a million North Koreans starved

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.060
to death in that country.

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.890
One of those people
being Joseph's father,

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:29.330
and you'll hear more
about his story today.

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.410
But out of this tragedy
emerged an opportunity.

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.670
And what you saw
was the emergence

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:37.420
of grassroots markets.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.520
People decided, as a
survival mechanism,

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.260
to take matters into
their own hands.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.162
And they were able to go
out and to begin to trade

00:05:45.162 --> 00:05:46.620
and to get the
goods and the things

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.536
that they needed for
themselves and for others

00:05:48.536 --> 00:05:51.036
that the government could no
longer provide for themselves--

00:05:51.036 --> 00:05:53.244
that the government could
no longer provide for them,

00:05:53.244 --> 00:05:55.120
or that they wouldn't
provide for them.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.830
So what we saw
happening was actually,

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:58.840
with this grassroots
marketization

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.280
and the proliferation
of these markets,

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.340
was actually North Korean
people taking matters

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:04.480
into their own hands.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.050
And before the 1990s, before
this famine, what you saw

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:09.650
was that the state was central
to the North Korean people.

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.930
It provided everything to
the people-- information,

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.420
technology, food, ideology.

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.530
And then what happened was
this shift after the '90s,

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:19.730
after the proliferation
of these markets,

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:22.870
and people being empowered
through these markets instead

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.930
to be able to then access the
things that they needed apart

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:27.080
from the state.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.750
The shift is very significant.

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:30.690
Because these markets
became a catalyst

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:32.610
for North Korean
people, actually,

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:35.460
in order to now utilize
the markets as also

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.910
a grounds for which they
could then exchange ideas,

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:41.240
and information, and even
technologies that were actually

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.890
helping to accelerate
the erosion of ideology

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:45.490
of the state.

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:47.570
So the markets are
very important-- are

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:50.100
very important in terms
of some of these changes

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.430
in social trends that we see
emerging over the last two

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:52.930
decades.

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:59.742
So some of these major trends
that we recognize are here.

00:06:59.742 --> 00:07:01.700
The loss of control of
the economy and the rise

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:02.460
of capitalism.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:05.520
North Korea today is
essentially a market economy.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.427
Many people are
not aware of that.

00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:09.760
The second is the weakening
of North Korea's information

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.090
blockade and the introduction of
unofficial foreign information.

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:15.130
Again, the markets
became a place

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:17.750
where foreign information
and illegal foreign media

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:20.850
were coming in through devices
and through technologies

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:23.490
like USBs and DVDs that
people were smuggling,

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:25.870
and brokers are smuggling in
and that are being traded,

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.930
and are being viewed and
shared across the country.

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:30.480
The third is
widespread corruption.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.855
And this corruption
is important,

00:07:31.855 --> 00:07:35.120
because it enables all of
these things to happen.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:38.060
Fourth is the emergence of human
networks outside of government

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:41.095
controlled space and
normalized shared disobedience.

00:07:41.095 --> 00:07:42.470
And this is very
important, also,

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:44.120
because there is
no civil society

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.440
in North Korea--
intentionally, as a way

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.260
in which the government has
set up the system within.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.740
But as a result
of the markets, it

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:54.039
gave an opportunity,
a platform, for people

00:07:54.039 --> 00:07:55.580
to be able to connect
with each other

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:57.060
and to develop bonds of trust.

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.110
And this is also very important.

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:01.900
Fifth is the rise of the
Jangmadang generation.

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.770
This is the equivalent of
North Korean millennials.

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:07.610
And they are a
whole new generation

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:09.540
of young people in
this country that

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:11.340
have a very different
relationship

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:13.548
with the government and the
state than their parents'

00:08:13.548 --> 00:08:14.090
generation.

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:16.048
Because they grew up in
a time where they never

00:08:16.048 --> 00:08:20.030
relied on the state and never
received anything from them.

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:22.296
And the last is the
impact of defectors

00:08:22.296 --> 00:08:23.670
who have resettled
in South Korea

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:25.769
but maintain contact with
their home communities.

00:08:25.769 --> 00:08:27.310
So since I don't
have time to expound

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:28.726
on all of these,
what I want to do

00:08:28.726 --> 00:08:30.810
is actually talk primarily
about number six,

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:32.150
the impact of defectors.

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:33.650
Because this is the
key area of work

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:34.980
that our organization does.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.100
So as a result of many of these
challenges that North Korean

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.970
people face, in addition
to the famine that

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:43.940
happened in the '90s,
we began to really see

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:47.180
a flow of North Koreans
leaving that country in the mid

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:48.180
to late '90s.

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:50.850
And they've continued
to come out since then.

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:53.580
This here outlines the path
that North Korean refugees

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:55.270
will take in their escape.

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:58.350
And you'll see it's a little bit
crazy, because right below them

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:00.490
is South Korea, their
final destination-- most

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:01.670
of their final destinations.

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:04.160
But because of the DMZ, one
of the most heavily fortified

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.535
borders in the
world, they're not

00:09:05.535 --> 00:09:07.050
able to cross
through that border.

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:10.240
So instead, they escape
into neighboring China

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.950
and then try to
make their way out

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:14.760
through this sort of modern
day Underground Railroad,

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.030
which is about 3,500
miles long and takes them

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:19.230
from the border there
of China and North Korea

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:20.710
all the way to Southeast Asia.

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:24.020
That's longer than the
distance of New York and LA.

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:25.800
And so this is the
underground route

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.960
that many North
Koreans have taken.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.520
In fact, tens of
thousands of them

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:32.870
have taken over the
last decade and a half.

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:34.570
And so what we see
here, actually,

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:36.310
is that once they
get into China,

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:37.800
this is not an easy route.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.470
This is not an easy journey.

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:41.310
The Chinese government
does not recognize

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:43.160
North Koreans as refugees.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.950
Instead, they claim that
they are economic migrants

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:48.200
and that they have
the right to be

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.150
able to find them, arrest
them, and forcibly send them

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:52.510
back to North Korea.

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:54.160
And if North Koreans
have illegally

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:57.140
left that country, as
almost all of these refugees

00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:00.930
have, and they are forcibly
sent back, many of them

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:03.260
could face severe punishment
upon being sent back

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:04.710
into North Korea.

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:07.600
And so the situation for them
in China is extremely dangerous.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:11.000
And this is really where
organizations like ours,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.380
other missionaries,
NGOs, and even

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:16.040
brokers in the underground,
are able to step in

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.427
and to help North Koreans
who are there, who are

00:10:18.427 --> 00:10:19.635
at high risk of exploitation.

00:10:19.635 --> 00:10:22.010
You know, at the peak of
when refugees were leaving

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:24.440
that country in the
early 2000s, you

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.970
saw thousands leaving every year
and making it to South Korea.

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:32.520
At that time, it was
estimated that 70% to 80%

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:36.010
of female North Korean refugees
were being trafficked or sold

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:39.040
because of how at risk they
were, at risk of exploitation.

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:39.990
They had no rights.

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:42.570
They had no one to protect
them in that country.

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:45.660
Today, the paths in which
people are coming through

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:47.630
have become a lot
more established.

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:50.052
There are more organizations,
and there are groups,

00:10:50.052 --> 00:10:52.260
and there are family members
who have already made it

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.140
out that are able to facilitate
for their way to come out

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:57.260
quicker, sooner faster, safer.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.256
And there are also more
people, like you guys,

00:10:59.256 --> 00:11:01.630
that are supporting those
efforts on the backend in order

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:06.130
to help more people to make it
out safely and more quickly.

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:10.600
So one of the most
important reasons

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:13.270
why we work with
North Korean refugees

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:15.880
is not only because of the
humanitarian imperative

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:18.090
and the opportunity that
we have to help them,

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:21.760
but also because of the fact
that North Korean refugees are

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.480
playing one of the most
important roles on this issue.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:27.600
And it's a unique role that only
they can play, that none of us

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:28.350
can play.

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:31.000
And that's because, of the
30,000 North Koreans that

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.190
have resettled in
South Korea today,

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:35.209
it's estimated that
more than 50% of them

00:11:35.209 --> 00:11:37.500
have been able to reestablish
contact with their family

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.200
members inside of that country.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.522
And they do so through
illicit Chinese cell

00:11:41.522 --> 00:11:43.480
phones that have been
smuggled into the border.

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:44.896
And it's through
that that they're

00:11:44.896 --> 00:11:46.990
able to communicate with
their family members,

00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:49.870
sharing and sending information
in and out of that country

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:52.020
through these relationships.

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:55.140
But secondary is also
the flow of money.

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:57.130
This community of
North Korean defectors

00:11:57.130 --> 00:12:02.930
sends, on average, anywhere
from about $15 million a year--

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:05.650
$15 million a year
back into that country

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:07.700
to their family members.

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:10.656
And that money is crucial in
accelerating these changes

00:12:10.656 --> 00:12:12.280
that we believe are
happening-- that we

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:15.160
know are happening, these
very important social changes.

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.716
It's accelerating this
grassroots marketization.

00:12:17.716 --> 00:12:19.340
It's providing for
their family members

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:22.040
to enable them to buy the goods
and the things that they need.

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:24.390
And it's also enabling
their families

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:26.320
to invest in their
own market activities

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:27.340
to protect themselves.

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:29.010
It's increasing their
family's ability

00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:31.450
for more human security.

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:33.600
And this map here, the
hot spots of change,

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.340
are areas where
we believe change

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:37.130
is happening at a faster rate.

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:39.650
And a large part of that
being because of the fact

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:42.650
that these are key areas where
defectors have come from,

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:44.820
and where money and
information is flowing back

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:46.360
into that country.

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.540
So we have an
opportunity to work

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:50.740
with more North Korean
defectors and refugees,

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:52.600
helping them not
only in their escape,

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.530
but empowering them
in their resettlement.

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:56.850
The more successful
they can become,

00:12:56.850 --> 00:12:59.500
the more opportunities
that they have in order

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:01.360
to be agents of
change on this issue.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.680
And we truly believe
that North Korea

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:06.850
is one of the most difficult
challenges facing humanity

00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:09.240
today, but that the
North Korean people

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:12.010
are the best solution for that.

00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:14.580
And, you know, I think one of
the opportunities we have here

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:18.100
today is to listen to
the story of Joseph Kim.

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:22.397
And it's such an honor to have
him here to share his story.

00:13:22.397 --> 00:13:23.980
If you're not familiar
with his story,

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:25.271
I think you'll be very touched.

00:13:25.271 --> 00:13:29.062
And I've had a chance to
know Joseph since 2007,

00:13:29.062 --> 00:13:31.020
when he first arrived
here in the United States

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:35.060
as a refugee-- as a URM, a
non-accompanied refugee minor.

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:37.030
And it was really
through meeting

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:40.670
Joseph that really brought me
even further into this issue.

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:42.310
Because as you hear
Joseph speak you'll

00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:45.950
get to know that, despite
the incredible challenges

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:48.960
that he has overcome, and
despite the tremendous things

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.610
that he's had to witness
and do in order to survive,

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:53.850
in order to make it to
this point in his life,

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:58.720
he is one of the most tenacious,
incredible, gentle and kind

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:01.100
people that you will ever meet.

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:03.619
And so it's my
honor and privilege

00:14:03.619 --> 00:14:06.160
to introduce you guys to Joseph
Kim, who's here with us here,

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:07.790
to share his story.

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:13.040
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.955
I made you nervous now, huh?

00:14:18.955 --> 00:14:21.870
[LAUGHS]

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:23.790
JOSEPH KIM: Yes, very nervous.

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:28.419
Thank you for the kind words.

00:14:28.419 --> 00:14:30.210
HANNAH SONG: Joseph's
like a brother to me,

00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:34.920
so he knows that my goal here
was to try to embarrass him

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:36.486
a little bit.

00:14:36.486 --> 00:14:38.142
JOSEPH KIM: You succeed.

00:14:38.142 --> 00:14:39.100
HANNAH SONG: Very good.

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:40.330
Very good.

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:41.870
So what I wanted
to do was actually

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:44.445
start off with a few questions.

00:14:44.445 --> 00:14:47.070
Just because I'm sure there are
questions that all of you have,

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:48.380
so that Joseph can
share his story.

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:49.921
And then we'll make
sure that we have

00:14:49.921 --> 00:14:53.110
some time at the end to open
it up for some Q&amp;A, as well.

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:57.360
So to start off, Joseph,
can you share a little bit

00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:00.300
about your life in North Korea?

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:02.600
JOSEPH KIM: Sure.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:06.830
I've been asked for the same
question for so many times,

00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:09.690
but every single
time I struggle.

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:12.670
I find it challenging
to answer it.

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:17.500
Because I think mainly there
was so many things happened,

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:21.120
and I don't know where to begin.

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:27.820
But before I first say anything
about my life in North Korea,

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:33.130
I also wanted to say that,
even though it's probably

00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:35.750
one of the darkest
places in the word,

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:40.550
it is still a place-- well,
it's so close to my heart,

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:45.510
because it's a place
where I first experienced

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:49.430
or taste what happiness was.

00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:56.070
I remember-- I was
the youngest child

00:15:56.070 --> 00:16:00.000
and the only son in the family,
and my mom was always sick.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.320
So she didn't have much energy
to play with me during the day.

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:08.830
And my sister, who was
seven years older than me,

00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:15.000
so she was always in school by
the time I was five years old.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:21.230
And my father was working during
the day, so I was always alone.

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:25.220
Sometimes I was hanging
out with my friends

00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:27.660
near in my neighborhood.

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:31.320
But I remember the happiest
moment for me, I think,

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:35.240
was whenever I went out on the
street waiting for my sister

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:36.520
to come back.

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:39.030
And I mean, I was very young.

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:42.620
I didn't know what direction
she was going to come from.

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:46.470
But I do remember what
she wear in the morning

00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:48.880
before she went to school.

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:55.200
It was the school uniform with
white shirts with a blue skirt.

00:16:55.200 --> 00:17:00.190
So there I was, five years old.

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:04.650
I was sitting on the street
just waiting for her.

00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:07.539
And whenever I saw people
who were approaching

00:17:07.539 --> 00:17:10.940
with that same
color of uniforms,

00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:14.520
I always was excited that
that would be my sister.

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:17.710
And sometimes I
got disappointed,

00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:19.190
because it was not my sister.

00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:24.130
But my sister eventually
came, and I just

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:28.780
remember the moments that I was
so excited to play with her.

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:33.650
And she was probably one of the
nicest and kind-- the most kind

00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:37.490
sister I have ever can ask for.

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:42.680
And she would always
read me stories that she

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.800
read or learned in class.

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:49.960
And I always loved being with
her and playing with her.

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:53.430
And she was just like
another mother to me.

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:58.230
So that was like my
earliest childhood memory,

00:17:58.230 --> 00:17:59.830
of being loved.

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:03.350
And my father, of
course, he would always

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:06.330
pick me up first when
he came back from work.

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:10.020
And he would sometimes take
me to an ice cream store

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:16.310
nearby my house and buy me ice
creams along with some cookies.

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:19.810
And those are my earliest
childhood memories,

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:24.150
which I think I appreciate.

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:26.328
I'm grateful to
have it, because--

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:35.350
But the great
famine began later.

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:41.360
And that totally changed my
life as tired [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:44.050
for my entire family.

00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:50.170
I started notice that grownups
are whispering, or talking

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:55.970
about a grandfather nearby my
neighborhood died of hunger.

00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:58.734
And at the time, I
didn't know what that

00:18:58.734 --> 00:19:00.450
was, what that really meant.

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:04.870
But I think, even as a
child, you could kind of

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:11.850
read the worrisome, or the
anxieties, from your parents.

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:16.650
I think those are
noticeable, even for a child.

00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:19.620
And I didn't know
what it was, but I

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:24.840
knew things were not
as great as before.

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:31.760
And of course my family also
was affected by the famine.

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:38.980
When I was 12 years old, my
father also died of starvation.

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:43.340
It was my first time
ever witnessing someone

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:46.860
dying away in front
of me, especially

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:49.560
someone who was so close to me.

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:54.210
In the same year,
my mom and my sister

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:58.040
decided to go to
China to look for food

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:02.610
and possibly earn some
money to come back.

00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:07.890
My sister and I had never
been-- lived separately.

00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:12.920
And I always thought that
she would be by my side

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:15.230
all the time.

00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:19.380
And she-- before she
was leaving to China,

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:23.820
she had promised me that
she would-- she would not

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:29.240
make me wait for too long, and
she would come back shortly

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:30.520
afterward.

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:35.240
And that was the last
time I saw my sister.

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:43.130
In China, what happened was that
my mom didn't have much choice.

00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:46.640
But she had to let my sister go.

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:50.680
What I mean by
this is that my mom

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:55.970
had to send my sister
to a Chinese man

00:20:55.970 --> 00:21:00.076
so that at least that
she could be saved.

00:21:00.076 --> 00:21:03.810
She could-- and I
think she thought

00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:07.430
that that would be a better
life for her than going back

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:12.380
to North Korea, where,
if she was caught,

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:15.400
then she could face
severe punishment.

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.710
And I think, as
a mother, I think

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:23.930
that was probably the--
it was the only option she

00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:27.760
had, but also was the
best option for her.

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:29.820
And, of course,
my mother did not

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:33.020
know about the sex
trafficking industries.

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:34.620
She didn't aware of it.

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:39.480
And I don't know, even to
this day, where my sister is.

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:42.520
But my mom came back.

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:49.870
And, you know, it was her
decision to at least save me

00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:51.940
from another starvation.

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:56.420
And my mom came back
to explain to me why

00:21:56.420 --> 00:22:00.490
that my sister wasn't with her.

00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:01.740
I mean, I was very young.

00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:04.120
It was very hard to process.

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:08.430
I think-- for that reason,
I think, for a long time,

00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:11.950
I had a love and hate
relationship with my mom.

00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:17.500
But now that I
have become adult,

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:24.070
I think I can at least
understand a little bit.

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:29.570
And my mother,
[INAUDIBLE] later, she

00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:33.210
was trying to go back to
China to look for my sister,

00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:35.950
but she was caught
in North Korea.

00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:39.710
And as a result, she
was put-- she was

00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:43.980
sent a jail, or prison camp.

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:51.040
And that was also my
last time I saw my mom.

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:58.590
And that left me as a homeless,
an orphan on the street.

00:22:58.590 --> 00:23:05.520
It was-- I always had seen
homeless kids, children,

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:08.210
begging on the
street, but I never

00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:13.060
thought that would be-- one
day I would become one of them.

00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:15.390
And I think one of
the hardest part

00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:22.240
was learn how to give up
my pride and personality,

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:28.630
and be able to ask for
leftover soup from strangers.

00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:30.950
But I had to do
it, and I did it,

00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:38.390
because I noticed
that kids who were not

00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:45.800
being able to ask, or find that
courage to ask for leftover

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:48.360
food, they were
slowly dying away.

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:52.030
And I was scared.

00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:58.060
And I realized that others
would face similar destiny

00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:00.830
if I don't speak up.

00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:05.420
I also used to work
in a coal mine.

00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:08.250
I remember the
grownups were-- they

00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:10.980
were having
difficult lives, too,

00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:18.240
but I think they were so sad
for me, or at least sympathized.

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:21.830
They were just-- I think they
were trying to find the easiest

00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:26.510
job a 14-year-old kid can.

00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:29.980
So that was how I lived.

00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:34.200
And now I ask myself,
or in retrospect, I

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:39.950
think one of the reasons why
I was able to keep up and keep

00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:43.460
fighting was that I had
never given up on the hope

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:46.490
that I would be able
to see my sister again.

00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:54.170
And I, every night before
I went to bed-- by bed,

00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:57.720
I mean like find a
place under the bridge--

00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:00.970
with an empty stomach,
I always dreamed

00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:04.550
or hoped that my sister would
come back the next morning.

00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:11.420
And I think that kind of hope
gave me strength to survive.

00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:17.990
So that basically sums up
how-- what was it like.

00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:22.420
HANNAH SONG: So you
experienced a lot

00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:28.090
of very difficult-- very
difficult things at such

00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:28.910
a young age.

00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:34.150
And you made the decision to
go to China when you were 15.

00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:35.790
Is that right?

00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:39.460
So can you explain a
little bit about why

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:42.910
you decided to finally
leave North Korea,

00:25:42.910 --> 00:25:48.500
and you know how dangerous
it is to leave North Korea.

00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:51.920
JOSEPH KIM: So there
is a list at the time.

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:56.490
In 2006, there were
two different ways

00:25:56.490 --> 00:25:57.990
to escape North Korea.

00:25:57.990 --> 00:26:03.090
One where you bribe the
soldiers, or the river

00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:08.390
guards, and you go to China.

00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:12.800
But of course that price-- the
cost of that amount of money

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:16.010
that you have to
give to soldiers is--

00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:18.050
it's a lot of money
that I didn't have.

00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:20.310
And if I had that
much of money, I

00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:27.420
would not even-- I would not
take the risk of escaping.

00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:31.100
The reason why I decided
to take that risk,

00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:39.483
even though I knew
how dangerous it

00:26:39.483 --> 00:26:42.650
was, I had to make
that decision,

00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:46.660
because it was my
last try to survive.

00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:52.950
And I lived as a homeless
for over three years,

00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:56.900
and I just did not see
any hope to survive.

00:26:56.900 --> 00:27:08.350
And I knew that, if I do stay,
I would eventually also-- I

00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:14.800
didn't know what my future
was and was going to be.

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:19.230
And I thought it was about time.

00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:20.980
I mean, I didn't
have much choice.

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:25.310
It was either I would
sit down and wait

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:30.310
until I die of
starvations, or at least

00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:33.800
take that risk to go to
China to look for my sister.

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:40.860
So I decided to
leave North Korea.

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:43.230
And I didn't have
money to bribe,

00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:45.610
so I just tried out of nowhere.

00:27:45.610 --> 00:27:51.590
And very fortunately,
I made it to China.

00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:57.500
And I was able to escape
North Korea successfully.

00:27:57.500 --> 00:28:03.570
And I think, going into
China, my expectation

00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:12.810
was to find the man
who had sold my sister,

00:28:12.810 --> 00:28:16.330
or brokered, or made the
transaction between my mom

00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:17.690
and the Chinese man.

00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:20.900
So I was hoping to find him.

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:24.880
But I realized that by the
time I went to his house,

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:31.900
he passed away just about
one days before my arrival.

00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:36.060
And I didn't know what to
do, because my plan was not

00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:37.870
to live in China.

00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:43.530
My plan was to look for my
sister, and find some money,

00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:45.320
and go back to North Korea.

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:50.670
I don't know, I can't
explain why, I was always--

00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:51.830
I thought that way.

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:57.180
But I always thought that I
had to live in North Korea.

00:28:57.180 --> 00:29:00.780
I'd never thought of
living somewhere else.

00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:05.450
And that's why I also didn't
bring any family pictures.

00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:09.490
Because my initial plan
was to meet my sister

00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:12.100
and go back to North Korea.

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:14.320
But of course, I
couldn't find my sister.

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:17.960
And I think-- in
Korean, there is a term

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:23.390
that, when you are so hopeless
the sky turns to-- turns

00:29:23.390 --> 00:29:25.150
into yellow color.

00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:28.240
I know it doesn't make sense.

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:32.170
But I think, for me, I
didn't even have the strength

00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:33.690
to look up sky.

00:29:33.690 --> 00:29:41.440
Because I, certainly,
did not plan after.

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:45.050
I did not think
that I-- what to do.

00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:46.260
I didn't know what to do.

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:53.130
And I think it was just probably
one of the most difficult time

00:29:53.130 --> 00:29:57.616
that-- in my life, I think.

00:29:57.616 --> 00:29:59.490
HANNAH SONG: Can you
talk a little bit, then,

00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:01.390
about why you stayed
in China then,

00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:02.880
and what life was like in China?

00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:10.600
I mean, essentially, you
didn't go back to North Korea.

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:11.910
You ended up here in the US.

00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:16.900
So how did you
find your way here?

00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:22.490
JOSEPH KIM: My first two weeks,
it was during the wintertime.

00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:27.860
And I went house to
house, door to door,

00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:32.030
for leftover food in
the mornings and nights.

00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:33.940
And during the
days, I would sleep

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:37.030
in the mountains
or abandonded house

00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:40.325
in the rural areas in China.

00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:50.030
The reason why I kept
staying was that at least I

00:30:50.030 --> 00:30:53.152
could find some food.

00:30:53.152 --> 00:30:59.370
And if I go back to
North Korea, first, there

00:30:59.370 --> 00:31:03.840
is a huge possibility
that I would be caught.

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:07.330
And secondly, even
if I don't get caught

00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:10.530
and I sneak back
into North Korea,

00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:16.930
there were no promising
futures or options that I had.

00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:22.830
And later on that I learned that
Christian churches, when I go,

00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:25.820
they give some helps.

00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:28.130
In the first church
I went, they give me

00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:32.770
some food and clothing,
along with $2o-- no,

00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:37.140
no 20 yen in Chinese.

00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:41.820
And I thought that-- at
the time, I was like,

00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:44.640
oh, maybe if I go
to 10 churches,

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:48.535
I will have 200 yen, which
is probably equivalent

00:31:48.535 --> 00:31:52.530
to less than $30 US.

00:31:52.530 --> 00:31:55.810
But it was big enough.

00:31:55.810 --> 00:32:02.920
It was enough money for me
to at least go back to China

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:08.670
and have some-- I
would not-- at least

00:32:08.670 --> 00:32:14.440
I would live multiple
months without working.

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:18.860
But of course, it turned
out that not every churches

00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:21.520
give $20, I mean, 20 yen.

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:25.090
So that plan totally crashed.

00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:36.220
And later on, I found-- a church
in China offered me to stay,

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:36.900
live there.

00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:40.570
And while I was living
there, the church people

00:32:40.570 --> 00:32:45.860
were looking for sponsors
who would potentially

00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:51.530
take me to their home and
give me a shelter and food.

00:32:51.530 --> 00:33:01.250
I think one of the conditions
to be-- to go with a sponsor

00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:05.860
that I met in China
was to change my name.

00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:12.188
I was asked change
my name as Joseph.

00:33:12.188 --> 00:33:19.420
And only if I do then I would
be sponsored, I would be helped.

00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:22.510
I thought about
it, at the moment.

00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:25.410
It was very difficult,
and it was very emotional.

00:33:25.410 --> 00:33:29.700
Because growing
up in North Korea,

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:32.530
especially up till
I became homeless,

00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:35.300
I pretty much gave
up everything that I

00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:42.720
had-- human dignity,
personal pride, personality,

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:43.930
that didn't matter.

00:33:43.930 --> 00:33:48.880
My concern, day to day, was
to find for the next meal.

00:33:53.010 --> 00:33:58.790
But only one thing that kept me,
or remind me, that I was still

00:33:58.790 --> 00:34:02.380
a person, I was still a human
being, was that the name

00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:04.710
that I got it from my father.

00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:09.170
And that was the only thing
that my father had left me.

00:34:09.170 --> 00:34:12.360
And that was the only
thing that I had been

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:16.050
able to protect or preserve.

00:34:16.050 --> 00:34:20.540
So momentarily, I
asked myself, do

00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:24.900
I really have to even
give up my name too,

00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:28.659
so that I could survive?

00:34:28.659 --> 00:34:32.010
Just get some food
and place to sleep?

00:34:32.010 --> 00:34:32.929
I thought about it.

00:34:32.929 --> 00:34:38.860
But then, as a 16-year-old kids,
I mean, what choice did I have?

00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:40.850
There was not much I could do.

00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:45.570
I could either go back
to North Korea, facing so

00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:51.000
many uncertainties, or-- yeah.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:59.800
So I decided, for the moment
being, let me-- let's leave.

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:04.040
Let's try to live this life
and see where it takes.

00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:09.110
So I decided to change,
accept the conditions.

00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:12.380
And you might be
wondering why did I keep

00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:16.080
my name as Joseph in America.

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:20.210
The reason why I kept
my name as Joseph

00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:25.650
is that it turned out to be that
the sponsor who had taken me

00:35:25.650 --> 00:35:34.830
to their house was one of the
really-- one of the most kind

00:35:34.830 --> 00:35:38.770
person, who genuinely
wanted to help me.

00:35:38.770 --> 00:35:47.780
And I thought that one
way to honor her sacrifice

00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:49.640
was to keep my name as Joseph.

00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:53.390
And that's how I kept
my name as Joseph.

00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:56.970
HANNAH SONG: So
because of time, I'm

00:35:56.970 --> 00:36:00.990
going to just fast
forward a little bit here.

00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:03.360
North Korea-- the way that
Joseph came out, actually,

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:06.840
in 2006, it was, is a
little bit different

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:09.650
than the way in which
I had described here.

00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:11.850
Because he had come
out-- in early 2000s,

00:36:11.850 --> 00:36:14.220
a lot of North Koreans
that were in China

00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:17.820
were trying to go in
through various embassies

00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:19.420
and consulates in
China, in order

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:21.480
to try to leave the
country that way.

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:23.590
But that way became virtually
impossible later on,

00:36:23.590 --> 00:36:25.520
which is why more
North Koreans began

00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:28.210
to come out of the underground--
sort of Underground Railroad.

00:36:28.210 --> 00:36:30.300
But Joseph was an
individual who was

00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:34.220
able to go in through a
consulate, actually, in China.

00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:37.490
And after spending some
time in the underground

00:36:37.490 --> 00:36:41.166
with this incredible grandmother
that took care of him,

00:36:41.166 --> 00:36:42.790
he was connected to
our network, and we

00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:44.831
were able to help him to
get into this consulate.

00:36:44.831 --> 00:36:50.330
And that's how he was able to
get to the US-- come to the US

00:36:50.330 --> 00:36:52.180
as a refugee.

00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:54.410
So coming to the
United States, I

00:36:54.410 --> 00:36:55.785
guess one of the
last questions--

00:36:55.785 --> 00:36:58.118
because I want to make sure
we have some time for people

00:36:58.118 --> 00:36:59.160
to ask questions, too.

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:00.660
So I guess one of
the last questions

00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:05.000
that I'll ask you is, coming
to the US is so different.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.840
You know, this is
such a different place

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:10.490
than North Korea.

00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:15.390
When you first came to America,
what was it like for you?

00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:19.690
I mean, what was something that
was difficult, funny, strange,

00:37:19.690 --> 00:37:24.350
unusual for you in
coming here and learning

00:37:24.350 --> 00:37:27.700
about American culture?

00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:30.000
JOSEPH KIM: I think it was
another challenge in a sense

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.340
that I only-- I
knew how to survive,

00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:36.450
or I knew how to
find food, but I

00:37:36.450 --> 00:37:40.070
didn't know how to find of--
or learn about myself, I think.

00:37:40.070 --> 00:37:43.330
So that was one of the
challenging things.

00:37:43.330 --> 00:37:47.150
I think I-- everyone
told me that I

00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:50.820
have the complete freedom to
do whatever I wanted to do,

00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:54.910
but I really didn't know what
I wanted to do with my life.

00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:59.820
I think finding identity
and purpose for my life

00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:04.910
was probably-- it
was really difficult.

00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:07.350
But I think one
of the strangest,

00:38:07.350 --> 00:38:09.970
or the funniest thing
was that-- you know,

00:38:09.970 --> 00:38:14.090
when I was waiting in
American consulate in China,

00:38:14.090 --> 00:38:19.640
I decided to study some English
words with a Korean-English

00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:20.790
Dictionary.

00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:23.910
And I remember learning
a word the "subway."

00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:27.660
And subway [INAUDIBLE]
means in Korean dictionary,

00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:30.550
or definition of subway,
is the train stations

00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:32.230
we have in New York City.

00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:35.200
And I thought I knew what
they were, looked like.

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:39.970
So I ended up going
to Richmond, Virginia.

00:38:39.970 --> 00:38:43.150
That's where my
foster family was.

00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:49.000
And I remember my first time
going to a Subway sandwich

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:49.500
shop.

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:53.350
And I was thinking that--
I know this might be really

00:38:53.350 --> 00:38:59.520
stupid, for it's a true story.

00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:03.140
I went in, and I was
thinking, like, there

00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:07.890
is so many ways to connect
the underground, the trains.

00:39:07.890 --> 00:39:12.600
And I was like, I couldn't
find a [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:15.430
or a possible entrance
to the ground.

00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:16.894
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:18.850 --> 00:39:21.040
Yeah, I think-- I
was so confused.

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:24.704
And I just didn't
know what like--

00:39:24.704 --> 00:39:28.440
and I think that was
very confusing moment.

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:33.620
Because I was like, I guess
America is so developed

00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:37.540
that there is
invisible sort of ways

00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:41.570
to connect each Subway shops.

00:39:41.570 --> 00:39:43.110
That was probably one of the--

00:39:43.110 --> 00:39:44.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:46.070 --> 00:39:46.820
HANNAH SONG: Cool.

00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:49.040
Thanks for sharing
that story [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:50.600
JOSEPH KIM: So stupid.

00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:51.470
HANNAH SONG: No!

00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:54.340
You know what, I think there's
a lot of stories like that,

00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:56.950
even when-- like some of
our North Korean friends

00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:58.700
go to South Korea, and
the first time they

00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:00.500
go into Starbucks
they're so confused,

00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:04.230
because they have no idea what
like Americano or cappuccino--

00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:05.580
these are all foreign words.

00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:09.642
And so I think it's a great
experience for you to have.

00:40:09.642 --> 00:40:11.100
There's lots more
like that, so I'm

00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:13.490
sure you guys can ask
Joseph more about some

00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:14.490
of those experiences.

00:40:14.490 --> 00:40:19.020
But I wanted to actually open
it up for some questions,

00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:22.490
because I know that we only
have a little bit of time left.

00:40:22.490 --> 00:40:27.058
And so if anyone has a
question-- OK, great.

00:40:27.058 --> 00:40:29.770
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming.

00:40:29.770 --> 00:40:34.800
I think-- that was a very
kind of-- I don't [INAUDIBLE],

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:39.360
but very heartwarming and
kind of a somber story

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:42.170
that has a very good ending.

00:40:42.170 --> 00:40:43.050
Sure.

00:40:43.050 --> 00:40:46.880
But everything actually
seems like it worked out,

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:50.090
but I'm not sure
if like-- how is

00:40:50.090 --> 00:40:52.490
the situation for
those who are still--

00:40:52.490 --> 00:40:54.540
what is the majority situation?

00:40:54.540 --> 00:41:00.480
Like maybe looking
at one, or a few,

00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:02.210
and I'm feeling
very good about it.

00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:04.630
That, hey, something
is taken care of.

00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:05.754
But that's my thought.

00:41:05.754 --> 00:41:07.460
I'm not sure if
that is a question.

00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:09.200
My question is a little broader.

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:11.450
You're probably one of
the unique people who

00:41:11.450 --> 00:41:17.190
have-- in the whole world,
who have been in North Korea

00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:17.800
through China.

00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:22.230
And now you have seen
the United States.

00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:25.450
So in terms of that wide
difference that I'm seeing,

00:41:25.450 --> 00:41:26.390
like completely dark.

00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:28.740
I actually opened up
Google Maps and saw

00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:32.006
where is North Korea, because
I didn't see in that map.

00:41:32.006 --> 00:41:33.630
And then I realized,
oh, is that water?

00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:35.046
Is that North Korea
in the middle?

00:41:35.046 --> 00:41:39.170
So now I realize the
whole thing was black.

00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:44.514
So what can-- what's the
majority situation now?

00:41:44.514 --> 00:41:48.160
And another is, if
you think in terms

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:50.760
of the different
countries, what can they

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:53.498
learn from each other
about the human values

00:41:53.498 --> 00:41:59.320
and what are-- what are the
things at the last can people

00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:02.430
cling to and give them that
so that they don't completely

00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:03.782
destroy themselves?

00:42:03.782 --> 00:42:06.240
JOSEPH KIM: I will take
part of your answers.

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:10.820
I think that you raised a really
important questions, you know,

00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:14.010
that my life has been changed,
and I'm in a good place,

00:42:14.010 --> 00:42:16.990
but what about the others?

00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:22.260
You know, this is actually
challenging for me, as well.

00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:29.080
I think, for that
reason, I-- for example,

00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:31.580
like I should be
the first person

00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:36.350
to keep thinking about their
lives and sufferings every day.

00:42:36.350 --> 00:42:40.080
But in reality, I
think I'm mostly

00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:47.860
concerned with how to keep up
my grade GPA and how to pursue,

00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:50.240
or what to pursue.

00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:53.250
And I think, mostly,
I am concerned

00:42:53.250 --> 00:42:57.666
with my personal
visions and dreams.

00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:05.290
I think that's why I'm also
very interested in ethics

00:43:05.290 --> 00:43:06.980
and philosophy.

00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:12.890
But the reason why I
came out to this event,

00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:16.850
and the reason why I
decided to do this,

00:43:16.850 --> 00:43:27.530
is that basically I see that
it's a responsibility that I

00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:28.950
have to share.

00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:36.030
And I see having a freedom of
living here and the opportunity

00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:38.490
to speak here, I
think-- I consider

00:43:38.490 --> 00:43:40.870
this as one of my
responsibilities,

00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:42.490
to tell people.

00:43:42.490 --> 00:43:51.300
And while-- just because I had
a difficult past experience

00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:54.970
does not necessarily mean
that I have a license

00:43:54.970 --> 00:44:02.170
to ask you or pressure you
to make certain contributions

00:44:02.170 --> 00:44:02.956
for the cause.

00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:15.680
I think what I can help is
that, if you are motivated

00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:20.830
to involved, and if you are--
but if you're not uncertain

00:44:20.830 --> 00:44:24.050
whether your time and
resource is worth it, that I

00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:27.270
think I can help with.

00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:31.740
I can assure that
it is worth it.

00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:37.850
Worth it, in a sense, not
for directly for your life.

00:44:37.850 --> 00:44:39.480
The next morning
you wake up, you

00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:45.040
will still have difficult
times waking up, go out of bed

00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:49.940
and come to work, even if
you contribute to the cause.

00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:57.970
But whatever you
decided to help,

00:44:57.970 --> 00:45:03.370
I can say that someone else
life-- some other North Korean,

00:45:03.370 --> 00:45:08.830
another Joseph's life, can be
changed, where he or she could

00:45:08.830 --> 00:45:13.410
come-- go to South
Korea or come to America

00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:18.320
and be able to experience the
type of life that we have.

00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:20.500
And I think that I can answer.

00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:24.690
And yeah.

00:45:24.690 --> 00:45:29.860
So I think one way is
just really remember them.

00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:33.884
And that's where the
actions can be started.

00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:42.840
AUDIENCE: Joseph, thank
you very much for sharing

00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:45.540
your story with us.

00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:48.240
As you shared that, as
you moved to America,

00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:53.450
you kind of rethought
about yourself,

00:45:53.450 --> 00:45:56.410
about the values that you
have, the dreams that you have.

00:45:56.410 --> 00:45:59.820
Somehow you
mentioned part of it.

00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:01.630
Could you share
some of your dreams

00:46:01.630 --> 00:46:08.010
that you have as result
from these reflections?

00:46:08.010 --> 00:46:09.240
JOSEPH KIM: Yes.

00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:11.290
I think the problem
with me is that I'm

00:46:11.290 --> 00:46:13.500
interested in so many things.

00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:20.590
I find myself spending nights
on learning how to hack Wi-Fi.

00:46:20.590 --> 00:46:21.560
I don't know why.

00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:23.470
I thought it was
very interesting.

00:46:23.470 --> 00:46:28.190
Basically, I would just follow
what 17-year-old kids tell

00:46:28.190 --> 00:46:30.340
me what to do, [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:36.420
I find myself spending time,
for days and hours and hours.

00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:43.000
I also find politics and
philosophy very interesting.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:50.990
And I think-- I've been
taking philosophy classes.

00:46:50.990 --> 00:46:53.380
I really enjoyed it,
but it was very--

00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:56.600
it was also a lot of work.

00:46:56.600 --> 00:47:00.930
And I also took an
international relations class.

00:47:00.930 --> 00:47:03.640
And I think it was
also interesting,

00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:06.570
but also it was something
that I get it quickly.

00:47:06.570 --> 00:47:14.900
So my goal is to learn, focus
my time in where I can do well

00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:21.920
and where I can-- where I find
myself doing-- enjoy doing it.

00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:25.950
So my dream is one day--
and philosophy, on the side,

00:47:25.950 --> 00:47:30.840
I think I wanted to do it
[INAUDIBLE] on my [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:35.790
And with that knowledge,
I hope that, one day, when

00:47:35.790 --> 00:47:43.870
North Korea opens, I
hope to go back and teach

00:47:43.870 --> 00:47:51.670
the philosophies, hopefully,
or especially ethics,

00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:53.760
I'm most interested in.

00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:57.150
So those are my dreams.

00:47:57.150 --> 00:48:01.800
And for now-- recently
I heard someone

00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:05.930
saying that the reason why--
the purpose of studying

00:48:05.930 --> 00:48:10.280
is to find out what you
didn't know, or how much you

00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:12.630
didn't know.

00:48:12.630 --> 00:48:16.260
Now I think about it, it's
very obvious statement.

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:18.790
But I think it has also
very profound meaning.

00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:21.690
Because knowing what
you didn't know,

00:48:21.690 --> 00:48:24.510
or how much you didn't
know, is one way

00:48:24.510 --> 00:48:27.780
to find my identity and myself.

00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:34.586
And I believe that-- I greatly
enjoy studying, for now.

00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:41.180
So that would be my
dream, continues studying.

00:48:41.180 --> 00:48:46.630
And hopefully, one day,
I can go back and teach

00:48:46.630 --> 00:48:48.590
philosophy ethics, I hope.

00:48:48.590 --> 00:48:50.470
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:52.957
HANNAH SONG: I think this
will be the last question.

00:48:52.957 --> 00:48:54.665
AUDIENCE: Actually,
I have two questions.

00:48:54.665 --> 00:48:57.270
One, I think it's
more for Hannah.

00:48:57.270 --> 00:49:01.700
So I'm really curious about once
the North Koreans escape out

00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:06.080
of the country and either
they decide to stay in China

00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:07.580
or move to other countries.

00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:09.130
What is their status?

00:49:09.130 --> 00:49:12.722
Like nationality?

00:49:12.722 --> 00:49:14.680
I mean, nationality is
definitely North Korean.

00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:17.430
But what kind of
citizenship do they have?

00:49:17.430 --> 00:49:21.010
And I think South Korea has
a way to support citizenship

00:49:21.010 --> 00:49:21.760
for North Koreans.

00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:24.470
But do other countries
have other support?

00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:27.790
And second question is, I'm
also-- I'm actually from Korea.

00:49:27.790 --> 00:49:29.750
And I say, I'm Korean--
I'm from Korea.

00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:32.050
And everybody say,
South or North?

00:49:32.050 --> 00:49:35.930
So I can assume
that many people are

00:49:35.930 --> 00:49:37.480
going to be surprised
if you say--

00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:38.871
it's for Joseph,
sorry-- when you

00:49:38.871 --> 00:49:40.245
say you're from
North Korea, they

00:49:40.245 --> 00:49:41.453
will have a lot of questions.

00:49:41.453 --> 00:49:43.840
And they will have
like reaction to you.

00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:46.530
I wonder-- I'm curious to
know what kind of reaction

00:49:46.530 --> 00:49:50.546
you get when you tell people
that you're from North Korea.

00:49:50.546 --> 00:49:54.090
JOSEPH KIM: So I personally
have not been to South Korea,

00:49:54.090 --> 00:49:59.910
so I don't know what
the reaction would

00:49:59.910 --> 00:50:02.470
be if I was in South Korea.

00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:08.760
But I think in America, whenever
I meet South Korean friends

00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:15.010
or people from South
Korea, they are very open.

00:50:15.010 --> 00:50:21.410
They're very curious
about lot of things.

00:50:21.410 --> 00:50:23.980
But there is--
there was one time

00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:29.220
that I was in South Africa
for another conference.

00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:31.280
It was called [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:37.340
And basically, 192
countries send young leaders

00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:38.445
from each nations.

00:50:42.270 --> 00:50:45.270
And during the time we were
waiting for the opening

00:50:45.270 --> 00:50:48.810
ceremony, in front
of me, there was

00:50:48.810 --> 00:50:56.040
a delegate from South Korea--
one man and one women.

00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:57.570
They asked me,
where are you from?

00:50:57.570 --> 00:50:59.240
And I said, I'm
from North Korea.

00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:00.785
And they were like, no way.

00:51:00.785 --> 00:51:03.470
They're like, well,
how can you be here?

00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:07.810
And then we talked a
little bit, but then I

00:51:07.810 --> 00:51:11.270
think the conversation
just dropped,

00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:16.770
because we didn't really know
what to talk about afterward.

00:51:16.770 --> 00:51:23.510
But I think we started-- instead
of talking about politics,

00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:27.940
or talking complicated matters,
we started asking like, oh,

00:51:27.940 --> 00:51:30.300
how long did your
flight take you to here,

00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:31.990
or what was it like?

00:51:31.990 --> 00:51:36.380
And we started talking about
very basic conversations.

00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:45.550
And during the four days of our
conference, we became so close.

00:51:45.550 --> 00:51:50.230
We would share meals
and eat meals together.

00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:55.820
And I think that was the
closest experience that I have,

00:51:55.820 --> 00:52:01.980
or the reactionary that I--
so from South Korean people.

00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:09.120
And in terms of status, I'm
sorry, I kind of lost track.

00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:10.860
HANNAH SONG: I'll answer that.

00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:13.390
So the status, then, for
North Koreans in China

00:52:13.390 --> 00:52:14.865
is they're illegally there.

00:52:14.865 --> 00:52:16.490
So the Chinese
government, because they

00:52:16.490 --> 00:52:19.460
don't recognize them, refuses
to acknowledge them as refugees.

00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:21.910
But they are technically
under the UN definition

00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:25.550
of refugee surplus, meaning
they qualify as a refugee

00:52:25.550 --> 00:52:27.130
because of the
circumstances they

00:52:27.130 --> 00:52:29.720
would face once they've
left their country.

00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:31.810
Meaning because of the
risk they would be at

00:52:31.810 --> 00:52:33.810
if they were to be repatriated.

00:52:33.810 --> 00:52:36.390
And so they do qualify
under that definition.

00:52:36.390 --> 00:52:38.230
And so the
international community

00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:41.420
recognizes them as refugees
once they've left North Korea.

00:52:41.420 --> 00:52:43.300
The Chinese government does not.

00:52:43.300 --> 00:52:45.030
And so that's one
of the reasons why

00:52:45.030 --> 00:52:47.280
NGOs like ours have to
play this role in-between.

00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:49.488
Because governments are very
limited in terms of what

00:52:49.488 --> 00:52:52.656
they can actually do to help
North Korean refugees in China.

00:52:52.656 --> 00:52:55.125
As are agencies like
the UNHCR, in fact.

00:52:55.125 --> 00:52:56.750
You know, they're
very limited in terms

00:52:56.750 --> 00:52:58.830
of how they can actually
help North Koreans.

00:52:58.830 --> 00:53:00.320
And that's one of the main
reasons why we bring them out

00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:01.580
through to Southeast Asia.

00:53:01.580 --> 00:53:03.580
And in Southeast Asia,
there are countries there

00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:05.038
where they are
recognized, or where

00:53:05.038 --> 00:53:06.720
they do have an
opportunity, then,

00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:09.370
to apply for refugee
status or for resettlement

00:53:09.370 --> 00:53:11.890
in countries like South
Korea and the United States.

00:53:11.890 --> 00:53:14.120
South Korea will
essentially, you know,

00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:15.780
see them as South
Korean citizens.

00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:18.360
And so they do receive that
citizenship pretty quickly

00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:19.490
upon resettling.

00:53:19.490 --> 00:53:22.450
Coming to the US, for
example, or other countries,

00:53:22.450 --> 00:53:24.524
they come as refugees
and then have

00:53:24.524 --> 00:53:26.440
to undergo the process
of getting a green card

00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:29.560
and then can apply for
citizenship, as well.

00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:32.360
One quick point on kind of what
you had mentioned before, too.

00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:35.170
And being from South Korea,
you're probably also aware.

00:53:35.170 --> 00:53:37.550
But when North Koreans
go to South Korea,

00:53:37.550 --> 00:53:40.230
and people find out
they're from North Korea,

00:53:40.230 --> 00:53:42.070
you know, sometimes
it's not warmly

00:53:42.070 --> 00:53:43.770
received in South
Korean society.

00:53:43.770 --> 00:53:46.160
And it's one of the
biggest challenges

00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:47.910
that a lot of North
Koreans do face there,

00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:50.410
because of this type of
discrimination they can face.

00:53:50.410 --> 00:53:53.150
But I think a lot of it really
just comes from a challenge

00:53:53.150 --> 00:53:55.902
with the narrative in
South Korea on North Korea.

00:53:55.902 --> 00:53:57.860
And I think that's a real
opportunity, in terms

00:53:57.860 --> 00:54:00.930
of us trying to figure out a
new narrative, a new framework,

00:54:00.930 --> 00:54:05.320
to help young South Koreans
understand this issue, as well.

00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:06.920
And so one of the
really sad things

00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:08.810
is some of the North Koreans
we work with in South Korea

00:54:08.810 --> 00:54:10.710
actually, when they
ask where they're from,

00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:14.100
will lie and say that they're
from-- they're ethnically

00:54:14.100 --> 00:54:16.720
Chinese Korean,
[INAUDIBLE], or will

00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:18.940
say that they are just
from the South, that's

00:54:18.940 --> 00:54:21.230
why they have a strange accent.

00:54:21.230 --> 00:54:24.620
Because they want to hide the
fact, many times, that they're

00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:25.910
from the North.

00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:30.382
And so our hope is, with the
work we do in South Korea--

00:54:30.382 --> 00:54:32.340
and if there's any Googlers
in South Korea that

00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:34.610
want to be involved,
working on trying

00:54:34.610 --> 00:54:36.820
to change the narrative
around this issue,

00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:38.610
especially in South
Korea, it's going

00:54:38.610 --> 00:54:41.318
to be really vital
in the coming years.

00:54:41.318 --> 00:54:42.770
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:54:42.770 --> 00:54:45.620
HANNAH SONG: So I think
we've run out of time.

00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:48.580
The last thing I wanted to
just end on-- and I guess we

00:54:48.580 --> 00:54:49.500
don't have the slide.

00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:51.208
I don't know if it's
possible to find it,

00:54:51.208 --> 00:54:52.720
but we wanted to
just give people

00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:56.020
a chance to get involved
if you're interested.

00:54:56.020 --> 00:54:59.340
And Alyssa mentioned that
you guys will be starting

00:54:59.340 --> 00:55:01.050
a group here within Google.

00:55:01.050 --> 00:55:02.640
And if you're
interested, I encourage

00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:04.044
you to please check it out.

00:55:04.044 --> 00:55:05.460
There are opportunities
that we're

00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:09.580
hoping to work closely with
the group here within Google.

00:55:09.580 --> 00:55:12.400
One obvious way to get
involved is obviously to give.

00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:15.300
You can give your money,
which we will happily take.

00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:17.550
You can give your
travel credits, which

00:55:17.550 --> 00:55:19.470
we will also happily take.

00:55:19.470 --> 00:55:22.370
You can give your time, if you
want to be a part of this group

00:55:22.370 --> 00:55:23.630
volunteering.

00:55:23.630 --> 00:55:24.950
We need all sorts of help.

00:55:24.950 --> 00:55:26.410
And sometimes it's
even with just

00:55:26.410 --> 00:55:29.020
optimizing our own online
campaigns and things like that,

00:55:29.020 --> 00:55:29.930
as well.

00:55:29.930 --> 00:55:33.170
And so those are some easy
ways that you can get involved.

00:55:33.170 --> 00:55:35.480
If you have the means,
and are interested,

00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:38.802
you can actually donate
to rescue one refugee.

00:55:38.802 --> 00:55:40.830
And that information
is all on our website,

00:55:40.830 --> 00:55:42.890
and also on those boards
in the back there.

00:55:42.890 --> 00:55:45.220
And the last thing, obviously
you can just follow us,

00:55:45.220 --> 00:55:46.720
keep in touch with
what we're doing.

00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:49.430
And if something comes up
that you're interested in,

00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:53.290
please feel free to get
involved, reach out to us.

00:55:53.290 --> 00:55:56.490
We'd love to have you be a
part of what we're doing.

00:55:56.490 --> 00:55:59.100
So, you know, I wanted
to really, really thank

00:55:59.100 --> 00:56:02.000
Alyssa, and also Gloria, for
organizing such a great event.

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.500
Thank you guys all so much
for being here today with us.

00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:06.930
And especially a huge
thanks so much to Joseph

00:56:06.930 --> 00:56:09.750
for sharing his story with us.

00:56:09.750 --> 00:56:15.800
