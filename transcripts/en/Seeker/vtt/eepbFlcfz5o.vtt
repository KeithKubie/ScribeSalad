00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:08.380
A new crime scene technology aims to recreate
the suspect's face from a single hair.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:15.440
Anthony Carboni here for DNews, and new software
out of Pennsylvania State University might

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.660
be able to construct a mugshot of a suspect
from a single hair left at a crime scene.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.280
DNA evidence is already used in a lot of crime
scene investigations- it's currently most

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.869
useful in terms of matching whether someone
who is already a suspect to evidence at the

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.440
scene or in proving the innocence of someone
accused.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.859
It's basically a lock and key situation- if
you have a person and a result, you can plug

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:40.000
the DNA in to draw a line between them.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.960
It's not yet used in terms of trying to find
out what the suspect looks like- there are

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.530
about 20 to 25,000 different coding genes
in the human genome, and we're still not sure

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.820
what they all do, so getting a clear picture
of a suspect from DNA isn't entirely possible

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:55.820
yet.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.660
The experimental technique tries not to worry
about what we don't know and instead uses

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.170
a database of volunteers and their genes to
make software that can give investigators

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.440
an approximation of their suspect.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.800
The team grabbed facial images and DNA from
600 people of mixed ancestry living in the

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:12.800
US.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.950
They used software to compare 7000 different
points on their faces- two points on someone's

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.770
nose might be flatter- 20 might make their
cheekbones more pronounced.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.160
Then they took the genes of those people and
looked at about 20 genes that we know are

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.050
associated with facial shape and found common
genes that volunteers with similar features

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.050
shared.

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.300
Using that information, the team created software
that'll analyze a DNA sample and then construct

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.150
a possible suspect's face based on their genetic
similarities to the volunteers.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.861
It sounds awesome, though if I had to give
one criticism of the system right now, it

00:01:43.861 --> 00:01:49.220
would be that everyone comes out looking like
those nightmare baby masks from The Purge.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.090
Researchers admit that the technology isn't
quite there- there's not a single gene that

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.600
makes your nose big or small.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.710
It's easier to say whether someone is tall
or short, or figure out what their hair color

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.950
is, than it is to figure out something as
complex as facial shape.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.770
And even when we do map more genes and figure
out how to make software like this more accurate,

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.830
it'll still have the same issues as any DNA
evidence collected now- DNA samples can be

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.590
incomplete, contaminated, mixed.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.890
It's a great tool, but it needs to be backed
with other evidence.

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.569
Even still, this seems like a pretty crazy
first step towards something that'll probably

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.940
be a huge investigative tool in the future.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.680
If you have any feelings about DNA and crimes,
or about those baby masks from The Purge,

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.700
I've got a lot of feelings about those, you
can tweet at me.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.160
