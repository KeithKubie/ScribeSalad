all ideas are stupid and so the

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 align:start position:0%
right the first time is zero it's just
 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
right the first time is zero it's just
not<00:03:32.250><c> gonna</c><00:03:32.459><c> happen</c>

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 align:start position:0%

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 align:start position:0%

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:35.650 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't matter that it's imperfect
 

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:37.650 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't matter that it's imperfect

00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:37.660 align:start position:0%
imperfect it just matters that you do it

imperfect it just matters that you do it

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:39.460 align:start position:0%
and that you move forward so that's

and that you move forward so that's

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
really that's really positive news as
 

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:42.750 align:start position:0%
really that's really positive news as

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:42.760 align:start position:0%
far as I'm concerned because you can
 

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:44.610 align:start position:0%
far as I'm concerned because you can
actually<00:11:42.910><c> do</c><00:11:43.300><c> that</c><00:11:43.510><c> right</c><00:11:43.780><c> you</c><00:11:44.140><c> can</c><00:11:44.320><c> do</c><00:11:44.500><c> it</c>

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:44.620 align:start position:0%
actually do that right you can do it
 

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:46.830 align:start position:0%
actually do that right you can do it
badly<00:11:44.970><c> anyone</c><00:11:45.970><c> can</c><00:11:46.150><c> do</c><00:11:46.270><c> that</c><00:11:46.450><c> so</c><00:11:46.720><c> that's</c>

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:46.840 align:start position:0%
badly anyone can do that so that's
 

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:50.700 align:start position:0%
badly anyone can do that so that's
that's<00:11:47.620><c> useful</c><00:11:48.930><c> okay</c><00:11:49.930><c> so</c><00:11:49.990><c> like</c><00:11:50.290><c> if</c><00:11:50.440><c> you're</c><00:11:50.590><c> an</c>

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:50.710 align:start position:0%
that's useful okay so like if you're an
 

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:51.900 align:start position:0%
that's useful okay so like if you're an
