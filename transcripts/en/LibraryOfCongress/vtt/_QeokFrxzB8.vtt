00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From The Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.940 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon, I'm Taru Spiegel
from the Library's European Division

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.330
and welcome to this program about
Jean Sibelius and Fritz Kreisler.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.400
And many thanks to the Embassy
of Finland, Keijo Karjalainen

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.940
and the Library's Music
Division, Anne McClain,

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.480
David Plylar [phonetic]
and Jen Loritson [phonetic]

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.500
for making the event possible.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.070
Also the great technical staff

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.530
who makes us look professional,
thank goodness.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.530
We're happy to have Jani Lehtonen

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.980
and Jani Aarrevaara
as our speakers today.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.200
And, let me tell you, it was
very, very hard to get 2 speakers

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.360
with the same first name
[laughter], but we managed.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.080
And we also get extra points
because the names Jani and Jean,

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.710
as in Jean Sibelius are related.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.200
As you know, this year marks the
150th anniversary of the birth

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.220
of Jean Sibelius, whose
actual birthday was yesterday.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.370
And we're glad to remember this
great Finnish composer and also

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.550
to highlight one of the Library's
treasures, the original manuscript

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.220
of the Fritz Kreisler
piano arrangement

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.890
of Sibelius's lovely violin
concerto "Opus 47 D Minor".

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.250
And the treasure is right
there, being guarded by David.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.320
And why and when this Kreisler
reduction was made is a mystery

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.040
that today's speakers
will look into.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.800
Sibelius was born in
Finland in 1865 and Kreisler

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.270
in Austria, 10 years later.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.360
Both were extremely
famous in their lifetime

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.550
and are still well loved
by audiences worldwide.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.180
Today's talk will focus on
a lesser known conjunction

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.350
of these superstars.

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.980
I would like to mention that the
Library's holdings include more

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.980
than an thousand titles
relating to Sibelius.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.700
Also, unique here, is the
Fritz Kreisler collection

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.310
which includes manuscripts,
personal papers and correspondence.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.420
The music division serves
materials for your music inquiries

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.590
and the European Division
would be the place to go

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.040
to for various European
language materials including

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.170
Finnish material.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.700
Jani Lehtonen is first violinist
of the Helsinki City Orchestra,

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.430
Concertmaster of Joensuu City
Orchestra as well as lead violin

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.350
with the Philharmonic
Entertainment Strings and a member

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.950
in the prize-winning
Arcadia Quartet.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.110
He studied at the Sibelius Academy

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.210
and the Royal Danish
Academy of Music.

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.900
Lehtonen's been a soloist with the
Helsinki City Orchestra as well

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.630
as the Aalborg and Odense
Symphony Orchestras among others.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.390 position:56%
In 2007, he received a special award

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.860
at the XI Concorso Violino
Citta di Brescia Competition.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.110
His sound recordings include Haydn,
Kuchler, Segestrom and Kreisler.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.980
Jani Aarrevaara teaches
piano on the faculty

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.810
of the Tampere Music Conservatory.

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.230
He graduated from [inaudible]
Music Academy

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.460
and received his concert diplome

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.920
under the direction of
Erik Apel [phonetic].

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.750
He has taught piano
at various Finnish

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.390
and German music institutions.

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.680
One of Aarrevaara's awards
led to a concert tour

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.070
that included Carnegie Hall--
a Carnegie Hall performance

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.700
and his repertoire consists
of chamber music and lead.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.050 position:56%
And together the Janis published a
Kreisler CD in 2012, they're working

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.590
on another one that's
looking for a publisher

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.310
that features this
Kreisler reduction.

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.480
And they've done a lot of
research on this material.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.190
We hope to see it published
maybe one day.

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.610
Finally, for the fun bit,

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.810
please note that the
event is being videotaped

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.610
and please turn your
cell phones off.

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:53.100
So, I'll have a little talk
here with Jani Lehtonen.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:58.150
So, Janie, what led you here to
talk about Kreisler and Sibelius?

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.480
&gt;&gt; When Jani Aarrevaara and I
made our first joint recording

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.050
of Fritz Kreisler's work
for violin and piano,

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.970
I learned a lot about
Kreisler's life.

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:16.170
Our CD published in 2012 contains
a number of known, and less known,

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.810
compositions created by
this master violinist

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.010
and composer during
his remarkable career.

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.410
When writing the booklet for the
CD, [inaudible] excellent biography

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:35.190
of Fritz Kreisler, "Love's Joy,
Love's Sorrow" was a great help.

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:41.850
It is possibly the most
comprehensive work in this area.

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.220
Biancolli's book ends
with a complete listing

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.570
of Kreisler's work made
during his lifetime.

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.290
Looking at this, my
interest was sparked

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:58.650
by the Sibelius violin concerto
Opus 47 D Minor arrangement

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.440
for piano and violin.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.330
&gt;&gt; So you had mentioned that
this was a big surprise,

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.540
this information about manuscript?

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:10.120
&gt;&gt; Yes. The information about
the Sibelius arrangement was

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.360
so interesting for a Finnish
violinist that I began

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.190
to investigate where I could
find the music material.

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.590
The Biancolli's list
of works stated only

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:24.190
that this was an unpublished
work held here

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.480
at the U.S. Library of Congress.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:31.750
I spoke about the matter with some
well-informed people in Finland,

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:37.400
and it turned out that the Finnish
National Radio Library had a copy

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.310
of the Library of Congress
manuscript

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.780
which is over there on the table.

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.520
I received a top duplicate copy

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.690
from them [inaudible]
library [inaudible].

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:55.640
At this stage, I still
didn't know what to expect

00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:00.130
because Kreisler had made a number
of published and, thus well-known,

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:04.740
arrangement of violin concertos
by different composers as well

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:12.020
as other works whose structure
he had completely changed.

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.190
One can therefore rather
speak about these

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:18.630
as new compositions using
someone else's technique.

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:22.710
This, however, was not the
case regarding the Sibelius

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:24.380
violin concerto.

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:28.890
Kreisler had kept the solo violin
part unchanged, in other words,

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:32.310
just as Sibelius had composed it,

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:37.100
except for some very
minor violinist details

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.710
which may be considered
editorial suggestions rather

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:43.270
than actual changes.

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:48.990
&gt;&gt; So when you found the manuscript
copy, what was your next step?

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:51.930
What did you decide to do?

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:58.550
&gt;&gt; We decided to actually
record the whole thing.

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:06.440 position:56%
It was so good that it would be nice

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:11.100
for other people really
hear that music.

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:21.680
And, actually, the background music
when you came in this hall was

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:29.110
from the CD made by us last year.

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:35.220
And we are now waiting for
a publisher for this CD.

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:44.310
&gt;&gt; So you did a considerable
amount of research

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:47.380
on the Kreisler reduction.

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:51.350
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Despite our
efforts, we have been unable

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:54.940
to find any written references
about the Kreisler piano reduction

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:58.770
of the Sibelius violin
concert, so all the conclusions

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:01.570
about this version are our own.

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:04.910
Why Fritz Kreisler made
his own piano reduction

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:08.980
of the Sibelius concerto
remains a great mystery so far,

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:12.520
especially since Sibelius
also made his own reduction

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:16.020
of the piece in 1905.

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:21.180
Also the date of the
Kreisler reduction is unknown.

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:27.180 position:56%
Future research may clarify if Jean
Sibelius had time to work the violin

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:31.360
and orchestra concerto into
his 1905 arrangement for piano

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.660
and violin before Kreisler
made his own version.

00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:39.090
Did Fritz Kreisler and
Jean Sibelius ever meet?

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:42.320
Both are historic superstars
in their day

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:45.540 position:56%
and were only 10 years apart in age.

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:51.600
As far as we know, Kreisler
visited Finland twice and, thus,

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.380
a meeting would have been possible.

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:57.360
Did Sibelius know about
Kreisler's piano reduction

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.190
and did Kreisler have the
composer's permission?

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:02.030
We don't know.

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:06.040
From the point of view of research
into the recent history of music,

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:10.900
it would be most enlightening to
find answers to these questions.

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:12.510 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Okay, I have just a little aside.

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:16.490
I was reading a little bit about
Kreisler and I'm not sure if he got

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:20.780
to Finland this time, but
he was playing in Russia

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:24.480
and met a Finnish girl and wanted
to leave everything behind.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.600
This was when he was
young and foolish, right?

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:28.900
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:30.700
&gt;&gt; But he was persuaded
to go back [laughter].

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:33.750
So, anyway, what do you
think was the reason

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:35.820
for the Kreisler reduction?

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:42.410 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Generally speaking, the events
that revolutionized musical culture,

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:47.810
radio and records, also radically
changed music consumption habits.

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:52.440
Before this breakthrough, it was
only possible to enjoy live music.

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:55.720
This meant that mostly only
the upper classes were able

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.890
to pursue music at the high level.

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:03.980
It has also largely affected
how music was published.

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:09.530
For instance, Felix Mendelssohn
Bartholdy secured a contract

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:13.980
from his publisher for the famous
E Minor Concerto for Violin

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:17.030
and Orchestra only on condition

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:20.110
that he also prepare a
piano reduction based

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:24.530
on the orchestration
as soon as possible.

00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:28.090
In other words, classical
music in its own time was first

00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:30.950
and foremost consumer music.

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:36.890
It was performed not just at actual
concerts, but at home in silence

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:42.430 position:56%
and for festive occasions often with
a reduced configuration not least

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:46.540
because of the various
more number of orchestras.

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:47.960
&gt;&gt; So about a hundred years ago,

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:52.940
you and Jani Aarrevaara would have
been playing this piece at home

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:56.590
for your friends and family
or at some local event?

00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:57.890
&gt;&gt; Correct.

00:10:57.890 --> 00:10:59.190
&gt;&gt; Yeah?

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:03.220
&gt;&gt; In times past, recital concerts
were far more common than today.

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:09.140 position:56%
The artist would either play or sing
most often to piano accompaniment.

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:12.940
This seems strange to us
today because we are used

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:15.700
to hearing live performances
for solo instruments

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:20.140
or orchestras only as
a part of a concert.

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:24.540
Even until the Second World War,
it was usual for violin recitals

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:29.010
to feature a violin concerto with
piano accompaniment in addition

00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:32.860
to music similarly
configured for the program.

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:38.000
During Fritz Kreisler's career,
this was not at all uncommon.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.680 position:56%
The fact that he created a reduction

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:45.070
for the Sibelius violin
concerto definitively indicates

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:49.770
that the work made a
significant impression on him

00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:53.880
because a reduction requires
a lot of work and time.

00:11:53.880 --> 00:12:01.400
And I can show you, it is
really a huge amount of work.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:04.570
These are our copies of
the original manuscript

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:09.950
which you can look at on the table.

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:16.250
It's 39 pages handwrited music.

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:27.290
It's really great job he has
done so I would say it takes

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:34.180
at least weeks just to
write this whole thing.

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:45.230
But he also made this great work of
arranging the whole concerto again

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:50.950
from the big orchestral
score for piano score.

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:55.210
&gt;&gt; So was the Sibelius
concerto well-known

00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:59.430
when Sibelius composed
it in 1904, right?

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:02.430
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I would say yes and no

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:09.240
because the first time it
was performed in Helsinki,

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:16.410
the first version, it wasn't
very successful thing.

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:24.210 position:56%
And, afterwards, Sibelius made huge
corrections for his violin concerto.

00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:29.820
And this is a revised
version we nowadays know

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:32.570
and hear soloists playing.

00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:35.640
And this Kreisler's
work is also based

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:39.070
on this revised Sibelius
violin concerto.

00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:48.090
And but it wasn't very famous
before Jascha Heifetz recorded it.

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:54.490
But, afterwards, it has been maybe
the most successful violin concerto

00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:56.070
ever composed.

00:13:56.070 --> 00:14:03.450
And nowadays, the amount of
recordings is over 60 recordings

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:07.880
of Sibelius violin
concerto so it means

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:12.590
that it is most recorded
violin concerto ever composed

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:15.240
on 20th century.

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:19.490
&gt;&gt; So, Jascha Heifetz made
this known in the '30s, right?

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:20.790
&gt;&gt; Yes, I think so.

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:22.090
It was in the '30s.

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:23.560
&gt;&gt; So, it wasn't really
such a super, super,

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:27.030
super hit when Kreisler
did the reduction, so.

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:28.900
&gt;&gt; No, no, that's right.

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:33.010
&gt;&gt; So, any conclusions about
the Kreisler reduction?

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:44.650
&gt;&gt; I would say that,
like I said before,

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:52.570
he was a really great
affected about Sibelius music.

00:14:52.570 --> 00:15:02.630
And we have to remember that
he was extremely gifted person

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:06.890
as a violinist, but
also as a composer.

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:14.080
When he got the place from Vienna
Conservatory at 7 years old,

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:19.840
his first teacher was
Anton Bruckner really.

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:25.370
And composing was also
main part on his studies.

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:33.850
And he was remarkably talented
to produce music by heart

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:38.100
and also arrange other
composers' works

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:40.700
for his own instrument especially.

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:43.820 position:56%
But he was also really good pianist.

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:47.240
So that's why this reduction

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:52.960
for Sibelius concerto
is really interesting.

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:59.920
And I would say it's a real
treasure for violinists, pianists

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:04.460
and also music lovers
all over the world.

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:06.960
&gt;&gt; So the quality is good,
you said, yeah, yeah.

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:09.240
&gt;&gt; Yes, it's, it's brilliant.

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:10.540
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:14.400 position:56%
&gt;&gt; So, as was mentioned before,
Sibelius also created an arrangement

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:19.270
of this concerto so what
are the differences?

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:24.330
&gt;&gt; I think we could ask
this from other Jani now,

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:27.600
he has some kind of show so.

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:28.960
&gt;&gt; Should I start with the show?

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:30.260
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.560
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:46.270
&gt;&gt; So, hello.

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:53.100
Yes, in the following, I
will present some notes

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:57.040
on Kreisler's reduction
in comparison

00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:01.570
with Sibelius's own reduction.

00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:09.940
I will also play some samples
from our CD and some samples

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:18.030
with the orchestra,
a couple of samples.

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:24.880
Apparently, there are at least 3
reductions of Sibelius's concerto,

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:30.410
Sibelius's own reduction
from 1905 like we just heard

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:37.060
from the same time when he finished
his second version, last version,

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:43.650
of the concerto, a reduction
by Alexandre Gretchaninoff,

00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:51.130
a Russian composer from 1942 which,
according to Sibelius's secretary,

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:56.930
Santeri Levas, was
something Sibelius also liked.

00:17:56.930 --> 00:18:05.240
You can read one sentence of this,
of this reduction in the biography

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:09.000 position:56%
by Santeri Levas, and the third one,

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.640
the unpublished Fritz
Kreisler's reduction.

00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:20.430 position:56%
Compared to Sibelius, Kreisler uses
the low bass register most sparingly

00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:22.790
throughout line.

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:25.950
This is partly explained by
the fact that Sibelius wanted

00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:31.620
to create an impression
whereas Kreisler did not.

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:34.400
What is this impression?

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:38.360
This concerto is often
considered as--

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:44.350
or its orchestration is
considered dark, that's true,

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:48.810
ballads of fagatos, clarinets,
violoncelle, double basses,

00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:53.810
timpani that Sibelius uses
and the violins, for example,

00:18:53.810 --> 00:19:02.770
are playing quite low, not
very often high positions.

00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:08.660
In the first-- no I think this
was the second critic in the U.S.,

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:12.260
the work was played first in
New York and the second one was

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:17.850
in Chicago in 1907, I think
in New York one year earlier.

00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:22.230
The critic in "Chicago
Daily Tribune" wrote,

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:27.890
"this masterpiece is orchestrated
in strange and dark colors".

00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:34.150 position:56%
So this is something Sibelius wants
to emphasize and, on the other hand,

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:39.520
Kreisler does not want, perhaps.

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:43.280
Maybe in his mind, there
is a brighter sound

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:47.310
that he wants from the piano.

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:49.220
To some extent, Kreisler leaves

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:53.640
out this dark mainly
counteractive basses also contrary

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:55.180
to the orchestral score.

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:59.490
But these are just
rare, rare examples.

00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:11.070
Here from the first movement,
it's very clear to be seen,

00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:13.510
Sibelius version deep
basses, counteractive basses,

00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:15.480
they don't actually exist.

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:19.820
Fagatos, double basses and
kettle drum play this one,

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:24.050 position:56%
what we see in Kreisler's reduction.

00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:28.300
Let's hear an example by, this is
Frank Patecioman [phonetic] right?

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:30.280
&gt;&gt; Yes, Helsinki [inaudible].

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:36.510
&gt;&gt; First example, just a moment.

00:20:36.510 --> 00:21:05.060
[ Music ]

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:07.510
And then, from our CD.

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:35.350
[ Music ]

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:38.860
So, what did you think?

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:42.210
What do you think?

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:45.060
How do you find it?

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:47.110
&gt;&gt; I pick yours.

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:52.420
&gt;&gt; At least we-- so in this
Kreisler version, it was,

00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:55.920
there was same basses actually
like in the original version.

00:21:55.920 --> 00:22:02.090
Some other examples from the third
movement, same thing, Sibelius,

00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:07.300
deep basses, they do not
exist in the orchestral score.

00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:13.240
And Kreisler uses the same basses
like in the orchestral score.

00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:16.780
Another note, in his reduction,

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:19.920
Kreisler has a thinner texture
throughout the line which,

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:25.750
in some cases, demonstrates
a more pianistic approach.

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:33.850
Here maybe the best example of the
whole concerto also from the point

00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:40.720
of the pianistic approach,
Kreisler uses--

00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:53.770
here Kreisler uses tremolo instead
of chord triplets by Sibelius.

00:22:53.770 --> 00:23:02.300
These kind of chords are not very
rewarding to play for a pianist.

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:07.430
And, I think, Kreisler found
here very elegant solution.

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:10.360
Let's hear how it sounds.

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:22.180
Think I have a technical problem.

00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:32.640
Escape, yeah, yeah.

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.940
Sir?

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:41.850
&gt;&gt; Try moving up the [inaudible].

00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:44.510
&gt;&gt; Okay. Oh.

00:23:44.510 --> 00:24:18.310
[ Music ]

00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:23.420
Another example from the
second movement, it's very easy

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:26.290
to see the very thick texture

00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:30.980
in Sibelius's version,
Kreisler, light texture.

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:37.380
Or, from the third movement,
again, quite unpianistic writing

00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:42.620
in Sibelius's version, Kreisler
makes it easier for a pianist and,

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:48.440
perhaps, this is also not
necessary for the sound image.

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:54.480
But we see, or hear,
in Sibelius's version.

00:24:54.480 --> 00:25:02.750
There are also opposite examples
of thicker or thinner texture.

00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:07.800
Kreisler, here, uses
chords, at the same time,

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:11.870
Sibelius just uses octaves

00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:15.850
so a thicker texture in
Kreisler's reduction.

00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:22.580 position:56%
And also here, at the end of the
third movement, I think this gives--

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:29.670
this is the end of the whole
work, of course, this gives weight

00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:39.870
for the last pass of the work to my
mind, maybe, gives more weight to--

00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:43.520
it gives more, it emphasizes
the end better

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:47.180
than the octaves in
Sibelius's version.

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:52.370
Kreisler has some individual
simplifications compared

00:25:52.370 --> 00:26:00.600
to the score in rhythms, harmonies,
or in leaving out the melodic line.

00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:07.470
The first sample, for example,
from the first movement,

00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:14.010
this is the original
one with the 16th note,

00:26:14.010 --> 00:26:17.850
in Kreisler's version,
he leaves that away.

00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:21.510
It sounds like this.

00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:41.850
[ Music ]

00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:45.410
So here we were already at the end.

00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:49.700
Or in the first movement, there are
some simplified harmonies Kreisler

00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:51.770
just leaves some harmonies away,

00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:55.150
but these are very rare
examples in the whole work.

00:26:55.150 --> 00:27:01.980
And the first movement, I don't
know if you can see something here,

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:06.660
it's very small, but there
are some slides on the paper.

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:10.760
I hope you get to this room.

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:21.500
Up here, there is a line, melodic
line played by oboes, clarinets,

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:29.010
fagatos, French horns, later
here by trombones and trumpets.

00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:31.960
Kreisler just leaves it away.

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:34.350
Couple of these kind
of examples also

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:38.460 position:56%
in this reduction by Fritz Kreisler.

00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:40.930
And, again, on the other
hand, there are places

00:27:40.930 --> 00:27:47.490
where Sibelius does not follow
the score and Kreisler follows.

00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:51.760
In this example, the
melody should be on the beat

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:56.780
and it is the case in
Kreisler's reduction.

00:27:56.780 --> 00:28:02.430
Sibelius, he, for some reason,
considered it otherwise.

00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:07.990
In his reduction, Kreisler
has several appropriations

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:09.990
in the orchestra accompaniment

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:13.760
which actually are the
most significant changes

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:16.550
to Sibelius's chord.

00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:21.860
Of course, if you leave
something away like in this,

00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:28.130
maybe the most radical example,
it does perhaps some harm

00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:32.120
for general form for the
architecture of the work.

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:36.180
But, on the other hand, and on the
whole, Kreisler's appropriations

00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:39.700
to the orchestral score
seem very natural

00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:44.240
and also are elegant solutions.

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:51.590
Here we wrote the bass Kreisler
leaves away, for example here,

00:28:51.590 --> 00:29:01.240
10 bars, 2 bars here, this
part consists of 76 bars.

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:04.730
And here we just see 39 of them.

00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:10.640
So, there are 9 places,
shortened by 37 bars all together.

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.510
Let's hear how it sounds.

00:29:12.510 --> 00:30:01.620
[ Music ]

00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:04.300
And so on.

00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:09.850
Kreisler has some of his own
additions and simplifications

00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:17.870
which support the sound image,
such as in the first movement,

00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:24.780
he puts up, or moves up, the
melody played actually by fagatos

00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:29.440
and violoncelle down here.

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:32.910
One octave higher like this.

00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:38.020
This is perhaps one
indication more to the fact

00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:43.410
that Kreisler had a brighter
sound in mind than Sibelius.

00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:53.550
Or here, the rare example, Kreisler
just put some chords to the end

00:30:53.550 --> 00:30:59.520
of the whole work, maybe to give
some [inaudible] for the end.

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:07.830
Or the third movement
beginning here,

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:12.830
the kettle drums are playing
this written [clapping].

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:17.940
And the strings are
playing [clapping].

00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:19.240
And last one-- .

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:24.820
&gt;&gt; -- If we are doing it together,

00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:27.630
it should sound like
this, I'm strings.

00:31:27.630 --> 00:31:31.240
&gt;&gt; You're on strings,
okay [clapping].

00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:35.720
And so on.

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:41.580
&gt;&gt; So it should sound all the
time [clapping] but it's not

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:45.150
when you are listening
to orchestral version,

00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:54.080 position:56%
the strings are more powerful so the
image you get from, at the audience,

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:58.820
it is bum ba ba, bum ba ba,
bum ba ba, rather than da, da,

00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:03.160
da, da, da, da, da, da, da.

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:08.530
&gt;&gt; So, here, Kreisler
chooses the solution

00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:14.220
that actually support
the sound image.

00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:18.450
The example is now played by Jani.

00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:20.470
This is?

00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:23.840
&gt;&gt; This is [inaudible] symphony.

00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:25.640
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:44.710
[ Music ]

00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:50.230 position:56%
As you can hear, even the timpani's
playing the rhythm, da, da, dun, da,

00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:53.530 position:56%
da, dun, da da dun, but what we hear

00:32:53.530 --> 00:32:57.110
from the orchestra are
mostly the strings,

00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:59.840
bum ba ba, bum ba ba, bum ba ba.

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:04.510
This is how it sounds
in Kreisler's reduction.

00:33:04.510 --> 00:33:22.940
[ Music ]

00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:27.250
So, come to the end.

00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:31.250
Generally speaking, one can
emphasize the pragmatism

00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:36.760
and pianistic approach
of Kreisler's reduction.

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:42.610
For example, Sibelius's reduction
has simply far more notes

00:33:42.610 --> 00:33:47.320
in the chords, but that is
perhaps not always necessary

00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:50.250
to create an impression.

00:33:50.250 --> 00:33:53.120
Kreisler's appropriations
have been executed

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:56.430
with good taste and,
thus, sound natural.

00:33:56.430 --> 00:34:04.700
And I would like to add to this
that leaving out the deep basses

00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:10.330
or moving up the melodic line
here and there indicate that,

00:34:10.330 --> 00:34:13.600
in his reduction, Kreisler
doesn't always want

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:16.870
to imitate the dark
sounds of the orchestra.

00:34:16.870 --> 00:34:21.790
His intention seems to let the
piano sound a little bit brighter

00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:24.450
than it does in Sibelius's
reduction.

00:34:24.450 --> 00:34:26.510
Thank you.

00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:35.890
[ Applause ]

00:34:35.890 --> 00:34:45.960
&gt;&gt; Are there any questions
from the audience?

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:48.260
Questions?

00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:52.690
Yeah, you have one?

00:34:52.690 --> 00:34:58.400
&gt;&gt; So, one question that comes
up in my mind is the, in general,

00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:01.420
it seems like a much more practical
solution that Kreisler is doing.

00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:04.280
Do you know from, I know
that the date is not known

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:07.600
of this particular
transcription, but do you know

00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:14.620
if it was his practice to perform a
concerto with a pianist in general,

00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:18.940
in addition to his
orchestral performances?

00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:21.260
So, is this something that he would
do and he just needed something

00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:26.450
that was a more utilitarian
type of, for his personal use

00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:27.970
of these types of reductions?

00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:31.290
I don't know enough about
his performance habits

00:35:31.290 --> 00:35:33.840
in the early days.

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:36.270
&gt;&gt; That's a good question.

00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:41.940
As far as I know, Kreisler
played a lot

00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:46.000 position:56%
of concerts with different pianists.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:54.130
And, for example, he recorded
all Beethoven's 1 sonatas

00:35:54.130 --> 00:35:58.690
at least 3 times which
is quite a huge work.

00:35:58.690 --> 00:36:05.640
So, recital concerts was
his main business actually.

00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:11.080
And, but we don't know anything
about this work he made,

00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:14.660
this reduction from
Sibelius's concerto.

00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:20.130
We don't know did he play
it himself, but I guess,

00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:29.600
I suppose that he was planning
to use this work in his recitals.

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:33.750
But, unfortunately, there's no
written documents about this.

00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:36.310
&gt;&gt; But did he generally
have a pianist

00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:38.420
when he was doing these recitals?

00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:40.140
&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, of course.

00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:44.860
&gt;&gt; But I meant more when he's doing
concerto reductions in performance,

00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:47.070
was that part of his
staple repertory?

00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:49.300
So not just the works that
are for violin and piano,

00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:55.290
but also these types of reductions.

00:36:56.490 --> 00:37:02.530
&gt;&gt; Well, I don't know, but during
his time, it was really common

00:37:02.530 --> 00:37:04.540
to play every kind of music.

00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:06.240
&gt;&gt; Everybody did this at the time.

00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:07.540
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:09.240
&gt;&gt; So I assume Kreisler did it too.

00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:11.130
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:17.490
Still Jascha Heifetz
played lots of recitals

00:37:17.490 --> 00:37:20.950
and playing concertos
as the first half.

00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:27.470
For example, this Mendelssohn
Bartholdy E Minor Concerto was very

00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:30.920
often played by him with piano.

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:33.890
And then, after intermission,
there was show pieces

00:37:33.890 --> 00:37:37.290
and then some sonatas
and something like that.

00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:41.180
&gt;&gt; Even if, yes, even if
he was already a superstar

00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:42.610
who played with every orchestra.

00:37:42.610 --> 00:37:44.910
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:37:47.530 --> 00:37:52.430
&gt;&gt; So, can I ask, what, you are
very, very interested in Kreisler.

00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:58.820
What, in particular, got
you so fascinated by him?

00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:08.160
&gt;&gt; Of course his works for
violin are very fascinating

00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:11.650
for a violinist like me.

00:38:11.650 --> 00:38:17.240
Or every other violinist should
be interested about his works.

00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:21.580
Maybe that's the main
reason we became

00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:24.650
so interested about his works.

00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:30.700
And, of course, this recording
we have recorded some, was it 11

00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:34.380
or 12 Kreislers showpieces
we played together?

00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:35.680
&gt;&gt; Eleven.

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:36.980
&gt;&gt; Eleven, yeah.

00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:43.420
And it was quite a big work to
produce these works as a CD and,

00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:48.190
of course, we played those
works so much that we find

00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:53.070
out all the time more
details from the score.

00:38:53.070 --> 00:38:57.400
And so it was really
interesting job to do.

00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:01.900
&gt;&gt; And from the pianist's
point of view, it's rewarding

00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:09.120
to play Kreisler's score because
it's very pianistic always.

00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:19.010 position:56%
He was a good pianist too and you
can, you see it, you feel it always.

00:39:19.010 --> 00:39:22.120
&gt;&gt; There's a question.

00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:28.460
&gt;&gt; Are these 2 reductions played,
are they performed a lot today?

00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:29.760
&gt;&gt; You mean?

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:31.250
&gt;&gt; Sibelius and Kreisler.

00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:34.960
&gt;&gt; Kreisler not because
this is unpublished.

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:44.170
So we are using only copies
and it's not available

00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:46.420
from music store or somewhere.

00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:52.960
So, you have to come here to
U.S. Library to get copies so.

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:54.360
&gt;&gt; The Sibelius one?

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:57.650
&gt;&gt; Sibelius one, it's
available everywhere.

00:39:57.650 --> 00:39:59.930
And also this Gretchaninoff
version of it-- .

00:39:59.930 --> 00:40:01.230
&gt;&gt; -- Gretchaninoff too.

00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:02.530
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:04.630
&gt;&gt; Mostly you play
the Sibelius version.

00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:11.770
Of course, nowadays, reductions
are mostly played in concerts just

00:40:11.770 --> 00:40:15.610
in choral works, from
the choral works.

00:40:15.610 --> 00:40:19.900
Not so often anymore in this
kind of instrumental concertos.

00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:25.030
&gt;&gt; Yeah, in fact, your
performance last night

00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:29.230
at the Finnish Embassy
was probably the premiere

00:40:29.230 --> 00:40:32.360
of this Kreisler reduction.

00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:41.100
&gt;&gt; Yes, it could be true that it
might be the first time ever here

00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:45.170
in the U.S. And, of course, we have
played these together somewhere

00:40:45.170 --> 00:40:49.960
in Finland and, day
before yesterday,

00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:54.480
we played it in Copenhagen when
it was Finnish National Day.

00:40:54.480 --> 00:41:02.690
So that was actually the
first really public concert

00:41:02.690 --> 00:41:07.240
of this version we gave.

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:09.110
&gt;&gt; Any other questions?

00:41:09.110 --> 00:41:15.010
All right, well, we
have some music then

00:41:15.010 --> 00:41:17.590
to round up this program, right?

00:41:17.590 --> 00:41:18.890
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:41:18.890 --> 00:41:22.510
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, Mike Turpin [phonetic]
back there has been handling

00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:25.380
the technology.

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:30.340
&gt;&gt; So this is the third
movement of Sibelius's concerto

00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:37.380
with Kreisler piano reduction
from the CD we made last year

00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:40.710
and we are still looking
for a publisher for this CD.

00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:44.860
