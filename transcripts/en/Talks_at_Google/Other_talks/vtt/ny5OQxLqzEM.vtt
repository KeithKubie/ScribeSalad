00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:02.380
DAN LADERMANN: Thank you.

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:03.526
CHERIE SORIA: Thanks,
Elizabeth.

00:00:03.526 --> 00:00:04.840
DAN LADERMANN: Thank you.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.870
We look forward to
having you back.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:07.540
CHERIE SORIA: We do.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.500
And we're so fortunate, because
everywhere we go all

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.190
over the world we are able to
meet up with former students

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.270
of our again, and hear their
stories about their

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:18.450
transformational experience.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.300
And when I was talking to
Elizabeth a few minutes ago, I

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.200
was telling her that one of
the things that's really

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.520
interesting to us is that our
graduates, when they see us--

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.620
it could be 10 years later,
12 years later--

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.520
they remember the foods that
they made, the teachers that

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.160
they had, the students
that were in the

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.520
classroom with them.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.240
And they say that it's
just something that

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.260
they'll never forget.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.350
And so, it's so great to be able
to see you again and hear

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.100
your stories.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.250
And we're really happy
to be here at Google.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.120
We're going to make this really
brief, because I know

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.190
that we only have you
until one o'clock.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.320
So we're going to try and cut to
the-- two o'clock, I mean--

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.720
we're going to cut to
the chase here.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.940
I'll tell you, just briefly,
the reason that I

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.260
got into raw food.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.060
Dan will tell you
his brief story.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.960
And then we'd like to talk about
what our research has

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.680
told us are the best
foods to eat.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.750
We want to make this really
simple and really fun.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.960
If it's not simple and fun,
you're not going to do it.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.390
So we're really going to make
it as simple as possible.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.290
What foods to eat, what
foods not to eat.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.870
And also, what foods we
eat on a daily basis.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.360
Because we're really
busy people.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.860
We own four businesses.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.550
We have 40 employees.

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:26.930
We've written a lot of books.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.820
We travel all over the world.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.320
And we need to keep
our energy up.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.890
And a lot of people think as
you get older, your brain

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.750
function starts to diminish
a little bit.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.240
And for many people, it
does, because it all

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.420
catches up with you.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.220
So we need to make sure that
our brains are working

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.760
top-notch all the time.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.960
And so I think it would be
helpful for you, probably, to

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.080
know what we eat.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.140
And actually, I don't think
that we need to wait.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.190
We can just pass these around
right now, because I don't

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.070
think they're going to get
better by sitting for

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.020
another half hour.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.340
What do you think?

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.040
Help yourself.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.040
There's going to be plenty.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.930
If somebody wants to pass them
around, or just pass them.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.860
You can have as many
as you want.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.610
This is a small group.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.500
I know you already had lunch,
but you have this recipe on

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.640
your chair there.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.740
And in the interest of time,
I'll go through the recipe

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.000
really briefly, but I don't see
any need for you to sit

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.510
and watch a blender stirring.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.660
I think it's more important for
us to talk about how we

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.930
build those kinds of flavors
and how to incorporate that

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.490
kind of food into your life.

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.310
So my name is Cherie Soria, and
I'm the founder of Living

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.570
Light Culinary Institute.

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.070
I started the school
15 years ago.

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.080
I've been teaching vegetarian
culinary arts for 40 years.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.830
I'm going to be 66.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.070
And so I've had a lot of
experience with vegetarian

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:47.760
cuisine in my life.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.430
20 years ago, I changed to a raw
food diet, and that took

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.640
me to the next level of being
energetic and vibrant and has

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.760
really slow down aging, because
I have seen other

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.880
people in my family who have
continued aging at an

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.530
accelerated rate, compared
to myself.

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.360
So I know for sure that I'm
getting the nutrients that I

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.450
need, and it's foremost
in my mind.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.660
But I originally changed to a
vegetarian diet because of

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.600
really horrible health
conditions in my family.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.150
Most people in my family, even
young people, were getting

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.700
cancer and heart disease.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.440
My grandmother died of
heart disease when

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.740
she was in her 30's.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.920
My grandfather died of cancer
when he was in his 50's.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.460
My sister died when
she was 10.

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.600
My mother died when
she was 24.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.390
And so it was very frightening
to me.

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.120
And I was very sickly
all the time.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.350
And I didn't want these things
to happen to me.

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.890
So I started studying about
health at a really young age.

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.450
And I was a natural.

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:49.890
I was a foodie.

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.200
I liked great food.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.540
And so I started studying from
different kinds of chefs.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.490
But then I put my own healthy
spin on it, once I moved away

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.790
from home and my parents weren't
telling me that I had

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.850
to eat meat or I would die.

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.670
And in those days, people
did think that.

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.070
So anyway, long story short, I
got healthier and healthier,

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.130
and I kept reading more and
more about health, and I

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:15.910
started teaching others
about it.

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:24.240
And then when I was about 45 or
so, I started to study more

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.220
about raw foods.

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.330
And then I opened Living
Light Culinary

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.360
Institute 15 years ago.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.410
My husband, Dan, and I have
written four books.

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.230
And we just have a brand
new book out.

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.000
And we'll talk about that
in a little while, too.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.950
So I want to tell you that
I'm a really busy person.

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.540
I get up about 5 o'clock every
morning, and I put in a good

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.980
12 to 16 hours a day.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.810
We're pretty much on 24/7,
because we have 40 employees

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.140
and they all have questions, and
we're hands-on managers.

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.970
But what we eat is really
important, and we want to

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.354
share that with you today.

00:04:59.354 --> 00:04:59.762
DAN LADERMANN: And my

00:04:59.762 --> 00:05:01.440
background is totally different.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.190
I'm a recovering internet
technology guy

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.050
from Silicon Valley.

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.940
I started out--

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.650
CHERIE SORIA: Some of you
can relate to that.

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.670
DAN LADERMANN: I started out
with an electrical engineering

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.910
degree and then got a Master's
in Computer Science and worked

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:17.600
for the government with both
Unix and communications, even

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.280
before it was called TCP/IP
protocols, before the

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.460
internet grew up.

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.640
And then I moved to California
in the late '70s, and was

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.860
involved in a number of start-up
companies in the

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.820
internet, and pioneered both
Unix and internet when it was

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.870
a handful of computers
on the internet.

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.810
And now it's just amazing and
makes room for places like

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.930
Google to do amazing work.

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.450
And so I lived here
in Silicon Valley.

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:48.280
I worked within four different
locations over time, within a

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.720
two-mile radius of here.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.320
So this is like returning home,
on San Antonio Road.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.540
And so it's really great.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:58.230
But I was living the really
good life, the fast life.

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:01.900
I had the red sports car and
all the fun things, and ate

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.700
too much and drank too much, and
had about 35 extra pounds

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.610
of weight that I didn't need,
and had back problems and

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:11.690
allergies and all sorts
of things happening.

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:15.970
And then in about '95, I learned
about raw foods.

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:20.030
And so I started a transition
to going from--

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:21.460
and I grew up in Ohio.

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:22.640
I was meat and potatoes.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.900
So I went from meat and potatoes
to mostly raw, and

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:30.070
then to vegan, and really
saw amazing results.

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:34.220
And then in '98, I want to
Hippocrates in West Palm Beach

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.430
and took a health educator
program.

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:40.060
And what I found after seeing
all the healing that happened

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:44.890
on a vegan raw diet is, I
decided that I wanted to do

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:48.850
education about health and
vitality versus go back into

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:49.450
technology.

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:52.540
So I came back, started a
nonprofit called the Institute

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:53.780
for Vibrant Living.

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:56.880
We started one of the-- before
meet-up groups existed, before

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:00.410
Google Hangouts existed, we had
a raw food community that

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:01.760
had to use list servers.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.130
But we had about 1,000 people on
our list, and really one of

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:07.970
the more active raw food
communities right here in

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:08.960
Silicon Valley.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.120
CHERIE SORIA: One
of the first.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.060
DAN LADERMANN: One of the
first, and the biggest.

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:14.400
And we ended up putting
on events.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.360
We had, at one point, almost--

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:20.300
we had 800 people in San
Francisco in '99 at a big raw

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:21.070
food conference.

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:23.440
So really pioneered a lot
of things from the

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.240
internet into raw foods.

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.520
And so it's been really great.

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.400
I eventually hooked up with
Cherie, and brought what I had

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:33.310
been doing with events and
education and my background in

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:35.240
with what Cherie had
with the school.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.830
And that's really allowed us to
really grow Living Light.

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:41.590
And it's been so great to have
people come to our school,

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:43.010
people like Elizabeth.

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:46.330
And it just feeds us when we can
see the impact we have by

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:49.210
teaching one person, to have
them be able to come something

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:52.660
like Google and the campus and
have a restaurant serving raw

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:55.240
foods to the Google staff.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:59.741
So that'll keep us going for
another couple more days.

00:07:59.741 --> 00:08:02.665
It's that type of thing that
really, really feeds us.

00:08:02.665 --> 00:08:05.100
CHERIE SORIA: And students come
from over 55 countries to

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:10.750
our school, because the raw
food revolution is really

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:12.250
hitting everyone in the world.

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:15.900
Anyone who has embraced the
Western way of life is

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:18.610
experiencing a health
crisis, just like

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:19.850
we are in this country.

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:23.460
And so that's why raw food has
become so popular, and why the

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:27.530
publisher Wiley Publishing asked
us to write this book,

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:30.630
"Raw Food for Dummies."

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:32.870
DAN LADERMANN: So it's been
really good for me.

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:35.500
I've really found, with
raw foods, much

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.370
more energy and clarity.

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:40.190
I'm getting younger
every year.

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:43.490
Next month is my 60th birthday,
and just getting

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:49.020
more vibrant and healthier every
day, more energy in the

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:52.920
afternoons, a lot more
productivity in my life.

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.240
And so it's great
teaching that.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:57.390
So what we want to share today
is some of that, that we put

00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:00.930
into our books, in particular
in "Raw Food for Dummies,"

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:02.660
about how to make it
really simple.

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:06.300
Because a lot of people are
interested in raw food, they

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:09.790
like the benefits of raw food,
but don't necessarily know how

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:13.810
to go about it or think it's too
much work, or don't have

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:16.760
the right balance that makes
it really doable.

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:20.200
So we like to think of
it as a lifestyle.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.250
It's a change in the
way you live.

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:24.820
And once you get into
it, it becomes very

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:26.560
easy and very rewarding.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.710
CHERIE SORIA: And it needs to
be fun and delicious, and it

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:29.570
needs to be simple.

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:31.150
Otherwise, you're not going
to do it, right?

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:33.640
Dan and I are busy
all the time.

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.430
I love to be in the kitchen.

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:37.500
I could be in the kitchen and
play all day long, but I don't

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.040
have the time.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:42.520
So I need to be able to make
food that tastes really great,

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:45.820
because I am a foodie and I
like big, bold flavors.

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:48.490
If you notice that about the
hummus that you just had.

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:51.110
My flavors are big and
bold and lively, and

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:53.430
that's just like me.

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:56.320
Not big, maybe, but definitely
bold and lively.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:00.740
So what we want to talk about
now is what we've learned, a

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:03.470
little bit of what we've
learned, about what to eat to

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:06.600
have the most nutrient
dense kind of diet

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.470
that's really easy.

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:11.560
We're not going to talk about
expensive super foods that

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:14.090
have to be brought over here
from Brazil or Thailand or

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:15.220
anything like that.

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:17.640
Really, you can buy foods
in the supermarket--

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.470
well, we like to buy organic
foods, and we

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:21.400
do recommend those--

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:25.030
but foods that are pretty simple
to get ingredients in

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:26.040
most places.

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:29.270
So we're going to talk
about the colors.

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:29.930
DAN LADERMANN: The colors.

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:32.700
And the first thing to start
out with is you want fresh,

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:35.100
ripe, raw produce.

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:35.360
CHERIE SORIA: Organic.

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:37.030
DAN LADERMANN: And organic,
because that's going to give

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:39.770
you the maximum nutrition
in the produce.

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:43.310
And the reason we like to have
it raw is as soon as we cook

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:46.720
and process food, we start
killing off the nutrients that

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:49.910
make it so valuable, the
antioxidants, which are

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:54.080
phytochemicals, things that
fight off free radicals, which

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.750
are always running around
in our body

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:57.530
trying to destroy ourselves.

00:10:57.530 --> 00:11:00.180
And when we add the antioxidants
that we get in

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:03.450
our produce, it's just one of
the phytonutrients that helps

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:06.000
balance that and helps
keep us healthy.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.630
CHERIE SORIA: And
phytonutrients, the word phyto

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:08.960
is Greek for plant.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.860
You can't get phytonutrients
from anything

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:12.390
other than plant foods.

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:14.960
And so, if you're eating a diet
that is really low in

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.560
plant foods, you're not getting
enough protection,

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.730
because you're not getting
those phytonutrients.

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:22.070
DAN LADERMANN: And the easy way
to think about raw foods

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:25.100
is if you eat a color of the
rainbow, the spectrum of the

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:27.810
rainbow-- different plants with
different colors have

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:29.040
different phytonutrients.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:32.820
So if you eat everything from
the dark blues to the oranges

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:37.050
to the yellows to the greens and
reds, you're going to get

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:39.952
a full spectrum of these
different phytonutrients.

00:11:39.952 --> 00:11:42.840
And the nice thing about a raw
food diet is it's not about

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:43.750
counting calories.

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:46.180
It's not about worrying did
I get enough protein.

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:48.800
If you're eating enough
calories, if you're sustaining

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.380
your lifestyle, you're going to
have a naturally balanced

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:53.640
weight, you're going to have
natural energy, you're going

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:56.340
to get all the protein, all
the calcium, basically

00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:59.410
everything you need, with the
exception of B-12 and Vitamin

00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:00.670
D, if you're not
out in the sun.

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:01.770
Those are the two things--

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:03.730
CHERIE SORIA: And probably a lot
of you are going to need

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:07.580
some Vitamin D, right, because
you spend a lot of time at

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:07.910
your computer.

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:08.530
I know we do.

00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:09.690
DAN LADERMANN: The light
from computer monitors

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:10.760
just doesn't do it.

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:11.740
CHERIE SORIA: It
doesn't count.

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:12.550
DAN LADERMANN: That
doesn't do it.

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:16.865
So Vitamin D supplements and
B-12 are really important.

00:12:16.865 --> 00:12:19.990
CHERIE SORIA: And B-12, because
we're eating primarily

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:23.820
a plant-based diet, but also
because the soil has become so

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:26.880
depleted that a lot of organisms
can't even live in

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:27.890
the soil anymore.

00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:32.020
And that's where B-12 comes
from, from the life cycle of

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:33.860
these organisms that
live in the soil.

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:36.280
So those are only two
supplements that we really

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:38.020
take on a regular basis.

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:42.870
We just make sure that our foods
that we choose to eat

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:43.820
are nutrient dense.

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:47.490
DAN LADERMANN: So if we start
out with dark blues and

00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:49.230
purples, things like
blueberries.

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:51.530
Blueberries are a perfect
super food.

00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:53.040
And they don't have to
be imported from

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.070
all around the world.

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:55.540
They're really healthy.

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:57.570
We'll try to get them
fresh, if we can.

00:12:57.570 --> 00:12:59.390
If we can't, frozen is good.

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:01.090
They're picked really
ripe and frozen.

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:03.520
You lose a little bit of
nutrients, but you have them

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:07.520
there to be able to
use in your food.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:11.930
All sorts of different types
of berries, plums, black

00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:15.340
mission figs, things that
are deep, dark colors.

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:17.310
So those are really
going to be good,

00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:18.760
have their own spectrum.

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:21.640
And in the "Raw Food for
Dummies," we have a table that

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:24.220
shows what different
phytonutrients and what they

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:25.960
do in different plants.

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.320
But you really don't need to
worry about which ones they

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:30.380
are, just get a spectrum.

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:35.360
So that if you want to get
things like your carotenoids

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:38.850
and things, you get that from
your oranges and yellows,

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:45.570
oranges, yellow bell peppers,
carrots, peaches, mangoes.

00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:46.410
CHERIE SORIA: Apricots.

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:48.890
DAN LADERMANN: Whether it's a
fruit or a vegetable, they

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:50.630
have that color, and
that tends to have

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:51.500
a particular spectrum.

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:53.510
And there's a lot of overlap,
because there's a lot of these

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:54.580
different phytonutrients.

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:59.030
But it's the synergistic effect
of having them all and

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:01.590
the way they work together,
which is also a key.

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:02.570
CHERIE SORIA: And then
there's red.

00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:06.650
And red, of course, tomatoes,
red bell peppers, watermelon.

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:08.250
And so they contain lycopene.

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:09.890
You might have read
about lycopene.

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:12.640
And maybe if you read about
lycopene, you might have read

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:16.220
a big controversy that you don't
get enough lycopene from

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:17.950
tomatoes unless you cook them.

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:18.490
Not true.

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:20.800
All you have to do is break
down the cell walls by

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:21.640
processing them.

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:25.150
So when we make a tomato sauce
in the blender and it's raw,

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:27.270
or we put it in the food
processor, we're making a

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:32.420
marinara, or we're dehydrating
a tomato and then making it

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:34.950
into a powder-- and you can
buy the powder, as well--

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:38.120
those cell walls are broken and
you're getting really good

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:42.510
quality, bioactive lycopene.

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:45.350
DAN LADERMANN: And the core
foundation of a raw food diet

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:47.450
is our favorite color,
which is green.

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:50.310
We love all the recycling and
the bins you've got here,

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:53.070
because being green for the
environment, all the green

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:56.630
cars, electric cars outside,
it's really nice.

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:59.400
Unfortunately, we drove down
in our RV, but we do have

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:00.210
solar on it.

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:03.690
So we generate some of our
own solar power when

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:05.010
we're doing a big trip.

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:08.160
But our other car's a Prius, so
we try to balance them out

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:12.260
and dive the Prius 99% of
the time and the RV

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:13.720
the rest of the time.

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:17.390
But green for the environment,
green in your foods.

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:22.900
Dark, leafy greens, kale,
spinach, those vegetables have

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:26.250
more protein, pound for
pound, than steak.

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:27.640
So they're really rich.

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:29.700
And they're rich in calcium.

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:32.310
They're rich in a lot of
the minerals we need.

00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:35.010
CHERIE SORIA: And even omega-3
fatty acids, which you need

00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:36.070
for your brain.

00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:36.860
Really important.

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:37.800
Brain and nerves.

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:38.850
DAN LADERMANN: Brain
and nerves.

00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:41.610
So green really rounds
out the spectrum.

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:44.400
And omega-3's, as Cherie said,
are very important.

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:45.840
And we get those from
our greens.

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:49.420
We get them from chia seeds,
hemp seeds, a little bit from

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:53.900
walnuts, but they still have a
balance of omega-6's, which is

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:56.800
the fat that we get whenever
we have processed foods.

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:59.940
Whenever you have processed
foods and processed oils,

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:02.510
you're going to get omega-6's,
and omega-6's cause

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:06.960
inflammation, omega-3's bring
down inflammation and also

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:11.310
build the things you need around
your nervous system and

00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:13.430
your spinal cord to make
your nerves and your

00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:15.070
body really work well.

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:18.500
So it's really important to get
lots of omega 3's and cut

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:20.160
down on omega-6's.

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.820
CHERIE SORIA: The balance of
omega-3's is somewhere around

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:27.780
two to three, so a ratio of two
to one, with omega-3's and

00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:32.200
omega-6's, just because we
do get so many omega-6's.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.690
Omega-6 isn't a bad thing.

00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:35.250
It is an essential fatty acid.

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:36.010
You need to have some.

00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:38.220
It's just that we get way too
much, because of all the snack

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:39.160
foods that we eat.

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.910
And a lot of people, even with
raw food, are eating a lot of

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:45.050
seeds, and there are omega-6's
in seeds, other than, as you

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:49.650
said, hemp and chia and flax.

00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:52.570
So that's why raw fooders like
their flax crackers and they

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:56.790
like their chia, because it's
giving us that brain power.

00:16:56.790 --> 00:17:00.970
And really, omega-3's are
important also to support a

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:03.610
lot of other nutrients, just
like Vitamin C is a really

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:05.369
important support vitamin.

00:17:05.369 --> 00:17:08.390
Without Vitamin C in your
body, you're not

00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:10.140
really going to--

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:12.680
a lot of your other nutrients
are really not going to work.

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:15.329
You're not going to build as
much collagen as you need to.

00:17:15.329 --> 00:17:17.859
And collagen is important for
your eyes, your skin, your

00:17:17.859 --> 00:17:20.190
connective tissue, your
bones, everything.

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:22.230
And so without enough
Vitamin C, you start

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:23.710
to become kind of--

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:25.839
not only does your immune system
drop, but you also

00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:28.590
become more weak in many ways.

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:31.690
And I'm not talking so much
about strength, but in terms

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:35.170
of the quality of your tissue
and everything.

00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:40.410
So foods that contain Vitamin
C, all the citrus, all the

00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:42.510
berries, kiwi fruit.

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:45.990
But even broccoli and a lot of
the greens do contain Vitamin

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:50.160
C. So if you're eating a diet
that's really high in greens,

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.460
you're getting a lot of other
nutrients, as Dan says,

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:55.890
minerals and even Vitamin C. As
well as, people ask us all

00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:59.460
the time, on a raw vegan diet,
where do you get your protein?

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:02.520
We get it from the same place
that the majority of the

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:05.570
strongest animals on the planet
get their protein and

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:07.940
calcium, from greens.

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:10.470
So if you look at the majority
of the strongest animals on

00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:12.910
the planet, they're not the
carnivores, actually.

00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:14.450
They're the grazers.

00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:19.200
They eat the leaves and
they eat the grasses.

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.070
And they're plant eaters.

00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:25.310
And really we can learn from
that and benefit from a diet

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:26.970
that is dark green, also.

00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:28.840
Not the only color we need.

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:30.835
We do need other colors,
as Dan said.

00:18:30.835 --> 00:18:32.750
DAN LADERMANN: And the other
thing we can learn from them

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:35.050
is the things not to eat.

00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:37.650
The more you eat of raw
foods, the better.

00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:40.990
But it's also a function of when
you eat raw foods, what

00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:43.420
you're replacing that people
might be eating or you might

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:45.200
have had on a standard diet.

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:50.240
And as things that are cooked,
devoid of nutrients, where the

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:53.880
phytonutrients, the enzymes
have been killed off.

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:55.835
The minerals tend to stay,
because they're not

00:18:55.835 --> 00:18:56.800
heat-sensitive.

00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:59.810
But everything else that's in
our food, when we heat it or

00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:02.970
process it at high temperatures,
goes away.

00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:04.530
CHERIE SORIA: That's definitely
true of the

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:07.290
phytonutrients and the
antioxidants like Vitamin C.

00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:09.200
They're very heat and
light sensitive.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:10.730
DAN LADERMANN: And depending
on how we cook it.

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:13.755
If we're cooking starches and
potatoes at a high temperature

00:19:13.755 --> 00:19:16.690
or in bad oil, we're also
adding carcinogenic

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:17.490
substances.

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:20.980
If we're not eating organic,
we're adding GMO's, which no

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:25.760
one knows yet what the long-term
effect of GMO's are.

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:28.900
So these are all things that
as we add more fresh fruits

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:31.750
and vegetables to our diet,
we're displacing these other

00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:36.190
cooked foods that have
detrimental effects.

00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:40.170
They also have a high calorie
density, which means when you

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:43.910
cook them and you pack them
down, that burger or different

00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:47.840
foods really have so many
calories in a small amount,

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:49.300
it's easy to overeat.

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:51.330
And that's one of the
things causing--

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:55.510
that and a lot of sugar in food
is why people are gaining

00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:58.620
weight and having diabetes
is rampage.

00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:01.760
Everything else in the standard
American diet, in the

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:03.520
normal population--

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:05.760
and one of the nice things about
raw food is, and people

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:06.310
interested in it, and

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:07.940
congratulations to all of you--

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:10.970
you're willing to step
out of being normal.

00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:14.000
Because no one should
want to be normal.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.280
Normal people are
dying too early.

00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:19.340
Children are getting diseases as
infants that didn't used to

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:23.380
happen until people were at
least adults or in older age.

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:27.620
And the normal is
just not good.

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:31.050
CHERIE SORIA: And we have
such an issue with

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:31.830
health right now.

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:35.360
And so many people try to
get the magic bullet.

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:37.360
They go to the doctor, and the
doctor tells them they need to

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:38.050
take this pill.

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:40.000
And if any of you have ever
watched TV, if you can get

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.760
away from your computers long
enough, and you watched any

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:45.790
television commercials, you'll
see that all of these

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:53.960
pharmaceuticals come with very,
very major side effects.

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:57.320
I mean, some of them will tell
you if you have thoughts of

00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:01.890
suicide, or if you have
a heart attack,

00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:03.290
don't take this drug.

00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:04.920
DAN LADERMANN: It may just
cause sudden death.

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:07.880
CHERIE SORIA: It could cause
sudden death, seriously.

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:09.940
Those are the side effects
of some of these.

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:14.540
And going into the hospital is
a very scary proposition,

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:17.460
because hospitals are one of the
most dangerous places on

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:22.550
earth, more dangerous really
than going out on the freeway.

00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:25.090
They have done a study recently
that said that one

00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:28.820
out of seven people who are
treated in hospitals are

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:31.510
harmed or killed as a result
of their treatment.

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:32.490
One in seven.

00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:34.980
That's like Russian roulette.

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:36.120
How many of you are
going to do that?

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:37.810
But you go into the hospital.

00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:41.060
Even worse than that, I saw an
article in AARP magazine that

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:44.510
said the number of people who
are killed in one year in a

00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:48.880
hospital as a direct result of
hospital error is equal to 4

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:52.130
jumbo jets crashing
every week.

00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:54.780
Can you imagine what would
happen to the airline industry

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:57.140
if four jumbo jets crashed
every week?

00:21:57.140 --> 00:21:58.985
I wouldn't get on a plane.

00:21:58.985 --> 00:22:03.190
But people go to the hospital,
rather than making changes in

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:03.960
their diet.

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:06.590
And it doesn't have to be hard,
and they don't have to

00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:08.500
give up the flavors
that they love.

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:10.250
That's what we're here for.

00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:13.360
Our goal is to make healthy
living delicious.

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:15.740
Believe me, if it's not
delicious, I'm not going to

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:18.270
eat it, because I want food
that tastes great.

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:21.270
And if it's not easy, I'm not
going to spend all my time

00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:24.020
making it, not because I don't
like to, but because I don't

00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:25.360
have that kind of time.

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:28.250
So we want to share with you
some of the ways that we get

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:30.730
around that on a daily basis.

00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:33.720
DAN LADERMANN: And one of the
keys to making food go from

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:38.170
just raw food, and what both
of us experienced when, 20

00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:41.940
years ago, 17 years ago, we
got into raw foods, it was

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:43.660
pretty plain and boring.

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:46.590
And people basically wouldn't
stick with it, which is why we

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:49.930
both got into educating people,
and Cherie got into

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:53.640
learning how to make basically
gourmet food, which is taking

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:54.750
it to the next level.

00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:57.790
And that's by balancing flavors
the correct way, so

00:22:57.790 --> 00:23:00.910
that when you make a soup or
make a smoothie or a salad

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:02.850
dressing, it's got the
right balance.

00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:04.910
So it's just right on.

00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:07.850
And we teach people in our
school how to do that.

00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:10.520
And that's part of something
like that Elizabeth got.

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:13.390
Even in the first week of
training that she was there,

00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:16.800
we teach classes in flavor
balancing and dynamics, so you

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:19.100
understand as well, it needs
a little more brightness.

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:20.550
Or, it's too spicy.

00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:21.450
What am I going to
do with that?

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:22.870
The garlic's too strong.

00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:24.070
It's too bitter.

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:26.610
How do you bring that
to a maximum level?

00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:29.220
So when we talk about the things
we eat which seem very

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:32.760
simple, one of the keys, though,
is everything has

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:35.990
really great balance, has great
flavors, have depth of

00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:39.540
flavors and has a variety
of textures that make it

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:41.250
extremely pleasing.

00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:43.880
And those things aren't hard to
come by, they just take a

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:45.300
little more knowledge.

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:47.520
CHERIE SORIA: And I could talk
a little bit about what those

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:51.870
flavors are, just to give you
a little thumbnail of things

00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:53.620
to think about when you're
putting foods together.

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:56.540
Because really, if you
understand those flavors, you

00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:58.560
can open up your refrigerator
and you don't have to worry

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:00.420
about having a recipe,
having all the

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:01.870
ingredients in a recipe.

00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:03.790
But opening up your refrigerator
and say, oh, I

00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:05.670
have some of that, and I have
some of that, and I have some

00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:07.320
of that, and these are the
flavors, and I can make

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:08.810
something great out of those.

00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:12.830
And that's the kind of education
that we like to

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:17.470
impart on people, so that they
really have a freedom of not

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:19.850
having to follow recipes,
but are able to make

00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:21.040
great tasting foods.

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:23.360
But let's go ahead and just
tell people what we eat.

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:27.420
And as you've said, it sounds
really simple, but we have

00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:30.950
texture, we have flavor, we
have contrasts of texture,

00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:33.530
creamy and crispy
and all of that.

00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:37.120
And we have contrasting flavors
and big bold flavors,

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:38.500
and also, beautiful food.

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:39.700
It's got to be beautiful.

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:43.200
And we want to definitely
preserve the

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.480
colors of the food.

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:47.360
Sure, you can put all kinds of
different colors together and

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:50.320
you're still getting the health
benefits of it, but

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:53.870
visually, it's got to look
beautiful to be appealing and

00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:54.900
to want to eat it.

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:57.150
So appearance is really
important, too.

00:24:57.150 --> 00:24:59.220
So flavor, texture and
appearance, those are things

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:01.650
that we care about.

00:25:01.650 --> 00:25:03.370
DAN LADERMANN: So when we start
our day, the first way

00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:06.210
we start our day, other than
some water to make sure we're

00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:08.730
well hydrated, because hydration
is a really key.

00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:11.520
And that's one of the benefits
of a raw food diet, is you're

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:13.985
eating things that are full
of moisture and water.

00:25:13.985 --> 00:25:15.260
CHERIE SORIA: Thank you
for reminding me.

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:15.720
DAN LADERMANN: Yes.

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:18.870
So our first thing we have in
the day is a green smoothie.

00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:21.840
So a green smoothie is-- the
balance comes from-- normally,

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:24.260
we start out with some oranges,
some citrus, some

00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:28.270
bananas, other fruits from the
colors of the rainbow.

00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:29.530
We like our blueberries.

00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:33.230
We'll try to add strawberries,
and maybe mangoes or peaches.

00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:37.450
So you can see, we're building
that dynamics of the color of

00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:40.300
balancing that's going to get us
our phytonutrients and some

00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:44.170
water, and then lots of
greens, leafy greens.

00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:46.170
Our favorite normally is kale.

00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:48.440
But if we don't have kale,
sometimes we'll have romaine

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:51.230
or spinach, or whatever
is in the garden.

00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:53.260
And if it's bitter, then we just
have to have something

00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:56.000
that's a little sweeter,
maybe another banana,

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.980
to keep that balance.

00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:00.860
And then, once we blend that up,
we like to have a little

00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:03.150
bit of extra insurance,
which is in some

00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:05.220
of our green powders.

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:09.610
We love Vitamineral Greens,
which is a green powder that's

00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:13.210
done by Health Force
Nutritionals, and Renew Me,

00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:17.110
which comes from Vision
Industries, the makers of E35,

00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:18.550
another product that we like.

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:20.550
But these are plant-based
foods.

00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:24.390
So we like that extra balance
that we can get from that.

00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:26.920
Because as Cherie said,
we're very busy.

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:29.370
We had a very active life,
and those things are

00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:30.200
important to us.

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:30.430
CHERIE SORIA: Yeah.

00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:32.740
And our morning is kind
of our time to

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:34.100
get our green insurance.

00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:36.900
If we get plenty of greens in
the morning, then if we have

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:38.730
other foods throughout the
day, even if we make some

00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:41.860
choices, some good, healthy
cooked food choices, we know

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:44.580
we've had our raw leafy
greens in the morning.

00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:48.400
So having some of these super
food green powders, like Renew

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:51.830
Me and Vitamineral Green, in our
smoothie just boosts the

00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:54.990
greens even more, because it's
spirulina and chlorela and

00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:57.490
blue green algae and wheat grass
powder, and all these

00:26:57.490 --> 00:27:00.170
really wonderful greens.

00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:02.520
And also, we put chia seed.

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:04.820
We really like this one
product called Mila.

00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:08.960
But any kind of ground chia,
so you're getting even more

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:10.680
omega-3 fatty acids.

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:18.010
And sometimes, we'll put another
omega-3 rich product

00:27:18.010 --> 00:27:20.290
in, called Friendly Fats.

00:27:20.290 --> 00:27:23.770
And Friendly Fats is just a
combination of flax and chia

00:27:23.770 --> 00:27:33.330
and hemp, and other kinds of
high omega-3 ground seeds.

00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:34.500
DAN LADERMANN: And what
we don't put in.

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:35.740
We don't put heavy oils.

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:37.070
We don't put avocado.

00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:38.450
We don't put coconut oil.

00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:42.080
We don't put cacao, that some
people think, oh, these are

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:43.600
things that should
go in smoothies.

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:46.390
Well, our belief is, no, they're
not things that go in

00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:46.990
our smoothies.

00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:53.010
It's trying to get us off to
a good start for our day.

00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:54.180
CHERIE SORIA: Because we
want to stay light.

00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:57.360
If you put fats in with sugars,
for one thing, that

00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:59.620
can cause problems, because
fats take a long time to

00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:02.130
digest and sugars take very
little time to digest.

00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:04.450
So that can create problems
of their own.

00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:06.490
And I want to be really
energetic in the morning.

00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:08.390
I don't want anything that's
going to bring me down.

00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:11.060
I just had a good five or
six hours sleep, and

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:11.840
I'm ready to go.

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:16.170
And anything with fat in it at
that hour is just going to

00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:18.090
drop my energy level.

00:28:18.090 --> 00:28:20.570
DAN LADERMANN: And then
a green juice.

00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:21.690
We love greens.

00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:24.310
It's another way to get
concentrated greens in.

00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:27.250
Because we can have a pile of
greens that we wouldn't be

00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:30.430
able to eat as a salad, whereas
we juice them, we just

00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:31.870
get more and more greens.

00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:32.900
We've had our smoothie.

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:35.520
We've had our chia seeds.

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:37.300
So we've had our roughage.

00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:38.740
We've had our carbohydrates.

00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:42.490
And now we can get the greens,
which just boosts that.

00:28:42.490 --> 00:28:45.910
So green drinks or
green smoothies.

00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:48.090
Not smoothies, but complement
our green

00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:49.260
smoothie that we have.

00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:50.120
CHERIE SORIA: And usually,
that will be a

00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:51.080
couple hours later.

00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:53.800
Because we start out pretty
early in the morning, and so

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:57.800
it's a long time before lunch,
because we usually have lunch

00:28:57.800 --> 00:28:58.690
around one.

00:28:58.690 --> 00:29:01.680
So it's a long time between five
and one, and so the green

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:04.760
juice kind of fills in that
time and gives us another

00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:05.690
boost of energy.

00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:07.840
It's so much better
than coffee.

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:09.990
DAN LADERMANN: And one of things
we like to have along

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:11.900
with our smoothie, or first
thing in the morning, is

00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:13.250
something called E3Live.

00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:15.670
It's a frozen blue-green
algae.

00:29:15.670 --> 00:29:19.040
It's harvested frozen fresh,
and then we get

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:20.150
them shipped in.

00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:22.520
And it's something we've been
sharing with our students at

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:26.390
our school for 15 years now,
since you started the school.

00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:27.640
CHERIE SORIA: And all
of our staff.

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:28.635
DAN LADERMANN: And our
staff get it, too.

00:29:28.635 --> 00:29:30.170
So we really love that.

00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:32.040
It's very fresh and vibrant.

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:35.640
And we don't always get to
the school to have--

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:38.340
if we're working at the school,
where we have wheat

00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:40.190
grass and grow wheat
grass, we'll have a

00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:41.200
shot of wheat grass.

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:41.980
CHERIE SORIA: Also.

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:42.765
DAN LADERMANN: Also.

00:29:42.765 --> 00:29:44.820
So green, green, green.

00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:46.910
And if that's not enough green,
when it comes for

00:29:46.910 --> 00:29:48.270
lunch, guess what we have?

00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:50.631
CHERIE SORIA: Big fat salad.

00:29:50.631 --> 00:29:52.420
DAN LADERMANN: But lots
of times, it'll

00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:54.100
have a lot of goodies.

00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:56.940
We'll put sauerkraut on it,
which is a fermented food, so

00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:58.150
it's rich in probiotics.

00:29:58.150 --> 00:30:00.260
CHERIE SORIA: And probiotics are
really important because,

00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:02.790
they really help you to
digest your food well.

00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:09.080
And if you have an imbalance
of coliform bacterias, it

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:10.710
really helps to keep
all that in check.

00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:13.100
So you've got to have plenty
of probiotics.

00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:15.310
And fermented foods are a really
good way to do that.

00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:17.300
DAN LADERMANN: If you've ever
had antibiotics, antibiotics

00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:18.510
kill off bacteria.

00:30:18.510 --> 00:30:19.880
That's what they're
supposed to do.

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:22.450
Along with killing off bad
bacteria, it kills off all the

00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:24.130
good bacteria that
our body needs.

00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:26.050
CHERIE SORIA: And so does tap
water that's chlorinated.

00:30:26.050 --> 00:30:28.350
That kills friendly
flora, too.

00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:29.840
So that's why it's
so important to

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:32.560
have filtered water.

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:33.460
DAN LADERMANN: So salads.

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:37.210
And once again, we'll have
carrots and beets and maybe

00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:40.860
some lightly steamed broccoli,
maybe on our salad, which is

00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:42.970
basically a broccoli, just
pour hot water over it,

00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:44.120
softens it up a little bit.

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:46.425
So it's a little bit cooked,
a little bit raw.

00:30:46.425 --> 00:30:47.970
CHERIE SORIA: And this is
the time that we have

00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:49.310
more fat in our diet.

00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:52.980
We'll have avocado, maybe some
nice seasoned seeds, like

00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:54.070
Elizabeth was saying.

00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:55.880
We actually dehydrate
our seeds.

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:58.430
We season them and dehydrate
them, instead of roasting

00:30:58.430 --> 00:31:04.390
them, because roasting them
causes carcinogens and kills

00:31:04.390 --> 00:31:05.420
off some of the nutrients.

00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:07.085
So we use a dehydrator.

00:31:07.085 --> 00:31:09.450
I opened up that cupboard back
there, and there's an

00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:11.170
Excalibur dehydrator, and that's
our favorite kind of

00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:12.030
dehydrator.

00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:14.070
I don't know where it came from,
but it made me want to

00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:16.110
make kale chips.

00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:17.320
DAN LADERMANN: --which
we might have.

00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:21.150
We might have a cracker, or
a chip, or some croutons.

00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:21.380
CHERIE SORIA: Several.

00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:22.500
Crackers, chips.

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:23.800
DAN LADERMANN: --to
go with our salad.

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:24.930
CHERIE SORIA: And
maybe a pate--

00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:27.760
DAN LADERMANN: --which adds
crunch and fills it out.

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:31.830
And pate would add those seeds
which are high in minerals.

00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:33.840
And so it creates a balance.

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:36.890
And when we say a salad,
it's like--

00:31:36.890 --> 00:31:39.330
if we were eating at home at our
salad bar, we'd take like

00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:41.280
two of the plates
you guys have.

00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:41.760
CHERIE SORIA: At least.

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:42.470
Piled high.

00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:43.950
DAN LADERMANN: Or
we'd just take--

00:31:43.950 --> 00:31:46.740
the cafeteria tray
would work, too.

00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:47.590
But greens.

00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:48.910
So that's our key.

00:31:48.910 --> 00:31:52.040
And that's when we eat
the most meal.

00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:55.670
And by eating greens and salads
and not having the

00:31:55.670 --> 00:31:59.500
heavy foods, you stay
on all afternoon.

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:00.920
I noticed you have
an espresso bar.

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:01.840
That's really nice.

00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:04.610
But if you feel you need the
espresso, that's because

00:32:04.610 --> 00:32:07.490
something else has brought you
down, something that you ate,

00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:09.760
typically in the food,
something--

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:11.680
so you need to bring
that back up.

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:15.720
And then after a couple hours,
it just comes back down.

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:18.520
So if you find yourself kind
of nodding off in front of

00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:23.610
your monitor, that says
let's look at what you

00:32:23.610 --> 00:32:25.320
ate, a lot of times.

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:27.675
And one of things that we think
is really exciting, and

00:32:27.675 --> 00:32:30.500
it's great being able to come
to Google, is we can up the

00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:34.360
productivity of Google by like
10% just by helping people

00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:35.680
change what they eat.

00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:37.270
Can you imagine what that
would do to the

00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:40.170
bottom line of Google?

00:32:40.170 --> 00:32:41.330
They should be paying us--

00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:42.065
CHERIE SORIA: And each of you.

00:32:42.065 --> 00:32:43.460
DAN LADERMANN: And
each of you.

00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:45.150
They get a little more
productivity,

00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:48.370
maybe a better raise.

00:32:48.370 --> 00:32:51.180
A little bit, but it's all
about what we eat.

00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:53.610
CHERIE SORIA: And it might sound
boring to have a big

00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:56.910
salad for dinner-- or for,
sometimes for dinner, to--

00:32:56.910 --> 00:32:57.570
every day.

00:32:57.570 --> 00:32:59.890
But it's never boring, because
there's always different

00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:01.240
vegetables in season.

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:04.100
You can make different flavored
pates, different

00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:05.240
flavored dressings.

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:07.120
For me, I always look
forward to my salad.

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:09.910
And when we travel, salads
and green juices

00:33:09.910 --> 00:33:10.940
are what I miss most.

00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:12.360
We travel with a
small blender.

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:14.860
So we always manage to
have our smoothie.

00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:17.495
And we have our little green
powder, so that really helps.

00:33:17.495 --> 00:33:21.320
But having a really great
organic salad, oh my gosh,

00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:22.610
that's what I'm addicted to.

00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:25.730
And the reason is, I'm addicted
to feeling good.

00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:27.520
That's what I'm addicted to.

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:30.810
And when I don't have it,
I don't feel great.

00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:32.120
But it has to taste good.

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:33.550
And so that's one
of the things.

00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:35.550
We have a little bit
of time left.

00:33:35.550 --> 00:33:38.440
Yes, for dinner, we sometimes
also have a salad or we have a

00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:39.140
green soup.

00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:41.340
And we have recipes in
all of our books.

00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:44.230
But of course, our newest book
is "Raw Foods for Dummies."

00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:48.110
And in that book, as Elizabeth
was saying, we have a lot of

00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:48.860
little tips.

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:51.800
And by the way, if you do
Facebook, check out Raw Food

00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:54.580
for Dummies Facebook page,
because a lot of those little

00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:57.640
illustrations that she was
talking about in the book, we

00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:59.410
actually have videos
for those.

00:33:59.410 --> 00:34:03.270
So you see me actually cutting
into that mango, and actually

00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:06.060
showing how to chiffonade kale
and massage it and make it

00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:08.040
into something that looks
and feels and

00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:09.730
tastes like it's cooked.

00:34:09.730 --> 00:34:12.449
So if you go to Raw Food for
Dummies Facebook page, you can

00:34:12.449 --> 00:34:15.670
get a lot of free recipes and
other good information.

00:34:15.670 --> 00:34:18.030
And help yourself to more of
those samples, if you want.

00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:19.659
We still have more left.

00:34:19.659 --> 00:34:21.380
But I want to tell you
a little bit about

00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:24.270
not just that recipe--

00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:26.920
and I have everything set up
back here, but I think you

00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:29.429
would learn more from me telling
you what some of the

00:34:29.429 --> 00:34:30.989
flavors are that go into--

00:34:30.989 --> 00:34:34.250
I'll come around here--
that go into making

00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:35.810
something like this.

00:34:35.810 --> 00:34:37.060
This is the red bell pepper--

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:40.100
What is it called?

00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:41.719
Red bell pepper zucchini
hummus.

00:34:41.719 --> 00:34:44.199
That's right.

00:34:44.199 --> 00:34:47.404
And one of the most important
things when you're preparing

00:34:47.404 --> 00:34:50.150
food and you want to make it
taste great is to understand

00:34:50.150 --> 00:34:50.730
the flavors.

00:34:50.730 --> 00:34:52.330
And I've been mentioning
that a little bit.

00:34:52.330 --> 00:34:55.080
But here are the four flavors
that all chefs all over the

00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:56.730
world agree upon.

00:34:56.730 --> 00:34:58.670
Sweet, sour, salty and bitter.

00:34:58.670 --> 00:35:00.080
That's pretty easy
to remember.

00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:01.910
Sweet, sour, salty and bitter.

00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:06.560
And to make a great tasting
sauce or a great tasting meal,

00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:08.950
all of those flavors really
need to be present.

00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:12.930
Most Americans don't really
like the bitter flavors.

00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:14.310
Europeans do.

00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:17.150
But Americans really
prefer sweet.

00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:19.980
And so our dressings are usually
sweet, and we don't

00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:21.570
necessarily think about adding

00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:23.160
something bitter to a dressing.

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:26.270
We know we like sweet
and sour.

00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:27.900
And we know we like salty.

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:30.140
And so most of our dressings
have those

00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:31.590
flavors present in them.

00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:35.890
But dressings go on greens,
and greens are bitter.

00:35:35.890 --> 00:35:39.440
And so there are all of your
flavors right there.

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:43.450
Now in the raw food world, we
also separate another flavor.

00:35:43.450 --> 00:35:45.200
We call it pungent.

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:48.300
And the reason we separate it
is because when you cook

00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:50.830
pungent foods, you
mellow them.

00:35:50.830 --> 00:35:51.850
Think about an onion.

00:35:51.850 --> 00:35:53.670
Take a bite of an onion,
it's not so great.

00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:57.350
But if you cut it up and you
saute it, it becomes sweet.

00:35:57.350 --> 00:36:00.910
So with raw food preparation,
you have to treat onions a

00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:01.385
little differently.

00:36:01.385 --> 00:36:04.130
And we have a lot of different
ways of making them sweet, and

00:36:04.130 --> 00:36:06.650
taking out some of
the strength, the

00:36:06.650 --> 00:36:08.050
pungent juices of them.

00:36:08.050 --> 00:36:11.130
But one thing you can certainly
do is just use less.

00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:14.420
Or use onion powder, and that
gives you that little bit of

00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:18.630
an onion flavor without having
that big, bold strong onion.

00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:20.060
Same thing with garlic.

00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:23.620
Same thing with ginger, mustard
and horseradish.

00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:26.140
All those flavors are a
little bit strong if

00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:27.150
you don't cook them.

00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:30.190
So with pungent flavors, you
just hold back a little bit.

00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:32.830
Now if something is too sweet,
you can add something sour.

00:36:32.830 --> 00:36:35.410
If something is to sour, you
can add something sweet.

00:36:35.410 --> 00:36:37.430
So that you just bring balance,
is what you're

00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:37.980
looking for.

00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:39.000
Harmony.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.470
Think of it as a choir.

00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:43.420
Now with a choir, you want
to have different voices.

00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:46.220
Sometimes you want one to be
more in front of the others.

00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:47.240
You want something--

00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:49.290
maybe if you're making a ginger
sauce, you want to

00:36:49.290 --> 00:36:50.080
taste the ginger.

00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:52.240
You don't want it to blend
into the background.

00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:55.130
So ginger is going to be a
little bit stronger than all

00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:57.590
of the other flavors that
are there to support it.

00:36:57.590 --> 00:37:02.740
But if you make it too strong,
then it's not really--

00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:03.890
it hits you over the head.

00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:05.340
It's just not so much fun.

00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:08.460
So you do have to be careful
about how much of those

00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:10.350
stronger flavors you're using.

00:37:10.350 --> 00:37:14.360
And that's why we separate
those pungent flavors.

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:17.610
So if you remember sweet, sour,
salty, bitter and then

00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:19.340
something pungent for drama.

00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:20.480
We love drama.

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:23.100
And that's what creates those
big, bold flavors that I said

00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:23.980
that I like.

00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:25.630
I like to layer them.

00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:29.670
Now in this recipe that you just
tasted here, this sweet

00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:32.630
bell pepper and zucchini hummus,
I actually took it

00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:33.820
another step.

00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:36.290
And if you look, you see
the recipe that you

00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:37.880
have on your card.

00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:41.860
I actually put a little bit of
smoked paprika to give the

00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:46.170
bell pepper a little more of a
roasted taste, and I added a

00:37:46.170 --> 00:37:47.660
little bit of chipotle.

00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:51.430
So you'll notice that there's
a tiny bit of heat in there

00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:53.160
that you wouldn't
have otherwise.

00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:55.050
Now you could add cayenne
instead, if

00:37:55.050 --> 00:37:55.890
you wanted that heat.

00:37:55.890 --> 00:37:59.350
But chipotle has a little bit
of a smoky taste, too.

00:37:59.350 --> 00:38:02.550
And anything that's smokey
also is bitter.

00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:05.880
So in this recipe, we had quite
a few sweet things,

00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:09.850
because we can call peeled
zucchini sweet.

00:38:09.850 --> 00:38:11.710
It certainly isn't anything
other than that.

00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:14.870
It's not sweet if you think
of it compared to candy.

00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:17.940
But on the flavor chart, it's
more on the sweet side than

00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:19.030
anything else.

00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:20.380
The same thing with
bell peppers.

00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:22.720
Bell peppers are more
on the sweet side.

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:25.590
And so we balanced
it by adding some

00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:27.650
lemon for our acidity.

00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:30.710
And hummus usually has a
fair amount of acidity.

00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:33.130
And the acidity also helps
to balance some of the

00:38:33.130 --> 00:38:35.560
bitterness, and also
bring harmony to

00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:37.140
some of that sweetness.

00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:39.640
For pungent flavors,
we added cumin.

00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:41.200
We added garlic.

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:44.740
And as I said, we added the
chipotle spice and a little

00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:48.370
bit of paprika, which
is actually sweet.

00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:49.470
Paprika is sweet.

00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:52.350
But smoked paprika is bitter,
because any time you have

00:38:52.350 --> 00:38:54.240
something smokey, it's bitter.

00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:56.460
So all the flavors are there.

00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:59.910
And the question is, how much
of each do you add?

00:38:59.910 --> 00:39:02.790
Well, it's nice to start with
a recipe that's proven.

00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:04.800
All the recipes in all
four of my books

00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:07.330
are time-tested recipes.

00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:09.480
That's not going to be true
for all books, I know.

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:12.910
But if it's not true and you
choose a recipe that isn't

00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:16.490
perfect, if you understand
flavors, you can taste it and

00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:18.900
say, needs a little
bit of acidity.

00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:21.700
And the acidity could come from
lemon, lime, could come

00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:22.325
from orange.

00:39:22.325 --> 00:39:23.910
It could come from pineapple.

00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:25.220
Any kind of acid fruit.

00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:27.660
It doesn't have to be
whatever the recipe

00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:29.030
would have called for.

00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:31.740
So you can look in your fridge
and see what's acidic.

00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:32.910
You could even use vinegar.

00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:36.020
Although I hesitate to use
vinegar, because vinegar can

00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:37.610
cause digestive problems.

00:39:37.610 --> 00:39:40.160
So if you notice that you get a
little bit bloated after you

00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:43.450
eat a salad, pay attention to
whether or not the dressing

00:39:43.450 --> 00:39:45.450
had vinegar in it.

00:39:45.450 --> 00:39:47.410
I personally can't eat vinegar,
and so there's no

00:39:47.410 --> 00:39:50.970
vinegar in any of my books,
because I do notice that my

00:39:50.970 --> 00:39:54.200
waist band gets a little bit
tight when I eat anything with

00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:54.950
vinegar in it.

00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:57.230
And it's just not as
comfortable for me.

00:39:57.230 --> 00:40:00.640
And it does mean that I'm not
digesting my food as well.

00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:04.150
And digestion is an important
key to health.

00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:06.070
If you don't digest your
food well, you don't

00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:07.530
assimilate it well.

00:40:07.530 --> 00:40:09.520
And if you don't assimilate it
well, that means you're not

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:13.340
getting all the nutrients from
it that you need to get.

00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:17.190
So that's kind of the long and
short of the whole flavor

00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:18.080
balancing thing.

00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:20.650
If you ever do you decide to
come to our school at Living

00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:24.120
Light, you'll find that one of
the first things that you do

00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:26.280
is you have a flavor tasting.

00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:29.260
So we set it up kind of
like a wine tasting.

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:32.150
There are six categories on
a tray, with six different

00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:34.130
ingredients for each category.

00:40:34.130 --> 00:40:36.730
So there's a salty category,
a sweet category, a bitter

00:40:36.730 --> 00:40:38.540
category, and so forth.

00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:40.790
And there's also a category
for fats.

00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:44.680
And the reason is that fats
influence flavor.

00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:46.840
Now fat isn't a flavor
in itself.

00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:49.040
In fact, every fat has
its own flavor.

00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:52.640
For example, sesame
oil is bitter.

00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:53.860
Olive oil is bitter.

00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:55.020
Coconut oil is sweet.

00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:56.240
Avocado oil is sweet.

00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:58.140
So they have their
own flavors.

00:40:58.140 --> 00:41:01.320
And when you're choosing a fat
to go with a dish, you want to

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:04.110
think about what flavor
that fat has.

00:41:04.110 --> 00:41:07.800
Also, be aware of the fact that
adding some fat will help

00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:10.480
to unite the flavors
and bring the

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:12.740
flavors together in harmony.

00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:15.400
That doesn't mean that you
necessarily want to depend on

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:17.360
adding a lot of fat
to your diet.

00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:20.560
I'm not fat phobic, but keeping
your fat down to

00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:24.320
around 30%, not too much more
than 30%, which is not that

00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:28.550
hard to do, is really better for
your health than having a

00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:29.660
high fat diet.

00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:32.040
And that doesn't mean
that you have to be

00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:33.785
afraid of eating nuts.

00:41:33.785 --> 00:41:35.960
I'm not nut phobic.

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:38.790
You can have a nice little
handful of nuts in a day, and

00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:41.790
you can make it into cheese
or nut milk or

00:41:41.790 --> 00:41:42.990
just snack on nuts.

00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:45.270
Chew them well.

00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:49.820
So having a well balanced diet
and choosing foods that have

00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:51.460
nutrients are really
important.

00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:55.340
So try to stay away from the
foods that are empty calories,

00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:57.170
like pasta, fats.

00:41:57.170 --> 00:42:00.150
Oils are empty calories, and a
lot of calories there, that

00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:03.400
take the place of other foods
that could be nourishing you.

00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:06.600
So that's really important.

00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:11.610
Pastas and pastries and
white bread, or any

00:42:11.610 --> 00:42:12.430
kind of bread, really.

00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:14.430
Gluten is not a health food.

00:42:14.430 --> 00:42:17.470
So you want to think about
removing some of those high

00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:19.000
gluten foods in your diet.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.740
It would definitely serve you.

00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:24.450
So anyway, at Living Light, we
teach you about a lot of this.

00:42:24.450 --> 00:42:26.580
We teach you about flavor
balancing, how to make healthy

00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:29.050
living delicious, and
how to really

00:42:29.050 --> 00:42:30.760
have fun in the kitchen.

00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:34.950
And in our book, "Raw Food for
Dummies," we have a ton of

00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:38.550
information there for anybody,
whether they're just starting

00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:40.870
out or whether they've already
been on a raw food path for a

00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:42.540
while, including menus.

00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:46.480
And we have one 31-day menu
that tells you, if you're

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:50.270
making, say for example, an
almond cheese, when you should

00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:52.890
soak the almonds and actually
blend them with probiotic

00:42:52.890 --> 00:42:55.280
powder, how long it's going to
take before it's cheese.

00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:58.060
And then all these wonderful
recipes and ways to use it.

00:42:58.060 --> 00:43:03.100
So in the menu plan, it tells
you how to prep in advance so

00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:05.680
that you don't have to be in
the kitchen all day long,

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:07.790
because you can do little
tasks here and there.

00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:11.990
And it can be really, really
helpful to show you how you

00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:15.470
can make this lifestyle easy
and, most of all, delicious.

00:43:15.470 --> 00:43:18.110
Because if it's not delicious,
you probably would rather die

00:43:18.110 --> 00:43:20.140
than change your diet.

00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:23.210
And we don't want
that to happen.

00:43:23.210 --> 00:43:25.200
And we have five minutes left.

00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:26.890
And does anybody have
any questions?

00:43:26.890 --> 00:43:28.260
DAN LADERMANN: Come
on our front.

00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:31.410
AUDIENCE: I've got a mike
up here actually.

00:43:31.410 --> 00:43:33.340
DAN LADERMANN: And I'm going
to pass around-- we have a

00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:34.400
sign-up sheet here.

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:36.340
You can sign up to get
on our newsletter.

00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:39.500
If you're watching the video,
you can go to rawfoodchef.com

00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:40.610
to get on our newsletter.

00:43:40.610 --> 00:43:43.160
We send out lots of great
information and

00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:45.730
recipes every month.

00:43:45.730 --> 00:43:47.740
CHERIE SORIA: And we're going to
be giving away an Excalibur

00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:51.440
dehydrator, and also an Omega
high-speed blender.

00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:54.180
We're going to be doing that
the first of August or so.

00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:54.840
DAN LADERMANN: We're going
to do it at the end

00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:58.220
of this tour section.

00:43:58.220 --> 00:43:59.820
CHERIE SORIA: --which is
the end of July, 1st

00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:01.223
of August or so.

00:44:01.223 --> 00:44:02.090
AUDIENCE: Hi there.

00:44:02.090 --> 00:44:04.120
Thanks for the talk.

00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:06.460
I'm wondering, is there any
room for grains in the

00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:08.500
raw-oriented diet?

00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:11.070
I'm thinking of things
like brown rice, and

00:44:11.070 --> 00:44:13.700
I like cooked amaranth.

00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:15.710
Are there ways to incorporate
these types of grains?

00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:16.570
CHERIE SORIA: Amaranth.

00:44:16.570 --> 00:44:18.850
So the question has
to do with grains.

00:44:18.850 --> 00:44:21.690
Is there room for grains
in a raw food diet?

00:44:21.690 --> 00:44:24.230
First of all, a raw food diet
doesn't have to be all raw.

00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:27.080
You can make some good
cooked food choices.

00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:29.330
You can have steamed greens,
steamed grains.

00:44:29.330 --> 00:44:31.760
I recommend that they be
non-glutenous grains, just

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:35.350
because gluten can create
inflammation in your body.

00:44:35.350 --> 00:44:37.900
See how it makes you feel.

00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:40.890
Amaranth is a great,
ancient grain.

00:44:40.890 --> 00:44:42.980
Quinoa is one of my
favorite grains.

00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:46.110
And I definitely eat it on
a fairly regular basis.

00:44:46.110 --> 00:44:50.270
I also eat some steamed lentils
and other legumes.

00:44:50.270 --> 00:44:53.920
And I'm not afraid
of cooked foods.

00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:55.690
I just make good,
solid choices.

00:44:55.690 --> 00:44:58.070
So if they make you feel
good, then I think

00:44:58.070 --> 00:44:59.350
that that's just fine.

00:44:59.350 --> 00:45:01.100
And you can sprout grains.

00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:02.890
I know a lot of raw fooders
that sprout grains.

00:45:02.890 --> 00:45:05.805
Although brown rice, you
really can't sprout.

00:45:05.805 --> 00:45:06.810
It doesn't sprout.

00:45:06.810 --> 00:45:09.350
AUDIENCE: Another food
I like to is seaweed.

00:45:09.350 --> 00:45:12.090
Do you incorporate seaweed
in some of your dishes?

00:45:12.090 --> 00:45:12.830
DAN LADERMANN: Yeah,
absolutely.

00:45:12.830 --> 00:45:14.950
CHERIE SORIA: We're definitely
in favor of seaweed,

00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:17.810
especially if you're not eating
table salt, which I

00:45:17.810 --> 00:45:18.630
don't recommend.

00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:21.290
I recommend eating really good
quality, like Himalayan

00:45:21.290 --> 00:45:23.630
crystal salt, because
it's so pure, but

00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:24.820
you're not getting iodine.

00:45:24.820 --> 00:45:27.660
And so if you include sea
vegetables in your diet, then

00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:28.600
you're getting iodine.

00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:30.750
And that's a very important
nutrient.

00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:32.290
DAN LADERMANN: And
we love seaweed.

00:45:32.290 --> 00:45:34.595
Our school's in Mendocino,
right on the coast.

00:45:34.595 --> 00:45:38.010
So we're at one of the prime
seaweed harvesting places.

00:45:38.010 --> 00:45:42.280
A lot of times, we'll go out for
a walk on the beach, and

00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:45.130
we go out on a low tide and
we go out to the rocks and

00:45:45.130 --> 00:45:46.770
actually harvest the
seaweed and eat it

00:45:46.770 --> 00:45:47.780
right there, just graze.

00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:49.540
CHERIE SORIA: It's really fun.

00:45:49.540 --> 00:45:52.380
DAN LADERMANN: So,
good questions.

00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:55.050
And our experience is that, as
we said, you don't have to be

00:45:55.050 --> 00:45:56.960
raw 100% of the time.

00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:00.000
Even the leaders that were
part of a group, the

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.870
international leaders that get
together, is 80 raw is

00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:07.280
basically good, clean
food and you're

00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:08.350
watching what you're doing.

00:46:08.350 --> 00:46:12.710
And the things you ask about,
like the grains and even the

00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:16.026
brown rice and seaweed, those
are all-- and seaweed, most of

00:46:16.026 --> 00:46:18.760
the time, we eat it raw, too--

00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:20.100
are excellent things to
add to your diet.

00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:22.090
CHERIE SORIA: One of my favorite
cooked foods is

00:46:22.090 --> 00:46:22.990
steamed yams.

00:46:22.990 --> 00:46:25.190
Yams have a lot of
good nutrients.

00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:27.340
It's an orange, yellow
food, which is great.

00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:29.490
It's got the keratin in it.

00:46:29.490 --> 00:46:31.050
And you don't have to
put anything on it.

00:46:31.050 --> 00:46:32.050
You don't have to
put fat on it.

00:46:32.050 --> 00:46:33.190
You don't have to
put salt on it.

00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:34.760
A little cinnamon
is kind of fun.

00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:38.830
But that's a great food that
we love to eat in the

00:46:38.830 --> 00:46:41.920
wintertime when we want
something warm and nurturing.

00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:43.820
So I think our hour is up.

00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:44.250
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:46:44.250 --> 00:46:48.040
I have one last question for
you before we close.

00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:51.160
I know when people hear about
raw vegan foods, they think,

00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:52.510
oh, what's that?

00:46:52.510 --> 00:46:54.260
Is there a huge initial
investment?

00:46:54.260 --> 00:46:56.810
What are some key pieces of
equipment that you recommend

00:46:56.810 --> 00:46:57.680
people start with?

00:46:57.680 --> 00:46:59.230
CHERIE SORIA: Oh, that's
a really good question.

00:46:59.230 --> 00:47:01.170
What equipment do you
need to get started

00:47:01.170 --> 00:47:01.990
on a raw food diet?

00:47:01.990 --> 00:47:05.150
And the most important thing is
a good knife, a good knife.

00:47:05.150 --> 00:47:07.230
And a blender, and it doesn't
have to be an expensive

00:47:07.230 --> 00:47:10.050
blender, like this one
or like the Omega.

00:47:10.050 --> 00:47:11.690
You can start out with
a smaller blender.

00:47:11.690 --> 00:47:14.770
You just need to cut
things up smaller.

00:47:14.770 --> 00:47:18.130
It's nice to have a food
processor, but

00:47:18.130 --> 00:47:19.220
that can come later.

00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:21.770
And a dehydrator is fun, because
you can make crispy,

00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:23.990
crunchy snacks, like
kale chips.

00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:28.050
And if you have a garden, you
can dehydrate all your extra

00:47:28.050 --> 00:47:31.270
fruits and vegetables, and make
crackers and breads and

00:47:31.270 --> 00:47:31.930
things like that.

00:47:31.930 --> 00:47:35.210
We have a lot of recipes
for those in our book.

00:47:35.210 --> 00:47:37.300
And you don't need a stove.

00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:38.370
And you don't need a steamer.

00:47:38.370 --> 00:47:39.100
You don't need a frier.

00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:40.840
You don't need a waffle iron.

00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:43.100
There's a lot of things
you don't need.

00:47:43.100 --> 00:47:46.100
But the most important thing,
I would say, is

00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:47.360
a knife and a blender.

00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:49.440
DAN LADERMANN: And we have,
in "Raw Food for Dummies,"

00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:52.530
there's a whole section on
starting out simple, where the

00:47:52.530 --> 00:47:55.700
only thing you really need is
that inexpensive blender.

00:47:55.700 --> 00:47:58.290
Once you really get into it,
you'll probably find a high

00:47:58.290 --> 00:48:03.440
power blender, like a Vitamix or
an Omega or a Blendtech, is

00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:06.010
a really handy tool to have.

00:48:06.010 --> 00:48:09.950
And when I went from cooked food
to raw food, I traded in

00:48:09.950 --> 00:48:12.390
my Webber grill for a Vitamix.

00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:14.510
And it was really
a great move.

00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:16.110
But you don't have
to have that.

00:48:16.110 --> 00:48:20.510
The main thing is, get started
and get going on it.

00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:22.830
And there's a whole section,
also in "Raw Food for

00:48:22.830 --> 00:48:25.100
Dummies," about setting up
your raw food kitchen.

00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:27.910
So if you're going to go into
this more as a lifestyle, what

00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:30.070
do you need to do and how do
you organize your kitchen?

00:48:30.070 --> 00:48:31.680
How do you shop?

00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:34.720
What are some of those strange
ingredients now that you might

00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:37.620
see in a raw food recipe book
that maybe you weren't sure

00:48:37.620 --> 00:48:39.410
what it was before?

00:48:39.410 --> 00:48:40.730
So those are all in the book.

00:48:40.730 --> 00:48:42.370
CHERIE SORIA: And how do you
live in the real world?

00:48:42.370 --> 00:48:43.940
Like, what do you do
when you travel?

00:48:43.940 --> 00:48:46.270
How do you order when you
go to a restaurant?

00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:47.570
We covered all that stuff.

00:48:47.570 --> 00:48:51.822
So "Raw Food for Dummies" is
really for smart, busy people.

00:48:51.822 --> 00:48:52.990
AUDIENCE: That's great.

00:48:52.990 --> 00:48:54.630
