Hey guys, i'm Nate and today we are making fully functional metal ninja throwing stars

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.940
Hey guys, i'm Nate and today we are making fully functional metal ninja throwing stars

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.940
There is a link to a PDF to download this template for throwing stars of course you can go with other designs

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.840
But I like this one so I'm gonna be using it

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.620
I have this piece of 16 gauge steel

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:20.850
Which costs less than $7 and has enough metal in it to make a bunch of throwing stars to make these ninja stars...

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.329
we'll be using a hacksaw a drill with a few different bit sizes a

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.189
Metal file and a small belt sander to help myself be able to drill through the steel

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.199
I also have this nice little punch

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.880
when you push it down into the steel plate it compresses a spring up to a certain point and then

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:42.509
Slams down onto it using the harden tip to make a mark in the steel that really helps you aim your drill bit right where

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.430
You want it to go we have a variety of sizes. Let's start by making this medium small throwing star

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.719
We do want to glue this piece of paper down on to our plate of Steel

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.520
We're going to be using some spray glue, but you could also use a glue stick or just some Elmer's glue

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.739
We now want to use our hacksaw to cut this piece of steel out from the rest of the plate

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:23.440
We need to drill nine holes into this ninja star eight going around the outside and one in the middle

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.630
Let's start by taking our punch and marking into the steel the very center of each of those nine holes

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.900
Now that we've marked the nine spots that we need to drill

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.910
We'll use our smallest drill bit to drill pilot holes through each of those wider drill bits often

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:42.819
Have a hard time drilling into a flat piece of steel so drilling a pilot hole can really help the drill bit start cutting where

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.820
it needs to

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.669
With all nine holes drilled it's time to move back to the bench vise and hacksaw

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.589
One of our eight points is now cut out let's go all the way around and do that for the rest of them

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.799
Once we have our ninja star down to this point we want to remove any

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.850
Excess bit of the metal that still has the white paper attached to it

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.359
We're trying to get our profile to match the black lines pretty closely

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.869
For this we can either use a metal file, or a small belt sander

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.520
I've got this one inch belt sander and

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.740
Using that tends to heat up the steel really quickly so I've got a bowl of water that I can use to cool it down

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.229
So it doesn't burn my fingers while I finish sanding it

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.609
You've now got all of the edges cut down to where we want to so at this point

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:11.940
We can remove the paper with some fine grit sandpaper, and then start doing some cleaning up and maybe a little bit of decorating

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.150
Now let's use that sandpaper and our rounded metal file to just clean up some of the edges

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.880
Especially the inside of this throwing star has a very jagged edge, and we don't want to cut ourselves on that

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.129
Our ninja star is getting really close to being ready to use

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.540
But I think we need to add a tapered edge on both sides of each of our points once again

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.900
We could be using our file for this. I prefer to use the 1 inch belt sander

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.560
At this point with the edges added on if you like the all-metal look you could just say you're done right here

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.080
But I think that this is a ninja tool, and we should make it a little bit more stealth

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:07.369
Let's take some black paint and see if we can't add on that black surface to our whole star

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.179
Our ninja star is now painted black and it's looking very stealthy

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:20.090
But I think I want to sand off the paint on all the edges, so we just have that little gleam of metal

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:31.749
Our ninja throwing star is now complete and just to see how it would go

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.209
I also made one of the larger and smaller sizes

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:40.389
Let's take these bad boys outside and see how they do against some targets first up is an extremely easy target

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:44.079
It's just a block of styrofoam the ninja stars should stick into it really easily

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:49.749
Not bad with the small one

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.189
I'm a little concerned about how well it will stick into things because it doesn't have much weight behind it

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:56.949
But of course on styrofoam even it does a great job

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:06.399
Today we learned that I am NOT a ninja

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.689
Our little one doesn't really seem to have enough mass to penetrate this particle board

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:16.718
But the medium and the large ones seem to do pretty well

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:24.369
Right in between from 15 feet away

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.569
The logs are like pressed up against each other and I managed to thread the needle

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:31.718
And get the throwing star in between two of them

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:38.680
Because that's how good of a shot. I am I couldn't do it on purpose if I tried 100 times but

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:45.879
That's a worse way of throwing them

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:51.489
Guys we've still got more for you see that little box up at the top will transport you directly to our last video go check
