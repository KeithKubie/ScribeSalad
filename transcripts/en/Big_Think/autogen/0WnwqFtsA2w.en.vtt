the big variation in sensitivity comes
 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.440
the big variation in sensitivity comes
from that some people are extremely

sensitive and other people are pretty
 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.479
sensitive and other people are pretty
insensitive or maybe I should say even

but that there's this threat somehow of

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:40.090
but that there's this threat somehow of
 

00:33:40.090 --> 00:33:46.140
but that there's this threat somehow of
it being co-opted or change because that

00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:46.150
it being co-opted or change because that
 

00:33:46.150 --> 00:33:49.140
it being co-opted or change because that
I think it's more helpful because this

00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:49.150
I think it's more helpful because this
 

00:33:49.150 --> 00:33:50.670
I think it's more helpful because this
conversation about gentrification it

00:33:50.670 --> 00:33:50.680
conversation about gentrification it
 

00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:53.100
conversation about gentrification it
happens all over the world and it's a

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:53.110
happens all over the world and it's a
 

00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:55.290
happens all over the world and it's a
tragedy but the minute what I've been

00:33:55.290 --> 00:33:55.300
tragedy but the minute what I've been
 

00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:56.550
tragedy but the minute what I've been
thinking about is it's more useful

00:33:56.550 --> 00:33:56.560
thinking about is it's more useful
 

00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:58.980
thinking about is it's more useful
actually to pan out of this a little bit

00:33:58.980 --> 00:33:58.990
actually to pan out of this a little bit
 

00:33:58.990 --> 00:34:01.020
actually to pan out of this a little bit
and think about what this means in a

00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:01.030
and think about what this means in a
 

00:34:01.030 --> 00:34:02.640
and think about what this means in a
kind of why the framework which is this

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:02.650
kind of why the framework which is this
 

00:34:02.650 --> 00:34:05.730
kind of why the framework which is this
kind of symptomatic greed and the

00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:05.740
kind of symptomatic greed and the
 

00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:08.460
kind of symptomatic greed and the
exploitation of land for profit about

00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:08.470
exploitation of land for profit about
 

00:34:08.470 --> 00:34:11.640
exploitation of land for profit about
people and this you could okay yes it's

00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:11.650
people and this you could okay yes it's
 

00:34:11.650 --> 00:34:13.919
people and this you could okay yes it's
a it's a real shame south London's

00:34:13.919 --> 00:34:13.929
a it's a real shame south London's
 

00:34:13.929 --> 00:34:16.500
a it's a real shame south London's
changing my god it hurts but if we pan

00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:16.510
changing my god it hurts but if we pan
 

00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:18.419
changing my god it hurts but if we pan
out a little bit and we think about land

00:34:18.419 --> 00:34:18.429
out a little bit and we think about land
 

00:34:18.429 --> 00:34:20.909
out a little bit and we think about land
land is being exploited for profit the

00:34:20.909 --> 00:34:20.919
land is being exploited for profit the
 

00:34:20.919 --> 00:34:22.230
land is being exploited for profit the
people that live on that land are being

00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:22.240
people that live on that land are being
 

00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:23.370
people that live on that land are being
destroyed their communities their

00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:23.380
destroyed their communities their
 

00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:24.930
destroyed their communities their
cultures being destroyed listen just

00:34:24.930 --> 00:34:24.940
cultures being destroyed listen just
 

00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:26.310
cultures being destroyed listen just
happening in cities this is happening

00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:26.320
happening in cities this is happening
 

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:28.020
happening in cities this is happening
all over the world it's happening to the

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:28.030

rainforest in Peru you know it's like

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:30.970
rainforest in Peru you know it's like
 

00:34:30.970 --> 00:34:34.980
rainforest in Peru you know it's like
there is agreed that is running running

00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:34.990
there is agreed that is running running

the world yeah it's greed oh no there's

00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:38.050
the world yeah it's greed oh no there's
 

00:34:38.050 --> 00:34:40.230
the world yeah it's greed oh no there's
no empathy and I think that alienation

00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:40.240
no empathy and I think that alienation
 

00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:43.470
no empathy and I think that alienation
happens not only to the communities that

00:34:43.470 --> 00:34:43.480
happens not only to the communities that
 

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:45.960
happens not only to the communities that
are destroyed but to the Destroyers as

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:45.970
are destroyed but to the Destroyers as
 

00:34:45.970 --> 00:34:48.150
are destroyed but to the Destroyers as
well I mean I just think that the world

00:34:48.150 --> 00:34:48.160
well I mean I just think that the world
 

00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:50.520
well I mean I just think that the world
that is built up upon the wreckage of

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:50.530
that is built up upon the wreckage of
 

00:34:50.530 --> 00:34:53.700
that is built up upon the wreckage of
these communities is also a world in

00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:53.710
these communities is also a world in
 

00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:56.040
these communities is also a world in
which it's difficult to form community

00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:56.050
which it's difficult to form community
 

00:34:56.050 --> 00:34:58.350
which it's difficult to form community
like new communities yeah I don't know I

00:34:58.350 --> 00:34:58.360
like new communities yeah I don't know I
 

00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:01.320
like new communities yeah I don't know I
mean I don't know I've never lived in a

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:01.330
mean I don't know I've never lived in a
 

00:35:01.330 --> 00:35:04.770
mean I don't know I've never lived in a
I don't know i think that like this has

00:35:04.770 --> 00:35:04.780
I don't know i think that like this has
 

00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:07.350
I don't know i think that like this has
to go both ways so if i say that you

00:35:07.350 --> 00:35:07.360
to go both ways so if i say that you
 

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:09.600
to go both ways so if i say that you
know i love people and that I'm for

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:09.610
know i love people and that I'm for
 

00:35:09.610 --> 00:35:12.180
know i love people and that I'm for
people I can't be just for people that I

00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:12.190
people I can't be just for people that I
 

00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:13.400
people I can't be just for people that I
already agree with

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:13.410
already agree with
 

00:35:13.410 --> 00:35:15.930
already agree with
like this has to go both ways you have

00:35:15.930 --> 00:35:15.940
like this has to go both ways you have
 

00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:18.089
like this has to go both ways you have
to recently I've been thinking okay so

00:35:18.089 --> 00:35:18.099
to recently I've been thinking okay so
 

00:35:18.099 --> 00:35:19.890
to recently I've been thinking okay so
you need to empower even the very

00:35:19.890 --> 00:35:19.900
you need to empower even the very
 

00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:21.960
you need to empower even the very
powerful to be more real with themselves

00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:21.970
powerful to be more real with themselves
 

00:35:21.970 --> 00:35:24.029
powerful to be more real with themselves
that right actually actually think about

00:35:24.029 --> 00:35:24.039
that right actually actually think about
 

00:35:24.039 --> 00:35:26.670
that right actually actually think about
the cost the only thing I can think to

00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:26.680
the cost the only thing I can think to
 

00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:29.069
the cost the only thing I can think to
say is just empathy you just need more

00:35:29.069 --> 00:35:29.079
say is just empathy you just need more
 

00:35:29.079 --> 00:35:31.799
say is just empathy you just need more
empathy it's very easy for artists

00:35:31.799 --> 00:35:31.809
empathy it's very easy for artists
 

00:35:31.809 --> 00:35:34.349
empathy it's very easy for artists
anybody to basically cut themselves off

00:35:34.349 --> 00:35:34.359
anybody to basically cut themselves off
 

00:35:34.359 --> 00:35:36.150
anybody to basically cut themselves off
from all the rest of that humanity and

00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:36.160
from all the rest of that humanity and
 

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:38.220
from all the rest of that humanity and
find some way to categorize people and

00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:38.230
find some way to categorize people and
 

00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:41.970
find some way to categorize people and
say like oh that person is too you know

00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:41.980
say like oh that person is too you know
 

00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:44.549
say like oh that person is too you know
that's a greedy corporate person or

00:35:44.549 --> 00:35:44.559
that's a greedy corporate person or
 

00:35:44.559 --> 00:35:46.109
that's a greedy corporate person or
that's of this person or that you know

00:35:46.109 --> 00:35:46.119
that's of this person or that you know
 

00:35:46.119 --> 00:35:47.609
that's of this person or that you know
what I mean like I think it's hard for

00:35:47.609 --> 00:35:47.619
what I mean like I think it's hard for
 

00:35:47.619 --> 00:35:51.059
what I mean like I think it's hard for
anyone to remind themselves mmm and try

00:35:51.059 --> 00:35:51.069
anyone to remind themselves mmm and try
 

00:35:51.069 --> 00:35:53.549
anyone to remind themselves mmm and try
to figure out how to like not shut off

00:35:53.549 --> 00:35:53.559
to figure out how to like not shut off
 

00:35:53.559 --> 00:35:55.650
to figure out how to like not shut off
it's so difficult because part of me

00:35:55.650 --> 00:35:55.660
it's so difficult because part of me
 

00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:57.779
it's so difficult because part of me
just recoiled and kind of wishes that

00:35:57.779 --> 00:35:57.789
just recoiled and kind of wishes that
 

00:35:57.789 --> 00:36:00.809
just recoiled and kind of wishes that
the world was kind of run by these

00:36:00.809 --> 00:36:00.819
the world was kind of run by these
 

00:36:00.819 --> 00:36:03.240
the world was kind of run by these
reptilian monsters the reality is that

00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:03.250
reptilian monsters the reality is that
 

00:36:03.250 --> 00:36:04.799
reptilian monsters the reality is that
they're human beings yeah these are

00:36:04.799 --> 00:36:04.809
they're human beings yeah these are
 

00:36:04.809 --> 00:36:05.910
they're human beings yeah these are
human beings that are making these

00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:05.920
human beings that are making these
 

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:08.430
human beings that are making these
decisions and and so at the beginning of

00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:08.440
decisions and and so at the beginning of
 

00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:09.599
decisions and and so at the beginning of
this conversation we were talking about

00:36:09.599 --> 00:36:09.609
this conversation we were talking about
 

00:36:09.609 --> 00:36:11.579
this conversation we were talking about
you know whether this kind of grappling

00:36:11.579 --> 00:36:11.589
you know whether this kind of grappling
 

00:36:11.589 --> 00:36:13.799
you know whether this kind of grappling
between what we're capable of and what

00:36:13.799 --> 00:36:13.809
between what we're capable of and what
 

00:36:13.809 --> 00:36:16.980
between what we're capable of and what
we are what are inherent nature is and

00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:16.990
we are what are inherent nature is and
 

00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:18.750
we are what are inherent nature is and
actually why I believe that inherently

00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:18.760
actually why I believe that inherently
 

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:21.150
actually why I believe that inherently
we are physiologically empathetic beings

00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:21.160
we are physiologically empathetic beings
 

00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:22.769
we are physiologically empathetic beings
right there was there was a study that

00:36:22.769 --> 00:36:22.779
right there was there was a study that
 

00:36:22.779 --> 00:36:25.829
right there was there was a study that
yeah that took place where I learned

00:36:25.829 --> 00:36:25.839
yeah that took place where I learned
 

00:36:25.839 --> 00:36:27.240
yeah that took place where I learned
about this in the Science Museum in

00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:27.250
about this in the Science Museum in
 

00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:28.559
about this in the Science Museum in
London so I know it's true right it's

00:36:28.559 --> 00:36:28.569

okay though they took two strangers put

00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:31.450
okay though they took two strangers put
 

00:36:31.450 --> 00:36:33.720
okay though they took two strangers put
them in a room separated by a glass

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:33.730
them in a room separated by a glass
 

00:36:33.730 --> 00:36:36.450
them in a room separated by a glass
partition and one of them stood on a

00:36:36.450 --> 00:36:36.460
partition and one of them stood on a
 

00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:38.880
