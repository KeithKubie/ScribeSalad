sexist and racist speech along these

00:29:56.970 --> 00:29:56.980
sexist and racist speech along these
 

00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:59.900
sexist and racist speech along these
lines and forms of blasphemy could be

00:29:59.900 --> 00:29:59.910
lines and forms of blasphemy could be
 

00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:02.970
lines and forms of blasphemy could be
used in this kind of way so I think we

00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:02.980
used in this kind of way so I think we
 

00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:04.860
used in this kind of way so I think we
could imagine situations in which would

00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:04.870

be a kind of hate speech that could

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:07.120
be a kind of hate speech that could
 

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:09.000
be a kind of hate speech that could
conceivably be punished but that's a

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:09.010
conceivably be punished but that's a
 

00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:11.940
conceivably be punished but that's a
very narrow category there would be more

00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:11.950
very narrow category there would be more
 

00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:15.000

shortly in few words but it's suppose it
could be developed for me the denial of

00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:24.190
could be developed for me the denial of
 

00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:28.500
could be developed for me the denial of
the genocide is part of the genocide

00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:28.510
the genocide is part of the genocide
 

00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:33.630
the genocide is part of the genocide
itself it is part of the genocide it is

00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:33.640
itself it is part of the genocide it is
 

00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:36.480
itself it is part of the genocide it is
very clear in the genocide against Jews

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:36.490
very clear in the genocide against Jews
 

00:40:36.490 --> 00:40:39.630
very clear in the genocide against Jews
as you know the structure of the

Himmler and so on said not only we will

00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:51.310
Himmler and so on said not only we will
 

00:40:51.310 --> 00:40:54.930
Himmler and so on said not only we will
kill them but we are going to erase the

kill them but we are going to erase the
trace of the killing the denial is part

00:40:59.310 --> 00:40:59.320
trace of the killing the denial is part
 

00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:03.380
trace of the killing the denial is part
of the crime same for the Armenians the

00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:03.390
of the crime same for the Armenians the
 

00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:06.990
of the crime same for the Armenians the

00:41:06.990 --> 00:41:07.000
committal the executioner's of the low
 

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.380
committal the executioner's of the low
cost of the Armenians said exactly the

00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:10.390
cost of the Armenians said exactly the
 

00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:11.140
cost of the Armenians said exactly the
same it

00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:11.150
same it
 

00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:16.480
same it
is not enough to kill we have to at the

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:16.490
is not enough to kill we have to at the
 

00:41:16.490 --> 00:41:20.080
is not enough to kill we have to at the
same time in the same movement in the

00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:20.090
same time in the same movement in the
 

00:41:20.090 --> 00:41:23.020
same time in the same movement in the
same breathing we have to commit and

00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:23.030
same breathing we have to commit and
 

00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:26.590
same breathing we have to commit and
erase the crime so there is a very

00:41:26.590 --> 00:41:26.600
erase the crime so there is a very
 

00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:30.370
erase the crime so there is a very
peculiar structure of genocide it is not

00:41:30.370 --> 00:41:30.380
peculiar structure of genocide it is not
 

00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:33.370
peculiar structure of genocide it is not
a crime as another one there is a

00:41:33.370 --> 00:41:33.380
a crime as another one there is a
 

00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:37.150
a crime as another one there is a
peculiar structure which having the

00:41:37.150 --> 00:41:37.160
peculiar structure which having the
 

00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:42.640
peculiar structure which having the
denial integrated in the crime makes the

00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:42.650
denial integrated in the crime makes the
 

00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:46.780
denial integrated in the crime makes the
possibility and imposes I think the

00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:46.790
possibility and imposes I think the
 

00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:50.920
possibility and imposes I think the
necessity of finishing the denial which

00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:50.930
necessity of finishing the denial which
 

00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:53.470
necessity of finishing the denial which
is part of the crime I'd like Kent and

00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:53.480
is part of the crime I'd like Kent and
 

00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:57.070
is part of the crime I'd like Kent and
peter also to address this so I think

00:41:57.070 --> 00:41:57.080
peter also to address this so I think
 

00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:58.600
peter also to address this so I think
there is an argument about whether it

00:41:58.600 --> 00:41:58.610
there is an argument about whether it
 

00:41:58.610 --> 00:42:01.030
there is an argument about whether it
should be not allowed in European

00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:01.040
should be not allowed in European
 

00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:03.520
should be not allowed in European
countries but I your reasons struck me

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:03.530
countries but I your reasons struck me
 

00:42:03.530 --> 00:42:06.580
countries but I your reasons struck me
as quite implausible for the following

00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:06.590
as quite implausible for the following
 

00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:09.490
as quite implausible for the following
reason assuming that the part of the

00:42:09.490 --> 00:42:09.500
reason assuming that the part of the
 

00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:11.020
reason assuming that the part of the
idea of genocide or that particular

00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:11.030
idea of genocide or that particular
 

00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:13.120
idea of genocide or that particular
genocide was that it was also going to

00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:13.130
genocide was that it was also going to
 

00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:16.450
genocide was that it was also going to
be covered up that was part of what it

00:42:16.450 --> 00:42:16.460
be covered up that was part of what it
 

00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:19.150
be covered up that was part of what it
was but now we're generations later and

was but now we're generations later and
 

00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:21.460
was but now we're generations later and
the question is should people be able to

00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:21.470
the question is should people be able to
 

00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:23.650
the question is should people be able to
deny that that existed or not it to me

00:42:23.650 --> 00:42:23.660
deny that that existed or not it to me
 

00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:25.060
deny that that existed or not it to me
it wouldn't make any difference suppose

00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:25.070
it wouldn't make any difference suppose

it wouldn't make any difference suppose
there a basic idea have been let's
