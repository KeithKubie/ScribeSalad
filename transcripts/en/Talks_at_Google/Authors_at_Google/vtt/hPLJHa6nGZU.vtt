00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:03.060
&gt;&gt; Male Presenter: Good afternoon.

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.250
We're very pleased to have a double
dose of Authors at Google today.

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.840
In fact, we have two
books from the Bestselling and Philosophy

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:10.920
series.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.090
Our
first speaker is Tyler Shores.

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.139
And Tyler Shores is no
stranger to the Authors at Google program.

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.560
In fact, he
was a one of the early founders and was involved

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.900
for many years
before he left the to pursue a graduate degree

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.020
in English
literature from the University of Oxford.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.810
He's a
frequent contributor to this Blackwell Philosophy

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.300
series
including Heroes and Philosophy which he spoke

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.920
with us a
few years ago in the authors at Google channel.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.969
And also
Alice in Wonderland and the very soon to be

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.160
released Arrested Development and Philosophy.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.239
Steve Holt that's going to be
awesome.

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.100
He also taught a class on the Simpsons and
Philosophy at the University of California

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.100
at Berkeley.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.399
So
he's very in tune to the subject matter.

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.239
He will be
speaking to us today about The Girl with the

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:57.319
Dragon
Tattoo and Philosophy.

00:00:57.319 --> 00:01:00.739
So, without further ado, we must
go deeper.

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:02.890
&gt;&gt; Tyler: All right.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.320
Thanks, Cliff.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.460
It is good to be back.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.250
And let's see where do I start?

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.470
Well, I read recently
that The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is the

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.110
most popular
e-book,the best selling e-book of all time.

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.400
All time
in a relative sense because when we're talking

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.810
about e-books, we're not talking about that
long.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:24.830
But that made me
think.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.420
I do tend to read a lot of books on my Kindle
now.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.360
And I was thinking the funny thing is, in
a

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.751
completely Kindle or Nook or Android tablet
world, I probably never would have read the

00:01:35.751 --> 00:01:37.330
Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.250
And the reason for that is
I distinctly remember where I was when these

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:43.680
books came
on my radar.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.410
I was at the Denver Airport, at the Hudson
Booksellers store.

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.980
I mean, there are
some people in this world I guess.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.930
Let me back up for a
second.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.460
Some people notice the brand of shoes that
other

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.460
people wear.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.280
Some people notice other people -- can't
help but stare at other people's babies.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.230
I'm that other
type of person.

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.990
I can't help but notice what types of
books that other people read.

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.000
That's my personal story to the
Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.799
In a world without the
public visibility of book covers, you'd never

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:18.340
know what
people are reading, right?

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.430
So it wasn't really the first
person or second person but probably the third

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.700
or fourth
person I saw at that same airport who was

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.709
reading the
Girl with the Dragon Tattoo -- who was holding

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.710
this
book -- and I finally said, "Okay, what's

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:31.970
the deal with
this book?

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.290
What's so interesting about it?"

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.020
So that's
really the point of this talk to kind of think

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.020
about
these questions.

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.640
Pose some questions about the book and
give some thought to what is it about the

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.799
Girl with the
Dragon Tattoo that's so interesting?

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:50.370
What's
philosophically significant about it?"

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.370
On the one hand.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.879
I mean, these novels are we might call a typical
example of

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:56.299
hardboiled crime fiction.

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.640
They're very much like, if
you're a fan of the genre, Mickey Spillane,

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.190
or Raymond Chandler, or Sue Grafton.

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.650
They're
crime novels, detective novels.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.450
But, on the other hand,
I think there is something about the Girl

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.099
with the Dragon
Tattoo books.

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:16.090
They're fictions, but they're based on
very non-fictional issues and themes.

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.200
We know that the original
title -- the Swedish title for the Girl with

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.189
the Dragon
Tattoo -- was Men Who Hate Women.

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:25.540
And the reason for
this title stems from an actual event that

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.239
had a very
serious effect upon the author, upon Stieg

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:29.540
Larsson.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.579
Time
to read a brief excerpt from a news article.

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:36.819
It will
give more context for this I think.

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:40.200
[reading]On that day, 15-year-old Stieg watched
three friends

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.599
rape a girl whose name was Lisbeth, who was
the same

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:45.769
age as him and someone he knew.

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:48.440
Her screams were
heart-rending, but he didn't intervene.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.129
His loyalty to
his friends was too strong.

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:52.909
He was too young, too
insecure.

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:57.590
It was inevitable that he would realize
afterwards that he could have acted and possibly

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.299
prevented the rape.

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:03.749
Haunted by feelings of guilt, he
contacted the girl a few days later.

00:04:03.749 --> 00:04:08.260
He begged her to
forgive him for cowardice and passivity.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.780
She told him
bitterly that she could not accept his explanations.

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.380
"I
will never forgive you, ever," she said.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.729
So in some ways
the three books -- the books in the series

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:23.410
-- are meant
to be a survival story about a girl named

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.950
Lisbeth and
it's a story about survival and justice and

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.030
revenge.

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.120
The
three girl novels also have an uncompromising

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.120
moral
purpose.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.840
At the very end of the book, there's a very
clear statement when one of the main characters

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.819
says
quote -- when it comes down to it, this story

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:44.750
is not
primarily about spies and secret government

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.509
agencies,
it's about violence against women and the

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:49.440
men who enable
it.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:55.060
So again, the question is why are these books
so popular.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.110
And I think I would start with the obvious
which is sex

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.000
and violence.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.870
So let's talk about sex and violence for a
second.

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.170
Because that's one of the things -- hallmarks
or markers of

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:07.160
these kinds of books, popular fiction books.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.690
The message about sexual
violence against women is painfully clear

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.300
if you've read
the books.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.370
Some of the descriptions are brutal.

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.270
And one
of the most provocative chapters in the book

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:20.870
that we
wrote, the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.590
Philosophy, the
question is raised what effects does reading

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.210
about these kind of books, these
graphic depictions of sex and violence have

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.140
upon us as
readers?

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:38.599
Aristotle is one of our favorite ancient Greek
philosophers in the poetics he talks about

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:40.740
the cathartic
effects that these kind of descriptions have,

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:45.180
these graphic, violent images have -- that
fear and pity are

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.169
the primary undistilled emotions that we might
feel.

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:52.180
But
it puts us in the shoes of these vulnerable

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:53.180
characters.

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.872
And in that sense,
I guess the point is, that the Girl with the

00:05:54.872 --> 00:05:58.620
Dragon Tattoo
isn't about senseless violence or pointless

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:59.620
violence.

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.389
It
is about, in a larger sense, the social vulnerability

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:05.509
of
women specifically abuse -- psychological,

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:09.509
sexual
physical, political abuse that happens against

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:11.610
these like dependent people.

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.919
So there is a larger
political message that these thrilling crime

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:20.159
novels are
supposed to get to.

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:22.700
And I think that is one of the
things -- that's one of the key things that

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.020
makes the
Girl with the Dragon Tattoo kind of a socially

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.310
conscious
popular fiction.

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:31.729
So this idea of social -- I don't know
what to call it -- moral consciousness is

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:34.349
one of the
things we discuss in our book in the Girl

00:06:34.349 --> 00:06:37.010
with the Dragon
Tattoo and Philosophy.

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:40.039
There's a lot of interesting moral
questions raised along the way about the ethics

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:45.600
of
information, about revenge, about -- one of

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.629
the things I
think we'd be interested in here at Google

00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:51.449
is, certainly, how our
identity is shaped in an online age.

00:06:51.449 --> 00:06:54.699
That's something
that comes up again and again with characters

00:06:54.699 --> 00:06:56.490
who are
computer hackers.

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:59.360
To what extent do we control the
identity we have.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.169
To what extent is it something that is kind
of shaped by

00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:06.139
outside influences that we never see or hear
about?

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:07.800
So
there's interesting themes here.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:12.439
I think there's a lot
of different questions the book series deals

00:07:12.439 --> 00:07:13.490
with.

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:15.669
And
you might say that the Girl with the Dragon

00:07:15.669 --> 00:07:17.830
Tattoo books
are popular, I think, because some of the

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:21.659
larger themes of the book
strike a cord with us.

00:07:21.659 --> 00:07:25.719
It's a crime novel but because of
the author's background, Stieg Larsson was

00:07:25.719 --> 00:07:28.310
a journalist, a crime
reporter.

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:32.200
It's meant to be sort of
an exposé, too, an attempt to reveal the

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:36.510
sort of moral bankruptcy of
these people in power.

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:39.009
Throughout the books, there's a
certain sense of comeuppance for those people

00:07:39.009 --> 00:07:40.849
who get
away with bad things.

00:07:40.849 --> 00:07:44.550
And more importantly, there's an
examination, especially in the third book,

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:47.009
the Girl Who
Kicked the Hornet's Nest, the last book in

00:07:47.009 --> 00:07:49.169
the trilogy.

00:07:49.169 --> 00:07:52.789
It's about how society chooses
to treat people it doesn't understand and

00:07:52.789 --> 00:07:56.419
about how social labels
are applied or misapplied.

00:07:56.419 --> 00:07:57.849
What happens to those
consequences.

00:07:57.849 --> 00:08:01.860
What happens when certain people are
characterized in society and the kind of,

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:05.249
you know, wrong
consequences -- wrong conclusions that brings

00:08:05.249 --> 00:08:06.249
us to.

00:08:06.249 --> 00:08:09.139
And
that's the other thing that makes this unique.

00:08:09.139 --> 00:08:12.030
It's a
little different than a crime novel book in

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:14.729
the sense
that you might wonder who are the bad guys

00:08:14.729 --> 00:08:15.729
in the book?

00:08:15.729 --> 00:08:19.669
And I think that's one of the things that
separates this.

00:08:19.669 --> 00:08:21.819
For one thing, there's a long list.

00:08:21.819 --> 00:08:24.039
The bad guys in the book: the doctors are
crooked.

00:08:24.039 --> 00:08:25.550
The bureaucrats are crooked.

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:27.999
The journalists
are crooked.

00:08:27.999 --> 00:08:29.060
The business men are crooked.

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:32.240
The police and the prosecutors are crooked
and bad.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:37.240
So it's old question, Quis custodiet ipsos
custodes.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.169
Who will watch the
guards.

00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:40.440
Who watches the watchmen.

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.450
That kind of question
that comes up again and again.

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:46.740
Like, that's a larger
theme in this book series.

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:53.140
When there's an interesting
article by 'N Plus One, if anyone reads that

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:58.100
online magazine, where
the writer talks about how Stieg Larsson is

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:00.149
discussing the
welfare state in Sweden.

00:09:00.149 --> 00:09:03.470
The welfare state has a certain
amount of complicity in these crimes that

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:05.720
happen all
throughout these books over like decades of

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.570
what happens
in Sweden and what happens to the characters.

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:11.230
If you
can't trust the system, who can you trust?

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:12.690
What are you
supposed to trust?

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:16.150
The role of the state is supposed to
take care of the individual, as the line of

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:17.200
thinking goes.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:20.940
But with the corruption that's going on in
the books, 'take

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:23.800
care of' takes on a different meaning more
of like the Mafia

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:27.010
sense how exactly is the government complicit
in these sort of

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:28.010
things.

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:31.500
So anyways, the point is the villains of the
book aren't necessarily just the characters,

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.750
there the
institutions, the social structures that kind

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:36.110
of allow these
crimes happen.

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:39.420
I think that's one of the things that
makes this book unique.

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:40.740
It's not just a mystery novel.

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:45.310
It's supposed to be a mystery novel with a
more politically minded, politically motivated

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:47.560
purpose to it.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.480
There's different kinds of bad guys and therefore
there

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.300
have to be different kinds of good guys.

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:54.230
So it's kind of
significant, the fact that the two main characters

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:59.180
in the Girl With the Dragon Tattoo are journalists
and a computer hacker whose purpose is to

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:04.220
bring
information that's hiding out into the public.

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:06.810
One of
the things I talk about in the book is that

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:10.940
this kind of writing, like
socially conscious writing, is what Jean-Paul

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:13.610
Sartre calls
committed literature.

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:17.260
Committed literature is basically
the -- any writing that was with the intention

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:18.260
of social
commitment.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:23.050
Any kind of writing that was supposed to
advocate or inspire real change in the world.

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:24.920
And
reading these books, reading the Girl with

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:29.010
the Dragon
Tattoo books, there is a sense of moral purpose

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:32.060
that's
not so obvious with detective fiction.

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:34.510
I mean, for the
one thing let's start with the Girl with the

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:35.510
Dragon
Tattoo.

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:39.820
Like, it's a murder mystery and as we see
it's about a

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:42.260
lot more than just about a murder mystery
if you kind of

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.090
read the books through the end.

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:46.880
At one point, I don't
want to spoil the book or the movie which

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:51.330
is coming out
next week, I think.

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:57.899
There's a serial murderer who's been
committing crimes throughout the decades.

00:10:57.899 --> 00:11:01.730
One of the
questions is why did this person murder people

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:03.779
or torture
people after so many years.

00:11:03.779 --> 00:11:06.240
The answer is supposed to make your skin crawl.

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:12.420
The murderer says, "because it's so easy to
murder people

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:15.670
who disappear that never have these crimes
brought

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:16.680
today."

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:21.680
And I think that says a lot about the society
that Stieg Larsson thought he was writing

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.600
about.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.350
The
other thing I would bring up is that you know

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:28.830
like I just
said that kind of emotional skin-crawling

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:33.670
feeling is
something worth thinking about.

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:36.029
Sometimes when we're
reading a book -- like, sometimes our heart

00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:37.579
starts to
beat a little faster.

00:11:37.579 --> 00:11:40.820
Sometimes our palms do get
slightly sweaty.

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:47.350
These are real physical reactions that
happen to, you know, things that don't exactly

00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:48.350
exist.

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:49.350
So
this is kind of interesting.

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:50.430
We've all had this
experience.

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:52.589
Like, we're watching a movie or reading a
book.

00:11:52.589 --> 00:11:55.750
We
develop real emotional reactions about something

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:56.750
that
doesn't exist.

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:58.500
Like, these characters aren't real.

00:11:58.500 --> 00:11:59.959
These situations aren't real.

00:11:59.959 --> 00:12:03.690
In philosophy, we call
this the paradox of fiction.

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:04.690
How does this happen?

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:05.830
Why does this happen?

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:08.010
We
empathize with certain fictional characters.

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:11.480
We have like an
emotional connection; an emotional investment

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:12.830
on our part.

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:14.949
We feel fear, pity, happiness.

00:12:14.949 --> 00:12:17.010
We
have these real emotional and psychological

00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:21.920
responses to
fictional events we know aren't actually real.

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.230
In
philosophy, like, you know, again this is

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:25.230
sort of a
paradox.

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:28.480
This is something to think about because I
think it's something we've all experienced

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:31.579
and like from a
logical standpoint it's worth thinking about.

00:12:31.579 --> 00:12:33.860
It's worth
thinking about why do we have real reactions.

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:38.290
Why do we
care about fictional characters that don't

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:39.540
exist?

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:42.009
Speaking of characters -- I think without
a doubt one of

00:12:42.009 --> 00:12:44.460
the things that makes the books so popular
are the

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:49.040
character's in the book specifically Lisbeth
Salander because

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.170
she's so unique.

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:53.290
In particular, like, she's the Girl with
the Dragon Tattoo.

00:12:53.290 --> 00:13:01.180
She's this sort of computer-hacking,
ass-kicking, weird, revenge-driven, antisocial,

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:05.699
loner
person but who's also at the same time emotionally

00:13:05.699 --> 00:13:07.980
socially vulnerable.

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:09.680
We empathize with a character like
that.

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:13.310
Someone who's gotten an extremely raw deal
in her

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:14.310
life.

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:21.110
She's the kind of protagonist we want to relate
to.

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:23.089
Speaking specifically about the Girl with
the Dragon

00:13:23.089 --> 00:13:28.260
Tattoo, as either book, or a movie or as a
plot, it's a different

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:29.260
sort of book.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:33.560
Like, at one point it's described as --
it's actually a fascinating case.

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:36.350
What I believe is
known in the trade is a locked room mystery

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:38.910
on the island
and nothing in the investigation seems to

00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:40.250
follow normal
logic.

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:41.860
Every question remains unanswered.

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:44.200
Every clue
leads to a dead end.

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:48.650
So the question is like one of the
things I talk about in the book is what kind

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:52.230
of book
exactly is the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo?

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:53.290
It's a best
seller.

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:55.720
It says best seller right here on the top
of the

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:56.720
cover.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.490
And there's something to that.

00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:00.759
Like, what I'm
interested in is that there's something to

00:14:00.759 --> 00:14:01.759
that.

00:14:01.759 --> 00:14:02.759
Like
this kind of book.

00:14:02.759 --> 00:14:05.350
Like, what does a best seller mean to
us exactly?

00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:08.110
The experience of the book -- I guess the
way I think about it.

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:10.389
This is sort of my English background.

00:14:10.389 --> 00:14:13.850
Reading a book is something that happens,
it's a transaction that happens between us,

00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:16.449
like a reader reading
words on a page.

00:14:16.449 --> 00:14:20.389
But the question of what kind of book are
we reading and how we read it is sort of shaped

00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:23.110
by
things outside of us.

00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:27.880
I think this is something worth
thinking about.

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:32.810
There's a lot of cultural factors that I
think come into play here.

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:35.139
That kind of shape our
understanding of what, like, popular fiction

00:14:35.139 --> 00:14:38.950
or what a best
seller is as opposed to, like, literature.

00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:41.500
So in that
sense one of the questions I've been thinking

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:42.500
about this
a lot.

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:43.850
The question of: what does literature mean
to us, exactly?

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:46.149
What is
the difference between, like, a literature,

00:14:46.149 --> 00:14:48.930
a popular
fiction book, genre fiction book and natural

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:51.110
work of
literature?

00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:52.250
Is there a distinction to be made?

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:53.250
Does it
matter?

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:54.810
Who makes that decision for us?

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:57.819
Like, for
example, this is just one book I borrowed

00:14:57.819 --> 00:15:00.630
from my library,
Gravity's Rainbow.

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:02.440
Can you judge a book by its cover?

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:05.089
I mean, not really; no.

00:15:05.089 --> 00:15:07.519
Sometimes the cover and the outsides do tell
you

00:15:07.519 --> 00:15:08.519
something.

00:15:08.519 --> 00:15:09.519
I mean, look at it -- it's huge.

00:15:09.519 --> 00:15:12.009
Like, it's
serious business, right, if it's a big, thick

00:15:12.009 --> 00:15:13.160
book like this.

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.630
I
mean, obviously no, that's not the whole point.

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:17.810
But on the
other hand there are different kinds of social

00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:18.810
markers.

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:21.090
If you look at these types of books -- this
is a Penguin

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:22.149
version of the book.

00:15:22.149 --> 00:15:25.310
It says literature on the back
cover of the book here.

00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:26.310
That's interesting.

00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:27.959
Where
do these distinctions come from about what

00:15:27.959 --> 00:15:29.470
makes a book
popular fiction.

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:30.470
What makes it literature.

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:33.170
What makes it a mystery or a romance
novel?

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:36.060
And the answer is, you know, a number of things.

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:38.310
There's no one thing that does this.

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:40.630
Book publishers do
this when they put labels like this on the

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:41.630
book.

00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:43.250
Bookstores do
this when they put the Girl with the Dragon

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:45.920
Tattoo like in
the mystery section, or the best seller section

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:48.519
instead of
literature section.

00:15:48.519 --> 00:15:54.220
We do this when we write critical
books on philosophy about these sort of books.

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:55.220
Universities do this.

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:56.370
Libraries do this.

00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:58.230
Book reviews
do this.

00:15:58.230 --> 00:15:59.920
It all contributes to the way that we think
about

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:02.350
these books whether they're best sellers,
or novels,

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:04.930
or literature, whatever you want to call them.

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:06.990
It's
interesting.

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:12.690
It's a classic 'chicken or the egg' paradox
situation like, "is a work of fiction literature?

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:15.060
Is
something like this supposed to be literature

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:17.480
because we
think of it as literature and therefore we

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:18.480
read it that
way?

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.529
Or is it something only literature after the
fact.

00:16:20.529 --> 00:16:25.630
We read it and somehow it's decided we treat
it as

00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:26.970
literature now?

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:32.910
I mean, speaking very generally like one
of the things I think we can say safely is

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:35.629
there is a
difference between this sort of book, like

00:16:35.629 --> 00:16:37.069
popular fiction.

00:16:37.069 --> 00:16:38.350
It's a
serial nature of a book.

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:39.400
They're books in a series.

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:41.790
Like, when you read a book in a series like
this, like

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:45.930
Twilight or Harry Potter or the Girl With
the Dragon Tattoo books.

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:46.930
You're reading them
horizontally.

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:49.580
You're reading them quickly but they're
supposed to be page turners.

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:52.230
They're supposed to be the
books you want to get to the end and find

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:53.440
out what
happens next.

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:56.050
So you're reading it this way you're
reading it sequentially.

00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:58.589
In literature, you're supposed
to be reading more vertically.

00:16:58.589 --> 00:17:02.120
You don't necessarily
read books all the way through to the end.

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:04.449
Works of literature, you're reading for depth.

00:17:04.449 --> 00:17:09.280
You
might read them over and over again.

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:11.939
At the peak of the
Girl with the Dragon Tattoo mania, the New

00:17:11.939 --> 00:17:15.860
Yorker had a
funny quote which I thought was worth sharing.

00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:19.760
They
said, "we're not looking at Tolstoy here -- talking

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:22.380
about
the style of Larsson's writing."

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:27.400
And that's true -- we're
not looking at Tolstoy but so what?

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:30.740
We like Larsson novels
because they're good stories; they're enthralling

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:36.380
stories
with interesting characters that are compelling.

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:37.919
And there's
something else to them, too.

00:17:37.919 --> 00:17:40.850
I think that something else
is supposed to be this kind of moral seriousness

00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:43.169
which I
hinted at before.

00:17:43.169 --> 00:17:45.789
There's an undeniably blunt reality to
the books.

00:17:45.789 --> 00:17:49.410
In the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, each
section of the book is prefaced with these

00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:51.470
very real
statistics.

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:56.750
One of them said 40 percent of women in
Sweden had been subjected to violence by a

00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:58.140
man.

00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:00.630
So the
stories themselves may not -- may be works

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:03.200
of fiction,
but the crimes in which the novels are based

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:05.559
are far from
fiction which is the point I want to make.

00:18:05.559 --> 00:18:09.159
So the question I through out before, why
do we

00:18:09.159 --> 00:18:11.260
feel the way we do about fiction?

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:14.230
A related question is
why do we enjoy reading the fiction that we

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:15.230
do?

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:19.080
In some ways
the argument that I'm making is a good fiction,

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:23.260
a good
mystery novel, is a lot like philosophy.

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:26.350
As much as we
enjoy the thrill of reaching the end of the

00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:28.140
mystery,
philosophy shows us that sometimes it's about

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:30.230
the
process; it's about the thinking through of

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:32.100
getting there
that is the actual thing.

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:36.340
It's not so much the end goal
as it is what we do along the way.

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:37.340
That's what mysteries
are.

00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:41.690
It's the unfolding of bits and pieces of
information that we find so interesting.

00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:45.900
Lisbeth Salander
says at one point.

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:49.080
It makes it sound like she's a good a philosopher
as she was detective.

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:51.039
She wasn't actually
interested in the answer.

00:18:51.039 --> 00:18:54.510
It was the process of the
solution that was the point.

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:58.350
There's something
philosophically satisfying, I think, about

00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:01.390
the plot on the
of the detective novel in the sense that search

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:04.070
for
answers yields tidy resolution.

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:07.120
Like, you know, we have
all our answers set at the end of whatever

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:08.390
it is we're
reading.

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:13.030
So in a philosophical sense, part of the
consolation that we seek in reading fiction

00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:16.140
is this kind
of reassuring sense that truth can be found.

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:17.970
When we
think about the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:19.950
books,
there's questions that kind of propel us to

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:21.340
read these
things.

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:25.480
The search for truth is really like the driving
thing that motivates us to read these books.

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:27.409
How did Harriet Vanger disappear?

00:19:27.409 --> 00:19:31.920
Who murdered Dag Svensson and Mia Johansson?
who was behind the big

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:35.419
government Zalachenko cover-up?

00:19:35.419 --> 00:19:36.740
What did all the evil mean?

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:39.290
These
are questions that have clear definite answers

00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:41.150
by the end
of the book series.

00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:45.799
So unlike the clear resolution of
some works of fiction, our real life experience

00:19:45.799 --> 00:19:49.030
-- it's
true -- our real life experience with the

00:19:49.030 --> 00:19:51.030
truth is never
quite so neat and tidy.

00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:54.240
We never have like
resolutions that are so cut and dried at the

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:59.220
end of the
mystery novel that everything wraps up nicely.

00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:03.809
Alfred Whitehead, one of the philosophers
I talk about in the

00:20:03.809 --> 00:20:06.980
book is -- there are no -- he says there are
no whole

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:07.980
truths.

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:08.980
All truths are half truths.

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:09.980
I think that's a
good way to think about it.

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:14.430
So I want to wrap up with a
couple of thoughts.

00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:17.330
And feel free to ask any questions
if you have them.

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:22.400
When we reflect on the reasons why we
read and want to reread books in general and

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:25.470
why we would want to read the
Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, we might consider

00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:27.190
the
following question.

00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:29.809
What does reading actually mean to us?

00:20:29.809 --> 00:20:32.130
Why read fiction at all?

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:34.169
Is reading
supposed to be a form of escapism?

00:20:34.169 --> 00:20:38.850
Do we do it as a kind
of mental break from our boring everyday lives?

00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:40.330
Or is there something else?

00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:42.820
Do we
read in order to find engagement in the world

00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:47.360
as a way to
inform the way that we live our experiences?

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:51.120
So anyways these
are just some questions I wanted to pose.

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:52.730
Our hope in
writing the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:55.380
Philosophy is
to encourage everyone, fans of the books or

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:57.960
fans of philosophy, to think about these questions.

00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:59.950
So
I think I'll leave off with that and I'll

00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:02.250
turn the table
over to Kyle.

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:05.400
&gt;&gt;Male #1: This may be a loaded question especially
without

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:09.000
seeing the movie that's coming but how much
of the

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.020
Philosophy do you think is at risk of being
lost when

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:15.260
they turn it into a movie around two hours
long.

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:18.309
&gt;&gt; Tyler: That's a good question.

00:21:18.309 --> 00:21:21.270
Have you seen the Swedish
version of the movie?

00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:28.130
So there are changes that
happen -- I mean, there's always going to

00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:31.539
be that problem
with sanitizing like, you know, the sort of

00:21:31.539 --> 00:21:34.659
books to make
it a happy ending sort of thing.

00:21:34.659 --> 00:21:38.860
So like, in the Swedish
version in the ending of the movie, Lisbeth

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:45.210
has more, like,
an active role getting to the bad guy at the

00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:46.210
end.

00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:47.960
There
are those sort of things that make it a lot

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:50.060
less
ambiguous which is the point of the book.

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:52.750
There's a lot
of moral gray area in the Girl with the Dragon

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:53.750
Tattoo.

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:54.750
That's the point.

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:57.159
There are like good guy characters who do
bad things, like

00:21:57.159 --> 00:21:59.559
kill people and those sort of things.

00:21:59.559 --> 00:22:00.559
It is kinda lost.

00:22:00.559 --> 00:22:01.590
Like, I do worry about that.

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:05.630
I
worry about that happy ending syndrome.

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:09.679
As an English
major, I was appalled by Pride and Prejudice,

00:22:09.679 --> 00:22:11.410
the most recent one.

00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:13.100
They
totally killed the ending.

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:14.100
Don't see it.

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:15.100
It's a bad
movie.

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:16.100
[laughter] They do that.

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:17.380
They tend to do that sort of thing.

00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:18.380
I do worry about that.

00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:19.409
But I think
it's always.

00:22:19.409 --> 00:22:20.409
Hmmm?

00:22:20.409 --> 00:22:21.409
&gt;&gt;Male #1: [inaudible]

00:22:21.409 --> 00:22:22.659
&gt;&gt;Tyler: Yes, it is for the adventurous.

00:22:22.659 --> 00:22:23.659
That probably helps.

00:22:23.659 --> 00:22:26.241
Yeah, I mean,
that's a good question though.

00:22:26.241 --> 00:22:28.159
I think that always
happens.

00:22:28.159 --> 00:22:30.780
Personally -- and this brings up another
question which is interesting.

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:35.100
Do people tend to read
the books first or movies first?

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:36.570
I prefer reading the
books first.

00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:38.919
But there's an argument to be made that when
you

00:22:38.919 --> 00:22:41.620
watch the movie first you get more out of
the book.

00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:44.450
You're pleasantly surprised by things you
wouldn't have seen in

00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:45.520
the movie.

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:47.559
Yeah, interesting.

00:22:47.559 --> 00:22:54.679
&gt;&gt; Male Presenter: Thank you very much, Tyler.

00:22:54.679 --> 00:22:57.730
&gt;&gt; Tyler: Thank you.

00:22:57.730 --> 00:22:58.740
[Applause]
