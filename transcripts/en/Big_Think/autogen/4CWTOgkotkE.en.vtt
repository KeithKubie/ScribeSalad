superpowers level of power than it was
 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.340
superpowers level of power than it was
in the past and when it comes to

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350
in the past and when it comes to
 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.140
in the past and when it comes to
economic size Europe is larger than the

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150
economic size Europe is larger than the
 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.880
economic size Europe is larger than the
United States the European Union is the

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890
United States the European Union is the
 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.310
United States the European Union is the
largest economy in the entire world it

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320
largest economy in the entire world it
 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.810
largest economy in the entire world it
is significantly larger than that of the

as well their product standard safety

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959
as well their product standard safety
 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.320
as well their product standard safety
standards and so technical standards are

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330
standards and so technical standards are
 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.670

population decline of course in Italy
 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.310
population decline of course in Italy
and Germany are among them and by

you're up as a union continues to grow

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910
you're up as a union continues to grow

its population as a whole continues to
 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.910
its population as a whole continues to
grow if by European population decline

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920
grow if by European population decline
 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.860
grow if by European population decline
you mean the few Western European

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870

that absolute number may be declining

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240
that absolute number may be declining
 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.260
that absolute number may be declining
but if by European you mean a large

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270
but if by European you mean a large
 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.750
but if by European you mean a large

populations of course we don't think of

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270
populations of course we don't think of
 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:55.730
populations of course we don't think of
them as European but they think of

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740
them as European but they think of
