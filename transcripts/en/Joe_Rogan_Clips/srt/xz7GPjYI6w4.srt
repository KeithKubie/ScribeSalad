1
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:08,160
Hello you on. Hi. Charlie was crazy man.
What's happening? Yeah, good. I've just,

2
00:00:08,161 --> 00:00:11,310
we're just saying we want to cover the, I
uh, I've met a note to myself that says,

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,480
talk slow, talk American because although
I spend about half the year here,

4
00:00:15,481 --> 00:00:16,260
we British people,

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,810
there's a reorientation where you
suddenly realize I was once in a, uh,

6
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,450
an Ihub in cactus Arizona and I
was saying to the woman, right,

7
00:00:24,451 --> 00:00:27,990
like I'll have some pancakes, whatever
it was. And she kept looking at me going,

8
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:32,850
what? I know after about
literally three minutes, she goes,

9
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,650
do you speak English? That's like,
let people fucking invented it. Right.

10
00:00:37,651 --> 00:00:40,650
But no one was there to laugh at my such
cause they didn't understand what the

11
00:00:40,651 --> 00:00:44,010
fuck I was saying. Arizona is a
strange place. I really love Arizona.

12
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,670
There's great parts. Like Phoenix is
amazing. Tucson's a great place too,

13
00:00:47,671 --> 00:00:50,460
but it's a wild west sort of a state.

14
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,930
It's one of those weird hold over states
and have a lot of weird old school laws.

15
00:00:54,931 --> 00:00:59,430
Like, like a, I think you could just
walk around with a gun. Yeah, you can.

16
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,450
My main experience in Phoenix
was in Arizona in fact,

17
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,260
was going out with a group of women
who were made to go out on a chain gang

18
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,950
wearing tee shirts saying I was a drug
addict when members of the public mock

19
00:01:10,951 --> 00:01:11,970
them in Jira at that right.

20
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:14,580
Cause written this book about very
spoke about the war on drugs and I said,

21
00:01:14,581 --> 00:01:19,320
Joe Arpaio, sheriff our Pio, no longer
sheriff now thankfully. But uh, yeah,

22
00:01:19,321 --> 00:01:22,230
and it was, yeah, Arizona is a
deeply weird place. It's weird.

23
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:27,110
A lot of really nice people,
but it's 150,000 degrees. Yeah.

24
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,240
Well literally almost nobody lived
there until I conditioning was invented.

25
00:01:30,241 --> 00:01:30,860
Right.

26
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:34,170
You see what I once met a horrendous
mistake in fact in Phoenix where I had to

27
00:01:34,171 --> 00:01:36,990
walk somewhere and I could see on
the map it was like a mile away.

28
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,460
So it's not just walk,
it's fine.

29
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,220
And I got like halfway there and people
are literally stopping that car is going,

30
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:42,241
are you okay?

31
00:01:42,241 --> 00:01:46,050
Because the only reason anyone would ever
walk in eggs was basically if your car

32
00:01:46,051 --> 00:01:49,740
had broken down the car to them. I might
have actually just chosen to walk. Right.

33
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,720
Plus you're so white guy.

34
00:01:51,721 --> 00:01:56,721
I'm literally like a tomato
with a Brazilian who would
literally just look up my

35
00:01:56,941 --> 00:02:01,570
body and laugh and be like, you're
so white. How can a human be so like,

36
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:04,200
right. I don't always, I
never have a nice color.

37
00:02:04,201 --> 00:02:07,590
Like I'm either this albino
color or red rock. I never,

38
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,190
there's no rich brown hue
that none of my ancestors,

39
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:16,320
the Scottish and Swiss. So they never saw
the sun. Right. And none of my ancestors,

40
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:19,970
my friend Jamie was over my house
once and he's not this friend Jamie,

41
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,310
different friend Jamie who's
a British as well. And um,

42
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:25,110
my daughter who was a at the time,

43
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:29,230
I think she was like 10 or something
like that, she goes, she goes to my wife,

44
00:02:29,231 --> 00:02:33,090
she goes, mommy, he's so white. She,
and she goes, yeah. She goes, no, no,

45
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:37,800
like he's white, like
paper. So from then on,

46
00:02:37,801 --> 00:02:40,110
Jamie became Jamie White,
like paper,

47
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,910
very accurate description of my
lack of pigment is currently true.

48
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:48,180
It's funny that we, how much we
appreciate the English accent though.

49
00:02:48,181 --> 00:02:52,830
The English accent is like one of the
best tools for selling things to very

50
00:02:52,831 --> 00:02:53,880
gullible Americans.

51
00:02:53,881 --> 00:02:56,850
Whether it's like people benefit from
constant positive discrimination in the

52
00:02:56,851 --> 00:02:57,660
United States.
Right?

53
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,990
It's like having a 10 inch Dick just
having a British accent people cause they

54
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:05,560
like, oh my God, you got an accent at
all. Humans have accents. I've just got a,

55
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:05,920
you know,

56
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,230
let's say to provide itself a cherished
one we looked at were really into it.

57
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,730
It makes you feel like you're
more sophisticated. You're,

58
00:03:12,731 --> 00:03:17,260
you're more well read. They're
more aware of the world. I mean,

59
00:03:17,261 --> 00:03:20,380
I just am sophisticated
and well ride anyway. No,

60
00:03:20,381 --> 00:03:22,720
but you've got this
called stood. Um, yeah.

61
00:03:22,721 --> 00:03:26,890
Coastally people ascribing to you much
better qualities than you actually have.

62
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,800
But what does it work in
reverse? Like in, in England?

63
00:03:29,801 --> 00:03:33,400
What is the reaction to American
accents is it's mostly discussed, right?

64
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:38,590
I don't know. There's a
mixture. Americans, we grow.

65
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,290
I always think like the relationship
with Britain and America,

66
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:44,800
it's like I'm one of those police mirrors
because we grow up constantly looking

67
00:03:44,801 --> 00:03:47,320
at the United States, right?
We're constantly staring through.

68
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,920
We are immersed in American culture,
right?

69
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,720
When Americans look back cause they're
just seeing like a reflection of

70
00:03:52,721 --> 00:03:53,141
themselves.

71
00:03:53,141 --> 00:03:55,940
I mean Americans watched Downton Abbey
and know about like the queen or whatever,

72
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,640
but there isn't that two way dialogue that
there is that the, the, the, you know,

73
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:02,860
the, yeah, so it's a slightly weird,

74
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:06,090
so I think we feel very American,
right?

75
00:04:06,091 --> 00:04:08,650
And I spent half of the year here and I,
you know,

76
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,190
every now and then you come up against
these deep cultural differences that

77
00:04:12,191 --> 00:04:15,280
you're just like, oh fuck, okay. Right.
This is really not my culture. Right?

78
00:04:15,281 --> 00:04:18,730
And it's those moments of disorientation
or a really strange, like,

79
00:04:18,731 --> 00:04:21,400
give me one if for an example.
Well,

80
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:26,430
there's a question that Americans ask
all the time that I have literally never

81
00:04:26,591 --> 00:04:30,780
heard of European ass, right? I asked
the question, what's your story? Right?

82
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,670
Every American,
you can go to the most crusty,

83
00:04:33,671 --> 00:04:37,480
right wing person coming out and Mara
Largo or a kid in West Baltimore and you

84
00:04:37,481 --> 00:04:39,910
can say, well, it's your story.
And they'll have an answer.

85
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,720
The only context I can imagine a British
person saying, what's your story?

86
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:47,350
Would be in a police interrogation.
It would be an extremely hostile question.

87
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,760
What's your story? Right? It would be,
you just wouldn't ever say it, right?

88
00:04:51,761 --> 00:04:55,300
We don't Americans narrativize their
lives in a way I absolutely love.

89
00:04:55,301 --> 00:04:58,570
And as a journalist who writes books about
like depression and addiction and you

90
00:04:58,571 --> 00:05:01,660
want people to talk about their lives,
it's an unbelievable gifty, right?

91
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,340
That people will tell you,

92
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,200
I've never once been on
a bus in Mississippi and
sitting next to a woman and

93
00:05:08,201 --> 00:05:09,650
within five minutes of chatting tell,

94
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:13,000
she told me about like her two
miscarriages, how her mother hated her.

95
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,820
And I thought if we were
switched where my dad's from,

96
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:19,660
you wouldn't tell me this until we got
married and maybe not even that. Right?

97
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:23,950
So there's a level of candor and
storytelling among Americans.

98
00:05:23,951 --> 00:05:26,620
It's one of the best things
about this, this, this, you know,

99
00:05:26,621 --> 00:05:30,490
fucked up an amazing place. I just love
it. There's something about, there's a,

100
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:34,750
there's a kind of a narrative openness
that's very different about this place

101
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:39,400
than Europe, anywhere in Europe. Now
when you talk to people in England,

102
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,110
you guys don't have the
same level of social media,

103
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:48,760
not social media, but of
um, reality television. You
have some like big brother,

104
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,120
but you don't have it to the extent that
we have it here. Right? Yeah, it hasn't,

105
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,330
well, I mean your country has literally
been taken over by reality television,

106
00:05:55,331 --> 00:05:57,830
right? We have a relative
term president. Uh, no,

107
00:05:57,831 --> 00:06:00,410
it hasn't conquered the whole
culture in that way. Well,

108
00:06:00,411 --> 00:06:04,040
he's a reality television president, but
he's sort of a game show host president.

109
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,400
Like that's how I used to describe
myself and I was hosting fear factor.

110
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,360
They were like, you host a reality
show, Mike, sort of, it's a game show.

111
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,100
It's just a fucked up game show.

112
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:17,210
It's like Trump was hosting a
game show essentially. Right.

113
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:21,200
It was a contest. It wasn't like
keeping up with the Kardashians.

114
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:26,320
That's in true reality show because
there's literally nothing going on other

115
00:06:26,691 --> 00:06:30,620
than these people's lives and whatever
orchestrated bullshit they put in to make

116
00:06:30,621 --> 00:06:32,870
it more interesting. Yeah. I
hadn't thought about it that way.

117
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,080
I think this class because,

118
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:38,810
but I think that's part of the thing
that it was getting to about Americans

119
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,640
always wanted to give you their narrative.

120
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:43,910
They always want to give you the story
of their life. So when someone says,

121
00:06:43,911 --> 00:06:46,460
what's your story? They already
have it ready. You know?

122
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:51,630
Cause it's almost like we feel like
we're in some sort of a small television

123
00:06:51,681 --> 00:06:54,410
show all the time or some
sort of small production.

124
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,400
It's like almost a part of our who we are.
Yeah.

125
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,920
Every American can thinks that the
star if their own movie. Right.

126
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,000
And I forget who said this,
but someone realize, you know,

127
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:05,000
sometimes in life you realize that
you're just the extra, right? Yeah.

128
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:08,480
You'll do the, you're in the corner of
the shawl. Right, right. And, um, yeah,

129
00:07:08,481 --> 00:07:09,560
I think that's true.
And I think that's,

130
00:07:09,561 --> 00:07:14,060
that's not as true of British
people or I think there's certain,

131
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:18,170
how to put it. Like there's a
certain kind of self deprecation.

132
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:20,210
You're taught as a British person,
you're taught.

133
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:24,590
And I had to kind of unlearn it living
here. So what would be examples? Uh,

134
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,330
I forget where I read this story,
so maybe it's not true,

135
00:07:26,331 --> 00:07:30,350
but I remember in it years ago, so we
had these terrible subway bombs in 2005,

136
00:07:30,351 --> 00:07:34,010
I'm sure you remember for young British
men go onto the London Underground and

137
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:38,930
murder, I think it was over 50 people
and two weeks later, another group of,

138
00:07:38,931 --> 00:07:42,740
um, jihadis tried to do the same thing,
but they hadn't built the bombs very well.

139
00:07:42,741 --> 00:07:46,940
So they go down into the subway
and the owl, there's a loud bang,

140
00:07:46,941 --> 00:07:48,650
but it doesn't connect with the detonator.

141
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,170
So there's a loud bang but
doesn't actually blow everyone up.

142
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:55,280
Obviously people freak the fuck out, as
you can imagine. Right. And I forget,

143
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,570
maybe this isn't,

144
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:59,420
maybe this is a story that someone
told them that wasn't factually true,

145
00:07:59,421 --> 00:08:01,070
but he's, I think it reveals
something very, very,

146
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:05,630
something about British character.
Cause if I remember rightly, um,

147
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:09,020
three of the bombers escape on the escape
on the day in a court like a few hours

148
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,270
later and one of them's caught on
at the time, right. And someone,

149
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:15,320
I think it was an off duty fire officer
in the story chases after them for ages,

150
00:08:15,321 --> 00:08:19,370
chasing after the guy for ages while
everyone else is running the fuck away and

151
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,320
you can't just the guy and
he throws him to the ground.

152
00:08:21,321 --> 00:08:24,230
And what he said to him was that the
opportunity fire officer says to the

153
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,370
attempted suicide bomber,
you rude, rude man. Right.

154
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:31,630
And what I love about that is like the
idea that suicide bombing is just like

155
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:36,110
bad manners. It's like it's just
impolite, right? Or even a better example,

156
00:08:36,111 --> 00:08:38,240
which is true. It was reported
at the time, definitely was um,

157
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:42,920
during the riots we had in
2011, uh, in London, um,

158
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,600
there was one place,
I forget where it is,

159
00:08:44,601 --> 00:08:47,770
where they broke into a luxury goods
store and they could only make a,

160
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:50,450
it was a very strong window so they could
only make a hole in the corner of the

161
00:08:50,451 --> 00:08:55,451
window and it was caught on the security
cameras that the rioters formed a to go

162
00:08:55,531 --> 00:08:57,030
in and look at the store.
Right.

163
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:00,990
That's how deep the idea of like Keurig
and making a line is in British culture.

164
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,480
Even in a riot where like,
I don't know,

165
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:06,810
I think you where you were before me right
there. I've got to chill out in front.

166
00:09:06,811 --> 00:09:07,980
Isabelle Bank. Hey, he lives in,

167
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:10,460
he lives in London and she liked if I
her phone to be able to, she read that.

168
00:09:10,461 --> 00:09:13,490
I'd be like, you fucking English. You
don't know how to riot this and I'm Roger.

169
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,670
Probably a Q. What's wrong
with you people? Right?

170
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:20,310
You guys don't have black Friday sales.
Do you know? They've just started. Yeah.

171
00:09:20,311 --> 00:09:23,760
It's an unfortunate business. Might
be the end of you. Humility. Exactly.

172
00:09:23,761 --> 00:09:26,130
We're not going to make it.
We survived.

173
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:28,860
The Nazis were not fucking
survive in black Friday. Right?

174
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,700
There's something about those deals when
people get that bargain and then they

175
00:09:32,701 --> 00:09:37,640
open that door ready, go and people pile
through. All humanity gets tossed aside,

176
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:41,610
get you in this line to the
fucking financial desperation
of ordinary Americans.

177
00:09:41,611 --> 00:09:42,900
Right?
It's a little bit of that,

178
00:09:42,901 --> 00:09:46,410
but it's also the competitive nature of
those things where you're trying to grab

179
00:09:46,411 --> 00:09:51,411
the few remaining items that are 25%
off and even saving for this TV for six

180
00:09:51,721 --> 00:09:52,111
months,

181
00:09:52,111 --> 00:09:55,170
and there it is right in front of you
and you charge and people are fighting

182
00:09:55,171 --> 00:09:59,880
left and right. It's awful. It says
it's just a terrible way for people to,

183
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,320
you know,
interact with each other.
