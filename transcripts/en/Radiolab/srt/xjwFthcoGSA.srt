1
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,530
You're listening to radio lab from New
York public radio, public radio, w.

2
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,310
C. N. N. P. R. I'm Jad Abumrad and I'm
Robert Krulwich and this is radio lab.

3
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:22,360
You ever wondered why it is,
um, that all living things die?

4
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,520
I do wonder about that actually,
which it keeps me up at night,

5
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,880
which always leads me to the
next question. Do we have to,

6
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:34,650
do I have to the topic of our show as a
matter of fact and the natural place to

7
00:00:34,651 --> 00:00:38,070
begin to look for an
answer. [inaudible] a rush.

8
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:47,410
[inaudible] here we are in your
garage. Three are in my garage.

9
00:00:47,411 --> 00:00:52,180
The owner of this particular garage is
one Leonard Hayflick. He is a biologist.

10
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,710
He takes me to the corner
where he's got this above.

11
00:00:56,711 --> 00:00:58,430
So describe what we're
looking at here. Well,

12
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,220
what we're looking at is I barrel
shaped a device, metal canister,

13
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:08,030
metal. The side is shaped kind of
like a thermos except big opening.

14
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:11,980
He twists off the top and

15
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:16,263
look at that.

16
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:21,060
Out comes all of this smoke dry ice
from Halloween is what it looks. Well,

17
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,890
this look at hydrogen is
used in a lot of movies.

18
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:28,120
He reaches his hand into the liquid
nitrogen fog right into the bowels of this

19
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:30,610
canister and pulls out, and
this is what I'd come to see,

20
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,390
what some test tubes,

21
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:40,570
boobs in which these
animals are cut immediately.

22
00:01:40,571 --> 00:01:44,360
They're not how much to look at. If you
know what's in there, it's almost holy.

23
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:48,170
Each tube has millions of
frozen human cells in there,

24
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:53,260
and these cells have completely changed
how we think about mortality and

25
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:58,140
mortality. And You keep it in
your garage. Yes. Why? I mean,

26
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,930
I think it's pretty cool,
but why? Why it goes,

27
00:01:59,931 --> 00:02:02,840
nobody else think of looking
here. Oh, okay. Well, I won't,

28
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:06,080
I certainly won't divulge your address
or anything, but just don't tell him. No,

29
00:02:06,081 --> 00:02:08,960
of course I wouldn't, but that's in
California is all I'll say. Well,

30
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:11,630
where else would you want me to put it
in mind? But no, I don't know. I mean,

31
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,970
it's, uh, I imagined something like this,

32
00:02:13,971 --> 00:02:17,900
you would find it in the most started
for Leonard Hayflick about 50 years ago.

33
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:22,580
I got the back story actually not in
California. In Philly. I'll check.

34
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,370
Do you want to tell me where we are?

35
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:28,970
Where we're sitting on the 12th floor
of the William [inaudible] House in

36
00:02:28,971 --> 00:02:30,110
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,

37
00:02:30,111 --> 00:02:35,111
which happens to be my mother's apartment
who has just celebrated her hundredth

38
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:38,570
birthday. Just that day,
appropriately enough. In any case,

39
00:02:38,571 --> 00:02:43,160
let's rewind to the 50s biology was
facing a problem. Basic problem.

40
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,870
How do you study human
cells? Cells are us.

41
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:52,550
It is what we are, but you can't exactly
put a microscope up to your wrist.

42
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:55,670
I willing, you know, I guess you could,
but I wouldn't say it's impossible,

43
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,910
but it's certainly highly
impractical. What you can do instead,

44
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:03,170
and Hayflick was among the
first to perfect. This is, well,

45
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:03,960
he explained it to me.

46
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:08,960
If I take a tiny biopsy from any part
of your anatomy that you're willing to

47
00:03:09,361 --> 00:03:13,020
surrender to me, like say a fleck
of mine, like my wrist, your wrist,

48
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,930
kind of anywhere you want, the tip
of your nose and to be your toe,

49
00:03:15,931 --> 00:03:16,950
I don't care where it is.

50
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:22,070
And then you raise a pyramid of skin
by grabbing onto the tip of a hair,

51
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,453
pull it up.

52
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:28,520
And then with the other hand you'd take
a sterile scalpel and one little tip of

53
00:03:29,701 --> 00:03:31,200
that pyramid of skin off.

54
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:36,570
And I drop it into a test tube and I
introduce an enzyme preparation called

55
00:03:36,571 --> 00:03:39,870
trypsin. And that material dissolved.

56
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:44,000
It's the cement that holds
all the cells together.

57
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,940
Think of your tissue as a brick wall.

58
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,690
And once I dropped that
brick wall into my test tube,

59
00:03:50,691 --> 00:03:52,690
I need to dissolve the mortar. Right.

60
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:58,240
And now I have your individual cells
NFI feed them and treat them nicely.

61
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,140
They will divide

62
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:01,743
[inaudible].

63
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:04,090
Each cell produced two cells.

64
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,033
Hmm.

65
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,540
Each cell produced two cells

66
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:14,010
to sell to sell. Can you do the math?

67
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:17,460
You'll find that they'll cover the
city of New York and about three weeks.

68
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:21,590
I mean, you know, that's if you had
a big enough petri dish. In any case,

69
00:04:21,591 --> 00:04:24,140
this process, it's called cell culturing,

70
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:27,290
is the simplest thing in the
world these days. I mean,

71
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:31,610
modern biologists can do it with their
eyes close the back in Hayflick's Day in

72
00:04:31,611 --> 00:04:36,320
the fifties it was very fuzzy because no
one really understood the mechanics of

73
00:04:36,321 --> 00:04:39,710
it. No one knew exactly what a
cell liked or what it didn't like.

74
00:04:39,711 --> 00:04:43,380
And so the people that were really good
at getting the cells to divide from two

75
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,920
and a four and eight and 16 whatever.
Yes, they, it was like they had the touch.

76
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:52,910
They had what was called a green thumb.
There was a mystique about them because,

77
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:56,210
you know, don't forget, this
was the early days biology. No,

78
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,870
biology at that time was
still kind of a black art.

79
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:01,511
Well,

80
00:05:01,511 --> 00:05:05,800
I'm interested in the use of the term
black art because that attribute was given

81
00:05:05,801 --> 00:05:10,801
to the field by a single individual who
dominated the field for about 20 or 30

82
00:05:10,991 --> 00:05:12,910
years. His name was Alexis corral.

83
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:19,700
He believed that the contamination of
tissue cultures with airborne bacteria

84
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:25,790
could be eliminated or prevented by
maintaining sterile circumstances.

85
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:30,690
That in his mind included
everything being painted black

86
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,400
[inaudible].

87
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,070
No, don't ask me the rationale for
that because I can't explain it.

88
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,970
It's so gothic. I love it. Exactly.

89
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:42,640
All of his technicians on he himself
were dressed from head to foot and black,

90
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:47,970
and he had a gallery around the lab
where reporters could wander to see these

91
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:53,431
mystical black figures roaming
the laboratory and keep
lore doing strange things

92
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:57,980
with strange implements and ending up

93
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,040
with cells growing. It must've
seemed like wishcraft on.

94
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:04,010
It didn't seem like they
believed it was witchcraft,

95
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:09,130
especially because Alexis corral claimed
to have kept a chick heart alive for 46

96
00:06:12,531 --> 00:06:16,370
years at chick heart. Yes. Like
the heart of a baby chicken.

97
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:21,290
It was a fragment of tissue from
the chick heart. So for 46 years,

98
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:24,740
the cells divided and divided every
couple of days. That's what was alleged.

99
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,640
Now, 46 years is a long time. Right.

100
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,280
And so scientists thought that
if they've gone this long,

101
00:06:31,281 --> 00:06:33,080
they'll probably go forever

102
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,730
because of corral. And a
couple of other scientists,

103
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,200
they always thought that cells are
immortal under the proper conditions,

104
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:46,760
the grow and definitely and Carell's
little chicken heart seemed to be proof of

105
00:06:46,761 --> 00:06:49,820
this. It just kept spewing new cells,

106
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:54,470
which he'd keep dividing into new bottles.
It was the New York Post said quote,

107
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:59,630
if all of the cells produced
by Dr Carel from his culture,

108
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:02,180
chicken heart were kept together,

109
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,720
they would produce a rooster that could
cross the Atlantic Ocean in a single

110
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:08,650
sheet.

111
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:09,483
Yeah.

112
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,190
Boy, I wish I'd come up
with that myself now.

113
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:21,950
Or was that a quote that was made lovingly
or admiringly or was that a sort of

114
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:25,550
sneer made to sell the New York
Post? It did. People bought it,

115
00:07:25,551 --> 00:07:27,440
I guess is what I'm
asking. You're darn right.

116
00:07:27,441 --> 00:07:29,890
They bought it until it was torpedo.

117
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,133
Yeah,

118
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:36,540
right. Well that's the story
that I want to get to next.

119
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,220
It happened by accident.

120
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:43,200
You did not set out to torpedo the
rooster or the whole idea of cellular

121
00:07:43,201 --> 00:07:45,810
immortality. It just kinda
happened. He was in the lab.

122
00:07:45,811 --> 00:07:49,140
It was the 50s he was just a
kid and he becomes worried.

123
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:54,180
This was an ordinary worry at the time
that his little cells would become

124
00:07:54,181 --> 00:07:54,870
contaminated.

125
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:59,870
I knew at the time that if you cultured
normal human tissue from adults,

126
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:06,110
you might grow simultaneously unwanted
viruses because in adults the viruses

127
00:08:06,121 --> 00:08:09,930
would sometimes sneak into the cells
and hide there. And I didn't want,

128
00:08:09,931 --> 00:08:12,750
of course, my culture is to be
contaminated with these viruses.

129
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,480
So I zeroed in on human fetal tissue,

130
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:19,500
human fetal tissue as in from abortions,

131
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,490
sorry to ask an ignorant question,
but it w abortion at that time was,

132
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:28,870
was it anything like the crazy political
thornbush that is now no farm or

133
00:08:29,401 --> 00:08:31,200
rational? It was actually quite easy.

134
00:08:31,201 --> 00:08:34,260
He says he just picked up the phone and
called my friends at the University of

135
00:08:34,261 --> 00:08:38,160
Pennsylvania and said I want wanted
fetuses whenever they were surgically

136
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:39,210
boarded.

137
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:43,860
And as you might expect when you put
your order in for a fetal tissue,

138
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,500
you know, not when the phone will ring.

139
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,930
He never knew when the
shipments would arrive.

140
00:08:48,931 --> 00:08:53,780
I would receive maybe one fetus one week
and then two weeks later, another one.

141
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:58,230
So to keep track of, and this
turns out to be key. He kept a log.

142
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,120
Every time he'd get a new shipment,

143
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:04,930
he would jot down the arrival day and
then dropped the cells into the flask and

144
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:07,080
Washington divine, do you all deal.

145
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:12,081
And then every couple of weeks he would
come check on them and that's when it

146
00:09:12,421 --> 00:09:16,350
started. I began to realize that
some of the cultures are unhappy.

147
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:20,640
The stop divided. At first
it was just one, one batch.

148
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,150
What were you thinking at this point? Uh,

149
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,380
I didn't know what to say cause it's
just an observation and it was just one

150
00:09:25,381 --> 00:09:29,700
batch batch a, let's call it yet. All
right, no biggie. We'll see how it goes.

151
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:34,840
Let's come back a and a month later I
find out that not only ey is still not

152
00:09:36,471 --> 00:09:39,140
doing its thing, but
B and c aren't either.

153
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:43,630
No three batches of cells had
gone. Caput said to myself,

154
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:44,980
well that's peculiar.

155
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:48,070
Peculiar because here he'd done the same
with these cells as he'd done with all

156
00:09:48,071 --> 00:09:52,150
the others, put them in the same
glasses, same solution, same conditions,

157
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,910
didn't add up. Now I have to
find out what the cause is.

158
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,470
So I'll go back and look at my records.

159
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,353
Sure.

160
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:00,710
And that is when it
smacks him in the face.

161
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:02,380
What

162
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,870
the thing that all three
batches of sales hadn't come in,

163
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:09,760
and he knew this because he'd kept
the logs, is that they were the oldest

164
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:12,310
[inaudible],

165
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:13,143
so to speak.

166
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,870
He'd received each batch of fetal tissue
from the hospital received from the

167
00:10:16,871 --> 00:10:21,760
hospital roughly nine months ago.
At nine months or thereabouts.

168
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,550
They just kind of hit a wall
and they stopped divide.

169
00:10:25,551 --> 00:10:28,370
But the ones received one month,
two or three, one for them.

170
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,080
Upon the six months ago though sales
were doing just fine. Perfect, beautiful.

171
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:36,190
And he kept seeing this simultaneously.

172
00:10:36,191 --> 00:10:40,750
Two thoughts enter his mind thought
number one, this can't be an accident.

173
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:44,790
If it was a accident, it should
be rand thought number two.

174
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:46,081
Wait a second.

175
00:10:46,081 --> 00:10:50,100
This has to be an accident because
I hadn't been taught by experts.

176
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:53,730
It's cells are, they will grow forever.

177
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:56,380
Okay. All right. Fast
forward a few months.

178
00:10:56,381 --> 00:10:59,890
Those two conflicting thoughts are still
fighting it out in Hayflick's mind.

179
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:03,010
Along comes the annual biology

180
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,340
for the biggest scientific
meeting in the world.

181
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:08,370
That time the meeting was
held in Atlantic city.

182
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:11,860
Hayflick and a few friends decide to
hop in a car and crashed the meeting

183
00:11:11,861 --> 00:11:13,600
because the featured speaker was a guy.

184
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,630
Hey flick really admired
guy by the name of Ted puck

185
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:20,780
because I want to hear what he has to
say and I'm gonna if I can get enough

186
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:22,350
guts, I'm going to ask him a question.

187
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,430
I remember distinctly it was
a big whole house and people,

188
00:11:28,431 --> 00:11:29,750
I'm sure it's exaggeration,

189
00:11:29,751 --> 00:11:34,670
but huge are lots of people and I'm
somewhere in a little listening to this

190
00:11:34,671 --> 00:11:34,911
talk.

191
00:11:34,911 --> 00:11:39,911
You see the match previously developed
whereby single cells and at the end as is

192
00:11:40,641 --> 00:11:43,250
customary, asked for question.
Are there any questions?

193
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,950
I timidly raised my hand.

194
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:49,440
So yes. The young fellow
was sent to you. Yes.

195
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:54,160
And I asked him the following
question, Dr Puck, have you ever

196
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,600
found that the cells that
you culture stop dividing?

197
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:03,520
Did you want to give him a kind of that?
Gotcha. What were you thinking? I want,

198
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:07,690
I was ready to publish. I wanted
to know whether I'm in trouble,

199
00:12:07,691 --> 00:12:12,691
whether I have an artifact on my hands
that nobody has seen because they do it

200
00:12:13,181 --> 00:12:16,540
right. I see. I'm still worried. Got It.

201
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:22,660
And so he says he looks at me, you
know, like in the video we'll of course

202
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:24,740
the cell stop dividing occasionally.

203
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:27,800
Of course I lose myself occasionally,

204
00:12:27,801 --> 00:12:31,670
but I simply go back to the
freezer and reconstitute it.

205
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:34,700
Meaning that when the cells stop
dividing, which he just had been in,

206
00:12:34,701 --> 00:12:38,510
they do all the time. He just said, Eh,
something happened. I don't know what.

207
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:41,160
I'll just go back to the freezer
and get, well that's not right.

208
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:43,530
Because if they stopped dividing,
they might've just died.

209
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,740
It's not that he was cheating, it's
that he thought he had screwed up.

210
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,800
Oh, then I know it was a Gotcha.

211
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:51,640
Well, he didn't yell. Gotcha. Right
at that moment, he just sat back down.

212
00:12:51,641 --> 00:12:56,641
But now he knew it was real because even
the brilliant Ted puck had seen it too,

213
00:12:56,801 --> 00:12:58,900
but like everyone else
for the past 60 years,

214
00:12:58,901 --> 00:13:03,520
he just hadn't recognized
it for what it was.

215
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:06,610
I imagine in labs all over the country,

216
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:11,710
there must've been a lot of moments when
cells stop dividing and at every one of

217
00:13:11,711 --> 00:13:15,040
those moments you're saying the thought
that popped into the technician's mind

218
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:15,874
is

219
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,390
Yup, absolutely.

220
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:21,720
That seems like a crazy
kind of mass delusion.

221
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:25,740
It's called dog Gerry. Another
definition of the word dog.

222
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:27,600
I've heard that word before. That's it.

223
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:32,610
The concept of mortality was
absent from people's minds.

224
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:36,120
Well, wait, if they didn't
understand the idea of mortality,

225
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:40,200
then how did they scientists exploring
getting older and moving towards death

226
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:41,970
for pre torpedoing? Yeah.

227
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,810
Radiation. What? Radiation?

228
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,330
Well, what do you mean? No, seriously?

229
00:13:48,331 --> 00:13:51,450
I mean it was this idea that like
stuff is happening outside the cell,

230
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,610
that the radiation is bombarding the cell,

231
00:13:53,611 --> 00:13:56,030
like gamma rays and Alpha rays
and these kinds of things. Okay.

232
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,080
And then that somehow ages the cell.

233
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:02,100
So the trigger is outside the being
not inside this owl in, right.

234
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:07,440
My discovery and I pointed it out that
first paper was to indicate that it's in

235
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:11,110
the cell, not outside the cell.
That's where the action is.

236
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:14,100
Hayflick argued that
somewhere in the cell there,

237
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:16,560
there's a counter one too.

238
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:21,700
There's gotta be for something on sale
is the keeping track eight nine 10 11

239
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:25,140
because after about nine months
of happy dividing in a petri dish,

240
00:14:25,141 --> 00:14:29,370
when the cell gets to 50 divisions,
sometimes the few takes more.

241
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:33,720
If you takes less than 50 is the
average and when it reaches 54 45 little

242
00:14:33,721 --> 00:14:38,480
counter inside cell 49 50 says, ah,

243
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,950
50 is the magic number. Where
did this number 50 come from?

244
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,910
Ah, you'll have to ask God that question

245
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:45,981
nonetheless.

246
00:14:45,981 --> 00:14:50,981
Hayflick not God has his name forever
attached to that number because it's known

247
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:53,450
as the Hayflick limit.

248
00:14:58,530 --> 00:14:59,350
[inaudible].

249
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:02,530
Now, one of the interesting
things hatefully told me
while we looked at a secret

250
00:15:02,531 --> 00:15:07,090
stash of fetal cells in his garage is
that there is a way to tinker with the

251
00:15:07,091 --> 00:15:10,270
cellular counter. If you
lower the temperature by say,

252
00:15:10,271 --> 00:15:15,190
putting the sales in liquid nitrogen as
he has the dividing one will get slower

253
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,920
and slower and slower.

254
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,990
I don't know

255
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,270
until it stops at 250 degrees below zero,

256
00:15:24,271 --> 00:15:27,780
the cells will not divide
and they won't die.

257
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:32,820
They'll just wait for as
long as you keep them frozen.

258
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,620
The sales I have in my freezer,

259
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:39,690
I've been frozen for 44 years,

260
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,460
is that make them long.

261
00:15:41,461 --> 00:15:46,461
These cells are the longest frozen
normal human cells in the world.

262
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:50,220
The fetal cells these
talking about incidentally,

263
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,950
are the ones that he use to
discover the Hayflick limit.

264
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:56,940
He calls it WWI 38 what do we know

265
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:03,500
about the mother of the fetus that
created WWI 38 she was a Swedish woman and

266
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:11,091
she wanted an abortion because she
had many children and was very poor.

267
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,830
Her husband was not a good father and uh,

268
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,740
that's where this tissue
came from. Here's the kicker.

269
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:22,770
After the Hayflick limit
experiments, these cells,

270
00:16:22,771 --> 00:16:26,880
this particular strain was used
to incubate and produce vaccines,

271
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:32,310
all different kinds. Polio,
German, measles, measles, mumps,

272
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,600
rabies,

273
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:38,640
and anybody born in the last 50 years
who's had any of these vaccines has had

274
00:16:38,641 --> 00:16:40,300
these cells in their body.

275
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:45,330
The numbers of people who have benefited
from these vaccines now exceed 1

276
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:49,350
billion people. That's billion
with a B billion with a B.

277
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:50,670
Wow.

278
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:55,670
One aborted child creates a fleet of
cells that vaccinate a billion people.

279
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,350
Think about that for a second.

280
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:06,320
And is it true that that you have a
cell and from, is it your daughter? Yes.

281
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:10,550
I also have cells in there from the
amnion of my daughters, Susan Hayflick.

282
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:13,220
Do you keep them for purely scientific
reasons or is it sort of like stamp

283
00:17:13,221 --> 00:17:14,980
collecting? You have them. Oh,

284
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:20,010
well it would be is a scientist now
herself and so I'll probably give the

285
00:17:20,151 --> 00:17:23,150
ampules to her so she can do it
with a monk. She what she wishes.

286
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:27,080
But You keep them because it's your
daughter mostly? Yes. Mostly. Yeah, sure.

287
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:31,670
Yeah. That's really sweet. Here's the
interesting thing. Scientifically,

288
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,910
if you were to warm these
cells up, give them some food,

289
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:36,590
alright.

290
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:39,660
They'd start to divide again,
five six and not only that,

291
00:17:39,661 --> 00:17:43,950
they pick up right where they left off.
Oh. And even if you froze them again,

292
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:49,110
30 the 1615 doubling 16
and kept them that way,

293
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:54,380
a thousand million years wouldn't matter
because as soon as you unfroze them

294
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,140
off,

295
00:17:55,140 --> 00:18:00,140
they'd go 1718 1920 on their way
to 52 23 without missing a beat.

296
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:04,760
What does that tell you?
Tells you that the cells,

297
00:18:04,761 --> 00:18:06,920
remember they have a memory.

298
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:11,880
Somehow the cell always remembers
where it is in the count to 50 oh,

299
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,840
the cells can't count. How
did they do that? Oh, that's,

300
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:16,040
and that was the next big question.

301
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:19,430
So we set about to do a number
of experiments. However,

302
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:24,431
the next big breakthrough came in 1971
and not by Hayflick while he was doing

303
00:18:24,951 --> 00:18:29,120
his experiments in Philly, halfway
across the world, the very same moment,

304
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,200
a Russian name,

305
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:33,800
Alexia Lubna cof was attending a
lecture to lecture in the house.

306
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:37,460
He flicks research and he left that
lecture puzzled by this question that you

307
00:18:37,461 --> 00:18:41,570
asked. How do the cells remember? And
when he, have you ever been in Moscow?

308
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:42,670
Hmm. Well.

309
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:44,890
Anyhow, so he ended the
Moscow subway station,

310
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:49,720
went down to the railroad platform,
and suddenly he had an insight.

311
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:53,140
He had a brilliant insight. When
he lifted the railroad track,

312
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:57,610
the first thing you thought was
those tracks look a lot like DNA.

313
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,590
If you take real attraction,
you tuition, you got DNA. Okay,

314
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,270
say it some DNA and that DNA job
is to count to 50 and then yellow

315
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:05,760
[inaudible].

316
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,690
Well, we know part of the DNA has the
job of yelling, but the other stuff,

317
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:14,100
the rest of it, what if it's
just a long sequence of nonsense?

318
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:18,440
Nonsense. What if every time that
cellular copier comes along to cut

319
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:23,360
you, you sell it, you lose
one little piece of it.

320
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,440
The nonsense. Well,

321
00:19:25,441 --> 00:19:30,441
if you had seen 50 pieces of nonsense
as a buffer around the cents part,

322
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:31,380
the switch,

323
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:36,150
well then it would take 50 copies to
snit away all the nonsense until you left

324
00:19:36,151 --> 00:19:39,020
with the switch, which
would turn on entail.

325
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:40,323
Listen to stop divine

326
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,720
back in Philadelphia. As we were
wrapping up that first interview,

327
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:52,340
a question occurred to me. If we kind
of understand how that off switch works,

328
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:55,190
shouldn't we theoretically
be able to take her out?

329
00:19:55,191 --> 00:19:58,580
How to tinker with when the
switch gets switched? In theory,

330
00:19:58,581 --> 00:19:59,870
I suppose you could. Yeah, sure.

331
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:04,400
And within that allow us to have
a longer amount of cell divisions.

332
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:09,020
Well that certainly it doesn't violate
any knowledge about the system of course.

333
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:11,900
And wouldn't that theoretically
give us something,

334
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:17,270
whether it be extended life
or something? Yes, certainly.

335
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:21,470
Hey, flickered clearly been asked this
question a million times and he patiently

336
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:25,760
explained to me that there is a way right
now that we can tinker with the timing

337
00:20:25,761 --> 00:20:29,900
of the switch. You take an enzyme
called telomerase, telomerase,

338
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:34,070
throw it into the mix and every time
that cell gets copied and loses pieces of

339
00:20:34,071 --> 00:20:34,371
track,

340
00:20:34,371 --> 00:20:39,371
the telomerase enzyme comes along and
adds and back on [inaudible] and maintains

341
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:42,830
the length constant. That
way the track is always long.

342
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,760
The stop switch never gets switched
and the cell can keep going,

343
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:50,070
going and going. That's
how they become a mortal.

344
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:54,480
So you're not going to tell me, well,
let's inoculate everybody with Tom Rice.

345
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:58,710
Yeah. And, well, if you volunteer,
we'll have a shot at it.

346
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:02,100
Are you ready there? There must be. If
I were to go out and shout from you,

347
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,130
how can you right here,

348
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:06,780
get a hundred people who would want to
try only not after. I tell you what,

349
00:21:06,781 --> 00:21:09,000
you still don't know. What's that?

350
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:14,300
95% of all tumors contain telomerase,

351
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:19,820
which normal cells do not contain the
single most distinguishing criteria

352
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,860
between normal and cancer cells. No,

353
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:27,840
today is that fact.

354
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:33,070
So the tradeoff for cellular immortality,
at least in this case, is cancer.

355
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,250
But here's the weird
thing. If you look around,

356
00:21:36,251 --> 00:21:40,570
you will see that our Hayflick
limit of 50 is not the only one.

357
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:45,780
We do know that if you look at the
normal cells of a Galapagos tortoise,

358
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,780
which has been reported
in the literature, uh,

359
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:52,810
they undergo about 125 doublings,
if I remember correctly.

360
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:57,970
So their Hayflick number is one 25
and ours is 50, apparently. Yes.

361
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:02,320
Does that correlate to the, the Galapagos
turtle living twice as long? Well,

362
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:06,070
it's the same. It seems too, but
that comparison may be anecdotal.

363
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,340
I'm not universal. That's what
Hayflick is up to these days.

364
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:12,880
He's become fascinated by animals
who age differently than us,

365
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:15,460
who might have a doubling
limit of, you know,

366
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:19,090
200 500 or no limit at all.

367
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:23,860
There are the whole class of animals
that don't age will get like what the

368
00:22:23,861 --> 00:22:28,861
American lobster lobster
doesn't age either does not
age or the rate is so slow.

369
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:36,370
We can't measure it. I don't even know
how to imagine that. What does that mean?

370
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:39,370
That it does? What it means is that
the animal gets bigger and bigger,

371
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:44,050
which is growth. Yes. There are
lobsters that have been found.

372
00:22:44,051 --> 00:22:47,110
I are recently, I read about
one of those over 50 pounds.

373
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,013
Hm.

374
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,380
I looked it up. The largest lobster
ever reported was close to yes.

375
00:22:55,381 --> 00:23:00,381
50 pounds found in the 1950s
just off the coast of New Jersey.

376
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:04,770
New Jersey. Yeah. Hi, Ho fit.
How old is a 50 pound lobster?

377
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:08,480
Who known vacation was wearing a
Grover Cleveland for president button.

378
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:10,320
So y'all, I'm Jad,

379
00:23:10,321 --> 00:23:12,960
I've been riding I prequel
[inaudible] this is radio lab will be.
