have been the goal because now they

00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:57.360
have been the goal because now they
 

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.820
have been the goal because now they
could make a Cloverfield movie out of

00:08:58.820 --> 00:08:58.830

and so many different universes and

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:02.280
and so many different universes and
 

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:04.310
and so many different universes and
event and dimensions that they could do

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:04.320
event and dimensions that they could do
 

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.320
event and dimensions that they could do
anything now which I guess might have

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:06.330
anything now which I guess might have
 

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:07.880
anything now which I guess might have
been what they were trying to do but

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:07.890
been what they were trying to do but
 

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:09.260
been what they were trying to do but
