00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.210
And there again several possible solutions here, but the maximum number of items that Carol can select

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.130
is at most 3 and I'll give you one example of this.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:18.060
For example, she could decide to invest in the manufacturer,

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.310
which means that she cannot invest in this mining company here.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:29.270
Then she could maybe decide to also invest in this bank, which means she cannot invest

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.940
in this mining company here, and then she could also choose one of those methods here.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.630
Let's say she also decides that she is going to invest in silver,

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.750
but that means that copper and gold are out of the question.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.170
Again, she could have also chosen one of the other possibilities here,

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.850
but three is really the maximum number of items that she can select.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.210
Similar to the problem that Bob was working on, this is of course a bit of a simplification,

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.900
so when you're working on real work finance problems, you usually have constraints

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.730
that are a bit more complicate and also of course, your networks will be much larger,

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.570
but in essence that's a sort of problem that you might encounter in

00:01:10.570 --> 99:59:59.000
financial modeling and optimization--only a simplified version of it.
