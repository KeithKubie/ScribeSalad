00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.909
If you were to rank plants, whales, and humans
based on their intelligence - who would win

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:11.930
the Most Intelligent Species on Earth Award?

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.840
One of the biggest questions humans have ever
asked is: Are we alone in the universe?

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.430
There’s a field of science dedicated to
this question known as the Search for Extraterrestrial

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.720
Intelligence - or SETI.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.689
In order for SETI scientists to do their job
they had to agree on what makes certain life

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.269
Intelligent, so they’d know what to look
for.

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:33.390
SETI scientists came to the consensus that
intelligence is associated with the ability

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.320
to create technology.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.070
Some of our best technologies emit radio waves
and so SETI has concentrated their work on

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.100
searching for radio waves in the universe.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.930
But if we’re only searching for life like
us, we may be overlooking species that are

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.000
intelligent in other ways.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.530
There are many different types of intelligent
life on our own planet.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.739
For example, plants.

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:58.230
That may sound ridiculous, but if you grade
intelligence based on a species’ communication

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.430
system and their ability to populate a planet,
plants would be considered by many scientists

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.180
as an intelligent species.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.009
Charles Darwin - who passionately studied
plants for most of his life - thought of them

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:12.889
like upside-down animals where their thinking
organ was at the root and their sexual organs

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:14.040
were on top.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.700
And - he may have been more right than he
realized.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.159
Recent studies have shown that plant roots
not only have the ability to sense soil characteristics

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:26.409
like water, nutrients, and the availability
of oxygen, but they also change their behavior

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:27.759
based on this information.

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:33.219
Instead of just one big brain - or root - most
plants have millions of individual roots,

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:38.490
each working together like a complex network
- no one root necessary to survive.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.729
Because of this, plants have a remarkable
ability to survive catastrophic events.

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.569
Trees, for example, can live on even after
losing 90% or more of their roots.

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:51.469
With this unique ability, it’s no wonder
why plants dominate animals on land with more

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:54.759
than 1,000 times the amount of biomass.

00:01:54.759 --> 00:02:00.289
So - if world domination was a numbers game,
plants would beat animals a thousand to one.

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:04.430
But animals eat plants so maybe there’s
more to intelligence.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.009
Like brains, right?

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:08.229
Humans are known for their uniquely large
brains.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.850
To compare this to other species, scientists
came up with something called the Encephalization

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.290
Quotient, or EQ.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.750
An EQ for a given species is calculated using
their average brain to body mass ratio compared

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.599
to other similarly sized animals.

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.099
It’s thought of as sort of a proxy for intelligence.

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:30.319
On the higher end, humans have an EQ of around
7.8 - which means our brain is about 7.8 times

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:36.409
larger than would be expected for our body
size - the bottlenose dolphin is at 5.3, chimpanzees

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:40.200
are at 2.5, and dogs are around 1.2.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.740
And what about whales?

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.569
Whales are considered to be reasonably intelligent
And certain species like the Sperm Whale the

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:48.989
heaviest brains in the animal kingdom.

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:55.530
But interestingly, the sperm whale has a measly
EQ of 0.58That’s because the EQ equation

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.599
doesn’t work as well for animals that are
extremely large or extremely small.

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:03.549
To get a more accurate understanding of whale’s
intelligence - we’d have to compare how

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.100
complex different species’ communication
systems are.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.780
Humans are thought to dominate the animal
kingdom in this category, but whales may not

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.390
be that far behind.

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.030
Humpback whales, for instance, are known for
their remarkably complex songs - their mating

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.140
calls, for example, are the most complex acoustic
displays in the entire animal kingdom.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.019
And interestly enough, a recent study suggests
that prairie dogs may have a communication

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:29.499
system that’s even more complex than whales.

00:03:29.499 --> 00:03:33.420
One researcher who studied the prairie dog
for three decades found that their calls contained

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.379
different barks, squeals, squeaks,and frequency
modulations, and each animal called out in

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:39.819
unique tones.

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:43.639
The prairie dogs had different calls for different
predators and the same “words” could be

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:45.959
understood by all the members of the colony.

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:50.840
The universe just may be filled with intelligent
prairie dogs, whales, and plants -andddd we’d

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:51.939
never know it.

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:56.840
SETI couldn’t find them because they don’t
create radiowave emitting technology.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.920
But maybe in the future we’ll think of a
better way to search for all possible forms

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.170
of intelligent life... for now we’ll have
to stick to the kinds of aliens that act like

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.170
us.

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.840

size matters, check out this video here.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.129
What about you?

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:13.260
How would you define intelligent life?
