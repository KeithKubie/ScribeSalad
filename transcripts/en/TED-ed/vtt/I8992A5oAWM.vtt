00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.474
More than a century after first emerging

00:00:10.474 --> 00:00:14.500
into the fog-bound,
gas-lit streets of Victorian London,

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.231
Sherlock Holmes 
is universally recognizable.

00:00:18.231 --> 00:00:21.483
Even his wardrobe and accessories
are iconic:

00:00:21.483 --> 00:00:22.998
the Inverness cape,

00:00:22.998 --> 00:00:24.445
deerstalker hat,

00:00:24.445 --> 00:00:26.250
and calabash pipe,

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.725
and figures such as his best friend
and housemate Doctor Watson,

00:00:29.725 --> 00:00:31.785
arch-nemesis Moriarty,

00:00:31.785 --> 00:00:33.974
and housekeeper Mrs. Hudson

00:00:33.974 --> 00:00:37.161
have become part of the popular
consciousness,

00:00:37.161 --> 00:00:40.860
as have his extraordinary,
infallible powers of deduction

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.959
utilized in the name of the law,

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:44.660
his notorious drug use,

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.230
and his popular catchphrase,
"Elementary, my dear Watson."

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.420
And yet many of these most recognizable
features of Holmes

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.155
don't appear in Arthur Conan Doyle's
original stories.

00:00:56.155 --> 00:01:00.499
Doyle's great detective solves
crimes in all sorts of ways,

00:01:00.499 --> 00:01:02.240
not just using deduction.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:08.162
He speculates, and at times even guesses,
and regularly makes false assumptions.

00:01:08.162 --> 00:01:10.901
Furthermore, Mrs. Hudson 
is barely mentioned,

00:01:10.901 --> 00:01:13.823
no one says, "Elementary, my dear Watson,"

00:01:13.823 --> 00:01:18.208
and the detective and his sidekick
live apart for much of the time.

00:01:18.208 --> 00:01:21.707
Moriarty, the grand villain, 
only appears in two stories,

00:01:21.707 --> 00:01:25.508
the detective's drug use is infrequent
after the first two novels,

00:01:25.508 --> 00:01:29.309
and Holmes is rarely enthralled
to the English legal system;

00:01:29.309 --> 00:01:32.944
He much prefers enacting his own form
of natural justice

00:01:32.944 --> 00:01:35.261
to sticking to the letter of the law.

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:38.607
Finally, many of the most iconic elements
of the Holmesian legend

00:01:38.607 --> 00:01:40.444
aren't Doyle's either.

00:01:40.444 --> 00:01:44.500
The deerstalker cap and cape
were first imagined by Sidney Paget,

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.042
the story's initial illustrator.

00:01:47.042 --> 00:01:51.195
the curved pipe was chosen by
American actor William Gillette

00:01:51.195 --> 00:01:55.094
so that audiences could more clearly see
his face on stage,

00:01:55.094 --> 00:01:57.605
and the phrase, 
"Elementary, my dear Watson,"

00:01:57.605 --> 00:02:01.722
was coined by author and humorist
P.G. Wodehouse.

00:02:01.722 --> 00:02:04.487
So who exactly is Sherlock Holmes?

00:02:04.487 --> 00:02:07.771
Who's the real great detective,
and where do we find him?

00:02:07.771 --> 00:02:10.356
Purists might answer 
that the original Sherlock

00:02:10.356 --> 00:02:15.593
inspired by Arthur Conan Doyle's 
university mentor Dr. Joseph Bell

00:02:15.593 --> 00:02:17.011
is the real one.

00:02:17.011 --> 00:02:21.768
But the fact remains that that version
of Sherlock has been largely eclipsed

00:02:21.768 --> 00:02:24.477
by the sheer volume of interpretation,

00:02:24.477 --> 00:02:28.048
leaving Doyle's detective 
largely unrecognizable.

00:02:28.048 --> 00:02:29.958
So there's another, more complex,

00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:33.169
but perhaps more satisfying
answer to the question,

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:37.353
but to get there, we must first consider
the vast body of interpretations

00:02:37.353 --> 00:02:39.159
of the great detective.

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:42.537
Since Conan Doyle's first story in 1887,

00:02:42.537 --> 00:02:45.825
there have been thousands 
of adaptations of Holmes,

00:02:45.825 --> 00:02:50.939
making him perhaps the most adapted
fictional character in the world.

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:54.319
That process began with Victorian
stage adaptations,

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:57.083
and accelerated 
with the emergence of film.

00:02:57.083 --> 00:03:00.303
There were more than 100 film adaptations
of Holmes

00:03:00.303 --> 00:03:03.784
in the first two decades 
of the 20th century alone.

00:03:03.784 --> 00:03:07.097
And since then, there have many thousands
more in print,

00:03:07.097 --> 00:03:08.190
and on film,

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.063
television,

00:03:09.063 --> 00:03:09.842
stage,

00:03:09.842 --> 00:03:10.997
and radio.

00:03:10.997 --> 00:03:13.727
Holmes has been reinterpreted
by people everywhere,

00:03:13.727 --> 00:03:17.203
in remarkably different,
and often contradictory ways.

00:03:17.203 --> 00:03:20.587
These adaptations demonstrate
both Holmes's popularity

00:03:20.587 --> 00:03:22.746
and his malleability.

00:03:22.746 --> 00:03:27.569
For instance, he featured in a number
of allied anti-Nazi propaganda films

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:29.311
during World War II.

00:03:29.311 --> 00:03:32.074
And both Winston Churchill
and Franklin Delano Roosevelt

00:03:32.074 --> 00:03:34.134
were avid enthusiasts,

00:03:34.134 --> 00:03:37.586
the latter even joining 
the Baker Street Irregulars,

00:03:37.586 --> 00:03:39.997
a Holmesian appreciation society,

00:03:39.997 --> 00:03:43.567
and nicknaming one secret service
hideout Baker Street.

00:03:43.567 --> 00:03:45.397
And yet, at the very same time,

00:03:45.397 --> 00:03:49.399
Holmes also appeared in various
German-language film adaptations,

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:54.385
some of which were said to have been
much-loved favorites of Adolf Hitler.

00:03:54.385 --> 00:03:56.058
So let's return to our question.

00:03:56.058 --> 00:03:59.185
Would the real Sherlock Holmes
please stand up?

00:03:59.185 --> 00:04:03.910
The truth is that this world of adaptation
has made him into a palimpsest.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.005
Sherlock is a cultural text,

00:04:06.005 --> 00:04:11.382
repeatedly altered over time as each new
interpretation becomes superimposed

00:04:11.382 --> 00:04:13.601
over those that proceed it.

00:04:13.601 --> 00:04:16.369
This means that Sherlock 
continually evolves,

00:04:16.369 --> 00:04:20.323
embodying ideas and values 
often far removed

00:04:20.323 --> 00:04:22.521
from those found in Conan Doyle.

00:04:22.521 --> 00:04:26.931
And after each particular story ends,
Sherlock rises again,

00:04:26.931 --> 00:04:28.760
a little changed, perhaps,

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.626
with a new face and fresh mannerisms
or turns of phrase,

00:04:32.626 --> 00:04:36.192
but still essentially Sherlock,
our Sherlock.
