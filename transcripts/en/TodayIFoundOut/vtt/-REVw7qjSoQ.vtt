00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:14.880
The Difference Between Hardwoods and Softwoods

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.070
Generally speaking, wood is often put into
one of two categories- hardwood and softwood.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.180
But what exactly makes a given piece of wood
qualify as either hard or soft and how did

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:26.900
those definitions come about?

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.310
Perhaps the most important and misunderstood
aspect of defining wood as either hard or

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:37.840
soft is that it has absolutely nothing to
do with the individual qualities of the harvested

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.000
wood itself.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The most famous and oft used example of this
concept is that of balsa wood which, despite

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.350
being literally one of the least dense (and
hence softest) woods of all, is technically

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.140
classified as hardwood.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.850
Likewise, the wood of the yew tree, which
is classified as being a softwood, is a great

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.270
deal tougher than many hardwoods including
several types of oak.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.030
So what’s going on here?

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.040
Well, the basic answer is that classifying
a wood as either hard or soft is entirely

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.780
dependent on the seeds produced by the tree
it comes from.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.060
If a tree’s seeds have some sort of covering
when they fall from the tree, be it in the

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.040
form of a shell or fruit, then the wood of
that tree will be classified as hardwood.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.340
On the other hand, if a tree produces seeds
that are simply left to the elements when

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.600
they fall to the ground, then the wood harvested
from it will be classified as a softwood.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.719
The technical term for a tree that produces
seeds sans any sort of covering is “gymnosperm”,

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:40.119
a term derived from Ancient Greek which literally
translates to “naked seed“.

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.560
In regards the trees that produce covered
seeds, the technical term is “angiosperm”,

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.549
a word that is again taken from Ancient Greek
and roughly translates to “vessel seed”

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:53.319
or more aptly, “seeds contained in a protective
vessel”.

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:58.499
As previously mentioned, angiosperms include
any tree that produces fruit as well as any

00:01:58.499 --> 00:02:03.509
tree that produces seeds protected by some
sort of shell, like an acorn.

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.849
According to The Dawn Angiosperms, by Xin
Wang, the term “angiosperm” was first

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:13.750
coined way back in 1690 by a German botanist,
Paul Hermann, who coined it as a way of classifying

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.310
members of the plant kingdom by the one thing
they all had in common- seeds.

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.870
Although the terms hardwood and softwood are
in no way related to the relative toughness

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.280
of a given piece of wood, it’s noted that,
for the most part, hardwoods are usually harder

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.710
than softwoods.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:35.770
This leaves the obvious question of how exactly
one classifies how hard a piece of wood is?

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.890
The most common way is using something known
as the Janka Hardness Test, which has been

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.520
an industry standard since 1906.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.360
This involves measuring the average amount
of force required to “embed a .444-inch

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.620
steel ball to half its diameter” in some
type of wood, with the average used so that

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.730
the difference in hardness between heartwood
and “live edge” wood doesn’t skew things

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:58.730
too much.

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.330
It is also distinguished via “side hardness”
and “end hardness” (whether this test

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.410
was done on the surface of a plank (side)
or on the cut surface (surface of the stump),

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:09.790
which is “end hardness”.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.590
Most of the time, the numbers you’ll see
quoted here are referring to side hardness.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.090
The Janka test itself it the brainchild of
one Gabriel Janka who came up with it after

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.660
being asked by the Department of Agriculture
to find an “objectively and scientifically”

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.850
sound way to measure the hardness of a piece
of wood.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.930
For the curious, according to the Janka test,
the softest wood in the world belongs to the

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.450
Cuipo tree, which has a rating of just 22
lbf (pounds-force) making it is drastically

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.730
softer than Balsa wood which has a higher,
but still very low rating (as you’ll soon

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.810
see) of 100 lbf.

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.430
Interestingly enough, like Balsa wood, Cuipo
wood is classified as a hardwood.

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.040
The hardest wood is said to come from the
Australian Buloke (pronounced “Bull-oak”)

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.410
tree, with a staggering rating of 5060 lbf.

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.990
(For reference, a commonly worked with type
of wood that is generally considered very

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:05.680
hard is Hickory, which rings in at 1820 lbf.)

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.130
Wood from the Buloke is fairly difficult to
come by, so not often worked with, though

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.080
woodworkers who’ve had the chance often
describe it as being “like a rock”.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.110
However, this is relative to many other woods.

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.090
In truth, it can be cut with a regular old
handsaw.

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:36.319
It just takes a lot more time and effort than
most commonly worked with woods.
