00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:06.379
Welcome to another edition of Crash Course! Today -- what is that smell? Oh, thanks for the rotten eggs.

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:09.410
Who is this -- who -- why are we doing this?

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.219
I mean, are going to be using this to illustrate
some kind of scientific principle?

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:18.279
Because we probably could have, like, used some,
like, some lilacs or something that wasn't egg.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:24.320
So, like, we're saying, "I can smell it when I'm this close, but if I were farther away, I couldn't smell it."

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.700
Now, eggs produce hydrogen sulfide when they start to go bad, which smells like sulfur --

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.099
that's what we think of when we think of the
"sulfur smell."

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.360
It takes time for the molecules of hydrogen
sulfide to make their way to my nose,

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.600
'cause obviously gases don't travel from one
place to another instantly.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.480
It take some time since, as we've learned
over the past couple of weeks,

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.810
gases have real-life constraints on how they
move here in the non-ideal world.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.120
These are the rules that determine, say, how
fast a leaking tire goes flat;

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:55.280
or why helium balloons don't last forever;
and, of course, how, where, and when we smell stuff.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.220
One key to understanding the behavior of a gas is its velocity, that is, the speed and direction that it moves.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.300
And THAT depends on a few important physical
factors.

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.009
You ready to learn more? Let's do it.

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:07.980
That smell IS coming from the eggs, isn't
it?

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:17.180
[Theme Music]

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.020
So. "Velocity of a gas": what does that even mean? I mean, it's easy to understand the velocity of a car.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.159
You can find the velocity by dividing the distance that the thing traveled by the time it took to do it,

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:29.920
and then tell what direction it's going, and
then you're done.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.720
But the velocity of gases is harder t describe, because they move in more than one direction at a time,

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.960
and the overall shape and volume of a gas
cloud can change constantly.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.830
To understand gas velocity, we have to know
what factors affect it, and how.

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.890
As you might have guessed, there's math associated
with this.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.600
There are two ways of studying and talking
about gases.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.560
First, we can consider them as a collection of atoms or molecules that act together as a system.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.090
When we do that, we often talk about the net
velocity,

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.130
or how fast a sample of gas moves from one
place to another,

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.400
like the rotten egg smell wafting its way
to my nose.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.260
At other times, we focus on the individual
atoms and molecules that make up the gas.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.159
In that case, we use the average velocity
of each of the particles.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.580
That's the statistical mean of the speeds of all the individual atoms or molecules in the system.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.379
There are always faster ones and slower ones,
but it all evens out in the mean.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.660
The net velocity of a gas in any one direction will always be lower than the average velocity of its molecules

00:02:24.669 --> 00:02:29.469
because the overall motion of the gas is hindered
by collisions among the individual particles.

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:35.269
As with most things in chemistry, and also with life, how a gas moves is more complex than it at first appears.

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:40.279
The individual particles in a gas never move at exactly the same speed or direction for very long,

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.540
instead, they bounce around like crazy, bumping into the walls of the container and each other over and over.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.279
It's sort of like a group of kids in a hallway,

00:02:47.279 --> 00:02:51.189
they may be moving fast individually, but
they bounce around a lot and get sidetracked.

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:53.180
They always make it to the lunchroom eventually,

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.880
but the group's overall speed is lower than
the speed of any individual kid.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.940
So. What makes a gas move faster or slower?

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:04.730
Well we already know that gas atoms and molecules
move faster when the temperature increases.

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.330
We can understand why that happens by remembering
what temperature actually is:

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.919
Temperature is a property of matter that is
proportional to the average

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:15.680
or mean kinetic energy of all the atoms or
molecules in the system.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.340
We sometimes think of temperature merely in terms of measuring hotness -- not that kind of hotness!

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.230
The hotness or coldness of a material, and
it is related to that,

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.840
but when you get right down to it temperature is really just a way of expressing average kinetic energy.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.740
The reason a stove burns you, is that the
fast moving particles of the burner

00:03:32.749 --> 00:03:37.749
make the particles in your hand move so fast
that they tear apart your cells and tissues.

00:03:37.749 --> 00:03:39.840
It's just a transfer of kinetic energy.

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:43.840
And what does kinetic energy have to do with
velocity? Everything.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.239
And, it also describes the relationship between
a particle's velocity and its mass.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.520
So, a good understanding of kinetic energy
will help a lot as we study the motion of gases.

00:03:52.529 --> 00:03:57.409
So first, the formula for kinetic energy is
one half m v squared.

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:02.049
And as you can see, any changes in the kinetic
energy are directly linked to changes in velocity.

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:05.279
If we rearrange the formula, we find that
the velocity of a body equals

00:04:05.279 --> 00:04:09.790
the square root of two times the kinetic energy,
divided by its mass.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.400
This little math exercise highlights two important
points.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.960
One: because the mass is in the denominator, we can tell that it is inversely proportional to the velocity,

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:22.680
meaning that bigger masses move more slowly than smaller masses that have the same kinetic energy.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.780
And two: the velocity is proportional to the
square root of the mass,

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.140
meaning that a fairly large change in mass is required to make a significant change in the velocity.

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.790
So, now we can show how the velocity of a
gas relates to both its temperature,

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.560
and therefore its average kinetic energy;
and also to the mass of its particles.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.070
But, how do we put that all together?

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.900
This is where the Scottish chemist Thomas
Graham comes in.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.640
In 1846, Graham published his research on
the motion of gas particles.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.050
Which he did by passing gases, if you will,
through a porous barrier.

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.920
The process by which gases travel through
an orifice or opening is known as effusion.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.800
Graham was interested in how fast the gases
pass through the barrier.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.090
But this is called the rate of effusion, not
the velocity.

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.340
That's because here we're measuring the amount of gas that passes through at any given period of time,

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.730
not the distance that it moves in that time.

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:14.860
We might measure amount in terms of moles or in terms of volume, but the rate of effusion never uses distance.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.100
One more thing before we move on, don't let
the symbols confuse you.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:24.640
Notice that lower case v stand for velocity and capital V stands for volume - the perils of symbols.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.200
Thomas Graham measured the rates of effusion
for various gases

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.550
and his results fit perfectly with what we
already know: the more massive a gas is, the

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:32.780
more slowly it moves.

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:37.260
From his observations, Graham developed a formula -- now known as Graham's Law of Effusion --

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.420
for comparing the rates of effusion of different
gases.

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:46.280
It states: Under identical conditions, the ratio of the rate of effusion of gas a to the rate of effusion of gas b

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:52.440
is equal to the ratio of the square root of the molar mass of gas b to the square root of the molar mass of gas a.

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:55.930
It is a mouthful, but it really just confirms
what we deduced earlier:

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:01.280
the rate of motion of a gas is inversely proportional
to the square root of its mass.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.480
For example, if it takes 4.5 minutes for 1.0 liter of helium to effuse through a porous barrier,

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:11.240
how long will it take for 1.0 liter of chlorine
to effuse under identical conditions?

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.460
All we need to figure it out, is Graham's
Law.

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.480
Let's make the helium gas a, and chlorine
will be our gas b.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:21.160
First, we have to find helium's rate of effusion -- in this case, we're using Volume with a capital V.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:26.730
So for helium, 1.0 liter in 4.5 minutes gives
the rate of 0.22 liters per minute.

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:32.510
So, we plug that into the main formula -- chlorine gas has a molar mass of two times that of atomic chlorine --

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:38.370
35.5 times two equals 70.9,
and helium's molar mass is 4.00.

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:39.640
Put those numbers in too.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:46.600
Careful calculation shows that Cl2's rate of effusion under these conditions would be 0.052 liters per minute,

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.680
significantly slower than helium.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.130
This, of course, is reasonable, because Cl2
is much more massive than helium.

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.930
Graham mainly studied gases passing through
orifices in a barrier,

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:58.830
but gases aren't usually trapped with an orifice
in a barrier.

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:03.210
They are usually able to just move freely, so how do we study their motion under those conditions?

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:04.610
When gases are allowed to move freely,

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:08.570
they tend to move from regions of high concentration
to regions of low concentration.

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:11.200
In a sense, they move away from places where
they're crowded

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.750
and toward places where they have a little
bit more elbow room.

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:17.840
The difference in concentration between two
points is called a concentration gradient,

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:22.910
and it's kind of like a hill that matter rolls
down, always moving from high to low.

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:26.960
Gases spread out like that until they've dispersed
evenly throughout the available space.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.760
This process is called diffusion.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:34.820
Now, it's important to keep in mind that the particles in a gas don't work together somehow to move in a specific direction.

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:37.200
Remember those kids making their way down
the hall?

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.340
They all know where the lunchroom is, and
they're hungry,

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:43.560
so even though there are a lot of distractions,
they move purposely toward their destination.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:47.080
Gases, on the other hand, only appear to move
in a specific direction.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:52.860
It's really just random collisions pushing the molecules apart, thus making them spread out in every direction.

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:57.880
In other words, the gross eggy gas that I smelled earlier didn't travel just toward my nose;

00:07:57.889 --> 00:08:00.830
its particles spread out in every direction
from the eggs,

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:04.450
and my nose simply noticed the ones that happened
to have spread in THAT direction.

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:07.150
Because diffusion is completely free movement,

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:09.830
calculating the motion of individual particles
becomes even more complicated.

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:13.419
Now, we're not gonna get into the super complex
mathematics of all these collisions,

00:08:13.419 --> 00:08:16.860
but it is possible to make decent estimates
regarding the net velocity of gases

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:22.080
simply by disregarding the collisions and applying Graham's Law of Effusion to diffusion as well.

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:25.790
Here's how it works: This is a simple acrylic
tube -- nothing fancy.

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:29.460
On one side, we have a cotton ball that's
soaked with concentrated ammonia,

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:33.149
and on the other side, a cotton ball soaked
with concentrated hydrochloric acid,

00:08:33.149 --> 00:08:35.490
which is why we're doing this in a lab, and
not at my desk.

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:39.199
Both of these substances are very smelly,
because they're giving off lots of fumes,

00:08:39.199 --> 00:08:43.849
or in other words, a lot of the molecules
in the liquid are being released in gas form.

00:08:43.849 --> 00:08:49.469
When we put the cotton balls in the glass tube and close off the ends, those gases continue to spread,

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:52.899
but they have no where to go except farther
into the tube.

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:58.700
Fun fact: ammonia and hydrochloric acid react together readily to form a solid -- ammonium chloride.

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:03.540
That's a precipitation reaction, but this time it's happening in a mixture of gases, not liquids.

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:06.000
Because the ammonium chloride is a solid at
room temperature,

00:09:06.009 --> 00:09:09.519
it forms a superfine white powder where the
two gases meet in the tubes,

00:09:09.519 --> 00:09:13.979
so we'll be able to tell exactly how far each
gas traveled before they met.

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:15.860
Let's try to figure out where that's going
to be.

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:19.730
First of all, remember that Graham's Law is
only an estimate when applied to diffusion,

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:22.499
but it's a good enough estimate to work for
our purposes, here.

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:29.199
The molar mass of ammonium, which we call "gas a," is 17 and the molar mass of hydrochloric acid, "gas b," is 36.

00:09:29.199 --> 00:09:33.050
If we plug those into Graham's Law, and set
hydrochloric acid's rate of diffusion at 1.0,

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:35.839
since we are only looking for a ratio, here,

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:41.640
we'll find that ammonia's rate of diffusion will be about 1.5 times as fast as that of hydrochloric acid.

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:46.940
That means that the ammonium chloride should form about 3/5 of the way down the tube from the NH3

00:09:46.949 --> 00:09:49.729
and about 2/5 of the way from the HCl.

00:09:49.729 --> 00:09:55.229
And, there it is. See that white cloud? That's
the ammonium chloride powder forming.

00:09:55.229 --> 00:09:56.740
It'll eventually settle in the glass,

00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:01.360
but it's so fine that even the tiny currents that occur as the two gases mix are enough to toss it around a little.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:04.520
The ammonia has indeed moved through about
three fifths of the tube.

00:10:04.529 --> 00:10:08.220
Meanwhile the hydrochloric acid has only traveled
through about two fifths of the tube.

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:11.389
So, we've proven now that Graham's Law, as
an estimate at least, works.

00:10:11.389 --> 00:10:16.700
The distances that the two gases traveled were indeed proportional to their molar masses. Makes sense.

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:21.300
That's one of the cool things about science: it always ends up making sense, once you know what you're looking for.

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:24.879
And that's it for this episode of Crash Course
Chemistry. Thank you for watching.

00:10:24.879 --> 00:10:28.850
If you listened carefully, you learned the
difference between the net velocity of a gas

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:30.920
and the average velocity of its particles,

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:34.869
and that both things have a lot to do with
the mass and kinetic energy of the particles.

00:10:34.869 --> 00:10:38.949
You learned about effusion and what Thomas
Graham's Law of Effusion tells us about it,

00:10:38.949 --> 00:10:42.569
and how the law of effusion can also be applied
to diffusion, but not as reliably.

00:10:42.569 --> 00:10:45.990
You also learned that the collisions that
occur among the particles of a gas

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:50.210
have a huge effect on both its motion and
our attempts to calculate it.

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:52.300
You learned what a concentration gradient
is,

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:56.029
and finally, you learned how to do a precipitation
reaction with gases.

00:10:56.029 --> 00:10:58.329
This episode of Crash Course Chemistry was
written by Edi González.

00:10:58.329 --> 00:11:02.149
Who I have to commend for only making one
fart joke in the whole script!

00:11:02.149 --> 00:11:04.790
The script was edited by Blake de Pastino
and myself.

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:07.189
And our chemistry consultant was Dr. Heiko
Langner.

00:11:07.189 --> 00:11:11.420
It was filmed, edited, and directed by Nicholas Jenkins. Our script supervisor was Caitlin Hofmeister.

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:15.080
Our sound designer is Michael Aranda.
And our graphics team is Thought Café.
