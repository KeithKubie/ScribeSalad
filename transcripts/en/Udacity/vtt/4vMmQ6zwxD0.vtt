00:00:00.355 --> 00:00:01.430
Here's sort of the last thing.

00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:03.510
I guess I'm kind of done with
solution concepts, right?

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.060
So I said that we've
done Nash Equilibrium.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.400
We did Subgame Perfect.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.240
We have now done Correlated Equilibrium,
and

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.990
we're not going to talk about
any of these other things.

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.698
So I guess we're done.

00:00:12.698 --> 00:00:15.990
&gt;&gt; I was really hoping that we would
talk about at least the Coco thing.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.430
I think we said in a summary that
there's more to say about that.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.400
&gt;&gt; Well there's more to say
about everything, Michael.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.552
But that doesn't mean
that we have to say it.

00:00:22.552 --> 00:00:25.826
Just because we can do something
it does not follow that we should.

00:00:25.826 --> 00:00:28.580
&gt;&gt; So but, I mean, Coco is interesting
in some of the same ways that

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.525
Correlated Equilibrium
are interested in.

00:00:30.525 --> 00:00:33.734
Sort of sort of goes a little
bit beyond it in some ways.

00:00:33.734 --> 00:00:36.953
I feel like it would kind of round
out the story really nicely.

00:00:36.953 --> 00:00:39.414
&gt;&gt; Okay, well, you know I'm a big
fan of story rounding-outing.

00:00:39.414 --> 00:00:42.870
So
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] With TD TD MDT.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.730
&gt;&gt; I am more than happy
to let you do that.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:45.521
Would you like to?

00:00:45.521 --> 00:00:46.697
&gt;&gt; Sure!
Yeah, I can do that.

00:00:46.697 --> 00:00:48.357
&gt;&gt; Okay, well then, here's the pen.

00:00:48.357 --> 00:00:50.749
&gt;&gt; Great, so if you just don't mind.

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:51.608
Wait, no, aah!

00:00:51.608 --> 00:00:54.900
[BEEP] Great,
now I will take it from there.
