00:00:04.738 --> 00:00:06.573
- [clears throat]

00:00:06.573 --> 00:00:08.408
Welcome back to
another installment

00:00:08.408 --> 00:00:10.878
of "The Van and Mike Show:
The Ascension."

00:00:10.878 --> 00:00:12.212
Shall I say, maybe,

00:00:12.212 --> 00:00:13.780
just right at this
particular moment in time,

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.916
just "The Van and Mike Show,"

00:00:15.916 --> 00:00:18.151
'cause...well,
we are no longer affiliated

00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:20.654
with the television program
"Key &amp; Peele."

00:00:20.654 --> 00:00:21.955
- Parted ways.

00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:24.291
- We've parted ways.

00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:34.301
It was untenable, the situation
altogether at this point.

00:00:34.301 --> 00:00:38.105
And I feel like, you know,
factions versus factions,

00:00:38.105 --> 00:00:40.073
internal civil wars and whatnot.

00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:41.708
People wanted to get us
off of the show.

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:43.510
We showed up on set,
we started working,

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.345
nobody said anything.

00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:46.480
What were we supposed to do?

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.448
- And when the show
goes down in flames,

00:00:48.448 --> 00:00:50.250
they gonna try
and turn it on us.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.418
- Pin it on us.

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:53.387
And the thing is,
what the worst part is,

00:00:53.387 --> 00:00:54.454
you're gonna see them

00:00:54.454 --> 00:00:56.523
in the midst
of their chicanery

00:00:56.523 --> 00:00:58.659
while you watch
this video, man.

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:00.227
- Their Sean Connery.

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.465
- See, it's a tragedy
that that word play

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:07.768
is never gonna make it
on "Key &amp; Peele."

00:01:07.768 --> 00:01:09.069
I said "chicanery,"

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:12.272
and this genius nigga back here
said the "Sean Connery."

00:01:12.272 --> 00:01:13.941
Anyway, watch this clip.

00:01:13.941 --> 00:01:16.743
Some bullshit.

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:20.681
- Save her life!

00:01:20.681 --> 00:01:23.383
- And cut, and cut.

00:01:23.383 --> 00:01:24.818
- Um, Peter?

00:01:24.818 --> 00:01:27.554
- Dude, Peele,
that's Rashida Jones.

00:01:27.554 --> 00:01:29.256
- No, no,
you can't call cut, man.

00:01:29.256 --> 00:01:30.624
- That's Rashida Jones,
though.

00:01:30.624 --> 00:01:32.292
- Vandaveon.
- What's up?

00:01:32.292 --> 00:01:33.460
- Get him out of here.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.329
- Who called cut?
- I did.

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:36.930
- Hey, dude.
- What the fuck are you doing?

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:37.998
- You can't call cut.

00:01:37.998 --> 00:01:39.399
- That's Rashida Jones,
though.

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:40.667
- Yeah, you can't
fucking call cut.

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:42.169
- You're out of here,
it's done.

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:44.204
- Get of the fuck--
get off the set.

00:01:44.204 --> 00:01:45.706
- Get out.
- No, wait a second--

00:01:45.706 --> 00:01:48.108
- You're out, you're fired,
you're off the show.

00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:49.977
You are off the show.
Don't talk anymore.

00:01:49.977 --> 00:01:51.411
- But what about me
getting your phone number,

00:01:51.411 --> 00:01:52.412
though, Rashida?

00:01:52.412 --> 00:01:55.716
- You're fired,
good-bye.

00:01:55.716 --> 00:01:57.985
- So, basically,

00:01:57.985 --> 00:01:59.786
the clip speak for itself.

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:01.388
We followed the rules.

00:02:01.388 --> 00:02:03.190
We followed protocol.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:04.691
I called cut.

00:02:04.691 --> 00:02:07.628
I said the word on set
that people say

00:02:07.628 --> 00:02:09.963
when you want people
to stop shooting.

00:02:09.963 --> 00:02:11.565
You say, "Cut."

00:02:11.565 --> 00:02:13.267
And then gave a compliment

00:02:13.267 --> 00:02:15.402
to the female guest star
of the show.

00:02:15.402 --> 00:02:17.804
You got Rashida Jones
in that bed,

00:02:17.804 --> 00:02:18.972
acting her ass off.

00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:22.075
And in that moment,
I just felt like, to me,

00:02:22.075 --> 00:02:23.510
just we should point this out.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:24.811
- Nigga punched you
in the face.

00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:25.812
- Oh, yeah, by the way,

00:02:25.812 --> 00:02:27.881
I'm suing them for assault,

00:02:27.881 --> 00:02:29.983
'cause that big white dude
with the muscles and everything,

00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:31.785
that motherfucker
punched me in the mouth.

00:02:31.785 --> 00:02:33.153
This foundation right here.

00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:35.255
I got a big-ass bruise
on my mouth.

00:02:35.255 --> 00:02:37.090
- We pressing charges.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.992
We gonna get hundreds
of thousands of dollars

00:02:38.992 --> 00:02:39.993
on that bitch.

00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:41.128
- Hundreds of thousands
of dollars.

00:02:41.128 --> 00:02:42.729
- Look out,
Comedy Central.

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:46.133
Or you could
just produce our show.

00:02:46.133 --> 00:02:47.601
- There's two ways
to go about it.

00:02:47.601 --> 00:02:49.102
So, anyway, we're gonna go
on a brief hiatus

00:02:49.102 --> 00:02:50.103
for this program.

00:02:50.103 --> 00:02:52.339
We got to re-group,
re-think of some things,

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:54.508
figure out how to redo
the business model,

00:02:54.508 --> 00:02:56.610
get some Venn diagrams
on up in here,

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.111
do some geometry.

00:02:58.111 --> 00:02:59.513
Or at least start a podcast.

00:02:59.513 --> 00:03:01.048
So look out
for our podcast,

00:03:01.048 --> 00:03:02.816
'cause that's gonna be
the next thing.

00:03:02.816 --> 00:03:03.851
- It's sad.

00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:04.885
- It really is sad.

00:03:04.885 --> 00:03:06.186
The whole thing's
just falling apart.

00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:07.654
It's like we're Rome.

00:03:07.654 --> 00:03:09.323
I'm really sorry, everybody.

00:03:09.323 --> 00:03:11.725
We're gonna come back to you
right quick with some new stuff,

00:03:11.725 --> 00:03:15.062
but this has been--
this has been a disappointment.
