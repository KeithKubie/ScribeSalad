00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:03.360
Why is Aluminum Foil Shiny on One Side But
Not the Other?

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.539
The most abundant metal in the Earth’s crust,
aluminum naturally occurs as a compound with

00:00:07.539 --> 00:00:11.020
other elements, such as aluminum oxide or
potassium aluminum sulfate.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:16.430
As such, it was not isolated as a separate
element until 1825 when a Danish chemist,

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.550
Hans Christian Oersted, was able to produce
a small amount.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.670
By 1845, a German chemist, Friedrich Wöhler,
had perfected a way of producing enough aluminum

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.100
to be able to study it.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:32.320
In 1854, the French chemist, Henri Étienne
Sainte-Claire Deville improved on Wöhler’s

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.140
method and developed a process to commercially
produce the element, although it still remained

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.380
expensive, even more than gold.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:43.090
Other improvements were made independently
by chemists Charles Martin Hall (American)

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:44.100
and Paul L.T.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.000
Héroult (French) in 1886, and by Karl Joseph
Bayer (Austrian) in 1888.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.600
As a result, sufficiently large quantities
of aluminum oxide were now able to be produced

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.680
from bauxite, and then aluminum could easily
be obtained from the aluminum oxide.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.170
This greatly reduced the cost of aluminum,
and in 1888, Charles Martin Hall formed the

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.150
precursor to the Aluminum Company of America
(Alcoa), the Pittsburgh Reduction Company.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.600
Production methods continued to improve and
by 1909, the Pittsburgh company’s output

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.340
was at 41,000 kg per day.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.880
By 1910, the first manufacturing plant for
the production of aluminum foil opened in

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.150
Emmishofen, Switzerland by Dr. Lauber, Neher
&amp; Cie.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.270
So why is aluminum foil shiny on one side
and not as much on the other?

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.450
In what is called the Bayer Process, after
pure molten aluminum is obtained from aluminum

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.049
oxide, it is placed in furnaces with a small
amount of other elements (typically the final

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:43.730
product will be between 99.8% and 99.9% aluminum).

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.869
This liquid is then poured into “chill casting
devices where it cools into large slabs called

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:49.869
‘ingots.'”

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.860
Next the ingot is treated with heat (annealed),
and then rolled between heavy rollers.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.990
This initial foil is sent through still more
rollers, several times, until it reaches the

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.420
desired thinness.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.640
For the type of foil that is bright on one
side and matte on the other, it is so thin

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.149
that during some of the last rollings, two
sheets of the thin foil must be placed together

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.940
lest they tear or crimp during the final rolling
of the sheets.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.959
One consequence of this is that while the
sides that touch the highly polished rollers

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:22.019
are burnished to a bright finish, the inner
sides that touch the other aluminum foil remain

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:23.019
matte.

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:26.650
Bonus Foil Facts:
• Before aluminum became cheap and readily

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.769
available, during the last part of the 19th
and early 20th centuries, a type of thin foil,

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.120
used commercially, was actually made of tin
(tin foil).

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:41.199
Because of the popularity of this foil, today
many call aluminum foil this name.

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:45.449
• More than just packaging, aluminum can
be used to polish silver: after lining a deep

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:50.620
pan with foil, cover it with cold water and
add a couple of teaspoons of salt and your

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:51.620
silverware.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.540
Chemistry (magic) will remove the tarnish.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.220
A similar process can be used to clean jewelry,
except exchange the cold water for hot, and

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.730
the salt for a tablespoon of laundry detergent.

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:07.560
Likewise, a sheet of aluminum foil underneath
freshly polished silverware will deter tarnishing.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:23.620
• Scissors can be sharpened by cutting through
several layers of aluminum foil 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.049
a few times.
