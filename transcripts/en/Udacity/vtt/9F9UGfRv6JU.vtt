00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:03.940
We've just gone over the essential
things that you need

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.220
to be able to train a simple
linear classification model.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.810
Now, it's your turn.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.690
How well does this work?

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.170
Pretty well, as you will see
in your first assignment.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.375
The first part of it will
have you download and

00:00:15.375 --> 00:00:20.130
pre-process an image data set that you
will be reusing throughout the lectures,

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.970
and that you can use
yourself to experiment with.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.710
The second part will have you go
through an exact re-implementation,

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:27.870
piece by piece,

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.330
of all the components of the logistic
classifier that we've discussed so far.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.779
Make sure that you carefully step
through the code before coming back to

00:00:36.779 --> 00:00:37.542
the videos.

00:00:37.542 --> 00:00:40.334
Run it, break it, tinker with it.

00:00:40.334 --> 00:00:42.599
We'll be building on top of it for
the rest of the lecture.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.610
You'll also quickly see some of
the problems with the simple approach.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.870
It can be very slow.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:49.640
Even for

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.510
a simple model like this linear model on
a very small amount of training data.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.950
Scaling this up is what
deep learning is all about.
