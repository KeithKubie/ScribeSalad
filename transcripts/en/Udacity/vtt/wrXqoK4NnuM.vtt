00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.850
I did want to mention at this point that

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:05.930
there are other viewpoint controls. There's an initial scale property

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.570
that let's you set what the browser's initial scaling factor

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.490
will be. It defaults to one and usually, you don't

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.740
really want to mess with it. If you change it to

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.250
another number, this changes the initial zoom factor. And the

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.270
user will probably have to pan or zoom. There is

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.080
one very critical use to initial scale though. On iOS,

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.350
if you only set width to device width and

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.670
you don't set the initial scale, like in this page,

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.610
when you rotate the screen the iOS web engine

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.080
will keep the same view port width and rescale it

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.330
to fit across the landscape screen. It's just stretching

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.810
the portrait layout, to fit, across the landscape width. Even

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.040
though I've set width to device width, IOS is

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.040
still scaling the landscape width. In fact, the interesting bit.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.690
is that even if you load this page initially

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.790
in landscape mode, it still thinks it's the portrait

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.920
width, it just rescaling it to fit in the

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.990
landscape screen. Now, if you have the same page,

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.370
but you set the initial scale to 1 in

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.070
the viewport meta-element along with setting device width, it'll

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.520
change the viewport size when you rotate, instead of

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.220
rescaling. You can see now the window size is 480

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.460
pixels across. It's the landscape width, not the

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.500
portrait width. So, in short, this is what

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.660
you really need to use as your default

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.850
boiler plate viewport meta-element. You'll need the initial scale,

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.090
so that IRS, when flipping from portrait to

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.110
landscape mode will still scale correctly. An interesting side

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.530
note I discovered is that on Iphones -

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.290
Although they are changing the viewport size properly if

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.630
an initial scale is that, they are also

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.780
changing the default font size for the document

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.250
and orientation change, effectively zooming up the text

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.820
when you go to landscape mode. This means

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.510
you should probably set a default font size

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.970
on the page, not just use an percentages.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.570
You may want to use a reset style sheet to do this, if you aren't already.
