- [groans] Stay together.

00:00:11.677 --> 00:00:13.980
- Put them all together.
- Okay.

00:00:14.013 --> 00:00:15.915
- And then, just...
- I do this.

00:00:15.948 --> 00:00:17.150
I go there.
- No, that's--

00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:19.852
that's the shocker. [laughs]
- Oh.

00:00:19.885 --> 00:00:21.654 line:0%
- Hi, I'm Ashley Nicole Black,

00:00:21.687 --> 00:00:24.524 line:0%
and today we're talking about
Nichelle Nichols.

00:00:24.557 --> 00:00:28.261 line:0%
<i> So it's 1964,</i>

00:00:28.294 --> 00:00:31.097 line:0%
<i> and Nichelle Nichols
 guest stars</i>

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.733 line:0%
<i> on an episode of a show
 called "The Lieutenant,"</i>

00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:35.435 line:0%
<i> that's run by
 Gene Roddenberry.</i>

00:00:35.468 --> 00:00:37.336
<i> And Gene Roddenberry was like,</i>

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:39.605
<i> you're amazing;
 you're so beautiful.</i>

00:00:39.638 --> 00:00:42.341
<i> Do you wanna be on this
 new show called "Star Trek"?</i>

00:00:42.374 --> 00:00:43.409
<i> Here's my plan.</i>

00:00:43.442 --> 00:00:45.778
<i> It's gonna be super utopian,</i>

00:00:45.811 --> 00:00:47.880
<i> and black ladies
 can be bosses,</i>

00:00:47.913 --> 00:00:49.549
<i> so this is exactly
 a really big deal.</i>

00:00:49.582 --> 00:00:52.418
<i> So Nichelle Nichols is like,
 that sounds chill as hell,</i>

00:00:52.451 --> 00:00:53.753
<i> so let's do that show.</i>

00:00:53.786 --> 00:00:56.456 line:0%
<i> So they start
 filming "Star Trek,"</i>

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.925 line:0%
<i> and Nichelle Nichols plays
 Lieutenant Uhura,</i>

00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:01.294 line:0%
<i> who's the communications
 officer, so she's like,</i>

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:03.529 line:0%
<i> Captain, I have something
 to communicate with you.</i>

00:01:03.562 --> 00:01:05.064
<i> Boo-boo-boo-boo-boo.</i>

00:01:05.097 --> 00:01:07.567
<i> And she has nails that are
 way too long for space.</i>

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.868
But also...

00:01:08.901 --> 00:01:11.637
Nichelle Nichols doesn't
actually watch the show,

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.607
<i> because back then,
 TV came on at a certain time,</i>

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.409
<i> and she was at work
 during that time.</i>

00:01:16.442 --> 00:01:17.877
<i> So at the end of
 the first season,</i>

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.612
<i> she's like,
 "Star Trek" is cool, whatever.</i>

00:01:19.645 --> 00:01:20.947
<i> I don't know
 if anybody watches it.</i>

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.915
<i> But my dream
 is to be on Broadway.</i>

00:01:22.948 --> 00:01:24.917
<i> I wanna sing.
 I wanna dance.</i>

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.452
<i> And she goes to
 Gene Roddenberry,</i>

00:01:26.485 --> 00:01:28.154
<i> and she's like,
 hey, I'm gonna go to Broadway,</i>

00:01:28.187 --> 00:01:30.590
<i> so I'm done Trekking.
 I'm done.</i>

00:01:30.623 --> 00:01:33.059
<i> So, he tells her,
 like, please,</i>

00:01:33.092 --> 00:01:35.128
<i> just, like, take the weekend
 to think about it.</i>

00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:37.296
<i> And she was like,
 whatever, bitch, fine.</i>

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:38.898
<i> So that weekend,</i>

00:01:38.931 --> 00:01:41.834
<i> Nichelle Nichols goes to
 an NAACP fundraiser,</i>

00:01:41.867 --> 00:01:44.036
<i> and one of the organizers
 comes up to her,</i>

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:46.305
<i> and is like,
 hey, there's a guy here,</i>

00:01:46.338 --> 00:01:47.640
<i> and he's your biggest fan,</i>

00:01:47.673 --> 00:01:49.008
<i> and he really wants
 to meet you.</i>

00:01:49.041 --> 00:01:51.110
<i> And she's like,
 okay, cool, whatever.</i>

00:01:51.143 --> 00:01:52.345
<i> Bring on the nerd.</i>

00:01:52.378 --> 00:01:54.046
<i> And she sees her fan,</i>

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:57.116
<i> and he's like,
 your show is the only show</i>

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.018
<i> that I allow
 my three little children</i>

00:01:59.051 --> 00:02:00.419
<i> to stay up and watch.</i>

00:02:00.452 --> 00:02:02.088
<i> We love "Star Trek."
 It's so good.</i>

00:02:02.121 --> 00:02:05.925
<i> And she's like, excuse me,
 are you Martin Luther King?</i>

00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:09.228
<i> And he's like, yes,
 I am Martin Luther King,</i>

00:02:09.261 --> 00:02:10.663
<i> and I'm a Trekkie.</i>

00:02:10.696 --> 00:02:13.432
<i> And she's like, [bleep] me.
 - [chuckles]</i>

00:02:13.465 --> 00:02:14.667
- But it's real.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.537
Martin Luther King
loved "Star Trek."

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:18.938
<i> And he's like,</i>

00:02:18.971 --> 00:02:21.107
<i> you are the only
 black woman on television</i>

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.708
<i> who doesn't play a servant.</i>

00:02:22.741 --> 00:02:25.578
<i> You're the only person
 out there providing hope</i>

00:02:25.611 --> 00:02:27.580
<i> to black people
 that there's a future,</i>

00:02:27.613 --> 00:02:29.849
<i> where maybe they won't be
 seen as less than,</i>

00:02:29.882 --> 00:02:31.350
<i> and they'll be seen as equals.</i>

00:02:31.383 --> 00:02:33.653
<i> And she's like,
 wow, that's great,</i>

00:02:33.686 --> 00:02:36.155
<i> except for I'm leaving.</i>

00:02:36.188 --> 00:02:38.224
<i> I quit "Star Trek" this week.
 I'm so sorry.</i>

00:02:38.257 --> 00:02:41.160
<i> And he's like,
 no, you can't quit.</i>

00:02:41.193 --> 00:02:42.328
<i> Do you realize that you are</i>

00:02:42.361 --> 00:02:44.096
<i> the first black
 "women" who's--</i>

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:45.831
black woman.

00:02:45.864 --> 00:02:47.900
He wasn't drunk
when he said it.

00:02:47.933 --> 00:02:49.902
- No, it's okay.
- I was drunk.

00:02:49.935 --> 00:02:52.004
But Martin Luther King
was like, if you leave,

00:02:52.037 --> 00:02:54.006
<i> this one image
 that children have</i>

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:55.508
<i> of a black woman as an equal</i>

00:02:55.541 --> 00:02:57.376
<i> will just disappear
 from television.</i>

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:00.746
<i> And she's like,
 well, [bleep], that's a lot.</i>

00:03:00.779 --> 00:03:02.048
<i> That's, like, a lot.</i>

00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:03.716
<i> That's a lot on my shoulders.</i>

00:03:03.749 --> 00:03:05.351
<i> Can you chill?
 And he's like,</i>

00:03:05.384 --> 00:03:07.386
<i> No, I'm Martin Luther King.
 I have no chill.</i>

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:10.690
<i> And she was like,
 okay, I'll think about it.</i>

00:03:10.723 --> 00:03:12.625 align:start position:0%
Stay tuned
for more "Drunk History."

00:03:12.658 --> 00:03:14.527 align:start position:0%
Do you know how the first
interracial kiss

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.462 align:start position:0%
on television happened?

00:03:17.696 --> 00:03:20.700
- So Nichelle Nichols goes
into Gene Roddenberry's office,

00:03:20.733 --> 00:03:22.034
<i> and she's like, Gene,</i>

00:03:22.067 --> 00:03:23.970
<i> I met Martin Luther King
 this weekend,</i>

00:03:24.003 --> 00:03:25.771
<i> and he really likes your shit.</i>

00:03:25.804 --> 00:03:27.974
And he's like, oh, my God...

00:03:28.007 --> 00:03:31.477
<i> [gasps] Someone understands
 what I'm trying to do here.</i>

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.279
<i> She's like, oh, my God,
 shut the [bleep] up.</i>

00:03:33.312 --> 00:03:34.447
<i> That's not the point.</i>

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.982
<i> The point is, this show</i>

00:03:36.015 --> 00:03:38.351
<i> is going to advance
 racial equality.</i>

00:03:38.384 --> 00:03:39.819
<i> I'll stay on your show.</i>

00:03:39.852 --> 00:03:42.722
So, you know,
they're filming "Star Wars."

00:03:42.755 --> 00:03:44.190
<i> It's great.
 - Is that true?</i>

00:03:44.223 --> 00:03:47.927
- Oh, my God.
[laughter]

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.595
Also very good.

00:03:49.628 --> 00:03:52.698
<i> So they're doing "Star Trek."</i>

00:03:52.731 --> 00:03:54.867
<i> It's great. People love it.</i>

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.736
<i> At some point,
 Gene Roddenberry's like,</i>

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.471
<i> I know--we're gonna
 push the envelope.</i>

00:03:58.504 --> 00:04:01.107
<i> We're gonna have
 the first interracial kiss.</i>

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.242
<i> And William Shatner
 is like, hell yes.</i>

00:04:03.275 --> 00:04:05.211
<i> And Nichelle Nichols
 is like, whatever, fine.</i>

00:04:05.244 --> 00:04:08.214
<i> But the network came down
 and was like, whoa, hold on,</i>

00:04:08.247 --> 00:04:10.049
<i> we can't have
 an interracial kiss on TV.</i>

00:04:10.082 --> 00:04:12.318
<i> So William Shatner
 convinces them,</i>

00:04:12.351 --> 00:04:13.886
<i> let's shoot it both ways.</i>

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:15.521
<i> We'll shoot it
 with the kiss first,</i>

00:04:15.554 --> 00:04:17.089
<i> and then,
 we'll shoot it without,</i>

00:04:17.122 --> 00:04:20.192
<i> and you can decide
 what you wanna do in editing.</i>

00:04:20.225 --> 00:04:22.762
<i> So they shoot the scene
 with the kiss,</i>

00:04:22.795 --> 00:04:24.930
<i> and then, he's like,
 you know what, I have a note.</i>

00:04:24.963 --> 00:04:27.133
<i> Let's try it again.
 Let's try it again.</i>

00:04:27.166 --> 00:04:28.601
<i> Let's do it one more time.</i>

00:04:28.634 --> 00:04:30.870
<i> And they shoot it
 over and over</i>

00:04:30.903 --> 00:04:32.438
<i> and over again.</i>

00:04:32.471 --> 00:04:35.074
<i> And they're like,
 William, enough kissing, okay?</i>

00:04:35.107 --> 00:04:37.276
<i> We only have time
 to shoot this one more time.</i>

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:40.146
<i> And he's like, okay, let's
 just do one without the kiss.</i>

00:04:40.179 --> 00:04:41.814
So it isn't until
the next day

00:04:41.847 --> 00:04:44.050
<i> that they watch the scene
 and see that William Shatner</i>

00:04:44.083 --> 00:04:47.186
<i> crosses his eyes
 to the camera.</i>

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:48.554
<i> And they're like,
 what the [bleep],</i>

00:04:48.587 --> 00:04:50.122
<i> is this really happening?</i>

00:04:50.155 --> 00:04:51.857
<i> And William Shatner was like,
 I guess we either</i>

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.826
<i> have to air
 this interracial kiss</i>

00:04:53.859 --> 00:04:55.594
<i> or not have a scene.</i>

00:04:55.627 --> 00:04:57.296
<i> And that is how
 the first interracial kiss</i>

00:04:57.329 --> 00:04:58.931
<i> gets on television.
 - Wow.</i>

00:04:58.964 --> 00:05:02.468 line:0%
<i> - And then, in 1969,
 America lands on the Moon.</i>

00:05:02.501 --> 00:05:03.936
<i> And everyone in America's
 like, oh, my God,</i>

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:05.404
<i> we landed on the Moon.
 It's amazing.</i>

00:05:05.437 --> 00:05:07.306
<i> And Nichelle was like,
 uh, hold up,</i>

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:08.641
<i> that's all white dudes.</i>

00:05:08.674 --> 00:05:09.909
<i> What the [bleep], right?</i>

00:05:09.942 --> 00:05:11.444
<i> So she gives this big speech,</i>

00:05:11.477 --> 00:05:14.280
<i> and she's like,
 NASA, get your shit together.</i>

00:05:14.313 --> 00:05:17.083
<i> Can you please recruit
 someone to be an astronaut</i>

00:05:17.116 --> 00:05:18.751
<i> who's not a white dude?</i>

00:05:18.784 --> 00:05:21.921
<i> And NASA's like, okay, cool,
 but, like, can you do it?</i>

00:05:21.954 --> 00:05:25.024
<i> 'Cause we don't know anybody
 who's not a white dude.</i>

00:05:25.057 --> 00:05:26.892
<i> So Nichelle Nichols was like,</i>

00:05:26.925 --> 00:05:29.929
<i> ugh, black ladies
 have to do everything.</i>

00:05:29.962 --> 00:05:31.697
So she travels
around the country,

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:33.232
<i> and she recruits
 people to be in NASA,</i>

00:05:33.265 --> 00:05:34.767
<i> and she's like,
 hey, black people,</i>

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.103
<i> Asians, lady people,
 do you wanna go to space?</i>

00:05:37.136 --> 00:05:38.537
<i> And they're like, okay, cool.</i>

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.239 line:0%
<i> And she recruited Sally Ride.</i>

00:05:40.272 --> 00:05:42.908 line:0%
<i> And then, she recruits
 Colonel Bluford.</i>

00:05:42.941 --> 00:05:45.311 line:0%
<i> He was the first black dude
 to be in NASA.</i>

00:05:45.344 --> 00:05:46.712 line:0%
<i> - How cool is that?</i>

00:05:46.745 --> 00:05:48.481 line:0%
<i> - And then,
 she recruited Mae Jemison.</i>

00:05:48.514 --> 00:05:51.083 line:0%
<i> And she was like, hey,
 you should apply for NASA.</i>

00:05:51.116 --> 00:05:53.319
<i> And Mae Jemison
 is like, oh, my God,</i>

00:05:53.352 --> 00:05:55.087
<i> you were on "Star Trek."
 I love you.</i>

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.390
<i> But she's like, pay attention.</i>

00:05:57.423 --> 00:05:58.824
So Nichelle Nichols was, like,

00:05:58.857 --> 00:06:01.127
<i> the first black lady
 to go to space for fake,</i>

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.895
<i> and she recruited
 the first black lady</i>

00:06:02.928 --> 00:06:04.196
<i> to go to space for real.</i>

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:07.400
<i> She literally
 integrated space.</i>

00:06:07.433 --> 00:06:10.503
Everybody who's
really good at math,

00:06:10.536 --> 00:06:12.171
or whatever
you have to be good at

00:06:12.204 --> 00:06:14.039
to be--go to NASA,

00:06:14.072 --> 00:06:15.741
can do whatever they wanna do.

00:06:15.774 --> 00:06:18.544
- But we still need to prosper

00:06:18.577 --> 00:06:20.413
