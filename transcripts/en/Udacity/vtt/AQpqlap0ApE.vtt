00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.485
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Remember that if we multiply these two binomials together, we get a general

00:00:04.485 --> 00:00:08.885
answer of x squared plus the quantity a plus b times x plus ab. So a plus b, we

00:00:08.885 --> 00:00:13.484
can see, is the coefficient of an x to the first term, which in the expression

00:00:13.484 --> 00:00:18.467
that we're trying to match is 8. So a plus b equals 8. Now a times b shows up in

00:00:18.467 --> 00:00:24.162
the constant term of this expression, which in the expression we're going for is

00:00:24.162 --> 00:00:26.068
15. So a times b equals 15.
