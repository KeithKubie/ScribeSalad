00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.790
- [Voiceover] In the video on
the auto-ionization of water

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.790
we saw that you could have
two neutral water molecules,

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.650
but one of them could swipe
a hydrogen ion from the other

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.490
and then you could be
left with a hydronium ion,

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.150
and the one that had the
hydrogen ion swiped from it,

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.550
remember a hydrogen ion
is really just a proton.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.420
This one actually gains an electron,

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.420
it gains an electron from that hydrogen.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.250
It takes all the electrons
from this covalent bond,

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.120
right over here, and it
forms another lone pair

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.390
and it gets a negative charge,

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.790
and that becomes a hydroxide ion.

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.520
Or we could also describe that
auto-ionization like this,

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.110
that if I have one water molecule,

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.820
well the oxygen grabs
both of the electrons

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.120
from this lone pair,

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.490
swipes hydrogen of the
one electron it had,

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.420
and all it's left with is its protons.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.990
Well, hydrogen ion, it's really
just talking about a proton

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:52.950
because the most common
isotope of hydrogen

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.420
only has a proton in it's nucleus,

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.690
it does not have a neutron.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:57.890
So you take away its electron,

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.050
you just have that proton left.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.620
And the whole point of doing this to show,

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.150
well look, its not going
to be a typical thing,

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.390
most of the water molecules
aren't going to be doing this,

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.390
but this is going to happen

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.450
if you have a large enough
quantity of water molecules.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.920
And we've even seen to
what degree that happens,

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.220
how typical that is by
looking at the concentration.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.550
If we looked at the concentration,

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.950
so if we're talking about pure water,

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.420
we've seen that the concentration,

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.890
and we can think about it in two ways.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.810
If we think about this top way

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.590
of expressing the auto-ionization,

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.810
we can say the concentration
of hydronium ions,

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.090
or if we think about this one over here,

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.950
we could think about the
concentration of hydrogen ions.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.590
And the reason why these
two things are equivalent,

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.050
is because these hydrogen ions

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:42.690
are really just going
to associate themselves

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.690
with the water molecule
and become hydronium.

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.120
But in pure water, at 25 degrees Celsius,

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.750
we've seen that these are
going to be approximately

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.420
the concentration, whether you think of it

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.790
as hydronium concentration or
hydrogen ion concentration,

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.490
it's going to be
approximately one times ten

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.350
to the negative seven molar.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.520
What does that mean?

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.720
Well molar, this is just
the units for molarity,

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.690
that's the same thing as one times ten

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.690
to the negative seven
moles, moles per liter.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.420
If you have trouble
remembering what moles are,

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.890
first of all I encourage
you to watch that video

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.220
on Kahn Academy on moles.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.020
But, we just have to remind
ourselves it's a quanity.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.650
Just as a dozen means twelve of something,

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.190
a mole of something means 6.022 times,

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.190
and roughly 6.022 times 10
to the 23rd of that thing.

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.820
So it's just a very,
very, very large quanity.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.120
So that's the concentration,
that you could say

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.520
the hydrogen ion concentration

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.550
in pure water at 25 degrees Celsius.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.320
But, we could ask ourselves
that same question

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.250
for other types of solutions.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.420
For example, orange juice.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.890
So let's just say right over here,

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.290
so in orange juice,

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.888
the hydrogen ion concentration,

00:02:52.888 --> 00:02:54.158
and once again I could also say

00:02:54.158 --> 00:02:56.518
this is a hydronium concentration.

00:02:56.518 --> 00:02:57.958
Depending on your glass of orange juice,

00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.688
it wouldn't be atypical to find a glass

00:02:59.688 --> 00:03:02.318
that has a hydrogen ion concentration

00:03:02.318 --> 00:03:07.318
of say one times ten to
the negative 3.5 molar.

00:03:08.388 --> 00:03:11.658
So once again, this is
actually a lot more then this,

00:03:11.658 --> 00:03:13.218
actually let me make it a round number,

00:03:13.218 --> 00:03:14.758
you actually might be
able to find something

00:03:14.758 --> 00:03:18.858
at one times ten to the
negative four molar.

00:03:18.858 --> 00:03:20.258
I looked it up on the internet,

00:03:20.258 --> 00:03:22.918
there's actually a range
kind of in the mid threes

00:03:22.918 --> 00:03:27.318
to low fours of hydrogen ion
concentration for orange juice.

00:03:27.318 --> 00:03:28.688
So you could find something like this,

00:03:28.688 --> 00:03:30.958
and as you can tell, it's
good to always just think

00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.358
about the numbers, this is actually

00:03:32.358 --> 00:03:35.518
a much higher concentration
than this over here.

00:03:35.518 --> 00:03:38.558
The exponent over here is less negative,

00:03:38.558 --> 00:03:40.288
so this is a higher concentration,

00:03:40.288 --> 00:03:44.038
so this is a higher concentration.

00:03:45.418 --> 00:03:48.488
We could look at something
that has a lower concentration.

00:03:48.488 --> 00:03:50.218
Say something like bleach.

00:03:50.218 --> 00:03:54.988
So bleach, I'll write
that right over here,

00:03:54.988 --> 00:03:57.288
I actually looked it up
on the Clorox website.

00:03:57.288 --> 00:03:58.188
The Clorox bleach,

00:03:58.188 --> 00:04:00.118
they say that their
hydrogen ion concentration

00:04:00.118 --> 00:04:04.488
is approximately - so their
hydrogen ion concentration -

00:04:04.488 --> 00:04:08.888
is approximately equal to one times ten

00:04:08.888 --> 00:04:13.888
to the negative twelve molar.

00:04:14.388 --> 00:04:16.658
So this is a much lower concentration

00:04:16.658 --> 00:04:19.988
than you would have in
just water right over here,

00:04:19.988 --> 00:04:22.018
in pure water at 25 degrees Celsius.

00:04:22.018 --> 00:04:23.858
So this is a much lower concentration,

00:04:23.858 --> 00:04:26.588
this exponent over here is more negative.

00:04:26.588 --> 00:04:29.058
This is a lower concentration.

00:04:29.058 --> 00:04:30.718
Well this is all well and good,

00:04:30.718 --> 00:04:33.388
but it can get a little bulky
talking about concentrations

00:04:33.388 --> 00:04:35.958
in terms of the scientific notation,

00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:38.818
something times something to
the negative whatever molar.

00:04:38.818 --> 00:04:40.518
So to help simplify that,

00:04:40.518 --> 00:04:44.458
people have invented the idea of a pH.

00:04:44.458 --> 00:04:46.918
Let me introduce it in a color

00:04:46.918 --> 00:04:48.488
that I have not used yet before.

00:04:48.488 --> 00:04:51.558
You use lowercase p, uppercase h.

00:04:51.558 --> 00:04:55.358
I've looked into where
this notation comes from,

00:04:55.358 --> 00:04:57.958
the h most people agree is
referring to the hydrogen

00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.818
in some way, but the p some people think

00:04:59.818 --> 00:05:01.658
is referring to potential,
some people just think

00:05:01.658 --> 00:05:03.618
it's a random letter
that was associated in

00:05:03.618 --> 00:05:05.458
with one of these historical artifacts.

00:05:05.458 --> 00:05:09.158
But, this is defined
as the negative log of,

00:05:09.158 --> 00:05:12.188
and we could say negative
log, if we don't write a base,

00:05:12.188 --> 00:05:13.858
you assume it's base 10.

00:05:13.858 --> 00:05:18.088
But, the negative log of the
hydrogen ion concentration,

00:05:18.088 --> 00:05:20.458
or it's equivalently the negative log,

00:05:20.458 --> 00:05:25.458
because the hydrogen ions are
really hydronium ions, H3O.

00:05:26.588 --> 00:05:29.488
It's really the same
thing as this as well.

00:05:29.488 --> 00:05:32.988
So given this definition of pH,

00:05:32.988 --> 00:05:35.658
let's calculate the pH's for pure water

00:05:35.658 --> 00:05:36.958
at 25 degrees Celsius,

00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:40.018
the pH of this glass of orange juice,

00:05:40.018 --> 00:05:42.158
or the pH of this bleach.

00:05:42.158 --> 00:05:44.858
Well, the pH of this pure
water is going to be,

00:05:44.858 --> 00:05:49.858
so the pH here, so I have
some space right over here,

00:05:52.988 --> 00:05:54.748
it's going to be the negative log,

00:05:54.748 --> 00:05:57.388
and I'll write the base 10
there just cause that's assumed,

00:05:57.388 --> 00:05:59.258
of its hydrogen ion concentration,

00:05:59.258 --> 00:06:01.588
which is one times ten to
the negative seven molar.

00:06:01.588 --> 00:06:03.358
We want molarity right over here,

00:06:03.358 --> 00:06:04.858
you want molarity right over here.

00:06:04.858 --> 00:06:06.488
Well, one times ten to the negative seven

00:06:06.488 --> 00:06:09.658
is the same thing as
ten to the negative 7,

00:06:09.658 --> 00:06:12.988
and if you look at just the
part where the log here,

00:06:12.988 --> 00:06:15.288
before we think about the negative.

00:06:15.288 --> 00:06:17.288
This is just saying to what
power do we have to raise ten,

00:06:17.288 --> 00:06:19.418
to get ten to the negative seven power?

00:06:19.418 --> 00:06:21.258
Well, that's just going
to be negative seven.

00:06:21.258 --> 00:06:23.218
If what I just did is confusing,

00:06:23.218 --> 00:06:25.858
I encourage you to review
logarithms on Khan Academy.

00:06:25.858 --> 00:06:28.788
So we're going to have the
negative of negative seven,

00:06:28.788 --> 00:06:33.788
which is going to be
equal to positive seven.

00:06:34.088 --> 00:06:38.218
So the pH of pure water
at 25 degrees Celsius,

00:06:38.218 --> 00:06:39.258
and temperature would matter

00:06:39.258 --> 00:06:41.458
because it might affect auto-ionization.

00:06:41.458 --> 00:06:44.854
The pH at 25 degrees celsius is seven.

00:06:44.854 --> 00:06:46.518
What about this orange juice?

00:06:46.518 --> 00:06:51.518
Well the pH over here is going
to be the negative log of -

00:06:54.258 --> 00:06:56.288
Instead of writing one times
ten to the negative four,

00:06:56.288 --> 00:06:58.488
I can just write ten to the negative four,

00:06:58.488 --> 00:07:00.418
and of course that's a base 10.

00:07:00.418 --> 00:07:02.358
Well, what do I have to raise ten to,

00:07:02.358 --> 00:07:03.558
to get ten to the negative four,

00:07:03.558 --> 00:07:05.288
well I'll have to raise that
to the negative four power.

00:07:05.288 --> 00:07:08.358
The negative of negative
four is positive four.

00:07:08.358 --> 00:07:12.418
By that same argument, or by
applying the same definition,

00:07:12.418 --> 00:07:16.458
the pH of this bleach is going to be equal

00:07:16.458 --> 00:07:20.758
to the negative log of ten
to the negative twelve.

00:07:20.758 --> 00:07:22.788
I'm just ignoring this
one times right over here,

00:07:22.788 --> 00:07:24.388
I could write one times
ten to the negative twelve,

00:07:24.388 --> 00:07:26.018
but that's not going to change its value.

00:07:26.018 --> 00:07:28.618
That of course is going to
be equal to the negative

00:07:28.618 --> 00:07:33.318
of negative twelve,
which is positive twelve.

00:07:33.318 --> 00:07:36.058
So it might be fun to plot all of these.

00:07:36.058 --> 00:07:37.358
Let me do that.

00:07:37.358 --> 00:07:40.088
So let me plot these pH's.

00:07:40.088 --> 00:07:45.088
So we draw a line right over here,

00:07:45.458 --> 00:07:50.458
and let's say that this is
zero, one, two, three, four -

00:07:53.858 --> 00:07:56.178
which I'm not gonna be able
to all the way to twelve,

00:07:56.178 --> 00:07:58.618
so I'll have to make my
scale a little bit smaller.

00:07:58.618 --> 00:08:03.618
Zero, one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine,

00:08:07.258 --> 00:08:12.258
ten, eleven, twelve, and I
could keep going over here.

00:08:12.388 --> 00:08:16.758
So let me write this, one,
two, three, four, five, six,

00:08:16.758 --> 00:08:21.588
seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.

00:08:21.588 --> 00:08:23.918
So these are our pH's over
here, I could plot em.

00:08:23.918 --> 00:08:26.718
That water at 25 degrees Celsius

00:08:26.718 --> 00:08:30.618
is gonna be right over
here, and that is my water.

00:08:30.618 --> 00:08:33.388
That's sometimes referred
to as a neutral pH.

00:08:33.388 --> 00:08:36.258
If I look at that orange
juice with a pH of four,

00:08:36.258 --> 00:08:38.558
that orange juice is
gonna be right over here,

00:08:38.558 --> 00:08:40.218
and I've seen ranges for orange juice,

00:08:40.218 --> 00:08:42.888
that's actually more in
this range right over here,

00:08:42.888 --> 00:08:44.958
so depending on your glass, or
whether it's gone bad or not,

00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.318
so that's going to be orange juice,

00:08:47.318 --> 00:08:48.688
could be found in that range.

00:08:48.688 --> 00:08:53.688
So I'll write orange juice, orange juice.

00:08:53.888 --> 00:08:55.218
And then this bleach,

00:08:55.218 --> 00:08:58.088
and it depends on the
concentration and all of that,

00:08:58.088 --> 00:09:01.288
but this bleach in particular
is right over here,

00:09:01.288 --> 00:09:03.458
this bleach is right over here.

00:09:03.458 --> 00:09:05.758
I could plot other things, your stomach,

00:09:05.758 --> 00:09:08.258
the juices in your stomach,
are highly, highly -

00:09:08.258 --> 00:09:11.158
well I'll talk about the
acidic a little bit more -

00:09:11.158 --> 00:09:15.218
but your stomach juices are going to be -

00:09:15.218 --> 00:09:18.558
let me do this in a new color -

00:09:18.558 --> 00:09:23.058
are going to be in this
range right over here.

00:09:23.058 --> 00:09:28.058
So stomach acid, and often
instead of stomach juices,

00:09:28.418 --> 00:09:30.088
stomach acid.

00:09:30.088 --> 00:09:32.058
If you had something like seawater,

00:09:32.058 --> 00:09:37.058
it's going to be in this range,
right over here, seawater.

00:09:40.158 --> 00:09:42.658
Now let's think about
what this is telling us,

00:09:42.658 --> 00:09:44.818
and remember this is a logarithmic scale,

00:09:44.818 --> 00:09:49.818
as we go to the right, our
concentration is going down,

00:09:54.158 --> 00:09:55.118
it's important to recognize,

00:09:55.118 --> 00:09:57.688
and that's all because of
this negative right over here,

00:09:57.688 --> 00:09:58.818
in our definition.

00:09:58.818 --> 00:10:01.818
But we saw that bleach has
a much lower concentration

00:10:01.818 --> 00:10:03.518
than the water has.

00:10:03.518 --> 00:10:08.518
So this is lower hydrogen
ion concentration.

00:10:08.818 --> 00:10:10.718
As we go to the left we have

00:10:10.718 --> 00:10:13.618
a higher hydrogen ion concentration.

00:10:13.618 --> 00:10:16.618
Higher hydrogen ion concentration.

00:10:16.618 --> 00:10:19.288
In general, if something
has a pH below seven,

00:10:19.288 --> 00:10:23.018
we tend to refer to it as acidic.

00:10:23.018 --> 00:10:25.918
We say it is acidic.

00:10:25.918 --> 00:10:29.658
So typically when you add
acids to neutral water,

00:10:29.658 --> 00:10:31.888
your pH is going to go down,

00:10:31.888 --> 00:10:34.258
it's going to get more and more acidic.

00:10:34.258 --> 00:10:37.058
As you go to the right, if
you have a pH above seven,

00:10:37.058 --> 00:10:40.658
sometimes you'll hear people say basic

00:10:40.658 --> 00:10:43.818
and sometimes you also might
hear people say alkaline.

00:10:43.818 --> 00:10:47.088
It is becoming more alkaline,

00:10:47.088 --> 00:10:50.018
it's hydrogen concentration
is getting lower,

00:10:50.018 --> 00:10:53.918
and lower, and lower as
we move to the right.

00:10:53.918 --> 00:10:56.378
I really want you to appreciate
the logarithmic nature of it

00:10:56.378 --> 00:10:58.118
because if I handed you some seawater

00:10:58.118 --> 00:11:01.518
with a pH of eight, you
might say okay no big deal

00:11:01.518 --> 00:11:04.388
pH of eight relative to a pH of seven,

00:11:04.388 --> 00:11:06.358
but this is a logarithmic scale,

00:11:06.358 --> 00:11:07.688
if we're moving to the right,

00:11:07.688 --> 00:11:12.688
we have a ten times lower
concentration of hydrogen ions.

00:11:13.258 --> 00:11:16.818
If we were to move three
spaces to the right on this,

00:11:16.818 --> 00:11:20.358
where it's one-tenth,
one-tenth, one-tenth,

00:11:20.358 --> 00:11:24.358
we have one-thousandth the
concentration of hydrogen ions.

00:11:24.358 --> 00:11:26.018
It's pretty interesting to think about

00:11:26.018 --> 00:11:31.018
how much lower the hydrogen
concentration is in say bleach

00:11:31.288 --> 00:11:33.118
than in water, and how much lower that is

00:11:33.118 --> 00:11:37.117
than say stomach acid or orange juice.
