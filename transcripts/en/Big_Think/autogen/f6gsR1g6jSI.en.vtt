should be able to buy weapons so easily

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:02.949
should be able to buy weapons so easily
 

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:05.759
should be able to buy weapons so easily
without common-sense checks and the like

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769
without common-sense checks and the like
 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:07.979

in that we should be doing something

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940
in that we should be doing something
 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.920

about it because I fear that the these

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930
about it because I fear that the these
 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.240
about it because I fear that the these
mass shootings make it worse that will

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250

have more bloodshed and more violence
until we come around to the

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:21.639
until we come around to the
 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:23.430
until we come around to the
understanding that we should be doing

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440
understanding that we should be doing
 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.130
understanding that we should be doing
the common-sense gun safety things that

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.140
