00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.880
Now that we've set up
the parametrization,

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.680
let's try to evaluate
the integral.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.430
And the next thing
we'll do is essentially

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.910
try to express ds right over
here in terms of du and dv.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:14.170
And we've seen this before.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:19.160
ds is going to be equal to the
magnitude of the cross product

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.470
of the partial of r with
respect to u crossed

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.270
with the partial of r
with respect to v du dv.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.980
So first, let's take
the cross product,

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.580
and we'll do that
with a 3 by 3 matrix.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.960
I'll do that right over here.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.630
We set up, and I'll just kind
of fill in what r sub u and r

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.310
sub v is in the actual
determinant right over here.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:50.560
So first we have our
components, i, j, and k.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.450
And now first, let's
think about what

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.852
r sub u is, the partial
of r with respect to u.

00:00:58.852 --> 00:01:01.570
Well, its i component
is going to be 1.

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.800
The partial of u with
respect to u is just 1,

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.980
so its i component is 1.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.690
Its j component
is going to be 0,

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.490
partial of v with
respect to u is

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.990
0. v does not change
with respect to u,

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.010
so this is going to be 0.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.680
This should be
parentheses around here.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.470
Partial of this with respect to
u is just going to be 1 again.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.150
The partial of v squared
with respect to u is just 0.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.420
So this is just 1 again.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.860
And then r sub v, the partial
of r with respect to v,

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.020
the i component
is going to be 0,

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.980
j component is going to
be 1, and the partial

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:42.530
of u plus v squared with
respect to v is going to be 2v.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.360
So it's a pretty
straightforward determinant,

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.540
so let's try to evaluate it.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.275
So the i component,
it's going to be i.

00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:52.160
So we cross out this
column, this row.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.170
It's going to be 0 times
2v minus 1 times 1.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.800
So essentially, it's just
going to be negative 1 times i.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.610
So we're going to
have negative i,

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.010
so this is equal to negative i.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.748
And then the j
component-- and we're

00:02:07.748 --> 00:02:10.289
going to have to put a negative
out front, because, remember,

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.930
we do that checkerboard pattern.

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.000
So cross out that
row, that column.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.474
1 times 2v is 2v.

00:02:16.474 --> 00:02:17.640
Let me make sure I got that.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.660
1 times 2v is 2v
minus 0 times 1.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.230
So it's just going to be 2v.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.709
But since it was the
j component, which

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.000
is going to be negative, it's
going to be negative 2vj.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.290
Let me make sure
I did that right.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.820
That column, that row, 1
times 2v is 2v minus 0 is 2v.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.390
The checkerboard pattern,
you'd have a negative j.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.800
So you have negative 2vj.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.900
And then we have
find the k component.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.110
Cross out that row, that
column, 1 times 1 minus 0.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.390
So it's going to be plus k.

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.996
So if we want the
magnitude of this,

00:02:52.996 --> 00:02:55.400
this whole thing right
over here is just

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.070
going to be the
square root-- I'm just

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:01.780
taking the magnitude
of this part right

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.060
over here, the
actual cross product.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.980
It's going to be
negative 1 squared, which

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.320
is just 1, plus negative
2v squared, which

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.810
is 4v squared, plus 1
squared, which is just 1.

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.230
So this whole thing
is going to evaluate

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:29.700
to-- we have 2 plus
2v squared du dv.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.807
Or actually, let me-- I
almost made a mistake.

00:03:31.807 --> 00:03:33.140
That would have been a disaster.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:39.940
2 plus 4v squared du dv.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.690
And if we want,
maybe it'll help us

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.630
a little bit if we factor
out a 2 right over here.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:54.580
This is the same thing as 2
times 1 plus 2v squared du dv.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.650
If you factor out
the 2, you get this

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:03.960
is equal to the square root of
2 times the square root of 1

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.670
plus 2v squared du dv.

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.550
And I now think we are ready to
evaluate the surface integral.

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.090
So let's do it.

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.250
All right.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.168
So let me just write
this thing down here.

00:04:18.168 --> 00:04:20.459
So I'm going to write everything
that has to do with v,

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.410
I'm going to write in purple.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.620
So I'm just going to write
the ds part right over here.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:32.310
It is the square root of 2
times the square root of 1

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.960
plus 2v squared.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.040
And then we're going
to have du, which

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:46.170
I'll write in green,
du, and then dv.

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.210
So this is just the ds part.

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.290
This is just the ds.

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.370
Now, we have the
y right over here.

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.260
y is just equal to v. All right,
so I'll write that in purple.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:00.430
So y is just equal to v. That is
y-- let me make it very clear--

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:05.360
and all of this is ds.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.010
And now I can write the
bounds in terms of u

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:12.225
and v. And so the u part,
u is the same thing as x.

00:05:12.225 --> 00:05:16.400
It goes between 0 and 1.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.860
And then v, v is
the same thing as y,

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.720
and y goes between, or
v goes between, 0 and 2.

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.210
And I now think we're
ready to evaluate.

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.384
And the u and v variables
are not so mixed up,

00:05:33.384 --> 00:05:35.550
so we can actually separate
out these two integrals,

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.020
make this a product of
two single integrals.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.966
The first thing, if we look
at it with respect to du,

00:05:40.966 --> 00:05:44.500
all this stuff in purple is just
a constant with respect to u,

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.060
so we can take it out
of the du integral.

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.050
We can take all this purple
stuff out of this du integral.

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.980
And so this double integral
simplifies to the integral

00:05:53.980 --> 00:06:00.750
from 0 to 2 of-- I'll write it
as the square root of 2v times

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:05.750
the square root of
1 plus 2v squared.

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:09.050
So I factored out
all of this stuff.

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:16.110
And then you have times the
integral from 0 to 1 du,

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:22.460
and then times d,
and then you have dv.

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.960
And now, if this was really
complicated, I could say,

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.910
OK, this is just going
to be a function of u.

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:28.370
It's a constant
with respect to v.

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:29.860
And you could factor
this whole thing out

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:30.810
and separate the integrals.

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:31.810
But this is even easier.

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:35.130
This integral is just
going to evaluate to 1.

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:37.660
So this whole thing
just evaluates to 1.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.930
And so we've simplified this
into one single integral.

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:43.330
So this simplifies
to-- and I could even

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.820
take the square root of 2
out front-- the square root

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:50.050
of 2 times the integral
from v is equal to 0 to v

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:54.890
is equal to 2 of v
times the square root

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:59.600
of 1 plus 2v squared dv.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.430
And so we really are
in the home stretch

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:03.630
of evaluating this
surface integral.

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:05.280
And here, this is basic.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.360
This is actually a little
bit of u substitution

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.910
that we can do in our head.

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:11.950
If you have a function, or
kind of this embedded function

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:14.030
right over here,
1 plus 2v squared,

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:16.960
what's the derivative
of 1 plus 2v squared?

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.370
Well, it would be 4v.

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.530
And we have something
almost 4v here.

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:24.490
We can make this 4v by
multiplying it by 4 here,

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:26.420
and then dividing
it by 4 out here.

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:28.790
This doesn't change the
value of the integral.

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:30.990
And so now this part
right over here,

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:34.340
it's pretty straightforward
to take the antiderivative.

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:36.810
The antiderivative
of this is going

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:41.530
to be-- we have this embedded
function's derivative right

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:45.360
over here, so we can kind of
just treat it like an x or a v.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.860
Take the antiderivative
with respect

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:48.670
to this thing right
over here, and we

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:52.910
get this is essentially 1 plus
2v squared to the 1/2 power.

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:56.930
We increment it by
1, so it's 1 plus 2v

00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:59.840
squared to the 3/2 power.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:04.270
And then you divide by 3/2,
or you multiply by 2/3,

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:07.680
so times 2/3.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.292
So this is the
antiderivative of that.

00:08:10.292 --> 00:08:12.500
And then, of course, you
still have all of this stuff

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:20.620
out front-- square
root of 2 over 4

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:27.929
And we are going to
evaluate this from 0 to 2.

00:08:27.929 --> 00:08:30.470
And actually, just to simplify
it, let me factor out the 2/3.

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:33.440
We don't have to worry
about that at 2 and 0.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:37.201
So I'm going to factor out
the 2/3, so times 2 over 3.

00:08:37.201 --> 00:08:38.659
And actually, this
will cancel out.

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:40.120
That becomes a 1.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.020
That becomes a 2.

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:47.900
And so we are left-- this
stuff over here is 1/6 times.

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:51.790
And now if you evaluate this
at 2, you have 2v squared.

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:55.240
That's going to be 2
times 4 is 8 plus 1

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:58.930
is 9, 9 to the 3/2 power.

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:02.340
So 9 to the 1/2 is 3,
3 to the 3rd is 27.

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:06.110
So it's going to be equal to 27.

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:08.050
And then minus this
thing evaluated at 0.

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:10.305
Well, this evaluated at
0 is just going to be 1.

00:09:10.305 --> 00:09:14.110
1 to the 3/2 is
just 1, so minus 1.

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:16.730
And so this gives us-- oh,
I almost made a mistake.

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:20.260
There should be a square
root of 2 up here,

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:24.330
square root of 2 over
6 times 27 minus 1.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.090
So drum roll.

00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:28.700
This gives us the value of
our surface integral is,

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:32.130
let's see, 27 minus 1 is 26.

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:36.872
So we get 26 times the
square root of 2 over 6.

00:09:36.872 --> 00:09:38.580
And we can simplify
it a little bit more.

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:41.020
Divide the numerator
and denominator by 2,

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:48.050
and you get 13 square
roots of 2 over 3.

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:51.070
And we are done.
