1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.893
More personal.

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.850
Hey I'm Jad Abumrad This is more perfect today two stories from reporter

3
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:07.103
Catherine wells.

4
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.830
The first has some adult content in it so be warned if you listening with kids

5
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.150
you might wanna skip this one. Here's Catherine.

6
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.390
<v 1>So maybe we can start with the the night that it started. Yeah.</v>

7
00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:18.750
So we didn't start with a start.

8
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.460
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

9
00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.100
<v 2>So give me the who what when where the best way to describe being on patrol</v>

10
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.040
officer on the street is you have a front row seat to the Greatest Show on

11
00:00:29.041 --> 00:00:29.610
Earth.

12
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.610
<v 3>September 17th 1998 on the outskirts of Houston there's a deputy sheriff named</v>

13
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.040
Joseph Quinn had been on duty very long at all.

14
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.230
<v 4>He's driving around and he hears this call go out the radio priority call</v>

15
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.910
somebody is called in and said There's a man gone crazy with a gun in an

16
00:00:47.911 --> 00:00:48.744
apartment.

17
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.240
He happens to be driving right by the apartment complex.

18
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.150
<v 2>Pretty familiar with the complex. I knew where the building was.</v>

19
00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.790
<v 4>So he's like Hey I got this I'm right here I'm going home.</v>

20
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.750
So I parked and I tried to be as tactical as I could listen and see if I hear

21
00:01:03.751 --> 00:01:05.100
any kind of sound to distinguish.

22
00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.610
<v 5>Walked into the breezeway on high alert senses heightened adrenaline pumping</v>

23
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.770
and out in the middle courtyard.

24
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.690
<v 6>There was a gentleman standing out there as soon as he saw me.</v>

25
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.960
<v 7>He started yelling Over here over here I can telling you I was upset he was</v>

26
00:01:26.961 --> 00:01:31.100
crying. He said he's up there he's up there I said Up where.

27
00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.180
<v 4>And he points up to this apartment on the second floor.</v>

28
00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.240
<v 2>I said the man with a gun is up there.</v>

29
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.010
Is that where you're saying that apartment right there. He said Yeah.

30
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.780
<v 4>So a couple other officers arrive and they get information.</v>

31
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.140
<v 6>We took our time control your breathing to get that</v>

32
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.090
you know the adrenaline rush and the blood pressure down to where you don't get

33
00:01:50.091 --> 00:01:50.924
tunnel vision.

34
00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.160
<v 7>Went up the stairs for us.</v>

35
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.920
<v 8>When they get up to the top of the stairs got to the apartment door and their</v>

36
00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.820
door was ajar it was open. I listened for a second

37
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.870
game to get in and find that I could detect anything in the apartment.

38
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.640
So we got ready and I pushed the door open all the way open.

39
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.270
<v 9>I announced our presence the sheriff's department anyone in the apartment come</v>

40
00:02:20.271 --> 00:02:21.510
out where we could see you.

41
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.150
<v 10>Keep your hands in plain sight.</v>

42
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.980
I did this two or three times very loudly. Still no response.

43
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.110
<v 11>There is a bedroom in the back of the apartment.</v>

44
00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.020
<v 12>It was a door to a back bedroom that was closed.</v>

45
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.170
<v 3>And these two officers start walking towards it.</v>

46
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.860
<v 13>The deputy that was in front of me.</v>

47
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
He opened the door pushed it open and as soon as he did he lurched back like he

48
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:49.463
would startle.

49
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.180
<v 14>So he goes into the bedroom finger's on the trigger pressure fold if I see a gun</v>

50
00:02:55.181 --> 00:02:59.110
and it's pointed at me. I'm gonna take him out. But then. It's like.

51
00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.410
<v 15>You got to be kidding me. Really.</v>

52
00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.400
What was it. What was it. It was. Two guys having sex.

53
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.680
Oh something I'll never forget. I mean it's like

54
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.430
I just I was just flabbergasted.

55
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:19.990
<v 4>Okay so here's the story.</v>

56
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.830
The two guys that were in the apartment where John Lawrence and Tyrone Garner

57
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.500
John was an older white guy. He was in his 50s.

58
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.100
And Tyrone was a younger black guy in his thirties.

59
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.870
<v 2>Come to find out. Basically the gentleman downstairs.</v>

60
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.990
This is the guy who called nine one one was former lover or on again off again

61
00:03:37.061 --> 00:03:42.061
lover one and he was upset that the other that they were engaged in some kind of

62
00:03:42.071 --> 00:03:42.940
activity was OK.

63
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.490
<v 4>So the guy in the parking lot was the boyfriend of Tehran.</v>

64
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.840
And we don't really know why he called 9 1 1 but the thought is that maybe he

65
00:03:52.631 --> 00:03:56.470
was jealous of whatever was going on in the apartment and he decided he wanted

66
00:03:56.471 --> 00:03:57.250
to get them in trouble.

67
00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.200
<v 9>You know it was a lover's triangle kind of thing.</v>

68
00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.260
<v 4>So you know the cops come in and John and Tyrone have no idea what's going on.</v>

69
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.630
They didn't know that the boyfriend had gone and called 9 1 1 so they're

70
00:04:07.631 --> 00:04:10.360
shocked. And Quinn says they start yelling at him.

71
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.380
<v 9>Just I mean combative belligerent refusing to comply with anything we hated gays</v>

72
00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.150
we were homophobes we were jackbooted Nazi thugs.

73
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.500
So at a certain point Quinn just decides you know if we leave him here and the

74
00:04:23.501 --> 00:04:26.260
way they're acting and they're intoxicated we're going to have further calls

75
00:04:26.261 --> 00:04:30.460
here. Know it's not and if we leave them here we decide to arrest them.

76
00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.840
<v 4>Really what's on what charge. I mean they're just in their house. Right.</v>

77
00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:35.890
So that's the question.

78
00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.600
<v 2>Well I've been a Coleman for 15 years and you know I'm blessed with the ability</v>

79
00:04:40.601 --> 00:04:43.540
to have somewhat of what you would call a photographic memory.

80
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.730
<v 4>Meaning he knew the penal code really well.</v>

81
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:51.100
So he starts thinking he starts going through all the possible laws that could

82
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.770
apply to this and he lands on this one.

83
00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:57.460
<v 12>I know it pretty well twenty one o say statute 21 06.</v>

84
00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.270
<v 9>It says Members of the same sex can engage in sexual conduct.</v>

85
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.150
<v 4>It's a law banning sodomy deviant sexual intercourse.</v>

86
00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.470
<v 16>We were not even treated like civilized citizens.</v>

87
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.910
<v 4>This is John Lawrence from an interview he did with Lambda Legal in 2008.</v>

88
00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.400
It's one of the few bits of tape that we have of him.

89
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.530
<v 17>This is all of a sudden we're taking you downtown.</v>

90
00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:25.050
I wasn't allowed to put clothes on. I was handcuffed and dragged downstairs.

91
00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:29.400
<v 9>Officer Joe Quinn has a different version of that story to the main custody</v>

92
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:32.080
afforded him the opportunity to get dressed.

93
00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.940
They refused so we forced him to put some underwear on.

94
00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.120
You know we actually l Elam down to put underwear on them and escort in the

95
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:42.000
Mallee apartment like that because we I mean it was it was a struggle just to

96
00:05:42.001 --> 00:05:43.110
get them to put underwear on.

97
00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:47.130
<v 0>You just jumped for saying whatever happened in that room which Catherine will</v>

98
00:05:47.131 --> 00:05:48.360
go into more in a second.

99
00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:52.860
This moment of two guys supposedly having sex and I mean charged with sodomy.

100
00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.630
It was like a strike of lightning.

101
00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.160
<v 18>It would begin a process that would profoundly reshape America.</v>

102
00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.550
And what's interesting and this is one of the first things that you bump into if

103
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:08.980
you were an idiot about the law which I am.

104
00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.410
And then you try and make a podcast about the law.

105
00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.090
I'm trying to do is that there's often this disconnect.

106
00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:18.610
Like laws are these things that sort of float above us all these beautiful

107
00:06:18.611 --> 00:06:19.444
abstractions.

108
00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:24.520
And yet if you want to challenge law you've got to find a person down here in

109
00:06:24.521 --> 00:06:28.210
the mud whose experience perfectly somehow captures what you feel is wrong with

110
00:06:28.211 --> 00:06:30.700
the law. You've got to find a perfect plaintiff.

111
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:35.440
<v 19>But how do you find that person. What happens if they're not so perfect.</v>

112
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.760
These two stories you're gonna hear are about a particular tactic that sometimes

113
00:06:39.761 --> 00:06:43.840
called test case litigation that I wasn't too aware of before Kathleen's

114
00:06:43.841 --> 00:06:44.674
reporting.

115
00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:48.220
The second story actually touches on a very current case that was just decided a

116
00:06:48.221 --> 00:06:48.970
few days ago.

117
00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:53.680
The case on affirmative action will meet the guy who brought that case who

118
00:06:53.681 --> 00:06:57.550
critics say is basically destroying some of the most iconic civil rights law

119
00:06:57.551 --> 00:06:58.384
from the 60s.

120
00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:03.480
<v 0>But first we'll get back to Catherine wells with the story of a case called</v>

121
00:07:03.481 --> 00:07:06.500
Lawrence v. Texas. OK so come on in.

122
00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:11.760
<v 20>I brought out my Lawrence versus Texas box of stuff.</v>

123
00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:16.490
<v 4>So I went to Houston and I visited a guy named Mitchell KTM.</v>

124
00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:20.520
He's a lawyer there. And he showed me the arrest papers.

125
00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:23.010
<v 20>He had the arrest papers for these two guys C.J.</v>

126
00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:28.040
Lawrence criminal officers observed the defendant engaged in deviant sexual

127
00:07:28.981 --> 00:07:33.750
conduct charged with homosexual conduct. It's right there in writing.

128
00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:37.950
<v 4>Yeah. I mean it's it really is strange to see those words on a piece of paper.</v>

129
00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.290
It seems like such an anachronism. But it was not.

130
00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:44.700
<v 20>That's. And this is dated timber 17th 1998.</v>

131
00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:47.280
<v 4>Now in 1998 a few other things.</v>

132
00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:52.560
Texas wasn't the only state that had this kind of law on the books at least 13

133
00:07:52.561 --> 00:07:54.780
other states also had an anti sodomy law.

134
00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:58.440
<v 21>And it's important to note that you know this law wasn't used very much.</v>

135
00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:02.910
People were not arrested for this law because when would police be present in

136
00:08:02.911 --> 00:08:04.740
your home to observe you having sex.

137
00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:09.000
This is Dale Carpenter I teach constitutional law at SMU Law School.

138
00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:13.890
I mean sodomy laws weren't really about stopping any body from having sex.

139
00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:18.420
They were really about ensuring that we could label people criminal.

140
00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:24.500
It was a label that people could point to so that people who disapproved of

141
00:08:25.501 --> 00:08:29.010
homosexuality could say look that defining act.

142
00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:32.610
<v 22>Of homosexuality a crime.</v>

143
00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:36.690
<v 20>So if it's a crime and you commit the crime well you're a criminal it's a</v>

144
00:08:36.691 --> 00:08:37.830
criminal statute.

145
00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:42.210
<v 4>People can say you're a criminal which then gives the state a legal basis to</v>

146
00:08:42.211 --> 00:08:47.160
justify all sorts of housing discrimination employment discrimination military

147
00:08:47.161 --> 00:08:52.161
in every context it had an effect and many people argued that these laws they

148
00:08:52.281 --> 00:08:57.260
also sent a strong cultural message what's being called gay bashing.

149
00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:01.610
<v 23>But the most recent example here in Houston is better described as a vicious</v>

150
00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:02.370
killing.

151
00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:06.410
<v 4>And this was at a time when the hate crimes in Houston were surprisingly common.</v>

152
00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:11.080
<v 23>Paul Batista 27 years old died after being beaten with a nail studded to buy for</v>

153
00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:15.440
the second senseless killing in the Montrose area in less than three months.

154
00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:19.940
<v 24>It was a lot of blood and was real apparent that he'd been shot. So.</v>

155
00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:24.860
<v 25>To make a long story short the gay rights movement is very eager to repeal that</v>

156
00:09:24.861 --> 00:09:25.694
sodomy law.

157
00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:30.140
<v 11>OK so John and Tyrone were arrested on a Thursday night the next day.</v>

158
00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.030
It so happened that.

159
00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:36.800
<v 26>Because of the location of John Lawrence's apartment the case landed in a</v>

160
00:09:36.801 --> 00:09:40.940
justice of the peace court meaning after Quinn made the arrest the report was

161
00:09:40.941 --> 00:09:42.470
sent to that court for processing.

162
00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:47.710
<v 4>Now this court is mostly deals with traffic it's mostly a traffic court but</v>

163
00:09:48.231 --> 00:09:53.210
there happens to be this clerk in the court who was gay and he couldn't believe

164
00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:56.660
that there that somebody had actually been arrested for homosexual conduct in

165
00:09:56.661 --> 00:09:57.200
their home.

166
00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:01.820
So that night this clerk and his partner go to a bar and they start talking to

167
00:10:01.821 --> 00:10:02.654
the bartender.

168
00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:06.480
<v 25>I believe it was a Friday night. This is Leanne Lewis. He was the bartender.</v>

169
00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:09.350
When I was doing I was a bartender in 1998.

170
00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:13.130
<v 4>So these two guys come in and they tell Lane you're not going to believe what</v>

171
00:10:13.131 --> 00:10:13.660
happened.

172
00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:17.240
<v 27>They said a couple of guys were arrested and charged with sodomy.</v>

173
00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:19.450
<v 25>And Lane was like yeah yeah yeah yeah.</v>

174
00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:22.940
You just can't believe that such a thing happened it's such an unusual

175
00:10:22.941 --> 00:10:25.160
occurrence. But they were like No no it really happened.

176
00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:29.300
<v 28>And Lane said Send me the report Monday morning bright and early.</v>

177
00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:34.610
<v 29>I can hear my fax machine go off and then I pull it off.</v>

178
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:39.790
<v 27>Officers observed the defendant engaged in deviant sexual conduct and oral sex.</v>

179
00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:41.750
And then that's when it hit me.

180
00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:46.820
Oh I mean it was so clear night and day to me I immediately knew what I had in

181
00:10:46.821 --> 00:10:47.654
my hand.

182
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:49.050
<v 4>Why why does he care so much about this man.</v>

183
00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:53.720
Well so when he wasn't being a bartender Lane was a community organizer

184
00:10:53.721 --> 00:10:55.520
particularly around LGBT issues.

185
00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:57.980
<v 30>I was president of the Gay and Lesbian Political Caucus.</v>

186
00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:00.950
<v 4>That's one of the oldest LGBT civil rights groups in the south.</v>

187
00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:04.940
He'd been waiting for this moment. How long had you been looking for a case.

188
00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:08.870
Seven eight years. Seven or eight years.

189
00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:12.670
Cause just to lay it out explicitly what why did you need it.

190
00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:13.760
<v 27>I needed a test case.</v>

191
00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:18.170
You can't change a law like that if you don't have a case.

192
00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:21.980
<v 4>People in the Texas legislature had been trying to remove this law from the</v>

193
00:11:21.981 --> 00:11:23.000
books for years.

194
00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:27.410
<v 31>According to Dale Carpenter but every time someone would introduce a proposal to</v>

195
00:11:27.411 --> 00:11:31.630
repeal the law it would get Snickers and catcalls in the state legislature.

196
00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:33.260
<v 1>It just wasn't really going anywhere.</v>

197
00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:37.580
So activists had decided the only way to get this done is to bypass the

198
00:11:37.581 --> 00:11:39.560
legislature and go straight to the courts.

199
00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:43.190
<v 27>So I needed a case I had to have someone guilty.</v>

200
00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:46.430
<v 4>So Lane starts trying to track them down at this point the two guys had been</v>

201
00:11:46.431 --> 00:11:49.970
released from jail and he eventually gets drawn on the phone conversation

202
00:11:49.971 --> 00:11:51.260
basically went like this.

203
00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:55.610
<v 27>Hi my name is Lane Lewis. I'm a gay activist here in town. You don't know me.</v>

204
00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:58.850
That's not important but I understand you've been arrested.

205
00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:03.350
I'm begging you not to plead out meaning don't just say you did it and pay the

206
00:12:03.351 --> 00:12:03.650
fine.

207
00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:06.170
<v 4>I knew I couldn't have em plead out because then there'd be nothing Lane could</v>

208
00:12:06.171 --> 00:12:06.440
do.

209
00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:09.710
<v 27>I said I will find you lawyers. I will raise the money.</v>

210
00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:11.060
I will pay for everything.

211
00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:15.400
Just don't do anything until you and I have an opportunity to meet.

212
00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:20.180
<v 4>A few weeks later they all meet at Mitchell Cortines office and it immediately</v>

213
00:12:20.181 --> 00:12:23.000
becomes clear that these guys are sort of an odd couple.

214
00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:28.480
<v 32>JOHN LAWRENCE At that time was about I think it was 55 years old tall white kind</v>

215
00:12:29.661 --> 00:12:30.350
of a big guy.

216
00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:33.650
<v 21>He worked as a lab technician for a hospital.</v>

217
00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:37.640
<v 4>Tyrone Gardner was a young skinny black guy 24 years younger than John.</v>

218
00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:38.840
No steady job.

219
00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:41.990
He bounced around between friends apartments just kind of went from place to

220
00:12:41.991 --> 00:12:43.340
place and job to job.

221
00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:47.780
<v 33>No idea what their connection was. They weren't lovers both heavy drinkers</v>

222
00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:50.623
very heavy.

223
00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:51.920
<v 4>Both had criminal records.</v>

224
00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:55.760
Yes Tyrone had been convicted of assault and drug possession.

225
00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:58.960
And John had been convicted in the 60s of murder by automobile.

226
00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:02.330
<v 30>They were not the perfect plane but they were not the poster boys these were not</v>

227
00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:07.130
pretty tweaks and they weren't political. No not at all not at all.

228
00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:10.820
<v 11>In fact when Lane told John Lawrence I'm a gay activist here in town.</v>

229
00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:12.740
<v 26>John Lawrence didn't even know what that was.</v>

230
00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:14.420
I don't know what a gay activist is.

231
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:20.240
<v 34>Basically neither of them had any interests like no interest in being a public</v>

232
00:13:20.241 --> 00:13:23.690
figure. So I gave him the whole Ask not.

233
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:28.730
<v 27>What your country can do for you ask not what you can do for your country</v>

234
00:13:28.731 --> 00:13:29.360
speech.

235
00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:33.140
<v 29>I mean literally I reminded them of who Harry Hay was.</v>

236
00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.840
<v 35>I just simply thought well now it's time for me to organize my people.</v>

237
00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:40.580
<v 33>Well Harry Hay was arguably the founder of the original LGBT movement.</v>

238
00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:45.470
You listeners may not remember but at one time it was illegal for certain number

239
00:13:45.471 --> 00:13:50.471
of gay males and the LGBT community to get together and one location was illegal

240
00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:51.540
can do it.

241
00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:55.500
<v 35>I dreamt even then of the idea that there would be networks of sanctuaries or</v>

242
00:13:55.501 --> 00:13:58.710
places where we could come and out of which we would be able to move and

243
00:13:58.711 --> 00:14:01.080
organize and change things across the country.

244
00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:03.990
So I told him a little bit about that history and.

245
00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.780
<v 36>How far we'd come and how far we had to go.</v>

246
00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:10.290
And that they had an opportunity to change their.

247
00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:17.350
So I told him I said. I'll be able to protect you.

248
00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:23.200
For maybe the first year or two but there's going to come a time where I will no

249
00:14:23.201 --> 00:14:27.940
longer be about you. It'll be about something much much bigger.

250
00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:32.020
So. They agreed

251
00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:37.360
Tyrone's attitude was OK. You know what do you need me to do.

252
00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:40.120
John was much more indignant.

253
00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:40.983
<v 16>I was pissed.</v>

254
00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:45.280
They picked the wrong person to pull this loan.

255
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:51.310
There was a ridiculous law but Texas loves to keep some antiquated things

256
00:14:52.271 --> 00:14:52.780
around.

257
00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:54.880
<v 27>He was mad. He was angry.</v>

258
00:14:55.150 --> 00:15:00.150
<v 11>And here's where the story gets complicated because at one point according to</v>

259
00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:04.780
Lane Lewis they were having this conversation and John was ranting you know

260
00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:09.190
about how he'd been treated and he said you know what the worst part is we won't

261
00:15:09.191 --> 00:15:11.820
even in fact you know we want to get up.

262
00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:15.130
<v 20>He said that they were not having sex. Wait what.</v>

263
00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:18.940
That they were not having sex that they were sitting in their underwear on the

264
00:15:18.941 --> 00:15:21.340
couch watching the late night news.

265
00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:23.620
<v 11>They say they were sitting there doing nothing.</v>

266
00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:27.880
And the cops just burst in and started pushing them around and that they were

267
00:15:27.881 --> 00:15:28.990
never even having sex.

268
00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:31.560
<v 0>But isn't this whole case about them having sex. Yeah.</v>

269
00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:35.660
So you're saying the thing that this case is supposed to be about may not be

270
00:15:35.661 --> 00:15:36.494
true right.

271
00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:41.820
<v 4>Well so I interviewed three of the four police officers Dale Carpenter says when</v>

272
00:15:41.841 --> 00:15:45.380
he talked to the police officers he did find that their stories were sort of all

273
00:15:45.381 --> 00:15:46.070
over the place.

274
00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:50.030
One guy said it was anal sex he saw one guy later said he thought it might have

275
00:15:50.031 --> 00:15:50.864
been oral.

276
00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:52.940
<v 26>The other two officers said they never saw anything.</v>

277
00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:57.080
So Dale says he believes John's story there probably was actually no sex.

278
00:15:57.170 --> 00:15:59.930
<v 4>He thinks what might have happened is that the cops walked in and saw some gay</v>

279
00:15:59.931 --> 00:16:02.720
art on the wall and some gay magazines lying around.

280
00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:06.830
<v 26>I have a feeling that really set off the officers and they said well we know</v>

281
00:16:06.831 --> 00:16:10.130
they're homosexuals they probably engaged in homosexual conduct at some point

282
00:16:10.131 --> 00:16:11.390
and that's illegal in Texas.

283
00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:14.840
<v 15>No no I. There was no no no doubt about it.</v>

284
00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:17.330
I mean I have no no reason to lie.

285
00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:21.980
<v 27>QUINN To this day still insists that he walked in on them and copulate.</v>

286
00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:24.500
<v 4>He says he saw what he saw and he just did his job.</v>

287
00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:27.590
<v 15>If you want to be homosexual and that's where you want leave your lifestyle</v>

288
00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:32.000
that's fine. I don't agree with your lifestyle but that's my opinion.

289
00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:33.440
That's what it is. It's an opinion.

290
00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:38.420
<v 11>So there's no way to know what actually happened obviously but in a way it</v>

291
00:16:38.421 --> 00:16:42.880
doesn't matter because when John said that to Lane that they weren't even having

292
00:16:42.881 --> 00:16:45.070
sex as a John Don't ever say that again.

293
00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:50.680
Don't ever say that to anybody. Again.

294
00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:55.030
<v 30>Because we couldn't have people know that we couldn't have people find that out.</v>

295
00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:56.580
We can go forward to this. Yep.

296
00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:01.680
<v 27>We were scared that the case would get screwed up at that point and potentially</v>

297
00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:04.810
the D.A. dropping the charges.

298
00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:09.070
<v 4>So basically you had to preserve if if Joe Quinn was lying on that police report</v>

299
00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:11.140
you had to preserve the lie correct.

300
00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:12.700
<v 0>Correct. Dumb question.</v>

301
00:17:12.850 --> 00:17:16.090
You can just do that you can just preserve a lie to keep a case going.

302
00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:17.410
You do that.

303
00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:22.410
<v 30>Well keep in mind and it wasn't our job to prove or disprove the lie.</v>

304
00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:27.130
<v 37>You know Elaine the thing that mattered was not what did or didn't happen that</v>

305
00:17:27.131 --> 00:17:30.430
night. The thing that mattered was what the arrest report said.

306
00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:35.260
<v 0>But if what the arrest report said potentially didn't happen should that matter.</v>

307
00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:37.600
<v 31>Well no. No one.</v>

308
00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:40.390
<v 25>Our legal system is not designed to bring out the truth.</v>

309
00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:42.880
This is a misconception. It does not bring out the truth.

310
00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:47.230
<v 26>That's Dale Carpenter again it is people who play their roles in pursuing</v>

311
00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:51.200
whatever they think their best interests are. And that's exactly what happened.

312
00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:59.070
<v 29>So for the first few years my job was to keep the boys out of the out of the</v>

313
00:17:59.071 --> 00:18:00.690
news. And why was that.

314
00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:06.210
Well they had a tendency to drink and get rowdy and fight and they like to go to

315
00:18:06.211 --> 00:18:11.040
seedy hotels and rent rooms and get really really high drunk whatever.

316
00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.680
And inevitably they would start fighting with each other.

317
00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:18.280
And so what I did what I would do is I would.

318
00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:21.000
I knew the different places they stayed.

319
00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:24.150
He says he would go to these seedy hotels and talk to the clerks give him a

320
00:18:24.151 --> 00:18:28.890
business card tell him if these boys come and check in they cause problems.

321
00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:33.260
Call me first ban on more than one occasion that happened I'd get a call at 2

322
00:18:33.261 --> 00:18:34.260
o'clock in the morning.

323
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:38.250
Your guys are here they're causing trouble I'm gonna have to call the cops.

324
00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:40.980
I would jump out of bed put on my clothes because we couldn't have them.

325
00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:43.920
You know they're already on the front page of The Houston Chronicle.

326
00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:48.610
We could not have our defendants doing a perp walk for drugs and alcohol.

327
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:53.040
So I would drive down there and I would figure out which one was causing the

328
00:18:53.041 --> 00:18:57.000
most problems. Put them in my car and I would drive them somewhere else.

329
00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:58.200
I would separate them out.

330
00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:02.400
<v 38>That happened more than once more than once.</v>

331
00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:06.780
<v 4>Celine said he had this fear that John and Tyrone Woods would start talking to</v>

332
00:19:06.781 --> 00:19:10.890
the media and let something slip about their version of the story.

333
00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:14.580
<v 27>So he gave them these little cards kept it in their wallet and small little</v>

334
00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:17.970
sentences basically said thank you for contacting me.

335
00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:22.260
Please refer to Lane Lewis and had my phone number and my email and I said so

336
00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:26.310
anytime the media contacts you don't think about what you say right.

337
00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:27.580
That's where you get screwed up.

338
00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:30.660
When you start thinking about what you want to say to the media pull this out of

339
00:19:30.661 --> 00:19:31.860
your wallet read it.

340
00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:33.053
<v 4>And hang up.</v>

341
00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:37.620
Even so there were these close calls as the case wound its way through the court

342
00:19:37.621 --> 00:19:38.454
system.

343
00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:42.990
<v 20>Mitchell KTM told me about this one time there was this press conference and we</v>

344
00:19:42.991 --> 00:19:47.570
came outside to the normal media group that was out there wanting quotes and

345
00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:50.610
talk to us and they didn't want to hear from the lawyers they wanted to hear

346
00:19:50.611 --> 00:19:51.480
from the clients.

347
00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:56.520
So it was like All right just this once Tyrone got up to the mike and I think a

348
00:19:56.521 --> 00:19:59.790
reporter asked him you know how do you feel about this.

349
00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:02.550
And he said we didn't do anything wrong.

350
00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:07.380
He just kind of yelled that out in a angry way we didn't do anything wrong.

351
00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:10.410
Mitchell pulled him back and was like Oh that's enough that's enough.

352
00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:12.930
Next day we didn't do anything wrong.

353
00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:16.260
That was the quote on the headlines of the morning's paper the next day.

354
00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:21.120
And certainly I knew what he meant. That they weren't having sex but you know.

355
00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:26.130
Could also be interpreted as homosexual conduct is nothing wrong.

356
00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:29.460
<v 39>He says luckily that's how people took it.</v>

357
00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:34.490
<v 40>It's very nerve wracking because this went on for years this was years.</v>

358
00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:37.490
Yeah couple of years. Here's kind of how it went down.

359
00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:40.040
<v 4>They started at this justice of the peace court.</v>

360
00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:42.770
They were sentenced to a fine of one hundred and twenty five bucks.

361
00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:46.130
They appealed and the case gets kicked up one level to the Harris County

362
00:20:46.131 --> 00:20:48.470
criminal court. They're fined again. They appeal it again.

363
00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:52.070
<v 25>Then it went to another level to the 14th Court of Appeals.</v>

364
00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:56.180
And one more level ultimately the Texas Criminal Court of Appeals which is the

365
00:20:56.181 --> 00:21:00.170
highest court in Texas for Criminal Appeals refused even to hear the case.

366
00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:03.460
<v 41>So the only next step is the Supreme Court</v>

367
00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:07.570
will hear argument next to no.

368
00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:08.890
<v 42>0 2 1 0 2.</v>

369
00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:13.920
<v 4>John get as Lawrence and Tyron Garner versus Texas March 26 2003 almost five</v>

370
00:21:14.801 --> 00:21:17.620
years after the arrest the case lands at the Supreme Court.

371
00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:19.840
And by the time it gets up there Mr. Smith.

372
00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:23.410
<v 43>Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.</v>

373
00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:25.900
<v 3>The story is not dwelled upon at all.</v>

374
00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:29.740
They didn't say these guys weren't in a relationship.

375
00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:32.710
They didn't say if these guys were having sex.

376
00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:34.810
One of them was cheating on his partner.

377
00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:37.210
Seems like they might have not been having sex anyway.

378
00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:42.670
<v 44>They didn't say any of those things they said there are gay families that family</v>

379
00:21:42.671 --> 00:21:46.510
relationships are established that there are hundreds of thousands of people

380
00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:49.180
that this is about families and relationships.

381
00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:53.050
<v 4>How people in loving relationships have the right to express themselves in</v>

382
00:21:53.051 --> 00:21:54.920
whatever they want it's none of the state's business.

383
00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:58.660
<v 44>The opportunity to engage in sexual expression as they will in the privacy of</v>

384
00:21:58.661 --> 00:22:02.440
their home homes performs much the same function that it does in the marital

385
00:22:02.441 --> 00:22:03.274
context.

386
00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:06.730
<v 4>You know basically people in relationships have the right to have sex with each</v>

387
00:22:06.731 --> 00:22:08.230
other regardless of their gender.

388
00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:12.010
<v 44>You should protect it for everyone that this isn't a fundamental matter of</v>

389
00:22:12.011 --> 00:22:12.880
American values.

390
00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:17.920
<v 0>So now it's like watching something float up from the sort of mucky like realm</v>

391
00:22:18.221 --> 00:22:22.090
of human real life real life and then it just gets kind of prettier as it floats

392
00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:22.840
upwards.

393
00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:27.520
<v 4>Yeah it was such a pretty story that people were suspicious of it like people</v>

394
00:22:27.521 --> 00:22:30.520
were asking how did this arrest even happen.

395
00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:34.420
<v 20>This was a setup. You all set this up. That was their big battle cry.</v>

396
00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:37.000
<v 4>So Mitchell Curtin says he heard this over and over again.</v>

397
00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:40.480
<v 20>It wasn't a setup but I always wanted to say so so what if it was.</v>

398
00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:43.210
Does that make it any less of a case.

399
00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:46.840
<v 43>Who cares unless the court has further questions. Thank you very much.</v>

400
00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:49.030
Thank you Mr. Smith. The case is submitted to.

401
00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:53.290
The honorable court is now adjourned until Monday next 10:00.

402
00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:59.420
<v 45>Three months later the opinion of the court. No.</v>

403
00:22:59.450 --> 00:23:03.590
0 2 1 0 2 Lawrence against Texas will be announced by Justice Kennedy.

404
00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:06.830
<v 31>Justice Kennedy begins reading a summary of his opinion.</v>

405
00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:11.780
<v 46>The question before the court is the validity of a Texas statute making it a</v>

406
00:23:11.781 --> 00:23:16.730
crime for two persons of the same sex to engage in certain intimate sexual

407
00:23:16.731 --> 00:23:19.550
conduct. And everybody's waiting for the outcome.

408
00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:21.680
In Houston Texas police officers.

409
00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:25.700
So for context it wasn't totally clear how this case was gonna come out because

410
00:23:25.701 --> 00:23:30.701
17 years earlier there'd been a case called Bowers against Hardwick Bowers vs.

411
00:23:31.341 --> 00:23:36.341
Hardwick and then they had ruled that sodomy laws were fine and I would suggest

412
00:23:36.471 --> 00:23:39.560
to the court that there is no constitutional right to conclude.

413
00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:44.330
<v 42>That there should be a fundamental right to engage in homosexual sodomy.</v>

414
00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:48.290
<v 4>And the Supreme Court almost never overrules things that are that recent Bowers</v>

415
00:23:48.291 --> 00:23:50.900
vs. Hardwick had some factual similarities to this case.

416
00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:54.290
So Justice Kennedy starts talking about all the similarities between the cases

417
00:23:54.291 --> 00:23:56.840
these officers were dispatched to a private residence.

418
00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:01.430
The tension starts building officers observed Lawrence and another man Tyron

419
00:24:01.431 --> 00:24:06.320
Garner engaging in a sexual way and then finally he got to the moment where he

420
00:24:06.321 --> 00:24:09.440
said Morris was not correct when it was decided.

421
00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:12.110
<v 47>And is not correct today.</v>

422
00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:21.370
<v 48>And at the point Justice Kennedy said that there were people sobbing in the</v>

423
00:24:21.371 --> 00:24:26.290
Supreme Court Barrios vs. Hardwick should be and now is overruled.

424
00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:33.670
<v 49>At rallies across the nation gay rights advocates celebrated their legal</v>

425
00:24:33.671 --> 00:24:36.880
victory. A ruling so broad it surprised even many of them.

426
00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:40.870
The court ruled in favor of two Texas men who challenged the state law that made

427
00:24:40.871 --> 00:24:42.700
homosexual sex a crime.

428
00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:47.470
<v 50>The ruling overturns a Texas law that allowed police to arrest gays for having</v>

429
00:24:47.471 --> 00:24:48.280
sex.

430
00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:52.750
<v 51>Twelve other states have similar laws including that morning John Lawrence was</v>

431
00:24:52.751 --> 00:24:55.350
at home in his apartment in Houston watching them.

432
00:24:55.450 --> 00:25:00.300
I am laying in bed trying to go back get my 40 works and all of a sudden as this

433
00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:02.380
has ruled the law unconstitutional.

434
00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:16.820
<v 52>I came out of bed quite happy</v>

435
00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:23.360
obviously not everybody was happy about it.

436
00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:27.290
<v 53>Let me be clear that I have nothing against homosexuals or any other group</v>

437
00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:31.940
promoting their agenda through law school through normal democratic means

438
00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:33.560
Justice Scalia said.

439
00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:37.340
<v 4>Basically if you want this to happen that's fine but you're going about it the</v>

440
00:25:37.341 --> 00:25:40.670
wrong way. The court is not the place where this decision should be made.

441
00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:45.790
You need to go talk to your fellow citizens and convince them that this law

442
00:25:45.831 --> 00:25:46.760
needs to change.

443
00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:51.720
Coming to us and asking us to bypass what your fellow citizens seem to want.

444
00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:56.360
<v 53>That is not how democracy should work persuading one's fellow citizens is one</v>

445
00:25:56.361 --> 00:26:01.361
thing and imposing one's views in absence of Democratic majority will is

446
00:26:01.731 --> 00:26:02.564
something else.

447
00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:07.990
<v 1>He sees this as a small minority imposing their views on everybody else and then</v>

448
00:26:10.941 --> 00:26:12.950
he said he was worried about something else.

449
00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:18.010
<v 53>Today's opinion dismantles the structure of constitutional law that has</v>

450
00:26:19.161 --> 00:26:24.161
permitted a distinction to be made between heterosexual and homosexual.

451
00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:29.420
<v 4>That this decision would open the floodgates and that it would only be a matter</v>

452
00:26:29.421 --> 00:26:34.320
of time before the court was being asked to decide on gay marriage like the

453
00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:36.080
relevant principal. And he was right.

454
00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:39.950
<v 54>When Kennedy read the marriage decision in 2015 in Lawrence vs.</v>

455
00:26:39.951 --> 00:26:41.840
Texas he talked about Lawrence.

456
00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:45.770
The court held that private intimacy of same sex couples cannot be declared a

457
00:26:45.771 --> 00:26:50.760
crime. Yet it does not follow that freedom stops there. Outlaw.

458
00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:53.480
To outcast may be a step forward.

459
00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:55.790
But it does not achieve the full promise of liberty.

460
00:26:57.270 --> 00:27:00.180
<v 11>So what happened to Garner in Lawrence.</v>

461
00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:04.710
Well John Lawrence and Tyron Garner didn't live to see this.

462
00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:08.790
Tyrone died in 2006 from meningitis.

463
00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:10.710
<v 31>No job had no money.</v>

464
00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:16.070
He was 39 and his family was very poor and they didn't have the money to bury

465
00:27:16.201 --> 00:27:20.160
him. They didn't even have the money to reclaim his body from the county morgue.

466
00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:25.170
<v 4>As for John Lawrence he died in 2011 at 68 from heart problems.</v>

467
00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:28.410
<v 31>We didn't even find out about it until a month after he was dead.</v>

468
00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:33.810
This hero of the gay rights movement was unknown and UN warned that his passing

469
00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:38.750
what does that say about sort of the.

470
00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:42.470
Practice of bringing things to the Supreme Court.

471
00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:49.480
<v 55>That the two people whose story this case revolves around could sort of fade</v>

472
00:27:49.521 --> 00:27:50.930
into the background afterwards.

473
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:58.000
<v 32>Well one is tempted I think to be very cynical in some ways because it means</v>

474
00:27:58.101 --> 00:28:02.390
that these people were useful as long as they were useful.

475
00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:04.370
<v 55>And after that they could be forgotten.</v>

476
00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:06.950
I have to say I actually had their reaction a little bit.

477
00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:11.180
I mean this is a story of social progress but there's something a little funny

478
00:28:11.181 --> 00:28:12.380
at the center of it for me.

479
00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:17.810
<v 56>And as we were playing this for our legal editor Elena Stahl And I think that we</v>

480
00:28:17.811 --> 00:28:19.880
talked about spin in a lot of ways.

481
00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:25.220
Our legal system devolves into an end justifies the means kind of justice.

482
00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:31.600
<v 57>We say we care we care about the process so much and look at the processes it is</v>

483
00:28:33.081 --> 00:28:33.914
extremely important.

484
00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:38.030
<v 0>Ellie isn't this just weird to you like this is a dumb law like a dumb dumb dumb</v>

485
00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:39.170
dumb law.

486
00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:42.950
Why not just shouldn't there be an avenue to say this is a dumb law was taken

487
00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:47.960
away why did you have to find some people who didn't have sex they say pretend

488
00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:52.820
that they have sex then march them up all the way through the court system and

489
00:28:52.821 --> 00:28:53.540
then forget about them.

490
00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:56.450
I mean it just seems weird to me it seems like a empty theater.

491
00:28:57.230 --> 00:28:58.340
Why do we have to do it that way.

492
00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:03.580
<v 57>Because if you want to put a ballot initiative up in 2003 in Texas saying is gay</v>

493
00:29:03.981 --> 00:29:08.981
sex OK it would fail it would fail in 2003 in Texas it would probably fail in

494
00:29:10.341 --> 00:29:14.330
2016 in Texas. It will probably fail in 2032.

495
00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:19.540
In Texas that's why that's why the majority isn't always right.

496
00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:21.780
So you you.

497
00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:26.370
Take you basically take the Democratic vote and this is this is a again this

498
00:29:26.371 --> 00:29:29.160
goes back right to the founding of our country like When are you gonna let

499
00:29:29.161 --> 00:29:34.161
popular will run wild and when are you going to constrain it not just restrain

500
00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:38.190
and constrain it. When are you going to stop it.

501
00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:40.860
And Lawrence v.

502
00:29:40.861 --> 00:29:44.640
Texas is as an example of a we're just going to stop it.

503
00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:46.943
And it was the right call.

504
00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:58.110
<v 58>So after this Supreme Court decision did Texas immediately go and repeal the</v>

505
00:29:58.111 --> 00:29:58.944
law.

506
00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:01.950
<v 59>No actually the law is still on the books in Texas.</v>

507
00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:07.410
No the Texas legislature like other legislatures around the country refuses to

508
00:30:07.411 --> 00:30:08.244
repeal the law.

509
00:30:08.910 --> 00:30:13.910
It stays there a a remnant of a kind of a dark almost forgotten past.

510
00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:23.730
<v 18>Keep in mind they can't enforce the law now that it's unconstitutional but they</v>

511
00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:24.853
refused to take it off.

512
00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:36.060
<v 19>Coming up a very deep dive into the guy behind one of the most controversial</v>

513
00:30:36.061 --> 00:30:40.710
cases this term. A case that just got decided late last week.

514
00:30:42.210 --> 00:30:43.043
<v 60>This is more perfect</v>

515
00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:50.670
Chief Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States.

516
00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:57.340
<v 61>Oh yay yay yay persons having business before the honorable the supreme court of</v>

517
00:30:58.671 --> 00:31:01.960
the United States are admonished to draw near their own

518
00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:08.780
God save the United States in this horrible cartoon.

519
00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:16.490
<v 62>Hi my name's Peter Fink and I'm calling for it so no refugee camp in the area.</v>

520
00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:19.910

modern world. More information about sloan.

W w w dot Sloan dot org.

524
00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:35.490
<v 63>Hi I'm Bassem Youssef. I have a new show Remade in America presented by café.</v>

525
00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:38.840
I'm exploring what it's like to be an outsider in this country.

526
00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:42.920
I'm talking to people from all walks of life people like me who came here from

527
00:31:42.921 --> 00:31:47.240
other countries and people who were born here but never felt like they totally

528
00:31:47.241 --> 00:31:49.180
fit in like our recent guest.

529
00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:54.320
Cameron Esposito when I realized I was gay I was at a college where you could be

530
00:31:54.321 --> 00:31:55.790
kicked out of school for being gay.

531
00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:59.660
Join us as we talk about America from a totally different perspective.

532
00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:07.073
<v 0>This is more perfect.</v>

533
00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:12.060
I'm Jad Abumrad if Supreme Court cases can sometimes feel like plays where the

534
00:32:12.061 --> 00:32:14.850
activist and lawyers are sort of like the directors pulling the strings and the

535
00:32:14.851 --> 00:32:18.810
people in the center of the case the plaintiffs are just like these imperfect

536
00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:22.890
actors who have been cast in the script sort of been written for them.

537
00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:26.100
Well that dynamic was definitely in effect this term.

538
00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:28.960
<v 50>In fact just last week.</v>

539
00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:33.990
We have had a decision just handed down in what was billed as the landmark

540
00:32:34.841 --> 00:32:37.870
affirmative action case of this term.

541
00:32:37.930 --> 00:32:41.680
<v 64>Josh this is a decision that will impact college admissions nationwide.</v>

542
00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:45.370
<v 65>The case Fisher versus University of Texas centered around the following</v>

543
00:32:45.371 --> 00:32:49.330
question should universities be able to use racial preferences in college

544
00:32:49.331 --> 00:32:50.164
admissions.

545
00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:53.530
<v 66>Now the University of Texas has this policy where the top 10 percent of every</v>

546
00:32:53.531 --> 00:32:55.260
high school class automatically get in.

547
00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:59.170
But for everybody else they will consider factors like race.

548
00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:01.190
The question was Is that OK.

549
00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:07.710
A couple days ago the court decided barely yes it is OK.

550
00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:11.620
<v 50>The Supreme Court has upheld the affirmative action program at the University of</v>

551
00:33:11.621 --> 00:33:15.880
Texas affirmative action and higher education is constitutional.

552
00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:20.630
<v 67>Now the case was brought by a young white woman named Abigail Fisher.</v>

553
00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:24.010
<v 40>Abigail Fisher Abigail Fisher believed her race may have hurt her chances to</v>

554
00:33:24.011 --> 00:33:25.600
attend the University of Texas.

555
00:33:25.690 --> 00:33:28.750
<v 68>There were people in my class with lower grades who weren't in all the</v>

556
00:33:28.751 --> 00:33:31.560
activities I was in who were being accepted into the team.

557
00:33:31.810 --> 00:33:34.780
And the only other difference between us is the color of our skin.

558
00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:38.890
<v 67>She was arguing that affirmative action discriminates against her as a white</v>

559
00:33:38.891 --> 00:33:39.280
person.

560
00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:44.280
Now what you saw in the wake of that decision and even before especially online

561
00:33:44.411 --> 00:33:46.540
was just a torrent of hate.

562
00:33:47.170 --> 00:33:48.850
<v 69>Directed squarely at her.</v>

563
00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:52.940
So I'm trying to hold my tongue but I'm about to tell Abby to have a seat.

564
00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:55.720
<v 70>OK I can't get into a good college.</v>

565
00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:59.840
Black people have a better pitch if you don't take your class somewhere.

566
00:33:59.890 --> 00:34:04.420
<v 71>Maybe if her grades didn't suck you dumb ass maybe you would have gotten into a</v>

567
00:34:04.421 --> 00:34:06.470
good college with the bad grades.

568
00:34:06.790 --> 00:34:09.310
<v 72>Really happy you and your racist lawyer guy sat down.</v>

569
00:34:09.490 --> 00:34:12.850
<v 0>It's all been pointed right at Abby Fisher which you could argue honestly isn't</v>

570
00:34:12.851 --> 00:34:16.630
fair because this case may have very little to do with Abby Fisher.

571
00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:19.720
<v 73>I mean if you look at the press conference I don't believe that student should</v>

572
00:34:19.721 --> 00:34:22.240
be treated differently based on their race.

573
00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:26.480
<v 0>Abby Fisher is the one at the podium but behind her far in the background and</v>

574
00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:31.800
you'll see the sky he's there in every single press conference sort of back in

575
00:34:32.110 --> 00:34:33.400
the air at the edge of the frame.

576
00:34:33.490 --> 00:34:37.510
Not too many people know about him His name is Edward Bloom and he's the one who

577
00:34:37.511 --> 00:34:42.070
actually brought the case when it comes to this case and so many others.

578
00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:44.130
He is the architect.

579
00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:51.080
He's brought dozens of lawsuits not just this one.

580
00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:55.130
And he seems to be a maestro of getting cases to the Supreme Court that

581
00:34:55.131 --> 00:34:56.630
challenged civil rights law

582
00:34:58.490 --> 00:35:01.810
critics sort of paint him as this like one man wrecking crew for civil rights

583
00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:05.550
like he's almost single handedly rolling back decades of civil rights law.

584
00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:09.230
And when it comes to affirmative action he says he's not done just to make a

585
00:35:09.231 --> 00:35:13.250
long story short we wanted to meet him figure out how he does.

586
00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:17.780
<v 4>Yeah. So I went to Tallahassee. Reporter Katherine Wells takes from here.</v>

587
00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:21.680
That's where he lives or he winters in Tallahassee.

588
00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:23.420
Golden retriever.

589
00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:25.550
<v 74>You walk in.</v>

590
00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:30.550
What initially struck you his golden retriever is what initially struck me

591
00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:34.790
literally physically. Nice meeting here.

592
00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:36.193
<v 75>Of course.</v>

593
00:35:36.350 --> 00:35:40.100
And I don't know what I was expecting but when you hear about these cases you

594
00:35:40.101 --> 00:35:45.080
know they're I mean critics are really people are mad about these cases is

595
00:35:45.081 --> 00:35:46.220
deeply disturbed.

596
00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:49.850
<v 73>Truly outrageous so betrayal of the American people.</v>

597
00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:55.030
<v 76>So I go to meet him and your flight from Austin to Dallas to Tallahassee</v>

598
00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:59.640
uneventful and on time and good. Do you think. Good.

599
00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:01.790
He's like a totally nice guy.

600
00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:05.000
<v 11>He's a regular guy. Was he look like like a dad.</v>

601
00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:08.960
<v 76>There is something in me that just loves tradition and custom.</v>

602
00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:11.310
He loves listening to the Great American Songbook.

603
00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:16.310
<v 77>Life is a beautiful thing. Frank Sinatra as long as I.</v>

604
00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:21.110
And. Ella Fitzgerald.

605
00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:24.650
I love art and museums.

606
00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:28.350
<v 78>Independent films golf. What's his what's his story.</v>

607
00:36:28.370 --> 00:36:31.700
<v 1>What's his backstory. Well he's 64.</v>

608
00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:35.600
<v 76>I was born in a small town in Michigan.</v>

609
00:36:35.930 --> 00:36:40.520
My dad owned a shoe store there. My mom worked with him in the shoe store.

610
00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:43.940
<v 4>What had been your kind of political leanings up to this point.</v>

611
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.000
<v 78>Well I'm the first Republican my mother ever met him to use the word typical but</v>

612
00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:54.980
it really was a typical liberal Jewish household.

613
00:36:55.190 --> 00:37:00.190
My mother and father were Franklin Roosevelt Harry Truman Democrats.

614
00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:03.470
<v 73>Always voted Democrat.</v>

615
00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:08.270
Then he said he was that way too all the way through college the University of

616
00:37:08.271 --> 00:37:13.271
Texas grad school State University of New York where I spent a year studying of

617
00:37:13.401 --> 00:37:14.234
all things.

618
00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:21.470
<v 4>African literature but he says somewhere along the way his political leanings</v>

619
00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:25.580
sort of started to shift. I spent a summer in Israel

620
00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:32.060
living on a kibbutz and he says he came out of that experience a little less

621
00:37:32.061 --> 00:37:33.790
liberal than he was before.

622
00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:40.580
And you got married and then in the early 80s he is living in Houston working as

623
00:37:40.581 --> 00:37:45.410
a stockbroker. And we met.

624
00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:46.930
<v 64>Aren't our neighbors.</v>

625
00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:53.260
This particular couple they were New Yorkers who had moved to Houston both grew

626
00:37:53.391 --> 00:37:58.391
up as liberals and the guy he sort of opened my eyes to the world of the neo

627
00:38:02.781 --> 00:38:03.614
cons.

628
00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:07.520
<v 76>The guy introduced him to these magazines Weekly Standard National Review</v>

629
00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:10.110
Commentary magazines like conservative magazines.

630
00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:13.280
<v 4>And this was around the time that the neocon movement was really hitting its</v>

631
00:38:13.281 --> 00:38:18.050
stride. You had all these New York liberals defecting is what he says.

632
00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:23.080
Thousands of individuals who grew up in the 1960s that started to question.

633
00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:27.020
<v 76>The wisdom of these liberal policies.</v>

634
00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:32.470
And he says slowly slowly over time very gradually he became one of those

635
00:38:33.141 --> 00:38:33.974
people.

636
00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:36.980
<v 4>In any case Fast forward a little bit.</v>

637
00:38:37.010 --> 00:38:42.010
<v 1>He's living in Houston kind of a garden variety existence and something happens</v>

638
00:38:42.801 --> 00:38:45.500
that sends him on this entirely new path.

639
00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:48.080
Basically he and his wife moved to a new neighborhood.

640
00:38:48.350 --> 00:38:51.800
They moved from the suburbs into the downtown area more urban.

641
00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:56.920
<v 76>And in 1990 when we went to vote for the first time in our new neighborhood I</v>

642
00:39:00.381 --> 00:39:05.381
realized that the Republican Party had not fielded a candidate to oppose the

643
00:39:06.531 --> 00:39:09.530
Democrat incumbent running for Congress.

644
00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:14.650
This is a district that has almost 600000 people and you don't have a choice.

645
00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:21.980
You've only got one person running. Blum decided to run himself.

646
00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:25.160
I lost I don't. That was no great surprise to anyone.

647
00:39:25.610 --> 00:39:27.080
He actually lost by 32 points.

648
00:39:27.110 --> 00:39:32.110
But along the way it's something really unusual happened during that campaign.

649
00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:37.370
<v 4>He and his wife lark you know they decided they were going to go meet voters in</v>

650
00:39:37.371 --> 00:39:38.204
their district.

651
00:39:38.210 --> 00:39:42.530
They got a giant printout of all of the addresses in the 18th congressional

652
00:39:42.531 --> 00:39:43.190
district.

653
00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:46.940
<v 64>What was then called a walking list and they just started going door to door</v>

654
00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:51.500
meeting people handing out literature and they'd walk down say Oak Street.

655
00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:56.590
I would take the even side of Oak Street and my wife would take the odd numbered

656
00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:03.620
side of Oak Street and we would start to walk.

657
00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:08.860
And he says very quickly they realized that the district's shape.

658
00:40:10.130 --> 00:40:10.963
<v 4>Was funny.</v>

659
00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:14.200
Some houses on one side of the street would be in the district and then the

660
00:40:14.201 --> 00:40:15.500
houses on the other side wouldn't.

661
00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:19.870
And sometimes the district would snake down a highway catch an apartment complex

662
00:40:20.130 --> 00:40:20.510
come back.

663
00:40:20.510 --> 00:40:25.460
<v 79>It just didn't make sense. This is like Bloom wife of Edward Bloom.</v>

664
00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:30.580
It was peculiar because we had maps that we had to follow and it was very odd

665
00:40:31.791 --> 00:40:35.390
the way some streets were in the districts and some weren't.

666
00:40:35.570 --> 00:40:39.410
Took a while for it all to really sink in as to how this could happen.

667
00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:44.500
<v 80>After I guess about a week of this we realized that neighbors had been separated</v>

668
00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:52.340
almost house by house because of their race.

669
00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:59.560
<v 1>He comes to believe that the reason this was done was for the explicit purpose</v>

670
00:40:59.561 --> 00:41:01.840
to create a majority African-American district.

671
00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:06.790
<v 81>This isn't untrue. This</v>

672
00:41:08.490 --> 00:41:13.280
is from a clear and simple wrong part of the reason this was done was the Voting

673
00:41:13.281 --> 00:41:14.600
Rights Act of 1965.

674
00:41:14.810 --> 00:41:19.810
<v 82>Millions of Americans are denied the right to vote because of their color.</v>

675
00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:26.450
<v 58>This act was a giant step forward in civil rights.</v>

676
00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:30.080
You know one of the primary things that did is eliminate barriers to voting like

677
00:41:30.081 --> 00:41:34.460
poll taxes and literacy tests all these strategies that had been used to keep

678
00:41:34.461 --> 00:41:35.360
minorities from voting.

679
00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:40.160
<v 51>And then this other thing it did sort of in a roundabout way through a series of</v>

680
00:41:40.161 --> 00:41:45.161
interpretations is it encouraged the creation of districts where the majority of

681
00:41:45.261 --> 00:41:46.970
voters were minorities.

682
00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:51.050
And that's because you know one of the strategies that had been used previously

683
00:41:51.051 --> 00:41:56.051
to sort of dilute the minority vote was to take minority communities.

684
00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:58.540
And they called it cracking.

685
00:41:58.740 --> 00:42:02.450
They sort of split them apart into many different districts so that they were

686
00:42:02.451 --> 00:42:06.650
never in the majority enough to elect a representative. Right.

687
00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:11.710
So the Voting Rights Act tried to correct that the 18th Congressional District

688
00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:14.720
was one of these majority minority districts.

689
00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:19.760
<v 76>The district was drawn by the Texas legislature to have a slight</v>

690
00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:24.260
African-American majority. I think about 51 percent African-American.

691
00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:25.460
<v 4>But this was the problem.</v>

692
00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:29.810
According to Bloomberg the way they got to that African-American majority was by

693
00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:32.870
creating this district that zigzagged all over the city and cut through

694
00:42:32.871 --> 00:42:33.530
neighborhoods.

695
00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:36.860
<v 80>I could not understand people lived close together.</v>

696
00:42:36.890 --> 00:42:39.290
They send their kids to the neighborhood schools.

697
00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:42.110
They shopped in the neighborhood shopping centers.

698
00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:44.630
They were worried about neighborhood issues.

699
00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:49.990
To break these neighborhoods apart by race seemed so wrong to me.

700
00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:56.560
<v 75>In his mind this law was actually not limiting discrimination but actually</v>

701
00:42:57.621 --> 00:42:59.430
perpetuating. Well yeah.

702
00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:05.080
<v 3>And I don't know what the average person upon realizing this would have done.</v>

703
00:43:05.690 --> 00:43:08.720
<v 76>But I decided to file a lawsuit.</v>

704
00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:16.010
<v 83>He decided to sue the state of Texas called a few friends who lived in the 18th</v>

705
00:43:16.011 --> 00:43:18.410
district and a few other districts in Texas.

706
00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:22.760
An African-American Hispanic Indonesia kept looking and looking and looking

707
00:43:22.761 --> 00:43:27.020
until I found a lawyer that I could afford seven thousand dollars a month.

708
00:43:27.050 --> 00:43:32.050
We filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of Texas is redistricting

709
00:43:32.451 --> 00:43:33.170
plan.

710
00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:37.220
The basic charge was yes the Voting Rights Act was good in its day but now it

711
00:43:37.221 --> 00:43:41.360
was being used as this excuse to segregate people into racially polarized

712
00:43:41.361 --> 00:43:42.194
districts.

713
00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:47.410
<v 76>It worked its way through the lower courts and to my shock and surprise in 1995</v>

714
00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:55.910
We'll hear argument now on number 94 identify George W. Bush vs.

715
00:43:55.911 --> 00:43:56.720
Al Jazeera.

716
00:43:56.720 --> 00:44:00.490
<v 64>The Supreme Court took it up and you went to oral argument. Yeah we all did.</v>

717
00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:02.420
<v 84>Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.</v>

718
00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:04.130
<v 76>So there we all are.</v>

719
00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:09.800
<v 84>Our opponents stepped to the lectern and that issue this direct appeal is the</v>

720
00:44:09.801 --> 00:44:12.650
constitutionality of three congressional districts.

721
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:16.880
They make their arguments at the court below erroneously ruled a racially

722
00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:21.740
gerrymandered Texas basically said y'all we have to put people together by race.

723
00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:26.800
<v 85>The Texas Legislature has the obligation to satisfy federal requirements and the</v>

724
00:44:27.201 --> 00:44:30.920
Voting Rights Act is a federal requirement like remember the Voting Rights Act.

725
00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:34.220
<v 4>We're trying to make sure that there are enough minorities in this district so</v>

726
00:44:34.221 --> 00:44:38.780
that they have a chance to elect a representative then or advocate Mr. Tribe

727
00:44:38.781 --> 00:44:43.310
we'll hear from you made his arguments you get to the point that that was just

728
00:44:43.530 --> 00:44:47.420
being made. Bloom's lawyer basically said but look at the map.

729
00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:49.880
The map is bizarre.

730
00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:54.200
And the only reason it could have gotten this way is because you're only

731
00:44:54.201 --> 00:44:57.290
thinking about race. Only race. Think about it.

732
00:44:57.320 --> 00:44:59.110
That seems messed up isn't that messed up.

733
00:44:59.270 --> 00:45:01.100
<v 86>It doesn't matter what your ultimate goal is.</v>

734
00:45:01.370 --> 00:45:06.050
You cannot use certain forbidden to race is forbidden by the 14th Amendment to

735
00:45:06.051 --> 00:45:09.090
be used as a tool. In his example the people St.

736
00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:12.170
Mary's and you know it's a very tense situation.

737
00:45:12.330 --> 00:45:16.220
<v 87>If I'm not asking about in some way do you know any other situation in the law</v>

738
00:45:16.490 --> 00:45:20.090
in which we allow race to be used as a surrogate for him to be unconstitutional

739
00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:22.630
but to use it as a more not racism. How is this done.

740
00:45:22.670 --> 00:45:25.850
<v 86>I thought that's how you should know about me as you can see by I don't really</v>

741
00:45:25.851 --> 00:45:29.530
think so. That would require me. You did say that didn't.

742
00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:33.930
Let me just say that I didn't let me find say that I say that I'm not.

743
00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:37.670
So in the end when the Supreme Court.

744
00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:40.320
<v 37>Gives out this very</v>

745
00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:46.880
hair splitting decision that I think gets at this deeper question that in our

746
00:45:47.331 --> 00:45:51.530
society and in our discourse we just haven't figured out how to talk about

747
00:45:51.890 --> 00:45:52.520
anyway.

748
00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:56.480
And it basically said this you know look if you're defining race just as the

749
00:45:56.481 --> 00:45:57.590
color of someone's skin.

750
00:45:58.130 --> 00:46:02.450
The government cannot use that in any way and that's against the constitution.

751
00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:07.580
On the other hand if you take this wider view and you look at race in the

752
00:46:07.581 --> 00:46:12.080
context of history social context then how can the government address

753
00:46:12.081 --> 00:46:14.250
discrimination without taking race into account.

754
00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:17.450
They have to so it's this difficult balance.

755
00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:21.340
<v 1>You can't look at race but you have to look at race and gender.</v>

756
00:46:21.650 --> 00:46:25.820
The Supreme Court says to Texas look all you're doing in this case is sorting

757
00:46:25.821 --> 00:46:27.920
people based on how they're labeled on a census.

758
00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:30.960
You're not looking at that wider context you're not looking at.

759
00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:34.070
If these communities live next to each other if they share common interests

760
00:46:34.190 --> 00:46:38.150
you're just sorting them based on race alone. And that's not good enough.

761
00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:41.410
<v 76>You can't do that when the opinion came down.</v>

762
00:46:41.930 --> 00:46:44.990
The Supreme Court ruled in our favor 5 to 4.

763
00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:48.680
That was quite a day.

764
00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:52.280
The day that we won that lawsuit I was.

765
00:46:54.350 --> 00:46:58.380
<v 88>Got the world on a string. Looked for ever.</v>

766
00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:02.910
After that. Edward Blum decided that this would be a thing.

767
00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:04.780
It became a passion.

768
00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:09.310
He would use the courts to try to strike down every race based policy he could.

769
00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:12.310
<v 78>The legal team was taken on the road.</v>

770
00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:17.400
I recruited plaintiffs in New York Virginia South Carolina to challenge

771
00:47:17.980 --> 00:47:22.870
congressional district plans and we won in each of those states.

772
00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:27.400
He helped sue school districts in Florida and Texas to end the use of racial

773
00:47:27.401 --> 00:47:30.340
quotas in K through 12 magnet schools.

774
00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:33.050
<v 4>He went after affirmative action in Houston city contracting.</v>

775
00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:36.580
<v 64>Today Houston could become the first city to kill affirmative action.</v>

776
00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:38.990
That one was actually a ballot initiative and it failed.

777
00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:44.040
But I've been the architect of over two dozen lawsuits six of which six made it

778
00:47:45.671 --> 00:47:47.680
to the Supreme Court including.

779
00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:53.660
<v 4>In 2013 in a 5 to 4 vote 5 to 4 very divided court.</v>

780
00:47:53.690 --> 00:47:58.690
<v 40>The Supreme Court today struck down a key part of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.</v>

781
00:47:59.130 --> 00:48:02.420
Supreme Court today struck down a very important part of the Voting Rights Act.

782
00:48:02.460 --> 00:48:07.460
<v 71>That key 1965 landmark law is considered one of the most important pieces of</v>

783
00:48:08.031 --> 00:48:10.250
civil rights legislation ever passed.

784
00:48:10.310 --> 00:48:15.080
<v 1>Shelby County vs. Holder. This decision gutted the Voting Rights Act.</v>

785
00:48:15.530 --> 00:48:18.680
Specifically there was this part of it that said states and counties with a

786
00:48:18.681 --> 00:48:23.000
history of discrimination have to check with the federal government first before

787
00:48:23.001 --> 00:48:24.410
they go about changing their voting laws.

788
00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:27.410
Basically the federal government was saying look you've been up to all this

789
00:48:27.411 --> 00:48:29.150
stuff where now we're watching you.

790
00:48:29.570 --> 00:48:33.110
The Supreme Court said you know times have changed.

791
00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:37.430
That list was made a long time ago and it's outdated.

792
00:48:37.490 --> 00:48:42.490
<v 64>This decision restores an important constitutional order to our system of</v>

793
00:48:43.401 --> 00:48:44.234
government.

794
00:48:44.390 --> 00:48:46.320
<v 4>This was Blum's biggest victory.</v>

795
00:48:46.550 --> 00:48:49.040
<v 89>When Shelby County came down I burst into tears.</v>

796
00:48:49.790 --> 00:48:52.710
I think a lot of people burst into tears when that came down. You know it.

797
00:48:53.090 --> 00:48:55.030
Yeah I know I understand it.

798
00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:56.750
<v 73>It is deeply disturbing.</v>

799
00:48:56.840 --> 00:49:01.580
I am deeply disappointed deeply disappointed with the court's decision in this

800
00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:05.780
matter. This decision is a betrayal of the American people. This is a game.

801
00:49:07.170 --> 00:49:08.540
<v 90>Changer during the civil rights movement.</v>

802
00:49:08.690 --> 00:49:10.880
People died for the precious right to vote.

803
00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:14.000
<v 4>This is Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee of Houston Texas.</v>

804
00:49:14.090 --> 00:49:17.510
<v 90>I would like to have the Supreme Court justices go back in time.</v>

805
00:49:20.010 --> 00:49:22.660
Go back in time and march with those who marched.

806
00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:27.480
<v 91>After Bloody Sunday from Selma to Montgomery.</v>

807
00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:29.850
<v 90>Ed Blum has a right to his opinion.</v>

808
00:49:30.330 --> 00:49:33.150
It doesn't mean that it has to be the opinion of the United States.

809
00:49:33.810 --> 00:49:38.490
<v 89>I understand that people were you know gravely upset.</v>

810
00:49:38.770 --> 00:49:43.260
I also know that there were people who were gravely relieved and gravely

811
00:49:44.370 --> 00:49:45.270
gratified.

812
00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:49.710
<v 0>Yeah but I think what gets a lot of people is that you look at these civil</v>

813
00:49:49.711 --> 00:49:54.711
rights videos you see tens of thousands 40000 people in the streets marching and

814
00:49:55.230 --> 00:49:57.940
you hold that and if you make a split screen in your mind you hold that.

815
00:49:57.960 --> 00:50:02.190
Thousands tens of thousands people on one side on the other side you.

816
00:50:02.310 --> 00:50:06.120
One guy. It does make you ask basic questions about democracy.

817
00:50:06.210 --> 00:50:07.590
That's a false paradigm.

818
00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:12.160
<v 89>It's that maybe your split screen.</v>

819
00:50:12.210 --> 00:50:15.780
But that's really not the reality of all of this.

820
00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:20.990
Look in 1964 1965 America was held hostage by the legacies of slavery and the

821
00:50:27.740 --> 00:50:30.480
chokehold of Jim Crow.

822
00:50:31.350 --> 00:50:36.350
Fast forward to 2006 the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act the chokehold

823
00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:43.500
had gone away.

824
00:50:44.190 --> 00:50:49.190
African-Americans in the Deep South registered to vote in numbers that often

825
00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:55.700
exceeded whites participated in elections in numbers that exceeded whites in

826
00:50:58.291 --> 00:51:01.650
terms of electoral opportunities.

827
00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:06.860
We have come 180 degrees from 1968.

828
00:51:08.810 --> 00:51:13.320
<v 0>We turned those degrees because of the law which you've helped overturn and we</v>

829
00:51:13.321 --> 00:51:16.890
don't know to what degree that is the psychology of America changing or the fact

830
00:51:16.891 --> 00:51:21.480
that we had a law that kept people in line and now that law is gone and now we

831
00:51:21.481 --> 00:51:22.320
see voter I.D.

832
00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:27.180
laws coming back into play which I think any sane person would admit is it is it

833
00:51:27.181 --> 00:51:30.090
is it is an attempt a blatant attempt to disenfranchise people.

834
00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:33.360
So it feels a little bit strange to I mean I completely agree with you.

835
00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:34.350
Things have gotten better.

836
00:51:34.620 --> 00:51:37.920
The same time I think well that was because of the law that's now gone.

837
00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:44.120
<v 89>Look laws change laws evolve and and at some point they need to come to an end.</v>

838
00:51:57.010 --> 00:51:57.843
OK.

839
00:51:58.030 --> 00:52:03.030
<v 92>So just to jump back in play something we haven't actually talked about yet is</v>

840
00:52:03.550 --> 00:52:06.970
our original question how how does this actually happen. How does it work.

841
00:52:07.330 --> 00:52:08.950
<v 83>How is one person</v>

842
00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:12.910
able to be so effective to do this work.

843
00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:16.180
You need a computer a printer a cell phone.

844
00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:19.330
<v 93>That's really about it.</v>

845
00:52:20.290 --> 00:52:22.990
<v 76>Where. Who pays for the lawyer fees and who do you go to.</v>

846
00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:28.020
Well there are individuals that know of my work and there are foundations okay.

847
00:52:28.300 --> 00:52:30.140
<v 4>So he's a five a one see three.</v>

848
00:52:30.250 --> 00:52:34.480
Like the NAACP and Lambda Legal that funded the Lawrence versus Texas case.

849
00:52:34.750 --> 00:52:39.100
And if you're a five a one see three public charity as he is you don't have to

850
00:52:39.101 --> 00:52:40.690
reveal your donors to the public.

851
00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:45.550
We do know a couple of his donors though and they're wealthy very conservative

852
00:52:45.551 --> 00:52:46.384
foundations.

853
00:52:46.450 --> 00:52:51.450
<v 1>So in the end what he does is just sort of a more maybe a more strategic or</v>

854
00:52:52.451 --> 00:52:55.690
sophisticated version of what Lane Lewis did in the first story.

855
00:52:56.350 --> 00:53:00.370
Like in this case that he just lost last week he knew he wanted to challenge

856
00:53:00.371 --> 00:53:04.930
affirmative action. So the first thing he did was sort of do a casting call.

857
00:53:05.020 --> 00:53:07.390
<v 20>He set out to find the perfect white student.</v>

858
00:53:07.570 --> 00:53:10.200
He set up a web called you teen not fair dawg.

859
00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:11.740
<v 94>He made a recruiting video.</v>

860
00:53:11.770 --> 00:53:16.720
It's time for you to stop using race as a factor in the admissions policy pretty

861
00:53:16.721 --> 00:53:17.260
budget.

862
00:53:17.260 --> 00:53:20.950
<v 4>It's just him looking at the camera in front of a poster that says you teen out</v>

863
00:53:21.210 --> 00:53:21.400
fair.

864
00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:26.400
<v 94>I encourage all high school students who have been rejected from duty to visit</v>

865
00:53:26.850 --> 00:53:29.290
at your teen not fair dot org.

866
00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:33.250
<v 4>Tell us your story and then he started talking to the people who responded.</v>

867
00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:38.280
<v 89>I think I ended up with about one hundred seventy five responses of those about</v>

868
00:53:40.091 --> 00:53:45.091
a hundred were viable with a seventy five you threw out just like oh funky just

869
00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:50.440
outrageous. Well I just didn't think they would be sympathetic.

870
00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:54.310
<v 1>So we whittled the hundred down to seven that he thought would be sympathetic of</v>

871
00:53:54.311 --> 00:53:55.360
those seven.

872
00:53:55.550 --> 00:54:00.310
<v 89>There were one or two that you know did not really want to go forward like I</v>

873
00:54:00.311 --> 00:54:01.330
don't want the attention.

874
00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:06.250
<v 34>They were fearful of you know the backlash anyway to make a long story short.</v>

875
00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:10.480
He ended up finding Abby Fisher because a friend of his called and said Hey my

876
00:54:10.481 --> 00:54:13.840
daughter just got rejected from UTI. I heard you were looking.

877
00:54:14.770 --> 00:54:19.770
<v 95>I think I'm a very like very like introverted person so I feel like sometimes</v>

878
00:54:22.330 --> 00:54:27.010
there's a lot of pressure but I think in the end it's totally worth it.

879
00:54:27.150 --> 00:54:32.150
And to be able to have a voice in this and to know that my voice is making a

880
00:54:32.861 --> 00:54:34.210
difference is really rewarding.

881
00:54:34.330 --> 00:54:38.500
<v 4>She seemed like the perfect plaintiff strawberry blonde hair She's petite she's</v>

882
00:54:38.501 --> 00:54:40.690
kind of shy in front of the camera in a good way.

883
00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:43.960
<v 96>But last week they lost.</v>

884
00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:46.720
<v 4>So we talked to him before all this happened.</v>

885
00:54:46.750 --> 00:54:50.530
So we weren't able to get a reaction from him but he did tell an Austin

886
00:54:50.531 --> 00:54:54.490
newspaper that the night after the decision came down.

887
00:54:55.300 --> 00:54:56.830
He had three glasses of wine.

888
00:54:57.250 --> 00:55:01.690
He took an Ambien and he thought about these particular lyrics in a Billy Joel

889
00:55:01.691 --> 00:55:04.450
song. A lot of folks. Told me how.

890
00:55:07.350 --> 00:55:10.660
<v 89>The songs called keeping the faith. I'm a long distance runner.</v>

891
00:55:11.620 --> 00:55:16.620
If there's something just emblematic about my personality I run long distances.

892
00:55:18.100 --> 00:55:20.110
<v 4>He says he's definitely not done.</v>

893
00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:24.010
He's actually already has two more cases against affirmative action in the

894
00:55:24.011 --> 00:55:24.670
works.

895
00:55:24.670 --> 00:55:29.670
<v 89>I have retained counsel to litigate Harvard's admissions policies and University</v>

896
00:55:30.371 --> 00:55:32.320
of North Carolina's admissions policies.

897
00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:34.390
<v 0>I am sorry it just doesn't strike anyone.</v>

898
00:55:34.420 --> 00:55:37.630
I mean forget the politics whether you're on on Bloom's side or not this just

899
00:55:37.631 --> 00:55:40.360
the tactic doesn't strike anyone as like fishy.

900
00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:43.060
<v 57>I resist giving Ed Bloom that much credit.</v>

901
00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:47.800
That's Ellie Mr. elegant legal editor I would say that fundamentally he's just

902
00:55:47.890 --> 00:55:52.890
implementing a strategy that was perfected by the people he now ironically seeks

903
00:55:53.381 --> 00:55:56.860
to disenfranchise. This is a civil rights movement one to one.

904
00:55:57.190 --> 00:56:02.190
He's got laws that he doesn't like that he knows he can't overturn through an

905
00:56:02.261 --> 00:56:05.260
election. Remember this Blum's a failed congressional candidate.

906
00:56:05.890 --> 00:56:07.930
He had that lust for for political power.

907
00:56:08.170 --> 00:56:11.920
He couldn't get it through the electoral system but he found this other way to

908
00:56:11.921 --> 00:56:15.400
do it. This is exactly what the civil rights movement did OK.

909
00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:19.980
<v 1>So to me this is one of the most fascinating things about this story.</v>

910
00:56:21.330 --> 00:56:24.360
If we go back to you remember this case there's a famous case called Plessy

911
00:56:24.690 --> 00:56:27.240
versus Ferguson. Sort of no not really Plessy v.

912
00:56:27.241 --> 00:56:29.430
Ferguson I think is a good example.

913
00:56:31.140 --> 00:56:35.430
<v 97>This is Susan Carl law professor at American University Washington College of</v>

914
00:56:35.431 --> 00:56:38.670
Law. OK. Plessy versus Ferguson 1892.

915
00:56:38.730 --> 00:56:43.730
So that was a case where the state of Louisiana had adopted a new separate cars

916
00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:48.870
law which said that people of color and white people could not ride in the same

917
00:56:48.871 --> 00:56:52.740
train cars. And if you've heard the story this is how it goes.

918
00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:56.220
Somebody named Homer Plessy a black man sits down in a white car.

919
00:56:56.340 --> 00:56:59.070
He is rested and he decides to sue.

920
00:56:59.100 --> 00:57:01.440
And his case goes all the way to the Supreme Court. Now.

921
00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:05.940
<v 96>The thing about that case is that it was a total setup.</v>

922
00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:08.520
You mean so if we go back.

923
00:57:09.630 --> 00:57:13.560
<v 98>When Louisiana passed that law requiring separate cars early civil rights groups</v>

924
00:57:13.561 --> 00:57:15.780
were obviously horrified by this. But.

925
00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:19.890
<v 99>The railroad companies were actually mad about this too because they thought it</v>

926
00:57:19.891 --> 00:57:23.490
would be much more expensive to run the trains if they had to have add

927
00:57:23.491 --> 00:57:26.910
additional trains so they'd have white cards and cars of color.

928
00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:32.360
And so civil rights activists and the railroad companies they recruited somebody

929
00:57:32.641 --> 00:57:37.641
named Homer Plessy who was seven eighths white one eighth African-American.

930
00:57:38.610 --> 00:57:41.970
<v 4>And they sent him to go sit in a white car on a train.</v>

931
00:57:42.060 --> 00:57:46.470
He got into a first class white people's car.

932
00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:51.920
<v 100>And they sent somebody to go arrest him like they got a off duty police officer</v>

933
00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:54.780
or something. Well they actually hired a detective.

934
00:57:54.870 --> 00:57:58.410
You could do that at the time that you could hire a private detective to make an

935
00:57:58.411 --> 00:58:02.070
arrest. And so they they hired that person too. So.

936
00:58:02.830 --> 00:58:07.830
<v 101>Plessy gets under the train the conductor comes by and Plessy is like just</v>

937
00:58:08.521 --> 00:58:10.740
thought I should let you know I'm actually in a black.

938
00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:14.220
And the conductor says Well in that case you're going to need to be on the other

939
00:58:14.460 --> 00:58:18.170
car in this train. Homer Plessy says I'm good actually.

940
00:58:18.390 --> 00:58:22.170
I'm gonna be staying right here. And the conductor says No really.

941
00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:23.100
You have to move.

942
00:58:23.150 --> 00:58:28.150
And Homer Plessy says no really not gonna and things get heated and eventually

943
00:58:28.501 --> 00:58:30.980
this detective that they've hired comes in and arrest them.

944
00:58:33.390 --> 00:58:35.370
<v 102>And they brought a lawsuit.</v>

945
00:58:35.820 --> 00:58:39.720
That's amazing the whole thing is cooked starting with the arrest to challenge

946
00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:43.170
the separate cars law and they were able to get it up to the U.S. Supreme Court

947
00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:48.620
and they were hoping that they would be able to establish that the idea of

948
00:58:48.691 --> 00:58:51.030
separating the races was unconstitutional.

949
00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:56.360
<v 103>But unfortunately they miss calculated and the court ruled that the law was</v>

950
00:58:56.550 --> 00:58:57.400
constitutional.

951
00:58:57.420 --> 00:59:01.680
And what they got instead was separate but equal totally backfired.

952
00:59:02.550 --> 00:59:03.383
But.

953
00:59:04.050 --> 00:59:07.200
<v 104>It was this early example of this other way.</v>

954
00:59:07.410 --> 00:59:12.180
You know if you can find a plaintiff or create a plaintiff you might be able to

955
00:59:12.181 --> 00:59:15.450
bypass the legislature and go to the Supreme Court instead.

956
00:59:15.780 --> 00:59:20.780
<v 105>The NAACP later picked up on this but they were the true geniuses they perfected</v>

957
00:59:21.931 --> 00:59:26.640
it and they perfected it under circumstances where victories were highly

958
00:59:26.641 --> 00:59:27.474
unlikely.

959
00:59:27.570 --> 00:59:29.520
<v 104>For example in the early nineteen hundreds.</v>

960
00:59:29.550 --> 00:59:33.660
They do things like send a black guy and a white guy all over New York City to

961
00:59:33.661 --> 00:59:34.830
segregated theaters.

962
00:59:36.490 --> 00:59:40.070
<v 105>And see if one of them was prevented from being seated.</v>

963
00:59:40.650 --> 00:59:45.650
<v 104>And if they were they would sue those theaters and when victory is that way then</v>

964
00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:51.480
there was this other law in Louisville Kentucky that said nobody could buy a

965
00:59:51.481 --> 00:59:56.370
house or live on a block in which white people lived if they were

966
00:59:56.610 --> 00:59:57.630
African-American.

967
00:59:57.990 --> 01:00:01.290
So they recruited a white guy to sell a house to a black guy and then they had

968
01:00:01.291 --> 01:00:04.710
the black guy refused to take the house so the white guy could say you said you

969
01:00:04.711 --> 01:00:07.170
would buy the house but now you're reneging on it.

970
01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:10.930
<v 102>They African-Americans said I'm not buying the house because I can't live there.</v>

971
01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:14.220
White guy sues the black guy. Again it was a manufactured case.

972
01:00:14.610 --> 01:00:19.560
<v 103>That was one of the MWC piece first victories and that's the case where Justice</v>

973
01:00:19.561 --> 01:00:23.490
Holmes said in a dissent that he ended up not publishing. Hey wait a minute.

974
01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:25.140
This isn't even a real case.

975
01:00:28.170 --> 01:00:29.003
<v 102>At the time.</v>

976
01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:33.480
Anything that involved manufacturing a case or fomenting litigation.

977
01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:38.130
All of those things were legal. So not just unethical but actually illegal.

978
01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:40.140
Yes criminally illegal.

979
01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:44.430
<v 51>It was seen as something like how we see ambulance chasing today.</v>

980
01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:49.520
The lawyers for the end WTOP were very aware of these statutes and this came to

981
01:00:50.101 --> 01:00:55.101
a head in the 1950s the MWC P wanted to get the court to end segregated schools.

982
01:00:56.790 --> 01:00:59.280
Basically they wanted to overturn Plessy vs.

983
01:00:59.281 --> 01:01:01.500
Ferguson and the way they were doing this.

984
01:01:01.530 --> 01:01:03.270
They you know they needed the plaintiffs.

985
01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:07.470
So the way they were looking for plaintiffs is going to meetings with parents

986
01:01:07.471 --> 01:01:12.471
and sort of quietly you know suddenly trying to ask parents if they wanted to be

987
01:01:13.741 --> 01:01:14.940
the face of these cases.

988
01:01:15.270 --> 01:01:18.840
<v 1>Now Virginia knew that they were doing this and they tightened up these</v>

989
01:01:18.841 --> 01:01:23.640
regulations that said you know you can't drum up litigation to try to stop them

990
01:01:23.641 --> 01:01:24.510
from doing this.

991
01:01:24.750 --> 01:01:29.580
So the NAACP sued and they took this issue all the way to the Supreme Court.

992
01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:35.140
<v 106>That litigation is essential because no matter how illegal it is public</v>

993
01:01:35.221 --> 01:01:40.221
officials are free and interfering in that case the Supreme Court said actually

994
01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:47.760
manufacturing litigation is is a form of political expression really.

995
01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.330
<v 1>And it is totally ok like free speech basically.</v>

996
01:01:50.550 --> 01:01:55.550
Yeah like it's a way of expressing your political viewpoint and test case

997
01:01:56.311 --> 01:01:59.640
litigation exploded after this and in the 60s and 70s.

998
01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:04.760
<v 103>A lot of other movements the women's movement poor people's movement saw the</v>

999
01:02:05.911 --> 01:02:09.120
success the civil rights movement was having with these strategies that they

1000
01:02:09.121 --> 01:02:10.110
adopted them as well.

1001
01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:15.060
<v 76>And now I guess that includes Ed Blum Yeah the founding principles of the civil</v>

1002
01:02:15.061 --> 01:02:20.061
rights movement have been embraced by the vast majority of Americans in this

1003
01:02:20.461 --> 01:02:25.461
country and those founding principles those founding principles guide these

1004
01:02:27.331 --> 01:02:32.331
lawsuits that basic fundamental guiding principle of the civil rights movement

1005
01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:36.650
and how it needs to be applied today.

1006
01:02:36.930 --> 01:02:41.040
<v 57>I am that's I can't say what I think of that on family on Family Radio</v>

1007
01:02:42.710 --> 01:02:44.630
that that is that is not. That is not accurate.

1008
01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:49.530
Absolutely is not carrying the standard forward for civil rights in America.

1009
01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:50.470
That is not what he's doing.

1010
01:02:50.730 --> 01:02:54.480
<v 0>But Ali says he is actually doing something that's deeply important to our</v>

1011
01:02:54.481 --> 01:02:55.314
political system.

1012
01:02:55.380 --> 01:02:59.460
<v 57>When you look at the current election cycle I see a lot of people who who agree</v>

1013
01:02:59.461 --> 01:03:04.200
with Ed Blum they agreed with him in a way that shouldn't be expressed in the

1014
01:03:04.201 --> 01:03:08.610
polls. They're out there. This is one way for that.

1015
01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:12.210
I mean I mean and that happens I think again that's another callback to the

1016
01:03:12.211 --> 01:03:15.480
civil rights movement when you have a minority population who believes in

1017
01:03:15.481 --> 01:03:20.430
something they just get trampled in popular elections. OK.

1018
01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:23.730
But do they still have a voice. Should they still have a voice.

1019
01:03:23.790 --> 01:03:28.290
Should they still have a way to enact change on their behalf over the will of

1020
01:03:28.291 --> 01:03:29.124
the majority.

1021
01:03:29.730 --> 01:03:33.630
Again that seems to me textbook what courts are supposed to be able to do to

1022
01:03:33.631 --> 01:03:37.500
look out for the rights of the minorities political minorities more than kind of

1023
01:03:37.501 --> 01:03:41.820
ethnic or racial religious and see that they are not being trampled by majority

1024
01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:43.013
driven attorney.

1025
01:03:44.170 --> 01:03:48.170
Ed Blum is helping a minority of people who believe what he believes.

1026
