00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379
 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:20.459
so in the next 10 weeks we have to take

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:20.469
so in the next 10 weeks we have to take
 

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:22.050
so in the next 10 weeks we have to take
this proposal and I'll go through a

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060
this proposal and I'll go through a
 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.000
this proposal and I'll go through a
little bit of what it means but it's

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010
little bit of what it means but it's
 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.129
little bit of what it means but it's
going to be more than you can basically

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:26.139
going to be more than you can basically
 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:27.869
going to be more than you can basically
report because there's a lot of

report because there's a lot of
 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:30.270
report because there's a lot of
different parts to it but it basically

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280
different parts to it but it basically
 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.399

we're able to provide them the
 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:42.229
we're able to provide them the

talks to pedestrians and what yep thanks

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180
 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.150
so if you look at what we want to get to

for mobility for all of our residents

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519
for mobility for all of our residents
 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.240
for mobility for all of our residents
now I'll think about really mobility in

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250
now I'll think about really mobility in
 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.790
now I'll think about really mobility in
the previous century Andrew Carnegie in

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800
the previous century Andrew Carnegie in
 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.040
the previous century Andrew Carnegie in
his time it was really about how do we

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050
his time it was really about how do we
 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.590
his time it was really about how do we
get big steel to market and so we build

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600
get big steel to market and so we build
 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.510
get big steel to market and so we build
out rails when we build out rivers and

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520
out rails when we build out rivers and
 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.430
out rails when we build out rivers and
we build out transportation networks and

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440
we build out transportation networks and
 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.100
we build out transportation networks and
then around the 1950s and Mayor David

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110
then around the 1950s and Mayor David
 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.380
then around the 1950s and Mayor David
Lawrence we started thinking about how

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:40.390
Lawrence we started thinking about how
 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.930
Lawrence we started thinking about how
do we get people downtown so that we

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940
do we get people downtown so that we
 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.690
do we get people downtown so that we
could become a corporate work center and

could become a corporate work center and
we did win 1970s or the third largest

part of a new economy as well so I think

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:51.740
part of a new economy as well so I think
 

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:53.800
part of a new economy as well so I think
that when other cities are doing their

that when other cities are doing their
proposals and what I've heard from the

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:55.160
proposals and what I've heard from the
 

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:57.940
proposals and what I've heard from the
other mayor's was very similar I think

00:17:57.940 --> 00:17:57.950
other mayor's was very similar I think
 

00:17:57.950 --> 00:18:00.280
