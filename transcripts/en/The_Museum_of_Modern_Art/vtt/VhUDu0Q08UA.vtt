00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.279
We're looking at a drawing that was not made
for a real project.

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.290
No one commissioned this skyscraper.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.160
No one asked for it.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:16.039
Wright imagined it and presented it as a kind
of polemical gift to the world.

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:23.439
This drawing, over 8 feet tall, we know from
photos in the archive, was prepared for a

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:31.750
press conference that Wright called, in Chicago
in 1956, to present to the world the absolute

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.270
outlandish project for a mile-high skyscraper.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:42.650
So this drawing, it's a manifesto about architecture
because it has a lot of information, inscriptions,

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.010
depictions on it that are very intriguing
and curious.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.220
A little hard to understand at first glance.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.040
Well, very easy to understand but hard to
figure out why.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:59.980
It's also, in a way, an autobiography because
it has Wright's educational degrees, statements

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.230
about who he is, and a list of people that
he admires.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:11.530
So I wanted to figure that out, unpack all
the inscriptions, understand what it is.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:17.299
Almost a half of the sheet is not taken up
by the design itself, but is taken up by this

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:25.630
long scroll of information and then this embedding,
if you will, of the skyscraper, not just in

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:31.719
the lands of the prairies of Chicago, but
also in the history of architecture.

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:38.939
What we actually see, if we tried to unpack
this panorama, is the great pyramid of Cheops,

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:45.729
Egyptian civilization, a modern obelisk, the
19th-century Washington Monument in Washington,

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:51.940
DC, by the architect Robert Mills, the tallest
freestanding masonry all stone building at

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:58.549
the time &nbsp;of its completion, the first really
great tall iron, new material of the 19th-century,

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:04.619
ironwork, the Eiffel Tower of 1889, and then
the Empire State building of the late '20s,

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.630
early '30s, the tallest building when it was
unveiled.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.600
You could say that there are two time scales
here.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.820
There's a time scale that's very long history
of civilization, gathered together almost

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:22.310
like an imaginary world's fair in Chicago,
and a history of architecture as it relates

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:29.490
to engineering through a series of great figures,
a kind of pantheon of great men because they

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:30.890
were all men.

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.050
Architects, one only, Louis Sullivan and engineers.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.320
Some of the people are still famous.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.720
Others, I had to really dig around to try
to find out who they were.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.050
First, I thought this list that starts off
with Louis Sullivan then goes to Elisha Otis,

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.610
the inventor of the elevator.

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:51.910
Others, Coignet and Monier, less well known
unless you're an expert in the history of

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.770
development of reinforced concrete.

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.360
Very vital for the principle that Wright is
going to work with here.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:04.040
Memorials, which also includes John Roebling,
the engineer of the Brooklyn Bridge.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.310
&nbsp;
Then salutations to a group of people Torroja,

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.640
Beggs-Cross, Pier Luigi Nervi, Polivka, Malliart.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.940
For the most part, very, very well-known engineers.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.950
Polivka perhaps the least well-known.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.420
The Polivka archive is at the State University
of New York at Buffalo, off in JetBlue to

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:31.170
Buffalo, and in that wonderful set of boxes
that Polivka's widow left to Buffalo, find

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:37.520
snapshots of Polivka visiting with Frank Lloyd
Wright, the telegram that Polivka sent to

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.380
Frank Lloyd Wright saying he admired his ideas
on organic structure, the proposal to work

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.760
with him on various projects, the sheets of
calculations that I can't make any sense out

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.680
of, of how he figures out the mathematics
of the ramp of the Guggenheim.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.500
A very deep connection is emerging as I go
box through box.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.070
I've come to the working conclusion trying
to understand this complicated drawing with

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:07.160
all of itâ€™s packed in messages that this
ultimately is Wright's last autobiography.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:13.470
He wrote one that he amended over the years
from its first publication in the '30s, enlarged

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.639
long reading project, but this is the most
concise autobiography that he's left.

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:24.389
It's how he wants to be seen in the future
as a landmark of the history of architecture.
