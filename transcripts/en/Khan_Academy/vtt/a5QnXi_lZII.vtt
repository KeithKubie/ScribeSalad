00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.900
Let's do a slightly
more complicated

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.710
two-dimensional projectile
motion problem now.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:11.830
So in this situation, I am going
to launch the projectile off

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:12.470
of a platform.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.660
And then it is going to
land on another platform.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:27.190
And I'm going to fire the
projectile at an angle.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:28.970
Let me draw this a
little bit better.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.460
So I'm going to
fire the projectile

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.020
at an angle of-- let me
use a not so clean number.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.920
Let's say it is a
53-degree angle.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.720
And it's coming
out of the cannon.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.960
And let me make it clear.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.100
So it's coming out--
let me do it this way,

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.880
just to make it 100% clear.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.660
So this angle right
over here is 53 degrees.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.650
And we are going
to have it come out

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:07.110
of the muzzle of the cannon
with a velocity of 90

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:07.860
meters per second.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.430
And just to give ourselves
a sense of the heights,

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.630
or how high it's being
launched from-- so

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.420
from the muzzle of the
cannon down to here.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.550
So this height right
over here, let's say

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.780
that that is 25 meters.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.725
And let's say that this height
right over here is 9 meters.

00:01:34.986 --> 00:01:36.610
And so we're essentially
launching this

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.140
from a height of 25 meters.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.660
I know in the last video,
even though I drew the cannon

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.050
like this, we
assumed that it was

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.260
being launched from
an altitude of 0

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.930
and then landing back
at an altitude of 0.

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.380
Here we're assuming
we're launching it

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.300
from an altitude of 25
meters, because that's

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.281
when it's leaving the muzzle.

00:01:54.281 --> 00:01:55.780
And it's going to
start decelerating

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.196
at least in the
vertical direction

00:01:57.196 --> 00:01:59.520
as soon as it leaves the muzzle.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.470
And then we're
assuming it's not going

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.020
to land back at
the same altitude.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.490
It's going to land at
a different altitude.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.839
So how do we think
about this problem?

00:02:07.839 --> 00:02:09.630
So the first thing
you'll always want to do

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.370
is divide your velocity
vector into its horizontal

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.770
and vertical components.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.800
You use the vertical
component to figure out

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.467
how long it's going
to stay in the air.

00:02:18.467 --> 00:02:20.800
And then you use the horizontal
component to figure out,

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.529
given how long it's in the
air, how far did it travel.

00:02:23.529 --> 00:02:25.070
And once again,
we're going to assume

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.120
that air resistance
is negligible.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.280
So just based on what we
did in the last video--

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.740
and I'll go through all of the
steps in this one, as well.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:43.010
So if we draw our vector, the
length here is going to be 90.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.430
This is our velocity vector.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.320
The angle over here between
the x-axis and our vector

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.430
is 53 degrees.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.970
And let me draw the
horizontal component.

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.330
The horizontal component
would look like this.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.650
And the vertical component--
I'll do it in orange.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.850
The vertical component would
look like-- that's not orange.

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:06.350
The vertical component
will look like this.

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.930
And so the vertical
component of the vector--

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.180
what would be the length of
this side right over here?

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.570
Well, this is the opposite side.

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.630
We know from basic
trigonometry sine

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.780
of an angle is opposite
over the hypotenuse.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:27.490
So we know that the
sine of 53 degrees

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.860
is equal to this
opposite side, is

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.810
equal to the vertical velocity.

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.150
And I could write
it's the magnitude

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.556
of the vertical velocity.

00:03:44.556 --> 00:03:46.180
I write that subscript
y, because we're

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.360
in the y direction.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.230
That's the vertical
direction, over the length

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.020
of the hypotenuse,
over the magnitude

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.810
of our original vector.

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.930
Or we can get that this
side right over here.

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.370
If we multiply both
sides by 90, we

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.670
get that the
magnitude of that side

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:10.250
is going to be equal to 90
times the sine of 53 degrees.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.190
Now, if we want to do
the horizontal component,

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.700
the horizontal side
is adjacent to this.

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.590
Cosine, soh cah toa.

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.615
Cosine is adjacent
over hypotenuse.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:33.180
So the horizontal
component of our velocity,

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:39.580
I'll say in the x direction,
over the hypotenuse, over 90,

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:46.060
is equal to the
cosine of 53 degrees.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.150
Cosine is adjacent
over hypotenuse.

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.370
Adjacent, that's
this length, over 90.

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.460
Multiply both sides by 90.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.440
You get that the
horizontal component

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.705
is equal to 90 times
cosine of 53 degrees.

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.550
Now, how do we
figure out how long

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:11.720
this thing stays in the air?

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.770
Well, we'll use the
vertical component for that.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.250
And especially since we're
dealing with different levels,

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:22.460
we can't use that more basic
reasoning, that hey, whatever

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.080
velocity we start
off at, it's going

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.170
to be the same velocity but
in the opposite direction.

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:27.390
Or the same magnitude
and velocity

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:28.570
but the opposite direction.

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.860
Because we're not going
to the same elevation.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.630
But what we could do is
we can use the formula

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.070
that we derived in
the previous video.

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.360
That the displacement--
let me just copy and paste

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.120
this a little bit
lower so we can use it.

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.500
So I'll stick it
right over here.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.240
So we could use this.

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.286
We know that the displacement is
equal to the initial velocity--

00:05:52.286 --> 00:05:54.160
and we're dealing with
the vertical direction

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.680
right here-- times the change
in time plus the acceleration,

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.480
times the change in time
squared, divided by 2.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.354
So how do we use this to figure
out how long were in the air?

00:06:02.354 --> 00:06:03.520
So what is the displacement?

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.370
If we're starting
at 25 meters high,

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.840
and we're going
to 9 meters high.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.740
So over the course, while
this thing is traveling,

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.660
it will be displaced
downwards 16 meters.

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.360
Or another way to
think about it is

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.160
our displacement in
the vertical direction

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.130
is going to be equal
to negative 16 meters.

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:32.840
Let me write that a
little bit bigger.

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.760
Negative 16 meters, right?

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.200
Because 25 minus 9 is 16.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:42.060
And so we can put
that into the formula

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:44.110
that we derived in
the previous video.

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.920
We get negative 16-- I won't
write the units here just so

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:52.680
that we don't take up
too much real estate,

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.270
so that at least
it looks simple--

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:56.404
is equal to the
initial velocity.

00:06:56.404 --> 00:06:58.570
We're dealing with just the
vertical dimension here.

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:00.236
So we're just dealing
with the vertical.

00:07:02.244 --> 00:07:04.410
And remember, it's negative
because our displacement

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:05.560
is going to be downwards.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.170
We're losing altitude.

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:10.610
So our vertical velocity--
we already figured that out.

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:13.670
It is 90 times the
sine of 53 degrees.

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.109
Actually, let me do
it in that same color.

00:07:21.109 --> 00:07:22.900
The first time we do
a new type of problem,

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:26.450
it's good to know-- so 90
times the sine of 53 degrees,

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:33.230
times our change in time,
is equal to the acceleration

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:36.980
of-- due to the force of gravity
for an object in free fall

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:40.390
is going to be negative 9.8
meters per second squared.

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:42.710
But we're dividing that by 2.

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:50.020
So we're going to have minus 4.9
meters per second squared times

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:50.956
delta t squared.

00:07:50.956 --> 00:07:52.330
Times our change
in time squared.

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:58.660
So how do we solve
something like this?

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:00.530
You can't just factor
out a t and solve it.

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:03.200
But you might recognize
this is a quadratic equation

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:03.880
right over here.

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.588
And the way you solve
quadratic equations

00:08:05.588 --> 00:08:09.230
is you get everything onto
one side of this equation.

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:11.320
And then you either
factor it out.

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:12.870
But more likely
in this situation,

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:14.810
we will use the
quadratic formula,

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:16.630
which we've proved
in other videos

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:20.250
and hopefully given you the
intuition for it-- to actually

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:22.869
solve for the times where
your elevation, where

00:08:22.869 --> 00:08:24.660
your displacement in
the vertical direction

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:26.430
is negative 16 meters.

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:28.250
And you'll get two
solutions here.

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:30.940
And one of the solutions will
be a negative change in time.

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:33.580
So it'll be like at
sometime in the past,

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:35.500
you were also at
negative 16 meters.

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.280
That's nonsensical
for this problem.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:40.440
So we'll want to take
the positive value here.

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:46.250
So let's put all of this on
one side of the equation.

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:47.845
So let's add 16 to both sides.

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:54.230
On the left-hand side,
you just get a 0.

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:55.871
0 is equal to--
and I'll write it

00:08:55.871 --> 00:08:58.370
in kind of the traditional way
that we're used to seeing it.

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:00.078
I'll write the highest
degree term first.

00:09:00.078 --> 00:09:03.435
So negative 4.9 times
delta t squared.

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:25.320
And then we have plus 90 sine
of 53 degrees times delta t,

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.335
and then plus 16.

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:32.170
I'm going to do that in yellow.

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:35.406
All of this is equal to 0.

00:09:35.406 --> 00:09:37.530
And this, once again, is
just a quadratic equation.

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:39.560
We can find its roots.

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.400
And the roots will be
in terms of delta t.

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:45.030
We can solve for delta t
using the quadratic formula.

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:50.540
So we get delta t-- and if
this is very unfamiliar to you,

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:53.570
review the videos on Khan
Academy in the algebra playlist

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:54.630
on the quadratic formula.

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:55.550
And if you don't know
where it came from,

00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:57.210
we also prove it for you.

00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:00.950
So it's equal to negative B.
B is this term right here,

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:03.000
the coefficient on the delta t.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.844
So it's going to be negative
90 sine of 53 degrees.

00:10:07.844 --> 00:10:09.510
I'll write the quadratic
formula up here

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:12.870
for those of you who
don't fully remember it.

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:16.750
So if I'm trying to
solve Ax squared plus Bx

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:20.050
plus C is equal to 0,
the roots over here

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:24.600
are going to be negative B plus
or minus the square root of B

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:31.940
squared minus 4AC, all
of that over 2 times A.

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:33.700
These are going to
be the x values that

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:36.114
satisfy this equation up here.

00:10:36.114 --> 00:10:37.530
So that's all I'm
doing over here.

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:38.660
This is the B value.

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:43.159
Negative B plus or
minus-- and it's

00:10:43.159 --> 00:10:45.450
going to turn out that we
only care about the plus one,

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:47.590
because that's going to
give us the positive value.

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:48.923
But I'll just write it out here.

00:10:48.923 --> 00:10:53.810
Plus or minus the square
root of B squared.

00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:56.060
So it's this quantity squared.

00:10:56.060 --> 00:11:03.610
So it is 90 sine of 53
degrees squared, minus 4--

00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:05.770
we're going to run
[? out that ?] little space.

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:16.120
So minus 4 times A,
which is negative 4.9.

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:21.130
Well, let me just write negative
4.9 times C. C over here

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:23.065
is 16, times 16.

00:11:23.065 --> 00:11:25.350
Let me put this radical
all the way over here.

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:26.720
All of that over 2A.

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.600
So A is negative 4.9.

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:37.800
2 times A is negative 9.8.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:40.110
So now we can get
the calculator out

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:41.604
to figure out our
change in time.

00:11:41.604 --> 00:11:44.020
And I'm just going to focus
on the positive version of it.

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:45.810
I'll leave it up to you to
find the negative version

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:48.101
and see that it'll give you
a negative value for change

00:11:48.101 --> 00:11:48.690
in time.

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:50.370
And that's
nonsensical, so we only

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:52.080
care about the
positive change in time

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:58.290
where we get to a displacement
of negative 16 meters.

00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:00.470
Let's get the calculator out.

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:03.770
So we get-- want to
do this carefully.

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:09.809
We have negative 90
sine of 53 degrees plus.

00:12:09.809 --> 00:12:12.100
I'm doing the plus version
here because that'll give us

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:17.320
the positive value--
plus the square root of.

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.680
And I'll do this in parentheses.

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:23.730
90 sine of 53 degrees squared.

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:25.400
That's that part right there.

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:26.830
These two negatives cancel out.

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:29.840
So I could say this is
plus 4 times positive 4.9.

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:37.450
So plus 4 times 4.9 times 16.

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:40.630
And then that closes
off our entire radical.

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:43.710
And so this will give me
the numerator up here.

00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:44.900
That gives me the numerator.

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:53.580
And then I want to divide that
by-- did I do the negative 90?

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:55.710
Oh, and I just realized
that I made a mistake.

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:59.240
I said that the positive
version would give you

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:00.040
the positive time.

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:01.373
But now we realize that's wrong.

00:13:01.373 --> 00:13:03.960
Because when I took the positive
version, when I put a plus up

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:07.960
here, I get a positive
2.14 for the numerator.

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:10.810
But then we divide
it by negative 9.8.

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:12.310
We're going to get
a negative value.

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:14.560
So that's not going to be
the time that we care about.

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.950
We care about the time where
this is a negative value.

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:19.340
So let me re-enter that.

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:20.860
So let me do the negative value.

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:24.580
So let me move
back a little bit.

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:31.979
And then let me replace
this with a minus sign.

00:13:31.979 --> 00:13:33.770
So I'm going to look
at the negative value,

00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:35.660
because I want
the positive time.

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:38.559
And so now my numerator
here is a negative value.

00:13:38.559 --> 00:13:40.350
And so this is actually
what we care about.

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:42.850
We care about the
numerator's a negative value.

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:49.760
You divide by
negative 9.8, and you

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:55.530
get 14.8-- I'll just
round-- 14.89 seconds.

00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:58.500
So delta t, the
positive version,

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:01.920
is equal to 14.89 seconds.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:05.832
And so my initial comment about
using the positive version

00:14:05.832 --> 00:14:08.290
was wrong because we have this
denominator that's negative.

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:10.640
So you want the
numerator to be negative.

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:12.370
And only when the
numerator is negative

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:14.520
will the whole
expression be positive.

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:18.052
And so we got this positive
time of 14.89 seconds.

00:14:18.052 --> 00:14:19.260
I'm going to leave you there.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.094
And the next part of
the video-- actually, I

00:14:21.094 --> 00:14:23.509
might as well just solve it
instead of making a new video.

00:14:23.509 --> 00:14:24.960
Although this is running long.

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:31.800
So the amount of time that we're
in the air is 14.89 seconds.

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:36.192
So if I were to ask you the
horizontal displacement,

00:14:36.192 --> 00:14:37.650
it's going to be
the amount of time

00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:42.130
we're in the air times your
constant horizontal velocity.

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:45.090
And we already figured out our
constant horizontal velocity.

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:49.700
So if you want to figure
out how far along the x-axis

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:54.210
we get displaced, we
just take this time

00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:57.730
times-- that just means
our previous answer--

00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:04.050
times this value right here,
times 90 cosine of 53 degrees.

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:06.760
And that gives 806 meters.

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:11.323
So this displacement right
over here is 806 meters.
