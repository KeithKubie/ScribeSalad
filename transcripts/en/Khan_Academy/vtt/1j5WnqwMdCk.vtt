00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.370
Let's say I've got some
basis B, and it's

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:05.790
made up of k vectors.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:12.050
Let's say it's v1, v2,
all the way to vk.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.830
Let's say I have some vector
a, and I know what a's

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.600
coordinates are with
respect to B.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:26.490
So this is the coordinates of
a with respect to B are c1,

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.800
c2, and I'm going to have k
coordinates, because we have k

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.780
basis vectors.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.645
Or if this describes a
subspace, this is a

00:00:34.645 --> 00:00:36.670
k-dimensional subspace.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.790
So I'm going to have k of
these guys right there.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.740
All this means, by our
definition of coordinates with

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.970
respect to a basis, this
literally means that I can

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:54.210
represent my vector a as a
linear combination of these

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.120
guys, where these coordinates
are the weights.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:04.709
So a would be equal to c1 times
v1, plus c2 times v2,

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:07.030
plus all the way, keep adding
them up, all the

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.250
way to ck times vk.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.080
Now, another way to write
this is that-- let me

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.160
write it this way.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.590
If I had a matrix where the
column vectors were the basis

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.660
vectors of B-- so let me write
it just like that.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.190
So let me see I have some matrix
C that looks like this,

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.820
where its column vectors are
just these basis vectors.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:39.230
So we have v1, v2, all
the way to vk.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.990
If we assume that all of these
are a member of Rn, then each

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.870
of these are going to have n
entries, or it's going to an n

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.130
by k matrix.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.670
Each of these guys
have n entries.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.800
So we're going to have n rows,
and we have k columns.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.220
So let's imagine this
matrix right there.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.450
Another way to write this
expression right there, is to

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:11.670
say that a is equal to the
vector c1, c2, all the way to

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.520
ck, multiplied by this
matrix right there.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.210
This would be equal to a.

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.650
This statement over here and
this expression over here are

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:25.620
completely identical.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.110
If I take this matrix vector
product, what do I get?

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:36.250
I get c1 times v1, plus c2 times
v2, plus c3 times v3,

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.960
all the way to ck times
vk, is equal to a.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.950
We've seen this multiple
times in

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.860
multiple different contexts.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.710
But what's interesting
here is this

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.390
expression is the same thing.

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.710
And really I'm just applying new
words to things that we've

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.350
seen probably 100
times by now.

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.750
We can rewrite this
expression.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.530
This is C-- and remember C is
just a matrix with our basis

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.400
vectors as columns-- C
is equal to this guy.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.210
This is just the coordinates
of a with respect

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:05.750
to the basis B.

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.320
So C times the vector that has
the coordinates of the vector

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.330
a with respect to the basis B.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.245
That is going to
be equal to a.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.510
Now, why did I go through the
trouble of doing this?

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.820
Because now you have a fairly
straightforward way of-- if I

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.760
were to give you this, if I were
to give you that right

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:36.600
there, and say, hey, what is a,
if I wanted to write it in

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.710
standard coordinates, or with
respect to the standard basis?

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.120
Which is just kind of
the way we've been

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.560
writing vectors all along?

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.140
Then you just multiply it times
this matrix C, this

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.750
matrix that has the basis
vectors as columns.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:55.490
The other way, if you have some
vector a that you know

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:59.010
can be represented as a linear
combination of B, or it's in

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.920
the span of these basis vectors,
then you could solve

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.540
for this guy right here to
figure out a's coordinates

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.520
with respect to B.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.200
So this little matrix right
here, what does it do?

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.730
It helps us change bases.

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.230
If you multiply it times this
guy, you're going from the

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.040
vector represented by
coordinates with respect to

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.100
some basis, and you multiply
it times this guy, you're

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.430
going to get to the vector
just with standard

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.840
coordinates.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:35.360
So we call this matrix right
here change of basis matrix,

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.020
which sounds very fancy.

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.090
But all it literally is is a
matrix with the basis vectors

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.970
as columns.

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.230
Let's just apply this a little
bit to see if we can do

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.400
anything vaguely constructive
with it.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.130
Let's say that I have
some basis.

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.350
let's say B for basis.

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.440
Let's say I have two vectors.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.930
I'll define the vectors
up here.

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.740
Let's say vector 1, let's say
we're dealing with R3.

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.130
So vector 1 is 1, 2, 3.

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:12.360
And let's say that vector
2 is 1, 0, 1.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.540
And let's say I'm going to
define some basis B as being

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:22.060
the set of the vectors
v1 and v2.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.800
I'll leave it to you to verify
that these are not linear

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.390
combinations of each other,
so this is a valid basis.

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.740
These aren't in any way
linearly dependent.

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.050
Now, let's say that I know some
vector that's in the span

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:36.300
of these guys.

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:41.700
All I know is how it happens
to be represented in

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.710
coordinates with respect
to this basis.

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.620
So let's say I have
some vector a.

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:51.840
And when I represent the
coordinates of a with respect

00:05:51.840 --> 00:06:02.800
to this basis, it's equal
to 7, 7, minus 4.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.410
So how can we represent this
guy in its standard

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.390
coordinates?

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:12.410
What is a equal to?

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:17.990
Well, you could just say a is
equal to 7 times v1, minus 4

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:20.720
times v2, and you'd be
completely correct.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.660
But let's actually use this
change of basis matrix that

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.490
I've introduced you
to in this video.

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:30.820
So the change of basis matrix
here is going to be just a

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:35.880
matrix with v1 and v2 as
its columns, 1, 2, 3,

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.550
and then 1, 0, 1.

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:43.000
And then if we multiply our
change of basis matrix times

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.340
the vector representation with
respect to that basis, so

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:57.220
times 7 minus 4, we're going to
get the vector represented

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.080
in standard coordinates.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.650
So what is this going
to be equal to?

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:05.810
We have a 3 by 2 matrix,
times a 2 by 1.

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:10.420
We're going to get a 3 by 1
matrix, which makes complete

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:11.680
sense because we're
dealing in R3.

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:19.130
a is going to be member of R3.

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:20.970
So when we write it with
standard coordinates, we

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:23.680
should have 3 coordinates
right there.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.520
Now when we represented a with
respect to the basis, we only

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:30.420
had two coordinates, because a
was in the plane spanned by

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:31.230
these two guys.

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:35.460
Actually this is a good
excuse to draw this.

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:37.270
So let me draw it in
three dimensions.

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:39.790
Let's say the span of v1
and v2 looks like this.

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:48.390
Let's say this is the 0
vector right there.

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:54.620
So this right here is the
span of v1 and v2.

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:57.290
Or another way, this is
the subspace that B

00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:59.210
is the basis for.

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:01.490
So we know that a
is in this guy.

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:07.390
So let's say v1 looks like this,
and that v2-- I'm not

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:09.810
even looking at the numbers,
I'm just doing it fairly

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:16.960
abstract-- let's say v2 looks
like this right here.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:20.150
Now, the fact that a can be
represented as a linear

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:23.240
combination of v1 and v2, tells
us that a is also going

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:26.060
to be in this plane in R3.

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:32.500
In fact, it's 7 times v1,
so it's 1 v1, 1 v1's, 3

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:35.549
v1's, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:38.390
So it's 7 in that direction, and
then it's minus 4 in the

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:39.070
v2 direction.

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:40.635
So that's 1 in the
v2 direction.

00:08:40.635 --> 00:08:43.980
This is minus 1 in the v2
direction, minus 2,

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:45.850
minus 3, minus 4.

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:50.470
Or we can do it here,
1, 2, 3, 4.

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:54.390
So our vector a is going
to look like this.

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:57.470
It's going to sit
on the plane.

00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:59.680
So this is our vector a.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.000
It's going to sit
on the plane.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.190
And when we represent it with
respect to this basis, when we

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:06.080
represent these coordinates with
respect to our basis B,

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.850
we say oh OK, it's
7 of this guy.

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:10.060
I'm just doing this
abstractly.

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:11.570
Don't pay attention to
the numbers just now.

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:13.480
I just want you to understand
the idea.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:17.500
We said it's 7 of this guy,
minus 4 of this guy.

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:18.590
So it takes you back here.

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:20.990
And you get this vector,
which is in this plane.

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:23.310
So we only needed two
coordinates to specify it

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:26.290
within this plane, because
this subspace was

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:27.340
two-dimensional.

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:30.430
But we're dealing in R3.

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:33.460
And if we just want the general
version of a in

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:37.030
standard coordinates, we'll have
to essentially get three

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:38.740
coordinates.

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:40.730
I want you to understand that
a is sitting on this plane.

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:43.900
This plane just keeps going on
and on and on in all of these

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:44.430
directions.

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:45.840
a actually sits on that plane.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.070
It's a linear combination of
that guy and that guy.

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:49.550
But let's figure out what
a looks like in standard

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:50.690
coordinates.

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:53.230
In standard coordinates, we get
the first term is going to

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:56.730
be 1 times 7, plus
1 times minus 4.

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:58.710
So that's going to be 3.

00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:01.920
We get 2 times 7, plus
0 times minus 4.

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:03.480
That is 14.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:07.610
You're going to get 3 times
7, plus 1 times minus 4.

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:13.360
So 3 times 7 is 21,
minus 4, is 17.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:17.560
So a is the vector 3, 14, 17.

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:19.430
That is equal to a.

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:22.780
Now let's say we wanted
to go the other way.

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:26.400
Let's say we have some vector--
let me pick a letter

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:29.800
I haven't used recently-- let's
say I have some vector

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:39.190
d, which is 8, minus 6, 2.

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:48.220
And let's say we know that d is
a member of the span of our

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:56.600
basis vectors, the span of v1
and v2, which tells us that d

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.380
can be represented as a linear
combination of these guys, or

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:02.990
that d is in this subspace, or
that d can be represented as

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:06.040
coordinates with respect
to the basis B.

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:13.680
Remember, the basis B was just
equal to the set of v1 and v2.

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.450
That's all that basis B was.

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:22.410
Now, we know that if we have
our change of basis matrix

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:28.610
times the vector made up of
the coordinates, of d with

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:33.660
respect to B-- so let me write
that down, d with respect to

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:37.080
B-- is equal to d.

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:37.680
We know that.

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:40.285
We know if we have this guy's
coordinates and we multiply it

00:11:40.285 --> 00:11:44.270
by the change of basis matrix,
we'll just get the regular

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:46.900
standard coordinate
representation of d.

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:49.370
Now in this case, we have d.

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:50.690
We're given this.

00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:53.450
We of course know what the
change of basis matrix is.

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:57.640
So if we wanted to represent d
in coordinates with respect to

00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:59.940
B, we're going to have to
solve this equation.

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:01.200
So let's do that.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:08.050
So our change of basis matrix
is 1, 1, 2, 0, 3, 1.

00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:10.580
And we're going to have to
multiply it times some

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:11.830
coordinates.

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:14.640
This thing right here, we can
represent it as-- I'll do it

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:18.050
in yellow-- we're going to
need two coordinates.

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:21.180
It's going to be some
multiple of v1, plus

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:22.450
some multiple of v2.

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:24.940
So it's c1, c2.

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:26.870
We know it has to be two
coordinates because this

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:30.210
matrix vector product is only
well-defined if this is a

00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:33.920
member of R2, because this
is a 3 by 2 matrix.

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.190
We have two columns here,
so we have to

00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:36.890
have two entries here.

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:38.895
Then that's going to
be equal to d.

00:12:41.955 --> 00:12:45.530
So we have 8, minus 6, 2.

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:47.940
So if we figure out what this
vector is, we've figured out

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:51.060
what the representation, or
the coordinates of d with

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:52.050
respect to B, are.

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:53.300
So let's solve this.

00:12:56.030 --> 00:13:01.150
So to solve this, we can just
set up an augmented matrix.

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:02.940
That's just our traditional
way of

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:04.610
solving a linear equation.

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:11.340
So we have 1, 1, 2, 0, 3, 1.

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:13.740
We augment it with this
side right there.

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:17.850
So we have 8, minus 6, and 2.

00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:20.490
And let's keep my first
row the same.

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:24.560
So I have 1, 1, augmented
it with 8.

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:30.940
And let's replace my second row
with the second row minus

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:33.070
2 times the first row.

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:36.770
So I'm going to get 2 minus 2
times 1 is-- actually, let me

00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:37.400
do it the other way.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.360
Let me replace my second row
with 2 times my first row,

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:42.130
minus my second row.

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:45.990
So two times 1, minus 2, is 0.

00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:50.650
2 times 1, minus 0, is 2.

00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:55.390
2 times 8 is 16,
minus 6, is 10.

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:59.960
Now let's replace the third
row with 3 times the first

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:01.820
row, minus the third row.

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:05.190
So 3 times 1, minus 3, is 0.

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:09.660
3 times 1, minus 1, is 2.

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:23.290
And then 3 times 8 is 24, minus
2, is going to be 22.

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:25.540
See it looks like I must have
made a mistake someplace,

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:28.180
because I have these two would
lead to no solutions.

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:30.640
Let me verify what I did, make
sure that I didn't make any

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:31.990
strange errors.

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:34.950
So the second row, I replaced it
with 2 times the first row,

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:36.110
minus the second row.

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:39.740
So 2 times 1, minus 2, is 0.

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:41.920
2 times 1, minus 0, is 2.

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:46.620
2 times 8, minus minus 6-- so
there's my error-- that's

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:49.230
equal to 22.

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:49.790
That was my error.

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:51.080
So these two things
are equivalent.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.305
I'll do one step at a time.

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:03.910
Let me replace my third row with
my third row, minus my

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:05.260
second row, just get
it out of the way.

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:11.130
So I"ll keep this 1,
1, 8, 0, 2, 22.

00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:14.570
And then the third row, I'm
going to replace it with my

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:16.110
third row, minus
my second row.

00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:18.130
So it's going to be 0, 0, 0.

00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:20.200
So that just gets zeroed out.

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:25.260
Now let me divide my
second row by 2.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:28.060
So I get 1, 1, and 8.

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:31.250
And then this one becomes
0, 1, and 11.

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:34.470
Then of course the third row
is just a bunch of 0's.

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:38.300
Then let me keep my middle
row the same.

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:42.290
So it's 0, 1, and 11.

00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:45.790
Then let me replace my first
with my first row, minus my

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:46.770
middle row.

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:48.950
So 1 minus 0 is 1.

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:51.070
1 minus 1 is 0.

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:53.600
8 minus 11 is minus 3.

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:55.540
And I'll keep my last
row the same.

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:58.550
So I put the left-hand side in
reduced row echelon form.

00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:59.960
So this right here
is essentially

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:01.210
telling me my solution.

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:05.830
So I could write it this way.

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:18.480
I could write that 1, 0, 0, 1,
0, 0 times c1, c2 is equal to

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:21.030
minus 3, 11, 0.

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:25.420
Or another way of writing this,
is that 1 times c1, plus

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:30.060
0 times c2, or c1, is
equal to minus 3.

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:42.700
Then we have 0 times c1, plus
1 times c2 is going to be

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:45.510
equal to 11.

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:53.350
So our solution to this equation
is minus 3, 11.

00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:56.900
Or another way of saying this,
is that if I wanted to write

00:16:56.900 --> 00:17:01.470
my vector d in coordinates with
respect to my basis B, it

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:19.319
would be the coordinates minus
3, 11, which implies-- let me

00:17:19.319 --> 00:17:23.060
write it this way-- which
implies that d is equal to

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:27.670
minus 3 times vector 1, plus
11, times vector 2.

00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:30.520
I'll leave that for
you to verify.

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:34.190
But just like that, using this
change of basis matrix, we can

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:35.130
go back and forth.

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:37.270
If you have this representation,
it's very easy

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:39.540
to take the product and
get the standard

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:40.990
representation for d.

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:43.700
If you have the standard
representation or the

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:45.780
coordinates with respect
to the standard

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:47.310
basis, it's very easy.

00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:48.830
Well, it's a little
more involved.

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:50.870
But then you just solve
for your coordinates

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:53.930
with respect to B.
