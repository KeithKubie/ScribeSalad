WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.550
And boom. Right when you take a drink of water, that's when we go live.

2
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.500
Always good to see you. Good to see. Thanks for having me Bro. My pleasure.

3
00:00:10.501 --> 00:00:11.310
I'm a big fan.

4
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.820
I've been a fan for a long time and I'm very excited about this Bahari rematch.

5
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.420
So we were just talking about it. That's going to be in December. Yes sir. Yeah,

6
00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.230
it's going to be huge is I think is going to be the biggest fight in kickboxing

7
00:00:22.231 --> 00:00:23.610
history. I think it's already,

8
00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.690
I mean you were just saying that the tickets go on presale today I think. Yeah,

9
00:00:27.691 --> 00:00:32.550
today or tomorrow. So, um, where is it going to be held? It's in Holland.

10
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.630
It's going to be in Holland. Yeah. It's called the hell the dough.

11
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.850
And how many seats is that?

12
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.100
I believe around 25. 30,000. Wow.

13
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.940
That's crazy. How big kickboxing is in Holland is a para post to America. Yeah,

14
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.470
it's Holland. Europe. It's a lot bigger than it is here.

15
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.570
So we I d I do not for the life of me understand why it hasn't taken off in

16
00:00:57.571 --> 00:01:00.920
America. I don't get it. Well, I think it,

17
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.940
the step of going to MMA than to kickboxing.

18
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.730
It's so much close to people. For example, from high school,

19
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.290
it's so much more logical when you do wrestling, do a little bit of boxing.

20
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.610
Well let's jump into MMA that because it's so close to each other and when you

21
00:01:17.611 --> 00:01:21.540
go to kickbox it's totally different. Right? It's slightly different.

22
00:01:21.541 --> 00:01:26.510
So many people in America when they watch MMA, they want guys to stand up. Yeah,

23
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.800
I know. That's why it doesn't make any sense still.

24
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.550
I think like every country is like very patriotic.

25
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.290
They want their own guys to be very good at something sort of.

26
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.610
But like when Anderson Silva was at the top of the heap in MMA,

27
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.450
everybody wanted to see him fight. Yeah.

28
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.380
It didn't matter that he was from Brazil. Yeah, that's true. In America.

29
00:01:46.381 --> 00:01:47.850
They still wanted to see him fight. He's just,

30
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.680
they want to see high level stuff.

31
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.710
It's just everyone here is such a fan of knockouts and and striking and high

32
00:01:54.901 --> 00:01:58.130
level striking. I just don't understand it. No more tied to you.

33
00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.150
My tie doesn't sell at all. No. You mean there's no big Moitai events.

34
00:02:03.151 --> 00:02:08.151
Like they had a pro Moitai league event here and it was in like Nicky hold skin

35
00:02:10.231 --> 00:02:14.390
fought on it and um, bull cow and a,

36
00:02:14.391 --> 00:02:18.210
a few other big name guys. Um, fought on it. But it was like, you know,

37
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.570
nobody in the crowd. No. But Shell is also like Moitai so,

38
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.520
so with the clinching and they hold to it, it's like,

39
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.660
I think it's a little bit boring.

40
00:02:27.661 --> 00:02:32.580
Like w what we do with glory now is it's like more commercial.

41
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.390
You can hold like just for three, three seconds, right.

42
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.340
And then break and then continue fighting. So, and in the end,

43
00:02:41.341 --> 00:02:45.750
that's what people want to see. I get that. But I like clinch work too.

44
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.410
And I like elbows, elbows and knees and the clinch. You don't like it.

45
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.060
I like the knees, but no, too many caught that nasty.

46
00:02:54.061 --> 00:02:57.710
Yeah. Nasty. So cots are nasty. Yeah. So I had,

47
00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.360
what do you think about how liked the amateur when we tie guys have elbow pads?

48
00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.980
[inaudible] that's,

49
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.250
I think that's probably in all this preventive for people who don't understand

50
00:03:06.251 --> 00:03:07.084
what we're talking about.

51
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.410
It's weird that like we see you could t you could see with bare knuckle boxing,

52
00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.380
like there's a lot of bare knuckle boxing matches now and you see these guys

53
00:03:14.381 --> 00:03:18.280
faces are just getting destroyed as, I mean they just ripped apart. It's crazy.

54
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.860
It's not healthy. No it's not.

55
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.860
It's definitely not good for the longevity of your career. No.

56
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.240
And so in Amateur Moitai they have these elbow pads that they wear and that

57
00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:31.210
would mean your still can knock guys out just as easily,

58
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.990
but you're not going to get the cuts. Exactly. Cut to the bed. That's it.

59
00:03:34.991 --> 00:03:39.010
That's a good thing. Yeah. But I'm just not a big fan of a, of the elbow,

60
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.690
the elbow work. But I love to see it, but I like to get it.

61
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.400
Cause I remember, I remember, I remember, uh, I was, I was, I wasn't,

62
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.550
I don't think I was training with the black zillions like years ago.

63
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.510
I think it was even before I, I became champion and I was training,

64
00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.010
they're doing a little bit of MMA,

65
00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.420
helping some guys out and I was training and somebody could just,

66
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.880
he said on accident, he just pop through loe right on the nose.

67
00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.460
He just opened it up just a little bit and ask him, what the hell are you doing?

68
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.110
Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Yeah, cause accident. Yeah, that accident.

69
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:22.810
So we'll give them a few extra low kicks after that. And MMA, I mean,

70
00:04:22.811 --> 00:04:26.410
it's such a staple technique, you know, it's probably hard to not do it.

71
00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.760
Even had a couple of them I may fights. Right honey? One, just one. Yeah.

72
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.520
You mounted the guy. That was what was crazy tipped to the ground. I was like,

73
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.560
let's, let's give it a try. When winter we got to try everything.

74
00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.220
But when I saw it I was like, damn, if he makes his way to MMA,

75
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.940
because the heavyweight division, particularly in the UFC is extremely shallow,

76
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.880
extremely shallow. I mean you have some great talent,

77
00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.570
but there's like four or five really good fighters. You know, it's like,

78
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.540
there's obviously Cormier gay, there's steep pay, Frances and Gano.

79
00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.240
There's a few other guys, but it's you, you know, with a couple of wins,

80
00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.630
you're in the mix for a heavyweight title shot. Yeah. You know,

81
00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:05.770
have you your thought about doing that?

82
00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.660
I thought about it because he's still young. Right? How old are you? 30. Yeah.

83
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.330
See which is crazy because you've had a lot of fights, right? Yeah.

84
00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.370
I had about 60, 70 fights. Yeah. That's crazy. You know,

85
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.930
and it's, um, and,

86
00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:25.890
but the thing is as European like fighting and glory, like it's uh,

87
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.160
that's what people don't understand. It is enormous overseas.

88
00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:33.880
It's hard for people to, in America they're like, what kickboxing.

89
00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.310
But if you go to see those events, I mean, I watch all of them.

90
00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:37.900
You watched the events on television.

91
00:05:37.901 --> 00:05:40.690
It's like fucking crazy packed crowds and always full.

92
00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.320
The first fight you had with barter, Holy Shit. Was that crowd hot?

93
00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:48.910
That was a wild crowd that even like jumped through to the ropes. Everything.

94
00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.410
Everything went crazy so well, it ended in a fucked up way.

95
00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:58.170
You know? Botter said his arm was, what was the, did,

96
00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:01.100
<v 1>did he get an MRI or anything like that? I have no clue.</v>

97
00:06:01.101 --> 00:06:04.580
I'm not from the organization or something. So yeah,

98
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.370
he did some bandage or something over his arm in the neck. He,

99
00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:13.190
because that's what he posted on Instagram. But I don't know. I don't know.

100
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.640
For me it was a, yeah. You know,

101
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:21.050
it was like a anticlimax that wasn't the way I wanted it to end that fight.

102
00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:24.740
Right. But I think for the rest, for, uh,

103
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:28.270
for him this was the perfect way to end the fight because this is the way you

104
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.391
could,

105
00:06:28.391 --> 00:06:33.391
you could get a rematch cause he would have lost no point in doing a rematch if

106
00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:39.820
he would get knocked out. No point in doing the rematch. So, well, my siblings,

107
00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:43.790
I'm really close fight and then you eventually one. Yeah. You know,

108
00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:48.530
but from, from my feeling, uh, everybody said yeah, but uh,

109
00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:52.730
Rico walked into the jabs the first round and everything. That's true.

110
00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:54.950
But I was pressuring him.

111
00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:58.610
I was pressuring him the whole time and I was trying to feel like,

112
00:06:58.611 --> 00:07:02.930
where is my distance? Where I can hit and where I can, where I get hit.

113
00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:07.430
So on of course. That's right. You get tagged. Yeah, you get text sometimes.

114
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:11.000
So my, my nose was already a during training,

115
00:07:11.001 --> 00:07:15.020
my nose opened up so when he hit it, it opened up again. So I was like, yeah,

116
00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.770
it is what it is, you know, like I'm not really bothered by it.

117
00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:22.400
So I went suppression impression and I was like, okay, now I've got,

118
00:07:22.401 --> 00:07:23.234
now I got it.

119
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:28.220
So after that first round and then we jumped into the second round and I was

120
00:07:28.221 --> 00:07:30.890
fit, I was ready for it. I was ready for this fight.

121
00:07:30.891 --> 00:07:35.110
And that's what I like to do. I would like to drag people into the deep waters.

122
00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:39.230
Well, you're very fit for a heavyweight. You have crazy cardio.

123
00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:42.100
That's one of the things that I've always admired about your fighting styles.

124
00:07:42.101 --> 00:07:46.100
So you put insane pressure on guys for heavyweight because heavyweights,

125
00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:51.050
bigger guys tend to fight at a slower pace and less volume. But you,

126
00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:55.220
you push a pace and when the fight gets to third, fourth, and fifth rounds,

127
00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:57.440
you fucking pilot on man. Yeah.

128
00:07:57.441 --> 00:08:02.441
Because I've been training with a light guys for like my whole career.

129
00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:07.670
So when I started the gym, I started that with the Super Pro sports center. Uh,

130
00:08:07.671 --> 00:08:10.220
with Dennis Kerrville. He had, uh, Albert Kraus,

131
00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:14.450
he was the first k one Max champion and he had Elvir Lima,

132
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:19.460
like multiple, a middleweight champion world champion.

133
00:08:19.461 --> 00:08:24.461
So I was working with those guys like every day and they just kept on pressuring

134
00:08:26.001 --> 00:08:28.490
me and like Blah, blah blah blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

135
00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:32.810
I was getting my ass whooped like almost every day by like guys every way,

136
00:08:32.811 --> 00:08:36.980
like 75 kilos. So I was like,

137
00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:42.460
I can keep hitting him to keep hitting those guys hard or just go with less

138
00:08:44.061 --> 00:08:46.370
power and pressure them.

139
00:08:46.371 --> 00:08:49.820
Like they tried to pressure me and of course in the beginning is like still you

140
00:08:49.821 --> 00:08:52.580
get tired, but at a certain moment you get like, hey,

141
00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:56.060
this is going better and we're just nothing to hit them. Yeah.

142
00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:58.050
Don't try to hit them hard,

143
00:08:58.051 --> 00:09:00.510
but just try to keep the work pop up like a machine gun.

144
00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:03.070
<v 2>Is that something that happens in a fight as well?</v>

145
00:09:03.071 --> 00:09:07.110
Where you have to balance out how hard you swing versus like a,

146
00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.680
not going full blast,

147
00:09:08.681 --> 00:09:12.640
but going technical or knowing that you can start on loading in the third,

148
00:09:12.641 --> 00:09:13.474
fourth and fifth rounds,

149
00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:18.480
<v 1>see them fade. But it's, for me it's like I'm playing a game.</v>

150
00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:19.740
For me this is,

151
00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.730
we always say fighting is a thinking man's game because fighting,

152
00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:27.390
everybody can fight when they have to. Everybody can fight.

153
00:09:27.391 --> 00:09:29.880
When doesn't matter what person.

154
00:09:29.881 --> 00:09:34.380
When you put them in a corner and it's life or death, everybody can fight.

155
00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:38.430
But it's, it's so much more than that.

156
00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:43.290
It's so much more than just fighting. So in that dry, how I try to, uh,

157
00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.690
step into the ring with that mentality, like

158
00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:50.570
<v 2>don't understand that who've never competed the managing of the resources is a</v>

159
00:09:50.571 --> 00:09:52.160
big factor. Right?

160
00:09:52.161 --> 00:09:56.840
Like when do you decide to hit the gas and you see like guys in MMA see it with

161
00:09:56.841 --> 00:10:01.280
a guy like Nick Diaz. Like Nick Diaz is famous for not hitting guys hard.

162
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:03.650
He just stays on you. Yeah, he just stays on.

163
00:10:03.651 --> 00:10:07.460
You had a lot of volume and then you get tired and then he starts unloading.

164
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:08.790
Exactly know with big shots.

165
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:12.240
<v 1>So, and that's, that's what I like to do. Um,</v>

166
00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:16.470
the biggest compliment I could get from an opponent, and I had it like from my,

167
00:10:16.471 --> 00:10:21.120
like my last six opponent, I got like three or four times this and like Rico,

168
00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:23.970
now I understand why you are the champion.

169
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:29.630
I fought everybody but this I have never felt before and you're on a different

170
00:10:30.751 --> 00:10:34.170
level. And that's the biggest compliment I could get because I'm in the,

171
00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:39.410
in the ring for five rounds with this guy and they,

172
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:44.750
they got every opportunity to do everything they've trained for with me for five

173
00:10:45.481 --> 00:10:49.290
rounds. So I didn't knock them out. We just fought for five rounds,

174
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:53.400
but they just did not know what to do. And that's, yeah. For me,

175
00:10:53.401 --> 00:10:54.660
the biggest compliment I could get.

176
00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:58.500
<v 2>Yeah. To be technical and to just play your game. Exactly. Yeah.</v>

177
00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:01.290
I really loved your rematch with Jamal.

178
00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:03.570
Ben Sadeek was one of my favorite fights.

179
00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:08.640
<v 1>I believe that it was a great fight that was like the full rocky version of a</v>

180
00:11:10.181 --> 00:11:11.560
fight that people would love to see.

181
00:11:11.561 --> 00:11:13.930
You get tagged in the beginning and then you

182
00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:17.890
<v 2>overwhelmed him and then when you put him away I was like, Holy Shit.</v>

183
00:11:17.891 --> 00:11:21.760
What a fight. What a fight that was. That guys a big mother fucker too. Yeah.

184
00:11:21.761 --> 00:11:22.010
Yeah,

185
00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:24.230
<v 1>there's a big guy and uh,</v>

186
00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:28.940
that I lost against in late back in the days and when I was like,

187
00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:33.970
just a little little kid and so this fight brought something with it as well.

188
00:11:34.401 --> 00:11:38.240
He's like, yeah, he's the champion now, but I beat him, but it was like six,

189
00:11:38.241 --> 00:11:41.420
seven years ago. I'm a totally different fighter than I was back then.

190
00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:46.670
Says let's go. I'm ready for you. So yeah, this was the, the,

191
00:11:46.671 --> 00:11:49.970
the best thing I need. He spit in my face during a press conference.

192
00:11:49.971 --> 00:11:54.640
So I got some extra motivation for that. Well,

193
00:11:54.641 --> 00:11:55.474
you played it out

194
00:11:55.580 --> 00:12:00.290
<v 2>perfectly to where even when he hit you and hurt you early in the fight,</v>

195
00:12:00.291 --> 00:12:04.700
you stayed calm, you didn't get emotional, you use good defense.

196
00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:07.370
And then once you got him into the deep water,

197
00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:09.850
you stopped him in the fourth and the fifth. Fifth round. Yeah.

198
00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:13.490
Once you got him into deep water, then you piled it on and then put them away.

199
00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:16.880
<v 1>Yeah. But then again, it's the same thing for me. Everybody. I said,</v>

200
00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:21.930
how did you do that? You got tagged? And I said, but then again,

201
00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.620
like I said, it's a thinking man's game, right?

202
00:12:24.621 --> 00:12:29.100
I get hit from my point of view, I made a mistake.

203
00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.260
I switched to South Pole,

204
00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:35.160
but instead of switching and stepping outside of his front leg,

205
00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:37.370
I was right in front of his, uh,

206
00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:41.190
of his leg and he was just throwing a left, a left. Right.

207
00:12:41.191 --> 00:12:45.750
And I was walked straight into that. And that's w that's what happened.

208
00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:49.920
It's not that from my point of view that he timed death.

209
00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:55.350
So it happened. And from that moment I can do two things. I can think,

210
00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:56.243
okay,

211
00:12:56.430 --> 00:13:01.110
I can jump into the fight and try to get that point or whatever that moment back

212
00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:04.710
or just thinking my mind like, okay, fuck it.

213
00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:06.420
You lost this round.

214
00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:11.520
Take it and let's go fresh into the second. That's what I did.

215
00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:13.910
So just think about, okay, I lost this round,

216
00:13:13.911 --> 00:13:18.860
but I've got four more to go and I got back into the corner and Motrin says,

217
00:13:18.861 --> 00:13:21.930
Hey, you back. So Yep. Okay. He's tired now.

218
00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:25.630
<v 2>Yeah. When he tried to unload on you,</v>

219
00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:28.170
he emptied out a lot of the gas tank when you had your hurt.

220
00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:30.380
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. So</v>

221
00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:33.690
<v 2>right. Trying to figure out when you can finish and when you [inaudible].</v>

222
00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:36.200
<v 1>Exactly. Yeah. Just stay focused.</v>

223
00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:40.270
They relaxed and of course he hit me with someone with some good shots, but,

224
00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:43.690
well, he's a big powerful guy. Yeah. He's always a dangerous fighter that,

225
00:13:43.691 --> 00:13:47.140
that guy's huge. What is he like six, nine, six 10 or something like that? Yeah.

226
00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.580
Yeah. And then, yeah,

227
00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:53.440
it's huge in like 270 pounds, I think.

228
00:13:53.441 --> 00:13:56.320
Yeah, that's, that's a mother fucker. That's a big motherfucker.

229
00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:00.770
So [inaudible] he's like, yeah, now it's one, one. I said, come on man,

230
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.830
you beat me like six, seven years. [inaudible] yeah, he was.

231
00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:09.670
He had since then, I don't know. He won a tournament last year.

232
00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:13.660
So he'll selling a few. Yeah. So maybe that fight is going to come.

233
00:14:13.661 --> 00:14:17.140
But like I said, now I'm in, uh, like last year,

234
00:14:17.141 --> 00:14:21.760
the 31st of December, my contract was finished with glory.

235
00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:27.460
So we've been in negotiations ever since. So from that moment on,

236
00:14:27.461 --> 00:14:29.380
I said in my last contract,

237
00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:33.370
you guys told me that about our fight was going to happen and it didn't happen.

238
00:14:33.371 --> 00:14:36.280
So that's when I won first gave me the butter fight.

239
00:14:36.281 --> 00:14:38.490
And from that moment on we going to discuss. Yeah.

240
00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:39.920
So Pete does what we're doing.

241
00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:45.090
<v 2>Ford bought her. Hari is one of the biggest names in the sport. Like forever.</v>

242
00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:49.650
He's, he's a guy who he's stopped Alistair Overeem.

243
00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:52.100
He, you know, he's fought k one thought

244
00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:56.470
<v 0>everybody some issue [inaudible] arts mean he, he's a fucking wild man too.</v>

245
00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:01.490
Yeah. You know, but he hasn't fought in high level competition for a long time.

246
00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:04.370
And then he fought you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

247
00:15:04.371 --> 00:15:09.230
So the thing was everybody was, uh, I was beating everybody.

248
00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.740
I was champion and I was beating everybody. People said, yeah, we cause good.

249
00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:17.750
He's the champion. But he hasn't fought, bought her. I was like, Hey,

250
00:15:17.751 --> 00:15:21.050
if he was so unnatural, [inaudible] just said, hey, if he wants to fight,

251
00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:23.990
let's go. But he had been dealing with a bunch of legal trouble.

252
00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:28.610
He had a lot of problems. Yeah. He broke someone's leg in a club. Yeah. A lot.

253
00:15:28.611 --> 00:15:29.960
A lot of shit. Crazy shit.

254
00:15:29.961 --> 00:15:33.590
There's a video of him slapping some guy's face at a hotel.

255
00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:36.620
Imagine that guy slapping your face, your support,

256
00:15:36.621 --> 00:15:39.420
you working behind the counter. Bonner comes in and like you

257
00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:43.360
do everyone here take their Kieser,

258
00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:49.250
which really just tell us yours. Yeah, so, so yeah, he had a bunch of problems,

259
00:15:49.251 --> 00:15:50.690
but then the,

260
00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:53.480
eventually the fight happened because that's the fight that people wanted to

261
00:15:53.481 --> 00:15:54.110
see.

262
00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:59.110
But for me it was just like another fight and then the fight at the end,

263
00:15:59.391 --> 00:16:03.020
the fight ended that way. Yeah, that was too bad. So,

264
00:16:03.021 --> 00:16:07.220
but now we can do it again. Yeah. So the fight was quite awhile ago.

265
00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:10.460
How long ago was that? 2016 yeah,

266
00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:14.270
that's why did it take so long for the rematch of dead?

267
00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:16.460
There was a bunch of stuff going on in between.

268
00:16:16.461 --> 00:16:21.230
And like last year he fought has the Girgis also a good kickbox I believe he's

269
00:16:21.231 --> 00:16:26.231
now doing MMA in Bella tour and he's fought before,

270
00:16:26.331 --> 00:16:29.950
right? Yeah, he fought as before but got disqualified. So that's right.

271
00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:33.950
He stomped him with his stuff around. Yeah. So, so, but after that,

272
00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:38.340
that's so crazy. And then two wild dude. Yeah.

273
00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:42.300
And then after that fight they both got, uh, got uh,

274
00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:47.430
caught with using whatever. Oh, steroids. Yeah. Oh, so,

275
00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:52.040
so they, they both got suspended and I believe Hesty has,

276
00:16:52.041 --> 00:16:56.870
he wasn't suspended, I don't know. But he got suspended til December this year.

277
00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:57.973
So that's why.

278
00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:02.660
How did the fight go the last when he fought last year with a head z? Uh,

279
00:17:02.661 --> 00:17:06.890
he won one wasn't easy, but he one was the last,

280
00:17:06.891 --> 00:17:10.130
I mean a a decision or was it decision? Yeah. Yeah.

281
00:17:10.131 --> 00:17:14.480
So for him that was the first fight since your fight with him in 2016.

282
00:17:14.481 --> 00:17:17.230
Is that it? Yeah, cause he's been,

283
00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:21.870
cause he's had on and off. Yeah. But, um,

284
00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:25.360
and then now he's not training at Mike's gym anymore? No, no, no, no.

285
00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:28.310
Do you know who he's training with? Uh, I don't remember his name,

286
00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:32.360
but I know I know the guy, but don't always training with,

287
00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:36.580
well he looks good on Instagram for sure. It looks very fat. A lot of people,

288
00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:40.970
a lot of people look good on Instagram. You know that you see me real life,

289
00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:45.500
it looked totally different. Well I'm sure he looks the same, but it's, it's uh,

290
00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:49.980
what's interesting is when your in high level competition, like

291
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:51.720
<v 2>he was of course in, you know,</v>

292
00:17:51.721 --> 00:17:55.110
the days when he fought Alster before Alster made the transition full time to

293
00:17:55.111 --> 00:17:59.820
MMA. Um, when he, before he came to Strikeforce and all that stuff. That's,

294
00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:01.790
that's a long time ago. Yeah. You know,

295
00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:05.670
it's probably hard to get back in. I mean,

296
00:18:05.671 --> 00:18:10.671
and to jump straight into top level competition like headsy or especially like

297
00:18:10.981 --> 00:18:14.550
fighting you as a champion. That's a big leap. Right? Yeah.

298
00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:19.930
<v 1>So, but that's the thing now we both have, so he fought last year,</v>

299
00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:23.470
March and I fought last year, September.

300
00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:28.980
So because I'm was in negotiated and still am in negotiations with glory for new

301
00:18:29.291 --> 00:18:32.680
contract. So it's a, it's both been a while for us,

302
00:18:32.681 --> 00:18:36.180
but I've been before that, I was like in my crazy,

303
00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:37.990
crazy active flow.

304
00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:41.230
<v 2>Yeah, you definitely have much more momentum and just,</v>

305
00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:44.470
there's a thing about fighting too, when guys take a long time off,

306
00:18:44.471 --> 00:18:49.390
it's almost like they, they lose the feel for it. Yeah. They lose,

307
00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:52.900
you know how obviously they know how to kick, they know how to punch,

308
00:18:52.901 --> 00:18:54.520
they know what to do. They're in shape,

309
00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:57.630
but there's a field that they have for the ring.

310
00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:02.320
<v 1>Exactly. Exactly. This, that this is where people don't. And I said like, Hey,</v>

311
00:19:02.321 --> 00:19:04.510
you stepped into the ring and that's what, that's what you do.

312
00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:06.940
This is what you were born to do. That's true.

313
00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:10.080
But you need that attention.

314
00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:14.830
You need to have five of walking towards the ring, stepping into the ring.

315
00:19:14.831 --> 00:19:17.440
All those people looking at you at that moment.

316
00:19:17.441 --> 00:19:22.060
That's a certain type of feeling that you get and you gotta be comfortable with

317
00:19:22.061 --> 00:19:24.160
it. Yeah. And that, that's exactly what it is.

318
00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:28.180
You gotta feel comfortable and the only way you can be comfortable and stay

319
00:19:28.181 --> 00:19:29.710
comfortable is being active.

320
00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:33.060
<v 2>Yes. Being active. It's very, it's, it's just so critical for a fighter when,</v>

321
00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:36.960
when a guy takes a year off or two years off, or three, I mean it's like oof.

322
00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:40.900
The more the time is, the more it becomes problematic. Yeah. Yeah.

323
00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:45.370
<v 1>And the older you get [inaudible] how old is bother now? 35 I think.</v>

324
00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:50.920
[inaudible] so yeah, just glory drug test. Yeah, they do.

325
00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:54.940
That's how they got caught. Was it him or was it an athletic commission? I mean,

326
00:19:54.941 --> 00:19:58.290
was it Gloria or was it a no, it's not glory. It's an induction.

327
00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:01.840
Local look at Dutch athletic club and so they're going to drug test for this

328
00:20:01.841 --> 00:20:05.950
fight as well. Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure. So I got tested like every,

329
00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:08.380
every time. Is it like why the testing?

330
00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:12.720
Like the same standards like world [inaudible]. Yeah.

331
00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:16.830
So they like wake you up like seven o'clock in the morning. Hey Rico. Oh No, no,

332
00:20:16.831 --> 00:20:19.960
no, no. That's not the testing we did. Just, that's at the events.

333
00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:24.780
I would even rather have that you just wake up and random come to us.

334
00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:26.890
But that's not what they, they do that. But that,

335
00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:30.610
that's like really strict when you, when you're there. Yeah, that's,

336
00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:33.850
that's a little bit easier to pass though. That's true.

337
00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:36.400
That's a lot easier to pass I should say. I have no clue.

338
00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:39.760
I don't know what to do or what ways that are too,

339
00:20:39.761 --> 00:20:42.880
because I'm not on it. I don't want to stay busy.

340
00:20:42.881 --> 00:20:45.640
I don't want to think about it. Right. But whatever, you know,

341
00:20:45.641 --> 00:20:48.610
I just jump in there, just do what I gotta do.

342
00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:54.180
But that's why I told glory now and again after this whole issue,

343
00:20:54.821 --> 00:20:59.290
because a lot of people were caught like last year and they didn't expect that.

344
00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:00.161
I was like, hey,

345
00:21:00.161 --> 00:21:05.161
we gotta keep doing this because this is the way we make the sports clean.

346
00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:10.660
And I think that's what we deserve because we, yeah, we are,

347
00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:15.610
we are a good sport. We are all athletes, but I want to be safe in the ring.

348
00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:18.720
And what do you mean with safe? You're going into a fight. I understand.

349
00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:23.730
But somebody that uses whatever can maybe just punch a little bit harder in the

350
00:21:24.671 --> 00:21:28.280
beginning of the fight or whatever. I have a little more endurance. Exactly.

351
00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:31.060
You with some punches they wouldn't be able to hit you with than on some shit.

352
00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:33.820
Exactly. So that's what I mean, uh,

353
00:21:33.821 --> 00:21:37.240
with telling Gloria I want to be safe when I'm in the ring. Well, for sure.

354
00:21:37.241 --> 00:21:41.740
I mean if, if one person's on it and one person's not, that's, you know,

355
00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:45.580
it's a, it's a giant advantage and anybody says it's not,

356
00:21:45.581 --> 00:21:49.960
it's just lying to themselves. Yeah. Yeah. So, but um, in the end, you know,

357
00:21:49.961 --> 00:21:53.080
I just go in there and I'm not even thinking about it,

358
00:21:53.610 --> 00:21:55.990
but it is the fight to make and kickboxing too.

359
00:21:55.991 --> 00:21:59.670
And if there's a fight that I could tell people, hey, you gotta watch you,

360
00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:02.770
you really want to know what kickboxing all about. Watch this, fight this,

361
00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:05.560
that is the fight. Because bots are such a wild man.

362
00:22:05.561 --> 00:22:08.650
He's such a knockout artist and you obviously one of the most successful

363
00:22:08.651 --> 00:22:11.290
heavyweights ever. You know, I mean your a,

364
00:22:11.291 --> 00:22:14.710
your kickboxing record and glory and just the highlight reels. Amazing.

365
00:22:14.711 --> 00:22:16.440
You've got so many great fights over there. Yeah.

366
00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:19.690
Been doing so good and really enjoying myself. And that's what I said.

367
00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:22.480
I want to bring kickboxing to a new level.

368
00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:25.510
Like especially when you go now in Holland,

369
00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:30.930
like normally in Holland was like soccer or whatever,

370
00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:33.100
cycling or ice skating.

371
00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:36.250
That's where parents were bring their kids through and do that,

372
00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:40.480
do Kayvon kickboxing and now they're like, hey kick buck. This is cool.

373
00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:44.800
When we got chosen I think like two, three years ago,

374
00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:47.770
what made the change? I think uh,

375
00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:51.610
because of the bother fight that was so we were getting,

376
00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:56.650
we were getting more airtime and after the bonafide and everything that happened

377
00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:59.050
around him and there was surrounding him,

378
00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:03.100
like w w the thing that you said would happen outside in the club and this and

379
00:23:03.101 --> 00:23:04.540
that. He was like

380
00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:09.720
the National Asshole Ryan and I was like the national good guy cause everybody

381
00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:13.780
so and that was like the perfect clash. And then of course,

382
00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:18.730
yeah I beat him. So everybody was like, Oh shit, these are heroes.

383
00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:23.020
Right. So that, that's actually, that's how everything a little bit exploded.

384
00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:26.710
But, um, but again, for you that's unsatisfying the way it happened.

385
00:23:26.711 --> 00:23:28.830
All that he gets his arm injured. Yeah.

386
00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:33.460
In whatever way reason or whatever he thinks happened.

387
00:23:33.461 --> 00:23:36.970
But like you cause you're suspicious about suspicious about it.

388
00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:40.930
So because he's looking at one arm, then looking at the other arm and it just,

389
00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:43.280
it's a vague thing for me, but it's like,

390
00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:47.690
but that's what I have with whole thing that he tries to create.

391
00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:52.670
It's like when he's getting announced and everything, he's like, yeah,

392
00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:58.370
Butter Hari 110 something fights and 90 knockouts.

393
00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:03.590
But I'm obsessed with what I'm doing. Um, uh, when I'm,

394
00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:06.410
when I fight and when I have an opponent and I'm fighting,

395
00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:08.630
I'm looking for everything.

396
00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:13.660
I want to know everything about you and everything these days you can find on

397
00:24:15.081 --> 00:24:18.380
the Internet. So when I'm looking on the Internet for example,

398
00:24:18.381 --> 00:24:22.160
you look at Wikipedia and he looking all, all the fights from back in the days,

399
00:24:22.161 --> 00:24:26.630
k one days. And even before that you maybe get to 60 70 fights.

400
00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:30.290
So where are the other fights?

401
00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:35.120
Does that mean like when you were younger in the youth period,

402
00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:39.080
you did like 40 something fights and they do knock everybody up.

403
00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:40.340
I Dunno,

404
00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:44.750
my train has been there for years even before that and he doesn't know about it.

405
00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:49.750
So that's strange because everything is documented and on the Internet,

406
00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:54.380
everything you can find on the Internet. So, so thing is records inflated?

407
00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:59.110
I think so. He's got some crazy knockout stuff. He got it. Yeah,

408
00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:04.280
the Stefan Leko [inaudible] experience. But that's what I said he got,

409
00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:08.600
he, he, he's got that, he's got amazing records. But yeah,

410
00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:12.680
I think it's not as crazy as they make it to be,

411
00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:17.450
which is crazy because the, the reality is pretty crazy. I mean,

412
00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:20.360
you don't need to hype it up anymore than it really is, right.

413
00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:22.140
Nobody's been there for years. Like, Hey,

414
00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:26.360
you did 100 something fights or so many knockouts. But when I look at it,

415
00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:31.860
if I can't find it because, but maybe it's there, maybe it's that,

416
00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:34.100
maybe it's from years ago or whatever. I don't know,

417
00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:36.530
but that's all that I'm looking at. You're suspicious.

418
00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:39.680
I'm suspicious about it because when I look at Wikipedia and I'm looking at when

419
00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:44.510
he was around, it starts from when he was around 16 till now it's like 60,

420
00:25:44.511 --> 00:25:46.910
70 fights. It's funny when you look at them in the early days too.

421
00:25:46.911 --> 00:25:50.860
He was so skinny. Yeah. Like even when he fought stuff, I'm like, oh yeah.

422
00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:53.350
And then now he's fucking jacked. Yeah.

423
00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:56.210
But he puts so much time into a strength,

424
00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:59.630
strength and conditioning workouts you could see like he's always doing some

425
00:25:59.631 --> 00:26:01.970
crazy strength routine. Yeah. Yeah.

426
00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:05.950
So do you do a lot of strength and conditioning? Like what, what are,

427
00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:09.080
what are your workouts like as opposed to like how much skill work do you do and

428
00:26:09.081 --> 00:26:10.560
how much strength and conditioning work? Uh,

429
00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:13.520
I think it's pretty even balanced out. I think, uh,

430
00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:15.800
I train strength like three times a week,

431
00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:21.190
but even my strength and thing is so balanced out with doing,

432
00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:27.680
strengthening the same, uh, muscle group. I also do conditioning.

433
00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:32.800
So first I do low reps and then I do a lot of reps because these muscles are for

434
00:26:34.251 --> 00:26:38.510
me, aren't supposed to be big. They need to be strong and they can be,

435
00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:43.680
they need to be making the same punch 50 times with the same strength,

436
00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:48.570
right. 10 Times really hard, no 50 times on the same strengths, the same level.

437
00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:53.220
So that's how we approached that. And then yeah, uh,

438
00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:57.350
we got skilled training like two, three times a week. Uh,

439
00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:59.220
like pad work. Uh,

440
00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:04.250
I got explosive training so I try to always look also at different sports at

441
00:27:05.131 --> 00:27:10.131
soccer and American football and at ice skating and they all have a certain type

442
00:27:11.101 --> 00:27:15.390
of explosiveness that they train in a certain way.

443
00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:19.950
So I tried to pick everything from everywhere and work with that.

444
00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:23.970
So we created a training that we just use for explosive,

445
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.230
for being explosive.

446
00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:30.470
So it has nothing to do with endurance because it's maybe like 45 minutes and

447
00:27:31.351 --> 00:27:36.210
he's just few sex. You go, going back, go,

448
00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:41.220
you come back because logically for a big guy, you're slow.

449
00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:45.270
When something is big and heavy, it's slow. And that's where we try to do,

450
00:27:45.271 --> 00:27:49.370
we tried to be as fast as possible for a big guy. So a lot of [inaudible]

451
00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:52.720
<v 2>plyometric type stuff. Yeah. Explosive type stuff. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

452
00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:57.310
Wade letters and stuff like that. Okay. Yeah. So when you do this kind of stuff,

453
00:27:57.311 --> 00:28:01.120
when you were saying that you lift low reps and then high reps,

454
00:28:01.330 --> 00:28:06.000
so you'd do like heavy weights first to try to like Max out or get the,

455
00:28:06.001 --> 00:28:09.760
the muscles very tired and then really where I'm out with with Reps.

456
00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:13.360
So we do have but we never go Max Max, so. Right, right, right.

457
00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:15.130
Then that like over Max what we,

458
00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:18.160
so you don't deal go to failure with like heavy heavyweights. Yeah.

459
00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:21.120
What kind of stuff are you doing? Are you doing like dumbbells, kettlebells,

460
00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:24.480
<v 1>a lot of a lot of numbers. Yeah. As minor,</v>

461
00:28:24.481 --> 00:28:26.580
as much loose weight as possible,

462
00:28:26.581 --> 00:28:30.540
like a few a with the barbel but as much with the,

463
00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:33.840
with the dumbbells because that's when you got to keep him balanced and work on

464
00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:35.130
the core and stuff like that.

465
00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:38.570
<v 2>So what about a sparring home? How often do you spar week?</v>

466
00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:42.440
<v 1>Uh, normally like twice to three times a week.</v>

467
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.030
<v 2>And when you do, what are you doing? Hard spot. I know you're from Holland,</v>

468
00:28:46.031 --> 00:28:48.670
those fucking Holland guys like the spar hard man.

469
00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:52.270
Do you do a lot of hearts sparrings that more technical? Like how do you,

470
00:28:52.271 --> 00:28:53.140
how do you balance it out?

471
00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:57.340
<v 1>Um, it depends, depends on who's who's in.</v>

472
00:28:57.730 --> 00:29:02.530
Because now in preparation we're going to fly guys in and then yeah,

473
00:29:02.531 --> 00:29:05.890
it's going to be pretty tough sparring. Cause that's what you, yeah,

474
00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:07.950
what you got, what'd you get the guys for? Right.

475
00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:12.700
But in the end I'm always thinking about, hey, we do heart sparring,

476
00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:14.830
but we don't want to injure each other. Right.

477
00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:19.980
There's no point for me in knocking guys out Jewing sparring because then I

478
00:29:21.221 --> 00:29:25.150
don't have any supplier partners anymore. Right. So I do hard sparring,

479
00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:28.090
kicked him hard on the legs, kick them hard on the body.

480
00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:33.220
And of course people get knocked, knocked down, not knocked out, but,

481
00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:33.830
right.

482
00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:38.270
<v 2>But you don't go full blast of the head. No, that's a Holland thing, right?</v>

483
00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:39.133
I mean there's a lot of [inaudible]

484
00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:44.320
<v 1>you guys do it. Yeah. Like that. But yeah, we'd go, we go pretty tough.</v>

485
00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:48.430
We go pretty tough to the, to the head, black eyes, bloody nose.

486
00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:53.460
But I'm always like 90% [inaudible] I'm always looking at like,

487
00:29:54.821 --> 00:29:58.590
hey, or when I'm making a move and I can make a head kick.

488
00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:02.620
I always try to, when I see I'm going to make a full hit,

489
00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:06.910
tries to keep it back just a little bit. So I think yeah,

490
00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:09.670
but just being controlled, I think it's very important.

491
00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:11.290
So I train with all the guys,

492
00:30:11.291 --> 00:30:14.530
all the heavyweight guys from glory I trained with with,

493
00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:19.010
and of course you do hard sparring, but we do not add,

494
00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:22.930
from my point of view, I don't don't want to injured them. Right. Yeah.

495
00:30:22.931 --> 00:30:26.200
I mean it only makes sense. I mean that's one of the most valuable things,

496
00:30:26.201 --> 00:30:28.330
right? It's to have high level training partners. Exactly.

497
00:30:28.331 --> 00:30:30.970
And if you guys think you're going to put them to sleep all the time,

498
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.770
they're not really interested in spa. For example,

499
00:30:32.771 --> 00:30:36.640
I train with Benny Attic buoy is like the number two or number three in glory.

500
00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:41.590
And I fought him twice, but we train together.

501
00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:46.180
He's now at my gym and I try to make him better say, hey,

502
00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:50.710
try this, try that. And because of his better, your better. Exactly.

503
00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:52.030
And people are like, no, no, no,

504
00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:54.970
I don't want to train with competition because then they know what I'm going to

505
00:30:54.971 --> 00:30:58.660
do. That's true. But you also know what they're doing.

506
00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:01.510
So it just depends on how you approach things.

507
00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:05.920
Every negative thing has a positive thing, edit as well. So that's,

508
00:31:06.010 --> 00:31:06.850
I really always,

509
00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:11.350
I'm always looking at the positive things and always try to surround myself with

510
00:31:12.010 --> 00:31:15.430
people that are positive. And yeah, that's,

511
00:31:15.431 --> 00:31:18.910
that's the vibe that I'm going with because that's what works well.

512
00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:22.660
That's also the mark of a confident fighter. Like you know that you're the best,

513
00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:23.920
so if you help him,

514
00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:26.740
he's just going to help you become even better than you are currently. Yeah.

515
00:31:26.741 --> 00:31:27.580
But you gotta be,

516
00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:32.950
you gotta be comfortable with that because you also see a lot of guys that like,

517
00:31:33.010 --> 00:31:35.110
no, I'm not gonna do that. I'm not going to do this.

518
00:31:35.111 --> 00:31:36.020
I'm not going to help the guy,

519
00:31:36.170 --> 00:31:38.890
not going to tell him whatever because this is not going to be good for me.

520
00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:40.510
But in the end,

521
00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:44.710
everybody that gets better can help me get better as well.

522
00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:49.930
So I always position myself as, as a sponge,

523
00:31:50.050 --> 00:31:54.670
I tried to get this much info in, in wherever I am.

524
00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:59.020
So for example, I'm now really going into acting. I want to, I want to act.

525
00:31:59.021 --> 00:32:03.180
So now Kevin was on your show as well. Kevin Hart. Yeah.

526
00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:05.470
So you're training with them. Yeah. So it was a lot of fun.

527
00:32:05.471 --> 00:32:09.070
The first kick he ever threw, he threw with you. Yeah. So what was crazy?

528
00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:11.260
He's a great guy. He is such a good guy,

529
00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:16.470
but so s so much positivity and he has such a great five and he's such a great

530
00:32:20.141 --> 00:32:24.010
mentor. And I was just sitting there, we were talking and like I said,

531
00:32:24.011 --> 00:32:25.930
I was just positioning myself as a sponge.

532
00:32:25.931 --> 00:32:30.850
I was just trying to get as much information in there as possible. And Yeah,

533
00:32:30.851 --> 00:32:34.900
now I've been, I'm here now in La for about a month now.

534
00:32:34.901 --> 00:32:38.410
I've been training with, with Mark Walberg and also the same thing,

535
00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:39.470
just Anthony hard donk.

536
00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:43.430
<v 0>Donk is here. It's amazing because when you're in La,</v>

537
00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:46.970
you want to do Dutch kickboxing. That's the place where you got to go. Yeah.

538
00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:50.510
Hard docs. Awesome. I love that guy. Yeah, he's amazing. So, uh,

539
00:32:50.511 --> 00:32:53.710
so every time I went in my lane, I'm going to tell people where to go. Dynamics,

540
00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:57.080
dynamics, dynamics [inaudible], which is in Santa Monica.

541
00:32:57.300 --> 00:33:00.740
And he just said they're opening up another one that he's going to run in west

542
00:33:00.741 --> 00:33:04.460
La. But he's, he's just, he was, when he used to fight in the UFC,

543
00:33:04.461 --> 00:33:07.160
I used to love watching him fight because he was probably one of the best leg

544
00:33:07.161 --> 00:33:11.750
kickers ever in the heavyweight division. He would just fuck guys legs up,

545
00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:16.640
you know. So technical. Yeah. So, so much fun. So last Saturday we, uh,

546
00:33:16.641 --> 00:33:18.500
we started sparring a little bits. He said, yeah,

547
00:33:18.501 --> 00:33:20.990
I'm looking for a little bit of sparring. I said, okay. I said,

548
00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:25.730
he said I didn't do anything for 10 years, but I want to do it.

549
00:33:25.731 --> 00:33:29.300
Just want to help you out. It is good. But I just wanna move around, you know,

550
00:33:29.301 --> 00:33:31.820
I don't, don't want to kick nobody's ass. I just want to move around.

551
00:33:31.821 --> 00:33:35.390
So that's what we did. We had a lot of fun. So, and then you still see,

552
00:33:35.391 --> 00:33:40.370
has that feeling, has that duct kickboxing touch? So it's, it's amazing. Yeah.

553
00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:44.630
No, there's not a lot of like real high level Dutch kickbox and you can get in

554
00:33:44.631 --> 00:33:46.850
California, especially out here. No, no, no.

555
00:33:46.851 --> 00:33:50.120
And he's definitely the guy and girl, but just heavy weights. It's difficult.

556
00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:54.110
Heavyweights barring is hard. Yeah. Good luck. Lively weight sparring.

557
00:33:54.111 --> 00:33:56.330
So yeah, we just keep,

558
00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:59.870
keep going around and that's why I love being here. So actually have,

559
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:04.950
I'm here for vacation, but when I'm here I gotta work as well. So, right.

560
00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:08.320
So the fight is in December, you were saying it's going to be in when?

561
00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:12.890
December the 21st uh, okay. So right before Christmas. My Christmas. Yeah.

562
00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:16.760
So that's what I said. Yeah. Maybe we'll do it in January as fuck.

563
00:34:16.761 --> 00:34:19.220
I wish it was [inaudible] I wish it was in America.

564
00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:23.460
I would love to see that shit. Well, I don't want to go to Holland. Physi

565
00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:28.870
[inaudible] I didn't want to go to the islands and they don't love Holland.

566
00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:33.500
You let it go busy. You got to come to Harlem and that's a lot of fun. I'm sure.

567
00:34:34.410 --> 00:34:36.950
I'm sure it's a bit, but if it was in like Chicago or some shit,

568
00:34:36.951 --> 00:34:40.490
I'd fly out Holland. That's a fucking, that's a long, that's a lot of flying.

569
00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:43.830
Yeah. It's like time, 11 hours, 11 hours on a plan.

570
00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:49.040
[inaudible] stay for couple of days. I don't have a week to spare. No. I wish

571
00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:53.000
that you busy, man. So you're out here trying to act too.

572
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:56.990
That's where you going to try to do getting an agent and meeting with people and

573
00:34:56.991 --> 00:35:00.950
stuff like that. Yeah, yeah, exactly. So, um, I'm uh, with, with paradigm,

574
00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:04.250
it's mine, uh, my American management now you taking,

575
00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:06.700
you obviously speak fluent English. Yeah.

576
00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:10.490
But are you taking lessons to get better at it so you can act and all that jazz?

577
00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:13.380
So that's your next goal. Exactly. So, um,

578
00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:15.860
I'm still an active athlete,

579
00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:19.250
but I'm still looking at like, hey,

580
00:35:19.251 --> 00:35:24.251
what can I do next because I can't and I don't want to do this for like 10 more

581
00:35:24.801 --> 00:35:27.470
years. When do you want to retire? Do you have a thought in your head?

582
00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:31.750
I don't know. It depends on where are right now. You're in your prime. Yeah.

583
00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:35.810
So it depends on what comes on my, my roots.

584
00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:39.870
So I still looking at, so now I'm in negotiations with Laurie.

585
00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:43.480
How is Gloria doing as an organization? Are they doing well yet? A noon.

586
00:35:43.770 --> 00:35:44.211
Cause I know they were,

587
00:35:44.211 --> 00:35:46.800
they were struggling a little bit in America and they were trying to dep,

588
00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:51.660
but do they still have events here in America? Yeah, less but less.

589
00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:55.230
Less than in the beginning because Europe is so much more successful.

590
00:35:55.231 --> 00:36:00.231
So dare we fill up like arenas or here we can get like five.

591
00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:05.730
But I went to the last man standing in La when, uh, Joe Schilling was there.

592
00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:08.280
Holy Shit. Was that crazy? Yeah, that was awesome.

593
00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:12.300
But I always tell people like you want to see real high level striking,

594
00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:14.160
you see high level striking in MMA.

595
00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:19.110
But with MMA there's all the other variables. Just take downs and small gloves,

596
00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:22.500
the whole deal. Like to really want to see high level kickboxing. Yeah,

597
00:36:22.810 --> 00:36:24.360
glory is where it's at. Exactly.

598
00:36:24.610 --> 00:36:28.960
<v 1>So that's for me now where I'm at is like I'm still in negotiation with Gloria</v>

599
00:36:28.961 --> 00:36:32.650
for new contracts and if we,

600
00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:36.370
in what way or the other we can get out of it.

601
00:36:36.371 --> 00:36:39.970
So maybe I'm going to do something else or I don't know. I'm,

602
00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:44.500
I'm looking at the sport like a totally different way. I don't want to,

603
00:36:44.770 --> 00:36:48.350
I think the sport can totally be elevated in,

604
00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:51.550
in all certain ways, you know, all different ways.

605
00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:55.720
Because how crazy would it be to do mixed fights?

606
00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:59.830
It's fun to go from one guy, go to the other sport,

607
00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:03.880
but how cool would it be that the other guy would go to the other sport as well?

608
00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:04.560
So someone

609
00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:08.040
<v 0>from MMA coming to kickboxing and the other way around. Yeah.</v>

610
00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:09.900
Well the other way around Sikh,

611
00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:13.920
I mean I I could see like Francis in Ghana, no,

612
00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:17.730
I think he would do really well in kickbox cause he's such a fucking

613
00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:20.910
ridiculously powerful striker. Yeah, he would do really well,

614
00:37:20.911 --> 00:37:22.530
but I don't think there's a lot of other, well,

615
00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:27.450
I mean obviously Alster if Allister really dedicated himself to it,

616
00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:32.010
but he's chasing the goal of being the UFC heavyweight champion. Yeah. Yeah.

617
00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:32.580
I mean who else?

618
00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:37.580
I mean the only other organization is one and one has,

619
00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:40.110
uh, they their do kickboxing as well.

620
00:37:40.111 --> 00:37:44.010
Now they do kickboxing and Muay Thai and they do Moitai tie with little gloves,

621
00:37:44.011 --> 00:37:45.830
which is kind of crazy. And that was pretty crazy.

622
00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:48.270
Have you thought about doing that? No, not really.

623
00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:51.920
<v 1>The gloves, that's crazy. Yeah. But I don't,</v>

624
00:37:51.921 --> 00:37:55.650
I don't mind when doing the small goals, but kickboxing is small gloves.

625
00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:57.900
It's pretty insane. How could the intense,

626
00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:03.390
because there's no way to block anything anymore.

627
00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:05.900
Right. Stand up and fight again.

628
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.540
Just put the gloves out and just do bare knuckle fight because it was almost the

629
00:38:09.541 --> 00:38:11.160
same. So, in

630
00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:15.630
<v 0>terms of like for people don't understand when you have big gloves on there's</v>

631
00:38:15.631 --> 00:38:17.700
more you can protect yourself. Exactly.

632
00:38:17.730 --> 00:38:22.670
You can shell up better and defensively. You Know Liam? Liam Harrison. Yeah.

633
00:38:22.830 --> 00:38:26.960
He fought in one with little gloves and boy tiny. He was like holy fuck.

634
00:38:26.961 --> 00:38:31.130
He sent me a masters like fucking brutal man. Like he's like,

635
00:38:31.131 --> 00:38:33.530
I can't believe how hard it is. It's so much different. Yeah,

636
00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:36.160
it's totally different. Yeah. She can do whatever.

637
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:40.060
<v 1>So yeah, that's, that's pretty insane. So I would like to say,</v>

638
00:38:40.350 --> 00:38:41.820
<v 2>I don't know why I was doing that. I mean,</v>

639
00:38:41.821 --> 00:38:45.260
cause I know they do have some matches where they wear big gloves just to,

640
00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:47.620
to push the limit of, yeah,

641
00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:49.980
well they have so many different kinds of matches over there.

642
00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:53.400
They even have grappling matches like straight, straight grappling. Yeah.

643
00:38:53.401 --> 00:38:57.490
I don't know that. Well, have you been to one at all? You bet they're gigantic.

644
00:38:57.790 --> 00:39:01.650
Yeah. Yeah. In Asia. Fucking huge man. There's no,

645
00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:05.430
but I've punched friends have gone over there to coach and even to fight.

646
00:39:05.431 --> 00:39:09.210
And you know, in a couple of people from the UFC, Meesha Tate, she's some,

647
00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:11.130
she has some executive position over there right now,

648
00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:14.190
which rich Franklin does as well. We used to be in the middle weight champion,

649
00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:16.560
you're saying? Yeah. So they, they, um,

650
00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:21.420
they have a bigger audience worldwide than the UFC does there humans in Asia

651
00:39:21.450 --> 00:39:24.690
check just gigantic and it keeps getting bigger and bigger.

652
00:39:24.691 --> 00:39:27.720
And they got really high level fighters too. So it's really interesting.

653
00:39:27.930 --> 00:39:29.700
But I know they're doing a lot of kickboxing as well.

654
00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:33.530
<v 1>Yeah. So who knows? Who knows more than better. Right.</v>

655
00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:36.050
More competition in the battle. Yeah, exactly. Exactly.

656
00:39:36.051 --> 00:39:40.130
Because that's what brings the whole sport up to another level. So that's,

657
00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:43.190
that's, that's perfect. And that's cool. But it's like I said, it's,

658
00:39:43.730 --> 00:39:48.710
I just like to do different stuff and now, like I said, I don't want to do,

659
00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:53.190
I don't want to fight for another 10 years, so let's see. What would, yeah,

660
00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:56.360
what's going to happen, you know, I'm gonna make a movie either way.

661
00:39:56.450 --> 00:39:59.420
So I'm going to start filming a movie in the beginning of next year.

662
00:39:59.870 --> 00:40:04.250
So that's a, that's pretty cool. It's the movie. Um, it's going to be,

663
00:40:04.251 --> 00:40:09.050
it's like totally, uh, from blank. We started it. So it's been,

664
00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:13.790
it's been written now. I got the first draft of the script and it's, it's crazy.

665
00:40:13.791 --> 00:40:16.610
He's telling me what you do. Uh, yeah. So I'm like a,

666
00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:20.080
like a black ops kind of guy. Uh,

667
00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:23.190
but something happens. You're an operation.

668
00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:26.240
I stopped cause I think this is what happened. It's crazy.

669
00:40:26.270 --> 00:40:29.360
I told them not to do this and it still,

670
00:40:29.390 --> 00:40:34.150
this happened so I'm going to stop and yeah, and then they bring you back.

671
00:40:34.490 --> 00:40:39.230
They, I, I got back, I said that case exactly. Exact people kick them. So, uh,

672
00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:43.230
people of course like of course, but I'm not that,

673
00:40:43.330 --> 00:40:46.700
that's the thing I said I don't want to be a fighter because people already know

674
00:40:46.701 --> 00:40:50.030
me from fighting. So I want to do something else. I want to really show my,

675
00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:52.580
my acting skills. So there's going to be,

676
00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:56.900
there's going to be so much fun and that's what I get my excitement from.

677
00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:58.820
Cause I love doing new songs, doing kickboxing.

678
00:40:58.930 --> 00:41:01.520
So I was six years old and then this like forever.

679
00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:05.870
So I want to do something else as well so that this is going to be a lot of fun.

680
00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:06.610
It's a harder

681
00:41:06.610 --> 00:41:09.520
<v 2>transition. The not a lot of people have been successful at it.</v>

682
00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:12.820
Like Randy couture is probably the most successful yet. You know, he's,

683
00:41:12.821 --> 00:41:16.710
he's got a real career as an actor now. He acts a bunch of movies, man.

684
00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:19.510
He said obviously he's in the expendables and, but he's always worked.

685
00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:22.920
<v 1>Yeah. But a lot of in the end when you look at the history,</v>

686
00:41:22.921 --> 00:41:27.690
a lot of athletes did it. Yeah, sure. Not a lot were like really good.

687
00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:32.570
But then again we got like on the watch a n****r Xango for damn sure.

688
00:41:32.810 --> 00:41:37.550
Sure. It's possible. And I like the challenge. Is there,

689
00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:38.120
uh,

690
00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:42.230
ever a worry of being like one foot in one foot out with your fighting career?

691
00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:46.040
Like acting starts to take off, but you're still fighting?

692
00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:50.840
Is there a worry about not being 100% all in? No. No.

693
00:41:50.841 --> 00:41:52.940
Because then the thing we said,

694
00:41:52.941 --> 00:41:56.870
I also discussed this with my trainer cause he's really crushes with that.

695
00:41:56.910 --> 00:42:00.500
He's like, Hey, when we focus on making a movie,

696
00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:03.800
that's what we are going to feel gonna focus on and if you're going to have a

697
00:42:03.801 --> 00:42:06.110
fight, we're going to fully focus on that.

698
00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:11.470
So those side things or let's do this for a second and then we go back and I'm

699
00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:16.460
just going to focus on that because that's what does fighters in exactly.

700
00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:17.840
I mean you've seen it like that.

701
00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:21.200
That happened with Ronda Rousey's happened with other fighters where they just

702
00:42:21.201 --> 00:42:22.880
get too spread thin,

703
00:42:23.170 --> 00:42:25.680
they get spread too thin and they have too many different projects can work

704
00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:30.440
simultaneously. I still date people still say that about me now at this moment.

705
00:42:30.441 --> 00:42:35.240
Like Rico's not focused, he doesn't say hey, but I trained every day.

706
00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:38.380
I'm focused in what I'm doing. I'm focused and kickboxing,

707
00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:43.100
but I just like the acting part and I just want to gain my knowledge and

708
00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:49.100
get better at it. So you got to train it the same escape boxing.

709
00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:53.810
Yeah. It's just gotta stay focused. Do you, do you ever do any Jujitsu? Uh,

710
00:42:53.811 --> 00:42:57.560
I did some, yeah, I did some. Yeah, I like it. I like it. It's a lot of fun.

711
00:42:57.590 --> 00:43:02.540
But now the last two years had been so busy, uh,

712
00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:06.350
with kickboxing and everything that happens on the side and just no time.

713
00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:11.740
So you don't have any real designs of eventually transferring to MMA?

714
00:43:12.830 --> 00:43:17.240
You know, like I said, for me, um, when I look at it, it was,

715
00:43:17.250 --> 00:43:21.360
people ask me, ask me this a lot, like, Rico would you,

716
00:43:21.450 --> 00:43:25.800
why don't you go to MMA? Yeah, yeah. It could be, it could be possible,

717
00:43:25.801 --> 00:43:29.700
but like from, if I look at it, honestly,

718
00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:33.390
it's not my basic, uh,

719
00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:36.810
ambition to go there because my ambition, my next ambition,

720
00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:40.830
cause when I look at it, it's like if you jump into something different,

721
00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:46.700
you should have the will and want to be the best and,

722
00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:52.260
and don't necessarily have the will to be the best at MMA,

723
00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:57.080
but if you get a crazy offer,

724
00:43:57.320 --> 00:44:00.440
that's what I was going to say. Someone comes along with the real shackles.

725
00:44:00.530 --> 00:44:05.040
You can buy some stuff. [inaudible] come on. Gotta look.

726
00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:10.370
Okay. Okay. Keep it going just a little bit more. Let's go.

727
00:44:10.371 --> 00:44:14.020
I got this. I'm motivated now so that,

728
00:44:14.570 --> 00:44:18.440
that's exactly what, uh, yeah, but if you decide to do that,

729
00:44:18.441 --> 00:44:22.640
how much time do you think you would legitimately need for like a real high

730
00:44:22.641 --> 00:44:27.200
level opponent to work a year? Take down a year? Yeah. Take down.

731
00:44:27.410 --> 00:44:31.830
Because I know what to do. I've, I've trained this for like two, three years,

732
00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:34.920
so I know, uh,

733
00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:39.360
but my body just needs to work on it. Have them ever fight in between, uh,

734
00:44:39.570 --> 00:44:43.050
maybe another fight and then I'm going to be able to do a high level fight.

735
00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:46.190
Or do you do any other kind of cardio? Do you run or of course, yeah.

736
00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:49.910
Do you hate it? Hate it. But you have to do it. Yeah.

737
00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:52.410
<v 2>Well it's, it's also for a big guy,</v>

738
00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:54.450
it's more of a pain in the ass to like what do you,

739
00:44:54.451 --> 00:44:56.370
what do you weigh about two 50, somewhere around there.

740
00:44:57.010 --> 00:45:00.710
<v 1>Uh, two 60, two 60. So that's when you're running. That's a lot of weight.</v>

741
00:45:00.950 --> 00:45:01.960
As a lot of weight on your joints.

742
00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:06.410
Cause of the the pressure and so but in the end,

743
00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:09.580
how much I did this, the,

744
00:45:10.290 --> 00:45:15.290
it works for me because it's also for me a mental training because I hate it so

745
00:45:16.311 --> 00:45:21.311
much and I jump on a treadmill or I go outside and I just want grown [inaudible]

746
00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:26.200
you gotta keep going, you gotta keep going because when you get,

747
00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:31.230
you have that feeling like 90% of the people would stop

748
00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:37.240
but you are not that person. You got to keep going and that's what,

749
00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:41.720
that's what motivates me just to do things different than everybody else.

750
00:45:41.721 --> 00:45:45.500
Does being comfortable being uncomfortable. Yes, exactly. The grind,

751
00:45:45.650 --> 00:45:49.550
the grind is, I think that's the moment when it, when it starts,

752
00:45:49.551 --> 00:45:52.160
when you get that feeling shit is going to hurt,

753
00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:57.220
your body starts hurting and that's when like a lot of people give up and that's

754
00:45:57.921 --> 00:46:00.170
where we as champions, we continue.

755
00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:02.520
<v 2>It's interesting too because a lot of fighters,</v>

756
00:46:02.550 --> 00:46:06.720
they'll do all sorts of high intensity training and interval training and all

757
00:46:06.721 --> 00:46:10.470
these different plyometrics and cardio and and different things.

758
00:46:10.471 --> 00:46:15.300
But many of them will tell you that one of the more important things is just

759
00:46:15.301 --> 00:46:19.400
long range running because when you do this long distance running where you're

760
00:46:19.410 --> 00:46:22.320
on five, six, seven miles, when you do that,

761
00:46:22.350 --> 00:46:27.350
you develop this cardio base where you can just keep working and you recover

762
00:46:27.781 --> 00:46:29.800
faster. And it's just, I mean this,

763
00:46:29.850 --> 00:46:33.300
one of the things that if you go back and look at old time fighters, you know,

764
00:46:33.301 --> 00:46:35.850
back to Muhammad Ali, sugar ray Robinson, all those guys,

765
00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:40.080
everybody ran rocky Marciano. Everybody ran. Yeah. There wasn't an option.

766
00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:43.620
It wasn't like you don't have to run. We can do a bunch of other things like no,

767
00:46:43.621 --> 00:46:44.820
no fighters run.

768
00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:47.440
<v 1>Yeah, that's what we do. Yeah, but it's just,</v>

769
00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:50.740
I always feel like running is not,

770
00:46:50.830 --> 00:46:55.780
the m is not the base of your, it's not most important,

771
00:46:55.781 --> 00:46:59.760
but it's like really important factor of the total package. Right?

772
00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:02.890
So it's just your yet the,

773
00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:07.360
the oxygen you have like for keeping the same pace for a longer,

774
00:47:07.450 --> 00:47:08.440
a longer time.

775
00:47:08.950 --> 00:47:13.210
Then of course the explosiveness that we use during a fight is important.

776
00:47:13.211 --> 00:47:16.390
But also just, yeah, the, the,

777
00:47:16.391 --> 00:47:20.020
your basic lung capacity should be, should be big as well.

778
00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:24.880
What about heavy bag work? Yeah, we do it but not that much.

779
00:47:24.910 --> 00:47:28.540
Nothing like once a week. Some more pad work.

780
00:47:28.541 --> 00:47:29.950
More things.

781
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:31.870
<v 0>Yeah. Not like, cause I see some guy,</v>

782
00:47:31.930 --> 00:47:35.320
it's really interesting how different camps, different fighters,

783
00:47:35.321 --> 00:47:40.300
different trainers prefer different preparation methods and some swear by

784
00:47:40.301 --> 00:47:44.410
intervals in the heavy, heavy bag. Some swear by doing rounds on the heavy bag,

785
00:47:45.070 --> 00:47:47.400
you know, and some, some don't think it's that critical. Yeah.

786
00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:48.760
I think for everybody's different. Yeah.

787
00:47:48.810 --> 00:47:50.310
<v 1>But like for me,</v>

788
00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:55.110
throughout all those years I've been trying different stuff and I think now I

789
00:47:55.111 --> 00:48:00.111
created the right combination of different trainings,

790
00:48:00.350 --> 00:48:01.890
just polishing everything.

791
00:48:02.310 --> 00:48:07.050
And I think I found the right way to get fit because I don't need to get,

792
00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:10.530
I need to get better. I always, I'm always looking to get better.

793
00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:13.530
But you get better by putting in the work.

794
00:48:13.950 --> 00:48:18.180
But I'm always looking at how can I change my training up?

795
00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:23.660
What would be an add on what in what I already have? Right?

796
00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:28.020
So now I think I created the right combination but,

797
00:48:28.021 --> 00:48:30.660
and still I'm looking to add stuff on,

798
00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:35.430
but I think I created the right way to get fit for a fight.

799
00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:40.470
Cause I've shown that throughout all those years I've shown that I'm fitter than

800
00:48:41.130 --> 00:48:43.710
all the rest. And that's,

801
00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:48.740
that's a part but a still I think the biggest differences that everybody is

802
00:48:51.481 --> 00:48:54.420
strong and everybody's fit. Everybody can fight.

803
00:48:55.410 --> 00:49:00.410
But the biggest difference is mentally what happens to you mentally when you get

804
00:49:01.231 --> 00:49:04.920
to the fourth and fifth round thing. That's the most important thing.

805
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:10.140
How strong are you mentally to continue fighting?

806
00:49:11.550 --> 00:49:16.550
A lot of people when you feel like always for the people that do not understand

807
00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:19.590
what this, what this fighting game is,

808
00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:22.740
what happens to you when you're in the ring or in an octagon?

809
00:49:23.550 --> 00:49:27.060
So you can always compare it with driving a car.

810
00:49:27.690 --> 00:49:32.690
You driving a car and the last one is 40 50 miles.

811
00:49:34.590 --> 00:49:38.790
The guests, light comes on, hey, you got to get gas.

812
00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:44.780
That's the same thing that happens to your body when you get tired as science,

813
00:49:45.570 --> 00:49:49.350
whatever happens in your mind or your head, hey, you're tired.

814
00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:51.330
When you're tired, you need to rest.

815
00:49:52.530 --> 00:49:55.500
And we as athletes,

816
00:49:55.530 --> 00:50:00.150
we do not listen to that light that goes off in your car.

817
00:50:00.450 --> 00:50:01.050
And even, yeah,

818
00:50:01.050 --> 00:50:05.940
<v 0>I call, I don't listen. I always go, I had a few times that was undecided,</v>

819
00:50:05.941 --> 00:50:09.780
the road without gas. So I'm sorry, but she said,

820
00:50:09.781 --> 00:50:12.990
psychological dude do that because you think of your car like a body.

821
00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:20.370
Like you chat to fuck you car. Don't be a pussy. Hey Joe, thank you.

822
00:50:20.371 --> 00:50:24.730
I appreciate that. But yeah, I think that is what it is. You know,

823
00:50:25.290 --> 00:50:27.960
it's like the same game you're playing, play that game to your car.

824
00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:31.640
<v 1>It's so stupid.</v>

825
00:50:31.641 --> 00:50:36.020
But for me it works because I always push my car to the limit.

826
00:50:36.350 --> 00:50:38.840
That's why I did what I do to myself as well, you know?

827
00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:43.820
And that's what I luckily have a great team, uh, people around me for,

828
00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:49.030
because even when everything is hurting and tired and I almost get over-trained,

829
00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:54.020
my people have to pull me back. Say Rico,

830
00:50:54.230 --> 00:50:58.130
just no point in training now because you're going to get over-trained and

831
00:50:58.131 --> 00:51:01.700
you're going to fuck yourself up. Right? So it's that fine balance, right?

832
00:51:01.701 --> 00:51:05.300
It's hard to figure out. I don't, I have to balance. I don't have it.

833
00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:09.230
I tried to have it and every time in, in preparation,

834
00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:13.140
I think I got it now I got it. I don't got it. No.

835
00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:14.810
So you need other people around you.

836
00:51:14.850 --> 00:51:17.370
The people that objective that can tell you like, Hey Rico,

837
00:51:17.630 --> 00:51:22.280
you gotta you gotta step back. Because for me, in my mind, I dunno what it is,

838
00:51:22.281 --> 00:51:25.130
but we're not, when I'm not working,

839
00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:31.010
I'm standing still or going down. That's what happens in my mind.

840
00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:34.570
So I gotta keep working and gotta keep grinding. Right?

841
00:51:34.580 --> 00:51:36.920
But that's also because of your style,

842
00:51:37.010 --> 00:51:40.850
because of the fact that you do push such a tremendous pace that you're,

843
00:51:40.851 --> 00:51:43.730
you're constantly feel like you have to have your foot on the gas. Yeah. Right.

844
00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:47.200
That's interesting. So you've been with the same coach for a long time? Yeah,

845
00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:52.070
like since I was like 17 oh, so that's great.

846
00:51:52.071 --> 00:51:56.630
So they know you the key when I come in,

847
00:51:56.631 --> 00:51:59.450
so know what's going on. So critical. Right. And that the whole team,

848
00:51:59.510 --> 00:52:03.290
so my power coach. Oh, okay. So the same, same team the entire time.

849
00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:07.820
Can you imagine like, like in the beginning of when we were working,

850
00:52:07.821 --> 00:52:09.890
like when we work in like for three,

851
00:52:09.891 --> 00:52:14.480
four years and then I come in Monday morning power training

852
00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:19.100
and my trainer walks up to me and looking at me, what the hell,

853
00:52:19.101 --> 00:52:22.700
what the hell do you do this weekend? What do you mean?

854
00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:26.910
What have you been eating? Yeah.

855
00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:30.030
Saturday night I went to the McDonald's. What's the problem?

856
00:52:31.230 --> 00:52:35.130
Look at your blown head man. See that like, yeah, you know,

857
00:52:35.131 --> 00:52:38.140
fat old stuff. The water in your, the flu.

858
00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:42.030
He could tell from one McDonald's meal. Really?

859
00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:43.700
That's how close we were.

860
00:52:44.210 --> 00:52:47.490
That's how like he sees me like multiple times a week.

861
00:52:47.670 --> 00:52:51.960
So he saw me like, like Fridays. So he just knows you just,

862
00:52:51.990 --> 00:52:56.280
he just knows everything. Did you monitor your heart rate or anything like that?

863
00:52:56.610 --> 00:53:00.630
Uh, yes. Every morning I, uh, I uh,

864
00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:04.460
checked my blood pressure and stuff like that. Uh, get my temperature. Do,

865
00:53:04.470 --> 00:53:07.640
do it with a computer. Do you have a program? [inaudible] no, no, no.

866
00:53:07.650 --> 00:53:11.370
Just write it down. Just write it down and then, uh, send it to the,

867
00:53:11.550 --> 00:53:13.080
to the doctor every now and then.

868
00:53:13.081 --> 00:53:15.980
So if your heart rate is a little bit too high in the morning,

869
00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:20.340
do you just do it like an active recovery day? Just relax. Yeah, we, uh,

870
00:53:20.430 --> 00:53:24.810
we now check it more through the temperature than through the heart rate.

871
00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:29.050
Really? Yeah. Temperature. Yeah. Interesting. So I,

872
00:53:29.051 --> 00:53:32.730
my temperature is up. I gotta Watch out.

873
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:36.660
So you might be fighting off a cold or something like that, something like that.

874
00:53:36.661 --> 00:53:39.960
Fighting off a cold or you still a,

875
00:53:39.961 --> 00:53:43.260
your body's still recovering from the last four gallon last trainings.

876
00:53:43.590 --> 00:53:46.140
So from that we can,

877
00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:50.670
so we haven't done it now for a few years and that's exactly when,

878
00:53:50.970 --> 00:53:55.170
when I feel like, hey my, my temperature goes up and it goes there,

879
00:53:56.010 --> 00:53:58.310
this doesn't feel good. And then every time when we,

880
00:53:58.530 --> 00:54:02.730
in the end we always look back at an analyze stuff and then my traits, hey,

881
00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:07.710
exactly there. Cause this training was shit. So you take,

882
00:54:07.830 --> 00:54:12.530
do you use this like do you make a log during your training,

883
00:54:12.580 --> 00:54:17.100
compare it to like your last camp and you look at the numbers and make sure that

884
00:54:17.101 --> 00:54:18.170
everything lines up. Yeah.

885
00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:21.570
So you kind of have to be right at this point in time if you want to really get

886
00:54:21.571 --> 00:54:24.150
everything dialed in and you kind of have to be scientific about everything,

887
00:54:24.151 --> 00:54:28.040
right? Yeah. Because there's so much more than just, uh,

888
00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:29.340
fighting and good training.

889
00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:34.740
It's like good nutrition and this and that and it's just everything has to be

890
00:54:34.741 --> 00:54:36.510
balanced out. I was going to ask you about that.

891
00:54:36.511 --> 00:54:41.430
Do you have a dietician or someone who cooks for you? Uh, yeah. So in, in,

892
00:54:41.740 --> 00:54:46.740
in, in camp. So in, uh, I, I think like two years ago,

893
00:54:46.741 --> 00:54:50.450
I started with that. Do you eat horse meat? No,

894
00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:51.960
it's not a big thing over there.

895
00:54:51.961 --> 00:54:56.961
Like Allister's is a big horse meat guy and I don't think it was a good excuse.

896
00:54:58.340 --> 00:55:01.620
<v 3>The things that he did next to mixed dividing. That's it.</v>

897
00:55:01.621 --> 00:55:06.120
Everybody said to everybody, I was like, yeah, Hornsby. Yeah. Hey,

898
00:55:06.121 --> 00:55:09.490
it works. Yeah. Look at the size of them. Gotta know what horse?

899
00:55:10.810 --> 00:55:15.270
<v 1>Yeah. So, no. So that's a no, I,</v>

900
00:55:15.550 --> 00:55:18.520
I've no clue. No Guy, but it's not like in my diet or something.

901
00:55:18.521 --> 00:55:22.490
Just what do you eat a lot? In a lot. Yeah.

902
00:55:22.540 --> 00:55:26.110
Multiple meals a day. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. For sure. So, uh, but that's,

903
00:55:26.170 --> 00:55:30.250
that's the fun people. Like how much do you eat? It's,

904
00:55:30.251 --> 00:55:34.780
it's crazy. It's, yeah, but I burn a lot as well, so I have to,

905
00:55:35.710 --> 00:55:36.850
and for me,

906
00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:40.870
doing the fun thing with that is that the fight industry thing,

907
00:55:40.930 --> 00:55:44.200
when I tell people, said when I get closer to the fight,

908
00:55:45.370 --> 00:55:48.400
I'm eating myself slim. So the more I'm eating,

909
00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:51.070
the slimmer I'm getting because I have training very hard.

910
00:55:51.220 --> 00:55:55.620
And your body's just in a burning process, right.

911
00:55:55.660 --> 00:55:58.060
When the food is gone, it's gonna start burning fat.

912
00:55:58.090 --> 00:56:02.080
So I get slimmer the closer I get to the fight, I said,

913
00:56:02.081 --> 00:56:04.510
but when you see what an aids, like how do you do that?

914
00:56:04.510 --> 00:56:08.090
But it's just all because this is truly training so much. Yeah. So what,

915
00:56:08.091 --> 00:56:10.270
what kind of foods do they prepare for you do they,

916
00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:15.190
did they have like those prepaid pre-prepared packets and you just heat them up

917
00:56:15.191 --> 00:56:18.310
or something like that? Like how does that work? Uh, yeah. Meal,

918
00:56:18.370 --> 00:56:22.440
like a meal prep company does. Yeah, no, it's just like a private cook. Okay.

919
00:56:22.750 --> 00:56:27.370
Yeah. Private [inaudible] runs with me and just make sure every day I get,

920
00:56:27.550 --> 00:56:30.310
and they check the macros and make sure that you get the same,

921
00:56:30.311 --> 00:56:33.070
the right amount of protein, the right amount of carbohydrates.

922
00:56:33.250 --> 00:56:34.300
So there's not like really,

923
00:56:34.301 --> 00:56:38.410
like it's everything is a put it on a scale or something like that.

924
00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:40.840
We don't do that because yeah,

925
00:56:41.060 --> 00:56:44.650
there's certain things I just want a little bit more or I still have,

926
00:56:45.370 --> 00:56:46.300
I'm still a little bit hungry.

927
00:56:46.301 --> 00:56:49.390
So it's not like you need to lose weight or anything. No. So,

928
00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:51.250
but still have in my mind,

929
00:56:51.251 --> 00:56:54.520
always a certain type of fight weight that I like to fight on.

930
00:56:54.670 --> 00:56:59.050
What does that weight like 118 and a half.

931
00:57:00.030 --> 00:57:01.060
118 half kilos. What is that?

932
00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:06.840
I think it's around two to four not two 85 at two 58 I think.

933
00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:11.830
Well, it's 2.2 pounds.

934
00:57:12.370 --> 00:57:16.960
2.2 kilos or 2.2 pounds per kilo when eighteens two 60 pounds to six ounces.

935
00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:19.630
That's right. Right on their home. Yeah. So, okay,

936
00:57:19.631 --> 00:57:22.610
then I'm lying then I'm now a little bit heavier.

937
00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:29.620
Guys. Come on. I'm in La. No, I got it. I went to in and out a few times.

938
00:57:29.710 --> 00:57:31.000
So how could you not,

939
00:57:31.380 --> 00:57:34.870
so it's gotta be around two do 65.

940
00:57:34.930 --> 00:57:38.440
Do you try to stay pretty healthy in terms of your diet though?

941
00:57:38.441 --> 00:57:42.430
Even when you're not in camp? Yeah. Yeah. So for me, because we go,

942
00:57:42.550 --> 00:57:47.050
how do you do it? Is it, for me fighting is a lifestyle. It's not. Um,

943
00:57:47.470 --> 00:57:50.590
it's not like when I go, when I wake up, Oh,

944
00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:55.270
this morning I go to the gym, think about the fight folks, focus, focus,

945
00:57:55.330 --> 00:57:59.680
go out the gym. And my focus is all I said, I wake up with it,

946
00:58:00.250 --> 00:58:02.830
I go to bed with it, and when I'm in bed, I'm dreaming about it.

947
00:58:04.060 --> 00:58:08.890
This is 24, seven. Every day I'm thinking about us. Every meal,

948
00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:13.240
every thing you do is just thinking about what's coming.

949
00:58:13.420 --> 00:58:17.080
That's why you're the champ. Yeah, I think so. I don't think too much,

950
00:58:17.140 --> 00:58:22.140
but for me it's like such a crazy thing that goes on in my mind because I

951
00:58:22.691 --> 00:58:26.530
trained twice a day and then at night when I'm at home, think like,

952
00:58:26.740 --> 00:58:29.470
you know what? I'm in front of television. My wife on the couch, I'm like,

953
00:58:29.940 --> 00:58:32.380
I want to do some stretching and just going to sit on the ground.

954
00:58:32.381 --> 00:58:37.330
Just stretch or do some more app work. It's just, I don't know.

955
00:58:37.650 --> 00:58:42.040
I think like I'm obsessed or of course you have to be obsessed. I mean,

956
00:58:42.041 --> 00:58:45.400
you're in the most, one of the most dangerous combat sports in the world.

957
00:58:45.670 --> 00:58:46.900
And you're the world champion.

958
00:58:47.830 --> 00:58:50.650
So it's constantly that pressure and they're just thinking, Hey,

959
00:58:50.651 --> 00:58:53.950
my opponent probably now is resting or whatever he's doing, I don't care,

960
00:58:54.070 --> 00:58:58.010
but I need to do some next row. So constantly that's that,

961
00:58:58.120 --> 00:59:01.090
that's running through my mind. Everything that I'm doing, he's not doing.

962
00:59:01.300 --> 00:59:04.660
Now do you take vitamins and supplements? What kinds of stuff do you take?

963
00:59:06.430 --> 00:59:11.260
Um, uh, it's really like, uh, like old natural stuff.

964
00:59:11.290 --> 00:59:13.840
And I go through the to the doctor. So, uh,

965
00:59:13.870 --> 00:59:18.870
he takes my blood and then from there on he always looks at how does it look?

966
00:59:19.150 --> 00:59:23.510
This is looking good. Maybe it needs some to wrap a role or whatever. Yeah. So,

967
00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:28.370
uh, so he, uh, he fills it up whenever, uh, whenever it's needed.

968
00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:32.900
And during the period I'm training, I just take the normal,

969
00:59:32.901 --> 00:59:37.850
the normal stuff, magnesium, iron or whatever, vitamin C, stuff like that,

970
00:59:37.851 --> 00:59:41.690
just to keep everything on the right level. And then once a month I go to him,

971
00:59:42.020 --> 00:59:46.370
or the closer we get to the fight, maybe go twice, a twice a month,

972
00:59:46.670 --> 00:59:49.760
and then you just check it like, okay, it's good. Or now, Oh,

973
00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:54.200
you got a lot of white blood cells, so you're getting close to being a,

974
00:59:54.201 --> 00:59:55.580
your muscles are tired, you know,

975
00:59:55.850 --> 01:00:00.020
he getting overtrained to look at that and maybe get some more protein,

976
01:00:00.021 --> 01:00:03.170
you know, and stuff like that. So that's how we try to do that.

977
01:00:03.171 --> 01:00:04.280
What else do you do for recovery?

978
01:00:04.281 --> 01:00:07.830
Do you do any cryotherapy or things along those lines? Yeah,

979
01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:09.530
so I've been stunning dad, like

980
01:00:11.110 --> 01:00:15.170
one and a half year ago or something and it works. I like it to do it. Um,

981
01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:18.260
do you do ice baths or like how do you, what do you do? No,

982
01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:22.970
I just do literally the Cryo [inaudible] the machines all solid.

983
01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:28.040
Frozen. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I did like, uh, two different, uh, in Holland.

984
01:00:28.041 --> 01:00:32.910
Now it's rec really starting to do, to be hype. So not to get like, uh,

985
01:00:32.990 --> 01:00:35.750
different, uh, places. Uh,

986
01:00:35.850 --> 01:00:39.060
<v 0>do you go on the one that is from the neck down or the one that gets your whole</v>

987
01:00:39.061 --> 01:00:42.390
body in there? Yeah, so first I started with, uh, with the one with the,

988
01:00:42.391 --> 01:00:45.550
with the neck. Now the whole body is a better one though. Yeah,

989
01:00:45.770 --> 01:00:49.260
this is the place out here. A cryotherapy. It's the fucking shit. I love it.

990
01:00:49.530 --> 01:00:52.830
It's 240 degrees below zero and just go in there for three minutes.

991
01:00:53.050 --> 01:00:57.150
You motherfucker fuck me. I'll get it there.

992
01:00:57.300 --> 01:01:00.280
Like a mental training ass. Come on. You got,

993
01:01:00.470 --> 01:01:04.710
<v 1>yeah. So, uh, so that's what I started with and then, but deal, uh,</v>

994
01:01:04.770 --> 01:01:08.130
I think the only one we have now is an Amsterdam,

995
01:01:08.250 --> 01:01:11.520
like the full body and like it was like two hours.

996
01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:16.530
Well from the known downs. Good enough. So now I'm gonna I got one,

997
01:01:16.710 --> 01:01:21.510
I got one named my own gym, so I'm just, I can jump in, in and out.

998
01:01:21.540 --> 01:01:22.373
Easy. Yeah.

999
01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:26.850
So just start with that and then from there I'm going to see ya gonna see how it

1000
01:01:26.851 --> 01:01:31.590
works, but about sauna. Uh, yeah, I use it, but not,

1001
01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:36.680
not too often. So good man. I know. It's so good for recovery. You know,

1002
01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:41.030
I, I like it for the full, the first

1003
01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:45.650
<v 0>two minutes and then afterwards I'm like, it's like, again,</v>

1004
01:01:45.651 --> 01:01:48.710
it's like metric training. I know, but I'm like, I have to,

1005
01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:53.300
my wife's like enjoying it. There's this other stuff like it's so nice

1006
01:01:58.130 --> 01:02:02.750
cause you're playing a game with yourself. You can't just enjoy it. Your,

1007
01:02:02.751 --> 01:02:06.110
your opponent would probably be get out now. You don't got to stay in, come on.

1008
01:02:06.130 --> 01:02:10.880
It's like really sweat, just dripping off. Like it's like really,

1009
01:02:10.881 --> 01:02:14.330
I was fucking myself up cause I was trying to crank it up too.

1010
01:02:14.331 --> 01:02:19.130
I had layered Hamilton on the podcast. He's a surfer, big time surfer and uh,

1011
01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:20.050
his wife, uh,

1012
01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:24.870
Gabriela Reese was telling me that he cranks his up to 220 degrees. So, uh,

1013
01:02:24.930 --> 01:02:29.190
I did that for a little bit. I got up to like two, 10 to 18,

1014
01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:34.080
but it was, I think it was burned in my lungs. I think I was cooking in there.

1015
01:02:34.081 --> 01:02:37.380
I really do. I would, I would feel like shit and then I would get out.

1016
01:02:37.381 --> 01:02:40.890
I'd be so fucking tired. I was like, I don't think this is good for you.

1017
01:02:41.830 --> 01:02:46.230
I dropped down. Now do normal now I do it like one 80, which is normal.

1018
01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:49.020
180 degrees Fahrenheit. Oh, that is Celsius.

1019
01:02:49.150 --> 01:02:50.930
<v 1>Yeah. I think like [inaudible]</v>

1020
01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:55.910
<v 0>80, 85. Yeah. But that's normal. That's like a normal hot sauna.</v>

1021
01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:59.090
Good enough. 20 minutes I'm in, I'm out. It's pretty hot.

1022
01:02:59.150 --> 01:03:03.500
It's pretty hot for me. It's hot man. But it's very good for you.

1023
01:03:03.501 --> 01:03:08.480
Those heat shock proteins and they did these studies that showed a 40% decrease

1024
01:03:08.481 --> 01:03:12.770
in mortality for all causes, heart attack, stroke, cancer,

1025
01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:16.280
40% decrease where people use the sauna for four times a week or more.

1026
01:03:16.370 --> 01:03:20.660
That was in, um, what was it? Sweden. Jamie. Do you remember Dr Rhonda? Patrick?

1027
01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:24.140
Yeah. She was talking about it. No, that's planning it. Yeah.

1028
01:03:24.141 --> 01:03:27.050
It's phenomenal for you because of heat shock proteins.

1029
01:03:27.051 --> 01:03:31.430
It makes your body reduces inflammation throughout your whole body as does

1030
01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:35.360
cryotherapy. Anything where you're dealing with extreme cold or extreme heat,

1031
01:03:35.361 --> 01:03:39.080
your body develops either heat shock proteins or cold shock protein.

1032
01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:43.930
<v 1>Yeah. So I also am, so there was this, this um,</v>

1033
01:03:43.990 --> 01:03:46.990
displays where, where I went, where I went for the Cryo and he said, oh,

1034
01:03:46.991 --> 01:03:50.490
we also got something else. I don't know what it's called. What is it called?

1035
01:03:51.070 --> 01:03:53.110
Can't remember. So you just get like,

1036
01:03:53.710 --> 01:03:57.700
like put in a cocoon or something and just go to sleep.

1037
01:03:58.650 --> 01:03:59.483
Oh yeah.

1038
01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:04.560
You're in water so you're like floating it so the water is like your foot.

1039
01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:07.120
Yeah. The void is all floating. It's called floating.

1040
01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:10.720
<v 0>I was like, what the hell? I'm Flo. Definitely the fuck it's called.</v>

1041
01:04:10.830 --> 01:04:15.010
You mean like a cry? Like a float tank? Like a [inaudible] here.

1042
01:04:15.070 --> 01:04:17.560
It looks like a coon. Oh, okay. I know what you're talking about.

1043
01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:21.930
They just close it and they put you in their sensory deprivation tank. Yeah.

1044
01:04:22.060 --> 01:04:25.660
For an hour. And you had one right here. Oh really? Yeah. It's awesome.

1045
01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:29.460
I'm going to sleep for an hour. It's a big one too.

1046
01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:34.750
It's huge. The one I have here is huge. Yeah. Why? Wow. You use a small, yeah,

1047
01:04:34.751 --> 01:04:35.880
but that's the best one they have.

1048
01:04:37.220 --> 01:04:39.520
I just wanted one that anyone can come in they,

1049
01:04:39.530 --> 01:04:42.220
so it's like seven feet long and nine feet high.

1050
01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:44.230
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. It's amazing. And they said,</v>

1051
01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:48.940
they said when you finally get to the point where you know how to

1052
01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:52.680
<v 0>was like mentally relax. It's the same as one.</v>

1053
01:04:52.681 --> 01:04:56.430
I was like four or five hours of sleep or something. Yes. Yeah, yeah.

1054
01:04:56.431 --> 01:04:59.610
You relaxed and it's also your body absorbed magnesium. Yeah,

1055
01:04:59.790 --> 01:05:02.950
because it's Epsom salts, so all the salt that's in the waters,

1056
01:05:02.970 --> 01:05:06.150
a thousand pounds of salt in the water, all that Epsom salts,

1057
01:05:06.151 --> 01:05:09.630
the magnesium gets through your skin into your bloodstream. So it's really good.

1058
01:05:09.820 --> 01:05:13.980
Like it's almost like take new mag weights as good or better take than taking a

1059
01:05:13.981 --> 01:05:16.710
magnesium supplement. Yeah. Really good for your muscles too.

1060
01:05:16.711 --> 01:05:18.480
Like everything gets loose and relax

1061
01:05:18.630 --> 01:05:21.910
<v 1>and it feels like everything's stretches out and, Yup. What about,</v>

1062
01:05:22.210 --> 01:05:24.000
I'm also tried that. Yeah. I'll show you.

1063
01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:26.350
I'll show you too when you get out of here. What about a massage?

1064
01:05:26.351 --> 01:05:29.800
Do you get massage? Yeah, like daily. Daily? Yeah.

1065
01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:36.490
Physiotherapist a comes in to the house and just keeps it,

1066
01:05:36.550 --> 01:05:39.550
keeps the blood flowing nice. Just make sure, yeah.

1067
01:05:39.551 --> 01:05:42.790
Everything that just full recovery. But also, um,

1068
01:05:43.730 --> 01:05:46.900
also just for the injuries, just keep checking like, oh, what's this?

1069
01:05:46.901 --> 01:05:51.700
What's that? What's hurting? And so luckily, uh, I've been doing pretty good.

1070
01:05:51.970 --> 01:05:55.150
Not Too many injuries. Yeah. Having a good one, a good massage.

1071
01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:58.540
Therapists that deal with injuries is just started Ganter. Yeah. Right. Yeah.

1072
01:05:58.541 --> 01:06:03.100
It's so important. So they can prevent things, fix things,

1073
01:06:03.430 --> 01:06:04.900
things that are starting to go south.

1074
01:06:04.930 --> 01:06:08.650
They can stop it in its tracks and make me loosen everything up.

1075
01:06:08.651 --> 01:06:10.550
And cause sometimes when you get an injury, right,

1076
01:06:10.580 --> 01:06:14.110
everything around it tightens up and then when you're training it gets even more

1077
01:06:14.111 --> 01:06:16.060
fucked up. But if someone can loosen that up,

1078
01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:18.820
then it has time to relax and feel. Yeah.

1079
01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:22.590
Or else it just getting more tense and then you're going to rip something,

1080
01:06:22.830 --> 01:06:25.040
something, whatever. So yeah, that's so important.

1081
01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:30.120
And I think that's one of the key factors in being a pro athlete.

1082
01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:36.700
There's the people you have around you and the team that helps you balance

1083
01:06:36.701 --> 01:06:40.050
everything out and they say, hey guys, we go yet you want to fight him? Say,

1084
01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:41.770
yeah, I'm Rico to fight.

1085
01:06:41.771 --> 01:06:46.771
I'm Rico the champion because of all those people that are the team that are

1086
01:06:47.291 --> 01:06:50.290
around me. So still in the end you're doing an individual sport,

1087
01:06:50.950 --> 01:06:55.690
but you have a great team around you to be that person that you are in the ring.

1088
01:06:55.750 --> 01:06:58.030
And at the highest level, I think you have to have that.

1089
01:06:58.031 --> 01:07:00.460
You have to have all the ducks in line, right?

1090
01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:03.310
You have to have everything in line if you want to be at the very top of the

1091
01:07:03.311 --> 01:07:07.730
heap. Yeah, you have to. What about a psychology? Do you have a,

1092
01:07:07.731 --> 01:07:11.170
a mental trainer or anybody who's like a sports psychologist?

1093
01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:14.090
Well that's the fun thing. I started off with, um,

1094
01:07:15.070 --> 01:07:17.290
the guy I was telling you about, all of your Lima,

1095
01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:22.000
he's a also kickboxing wheel champion and different different weight divisions.

1096
01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:27.460
And I was training with him and he took me with his training,

1097
01:07:27.810 --> 01:07:32.810
took me to his training and I was working with him in his prime and without him

1098
01:07:33.911 --> 01:07:38.440
knowing, he was teaching me so much about mental training because

1099
01:07:40.270 --> 01:07:44.530
I was training with him and he was never giving up and the moment,

1100
01:07:44.670 --> 01:07:49.660
and I just showed something like he gave even extra,

1101
01:07:49.750 --> 01:07:50.501
even more gas.

1102
01:07:50.501 --> 01:07:55.240
So when you started slowing down and it was even pushing the pace even more.

1103
01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:59.050
And that's what I was seeing in his fights and I was just studying him.

1104
01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:03.560
And from that I learned so much and I respect him.

1105
01:08:03.570 --> 01:08:06.640
I still so much so thankful for that. So, and then he's still my,

1106
01:08:06.641 --> 01:08:10.150
my mental coach with that so easily my corner.

1107
01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:13.660
And every time when he says something, I just think about,

1108
01:08:13.670 --> 01:08:16.900
I don't want to disappoint this man because he knows what,

1109
01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:21.740
how important this is. And I think it's from the style last year or something,

1110
01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:27.430
I was really like a little bit skeptical about talking to people,

1111
01:08:28.581 --> 01:08:32.310
like, like a psychologist or something. I was like, I don't know. Oh,

1112
01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:36.170
let's talk about personal stuff, you know?

1113
01:08:36.250 --> 01:08:40.520
And it's pretty deep with somebody you don't know is, I don't know,

1114
01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:44.960
this maybe in my mind just doesn't add up, you know? Does it feel good?

1115
01:08:46.070 --> 01:08:50.360
Uh, but still I got in the situation that had to, or, yeah,

1116
01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:51.890
I just, I just had to,

1117
01:08:51.891 --> 01:08:55.640
and I went there and it actually felt pretty good.

1118
01:08:55.970 --> 01:09:00.800
So from that moment I just kept on doing it. Just talk about,

1119
01:09:00.980 --> 01:09:05.300
just talk about stuff I know you like, like no other,

1120
01:09:05.780 --> 01:09:06.830
no what,

1121
01:09:06.860 --> 01:09:11.860
how many things happened of what everything that happens in your life and you

1122
01:09:12.201 --> 01:09:15.380
just gotta process all that stuff. But sometimes she just,

1123
01:09:16.250 --> 01:09:20.270
so many things happen in your life that you just can't process and you put them

1124
01:09:20.271 --> 01:09:24.560
away and they're fucking with you in the back of your head. Exactly. Exactly.

1125
01:09:24.561 --> 01:09:29.420
And then when you just have the time and take the time to talk about this stuff,

1126
01:09:30.590 --> 01:09:33.150
you just, it just feels a lot better. It feels like a,

1127
01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:38.180
like a bag of bricks on your, on your back. You just fall, fall off.

1128
01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:39.680
He's like, yeah, it feels good.

1129
01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:43.160
So I think of it the same way you were talking about physical therapy.

1130
01:09:43.660 --> 01:09:45.200
They're like, if you have a little injuries,

1131
01:09:45.201 --> 01:09:48.350
nagging injuries and get it massaged out and everything loosens up.

1132
01:09:48.590 --> 01:09:49.730
I think of at the same way,

1133
01:09:49.731 --> 01:09:54.260
if you're not taking a good account of what's going on in your mind,

1134
01:09:54.740 --> 01:09:58.400
you can develop like a little mental injuries. Yeah, exactly.

1135
01:09:58.401 --> 01:10:02.960
But for me, and maybe a lot of people have, maybe not nowadays,

1136
01:10:02.961 --> 01:10:04.680
but like from back in the days,

1137
01:10:04.690 --> 01:10:08.930
people still had like when you're talking to her psychology, you crazy know.

1138
01:10:11.410 --> 01:10:14.580
Yeah. That's what, that's how people in Holland, like, yeah.

1139
01:10:14.820 --> 01:10:18.320
Approached it all for here for a long time here for fighters.

1140
01:10:18.321 --> 01:10:22.190
It was the same thing. Like most fighters didn't need a psychologist.

1141
01:10:22.191 --> 01:10:26.230
That's not for winners. Winners know how to win. You just don't be a pussy.

1142
01:10:26.250 --> 01:10:28.880
Go out there and fucking fight. Yeah. But that's nonsense.

1143
01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:33.020
Like there's no pussies in professional fight, you know, you know,

1144
01:10:33.021 --> 01:10:37.760
but there is edge, you can get an edge, you can get an advantage.

1145
01:10:37.910 --> 01:10:41.810
Whether you get that advantage from getting massage or cryotherapy or from a

1146
01:10:41.811 --> 01:10:45.680
sports psychologist, there's advantages to be had. Yeah. So,

1147
01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:50.780
but I think that's where my, uh, when I got from my dad, it's just being tough,

1148
01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:55.160
being tough and being hard on yourself in whatever situation you're in.

1149
01:10:55.820 --> 01:10:59.810
Just be tough on yourself. And just because that's what he was,

1150
01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:03.950
he was tough on himself. And so that's what I got from him.

1151
01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:07.280
And, but now I just think like, okay,

1152
01:11:07.281 --> 01:11:11.200
just do tweak everything up and just get mentally imbalanced.

1153
01:11:11.201 --> 01:11:15.690
And especially when he passed away like almost two years ago, she just,

1154
01:11:16.140 --> 01:11:18.720
yeah, it was tough. It was tough, especially when the,

1155
01:11:18.740 --> 01:11:23.250
the relationship we had wasn't like, it was like on and off,

1156
01:11:23.251 --> 01:11:25.110
on and off. And when it was on,

1157
01:11:25.111 --> 01:11:30.111
it was like a lot of discretion and he just just hurts and then things happened

1158
01:11:30.331 --> 01:11:35.170
in your life and he just tried to process everything and give it a,

1159
01:11:35.171 --> 01:11:37.320
a certain spot.

1160
01:11:37.321 --> 01:11:42.321
But it's just hard sometimes and you just need somebody outside of your comfort

1161
01:11:42.571 --> 01:11:47.490
zone to talk about that. And yeah, that, that really,

1162
01:11:47.550 --> 01:11:51.720
that really worked and helped for me. So I'm, I'm very thankful for that.

1163
01:11:51.810 --> 01:11:54.210
And just, you know, I think I always,

1164
01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:59.010
how I approach things is everything in life happens for a reason,

1165
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:04.470
whatever, positive or negative. And sometimes you,

1166
01:12:04.750 --> 01:12:05.583
you know,

1167
01:12:05.610 --> 01:12:10.610
what happens and why it happened and sometimes you probably know it after like a

1168
01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:13.770
few years and maybe you'll never know it. But in my, my opinion,

1169
01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:17.670
everything in life, positive or negative happens for a reason.

1170
01:12:18.210 --> 01:12:21.440
And it's just, yeah, it's on you.

1171
01:12:21.450 --> 01:12:26.070
Whether you does that or doesn't. If you decide that it does

1172
01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:30.570
<v 2>that, it happens for a reason and you can find benefit in good or bad things,</v>

1173
01:12:30.810 --> 01:12:31.890
then it does happen for a reason.

1174
01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:35.250
But you make that distinction that it's going to be for your benefit,

1175
01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:39.360
that it can help you in the long run. That's the difference between a person who

1176
01:12:40.290 --> 01:12:41.570
<v 1>takes [inaudible],</v>

1177
01:12:42.060 --> 01:12:44.130
<v 2>things that happen, adversity in life,</v>

1178
01:12:44.131 --> 01:12:46.930
and decides that the world is against them. Yeah. Oh, I'm old.

1179
01:12:46.940 --> 01:12:48.810
I can't catch a break. The world's fucking me over.

1180
01:12:49.170 --> 01:12:52.920
Those people wind up becoming losers versus someone who says, you know what?

1181
01:12:52.950 --> 01:12:54.960
We're going to be fine. This is going to make me better.

1182
01:12:55.100 --> 01:12:58.050
It's gonna make me stronger. This is gonna make me understand I'm, I'm,

1183
01:12:58.080 --> 01:12:59.850
even though I'm more vulnerable right now,

1184
01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.800
this is going to make me understand myself better.

1185
01:13:01.801 --> 01:13:05.370
It's gonna ultimately make me better at everything I do. If you decide that,

1186
01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:07.550
then they do, then things do happen.

1187
01:13:08.150 --> 01:13:09.320
<v 1>Exactly. And that's,</v>

1188
01:13:09.890 --> 01:13:14.210
and that's one of the reasons I love watching your port podcast,

1189
01:13:14.211 --> 01:13:15.590
because that's what you bring.

1190
01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:20.870
And especially what I think for people that maybe sometimes struggle with

1191
01:13:20.930 --> 01:13:24.830
certain things or like you just explained in a situation where you think like,

1192
01:13:24.831 --> 01:13:27.020
fuck, what the fuck did I do to life?

1193
01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:31.100
That constantly ever been just backfires on me. It's,

1194
01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:36.410
I always think like you are responsible for the choices that you make in your

1195
01:13:36.411 --> 01:13:38.700
life. Nobody else. You're also

1196
01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:43.010
<v 2>possible for how you accept or how you focus on your life.</v>

1197
01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:46.940
Exactly how you think about things and how you, how you process it,

1198
01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:48.310
your response before.

1199
01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:50.480
<v 1>Yeah. So, and those,</v>

1200
01:13:50.510 --> 01:13:55.510
those are things like are so important to me and that's why I that and that's

1201
01:13:56.751 --> 01:13:57.584
what I mean with,

1202
01:13:57.590 --> 01:14:02.000
I try to surround myself with people that boost my flame

1203
01:14:03.590 --> 01:14:07.160
and just look at my phone and it's like go through it. Like who did I text?

1204
01:14:07.190 --> 01:14:11.530
Or who did I call? Like, you know, those people need to boost flame.

1205
01:14:11.531 --> 01:14:15.910
They need to be important in one way or the other doesn't.

1206
01:14:15.911 --> 01:14:20.911
It doesn't mean that they have to to to be important in business or in work or

1207
01:14:21.371 --> 01:14:24.640
it can be in every, in love or in family or whatever.

1208
01:14:24.730 --> 01:14:26.710
It needs to be important in some kind of way.

1209
01:14:26.711 --> 01:14:31.711
I just need to have positivity around me because I've seen so many negative

1210
01:14:32.171 --> 01:14:36.880
things from my family side that it's like it doesn't work.

1211
01:14:36.910 --> 01:14:40.720
Drains you. It drains you. And I believe like it's like Karma.

1212
01:14:41.770 --> 01:14:43.360
If you, you're negative,

1213
01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:47.170
you will attract more negative things.

1214
01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:51.100
If you're positive or positive, things will come your way.

1215
01:14:51.590 --> 01:14:54.400
I'm 100%. I believe that as well.

1216
01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:57.150
<v 2>Do you um, have uh,</v>

1217
01:14:57.330 --> 01:15:00.260
a visualization plan when you go into a fight,

1218
01:15:00.470 --> 01:15:03.510
like say like this rematch with bought her heart, do you,

1219
01:15:03.660 --> 01:15:06.770
you're going to sit down and visualize certain scenarios.

1220
01:15:06.980 --> 01:15:08.720
Do you train your,

1221
01:15:08.721 --> 01:15:13.721
your thought process to go over scenarios or to have a game plan in your mind,

1222
01:15:13.821 --> 01:15:16.580
the way execute the fight the way you would like to imagine it?

1223
01:15:17.130 --> 01:15:21.450
<v 1>Of course, of course. Think every fighter does. And</v>

1224
01:15:21.650 --> 01:15:23.060
<v 2>this is something you set aside,</v>

1225
01:15:23.061 --> 01:15:25.540
like do you meditate and set aside time to do that or do you just,

1226
01:15:26.330 --> 01:15:29.800
<v 1>no, it's just, just happens. You're just doing it all the time.</v>

1227
01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:33.470
You're in the car, you know? Right. Just, yeah,

1228
01:15:33.471 --> 01:15:36.500
just have them when you're under threat Neil, whatever, it just,

1229
01:15:37.370 --> 01:15:41.400
it just happens when you, you think about what's gonna,

1230
01:15:41.420 --> 01:15:45.560
what's going to happen in the upcoming months.

1231
01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:48.560
You just know that, okay this is going to be next level. Okay,

1232
01:15:48.561 --> 01:15:53.150
but how are we going to approach this fight? What is going to happen?

1233
01:15:53.420 --> 01:15:56.540
What might happen if he does this? I do that. Okay.

1234
01:15:56.541 --> 01:15:58.280
But this could happen and that could happen.

1235
01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:00.800
And in my mind before going into the fight,

1236
01:16:00.860 --> 01:16:03.800
I find it already like a thousand times or maybe even more,

1237
01:16:04.850 --> 01:16:06.410
cause you're thinking about this,

1238
01:16:07.820 --> 01:16:12.820
this person and this fight for so long and for like three or four months.

1239
01:16:13.100 --> 01:16:16.910
That's, that's a long time. So that happens. And

1240
01:16:18.510 --> 01:16:20.870
what I always feel like,

1241
01:16:20.900 --> 01:16:25.900
what's fun to people to realize is that my confidence level during a period of

1242
01:16:29.030 --> 01:16:33.950
like three, four months into a fight goes like up and down,

1243
01:16:33.951 --> 01:16:38.750
up and down. How has that past, you aren't at fucking best of what you do. Yes.

1244
01:16:39.570 --> 01:16:41.990
Mechanism in the,

1245
01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:46.370
in training and in camp and how does does it ass, I don't know.

1246
01:16:46.371 --> 01:16:50.420
But that is what happens. I think that happens to everybody.

1247
01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:54.020
So you just accept the process. You just accept the process. But it's such,

1248
01:16:54.410 --> 01:16:59.090
it's such a fucking frustrating process that when you're, when you're here,

1249
01:17:00.020 --> 01:17:02.150
just got to get back up there again.

1250
01:17:02.450 --> 01:17:07.450
But you know that it's part of the process because I've been doing this my whole

1251
01:17:07.551 --> 01:17:11.750
life, so I know it's part of the, but still it's frustrating. So,

1252
01:17:11.990 --> 01:17:14.420
and that's what, for example,

1253
01:17:14.790 --> 01:17:19.550
[inaudible] a mental coach and a psychologist can help you with to cope with

1254
01:17:19.551 --> 01:17:23.840
that at that moment so that you don't stay here in June,

1255
01:17:23.930 --> 01:17:28.720
do climb back up again. But it's, it's, and then you say, well,

1256
01:17:28.770 --> 01:17:32.660
but where does that come from? Can come from anywhere, you know,

1257
01:17:32.661 --> 01:17:36.170
from your body being tired. Like, hey,

1258
01:17:36.171 --> 01:17:39.470
why can't I cope with this training? Or why is this training getting to me?

1259
01:17:39.830 --> 01:17:42.140
Or during sparring,

1260
01:17:42.141 --> 01:17:47.141
why did I get get hit five times with the right hand and then block or react or

1261
01:17:48.031 --> 01:17:49.910
whatever. So it can come from anywhere.

1262
01:17:50.450 --> 01:17:54.080
And then the monotony of training as well, right? Yeah, yeah,

1263
01:17:54.410 --> 01:17:58.400
<v 0>yeah. So now this fight that's going to be happening in December, December 21st,</v>

1264
01:17:58.550 --> 01:18:01.860
how can people get it? Can, is it going to be available on a,

1265
01:18:01.861 --> 01:18:05.420
is it on UFC fight pass? Yeah, it's going to be UFC five pass

1266
01:18:05.870 --> 01:18:06.703
<v 1>and</v>

1267
01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:10.030
<v 0>I believe it's on ESPN as well. Okay.</v>

1268
01:18:11.380 --> 01:18:14.950
Zit ESPN two I think so too. But I'm not 100% sure. Well,

1269
01:18:14.951 --> 01:18:17.320
I'll find out and we'll make sure we tell everybody when,

1270
01:18:17.340 --> 01:18:19.330
when it's taking place. So, uh,

1271
01:18:19.540 --> 01:18:22.170
we'll make sure we get a bunch of people to watch out for, of course,

1272
01:18:22.660 --> 01:18:26.530
fucking very blunt. This is going to be kickboxing history. So it is,

1273
01:18:26.590 --> 01:18:30.190
it really is. Like you said, probably the biggest fight in kickboxing history.

1274
01:18:30.250 --> 01:18:34.990
Yeah. So it's, and then of course yet like back in the days we had so much,

1275
01:18:34.991 --> 01:18:38.050
so many great fights in it, the k one tournament and there was,

1276
01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:41.710
there was amazing. But this is just the, the one,

1277
01:18:41.711 --> 01:18:46.600
the biggest one on one fight and from this time, from this time, yeah.

1278
01:18:46.690 --> 01:18:49.630
And this era that everybody wants to see,

1279
01:18:49.990 --> 01:18:53.740
well I hope a million fucking people watching or more and I hope it really does

1280
01:18:53.741 --> 01:18:57.550
open up the door for bigger and bigger fights because I think that it's,

1281
01:18:57.940 --> 01:18:58.870
look glory's amazing.

1282
01:18:58.871 --> 01:19:03.400
You guys have so many incredibly talented fighters and so many high level

1283
01:19:03.401 --> 01:19:07.030
fights. I fucking love it man. I'm just such a huge fan.

1284
01:19:07.031 --> 01:19:11.530
I don't understand why it's not bigger in America. I know it's bigger in Europe,

1285
01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:12.793
but that's

1286
01:19:13.330 --> 01:19:17.950
<v 1>yeah, for us the same thing. So we just hope that during the years, you know,</v>

1287
01:19:17.951 --> 01:19:22.630
we just keep building it up, building it up and hope like, for example, with,

1288
01:19:22.870 --> 01:19:26.350
