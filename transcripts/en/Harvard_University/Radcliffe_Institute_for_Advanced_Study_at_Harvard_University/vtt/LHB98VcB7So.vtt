00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.262
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.620
-Good afternoon everyone,
and welcome to the Radcliffe

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.630
Institute for Advanced Study.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:11.450
I'm Liz Cohen.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.420
I'm Dean here at
the Institute, and I

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.840
am delighted to welcome
you to Radcliffe,

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.190
an institution powered
by the same commitment

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.620
to ideas and discovery
that HUBweek celebrates.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:29.690
HUBweek, a civic collaboration
between the Boston Globe, MIT,

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.400
Mass General
Hospital, and Harvard,

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.450
showcases innovation
and creativity

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.000
at the intersection of art,
science, and technology.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.380
The purpose of
HUBweek aligns closely

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.570
with Radcliffe's
own dual mission

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.570
of fostering advanced work
that transcends disciplines

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.850
and sharing that work
with the public, with you.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.040
In addition to serving as
dean of this institute,

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.610
I wear a second hat as
a professor of history

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.080
and American studies at Harvard.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.870
And today, I'm delighted
to tip both my dean's hat

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.060
and my professorial
hat to Professor Carol

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.030
Oja, my colleague
in American studies

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.170
and a fellow at the Radcliffe
Institute this year.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.630
And Carol will deliver
this afternoon's lecture,

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.940
as you know.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.250
I realize that today may
be the first introduction

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.960
to the Radcliffe
Institute for many of you.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.600
So I'd like to
just take a moment

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.010
to explain a bit more about
who we are and what we do.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.010
As Harvard's Institute
for Advanced Study,

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.360
Radcliffe is one
of the 13 schools

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.070
that make up Harvard University.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.000
As I mentioned a moment ago,
we carry out a dual mission.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.810
First, we cultivate a uniquely
interdisciplinary intellectual

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.940
community, in which faculty
and students from Harvard

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.180
and leading thinkers
from around the world all

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.830
engage in scholarship,
scientific investigation,

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.570
and the creative arts
across many academic fields.

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.550
And second, we are
dedicated to sharing

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.740
cutting edge work
with the public

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.919
by hosting free events
like today's lecture,

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:14.590
and then posting videos of
our lectures and conferences

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.230
on our Radcliffe website.

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.630
We pursue our dual mission
through three core programs.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.480
The first of our core programs
is our Radcliffe fellowship

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.140
program.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.120
Every year, we bring 50
scholars, scientists,

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.960
and artists to campus
as Fellows to work

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.260
at the forefront
of their fields and

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.920
across disciplinary boundaries.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.790
Today's speaker, Carol Oja is
this year's Frieda L. Miller

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.760
Fellow, and I'm very pleased to
have Frieda Miller's son, Myron

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.110
Miller, here with us today.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.470
The Frieda Miller Fellowship
was established in Frieda's name

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.330
by Myron's late
father, Herman Miller,

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.896
to honor Frieda's passionate
belief in higher education.

00:02:57.896 --> 00:03:01.340
And I have to say that I
have a special affection

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.690
for the Miller
Fellowship, for the Miller

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.970
family and the fellowship,
because the Frieda L. Miller

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.520
gift was, in fact, the gift
that funded my Radcliffe

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.010
Fellowship when I was a
Radcliffe Fellow in 2001 too.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.010
In addition to Carol,
this year's Fellows

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.970
include leading thinkers from
six different continents.

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.350
They are studying
everything from the origins

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.140
of the universe, to marvels
in late medieval literature,

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.590
to human rights
in Latin America.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.340
And this year's
artists are creating

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.910
everything from sculptures,
to poems, to operas.

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.870
Our second major program
is the Schlesinger Library,

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.650
which is the foremost
library dedicated

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.810
to the history of women and
gender in the United States.

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.260
Recently, the library has
made a substantial commitment

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.120
to telling the fullest,
most inclusive story

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.810
of the American
past by taking steps

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.930
to diversify our holdings to
include collections from women

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.060
and organizations across every
racial class, geographical,

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.070
and political divide.

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.060
To that end, the
Schlesinger Library

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.260
will be holding a
panel discussion

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.620
called "Righting the Record," on
Monday, October 17th, at 4:15.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.589
This program will consider
the challenges and the rewards

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:22.550
of collecting the papers
of political conservatives

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:23.870
and their organizations.

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.630
It will be moderated
by Ross Douthat, who's

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.806
a columnist at the
New York Times.

00:04:29.806 --> 00:04:33.180
Our third program we
call academic ventures,

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.220
and it hosts an array of
conferences, lectures,

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.390
exhibitions, and
performances that

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:40.460
are all open to the public.

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.920
For example, on Thursday,
October 13th at 4:15,

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.060
we'll be sponsoring a
panel discussion called

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.190
"Families in Flight,"
which will explore today's

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.870
international refugee crisis.

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.520
And I think you have a card
for that, the yellow card,

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.980
on your seat.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.620
Our annual full day
science symposium

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.160
will take place on
Friday, October 28,

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.210
beginning at 9:00 AM.

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.150
This year's symposium
is entitled "From Sea

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.740
to Changing Sea," and
it will investigate

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.490
the world's endangered oceans.

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.410
And I'm just going to
mention one more event.

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.380
You have the calendar cards
that will tell you about more.

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.680
But I think this may interest
the audience we have here

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.570
today.

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:25.300
Garth Risk Hallberg, who
is the author of a widely

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.400
acclaimed novel
called City on Fire,

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.660
set in New York
City in the 1970s.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.900
And he will be
talking about his book

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.370
and about the challenges
of writing fiction

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.780
about a specific time and place.

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.110
That will take place on
Tuesday, November 15th.

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.120
All of these events
will take place here

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.330
at the Knafel Center, along
with many others, as I said,

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.540
that are listed on that card.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.720
You can also visit our website
and learn about our calendar.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.450
And there, you can register
for lectures and conferences

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:58.230
and watch videos
of previous events.

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:01.200
So I hope we will see you
often in the year ahead.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.480
All these events are free
and open to the public.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.130
But in many cases, we
ask you to register ahead

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:10.310
so we can be sure to
accommodate the audience.

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.950
The Radcliffe Institute
is a busy place.

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:15.040
But no matter how
busy, the heart

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.360
of any institute
for advanced study

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.130
is it's fellowship program.

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:22.180
And I'm very pleased to offer
you this glimpse into ours

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.530
through the work of
our Fellow, Carol Oja.

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:29.560
Carol is a scholar of
musicology, history,

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:30.770
and literature.

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.460
She's also a star
teacher, which I

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.770
happen to know because I
have seen her in action.

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:38.610
One semester, and
this was actually

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:40.650
quite a number of
years ago already,

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.240
I was teaching a graduate class
on the City in 20th Century

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.610
American Culture, and
Carol was teaching

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:49.980
another graduate seminar
in the music department.

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:52.370
And we brought our
classes together

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:56.870
for a session on Shuffle Along,
a 1920s musical featuring

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:59.690
an all African American cast.

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:02.570
During that joint
class, I was extremely

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:07.520
impressed by Carol's talent
for operating on two scales.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.250
She drew students
deep into discussion

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:13.140
about how each
chord and each lyric

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:16.140
was the product of the
composer's deliberate

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:17.360
decisions.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:22.410
But she also never lost sight
of the larger historical context

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:25.030
in which those
choices were made.

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:28.310
Her probing questions
revealed critical insights

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:32.780
into the racial politics
of New York in the 1920s.

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:35.770
Much like her teaching,
Carol's repertoire

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:38.930
of written scholarship
operates on two registers

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:41.050
and in multiple keys.

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:43.750
In her book, Making
Music Modern,

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:48.210
she examines the artistic
and historic forces at work

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:51.610
in New York's creative
explosion of the 1920s.

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:55.660
Like a pianist's fingers working
to produce rich harmonic tones,

00:07:55.660 --> 00:08:00.360
her prose moves nimbly from
probing the composition

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.690
of melody on the one
hand to assessing

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:06.450
the impact of
international politics

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:09.380
on cultural production
on the other.

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:12.660
In her book, Bernstein
Meets Broadway,

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:16.270
Carol follows the
Boston-born Leonard Bernstein

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:20.010
from his boyhood here in the hub
through the social and cultural

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:22.940
politics of the US at war.

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:26.250
She remains attentive
to each sharp and flat

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:29.840
in Bernstein's score to his
hit musical On the Town,

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:33.960
and at the same time, she
never forgets the tragedy

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:38.740
of a Japanese-American Broadway
star enchanting audiences

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:42.549
while her father languished
in an internment camp.

00:08:42.549 --> 00:08:44.870
Nor does she overlook
the bitter irony

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:48.550
of African-American performers
finally making their way

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:52.060
into integrated orchestras
and chorus lines,

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:55.830
even as African-American
GIs in World War II

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:58.890
remained barred from any
fighting military units

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:01.140
and from any public
accommodations

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:03.660
throughout the United States.

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:07.600
Now today, Carol will be
sharing with us some new work.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:11.020
She will take a close look
at the role of concert singer

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:15.070
Marian Anderson in the long
fight against segregation

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:17.030
in the United States.

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:21.120
This talk is part of Carol's
fellowship project, an inquiry

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.850
into the racial politics of
classical music performance

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:27.150
in post-war America.

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:30.300
That project is a
striking illustration

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:33.780
of exactly the sort of
interdisciplinary study

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:37.020
that we at Radcliffe
strive to make possible.

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:40.050
Carol's work, like that
of many of our Fellows,

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:42.880
crosses those traditional
disciplinary boundaries

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:46.680
to help us see and understand
the world in new ways.

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.870
So now, I ask you to please
join me in welcoming Carol Oja.

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:51.866
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:09.209 --> 00:10:09.750
-Thanks, Liz.

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:12.110
It was a very
generous introduction.

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:15.490
And I'm really grateful to be
here at Radcliffe this year.

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:19.890
It seems like just a small
and short step across Mass Ave

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:21.220
from the music department.

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:23.340
But in fact, it's a
pretty big distance

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:25.850
in terms of just
how my time is spent

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:27.945
and in terms of meeting
a new group of people

00:10:27.945 --> 00:10:29.445
with the other
Fellows at Radcliffe.

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:37.430
Memory shifts over time, as
does the collective perception

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:40.680
of who constitutes a
major historical figure,

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:43.640
and what events are viewed
as cultural landmarks.

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:46.000
Not so long ago,
a concert given by

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.080
the great African-American
contralto, Marian Anderson,

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:52.370
on the steps of the
Lincoln Memorial in 1939

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:55.610
was hailed widely as a
catalyzing event in the Civil

00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:57.160
Rights Movement.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.280
It was routine to
narratives of the struggle,

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:02.250
and it served as a visual
and strategic prelude

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:04.800
to the March on Washington,
when Martin Luther King

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:10.030
Jr. delivered his famous, "I
Have a Dream," speech in 1963.

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:13.190
Anderson's extraordinary
outdoor performance

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:16.180
was the first massive
staging of passive resistance

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:18.940
on behalf of civil rights
at the Lincoln Memorial.

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:22.080
And the concert attracted
a racially integrated crowd

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:25.250
of some 75,000 people.

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:29.190
A new design for the $5 bill
which was announced last spring

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:30.365
honors that history.

00:11:30.365 --> 00:11:32.990
It will retain
Lincoln on the front,

00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:35.650
but be reworked on the back
to feature historic events

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:36.560
at the memorial.

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:39.490
Marian Anderson will
be part of that scheme,

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:42.490
together with Martin Luther
King and First Lady Eleanor

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:44.400
Roosevelt.

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.720
Even though Anderson will
be one of the first women

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:50.390
to appear on US paper
money in a very long time,

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:53.260
and even though she is among
the first African Americans ever

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.980
to be represented there, she is
far less known today than once

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:58.450
was the case.

00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:00.300
When the new $5
bill was announced

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:02.910
by Secretary of the
Treasury, Jacob Lew,

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:07.010
Newsweek ran a story titled,
"Who is Marian Anderson?"

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:10.560
giving a vivid sense of
how memories are fading.

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.610
In Secretary Lew's
press release,

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:16.820
he described Anderson as "a
world-renowned opera singer."

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:20.330
And today, I want to query
that characterization.

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:24.700
World-renowned is apt, but
opera is deeply problematic

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:27.530
given the fact that Anderson,
like all gifted black

00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:30.990
performers of her day,
faced structural segregation

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:33.380
in the country's
opera houses, indeed,

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:37.050
in most of its institutions
of elite musical culture.

00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:38.980
This afternoon, I will
start by exploring

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:42.730
a few highly publicized
moments in Anderson's career,

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:45.610
viewing them in relation
to segregationist practices

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:48.490
in the concert venues
where she performed.

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:51.640
My ultimate focus will be to
shape a contextual history

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.640
of Anderson's debut
at the Metropolitan

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.890
Opera in New York
City, which took place

00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:59.200
on January 7th, 1955.

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:01.340
It was the first time
that a singer of color

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:03.580
was featured by that
internationally-recognized

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:07.460
company since its
founding in 1880.

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:10.450
With Marian Anderson, there's
a solid literature, much of it

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:14.560
indebted to a rich biography
of Allan Keiler from Brandeis.

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.810
Wallace Cheatham has also
been an important figure

00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:19.840
in chronicling the history
of black opera singers.

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.490
My goal is to shift
the angle of inquiry

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:25.790
to focus on racial practices
in the American infrastructure

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:30.030
of classical music, and the
impact of those practices

00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:32.810
on gifted performers
like Anderson.

00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:35.570
So first, let's get
acquainted, or for some of you,

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:38.015
I'm sure, acquainted,
with Marian Anderson.

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:42.840
One of the most widely
acclaimed performers

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.945
of the mid-20th century,
Anderson attained

00:13:44.945 --> 00:13:48.040
a degree of celebrity
that's hard to grasp today,

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:50.290
since classical music
no longer occupies

00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:54.540
the same broad-based
popularity in American culture.

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:59.300
Born in 1897, she launched
her career in the early 1920s

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:01.564
and retired in 1965.

00:14:01.564 --> 00:14:02.980
I'm just going to
pause over that,

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:05.310
because that is a
very long career.

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:08.020
She first came to attention
in the white concert world

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:12.770
in 1925, when she won a
vocal competition sponsored

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:15.700
by the National Musical League
at the New York Philharmonic's

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:19.890
Stadium Concerts, a summertime
outdoor series in Lewisohn

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:23.270
Stadium at City
College in Harlem.

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:26.610
By doing so, Anderson defied
every racial inclusion in place

00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:28.600
at the time, winning
the competition

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:31.020
through the force of her talent.

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:34.020
As a result, she made a
debut with the Philharmonic

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:37.210
at the stadium that same
summer, and the stadium concerts

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:39.980
became a site for
desegregation overall.

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:43.170
Open air venues seemed
more amenable to change

00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:46.960
than the close confines
of an indoor hall.

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:50.790
The depth of Anderson's talent
was proclaimed time and again,

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:54.500
most famously by the Italian
conductor Arturo Toscanini,

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:58.150
who after hearing her
perform in Salzburg in 1935,

00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:01.680
declared that she had a voice
so exceptional as to appear

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:04.190
only once in 100 years.

00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:07.400
Toscanini was quoted frequently
in the ensuing decades

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.690
as superlatives flowed from
the critical establishment.

00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:14.870
Anderson sang for kings and
queens and American presidents.

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:17.960
She filled concert halls
and open air stadiums,

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:21.330
often jam-packed to the
limits of fire regulations.

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:23.560
She toured the
country and the world,

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:26.680
giving an astounding number
of concerts each year.

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:30.080
And she recorded prodigiously,
and was a regular fixture

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:34.350
on the radio, with television
appearances as well.

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:37.080
In short, Anderson
became a superstar,

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:41.140
with autograph seekers
lining up after her concerts.

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:45.700
In 1941, there were reportedly
27 Marion Anderson fan clubs

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:48.150
across the United States.

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:50.130
Yet she achieved
this popular acclaim

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:53.790
within the largely white
classical music business.

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:56.350
Performers who made their
living by interpreting music

00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:58.620
from the revered
European tradition

00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:02.070
were almost exclusively
of European descent.

00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:05.570
Segregation also held firm in
the country's leading music

00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:07.890
conservatories, which
only gradually started

00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:09.330
to admit black students.

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:11.370
And in fact, Marian
Anderson never

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:14.590
studied at any of the
major conservatories.

00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:15.550
It wasn't impossible.

00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:18.650
Hiring practices and systems
of critical evaluation

00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:21.540
were racially determined,
with white performers

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:23.440
assumed as the norm.

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:25.430
This is not only the
case in the South,

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:27.640
but also in the
urban North, notably

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:32.280
in New York City, the epicenter
of American classical music.

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:36.590
In a minute, we will hear
Marian Anderson in 1951

00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:40.720
performing "Der Erlkonig,"
a renowned 19th century art

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:44.290
song by Franz Schubert, which
became one of her greatest

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:45.470
hits.

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:47.350
Franz Rupp is at the piano.

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:50.570
He became Anderson's
accompanist in 1941,

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:54.550
and the two worked together
until the end of her career.

00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:57.150
Set to a poem by
Goethe, "Der Erlkonig"

00:16:57.150 --> 00:17:00.840
tells a story of a father who
carries his son on horseback

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:02.610
in a terrifying ride.

00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:06.069
The son senses an evil spirit,
and the father repeatedly

00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:08.560
reassures him that it's
a natural phenomenon,

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:11.800
such as the wind, or in the
excerpt you're about to hear,

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.420
the ancient willows.

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:15.599
The conclusion is
devastating, with the child

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:18.859
suddenly dead in
his father's arms.

00:17:18.859 --> 00:17:20.569
The performer of
"Der Erlkonig" needs

00:17:20.569 --> 00:17:22.740
to have the dramatic
capacity to depict

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:27.369
four characters, a narrator,
the father, the son,

00:17:27.369 --> 00:17:29.000
and the Erlking.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.070
Shifting ranges are
key to conveying

00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:33.340
the different
personalities, and the song

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:36.830
has mostly been identified
with male performers.

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:41.270
For Anderson, as a contralto,
meaning a low alto,

00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:42.980
"Der Erlkonig"
offered an opportunity

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:45.950
to showcase the tremendous
range of her voice,

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:48.410
including its beautiful
lower registers.

00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:50.230
It also displayed
the deep empathy

00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:52.060
of her interpretive talent.

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:54.730
This excerpt includes the
shattering conclusion.

00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:56.813
[MUSIC PLAYING - MARIAN
 ANDERSON, "DER ERLKONIG"]

00:17:56.813 --> 00:17:59.904
-[SINGING IN GERMAN]

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:06.550
-Thus, Anderson was
known to music lovers

00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:09.220
around the world as recitalist.

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:11.940
Before tackling the
vexed term of "opera,"

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:15.020
let's explore her most
famous historical moment

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:19.100
which, in many ways, defined
her career and her public image.

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:21.560
This, of course, was the
concert at the Lincoln Memorial

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:24.220
on Easter Sunday in 1939.

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:28.200
Through an intense get out the
crowd Initiative by the NAACP,

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.400
Anderson performed to
an enormous mixed race

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:33.440
audience, a sea of
diversity that stretched out

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.050
from the memorial.

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:37.510
A headline in the New
York Herald Tribune

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:40.470
described her concert as
"the biggest assemblage

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:44.060
since the welcome of
Lindbergh in 1927."

00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:47.240
Just a few months before the
event, Anderson's manager,

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:50.080
Sol Hurok, perhaps the
most powerful such figure

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:52.190
in performance
business at the time,

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:54.000
had attempted to book
a concert for her

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.570
at Constitution Hall in
Washington DC, which was then

00:19:57.570 --> 00:20:00.200
the District's central
performance facility, home

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:03.210
to the National Symphony
Orchestra and the Washington

00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:04.980
Opera.

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:08.090
This was three decades before
the opening of the Kennedy

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:09.960
Center for the Performing Arts.

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:11.870
Constitution Hall was
owned by the Daughters

00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:14.330
of the American Revolution,
and its management

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:17.650
turned down Hurok's request,
claiming that the facility was

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:18.880
already booked.

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:23.340
In fact, the DAR was enforcing
the whites-only clause

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:24.610
in its contract.

00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:27.110
By that point in
her career, Anderson

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:29.710
had performed in the
great concert facilities

00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:31.700
of Europe and the US.

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.490
Her exclusion on
the basis of race

00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:36.590
was taken up by
Walter White of NAACP,

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:38.060
who worked in
close collaboration

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:40.290
with Hurok, using
Anderson's case

00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:42.810
to contest the widespread
segregation of concert

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:45.970
venues and other public spaces.

00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:48.400
An intense lobbying
campaign ensued,

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.920
and a Marion Anderson
Committee was

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:54.550
formed, with Charles H.
Houston, a prominent NAACP

00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:57.110
litigator as its attorney.

00:20:57.110 --> 00:21:00.640
First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt
famously resigned from the DAR

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:01.830
in protest.

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:04.970
And Harold Ickes, then
Secretary of the Interior,

00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:07.920
took up the cause, which
led to locating the event

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:09.780
at the Lincoln Memorial.

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:13.490
As Ickes put it, in introducing
Anderson at the concert,

00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:15.460
"the Memorial was
a great auditorium

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:19.390
under the sky, in which
all of us are free."

00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:21.590
The Chicago Defender,
one of the country's

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:25.720
leading black newspapers,
declared "intolerance

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:28.240
received one of the
heaviest blows of the ages

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.740
on Easter Sunday.

00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:33.110
A huge crowd estimated
at 75,000 persons,

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:35.900
as varicolored as the
Easter season itself,

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:38.210
paid homage to a great
singer in a scene

00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:41.110
which in its symbolism
and poignancy

00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:44.050
surpassed any words that
might be used to describe it.

00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:47.060
All seemed to mingle
with one common interest,

00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:49.020
the determination to
welcome the greatest

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:54.300
singer of this generation and
to show that tolerance lives."

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:58.200
Anderson's concert was
broadcast nationally,

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:01.410
thus heard by millions,
and it was also filmed.

00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:03.940
Here is a clip of her
elegantly claiming

00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:06.700
the status of a
diva in a mink coat,

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:08.860
singing "America the Beautiful."

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:12.190
She approaches it like an
art song with crisp diction,

00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:15.330
and it's clear she owns
the song's message.

00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:18.580
Her accompanist is the Finnish
pianist and composer Kosti

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:22.330
Vehanen, whom Anderson
worked with until 1940

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:25.240
when World War II drew him home.

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:28.040
The film provides very quick
glimpses is the mixed race

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:29.030
audience.

00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:30.450
And you'll notice
that Anderson is

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:34.555
singing at the high end
of her three octave range.

00:22:34.555 --> 00:22:36.010
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:43.285
Genius draws no color lines.

00:22:43.285 --> 00:22:48.385
And so it is fitting that Marion
Anderson should raise her voice

00:22:48.385 --> 00:22:53.676
in tribute to the noble Lincoln,
who mankind will ever honor.

00:22:53.676 --> 00:22:55.564
Miss Marion Anderson.

00:22:55.564 --> 00:22:57.480
[MUSIC PLAYING - MARIAN
ANDERSON, "MY COUNTRY,

00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:59.043
'TIS OF THEE"]

00:23:01.528 --> 00:23:14.450
--[SINGING] My country, 'tis of
thee, sweet land of liberty,

00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:19.420
of thee we sing.

00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:32.342
Land where my fathers died,
land of the pilgrim's pride,

00:23:32.342 --> 00:23:42.282
from every mountain
side, let freedom ring.

00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:51.080
-In the mid 1950s, the New
York music critic Hugh Thompson

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:53.250
interviewed Anderson and
asked if the Daughters

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:56.870
of the American Revolution
had ever apologized to her.

00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:57.700
She paused.

00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:00.340
He recounted, "and a
momentary look in her eyes

00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:04.010
told me she still felt
the sting of that insult."

00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:07.590
"Not that I was ever
aware of," she said.

00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:10.690
Despite her symbolic power
on behalf of civil rights,

00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:14.760
Anderson never became an
outspoken racial protester.

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:16.990
But that doesn't mean
she lacked agency

00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:18.990
in taking courageous steps.

00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:21.810
Rather, her resistance
was performed on stage

00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:24.050
with a consistent
assertion of high level

00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:26.480
professionalism as her weapon.

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:28.070
Over and over, she
made the choice

00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:30.670
to sing in racially-fraught
settings, where she

00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:34.030
majestically delivered her art.

00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:36.210
Viewed as a whole,
Anderson's career

00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:39.590
provides a granular view
of the astounding battle,

00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:41.570
the mind-numbing
details that were

00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:44.310
involved in maintaining
segregation, and then

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:45.830
dismantling it.

00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:47.720
Ticketing and
seating for concerts

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:50.530
moved from
whites-only audiences,

00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:53.510
to what was termed
"horizontal segregation,"

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:56.950
with people of color in the back
of the hall and the balcony.

00:24:56.950 --> 00:25:00.650
Then came vertical segregation,
with a literal line drawn down

00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:03.780
the center of auditoriums
to separate the races.

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:07.000
Hard as it is to grasp today,
the vertical arrangement

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.920
was once viewed as
a sign of progress.

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:13.960
In a letter to the New
York Times in 1989,

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:17.140
a man identifying himself
as a tobacco employee who

00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:19.510
traveled regularly
through the South,

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:22.900
noted that when the Metropolitan
Opera visited Houston,

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:26.000
people of color were
prohibited from attending.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.200
He described a concert
there by Anderson

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:30.301
with vertical segregation.

00:25:30.301 --> 00:25:33.730
"The concert in Houston was
given in the Civic Auditorium

00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:37.270
before an audience of 5,000,
approximately one third of them

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:38.430
Negroes.

00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:41.210
The house was cut vertically
from top to bottom

00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:44.380
with Negroes on all floors,
but occupying the third to one

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:45.960
side of the stage.

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:47.850
When Ms. Anderson made
her first appearance,

00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:50.500
she bowed perfunctorily
straight in front of her.

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:53.420
Then turned deliberately
toward those of her own race

00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:55.620
and bowed very low and long.

00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:57.570
It was the most beautiful
and most queenly

00:25:57.570 --> 00:25:59.450
gesture I have ever seen."

00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:02.900
And of course, the word
Negro was used commonly

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:03.900
during this period.

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:06.340
You're going to hear it a
lot in quotations today,

00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:11.790
and it didn't have the
same stigma as it now does.

00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:15.070
Anderson was a hard worker,
giving some 60 concerts

00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:17.360
a year at her peak,
with repeated tours

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:18.690
through the South.

00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:21.310
In 1950, she spoke of
how it was right for her

00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:23.000
to go to the South,
even though it

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.760
meant that she traveled
with her own pots and pans

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:28.920
to avoid segregated restaurants,
and even though she often

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:31.210
stayed in private homes.

00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:34.140
On almost every trip Anderson
stated, "I give concerts

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:36.210
in places I've
never been before.

00:26:36.210 --> 00:26:38.740
And a number of my people
get a great deal more out

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:40.810
of actually seeing
a person than they

00:26:40.810 --> 00:26:42.910
do by hearing about
the artist or hearing

00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:44.750
the performance on the radio.

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:49.290
Seeing a person, some of
them can be inspired."

00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:52.940
As was the case with most
black artists performing

00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:56.890
in the South, Anderson
risked facing violence.

00:26:56.890 --> 00:27:00.770
After 1951 or so, her
performance contracts

00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:03.410
included a clause
prohibiting segregation

00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:05.090
in audience seating.

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:07.700
Enforcing that clause
brought difficulties,

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:10.860
and her manager, Sol
Hurok, stood firm.

00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:13.130
As one example,
Anderson gave back

00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:17.990
to back concerts in Jacksonville
and Miami in January of 1952.

00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:19.660
And because of her
contract clause,

00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:21.620
audiences were
reportedly integrated

00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:25.720
for the first time in the
state, albeit contentiously so.

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:30.190
The events put Anderson on
the cover of Jet magazine.

00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:32.830
Although both programs
went off without incident

00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:35.480
Ms. Anderson received the
largest police protection

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:37.500
ever given an artist in Miami.

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:41.480
50 plainclothes officers,
including FBI agents,

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:45.010
circulated constantly
through the audience.

00:27:45.010 --> 00:27:48.420
The article goes on to
note that the KKK held

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:50.640
what was termed a
"routine meeting" outside

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:55.720
of Jacksonville during
Anderson's performance there.

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:57.890
Studying Marian
Anderson in relation

00:27:57.890 --> 00:28:00.380
to institutional
segregation means

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:03.620
probing a complex network
of racial and performance

00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:04.820
challenges.

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:06.820
Obviously, the
question of geography

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:10.000
was central, with the South
yielding the most problems.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.370
But the urban North also
had its Jim Crow practices,

00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:16.940
and so here are some
of the issues involved.

00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:20.180
For one thing, Anderson
faced strong opinions

00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:22.620
from both blacks and
whites about the race

00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:24.940
of her accompanist and
how she would interact

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:27.010
with that person on stage.

00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:29.840
She had three main accompanists
over the course of her career,

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:31.510
and all were male.

00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:34.380
The first was William
King, known as Billy,

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:37.380
who was from Anderson's
hometown of Philadelphia.

00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:39.580
King accompanied
Anderson for her debut

00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:41.554
at the New York
stadium concerts,

00:28:41.554 --> 00:28:42.970
and they worked
together until she

00:28:42.970 --> 00:28:46.870
began making extended trips
to Europe in the late 1920s

00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:48.470
and the 1930s.

00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:51.650
Before then, a large percentage
of Anderson's engagements

00:28:51.650 --> 00:28:56.110
came from black venues and
community organizations.

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:58.350
While in Europe, Anderson
began collaborating

00:28:58.350 --> 00:28:59.940
with Kosti Vehanan.

00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:03.640
And when Sol Hurok took
over her management in 1935,

00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:06.120
he persuaded her to
continue working with Kosti

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:08.350
when she returned to
the United States.

00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:11.220
This meant ending her
partnership with William King,

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:12.850
which was fraught to do.

00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:14.820
It also raised concerns
about performing

00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:17.280
with a white pianist
in US concerts,

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:20.390
sponsored, quote,
"under Negro auspices,"

00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:24.410
as Anderson wrote to Claude
Barnett of the Associated Negro

00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:26.540
Press in 1935.

00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:30.190
The ANP was a black
news syndicate.

00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:33.160
Later, when Anderson began
working with the German emigre

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:37.370
Franz Rupp, the two often
shook hands or even held hands

00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:40.120
while taking bows, as is
traditional for performers

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:42.600
within the European
concert tradition.

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:44.910
Objections were raised
in some American cities

00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:48.180
about interracial touching,
but the two stood firm.

00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:51.070
And Rupp was the one who
usually made a genial, but clear

00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:53.890
statement to the press.

00:29:53.890 --> 00:29:56.460
Another issue had to do
with the racial heritage

00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:58.480
of the music being performed.

00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:00.670
In her programming,
Anderson consistently

00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:03.850
followed the model of her
black predecessors, especially

00:30:03.850 --> 00:30:06.520
Henry T. Burleigh
and Roland Hayes,

00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:09.040
by opening with European
repertory, usually

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:11.930
a balance of opera,
arias, and art songs,

00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:14.470
and ending with concert
arrangements of what were then

00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:17.150
called Negro spirituals.

00:30:17.150 --> 00:30:20.770
This program, from an
NAACP sponsored concert

00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:23.410
in West Virginia
in the late 1930s,

00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:25.540
illustrates the standard format.

00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:27.980
Two of the arrangers listed
there were African American,

00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:30.790
Burleigh and Florence Price.

00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:34.970
The spirituals constituted a
kind of political statement,

00:30:34.970 --> 00:30:38.410
asserting that this repertory
identified with slavery

00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:40.720
deserved an equal status
with revered works

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:43.080
from the Austro-German
tradition.

00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:45.890
Yet Anderson's
renditions of spirituals

00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:48.940
faced racialized
expectations, with her viewers

00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:51.230
and the white press
often seeming preoccupied

00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:53.090
by the spirituals
while paying less

00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:56.230
attention to the other
repertory she performed.

00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:58.940
The racial assumptions
could be crude.

00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:02.430
For example, after a recital
at New York City's Town Hall

00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:06.120
in 1935, an event
billed as her homecoming

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:08.620
after four years
of working abroad,

00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:10.350
a critic for the New
York Herald Tribune

00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:13.720
called spirituals "the most
thrilling work" on her recital.

00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:16.960
He continued, "these
the singer wisely

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:20.220
did not attempt to sing in
the manner of an art song,

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:24.850
but rather a musical reflection
of indigenous attributes."

00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:25.770
What does that mean?

00:31:25.770 --> 00:31:26.682
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:31.950
-In 1943, the composer and
critic Virgil Thompson,

00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:34.010
known for his arch
pronouncements that

00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:38.150
often carried a sting, wrote
that "when Anderson gets down

00:31:38.150 --> 00:31:41.460
to singing in her own
language, the religious music

00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:44.060
of her own people,
that is where she

00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:49.510
leaves off being a lovely
icicle and becomes a flame."

00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:51.980
In the face of such
comments, Anderson

00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:54.000
could have avoided
the spirituals.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.230
Instead, she doubled down,
continuing over the decades

00:31:57.230 --> 00:31:59.510
to assert the repertory
as a central part

00:31:59.510 --> 00:32:01.530
of her artistic identity.

00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:04.260
To sample this aspect
of Anderson's legacy,

00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:08.570
here she is performing "He's Got
the Whole World in His Hands,"

00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:11.180
which is among her core works.

00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:13.640
The arrangement is
by Hamilton Forrest.

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:16.440
Franz Rupp is at the
piano, and the performance

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:19.290
was recorded around 1950.

00:32:19.290 --> 00:32:22.320
Anderson performed the
same spiritual at the March

00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:25.100
on Washington in 1963.

00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:29.045
It's not great film quality,
but you get the idea.

00:32:29.045 --> 00:32:30.420
[MUSIC PLAYING -
MARIAN ANDERSON,

00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:32.222
"HE'S GOT THE WHOLE
WORLD IN HIS HANDS"]

00:32:32.222 --> 00:32:36.206
--[SINGING] He's got the
whole world in his hands.

00:32:36.206 --> 00:32:39.194
He's got the world in his hands.

00:32:39.194 --> 00:32:42.680
He's got the wide
world in his hands.

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:46.166
He's got the whole

He's got the wind and

He's got the sun and the

He's got the whole

He's got the light.

00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:02.920
-Franz Rupp was a
fine accompanist,

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:06.130
as I'm sure you can hear.

00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:08.230
Yet another racial
issue had to do

00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:12.210
with Hurok Attractions,
Andersen's management from 1935

00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:15.700
on, which had to adapt from
the habits of only representing

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:16.360
white artists.

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:19.210
They'd only had one artist
of color before her,

00:33:19.210 --> 00:33:22.240
and it was not someone with
the same impact and breadth

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:23.780
of career.

00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:26.280
This affected many details
of putting on concerts,

00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:29.860
including the need for a mixed
race network for promotion

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:31.850
and newspaper criticism.

00:33:31.850 --> 00:33:33.440
For example, there
was the question

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:36.130
of who should be
offered press passes.

00:33:36.130 --> 00:33:38.570
Claude Barnett of the
Associated Negro Press

00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:42.920
took up the battle, writing to
Hurok's office in January 1936.

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:45.170
So this is at the very
beginning of the time

00:33:45.170 --> 00:33:47.400
when Anderson worked with Hurok.

00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:50.320
That Anderson's recent
concert, the ANP's New York

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:53.540
representative, quote, "was
not accorded the courtesies

00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:55.690
which one of his
standing and capability

00:33:55.690 --> 00:33:57.530
had a right to expect."

00:33:57.530 --> 00:34:00.730
To its credit, the Hurok
agency regrouped immediately,

00:34:00.730 --> 00:34:03.040
asking for the names
of ANP correspondents

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:05.030
who were assigned to
New York concerts.

00:34:05.030 --> 00:34:07.690
And they followed through.

00:34:07.690 --> 00:34:10.409
Finally, Anderson
and Hurok had to cope

00:34:10.409 --> 00:34:13.780
with the racial policies and
practices of the country's most

00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:15.960
illustrious concert facilities.

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:19.080
Earlier I mentioned a pair
of incidents in Florida.

00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:22.860
But segregation wasn't always
so clear cut in New York City.

00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:25.260
Town Hall had a strong
history of featuring

00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:26.750
performers of color.

00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:31.610
Other facilities were also open,
albeit often with limitations.

00:34:31.610 --> 00:34:34.409
Here was a fundamental
issue for Anderson.

00:34:34.409 --> 00:34:37.929
There was a basic difference
between renting a facility

00:34:37.929 --> 00:34:42.030
rather than being hired by its
most prominent and eponymous

00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:46.770
performance organization, which
leads us to Marian Anderson's

00:34:46.770 --> 00:34:51.870
debut with the Metropolitan
Opera in January 1955.

00:34:51.870 --> 00:34:55.219
It was the second most
famous event in her career.

00:34:55.219 --> 00:34:57.390
And it was just as
momentous for the Met,

00:34:57.390 --> 00:35:01.010
ending a 75 year history
of racial exclusion.

00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:03.160
In histories of the
Metropolitan Opera,

00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:07.290
there's a gaping silence about
the company's racial practices.

00:35:07.290 --> 00:35:09.770
Anderson's debut
is routinely noted

00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:12.440
as a positive development,
but the long period

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:16.450
in which the company practiced
a whites-only policy is ignored.

00:35:16.450 --> 00:35:20.270
The silence was established
in part by the white press.

00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:24.130
Black newspapers, by contrast,
decried the company repeatedly

00:35:24.130 --> 00:35:25.480
over the decades.

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:29.070
In 1944, for example,
Baltimore's Afro-American

00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:33.770
excoriated the Met for what it
called "an Aryans-only policy."

00:35:33.770 --> 00:35:36.440
And for those of you
who are historians

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:38.810
in archival research,
you know that it's only

00:35:38.810 --> 00:35:42.080
within the last 10 to 15 years
that black newspapers have been

00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:44.490
digitized, which has
transformed everything

00:35:44.490 --> 00:35:48.740
in terms of doing the kind of
research I'm now involved in.

00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:51.950
Civil rights historians
talk about studying a nation

00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:54.860
within a nation when
they study black culture.

00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:59.180
And musically, that's as true
as it is in any other dimension.

00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:01.130
So for me, the black
newspapers are really

00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:05.270
crucial to flip a perspective
on classical music performance

00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:08.140
by artists of color.

00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:10.630
With the Met, racial
change came about through

00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:13.810
a protracted effort on the part
of civil rights organizations,

00:36:13.810 --> 00:36:16.150
black newspapers, and
progressive whites

00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:17.650
in positions of power.

00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:21.190
In Anderson's case, the latter
included Sol Hurok and Howard

00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:24.910
Taubman of the New York Times,
who grew increasingly outspoken

00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:26.580
as the years passed.

00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:29.250
As a result, Anderson's
debut at the Met

00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:31.930
didn't appear as a
magical change in attitude

00:36:31.930 --> 00:36:34.150
on the part of the
company, but rather

00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:36.180
was the result of a
multi-year lobbying

00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:38.430
campaign, a breakthrough
that occurred

00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:42.770
when she was 58 years old,
past the prime of any singer.

00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:45.760
Beginning in April
1943, just a few years

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:48.280
after Anderson's triumph
at the Lincoln Memorial,

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:51.540
she began asserting her
presence on the Met stage.

00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:54.070
To challenge the opera
company's racial exclusions,

00:36:54.070 --> 00:36:56.660
Sol Hurok instead made
the symbolic gesture

00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:59.250
of renting the hall,
with Anderson physically

00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:01.210
occupying it and
filling the house

00:37:01.210 --> 00:37:04.640
with her glorious voice in spite
of the company's prejudices.

00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:06.530
She consistently
packed the place,

00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:09.150
which could hold an
audience of nearly 4,000.

00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:14.334
And this was the old Met on
Broadway between 39th and 40th.

00:37:14.334 --> 00:37:16.250
The Metropolitan Opera
House at Lincoln Center

00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:19.620
didn't open until 1966,
and when that happened,

00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:22.570
this building was torn down.

00:37:22.570 --> 00:37:26.070
In 1943, the same year
as Anderson's first solo

00:37:26.070 --> 00:37:28.830
concert on the Met
stage, Howard Taubman

00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:31.840
published a book for fans
of classical music titled,

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:36.300
Music on My Beat: An
Intimate Volume of Shop Talk.

00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:40.240
In chapter 15, titled
"The Negro in Music,"

00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:44.290
Taubman let loose, articulating
racial realities that were not

00:37:44.290 --> 00:37:46.010
otherwise being
widely acknowledged

00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:48.004
among white readers
and audiences.

00:37:48.004 --> 00:37:52.400
"How can we expect a hospitable
approach to the Negro musician

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:55.450
from the Metropolitan Opera
House when some of its patrons

00:37:55.450 --> 00:37:57.570
will not even tolerate
the presence of a Negro

00:37:57.570 --> 00:37:59.320
in an adjacent seat?

00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:01.520
At a recent opening
at the Metropolitan,

00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:04.430
several Negroes, dressed
in white tie and tails

00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:07.940
like the other customers,
occupied $10 seats.

00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:10.420
Some subscribers whose
seats adjoined those held

00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:12.310
by the Negroes were annoyed.

00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:13.890
They complained
to the box office,

00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:15.765
which explained that
the seats were purchased

00:38:15.765 --> 00:38:18.090
through speculators,
for the box office

00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:21.030
has to be tender about the
prejudices of its quality

00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:22.870
trade.

00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:26.520
If Negro customers buy tickets
directly from the box office,

00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:29.290
precautions are taken
to give them aisle seats

00:38:29.290 --> 00:38:31.800
and to tear up the ticket
for the adjoining seat,

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:33.270
so that no white
patron will have

00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:35.740
to rub shoulders with a Negro.

00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:38.770
Even when business is good,
this practice is followed.

00:38:38.770 --> 00:38:41.440
An opera official
explained with a long face

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:44.630
that the sacrifice
had to be made."

00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:47.870
Taubman continued, "but
with unchanging bigotries

00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:50.000
in the paying
customers, how can we

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.320
expect essentially
conservative institutions

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:55.010
like the Metropolitan Opera,
or the New York Philharmonic

00:38:55.010 --> 00:38:57.240
Symphony Orchestra,
to invite Negroes

00:38:57.240 --> 00:39:01.670
who become members of singing
or playing personnel?"

00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:03.680
Taubman later was
the ghost writer

00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:06.950
for Anderson's autobiography,
My Lord, What a Morning,

00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:10.240
which appeared in 1956.

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:12.480
Anderson's campaign
at the Met continued,

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:17.160
and she was back on stage
in 1945 and 1946, again

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:20.630
with concerts on Sunday
afternoons in April.

00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:24.050
Then in 1947, Hurok
landed the booking

00:39:24.050 --> 00:39:26.420
he must have been
aiming for all along.

00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:29.110
Not only was Anderson's
rental of the Met in April,

00:39:29.110 --> 00:39:31.530
but it took place
on Easter, which

00:39:31.530 --> 00:39:33.490
then became an annual event.

00:39:33.490 --> 00:39:35.100
It was a brilliant stroke.

00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:37.090
Anderson's triumph at
the Lincoln Memorial had,

00:39:37.090 --> 00:39:39.270
of course, occurred
on Easter Sunday.

00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:41.160
And her standing room
concerts at the Met

00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:43.100
identified her
even more intensely

00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:46.770
with a symbolism of that
day, with hope and renewal,

00:39:46.770 --> 00:39:50.040
with the possibility of
triumphing over tragedy,

00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:53.150
with Christian goodness.

00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:54.770
Most of those
attending the concert

00:39:54.770 --> 00:39:57.630
were members of her own race,
New York's Amsterdam News,

00:39:57.630 --> 00:40:01.100
a black newspaper observed
after Anderson's Easter concert

00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:02.655
in 1947.

00:40:02.655 --> 00:40:06.625
"Mr. Hurok's office informed
me," the reporter continued,

00:40:06.625 --> 00:40:09.120
"that advertisement
had purposely

00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:10.770
been released in
the Negro papers

00:40:10.770 --> 00:40:15.340
first so no one could say there
was partiality of any kind."

00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:17.870
Anderson also presented
Easter concerts at the Met

00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:20.830
in 1948 and 1949.

00:40:20.830 --> 00:40:24.310
Then in May, 1950, she
sailed on the Queen Elizabeth

00:40:24.310 --> 00:40:27.210
for a concert tour of
Europe and South America.

00:40:27.210 --> 00:40:30.490
And Rudolf Bing, the recently
appointed General Director

00:40:30.490 --> 00:40:34.220
of the Metropolitan Opera
Company, was on board as well.

00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:37.290
That same year, Anderson
made another strategic move,

00:40:37.290 --> 00:40:39.660
releasing her first
recording of opera duets

00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:43.870
together with Jan Pearce,
a tenor at the Met.

00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:46.240
Rudolph Bing's appointment
made a difference,

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:49.900
as did the leadership of Max
Rudolf, the Met's conductor

00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:50.860
at the time.

00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:52.630
Both were European.

00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:55.540
Bing was Viennese born
and a British national,

00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:58.270
while Rudolf had
emigrated from Germany.

00:40:58.270 --> 00:41:02.150
In 1951, the Met's color
line started to waver,

00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:05.200
even as an incremental
campaign intensified

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:08.130
to remake the company
into a desegregated

00:41:08.130 --> 00:41:09.915
artistic and social space.

00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:16.050
On January 21st, Duke
Ellington and his orchestra

00:41:16.050 --> 00:41:19.460
presented a benefit concert
for the NAACP at the Met

00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:22.560
with a strategically chosen
group of prominent supporters.

00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:26.530
Once again, gifted performers
of color occupied the hall.

00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:29.980
Mrs. Vincent Impellitteri, wife
of the mayor of New York City,

00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:31.500
served as hostess.

00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:35.270
And Marian Anderson was
one of the chairwomen.

00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:38.880
In March, Fred Thomas,
a young black baritone,

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:40.920
from Norristown,
Pennsylvania, was

00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:44.290
among three winners of the
Metropolitan Opera's Auditions

00:41:44.290 --> 00:41:48.030
of the Air, a contest
with 700 entrants.

00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:50.060
And around the same
time, a reporter

00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:52.595
from the American Negro
Press sent questions

00:41:52.595 --> 00:41:56.760
to the Met's popular opera quiz,
asking when the company would

00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:59.560
hire a black artist.

00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:01.700
In October, a
significant breakthrough

00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:04.780
occurred when the Met signed
the African-American ballerina

00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:07.920
Janet Collins as one of
its two premiere dancers.

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:10.490
The Pittsburgh Courier,
a black newspaper,

00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:14.140
declared that "a long and
bitter fight has been carried on

00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:17.140
for over 10 years for such
an opportunity in the world's

00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:19.830
most famous opera house."

00:42:19.830 --> 00:42:22.795
In November, the New
York Post reported,

00:42:22.795 --> 00:42:25.530
"for the first time in the
history of the Metropolitan

00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:28.830
Opera House's dressy
openings, Negroes

00:42:28.830 --> 00:42:32.150
were admitted last night to
the swanky Sherry's Bar, where

00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:36.400
society and cafe society
relax at intermissions.

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:39.200
Marian Anderson, the famous
singer, was one of the Negroes

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:42.270
served, but not the first."

00:42:42.270 --> 00:42:44.560
That same month,
four black singers

00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:47.280
appeared in the chorus
of Cavalleria rusticana,

00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:50.620
thus managing to quote,
"break the Aida pattern,"

00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:54.975
as another black paper,
the Atlanta Daily World.

00:42:54.975 --> 00:42:58.540
"To date, Aida has been
the only operatic vehicle

00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:01.170
in which most Negro
singers were featured,"

00:43:01.170 --> 00:43:03.440
the article continued.

00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:07.960
In 1953, Robert McFerrin became
the first African American

00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:11.450
to win the Metropolitan
Opera of the Air Auditions.

00:43:11.450 --> 00:43:15.545
Then in 1954, Sylvia Olden
Lee became the first African

00:43:15.545 --> 00:43:17.710
American on the Met staff.

00:43:17.710 --> 00:43:20.260
A brilliant pianist
and vocal coach,

00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:23.680
Lee became the coach to multiple
generations of Met singers,

00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:26.220
including Shirley
Verrett, Kathleen Battle,

00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:28.530
and Jessye Norman.

00:43:28.530 --> 00:43:31.420
The biggest breakthrough of
all occurred that October

00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:34.120
when Bing signed Anderson
to appear with the Met

00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:36.160
the following January.

00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:39.070
Anderson noted in an interview
that the Supreme Court

00:43:39.070 --> 00:43:41.710
ruling in Brown v.
Board of Education

00:43:41.710 --> 00:43:43.680
had taken place that May.

00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:46.410
And quote, "it gives
the feeling that they

00:43:46.410 --> 00:43:51.520
are beginning to understand,
to know that you're there."

00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:56.680
Anderson's actual debut
on January 7th, 1955,

00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:59.690
was a major cultural event,
with heavy attendance

00:43:59.690 --> 00:44:01.780
by African Americans,
including many

00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:04.025
who had traveled from
all over the country.

00:44:04.025 --> 00:44:07.830
"Hired Cadillacs deposited
parties from Harlem,"

00:44:07.830 --> 00:44:09.790
declared the
Associated Negro Press.

00:44:09.790 --> 00:44:12.040
"And it was sheer
delight to see parties

00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:16.170
of lovely teenage girls
chaperoned by their elders

00:44:16.170 --> 00:44:17.760
taking their seats."

00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:20.530
Plus, two porters at the
Met purchased tickets

00:44:20.530 --> 00:44:23.080
and proudly entered as guests.

00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:26.150
Prominent figures turned out,
including Langston Hughes

00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:28.550
and an impressive array
of black vocalists,

00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:31.950
Roland Hayes, Eva Jessye,
conducted the chorus

00:44:31.950 --> 00:44:34.640
of the original Porgy and
Bess, Mattiwilda Dobbs,

00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:38.590
who was the first black singer
to debut at La Scala, Leontyne

00:44:38.590 --> 00:44:41.690
Price, and Camilla Williams
and Lawrence Winters,

00:44:41.690 --> 00:44:45.130
who were then featured artists
with the New York City Opera.

00:44:45.130 --> 00:44:48.150
Founded in 1943, the
New York City Opera

00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:52.240
had broken the
color line in 1946.

00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:55.220
Here is an excerpt of Marian
Anderson and the recording

00:44:55.220 --> 00:44:58.419
of Masked Ball, made
immediately after her premiere.

00:44:58.419 --> 00:45:00.460
[MUSIC PLAYING - MARIAN
 ANDERSON, "MASKED BALL"]

00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:03.310
-[SINGING IN ITALIAN]

00:45:15.590 --> 00:45:20.000
-While it is tempting to end
this tale on a triumphal note,

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.250
which has frequently been the
case in historical narratives,

00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:25.510
the sobering reality
is that Anderson

00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:28.810
was asked to play a character
rife with longstanding racial

00:45:28.810 --> 00:45:31.190
stereotypes and ties
to the tradition

00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:33.290
of blackface minstrelsy.

00:45:33.290 --> 00:45:36.540
Her role was that of Ulrica
in Verdi's Masked Ball,

00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:39.000
an opera seldom
performed at the time.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.710
When the opera was composed
in the mid-19th century,

00:45:41.710 --> 00:45:43.150
the original
location of the plot

00:45:43.150 --> 00:45:46.880
was changed from Sweden
to colonial Boston.

00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:49.530
In a recent article, one
scholar of Italian history

00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:51.650
has called the
revised opera, quote,

00:45:51.650 --> 00:45:54.940
"a remarkably painful
theatrical representation

00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:57.320
of life in the New World."

00:45:57.320 --> 00:45:59.750
There, Ulrica Rieger is
described in the libretto

00:45:59.750 --> 00:46:03.450
as possessing, quote, "the
foul blood of the Negroes."

00:46:03.450 --> 00:46:06.460
In the 19th century, Ulrica
played by a white singer

00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:09.930
in blackface, even as Harriet
Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's

00:46:09.930 --> 00:46:13.930
Cabin generated considerable
discussion in Italy.

00:46:13.930 --> 00:46:16.160
While Ulrica sings in
only one scene which

00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:19.440
takes place in Act One,
when Marian Anderson

00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:23.210
took the stage she was
attired in a long, black wig,

00:46:23.210 --> 00:46:25.960
waved a skull and
crossbones, and stirred

00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:27.570
an immense cauldron.

00:46:27.570 --> 00:46:30.440
She was a fearful character,
one observer noted.

00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:33.560
Another commented on the
contrast to the evening gowns

00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:36.310
she wears in recitals.

00:46:36.310 --> 00:46:38.690
Only a few cultural
critics at the time

00:46:38.690 --> 00:46:42.580
connected the dots between
the exotic othering of Ulrica

00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:44.690
and that of Marian Anderson.

00:46:44.690 --> 00:46:48.140
The notion of colorblind
casting as we conceive it today

00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:49.550
barely existed.

00:46:49.550 --> 00:46:52.290
And the practices of
blackface were alive and well

00:46:52.290 --> 00:46:54.130
on stage and screen.

00:46:54.130 --> 00:46:56.310
Among those alert to
racial representation

00:46:56.310 --> 00:46:59.460
was Dean Gordon Hancock of
the American Negro Press

00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:02.550
who wrote an article immediately
after Anderson's premiere

00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:06.086
highlighting the implications
of what had transpired.

00:47:06.086 --> 00:47:09.820
"It is interesting to note
here that this opera originally

00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:13.140
called for a Negro as
Ulrica, and in addition,

00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:14.780
gives some conception
of the light

00:47:14.780 --> 00:47:18.680
in which the Negro race was
held in Italy prior to 1859.

00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:20.895
For the judge in
addressing Ricardo, says,

00:47:20.895 --> 00:47:25.610
'Ulrica, she is of the vile
race of Negroes.'" Hancock

00:47:25.610 --> 00:47:26.110
continued.

00:47:26.110 --> 00:47:27.526
Of course, she
says it in Italian,

00:47:27.526 --> 00:47:30.622
which in New York City, maybe
people didn't notice as much.

00:47:30.622 --> 00:47:33.390
"Curiously, Anderson
was playing two roles,

00:47:33.390 --> 00:47:36.870
a member of the vile race of
Negroes, and an arch pioneer

00:47:36.870 --> 00:47:40.240
in finally bringing democracy
to an operatic institution

00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:43.790
of which all Americans
should be unanimously proud."

00:47:43.790 --> 00:47:45.800
Anderson performed
Ulrica six times

00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:48.150
on the stage of the old
Metropolitan Opera House,

00:47:48.150 --> 00:47:50.650
and two of those performances
were featured in the company's

00:47:50.650 --> 00:47:53.210
radio broadcasts.

00:47:53.210 --> 00:47:55.610
For Anderson, there
was no opportunity

00:47:55.610 --> 00:47:57.260
for a career in opera.

00:47:57.260 --> 00:48:00.050
Rather, she used her celebrity
to crack open a door that

00:48:00.050 --> 00:48:02.320
had previously been unmovable.

00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:05.810
A string of Met debuts followed
by African-American singers,

00:48:05.810 --> 00:48:12.700
including Robert McFerrin in
Aida, on January 27, 1955,

00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:15.540
three weeks after
Anderson's breakthrough,

00:48:15.540 --> 00:48:20.310
Mattiwilda Dobbs, in
Rigoletto in 1956,

00:48:20.310 --> 00:48:23.930
and Gloria Davy in Aida in 1958.

00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:28.580
The Met debut of Leontyne
Price in 1961 in Trovatore

00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:31.180
marked the biggest
advance of all.

00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:33.570
Price became a central
member of the company

00:48:33.570 --> 00:48:38.500
rather than an artist
featured only a few times.

00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:40.250
My research this
year at Radcliffe

00:48:40.250 --> 00:48:42.170
is dedicated to
exploring threads

00:48:42.170 --> 00:48:45.150
of this sort in the history
of racial desegregation

00:48:45.150 --> 00:48:46.680
in American performance.

00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:49.300
And I want to conclude today
by looping back to the press

00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:52.450
release about the new $5 bill,
which used the term "opera

00:48:52.450 --> 00:48:55.140
singer," and also to
Newsweek's recent question,

00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:57.170
"who is Marian Anderson?"

00:48:57.170 --> 00:48:59.660
With the press release, the
Secretary of the Treasury

00:48:59.660 --> 00:49:02.940
must have deployed "opera"
for its cultural cache,

00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:07.070
intending it as a complement
to Anderson, as a validation.

00:49:07.070 --> 00:49:09.310
Yet given the pernicious
exclusion of her

00:49:09.310 --> 00:49:12.790
from opera stages, it's
poignant if not painful

00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:15.340
to associate her with the
status that she was, in fact,

00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:17.910
prevented from achieving.

00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:21.300
Meanwhile, Newsweek's headline
exposes the enormous gaps

00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:24.790
in historical memory about
on the ground realities

00:49:24.790 --> 00:49:27.620
of racial segregation
and about the spectrum

00:49:27.620 --> 00:49:30.800
of figures who played a role
in the Civil Rights Movement.

00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:33.660
To move forward as a
multiracial citizenry,

00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:34.890
we need to do better.

00:49:34.890 --> 00:49:36.426
Thank you.

00:49:36.426 --> 00:49:37.680
