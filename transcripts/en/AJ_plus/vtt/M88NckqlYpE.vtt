00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.120
Proposed legislation in Congress would make it

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.140
even though that is their 
constitutionally protected right.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.080
For years, Congress has tried to pass laws that would

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:24.660
a top priority for the pro-Israel lobby and major donors to both Democrats and Republicans.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.700
These laws would make it

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.820
on political grounds

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.180
They portray the

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.880
or BDS, as a

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.280
There's only one word for it.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.420
Well, I'm not aware of instances in history where there has been an effort

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.480
through federal legislation to attempt to

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.300
which are of course

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.000
BDS is a movement calling on supporters to

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.000
to demand Palestinian rights.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.340
In early 2019, the previously introduced Combatting BDS Act failed to advance in Congress.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:28.240
This bill would have given state and local governments the power to boycott any businesses that boycott Israel.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.820
It's also being pushed forward by the

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:37.300
pro-Israel lobby, and would work to legally strengthen already existing anti-BDS laws at the state level.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.000
This comes after Congress failed to pass the Israel Anti-Boycott Act

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.940
as part of a spending bill before the end of its term in 2018.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.160
There's some powerful forces who just want to throw it into the bill

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.100
and that force it through without 
fuller reflection from the body.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.800
Faiz Shaker, of the American Civil Liberties Union, says the proposed legislation violates Americans

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.634
constitutionally protected freedom of speech.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.140
He believes many members of Congress are unaware of the constitutional implications of this legislation

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.420
The Israel Anti-Boycott Act

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.300
specifically calling out boycotts against Israel.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.560
For the ACLU, that's a huge issue.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.080
merely because somebody has a viewpoint that they don't like.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.020
And once you go down that road, of course,

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:40.260
Yousef Munayyer, of the U.S. Campaign for Palestinian Rights, says these laws are

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:47.660
specifically directed at groups like his. "The basic point of this act and the supporters of the legislation

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.120
are on record saying this,

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.640
which has adopted, of course, boycott, divestment and sanctions tactics."

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.920
BDS has already scored some notable successes.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.659
Celebrities like Danny Glover and Naomi Klein have publicly called for boycott of Israel.

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:13.380
I support BDS and I've supported BDS since 2009.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.180
The question is what do you do when a

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.640
when a people under illegal occupation

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:26.380
come together and chart out a way for the rest of the world to express their solidarity and support them.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.260
Even church groups like Presbyterian Church USA,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.140
the United Church of Christ and others have announced divestment from Israel.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:41.460
Israel's supporters are seeking to shut down the movement as support grows for citizen action like BDS.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:48.820
Today, 26 states have passed anti-BDS laws, with 13 additional states considering similar measures as well.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.220
But in two separate court cases, federal judges in Kansas and Arizona ruled that state laws

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.600
punishing individuals or companies for partaking in BDS

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.380
and violated free speech rights.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:03.600
Meanwhile, the

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.460
would force the U.S. Department of Education to treat criticism of Israel as anti-Semitic harassment.

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.140
In other words, a violation of the Civil Rights Act.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.880
The problem of legislating on it is you're casting too wide a net, and

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.020
that really isn't anti-Semitism.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.220
It's merely a difference of a point of view on a policy area.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.660
This would effectively stifle the speech of Palestinian rights

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.920
advocacy groups like Munayyer's organization

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:38.240
and ironically would use anti-Semitism as grounds to silence even Jewish critics of Israel,

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.880
like Jewish Voice for Peace and IfNotNow.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.460
Here's Jewish academic Judith Butler of Jewish Voice for Peace, on BDS.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.800
that it is a support for

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.560
But I think because, you know, the state of Israel

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.640
has also gone to great lengths

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.140
to conflate Judaism and Zionism,

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:13.740
there is an understanding in our discourse that somehow these things are more tied than they are in reality.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.320
The First Amendment prevents Congress from making laws that limit free speech.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.980
And the ACLU has publicly

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.640
criticized these pieces of legislation for undermining constitutional values.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:31.000
The legal fight is, of course, over whether you can impose a criminal fine or a civil fine

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.500
merely because somebody has a viewpoint that you don't like, and the answer

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.680
on that is, obviously, you cannot.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.780
So what happens if these pieces of legislation are passed and become law?

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.940
Let's start with the Israel Anti-Boycott Act.

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:50.100
This law is actually an amendment of the 1979 Export Administration Act,

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.280
which prohibited U.S. citizens and companies from boycotting friendly nations.

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:58.840
U.S. citizens would also be unable to request any information about companies

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.140
that conduct business relations with Israel and

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:06.220
wouldn't even be allowed to notify the UN if it's unknowingly doing business with Israel.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.900
So, the legal consequences are broad. It could be really anything. The things that I fear here

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.320
is that a federal government passes Anti-Israel Boycott Act,

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.820
and what may happen is that

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.520
federal prosecutors throughout America now have

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.280
Under this proposed law, both individuals and companies could face financial

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:36.000
penalties for supporting EU or UN backed boycotts of Israel,

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.760
Israeli companies and specifically those in the occupied West Bank.

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:47.540
The point here is to intimidate rights activists for engaging in constitutionally protected activity

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.640
Violations of the law could see U.S. citizens

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.740
Willful violations of the law could see citizens

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:05.020
And then there's the

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:10.820
which the ACLU and other activist organizations have issued statements opposing.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:18.760
This is legislation that would actually call on the Department of Education to adopt a particular

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:26.060
definition of anti-Semitism, or a particular understanding of anti-Semitism, which it should take into consideration

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:31.760
as it looks at civil rights discrimination complaints.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:34.820
This bill would work to silence critics and criticism of Israel in

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:42.940
And institutions of learning would also work to ensure that their campuses are spaces where criticism of Israel

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:49.400
violating their free speech rights to avoid investigations by the Department of Education.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.380
So a student protester who's on a listserv

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:57.680
having a debate about Palestinian issues could easily be castigated

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:03.640
for having engaged in anti-Semitism and then fear the wrath of a federal agency.

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:09.120
This could result in numerous lawsuits and court cases in which activists and educational institutions

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:13.120
sue the government for violations of their free speech and civil rights.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.460
And so, what gets unleashed here is potentially

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:20.040
prosecutors who use this power in very unfortunate ways,

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:24.900
but the other ramification, as you well know, is that culturally it suggests something

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.400
to all Americans about what will not be tolerated.

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:33.420
And that is of course this chilling of speech that we worry gravely about.

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:38.160
But despite the possibility of these pieces of legislation becoming law,

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:41.840
two U.S. congresswomen have stated their support for BDS.

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:46.900
Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan have come out in support of BDS.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:52.280
Talib is saying she'll lead a congressional delegation to the occupied West Bank in 2019.

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:54.260
And that would be a first.

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:55.380
Munayyer says this is

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:01.980
When you look at public opinion seeing a shift on this issue as well, and

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:04.280
primarily the Republican base of white

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:08.380
Evangelicals being hyper-supportive of Israel,

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:11.080
and the base of the Democratic Party, in particular,

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:15.022
millennials and people of color being much, much more critical of

00:09:15.022 --> 00:09:18.660
Israeli policy and supportive of the rights of Palestinians.

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:22.647
But Munayyer is still concerned about the legislation potentially being passed

00:09:22.647 --> 00:09:26.600
and what that will mean for free speech and organizing around Palestine.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.100
including people who are working on

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:35.760
they have even more reason to be concerned about

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:39.380
very much,
