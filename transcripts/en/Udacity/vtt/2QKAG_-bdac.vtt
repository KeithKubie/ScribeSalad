00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.190
Now unless you're one of the first students to make it

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.410
through this class there are probably a lot of, responses in that

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:08.410
thread. And in this question you're really going to take advantage

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.500
of the form. And the way your going to do that, well, let's

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.740
write it as a flow. First your going to find somebody elses

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.670
response to the previous question. But when you do this make sure

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.630
that you don't read the review or anything but the name

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.580
of the app to begin with. Because the second step is to

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.510
form your own opinion about this app. What do

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.410
you like about it? What do you dislike? What would

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.750
you change? Once you figure these answers out for yourself,

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.480
you can go on to step three, which is actually

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.100
to take a look at the other students' prezi. You'll

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.620
learn what they didn't like about this particular app and

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.860
how they would fix it. Finally, you'll respond. Just in

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.890
that same thread, you'll respond to the post that this

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.130
other student has made. And this is the part where you have to make sure to be

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:59.080
productive. Nobody's wrong in these situations, different people like

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.500
different things. In fact, in the next lesson, we're

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.379
going to learn that even though good or good

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.170
can differ between users. We still have systems and

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.410
techniques that we can use to insure the products

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.890
we build will be good for our intended audience.
