00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.900
So the error suggests that the system or the

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.689
program, it can not find the file specified. You

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:10.100
know, that's really interesting because at one point we

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.520
were able to find all of the files. In fact

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.520
we printed out all of the file names. Okay,

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.830
let's continue to read the error. It says that the

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.025
error is in line 9, and it's happening around

00:00:21.025 --> 00:00:25.650
os.rename. This makes me wonder if the program is actually

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.560
looking at the right folder when it's trying to rename the files. So going back

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.090
to our program, I know there is this function called os.getcwd.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.150
CWD stands for Current Working Directory. Let me save that in a variable

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.030
and print it. And I will comment everything else out for the time being.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.080
Let me Save, and Run.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.240
It seems that the programs Current Working Directory is

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.200
this folder called OOP, which resides in the C drive.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.750
And if I go back to my program, I know

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.700
that my files or my photos are inside this folder

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.680
called prank, which is inside OOP which resides in the

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.780
C drive. No wonder the program can't find any of

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.470
the files. It's looking inside OOP. Meanwhile, all of the

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.450
files are inside prank. To fix this, I can use

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.910
the change directory function. And with this function I can

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.410
ask the program to look at the folder where my

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.900
files actually reside, which is this folder right here. So

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.440
I'm going to copy that, and I'm going to paste it here.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.760
And then let me uncomment some of the lines

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.590
I'd commented out before. Towards the end of the function,

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.030
I will change the path back to how I found

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.560
it. Let me Save, and Run the program one more

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.830
time. Hm, the program didn't quite throw an error

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.340
this time. But now I want to check to see if

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.570
the files have actually been renamed. So here we are

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.130
back at our folder, and you'll notice that the names

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.810
of the files don't have any numbers any more.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.080
They've been renamed. And if I zoom out a

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.540
little bit, you'll notice that the photos will reveal

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.788
a secret message, which is that the keys are

00:02:09.788 --> 00:02:14.820
in the closet behind the shoebox. All right, it

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.510
seemed like our program worked. Now, before we finish

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.630
this project, my final recommendation in terms of improving

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.390
it, is to add a print statement each time

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.430
we change the name of a file. So here I am printing

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.474
the old name of the file, and here is its new name.
