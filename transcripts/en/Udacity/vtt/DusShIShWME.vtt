00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.890
Let us look at how the process of configuration would work in detail.

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.650
Recorder will met a file of represent in reason, will represent knowledge and

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.890
then reason over it. So suppose it asked the configure a chair. We must then

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.490
somehow represent all of the knowledge of this chair then we can reason over it.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.040
So we will represent all of our knowledge of the chair in the form of a frame.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.100
Here's is the frame, here are the beta slots. For the time being,

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.922
let's just assume that there are six slots that are important. The last four of

00:00:25.922 --> 00:00:30.150
the slots may point to their own frames. So there might be a frame for legs,

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.730
a frame for seat, and so on. Now some of these frames have slots like size, and

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.330
material, and cost. For legs, you may have an additional slot like count.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.830
What is the number of legs on the chair? And this particular frame

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:47.590
representation captures of the knowledge of the generic, prototypical chair.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.700
To do configuration design is to come up with a specific arrangement of all

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.860
the parts to this particular chair, to assign values to each of the variables,

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.300
which means filling out the fillers for each of the slots. Of course, the values

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.370
of these variables depends in part on the global constraints of mass and

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.890
cost. We may, for example, have a global constraint on the mass of the chair, or

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.710
in the cost of the chair, or both. We may have additional constraint as well.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.100
For example in material of a chair might become an,

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.610
perhaps the material needs to be metal.
