00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:03.280
Let's say I have some
type of a block here.

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.580
And let's say this
block has a mass of m.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.100
So the mass of this
block is equal to m.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.250
And it's sitting on this-- you
could view this is an inclined

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.500
plane, or a ramp, or
some type of wedge.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.957
And we want to think about what
might happen to this block.

00:00:19.957 --> 00:00:22.290
And we'll start thinking about
the different forces that

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.770
might keep it in place
or not keep it in place

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.270
and all of the rest.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.080
So the one thing we do know
is if this whole set up

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.150
is near the surface
of the Earth--

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.680
and we'll assume that it is
for the sake of this video--

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.530
that there will be the
force of gravity trying

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.782
to bring or attract this
mass towards the center

00:00:42.782 --> 00:00:44.990
of the Earth, and vice versa,
the center of the earth

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.700
towards this mass.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.580
So we're going to have
some force of gravity.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.060
Let me start right at the center
of this mass right over here.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:57.070
And so you're going to
have the force of gravity.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.390
The force due to
gravity is going

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.800
to be equal to the
gravitational field

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.250
near the surface of the Earth.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.940
And so we'll call that g.

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.715
We'll call that
g times the mass.

00:01:10.715 --> 00:01:11.590
Let me just write it.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.920
The mass times the
gravitational field

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.320
near the surface of the Earth.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.010
And it's going to
be downwards, we

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.270
know that, or at least towards
the surface of the Earth.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.570
Now, what else is going
to be happening here?

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.120
Well, it gets a
little bit confusing,

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.540
because you can't really say
that normal force is acting

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.740
directly against this
force right over here.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.190
Because remember,
the normal force

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.750
acts perpendicular to a surface.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.040
So over here, the surface is
not perpendicular to the force

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.680
of gravity.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.330
So we have to think about it a
little bit differently than we

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.100
do if this was sitting
on level ground.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.220
Well, the one thing we can do,
and frankly, that we should do,

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.760
is maybe we can
break up this force,

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.440
the force due to gravity.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.120
We can break it
up into components

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.900
that are either
perpendicular to the surface

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.386
or that are parallel
to the surface.

00:02:02.386 --> 00:02:04.010
And then we can use
those to figure out

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.210
what's likely to happen.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.750
What are potentially the netting
forces, or balancing forces,

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.459
over here?

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:11.750
So let's see if we can do that.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.230
Let's see if we can
break this force vector,

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.010
the force due to gravity,
into a component that

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:23.570
is perpendicular to the
surface of this ramp.

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.180
And also another
component that is parallel

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.110
to the surface of this ramp.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.490
Let me do that in
a different color.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.980
That is parallel to the
surface of this ramp.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.370
And this is a little bit
unconventional notation,

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.960
but I'll call this one over
here the force due to gravity

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.582
that is perpendicular
to the ramp.

00:02:44.582 --> 00:02:47.040
That little upside down t, I'm
saying that's perpendicular.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.480
Because it shows a line
that's perpendicular to,

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.020
I guess, this bottom line, this
horizontal line over there.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.540
And this blue thing
over here, I'm

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.690
going to call this
the part of force

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.500
due to gravity that is parallel.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.090
I'm just doing these
two upward vertical bars

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.686
to show something that is
parallel to the surface.

00:03:07.686 --> 00:03:09.060
So this is the
component of force

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.976
due to gravity that's
perpendicular, component

00:03:10.976 --> 00:03:12.880
of force that is parallel.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.580
So let's see if we
can use a little bit

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.070
a geometry and
trigonometry, given

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:24.080
that this wedge is at
a theta degree incline

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.220
relative to the horizontal.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.580
If you were to measure
this angle right over here,

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:28.630
you would get theta.

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.770
So in future videos we'll
make it more concrete,

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.399
like 30 degrees or 45
degrees or whatever.

00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:34.690
But let's just keep in general.

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.560
If this is theta,
let's figure out

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.600
what these components of
the gravitational force

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.920
are going to be.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.680
Well, we can break out
our geometry over here.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.780
This, I'm assuming
is a right angle.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.560
And so if this is
a right angle, we

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.540
know that the sum of the angles
in a triangle add up to 180.

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.990
So if this angle, and this
90 degrees-- right angle

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.640
says 90 degrees-- add
up to 180, then that

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.230
means that this one and this one
need to add up to 90 degrees.

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.360
Or, if this is theta,
this angle right over here

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.006
is going to be 90 minus theta.

00:04:17.006 --> 00:04:18.839
Now, the other thing
that you may or may not

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:20.980
remember from geometry
class is that if I

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:28.175
have two parallel lines,
and I have a transversal.

00:04:28.175 --> 00:04:31.550
So I'm going to assume this
line is parallel to this line.

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.600
And then I have a transversal.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.810
So let's say I have a
line that goes like this.

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.340
We know from basic
geometry that this angle

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.520
is going to be
equal to this angle.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.650
It comes from alternate
interior angles.

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.770
And we prove it in
the geometry module,

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.060
or in the geometry videos.

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.820
But hopefully this makes a
little bit of intuitive sense,

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.028
and you could even think
about how these angles would

00:04:53.028 --> 00:04:55.560
changes as the transversal
changes, and all of the rest.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.270
But the parallel
lines makes this angle

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.010
similar to that angle, or
actually makes it identical,

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:01.210
makes it congruent.

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.910
This angle is going to be the
same measure as that angle.

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.355
So can we apply that
anywhere over here?

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.050
This line is perpendicular
to the surface of the Earth.

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.240
Right over here that I'm
kind of shading in blue.

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.790
And so is this force vector.

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:22.660
It is also perpendicular to
the surface of the Earth.

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.640
So this line over here and
this line over here in magenta

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.100
are going to be parallel.

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.040
I can even draw that.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.491
That line and that
line are both parallel.

00:05:33.491 --> 00:05:34.990
When you look at
it that way, you'll

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.740
see that this big line over here
can be viewed as a transversal.

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.150
Or you could have this
angle and this angle

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:43.880
are going to be congruent.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.910
They're going to be
alternate interior angles.

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:50.134
So this angle and this angle,
by the exact same idea here.

00:05:50.134 --> 00:05:52.050
It just looks a little
bit more confusing here

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.660
because I have all
sorts of things.

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.390
But this line and this
line are parallel.

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:59.700
You can view this right
over here as a transversal.

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.190
So this and this are
congruent angles.

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.460
So this is 90 minus
theta degrees.

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.130
This too will be 90
minus theta degrees.

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:11.660
90 minus theta degrees.

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.310
Now, given that, can we
figure out this angle?

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:18.400
Well one thing, we're assuming
that this yellow force vector

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.430
right here is perpendicular
to the surface of this plane

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:25.090
or perpendicular to the
surface of this ramp.

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:26.660
So that's perpendicular.

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:29.260
This right here
is 90 minus theta.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.670
So what is this angle up
here going to be equal to?

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:35.570
This angle, let
me do it in green.

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:38.590
What is this angle up
here going to be equal to?

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:42.180
So this angle plus 90
minus theta plus 90

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:47.760
must be equal to 180, or this
angle plus 90 minus theta must

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.600
be equal to-- let
me write this down.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.308
I don't want to do
too much in your head.

00:06:51.308 --> 00:06:52.110
So let's call it x.

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:56.672
So x plus 90 minus theta.

00:06:56.672 --> 00:07:00.280
Plus this 90 degrees right over
here, plus this 90 degrees,

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:04.220
needs to be equal
to 180 degrees.

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:07.470
Let's see, we can subtract
180 degrees from both sides.

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:10.690
So we subtract 90 twice,
you subtract 180 degrees

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:13.820
and you get x minus
theta is equal to 0,

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:16.380
or x is equal to theta.

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:19.620
So whatever the inclination of
the plane is or of this ramp,

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:22.940
that is also going to be
this angle right over here.

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.070
And the value to
that is that now we

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:28.010
can use our basic
trigonometry to figure out

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:30.470
this component
and this component

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:31.929
of the force of gravity.

00:07:31.929 --> 00:07:33.470
And to see that a
little bit clearer,

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:36.890
let me shift this force
vector down over here.

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:39.610
The parallel component,
let me shift it over here.

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:41.520
And you can see the
perpendicular component

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.960
plus the parallel component
is equal to the total force

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.390
due to gravity.

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:49.140
And you should also see that
this is a right triangle

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:51.320
that I have set up over here.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.770
This is parallel to the plane.

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:54.930
This is perpendicular
to the plane.

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:56.620
And so we can use
basic trigonometry

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:59.610
to figure out the magnitudes
of the perpendicular

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:03.964
force due to gravity and the
parallel force due to gravity.

00:08:03.964 --> 00:08:05.380
Let's think about
it a little bit.

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:08.880
I'll do it over here.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.630
The magnitude of
the perpendicular

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:14.040
force due to gravity.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.950
Or I should say the
component of gravity

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:19.434
that's perpendicular to
the ramp, the magnitude

00:08:19.434 --> 00:08:21.100
of that vector-- a
lot of fancy notation

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:25.270
but it's really just the length
of this vector right over here.

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:29.560
So the magnitude of
this over the hypotenuse

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:30.600
of this right triangle.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.809
Well, what the hypotenuse
of this right triangle?

00:08:32.809 --> 00:08:34.308
Well, it's going
to be the magnitude

00:08:34.308 --> 00:08:40.309
of the total
gravitational force.

00:08:40.309 --> 00:08:41.690
I guess you could say that.

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:46.870
And so you could say that is mg.

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:48.770
We could write it like this.

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:52.250
But that's really-- well,
I could write it like that.

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:54.010
And so this is going
to be equal to what?

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:56.350
We have the, if we're looking
at this angle right here,

00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:59.950
we have the adjacent
over the hypotenuse.

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:01.240
Remember.

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.796
We can do this in a new color.

00:09:02.796 --> 00:09:05.130
We can do this in a new color.

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:08.490
SOH CAH TOA.

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:11.230
Cosine is adjacent
over hypotenuse.

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:14.580
So this is equal to
cosine of the angle.

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:18.240
So cosine of theta is
equal to the adjacent

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.230
over the hypotenuse.

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:22.350
So if you multiply both
sides by the magnitude

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:26.630
of the hypotenuse, you get the
component of our vector that

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:30.240
is perpendicular to the
surface of the plane

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:38.870
is equal to the magnitude
of the force due to gravity

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:41.020
times the cosine of theta.

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:42.720
Times the cosine of theta.

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.272
We'll apply this
in the next video

00:09:44.272 --> 00:09:46.480
just so you can make the
numbers a lot more concrete.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:48.438
Sometimes just the notation
makes it confusing.

00:09:48.438 --> 00:09:50.970
You'll see it's really actually
pretty straightforward.

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:54.520
And then this second thing,
we can use the same logic.

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:57.120
If we think about the parallel
vector right over here,

00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:02.490
the magnitude of the
component of the force

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:05.320
due to gravity that is
parallel to the plane

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:08.550
over the magnitude of the
force due to gravity--

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:13.230
which is the
magnitude of mg-- that

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:16.910
is going to be equal to what?

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:20.160
This is the opposite
side to the angle.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.720
So the blue stuff is the
opposite side, or at least

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:25.270
its length, is the
opposite side of the angle.

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:27.670
And then right over
here this magnitude

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:29.200
of mg, that is the hypotenuse.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.260
So you have the opposite
over the hypotenuse.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:32.790
Opposite over hypotenuse.

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:35.090
Sine of an angle is
opposite over hypotenuse.

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:39.090
So this is going to be
equal to the sine of theta.

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:41.490
This is equal to
the sine of theta.

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:46.600
Or you multiply both sides
times the magnitude of the force

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:49.590
due to gravity and
you get the component

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:57.550
of the force due to gravity
that is parallel to the ramp

00:10:57.550 --> 00:11:07.260
is going to be the force
due to gravity total times

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:08.810
sine of theta.

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:11.480
Times sine of theta.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:13.950
And hopefully you should
see where this came from.

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:17.640
Because if you ever have to
derive this again 30 years

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:21.880
after you took a physics class,
you should be able to do it.

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:27.830
But if you know this right
here, and this right here,

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:30.220
we can all of a sudden start
breaking down the forces

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:32.129
into things that
are useful to us.

00:11:32.129 --> 00:11:33.670
Because we could
say, hey, look, this

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:35.410
isn't moving down
into this plane.

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:36.930
So maybe there's
some normal force

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:39.750
that's completely netting
it out in this example.

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:41.882
And maybe if there's
nothing to keep it up,

00:11:41.882 --> 00:11:43.590
and there's no friction,
maybe this thing

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:45.850
will start accelerating
due to the parallel force.

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:47.510
And we'll think a
lot more about that.

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:50.112
And if you ever forget these,
think about them intuitively.

00:11:50.112 --> 00:11:52.320
You don't have to go through
this whole parallel line

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.700
and transversal and all of that.

00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:59.650
If this angle went
down to 0, then we'll

00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:01.680
be talking about
essentially a flat surface.

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.720
There is no inclination there.

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:06.830
And if this angle goes down
to 0, then all of the force

00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:11.250
should be acting perpendicular
to the surface of the plane.

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:14.690
So if this going to 0, if
the perpendicular force

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:17.810
should be the same thing as
the total gravitational force.

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:19.310
And that's why it's
cosine of theta.

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:21.680
Because cosine of
0 right now is 1.

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.590
And so these would
equal each other.

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:26.450
And if this is equal to 0,
then the parallel component

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:27.960
of gravity should go to 0.

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.540
Because gravity
will only be acting

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:32.890
downwards, and once again,
if sine of theta is 0.

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:35.430
So the force of gravity that
is parallel will go to 0.

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:38.060
So if you ever forget, just do
that little intuitive thought

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:40.050
process and you'll
remember which one is sine

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:42.260
and which one is cosine.
