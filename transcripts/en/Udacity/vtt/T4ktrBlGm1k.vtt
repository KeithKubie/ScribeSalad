00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Well, 16.02 - 0.09 is 15.93,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and if we add 0.09, we get 16.11.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Notice that the number 16.00 still falls within this realm,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and so our square relationship that we were looking for before is still entirely possible.

00:00:17.000 --> 99:59:59.000
It's still, as we would say, within our experimental error.
