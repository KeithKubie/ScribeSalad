00:00:09.756 --> 00:00:11.756
&gt;&gt;Student: I got it high.

00:00:11.756 --> 00:00:12.916
&gt;&gt;Eric: Oh yeah, nice.

00:00:13.436 --> 00:00:17.096
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In rural Grants Pass,
Oregon, Eric Epstein uses games

00:00:17.096 --> 00:00:19.326
to teach students at Jerome
Prairie Elementary School,

00:00:19.326 --> 00:00:20.646
better social skills.

00:00:20.846 --> 00:00:25.056
&gt;&gt;Eric: Okay, so first of all, who
remembers something you learned

00:00:25.056 --> 00:00:27.346
from medicine ball,
that helped you succeed?

00:00:27.736 --> 00:00:27.946
Yes?

00:00:28.476 --> 00:00:28.776
&gt;&gt;Student: Teamwork.

00:00:28.976 --> 00:00:29.476
&gt;&gt;Eric: Teamwork, okay.

00:00:29.536 --> 00:00:34.616
&gt;&gt;Your job now is to make a
creature, a living creature

00:00:34.796 --> 00:00:38.266
out of your play dough that
represents you in some way.

00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:39.156
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Epstein works

00:00:39.156 --> 00:00:41.766
for the nonprofit Southern
Oregon Adolescent Study

00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:43.326
and Treatment Center.

00:00:43.326 --> 00:00:45.946
As a school community
advocate, he spends most

00:00:45.946 --> 00:00:47.646
of his week with students.

00:00:47.696 --> 00:00:48.816
&gt;&gt;Student: I made a gorilla as mine.

00:00:49.146 --> 00:00:50.446
&gt;&gt;Eric: So why is the
gorilla like you?

00:00:50.626 --> 00:00:52.106
&gt;&gt;Student: It's big and strong.

00:00:52.106 --> 00:00:52.946
&gt;&gt;Eric: Big and strong.

00:00:53.516 --> 00:00:53.716
Good.

00:00:54.156 --> 00:00:56.356
&gt;&gt;Narrator: A key to the
advocate's success is

00:00:56.356 --> 00:00:58.596
that they avoid the stigma
of formal counseling.

00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:02.546
Running student clubs, they
become magnets for kids

00:01:02.616 --> 00:01:03.876
who need a personal connection.

00:01:03.876 --> 00:01:06.196
&gt;&gt;Eric: How is you guys' day going?

00:01:06.486 --> 00:01:07.156
Are you surviving?

00:01:07.926 --> 00:01:10.186
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Then, having
earned the students' trust,

00:01:10.836 --> 00:01:12.576
they counsel children in crisis.

00:01:13.026 --> 00:01:16.836
&gt;&gt;Eric: Is it, when Mom and Dad
are fighting, do you go hide

00:01:16.836 --> 00:01:19.496
in your room, or what do you do,
so you don't have to hear it?

00:01:20.046 --> 00:01:21.886
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Grants Pass
is a high poverty area

00:01:21.886 --> 00:01:23.436
with many kids who need the help.

00:01:24.406 --> 00:01:28.616
Across town, at North Valley High
School, Epstein deals with everything

00:01:28.656 --> 00:01:31.256
from sexual abuse,
to drugs, to suicide.

00:01:31.256 --> 00:01:33.826
&gt;&gt;Student: I got my heart broken,

00:01:34.756 --> 00:01:38.926
and I didn't really think
there was much left to life,

00:01:38.926 --> 00:01:42.596
so I just decided I'd try and end it.

00:01:44.316 --> 00:01:47.056
It was a hard time
trying to get back.

00:01:47.306 --> 00:01:48.806
I got a lot of help from you.

00:01:48.806 --> 00:01:56.246
And it's getting easier
every day, but just barely.

00:01:57.006 --> 00:02:02.836
&gt;&gt;Eric: There is no better access
point in America, for connecting

00:02:02.836 --> 00:02:06.236
with kids and families,
than public school systems.

00:02:06.236 --> 00:02:09.696
Most traditional counselors, most
of their time is in an office

00:02:09.696 --> 00:02:15.936
that people have to come
to, in order to visit them.

00:02:15.936 --> 00:02:20.826
If we are able to go and be alongside
them in life, they have more trust

00:02:20.826 --> 00:02:23.806
that we can understand their
life, and we generally do.

00:02:24.616 --> 00:02:26.086
&gt;&gt;Student: I kind of freaked
people out with what I did.

00:02:26.156 --> 00:02:30.556
I got really mad for not really any
particular reason, and you know,

00:02:30.556 --> 00:02:32.826
I hit a locker, and my hand
was bleeding everywhere.

00:02:33.516 --> 00:02:40.396
[Playing guitar].

00:02:40.896 --> 00:02:43.516
&gt;&gt;Linda: For adolescents,
it's their peer relationships

00:02:43.796 --> 00:02:47.616
that are more important than anything
else going on in their lives.

00:02:47.616 --> 00:02:50.656
If we intervene separate from
those peer relationships,

00:02:50.686 --> 00:02:53.876
we may learn some great
things about the student,

00:02:54.456 --> 00:02:58.096
but we're not really hitting
it where the action is.

00:02:59.036 --> 00:03:02.466
&gt;&gt;Eric: It's one thing to have a
passionate belief that you hold onto,

00:03:02.466 --> 00:03:07.506
because you deeply believe in it,
and it's another, to become rigid

00:03:08.216 --> 00:03:12.816
and to not be able to have
that belief affected by people.

00:03:13.126 --> 00:03:14.986
&gt;&gt;Narrator: It costs
15,000 dollars a year

00:03:14.986 --> 00:03:19.056
to have an advocate ten hours a
week, a price mainly paid by grants.

00:03:19.426 --> 00:03:22.186
Discipline referrals have dropped
since the start of the program,

00:03:22.426 --> 00:03:24.796
and educators here say
there are further rewards.

00:03:24.836 --> 00:03:30.256
&gt;&gt;Ken: Well before Eric came to
our school, I had to be a counselor

00:03:30.386 --> 00:03:33.216
to the students, and I
had to handle situations

00:03:33.216 --> 00:03:35.136
that I really felt uncomfortable in.

00:03:35.426 --> 00:03:38.116
When Eric came onboard, it was
nice, because I was spending,

00:03:38.116 --> 00:03:42.106
probably 25 to 35 percent of my
time dealing with these situations,

00:03:42.576 --> 00:03:46.066
and here is somebody who's a
professional, that has training

00:03:46.066 --> 00:03:49.576
in this area, and better than
that, the kids will work with.

00:03:50.196 --> 00:03:51.486
&gt;&gt;Student: Thanks for being there.

00:03:51.576 --> 00:03:52.376
&gt;&gt;Eric: My pleasure.

00:03:53.266 --> 00:04:01.126
&gt;&gt;Student: I guess the thing I
needed today, is you can't stand

00:04:01.126 --> 00:04:02.656
up with your own two legs sometimes.

00:04:02.656 --> 00:04:04.036
You need another pair.

00:04:04.706 --> 00:04:05.806
Everyone does.

00:04:07.656 --> 00:04:10.146
