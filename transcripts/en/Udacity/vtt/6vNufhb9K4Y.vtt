We import person in car in simulation. We import car nowhere, because it's only

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:11.918
used by simulation. And simulation and car are in the same package already. We

00:00:11.918 --> 00:00:16.944
import simulation in the CarShareApp. Here's what that looks like in BlueJ. In

00:00:16.944 --> 00:00:23.038
the car class, we'll import com.udacity.person. In the simulation class, we'll

00:00:23.038 --> 00:00:26.112
also import com udacity person, and in the CarShareApp, we'll import

00:00:26.112 --> 00:00:31.190
com.udacity.carshare.Simulation. Now when I go back and compile the

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:38.162
CarShareApp, it'll work the way it did before. But now the code is organized

00:00:38.162 --> 00:00:41.013
into the correct packages.
