AMY: Hi, everyone.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.150
This is Amy, off camera this
time, happily, from App Engine

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:20.890
Developer Relations.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:26.660
And today, we're chatting with
all of the App Engine PMs.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.010
So this is a really great
opportunity for you guys to

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.480
ask them the difficult
questions, the questions we

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.070
all love, like when will such
and such be available on App

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.090
Engine, and all sorts of other
tricky and interesting

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.300
questions, anything
you can think of.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.800
They love it.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.500
And so we've opened up this
Hangout so that some of you

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.040
can join, up to nine additional
people, I believe.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.150
And so we hope that some of you
will, and you can ask your

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.940
questions in person.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.910
But what we're going to do
right now is have the PMs

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.530
introduce themselves briefly,
and then just take some

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.590
questions from the moderator.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.670
And if you go to the posted
event for this on

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.380
developers.google.com.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.730
You'll see a link to the
Moderator where you can add

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.670
more questions.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.710
All right, so I'll hand the
microphone over to the PMs.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.840
ANDREW: So hi, everyone.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:26.610
My name's Andrew.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.910
I'm a Product Manager on App
Engine from Sydney, Australia,

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.271
and my particular specialty is
the Python Runtime, so any

00:01:33.271 --> 00:01:37.150
Python questions, feel
free to hit me up.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.420
GREG: Hi, I'm Greg
[INAUDIBLE].

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.855
I'm the lead product manager on
Google App Engine out of--

00:01:41.855 --> 00:01:44.360
well, today I'm in Sydney,
Australia, but in general, out

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.340
of San Francisco.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.210
I pretty much do a little bit
of this and a little bit of

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.000
that, so I'll answer
the questions no

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.190
one else wants to.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.330
CHRIS: How are you doing?

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.340
My name is Chris.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.990
I'm also one of the product
managers for App Engine, and

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.060
as well as Greg, based out of
the Bay Area, San Francisco

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.700
office to be specific, but here
hanging out down under

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.370
with all the folks in Sydney,
which has been fantastic.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.650
So jack of many trades, but
focusing on data store and

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.550
other API-related things, so
I'll take any questions that

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:15.290
you have on that.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.581
All right, turn it over.

00:02:19.738 --> 00:02:20.890
CHRISTINA: Hi, I'm Christina.

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.150
I also work out of the San
Francisco office, and I'm a

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.200
Product Manager on App Engine.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.410
The things that I work on that
you probably care about are

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.400
the search API MapReduce
sockets, a couple other things

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.530
like Mail, and assorted
other things.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.390
I think that's all I work on.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:46.730
GREG: Should we start with some

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.040
questions from the Moderator?

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.290
AMY: Yes.

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.450
GREG: So, Chris?

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:58.020
CHRIS: Greg?

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.320
GREG: What's the easiest way
to move data between Data

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.310
Store and Cloud SQL?

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.460
AMY: [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:05.710
GREG: Oh.

00:03:07.428 --> 00:03:11.750
AMY: And as a prize for being
the first person to join the

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.300
Hangout before we go to the
Moderator questions, would you

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.072
like to ask any questions live,
or introduce yourself?

00:03:19.072 --> 00:03:20.720
And don't feel like
you have to.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:21.480
GREG: Not to put you
on the spot.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.960
AMY: Yeah, we don't want
to put you on the spot.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.210
GREG: And can you hear Amy?

00:03:28.574 --> 00:03:29.824
[INAUDIBLE]

00:03:41.305 --> 00:03:45.540
AMY: Unfortunately, you're
a little muted.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:46.790
GREG: Oh Gene.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.380
CHRIS: So Greg, you
were saying?

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.520
GREG: So I was wondering, what's
the easiest way to move

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.930
data between data store
and Cloud SQL?

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.450
CHRIS: So I think there's couple
ways of doing this.

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.060
One way might be to actually
do a backup from the data

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.410
store, and then read through the
data and do an import into

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.550
Cloud SQL, and you
can do that.

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.830
The format for doing the backup
is not proprietary, but

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:11.630
the documentation is still a bit
loose on that, so we'll be

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.350
tying that up in the
months to come.

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.250
But the other way to do it
where we've seen a lot of

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.390
people have success is to do
just a simple MapReduce over

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.500
your data storage [INAUDIBLE],
the ones that you want to

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.480
actually back up and import into
Cloud SQL, and then do

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.600
the mapping, the reducing, and
then pull it back into Cloud

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.310
SQL, and then you can do your
ad hoc queries and whatnot

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.660
from there.

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.110
So we really that's probably
the easiest way right now.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.720
GREG: Sounds great.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.160
Thanks.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.040
CHRISTINA: [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.970
if you've looked at any of the
MapReduce into Big Query

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.420
samples, those would be a good
starting point for anything

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:49.130
that you want to do to MapReduce
into Cloud SQL.

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:50.210
GREG: All right.

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.924
Until Gene rejoins
us, let me--

00:04:54.924 --> 00:04:56.175
AMY: [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:56.175 --> 00:04:57.675
GREG: Oh, Gene.

00:04:57.675 --> 00:04:59.860
I feel like we didn't
even say anything to

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.970
drive you away so quickly.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:03.590
CHRIS: Somebody email him.

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:04.895
GREG: Yeah.

00:05:04.895 --> 00:05:06.145
AMY: [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:08.695 --> 00:05:09.530
There's a few people watching.

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.960
Invite them to please
join life.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.140
GREG: Anyone who's watching,
please join us live.

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.940
Otherwise, we're just going to
keep on babbling, and you

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.680
don't want that.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.170
I will continue with questions
from the Moderator until we

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:24.350
see your smiling faces pop up.

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.500
So there's a question
here that I will

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.180
ask, I guess, myself.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.810
Let's say there are one billion
elements of a model.

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.815
Each of these one billion
elements share an index that

00:05:34.815 --> 00:05:36.220
is sorted by a float.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.950
If these one billion elements
each change the value of float

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:42.470
every approximately 10 seconds
diversely, can App

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:43.530
Engine handle it?

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:47.770
So it does feel like I'm back
interviewing for Google again,

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.990
in reading that question
to myself.

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.720
Well, I didn't read it to
myself at that point.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:58.320
So we're actually going to hold
this question and talk to

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.370
Alfred, who is our tech
lead for Data Store.

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.680
You've probably seen him posting
on Stack Overflow in

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.330
the groups, that
sort of thing.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.810
He'll have a better
answer for it.

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:13.700
Essentially, it seems like it's
a question around, what's

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:18.050
the load that Data
Store can handle?

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.270
As I'm interpreting it, it's
was the load Data Store can

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:24.370
handle in terms of frequency
of changes

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:25.800
to individual elements.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.620
So I think Alfred can do a
better job of answering that

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:30.859
than any of us could.

00:06:30.859 --> 00:06:32.109
AMY: [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.550
GREG: And we'll follow up on
the Moderator, that little

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:39.270
link where we post a response.

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.930
CHRIS: Are users able to
update the Moderator

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:43.610
questions as well?

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.660
AMY: [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:50.540
GREG: In case you can't hear Amy
anymore, the disembodied

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:51.560
voice that we keep on asking

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.240
questions of, who you probably--

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:57.650
those answers coming from
off screen, is Amy.

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:58.150
All right.

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:02.860
So let me ask the next question,
which is, Andrew,

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:05.790
can you describe some of the
security models that can be

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:07.550
used with Google App Engine?

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:10.262
ANDREW: So this is a good
question, actually, because I

00:07:10.262 --> 00:07:11.160
think this is something--

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.260
I hope you can all hear me.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.900
So this is a question, actually,
I think it's the

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:17.990
first question people
ask when they start

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:20.510
using Google App Engines.

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:22.580
I'm used to working with all
these different components,

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:25.750
say a LAMP stack, or with a
typical application server.

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:29.130
So how does it work
inside App Engine?

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:32.770
And of course the strict answer
to a question like this

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:33.710
is, it depends.

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:35.110
It depends what you're doing.

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:39.290
But the way a lot of App Engine
applications tend to

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:43.540
look, especially when you're
starting out, is you'll have

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:47.060
some HTTP request coming in from
the outside world, and

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:49.650
then you'll have some scripts
that will capture those

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:52.930
requests and handle them, and
then they will write some data

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:55.000
to a back end data store.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.270
And in App Engine, the way
that's handled is you've got

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:00.180
two things to think about.

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:04.540
The first is, how do we
control what HTTP

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:07.056
requests are coming in?

00:08:07.056 --> 00:08:09.120
Now, Christina, we have sockets
coming, so this will

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:16.520
change slightly, but for the
most part, most of the inbound

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.000
requests from the outside
world all

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.210
come in through HTTP.

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:23.080
So if you can control the HTTP
requests that are coming in,

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.690
then to a certain extent,
you can control how your

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:29.330
application is exposed
to the outside world.

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:30.860
So how do you handle
security on that?

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:33.480
And there's a few different
ways you can do that.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.539
The first is, of course, you can
write security yourself.

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:37.700
You can have your own
login systems and

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:40.210
authentication systems.

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:44.520
But we also provide some
additional support if you want

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:48.820
to use either OpenID or Google
Accounts to help manage your

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:53.280
security, we actually make
that super easy to do.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.660
We have a file in every App
Engine project called an

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:59.830
App.Yml file, that can define
where-- or in every Python and

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:01.430
Go project, I should say--

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:05.500
that will define explicitly how
HTTP requests get mapped

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:07.050
to a request handler.

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:13.680
And in that definition, you can
specify if that should be

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.125
restricted to users
who have logged in

00:09:16.125 --> 00:09:17.710
via a Google account.

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:19.520
And then if you want, you can
restrict it even further, and

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:22.740
I believe you can restrict it
to the level of saying, only

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:25.870
users who have a Google account
and who are also an

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:28.020
administrator of the
App Engine Project.

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:31.040
And that's really useful when,
let's say you have a few

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:35.110
administration components to
your application that really,

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:37.340
you want to be able to be
accessible to a web browser,

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:41.130
but you don't want to be
accessible to any Joe who's

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:43.860
coming to your website.

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:44.490
So that's one way.

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:48.610
And then of course, there's the
Data Store itself and this

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:50.950
important application data
that you've protected.

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:53.050
So your application code can
get to that, of course.

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:56.880
Your users can't get to it
unless they're able to

00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:00.240
indirectly via your
request handlers.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:02.190
And then the only other level
of security, really, is who

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:05.620
can actually access your
application account?

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:11.020
Who can log in and view the
dashboards and the consoles

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:12.500
that you have access to?

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:14.820
And that, again, is something
where you can explicitly

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:15.780
whitelist end users.

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:20.670
So you define precisely which
users you want to have access

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:24.410
to your App Engine Console,
all of the monitoring

00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:27.330
information that comes along
with your project, and any

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:29.670
data that you're storing.

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:32.220
That's a somewhat long-winded
answer, but hopefully it

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.320
touches on some of it.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:38.590
CHRIS: To add to that a bit, so
Andrew, you had touched on

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:40.680
some of the services that we
have like Data Store, and

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:43.470
things like that, and those are
all multi-tenant services

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:46.370
that are sliced and diced based
on name spaces that are

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:48.900
completely secure, thus one
application can access other

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:52.440
application's data, which
is great, right?

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:56.850
Until you have a larger
application, that is in some

00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:59.310
ways made up of logical
components, right--

00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:01.200
a front end to handle mobile
requests, a front end to

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.890
handle web requests, a back end
to do a billing pipeline.

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:06.900
And so since we have a bunch of
product managers here, we

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:08.910
can go ahead and talk about one
of the things that we're

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:12.760
doing now, and we just kicked
off a kind of small, Trusted

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:14.430
Tester program, but one of the
things we're looking to do as

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:18.450
we go forward in the upcoming
months is to give developers

00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:20.920
that have these large scale
applications a way to segment

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:23.470
their applications such that
you can have multiple

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:24.150
components.

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:25.420
We call them App
Engine Servers.

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:28.510
So real quickly, the hierarchy
now would be going forward,

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:32.680
App ID, server, then version,
then the instances of your

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:33.690
application.

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:35.260
And what you can do there,
then, is you can start to

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.790
break out your mobile front end,
your web front end, and

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:41.160
your billing pipeline into
multiple servers that can then

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:44.900
choose to access the same data
store, MEM cache, or you might

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:47.440
decide you want to close off
one of them so that your

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.460
billing pipeline can't
necessarily be accessed by

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:51.230
your web front end, because that
just doesn't necessarily

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:52.270
make sense.

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:54.570
And so we're taking that
multi-tenant approach and that

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:57.090
secure model we have today, and
looking to make it a bit

00:11:57.090 --> 00:11:59.390
more flexible, but still
making sure that other

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:00.590
applications--

00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:02.220
not servers within
an application--

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:04.200
still cannot access the
Data Store data.

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:08.600
So that's a little forward
thinking of where we're going.

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:09.446
GREG: Makes sense.

00:12:09.446 --> 00:12:10.200
AMY: [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.375
GREG: Yeah, I think we have
some people lives.

00:12:12.375 --> 00:12:15.252
Do you guys have
some questions?

00:12:15.252 --> 00:12:16.758
AMY: And if you want,
you can type them

00:12:16.758 --> 00:12:18.620
into the Chat window.

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:20.480
GREG: If you want,
you can type them

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:21.730
into the Chat window.

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:25.850
CHRIS: I see someone
is typing.

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:37.640
GREG: Amy, could you read
what the question

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:40.584
is in there to us?

00:12:40.584 --> 00:12:41.834
AMY: [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:45.484
GREG: OK.

00:12:45.484 --> 00:12:46.734
AMY: [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:52.200
GREG: Oh, so he wants
the answer, OK.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:56.540
So the short answer is, it
sounds like what you're asking

00:12:56.540 --> 00:13:07.770
about is specifically around
Data Store and what's the rate

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:11.080
of operation for elements
that can be handled?

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:13.980
And I think Alfred, really, who
is our Tech Leader with

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:16.750
Data Store is the best person
to answer that question.

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:19.060
So we're going to get him to
put an answer together, and

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:24.060
we'll post it back to the
Moderator once he gets that

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:26.101
answer together.

00:13:26.101 --> 00:13:30.660
AMY: Could you ask them them
both to check if they were

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:33.056
watching the broadcast
that that's muted?

00:13:33.056 --> 00:13:36.080
I'm hearing a bit of an echo.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.000
GREG: So Amy wanted me to check
with you guys that if

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.230
you're watching the
broadcast--

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:42.530
I think the echo just
went away--

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:46.610
just to make sure you might be
muted, so there's no feedback.

00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:48.860
AMY: Yeah, mute the broadcast.

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:50.110
GREG: Mute the broadcast,
yeah.

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:55.020
CHRIS: So on the topic of the--
the follow-up there that

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:56.820
I wanted to mention, and now
we've got the person that

00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:59.690
asked the question, definitely
a good idea to get Alfred to

00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:00.200
take a look at this.

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.580
I think he's had some great
thoughts on it.

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:05.070
But it's interesting to note
that back at IO, we mentioned

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:08.370
that one of the stats that we
put up there was that we're

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:11.980
handling roughly two trillion
operations per month in the

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:12.870
Data Store.

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:15.870
And max and I had some fun and
went digging around, and we're

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:18.230
up to actually 2.5
trillion now.

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:20.755
So I think this talks
about a--

00:14:20.755 --> 00:14:23.190
I think you and I did some math
in the QPS, but to give

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:25.720
you an aggregate view of what
we're doing, 2.5 trillion is

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:26.430
no small number.

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:28.605
So we'll get an answer back to
you, but I just wanted to

00:14:28.605 --> 00:14:29.740
throw out that data
point as well.

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:30.990
GREG: Sounds good.

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:41.330
So unless there are additional
questions from the people on

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:43.454
the Hangout, why don't I go to
the next one off the top of

00:14:43.454 --> 00:14:46.310
the list, which is, when EU
Hosting for App Engine Apps

00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:49.280
initially becomes available to
non-premier customers, will

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:52.190
all of the same services be
available locally, or are

00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:54.550
there some services that
will still need

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:57.324
to round trip EU-US-EU?

00:14:57.324 --> 00:14:58.770
Chris?

00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:02.690
CHRIS: So we are actively
rolling out the support to

00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:03.270
non-Premiere.

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:06.290
We look for that to hopefully
land in the next few months.

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:09.680
And in terms of the services
that are available, to the

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:11.940
best of my knowledge, all the
services that are available

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:15.760
today for US-based applications
will be available

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:17.580
in the EU as well and
will not round trip.

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:21.730
The whole idea there is that you
typically look to host in

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:25.090
other regions for two reasons,
and potentially more, but the

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:29.050
first that spring to mind are
latency, and then for some,

00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:31.370
they want to control where their
data is stored, which

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:34.440
means that it's not just storage
at rest, it's where

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:35.660
it's funneling through
the system.

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:37.890
So it's very important that it
all stays housed within that

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:38.910
data center.

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:41.200
And so yes, all those services
will be available, and there

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:45.640
will be no round tripping
back to the US.

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:51.760
GREG: So the next question, and
Amy will interrupt me if

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:53.840
somebody in the Hangout
has a question--

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:56.360
AMY: [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:57.610
GREG: Oh, excellent.

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:02.670
AMY: I asked if they wanted
to introduce themselves.

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:04.790
AUDIENCE: Yes, so
I'm [? Kahn. ?]

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:07.550
I have an App for your--

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:08.760
GREG: Is this [? Kahn Soro. ?]

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:09.720
AUDIENCE: It is.

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:11.280
GREG: Ah.

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:12.080
Hi.

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:16.310
I believe we've emailed in the
discussion groups before and

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:16.970
that sort of thing.

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:18.220
I recognize your name.

00:16:21.666 --> 00:16:23.330
AUDIENCE: --Facebook platform
is on App Engine, currently

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:25.320
working on something new.

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:27.670
AMY: And we just got someone
else to join.

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:30.610
Olivier.

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:32.570
GREG: Fantastic.

00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:37.600
Hi, Olivier,

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:39.735
CHRIS: So was there a question,
or [INAUDIBLE]?

00:16:39.735 --> 00:16:41.040
AMY: He's just introducing
himself.

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:41.880
GREG: OK, great.

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:42.200
Great.

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.630
Fantastic.

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:46.300
So I'll continue on this next
question, and we'll keep an

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:48.580
eye on the live Hangout.

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:52.500
So with the growing popularity
of Go, are we likely see a

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:54.900
greater allocation of resources
to the Runtime?

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:57.010
As a Go enthusiast, what
can I do to help

00:16:57.010 --> 00:16:57.910
speed up this process?

00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:00.300
Christina, do you want to?

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:03.470
I can answer, but you haven't
answered a question yet.

00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:05.230
CHRISTINA: Sure.

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:10.280
So the Go Runtime is definitely

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:11.099
gaining some momentum.

00:17:11.099 --> 00:17:13.859
We don't have any specific
numbers to share with you

00:17:13.859 --> 00:17:17.500
today, but we've seen some
pretty good adoption of it.

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:19.440
We are actively adding
features.

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:22.480
The Go team is actively adding a
bunch of features that we're

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:23.569
working on.

00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:26.650
There are a couple that aren't
quite ready for us to announce

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:29.510
yet, but that should
be coming soon.

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:32.060
And I think if you want to
actually contribute to Go,

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:34.800
there's an active community
externally, as well as

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:38.870
internally, working on Go, and
so I think there are a number

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:41.320
of things that are actually
external that you want to

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:42.830
contribute, you can.

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:45.830
But that's another thing we'll
have to go check around with

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:48.890
the Eng team and come up with
any specific suggestions, and

00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:51.460
we'll put them back
on the Moderator.

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:54.500
GREG: The good news is while
we're in Sydney, we sit right

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:57.570
next to the Go team, who is all
sitting down here, and so

00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:00.540
we'll just go downstairs and
ask them after this.

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:03.360
ANDREW: Go is getting super
popular inside Google as well,

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:05.910
which is always an
encouraging sign.

00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:07.160
GREG: Agreed, agreed.

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:13.090
Any new questions on
the live feed?

00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:15.350
All right.

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:18.680
MapReduce jobs that take more
than one hour fail to save to

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:21.610
Google Cloud Storage with
a File Not Open error.

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:22.670
I'm using the [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:25.520
workaround, but is there
any way to make it

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:26.770
work with Cloud Storage?

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:30.480
Christina?

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:35.640
CHRISTINA: So the question is
around MapReduce stability and

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:39.270
things taking longer and
having problems.

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:43.210
So we are actively working on
improving the stability of

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:46.320
sort of the Files API, which
is how we actually talk to

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:49.800
Google Cloud Storage, and making
that a bit more robust.

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:53.740
Intermittent failures I think
right now, we're at a state

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:57.030
where if something goes wrong
there, it's really tough to

00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:59.020
figure out what went wrong.

00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:01.640
And one of the nice things about
an experimental API is

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:05.010
that we actually are still
working on and improving it.

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:07.160
So definitely look for some
improvements to that coming

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:10.190
soon, hopefully in either our
next release or the release

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:11.150
after that.

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:13.170
And you should see both some
transparent stability

00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:16.190
improvements, as well as some
usability improvements to the

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:18.070
API that will make
those things last

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:19.430
a little bit better.

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:23.450
If you could actually post your
App ID either to me or to

00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:26.560
someone else, we can actually
take a look at your specific

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:27.800
case and see if there
is something we

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:30.970
can do in the meantime.

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:34.040
Everyone can find my email on
the groups, or you can feel

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:37.220
free to post on the Moderator,
or to send it to Amy, and we

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:39.910
can have a look.

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:41.680
CHRIS: So I think it's actually
worth noting, too,

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:42.690
how seriously we take this.

00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:46.600
Because whether you know or not,
under the hood, there's a

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:50.720
lot of other things actually
use our MapReduce framework

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:53.660
and APIs, as well as the file
system APIs, or the files API.

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:55.320
So case in point, something
that's near and dear to my

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:59.550
heart, so we have a backup and
restore mechanism that's in

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:01.530
experimental as well
right now.

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:04.480
And I really, really would like
to push that across the

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:07.020
finish line to GA, but one of
the things that's happening is

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:09.520
that since it does rely on the
files API, then we're looking

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:11.840
for stability there, and it kind
of works its way up the

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:13.870
chain, there's certain
dependencies.

00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:17.570
And so when you notice these
dependencies, it becomes very

00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:18.420
clear what you need to do.

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:20.630
And so like Christine has said,
we're looking actively

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:24.210
for hopefully in 1.74 or 1.75
that we have an update to the

00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:26.960
Files API, and then from there,
we can start to see how

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:29.470
things shake out and backup and
restore goes to GA soon

00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:30.050
afterwards.

00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:33.200
And so it's kind of like
dominoes falling in a good

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.980
way, actually.

00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:36.674
GREG: All right.

00:20:36.674 --> 00:20:41.325
AMY: So we have a question from
the Chat, that actually,

00:20:41.325 --> 00:20:45.190
you addressed earlier, but
you can address again.

00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:46.110
Someone online now.

00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:48.560
What is the easiest way to move
data between Data Store

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:50.140
and Cloud SQL?

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:50.550
GREG: Ah.

00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:55.600
So from the online Hangout,
there's a reiteration of the

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:59.330
question of the easiest way to
move data between Data Store

00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:00.450
and Cloud SQL.

00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:01.030
Chris?

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:04.980
CHRIS: Yeah, so to reiterate,
I had mentioned backup and

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:07.220
restore, backing it up and
then reading the file and

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:09.490
importing into Cloud
SQL as one way.

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:11.760
But really mentioned that the
way we're seeing success with

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:14.856
users, the way that we're seeing
people be successful is

00:21:14.856 --> 00:21:17.650
what I should say is to actually
do a MapReduce over

00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:19.465
your Data Store, pick the
[INAUDIBLE] that you want, do

00:21:19.465 --> 00:21:21.710
a map, do a reduce, and then
import into Cloud SQL, and

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:23.956
that seems to be working
quite well.

00:21:23.956 --> 00:21:24.450
GREG: All right.

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:27.400
Thanks, Chris.

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:32.545
So I'm going to keep on waiting
for Amy to share any

00:21:32.545 --> 00:21:34.312
new questions that come up.

00:21:34.312 --> 00:21:36.276
AMY: [? Kahn ?] has asked a
question on the Moderator

00:21:36.276 --> 00:21:36.767
[INAUDIBLE].

00:21:36.767 --> 00:21:37.610
GREG: Ah, yes.

00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:41.410
OK, well I see the question,
and let me do that one that

00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:42.210
immediately.

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:46.210
Is the Premiere account
creation any simpler?

00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:49.270
Last time I checked, it was
a must-be to be a company.

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:51.730
What kind of documents
are required to

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:52.710
create a Premiere account?

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:56.210
Can any company in any country
create a Premier account?

00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:58.950
Why don't I take that one?

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:08.720
So the Premiere account
creation, it's gotten faster

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:12.070
because we have more people
working on it.

00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:15.070
The main reason that somebody
must be a company is we

00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:20.670
actually have to do a credit
check because of, essentially,

00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:25.360
the way Premiere accounts work
and the way we open up the

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:30.120
services, essentially, Google
does a credit check on the

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:34.270
company first in order to ensure
that we can open up a

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:35.680
Premiere account to
you, which is why

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:37.510
incorporation is necessary.

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:44.140
In terms of the documentation
required, that's a great

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:47.240
question for our Sales Team.

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:51.310
We'll ping those guys to give
details around the specific

00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:52.675
documentation that
they'll require.

00:22:52.675 --> 00:22:55.970
And in terms of, can any company
in any country create

00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:57.220
a Premiere account?

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:03.390
There's a large number
of countries you can.

00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:09.470
There are some exceptions to
that, and I think we can also

00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:11.790
get that from the Sales
Team to post, what

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:13.050
are the list of countries?

00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:16.130
On some of the countries, we
can do essentially local

00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:20.140
contracts with you in that
country, and then there's

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:23.350
other countries where
essentially, you would sign a

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:28.060
US contract, or a contract
for another country.

00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:33.710
So we don't have contracts for
every single country, but for

00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:39.540
most countries, we'll sign a
contract, either a US or the

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:43.850
countries that we do
offer for you.

00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:46.500
But again, this is another one
where we'll go to the Sales

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:51.290
team, and we'll get from them
the list of documents that

00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:52.320
you'll need.

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:55.540
And as I said, the good news is
we have more people working

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:55.970
on this now.

00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:59.400
We have a larger team working
on the Premiere accounts,

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:00.210
which is good news.

00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:01.530
We're growing.

00:24:01.530 --> 00:24:05.830
But it also means you get much
faster responses in terms of

00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:07.010
creating Premiere accounts.

00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:09.600
I know early on, we were flooded
with requests, and so

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:13.340
it took a little while to get
those requests processed.

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:14.870
CHRIS: It's kind of worth noting
there too, it's not

00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:16.880
only that we are ramping up
the team that actually

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:20.110
on-boards premium customers,
which Greg's definitely right.

00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:23.740
We're actually ramping up
quickly the team that handles

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:24.930
the support requests as well.

00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:29.330
So I've personally seen that
team grow from a handful to

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:31.940
many, many folks that we have
going right now, and it's

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:32.650
working out pretty well.

00:24:32.650 --> 00:24:35.950
So I like the progress we're
making, all the way from the

00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:39.350
on-boarding to how
we handle support

00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:40.796
requests once you're there.

00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:45.130
GREG: Are there new questions?

00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:48.040
AMY: So, [? tons of ?]
useful information.

00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:53.035
And as you mentioned, it
would be great if we

00:24:53.035 --> 00:24:56.260
can find this online.

00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:58.860
We can update the Moderator.

00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:01.040
GREG: We'll update the
Moderator, and I'll also talk

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:03.180
to the Sales team about updating
our website to

00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:06.910
include this information, so
you don't have to track us

00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:08.710
down in Hangouts
and Moderators.

00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:12.360
I think that would probably be
the best thing to do, so I'll

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:16.000
talk to the Sales team
about getting that.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.220
And we'll update the Moderator,
but [? Kahn, ?]

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:20.620
feel free to reach out to
me as well about it.

00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:24.320
I think you probably have
my email address.

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:24.870
All right.

00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:28.110
So let's see, another
new question.

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:36.150
I'm just making sure I'm getting
all these questions.

00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:39.040
How can we apply for the
Trusted Tester Program?

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:40.870
It was just voted up
as I'm reading it.

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:43.440
How can we apply for the Trusted
Tester Program for

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:45.740
segmenting an application into
multiple deployments?

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:47.230
This would be extremely
useful to the

00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:47.930
application we're building.

00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:48.920
This is the one you had
just mentioned.

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:51.880
CHRIS: Yeah, so this is the
App Engine Servers feature

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:52.570
that I just mentioned.

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:56.400
So it's a very limited program
right now, because we really

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:57.620
just got it out the door.

00:25:57.620 --> 00:26:00.940
So look for an update to the
Groups that I'll send around,

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:04.455
probably within the next
month, I believe.

00:26:04.455 --> 00:26:07.650
We will reach out and grow it
from the small group to a

00:26:07.650 --> 00:26:08.810
larger group.

00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:11.990
That's kind of the life cycle we
have, start out small, get

00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:13.290
bigger, and then we'll
eventually get to

00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:14.730
experimental, and then
finally to GA.

00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:16.710
So look for an update from me.

00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:19.250
GREG: If you're interested right
now, though, I think

00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:23.130
just let us know your contact
information, and Chris will

00:26:23.130 --> 00:26:26.290
track that, and we'll add you to
the list once that goes up.

00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:26.740
CHRIS: Can they--

00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:27.990
AMY: [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:31.310
CHRIS: That's a very
good point.

00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:34.310
If you just email Amy, I'll
reach out to you, and we can

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:35.560
get things started.

00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:41.120
GREG: Any other questions?

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:41.910
All right.

00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:46.370
Then the last question, I think
the last new question

00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:49.530
I'm seeing in the Moderator
right now--

00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:51.580
wait.

00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:54.630
Here's another new one.

00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:56.090
So let's do them in order.

00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:59.500
Is there any way to make a
Python New Relic agent work on

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:02.080
App Engine?

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:03.945
ANDREW: So there's a long
answer and a short

00:27:03.945 --> 00:27:04.590
answer to that one.

00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:05.710
The short answer,
unfortunately,

00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:07.330
is no, at this stage.

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:13.770
Although it's not possible to
install the Python New Relic

00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:17.506
Agent in your application today
as I understand it.

00:27:17.506 --> 00:27:19.740
That being said, it would be
interesting to see if it could

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:26.020
be possible, given the we now
have outbound socket support.

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:29.460
So it's possibly something
that you could look into

00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:32.720
adapting the New Relic
Agent to doing.

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.946
AMY: You might mention that
that's an [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:41.870
ANDREW: So if anyone's on the
Trusted Tester Program and is

00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:44.110
a New Relic fan, that would be
a really interesting project

00:27:44.110 --> 00:27:45.720
to look at.

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:48.620
That being said, I don't believe
it's possible out of

00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:49.870
the box at this point.

00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:55.390
GREG: All right.

00:27:55.390 --> 00:28:03.310
And talking to an SSL VIP of an
App Engine app from the UK,

00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:06.230
the lower bound on when the
client hello of the initial

00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:08.980
SSL handshake arrives is
much greater than an

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:11.010
EU-US-EU round trip.

00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:13.220
It almost looks like there
might be two round trips

00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:13.900
behind the scenes.

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:14.960
Is that expected?

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:17.460
So if I understand the
question, what you're

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:21.160
basically saying is, when you're
using SSL, it seems

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:28.880
like we're doing a round
trip for that.

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:33.320
Andrew, can you talk to this?

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:35.680
ANDREW: Only to say
that a latency--

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:39.770
so it sounds like what you're
saying here is that your

00:28:39.770 --> 00:28:45.200
latency is almost twice as great
as going from the EU to

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:48.460
the US and back again,
which is surprising.

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:50.360
There is a little bit of routing
that goes on behind

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:55.590
the scenes, but I wouldn't
expect to see any hugely

00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:58.230
appreciable latency increase
as a result.

00:28:58.230 --> 00:28:59.940
So that's an interesting
question.

00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:03.096
I think that's something we'll
have to put to the SSL team.

00:29:03.096 --> 00:29:05.120
GREG: Yeah, I was going to say,
that actually sounds more

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:07.600
like a bug if that's
actually happening.

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:11.200
So we'll talk to the SSL team
about that, because that

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:12.450
shouldn't be the case.

00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:19.780
Sorry, I'm going through this
list again on the Moderator.

00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:20.310
[INAUDIBLE]

00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:21.320
Go, MapReduce.

00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:22.570
AMY: [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:24.850 --> 00:29:25.700
GREG: Ah, yes.

00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:29.070
I found it very hard to work
my way around the minutely

00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:33.010
quotas, especially URL
fetch minutely quota.

00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:34.690
My support requests
were unresulted.

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:39.220
Is it any easier now to get
these minutely quotas

00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:40.470
increased or removed?

00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:47.990
CHRIS: So first and foremost,
if you can send us your

00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:52.230
contact information, we can
follow up on that, so email

00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:53.585
address plus App ID would
be fantastic.

00:29:58.950 --> 00:30:02.200
If you're a Premiere customer,
you can go through the

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:05.860
Enterprise Support Portal to get
these bumped up as well.

00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:07.380
GREG: I believe this is
[? Kahn, ?] who was asking

00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:10.100
about also getting set up
as a Premiere account.

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:15.220
CHRIS: So in that case then, if
you can, send us your email

00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:17.130
address and your App
ID or App IDs.

00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:19.550
We'll follow up first on that,
and second of all, on where

00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:23.900
the requests are going
to bump these.

00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:27.530
Also, if you can, mention
where you

00:30:27.530 --> 00:30:28.330
submitted the request.

00:30:28.330 --> 00:30:31.590
I'm assuming it's from the Quota
Bump page that's live on

00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:34.470
developers.googl
e.com/appengine, but if it was

00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:35.530
somewhere else, please
let us know.

00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:37.350
We'll see where those requests
are going and make sure that

00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:39.920
they're funneling into the
correct queues so we can

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:41.170
handle them.

00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:45.160
GREG: Next question.

00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:47.750
It's funny, I see [? Kahn ?]
typing.

00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:51.190
I like the asynchronous
communication.

00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:53.835
AMY: And we just
had [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:01.100
GREG: Yeah.

00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:04.220
Introductions can
be frightening.

00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:08.240
So I think there's one
more question here.

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:12.130
And again, please continue
to add questions in.

00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:15.100
What are the tools supported
to integrate business

00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:17.080
intelligence into our apps?

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:20.410
I read that tools like Jasper
Reports or [? Bert ?] are not

00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:21.610
supported on App Engine.

00:31:21.610 --> 00:31:24.490
What are the alternatives to
generate reports and export

00:31:24.490 --> 00:31:26.980
them into different formats,
PDF, et cetera?

00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:29.230
Tools like Jasper Reports
or Bert are not

00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:30.480
supported on App--

00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:35.190
I was like, wow, that guy
sounds just like me.

00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:37.540
It was me.

00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:39.415
In terms of [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:43.990
Unless anyone else wants to
take it, I can take it.

00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:45.680
CHRIS: Go for it.

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:47.660
GREG: Why don't I start,
and you can chime in.

00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:56.280
So it kind of depends on what
exactly you're looking to do,

00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:58.920
and it sounds like you're
looking to have PDF reports,

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:00.890
that sort of thing.

00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:05.130
One of the things that some
people do is MapReduce.

00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:08.300
MapReduce is a great way to
extract large amounts of

00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:13.720
information and put it into
kind of a concise format.

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:18.210
The other thing you could do,
is we talked earlier about

00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:20.340
moving Data Store data
into Cloud SQL.

00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:24.550
One of the things you can do
with a MapReduce, and this is

00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:28.240
actually a very useful thing
to do is rather than using

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:33.760
Cloud SQL necessarily to serve
all your data, you can do

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:37.260
daily MapReduces to extract
and consolidate the

00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:40.560
information you want into Cloud
SQL, so then Cloud SQL

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:45.900
is essentially just a SQL
database that you're doing

00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:49.280
queries against to get
this sort of ad hoc

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:50.380
information you want.

00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:56.750
There's also a product called
BigQuery, which allows you to

00:32:56.750 --> 00:33:00.770
essentially do ad hoc queries
on much larger databases, or

00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:04.440
much larger sets
of information.

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:06.740
And again, you can do MapReduces
to take your Data

00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:09.040
Store data and move
it into BigQuery.

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:14.510
And so I think between
MapReduce, Cloud SQL, and

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:17.570
BigQuery, those are sort of the
three best mechanisms to

00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:18.920
do analytics.

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:24.060
Now, in terms of then turning
that into a PDF report, I

00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:27.450
don't think we have--

00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:28.163
excuse me?

00:33:28.163 --> 00:33:28.910
CHRISTINA: Python
Image Library.

00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:29.720
GREG: Oh, that's true,
that's true.

00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:33.450
There's Python Image Library,
so you can generate it

00:33:33.450 --> 00:33:38.650
yourself if you wanted to,
and turn it into a PDF.

00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:39.370
CHRIS: Yeah.

00:33:39.370 --> 00:33:41.425
I think I totally agree.

00:33:41.425 --> 00:33:43.470
But to take one of your
thoughts and go

00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:44.000
a little bit further.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.730
So we have had a lot of success
with companies, gaming

00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:50.370
companies and just general
Fortune 500 companies, doing

00:33:50.370 --> 00:33:52.490
what Greg mentioned, which was
a MapReduce into Cloud SQL,

00:33:52.490 --> 00:33:54.330
but more importantly, a
MapReduce into BigQuery.

00:33:54.330 --> 00:33:56.880
In fact, we have some blog
posts talking about that,

00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:59.030
we've got a Trusted Tester
program where we're actually

00:33:59.030 --> 00:34:02.570
using Data Store backups to
import into BigQuery.

00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:05.500
So those are ways to get your
data into BigQuery, and from

00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:08.870
there, there's a very easy
SQL-like mechanism or language

00:34:08.870 --> 00:34:10.380
you can use to query
your data.

00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:13.429
But what I was going to add is
that there are third parties

00:34:13.429 --> 00:34:15.909
out there that are tools vendors
that have actually

00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:18.880
integrated with BigQuery to give
you that visualization.

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:21.600
And so really slick-looking
dashboards, things you would

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:25.179
expect to have doing BI, as
well as the ability to do

00:34:25.179 --> 00:34:27.969
report generation, exporting
and things like that.

00:34:27.969 --> 00:34:30.639
GREG: And if you really love App
Engine, you can build an

00:34:30.639 --> 00:34:34.520
App Engine app to present
and display this sort of

00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:36.330
information yourself as well.

00:34:36.330 --> 00:34:39.690
But that's a great point.

00:34:39.690 --> 00:34:43.909
The tools vendors out there that
work with BigQuery can

00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:45.489
help you present information.

00:34:45.489 --> 00:34:47.650
One of the things we really want
you to be able to do is

00:34:47.650 --> 00:34:50.219
to do fast, ad hoc queries.

00:34:50.219 --> 00:34:56.710
A lot of BI classically has been
running reports to take x

00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:59.990
number of minutes, hours, or
days to run, to give you

00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:02.720
information, and I think one of
things we're really pushing

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:08.460
for BigQuery to be able to not
have to have these static

00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:11.260
reports that take a long time
to run, and then you end up

00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:15.340
having them, so you run them
daily or that sort of thing,

00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:18.240
but really being able to do the
type of ad hoc analysis

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:21.050
that you need to, in order to
understand what's going on in

00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:21.930
your business.

00:35:21.930 --> 00:35:24.770
CHRIS: You should be able to
find those technologies at

00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:27.890
cloud.google.com/partners, I
believe, is where I looked

00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:29.290
last night.

00:35:29.290 --> 00:35:32.640
So take a look there, and then
I'm sure on BigQuery's main

00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:34.335
page, they link to
it somewhere.

00:35:34.335 --> 00:35:39.037
AMY: And also the Google
Developers Google Plus page

00:35:39.037 --> 00:35:40.780
has lots of information.

00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:43.080
GREG: So Amy was saying, the
Google Developers' Google Plus

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:44.910
page is a great source
of information.

00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:46.940
AMY: Cloud.

00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:47.440
GREG: Cloud.

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:50.730
The Cloud page on G+.

00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:51.680
AMY: [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:52.930
GREG: That's a mouthful.

00:35:56.070 --> 00:35:57.290
Let's see.

00:35:57.290 --> 00:35:59.840
I don't think any new questions
have come in.

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:01.030
Oh, is there one online?

00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:01.360
AMY: Yes.

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:01.930
GREG: Excellent.

00:36:01.930 --> 00:36:04.519
AMY: Sebastian has joined
us, he had some of

00:36:04.519 --> 00:36:05.130
the questions that--

00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:06.380
GREG: Sebastian.

00:36:09.341 --> 00:36:11.265
Hey!

00:36:11.265 --> 00:36:14.100
AMY: Please introduce
yourself.

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:14.790
SEBASTIAN: I'm Sebastian.

00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:16.396
I'm from Argentina.

00:36:16.396 --> 00:36:20.500
I run a small development
company called [INAUDIBLE],

00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:25.430
like Developers Argentina, and
we do a lot of [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:33.620
I have in my dashboard 44 apps,
so I had to [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:35.810
the ones that I have.

00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:37.390
[INAUDIBLE]

00:36:37.390 --> 00:36:39.370
take some time to get to that.

00:36:42.682 --> 00:36:44.040
I made two questions.

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:47.270
One was about MapReduce.

00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:51.780
The issue I think I'm having
is that I'm using the

00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:56.720
MapReduce [INAUDIBLE] to copy
the data from a large database

00:36:56.720 --> 00:37:00.500
in Data Store to be queried to
do analytics for the marketing

00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:06.120
team of one of the clients we
have, and it's taking more

00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:08.220
than one hour, [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:12.500
launching more than
100 charts.

00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:17.510
So I cannot launch more charts
to make it shorter.

00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:20.880
And what I think is happening is
that the access token that

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:23.806
gets the library to talk with
the cloud storage gets

00:37:23.806 --> 00:37:30.055
invalidated in one hour, so I
guess it's something around

00:37:30.055 --> 00:37:31.305
that thing.

00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:37.560
The other question I make was
about [INAUDIBLE], which I

00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:44.030
love for when I'm using Amazon
And I was talking with one of

00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:48.350
the guys, that brought
[INAUDIBLE]

00:37:48.350 --> 00:37:52.510
and I think he told me that he
tried to make it work on the

00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:59.630
App Engine, and the issue was
that he wasn't able to launch

00:37:59.630 --> 00:38:05.120
a background thread to
contact New Relic.

00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:11.390
So I don't know if someone has
tried it after the Python 2.7

00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:18.630
was released, and if anybody was
able to make [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:23.200
to contact New Relic after the
request has been completed?

00:38:26.290 --> 00:38:29.510
GREG: So I guess, Christina,
do you

00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:31.670
want to take the MapReduce?

00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:33.760
CHRISTINA: So for the MapReduce
one, I actually

00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:38.240
suspect that you're correct,
that your token is being

00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:42.600
invalidated after 15 minutes,
and then, you can't actually

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:44.420
access Google Cloud Storage.

00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:48.110
It would be really helpful if
you could send us your App ID,

00:38:48.110 --> 00:38:50.720
and we can take a look and see
if there are a couple of

00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:51.480
things that we can do.

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:53.940
We're looking at adding some
functionally, both to

00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:54.320
[? files ?]

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:58.570
API and to MapReduce, in terms
of improving the shuffler, and

00:38:58.570 --> 00:39:01.870
seeing it if either of those
would potentially just solve

00:39:01.870 --> 00:39:04.650
the problem immediately
in the meantime.

00:39:04.650 --> 00:39:05.830
But I think that's
probably the best

00:39:05.830 --> 00:39:08.680
way for us to proceed.

00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:10.250
I don't think we can do
much more without

00:39:10.250 --> 00:39:11.500
more technical detail.

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:11.790
GREG: Yes.

00:39:11.790 --> 00:39:14.030
Send us your App ID, and
then we'll look into it

00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:17.730
specifically, to debug that
problem for you, because it

00:39:17.730 --> 00:39:19.635
probably means other people are
running and doing exactly

00:39:19.635 --> 00:39:21.360
the same thing.

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:24.686
And then in terms of--

00:39:24.686 --> 00:39:25.150
SEBASTIAN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:26.410
GREG: You're welcome.

00:39:26.410 --> 00:39:29.420
And then in terms of
New Relic, Andrew

00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:32.580
mentioned this earlier.

00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:36.560
I think there's probably
two problems.

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:45.530
One is being able to-- because
I do believe New Relic uses a

00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:48.174
non-HTTP protocol,
I should say.

00:39:48.174 --> 00:39:50.640
AMY: [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:51.120
GREG: No.

00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:53.020
It probably doesn't, but it
probably does have to connect

00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:56.050
to the New Relic server, and so
I think you would have to

00:39:56.050 --> 00:39:59.450
do that with the new
sockets API.

00:39:59.450 --> 00:40:03.480
And even then the other aspect
is just, as you mentioned,

00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:06.440
being able to spawn off a
new thread to run in the

00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:09.580
background to do that.

00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:14.080
So I don't New Relic well
enough to know, but my

00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:20.670
suspicion is that could be
a challenge, as well.

00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:22.770
ANDREW: It might be something
you could do with back ends.

00:40:22.770 --> 00:40:26.090
Again, it would be something I
think we'd have to look into

00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:28.300
and you'd have to try out,
but certainly, you'd want

00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:31.720
somewhere where you've got a
stable, long-running process

00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:33.230
that controls sockets.

00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:35.120
CHRIS: Sebastian, did you
mention that you had been in

00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:37.210
contact with one of
the team members?

00:40:37.210 --> 00:40:38.440
SEBASTIAN: Yes.

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:40.290
ANDREW: Actually, Sebastian
has put his answer in the

00:40:40.290 --> 00:40:41.540
[INAUDIBLE]

00:40:43.790 --> 00:40:45.410
GREG: Fantastic.

00:40:45.410 --> 00:40:47.660
So you've been in contact with
one of the New Relic team

00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:49.150
members, or one of the App
Engine team members?

00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:50.110
SEBASTIAN: Yes.

00:40:50.110 --> 00:40:50.810
No, New Relic.

00:40:50.810 --> 00:40:51.222
GREG: New Relic?

00:40:51.222 --> 00:40:52.460
Ah.

00:40:52.460 --> 00:41:00.050
So I think if they tried it out,
you can close the loop

00:41:00.050 --> 00:41:03.570
between us and them, and we'd
talk to them about it too, to

00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:04.930
see if we can get it
working with them.

00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:12.500
I know someone on our team has
talked to New Relic before,

00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:17.250
but even so, let's connect up
and we can see if we can get

00:41:17.250 --> 00:41:18.290
it working.

00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:19.650
CHRIS: I've talked to them
several times on the Java

00:41:19.650 --> 00:41:22.140
side, so I don't claim to know
what's going on on the Python

00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:24.100
side, but we have
talked to them.

00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:25.880
We think they have some
fantastic technology.

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:30.310
The Java side has its own set of
problems in terms of class

00:41:30.310 --> 00:41:31.000
rewriting, [? byte code ?]

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.050
rewriting, some invasive stuff
that we'd love to work around,

00:41:34.050 --> 00:41:37.720
but we can try to close the loop
between your contacts or

00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:41.640
our contacts, try to figure
out what's going on.

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:42.630
SEBASTIAN: Great.

00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:43.890
Thank you.

00:41:43.890 --> 00:41:44.800
GREG: Absolutely.

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:47.470
Thank you for using App
Engine in Argentina.

00:41:55.170 --> 00:41:57.893
I don't see any other questions
on the Moderator.

00:42:00.472 --> 00:42:03.210
CHRIS: Do we just start asking
each other random questions

00:42:03.210 --> 00:42:05.180
about App Engine?

00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:06.430
I'm kidding.

00:42:15.570 --> 00:42:18.292
CHRIS: Look, he's got his--

00:42:18.292 --> 00:42:19.542
GREG: Yeah, plushie!

00:42:23.590 --> 00:42:25.360
CHRIS: That's fantastic.

00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:27.900
GREG: I think I've got to go
down, visit Argentina.

00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:30.830
I think that's what it seems
like, we all need to make a

00:42:30.830 --> 00:42:33.940
trip down to Argentina.

00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:35.390
SEBASTIAN: You will
be welcome.

00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:37.630
GREG: Excellent.

00:42:37.630 --> 00:42:39.070
SEBASTIAN: I got this
one from [? Ikay. ?]

00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:44.730
GREG: Sorry, say that again.

00:42:44.730 --> 00:42:46.695
SEBASTIAN: I got this
one from [? Ikay, ?]

00:42:46.695 --> 00:42:48.460
I think is his name.

00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:51.220
GREG: Oh, Ekai, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:52.470
SEBASTIAN: Ekai, sorry.

00:42:59.381 --> 00:43:01.960
AMY: OK, why don't you ask if
anyone watching this to jump

00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:03.270
in for last minute
live questions.

00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:08.220
GREG: And if anyone wants to
jump in for a last minute live

00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:11.040
question, let me know.

00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:15.330
And did I see [? Kahn ?] asking
a question of where did

00:43:15.330 --> 00:43:17.950
he get the plushie?

00:43:17.950 --> 00:43:23.410
We might be able to hook
[? Kahn ?] up with a plushie.

00:43:23.410 --> 00:43:27.900
I think, contact Amy with
your info, and we'll

00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:30.710
see what we can do.

00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:33.720
CHRIS: She's now going to
get 10,000 requests.

00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:35.650
GREG: Well, I mean, if other
people joined the Hangout,

00:43:35.650 --> 00:43:37.470
then they too could have--

00:43:37.470 --> 00:43:39.260
AMY: [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:40.510
GREG: Yeah, exactly.

00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:44.780
CHRIS: Use the coupon code.

00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:47.870
GREG: So unless there's any
more live questions that

00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:52.310
people wanted to ask, and I
don't see anything else on the

00:43:52.310 --> 00:43:53.450
Moderator--

00:43:53.450 --> 00:44:00.164
I think we'll say our Hangout
has been hung out.

00:44:00.164 --> 00:44:01.370
CHRIS: Has been hung out, yes.

00:44:01.370 --> 00:44:03.030
It was quite pleasant.

00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:03.690
This was great.

00:44:03.690 --> 00:44:04.040
GREG: Yeah, yeah.

00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:06.460
Thank you very much.

00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:08.860
Because the Product Management
Team is split between Sydney

00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:11.920
and San Francisco, we don't all
get to see each other all

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:13.900
the time, so it's always great
when we're together in one

00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:16.640
room and can chat.

00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:19.590
CHRIS: Yeah, definitely.

00:44:19.590 --> 00:44:20.520
All right.

00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:20.900
ANDREW: Fantastic, guys.

00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:21.570
Thank you.

00:44:21.570 --> 00:44:22.820
GREG: See you guys, thanks.
