Hey it's me Destin. Welcome back to Smarter Every Day. So you've noticed that moths

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.040
and other bugs sometimes get trapped around a light. Have you ever thought about why?

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.090
[music]

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.370
We are in the middle of the Amazon rainforest and we have

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.410
a huge mercury vapor light that Gerson setup for us.

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.450
And we are looking at all the different

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.510
species that have shown up. This is Phil Torres,

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:36.520
he is a, what do you call it?
- Entomologist.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.530
- Entomologist? Is that with a d or a t?
- With a t.
- Entomologist. So tonight

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.540
we are studying why these insects get caught around the light. The term for this

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.570
is called Phototaxis. So an organism is

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.620
phototactic if it responds to light with motion.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.670
A positively phototactic animal will move toward a light and a negatively

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.680
phototactic animal, it doesn't necessarily have to be an animal. I guess.. think about it leaves

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.690
are phototactic. So here's what we're doing.

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.730
They are going through, are you taking photos of all the different species?
- Mmm hmm.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.770
A good amount of them yeah.
(Destin) You've got one on your ear, hold on. Got him.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.820
Man I have been moving around and I haven't seen the same species twice.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.870
Oh that's a pretty one.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.910
That is a crazy look.. Is that a moth?

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.990
- Yeah.
(Destin) Is this how entomologists find new species?

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.030
- Yeah, this is a really good way because they just come right to you.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.090
(Destin) You just sit around?
- Just kind of sit around and different things come at different times of night,

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.100
so what we see now may be completely different in like 3 hours.
- That's awesome.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.120
What do you call these big ones Phil?
- A sphinx moth.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.140
- That's a sphinx moth? And then what about this guy with the little..

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.980
Princess Leia ears?
- Ahh. I think that's a kind of silk moth.
- OK We've demonstrated

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.780
that the mercury vapor lamp is effective in bringing the species out of the forest and onto the bedsheet,

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.580
but what we haven't answered is our question.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.650
Why are they attracted to the light in the first place? Well I was surprised to find out that most

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.700
of the literature on the subject was written in the 50s, 60s and 70s. It's really old.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.750
So here's what we're gonna do. I pulled out two theories from the literature and we're gonna demonstrate them both.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.840
This is an old Sphinx moth that I got two years ago. Check it out.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.880
If we take this, and we use it and combine it with some lunar footage that I got

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.900
from my buddy Jack, we can demonstrate theory number one.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.930
Moths use heavenly bodies like the sun and the moon to orient themselves in free flight.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.970
The idea is that they see the moon up in the sky and they try to keep themselves aligned

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.020
at a certain angle with the moon. Now because the moon is so far away that angle pretty much

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.060
stays the same as they fly along. Now imagine we brought the moon down to the earth.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.110
As he goes underneath his viewing angle would change more rapidly and he has to

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.150
pitch up in order to compensate for it. This ends up pointing him just beyond the far edge

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.160
of the light source. This would induce a logarithmic spiral which is pretty easy

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.190
to define with math. We should be able to look at the footage of the moth flying around that

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.260
mercury vapor lamp and figure out if there's a logarithmic spiral right?

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.270
I used the Phantom to record some high speed footage of those moths flying around the lamp in hopes of

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.390
plotting that logarithmic curve, but because the generator was running on AC,

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.530
that light was blinking and so I decided not to even analyze the footage.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.570
Instead, I found some photos that a potter named Steven took and submitted to Nat Geo.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.630
His open shutter method proved to be more effective. Look at those curves. Do you see any logarithmic spirals?

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.670
Kinda maybe, but the problem is there's several moths

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.770
that you can see flying directly in towards the light. That kind of debunks our theory doesn't it.

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.890
This leads us to theory number two. If you're a moth in the woods and you see a

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.900
little bright spot over to your side, you can assume that's a wide open area.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.920
Therefore you can free fly without getting hit by trees and sticks and stuff like that.

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.040
So the theory goes that these species of moths will align themselves with

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.090
a light and fly directly towards it. So after looking at all these theories,

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.120
and making my own observations, I took high speed video of cicadas flying around lanterns.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.160
Something became painfully clear to me.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.210
Science does not know why insects that are phototactic are attracted to light.

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.250
We think we know, but we don't. I mean at a base level

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.310
we don't know what's happening. This is such a simple thing for humans not to know.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.380
We've been observing this for hundreds of years. So as long as humans have had fire,

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.460
we've known that bugs are attracted to artificial light. So it was only a matter of time before we

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.570
invented things like the bug zappers. Hold on.

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.640
[Hitting bug zapper]
You buy a bug zapper you expect it to work. Go. There you go. Sorry.

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.750
Obviously these things don't work as advertised. Let me explain why. So if I read the literature correctly,

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.770
more bugs will go to the UV light because more bugs can see that wavelength.

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.800
Now this is interesting but the problem is, mosquitos aren't the only type of bugs

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.840
that's dying on these things. You might be doing more harm to the moth population than you are actually

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.880
doing to the mosquito population. Mosquitos are actually attracted to carbon dioxide, which is why

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.990
they have these little inserts of octanol or something like that that they put in the bottom of these things.

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.020
One last thing. You see these black baffles on the side of the bug zapper?

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.030
Now that's there for a very specific reason. Remember how we talked about how a moth or another bug will try to go towards

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.070
the side of a light source instead of directly at it? Now what these baffles do is they

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.110
create the illusion of multiple small light sources. So when a bug comes in

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.150
and he sees those small light sources he tries to go for the side of one, and unfortunately he goes directly

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:14.190
in towards the electrified grid, [snaps fingers] getting zapped. Anyway,

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:18.210
that's pretty interesting. So, moths and other bugs do not fly solely on

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:22.270
light sources alone. They also use other cues light pheremones. How do I know

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:26.340
that moths fly with pheremoes, especially while mating? I read it in a book,

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.400
while I was flying.

You might be aware that Audible actually sponsors Smarter Every Day, so I recommend an audio book,

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.650
you can download it for free and it helps Smarter Every Day. Right now I'm actually reading a book.

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:50.700
It's by a guy named E.O.Wilson, Edward Wilson.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.740
He went to the University of Alabama just like I did. Pulitzer Prize winner,

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.790
he's a really good guy. Anyway what's interesting is, he is a bug expert.

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.820
From my state. Pretty cool. The book I'm reading right now is called Letters to a Young Scientist,

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.870
right now I'm reading about moth pheremones. Pretty neat. It's actually pretty good

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:10.930
I'll let you look out the window real quick, just so you know where we're at.

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:15.000
Anyway, the Letters to a Young Scientist is about Edward Wilson's long career and what he learned

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.070
and didn't learn while he was studying insects. You can go check it out.

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:23.160
The cool thing is you can learn from his mistakes and the things that he did that worked

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:27.230
Go check it out. Audible.com/smarter. You can download a free audio book.

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:31.260
Top link in the video description, that'd help me out. Thanks, have a good one.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.290
[aircraft noise]

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:39.350
So the theory is that as you're flying, the

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:43.400
closing angle between.. thank you.. the bug,

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:47.440
and the moon, the artificial moon will change, and he tries to keep it over head.

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:51.550
And as he's flying... [loud insect sound]

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:55.690
[laugh] [insect sound fades] Thank you. As he's flying, he always keeps the

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:59.750
"moon" on top of him, and he just ends up in this rotational pattern.
