00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.740
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: From the Library
of Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:15.650 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Kurt Dewhurst: I'm Kurt Dewhurst.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.900
I am the Chair of the
Board of the Trustees

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.340
of the American Folklife Center
here at the Library of Congress

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.640
and I really want to welcome you
to this really very special event,

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.430 position:56%
something we've been looking forward
to for actually a number of years

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.840
as we started to think
about our 40th anniversary.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.010
Today's roundtable
discussion is part

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.140
of the American Folklife Center's
active year-round commitment

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.510
to public programming, a commitment
that includes, as many of you know,

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.420
the Benjamin A. Botkin
lecture series,

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:52.200
the Homegrown concert series, in
symposia on a wide range of topics,

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.930
Open Mic interviews and
numerous other special events.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.150
These public programs
form an important part

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.030
of the Center's acquisitions
activities.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.510
Each event is videotaped
and becomes part

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.030
of the Library's permanent
collections.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.130
In addition, the videos of these
events are posted to the Library

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.900
of Congress website where
they are available for viewing

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.040
for internet patrons
certainly throughout the world

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.360
and we've been finding more and
more that people are using these,

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.250
which is very gratifying for us.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.010
As many of you know, this year,

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.440
because we are celebrating
our 40th anniversary

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.740
at the American Folklife Center,

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.370
we're doing a number
of special activities.

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:42.590
The Center was created in 1976
by the US Congress "to preserve

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.950
and present American folklife
through programs of research,

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.240
documentation, archival
presentation, reference service,

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.380
live performance, exhibitions,
publications, and training.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:02.560
Designed by Congress as "a national
Center for folklife," it continues

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.220
to play an important role in
the documentation, research

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.780
and the Center continues to collect

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.600
and document living traditional
culture, while preserving

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.140
for the future its
unparalleled archival collections

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.250
in state-of-the-art, preservation
facilities of the Library

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.940
of Congress that continually are
upgraded and we're very grateful

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.520
for that opportunity to be able

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.310
to make these collection
so available now.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.300
In addition to its active
public programming schedule,

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.120
the Center's archive houses the
largest ethnographic collection

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.420
in the world.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.130
As of 2016, its holdings
include more than 5 million items

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.130
of ethnographic documentation
that record folklore

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.980
and traditional expressions
of the United States

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.920
and other nations throughout
the world.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.920
The AFC archives includes
outstanding holdings

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.850
of sound recordings of more than
350,000 hours in diverse formats

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.980
and over 800,000 photographs,
field notes

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.130
and other manuscript
materials, videotapes

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.170
and other visual formats and,
of course, ephemera dating

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.620
from the late 19th century
through the present day,

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.520
but the archive's peerless
recordings didn't appear magically,

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.820
as you know.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.780
Over the years, the Center's growth

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.560
and increasing prominence were
guided by the dedicated efforts

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.630
of its staff and heading that staff
are the Center's current director

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.800
and two former directors,
who are with us today.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.950
And for this discussion, we'll
have a rich opportunity to be able

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.510
to hear directly from them and I
might say they haven't had a chance

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.430
to rehearse or prepare for how
this might go and I think they're

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.760 position:56%
as anxious to hear from one another.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.890
So, I want to ask you to join me
in welcoming Dr. Alan Jabbour,

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:01.780
who led the Center from its
beginning to-- from 1976 to 1999,

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:07.770
Dr. Peggy Bulger who headed
the Center from 1999 to 2012,

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.940
and the current AFC
Director Betsy Peterson,

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.170
who assumed this leadership
of the Center in 2012.

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:20.170
Now, before you-- we welcome them
officially, I'm going to turn

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:23.490
over the proceedings to my
colleague, Cliff Murphy,

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.100
who is the Director of
Folk and Traditional Arts

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.450
at the National Endowment for the
Arts and who has kindly agreed

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.520
to serve as moderator for
this roundtable discussion

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.160
of the Center's historical
initiatives and programs

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.250
as well as its future prospects.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:45.070
But before I do, I want to
thank you again for coming today

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.170
and for your interest in
the unique cultural treasure

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:52.130
that really is a cultural
treasure of our nation,

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.210
the American Folklife Center.

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.850
Please join me in welcoming
our panel and our moderator.

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.150
[ Applause ]

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:10.010
&gt;&gt; Cliff Murphy: Hello everybody.

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:16.600
I'm Cliff Murphy and it's my
pleasure and honor to be up here

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.190
and to moderate, though, admittedly
I imagine that I have three--

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.220
the three tops here that once we
let them go, they're just going

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:30.290 position:56%
to run their own course here, so I
have an easy job of steering, right?

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:34.430
And I may have to pat
you on the shoulder or--

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:35.960
&gt;&gt; Alan Jabbour: While
we're spinning.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.260
&gt;&gt; Cliff Murphy: Yes, while
you're spinning just say, "Hey,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:43.670
let's let Betsy speak,"
for instance.

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:46.380
[ Laughter ]

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.120
Betsy being the junior, yes?

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.930
So before we do that and, you know,

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.720
I am sitting thinking this is a
really remarkable moment for all

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.090
of us and for our discipline.

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:03.010
I think that in the time Alan
that you first took the helm

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.660
of the Center, we've had--
over that time, we've had,

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.700
I think seven sitting
presidents, right,

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.370
and yet we have three
directors of the Center.

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.710 position:56%
And I'm not even trying to be funny.

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.010
I think that--

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:15.310
&gt;&gt; Alan Jabbour: Wow,
I never counted that.

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:16.610
That's amazing.

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:17.910
&gt;&gt; Cliff Murphy: Yeah.

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.020
And I think here in the audience,
I see Barry Bergey and Dan Sheehy,

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.460
so two-- my two predecessors-- two
of my three predecessors at the NEA

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.450
in Folk Traditional Arts are here.

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:34.250
Let's give a hand for
there-- for them.

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:35.550
[ Applause ]

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:37.300
And there's at least two directors
of the Center for Folklife

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.330
and Cultural Heritage here,
Michael and Dan, you're two for--

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.360
[ Laughter ]

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:49.530
And there may be others here who
have played that significant role

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:55.560 position:56%
in steering our federal partnerships
and what that says to me is

00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:01.530
that our field is in many ways
still young and yet we've--

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:05.510 position:56%
you know, here we are at this moment
where there's so much that we have

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:07.940
to learn from each of
you and from one another

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:12.080
and so I'm feeling privileged to
be up here on the stage with you --

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.820
and somewhat terrified,
so as it should be.

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:17.120
And--

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.420
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: Do we?

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:19.720
[ Laughter ]

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.020
&gt;&gt; Alan Jabbour: We'll
join you in that soon.

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:22.320
&gt;&gt; Cliff Murphy: So, right.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:23.840
This is like bureaucratic
fieldwork on stage.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.140
[ Laughter ]

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:29.320
But I wanted to start with Alan,
you know, I'm looking at the date

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:38.480
of January 2nd, 1976 as the
birth date of the Center.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:42.720
And I know for many of us in
the room here, we have worked

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:47.620
in government, federal, state
counties, city government,

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:51.030
trying to create programs
and that's difficult, right?

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:55.850
And so January 2nd is
obviously maybe the birth date,

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:59.290
but this whole process started
a long time before that.

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:01.140
I know that you are involved

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:03.910
in starting the first state
folklife programs while you were

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:06.440
at the NEA in 1974.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:11.430
And, you know, when I look at that
time period in American history--

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:15.790
that was a difficult stretch
of time for the nation

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:19.860 position:56%
and particularly for the government.

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:24.170
And, you know, at any
moment in history,

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:26.190
I think we think we're
in a unique time, right?

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:30.430
And so here we are at this
particularly interesting period

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:33.560
of American political
and cultural history.

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:38.720
There's a lot of churn and
a lot of anxiety and I think

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:43.600
that this Center was created at a
similar moment in American history.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:49.880
And so I'm curious to know how
that felt as the new director

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:55.190
of the Center in terms of the
conversations that you were having

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:56.610
with the general public,

00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:00.450
with government agencies
about why this mattered?

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:01.990
Why-- You know, why
did we need this?

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:05.120
How could this be a unifying force?

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:08.810
How did this gain political capital
to happen in the first place?

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:11.990
Obviously, it must have
been seen as necessary.

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:17.540
&gt;&gt; Alan Jabbour: Well, if it was
necessary, we all thought so,

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:20.000
but the world didn't think so.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.930
And on the other hand, people like
Archie Green did help Congress

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:31.720
to think so and it did pass and,
I guess at the very end of '75,

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:36.250
at the end of that session
of Congress and it was

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:43.900
at turbulent times but it also
was a time where we were the last

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:49.540 position:56%
of a series of Congressional
actions that we're cultural actions,

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:54.630
you know, including the creation
of the two Endowments in the '60s;

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:59.590
the creation of the Historic
Preservation programs.

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:04.190
Archie said he keep running in
to the historic preservation guy

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:07.240
who was lobbying Congress,
too, when he was lobbying

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:10.830
and they got acquainted
with each other that way.

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:17.810
And so, we were at the tail
end of that and no big ones,

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:20.100
that I can think of, followed us.

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:25.650
And on the other hand, I
don't think there was--

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:28.330
plenty of people of course said,
"Well, what's that going to be?"

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:29.650
is the policemen.

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:34.280
And in our field, there was
maybe some anxiety about like,

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:36.010
well, what's it going to do?

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:39.950
We've already got grants
from the Arts Endowment,

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:43.960 position:56%
we didn't have grants from the
Humanities Endowment or at least not

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:49.000
on any focal and concerted
way, so there was a challenge.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.730
And we had a great program
over at the Smithsonian,

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:57.270
that was a festival plus, you know,

00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:02.760
because the Festival itself
had become a defining activity

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:07.390
on the national landscape--
literally and figuratively,

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:15.420
and the program itself, of course,
grew beyond the Festival alone.

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:18.490
And so some people might
have wondered, well,

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:22.090
what's the Folklife Center
going to do, you know?

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:25.390
And a number of people
in our field said, "Well,

00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:27.500
you can be coordinative."

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:34.490 position:56%
Coordinative?-- Coordination is an
important thing and I believe in it,

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:39.720
but if that's your only job, you're
not going to be able to get anybody

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.970 position:56%
to pay attention, in my opinion, so.

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:47.930
And so you need some other things
to have attention, you know,

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:51.160
and then you can coordinate
more effectively

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:55.840
or so I believed as
the new director.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:59.340
And plus we had to reassure
the Library of Congress

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:04.260
which accepted the Folklife Center
that possibly with some misgivings,

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:09.240 position:56%
you know, reassure them that we fit.

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:15.780
And so, I then launched
a program focusing

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:21.500
on field documentation
evoking as history

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:26.890 position:56%
of the archive going all the way
back to the '30s, well, to the '20s,

00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:31.560
really, with Robert W. Gordon.

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.940
And evoking that is our
tradition, you know,

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:36.970
which we're now reawakening.

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:40.500
And so we started doing
field documentation,

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:44.780
but it wasn't-most field
documentation in our field

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:52.680 position:56%
of folklore at that time was solo
work, maybe occasionally two people,

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:55.730
but usually people working alone.

00:12:55.730 --> 00:13:00.780
And I was greatly taken by,
you know, the other fields

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:07.090
who had mounted collective projects
of a number of professionals

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:12.320
with varying skills, even from
different fields: anthropology

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:15.160
or archeology and so forth.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:18.190
And I thought, "Well,
we should do that too."

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:24.150
Luckily, our field itself, which
had started out focusing mainly

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:30.370
on verbal, oral traditions
and had added music very early

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:36.320
in the game had started adding
in a serious way material culture

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:42.540
to verbal and musical traditions
as what we as folklorists did.

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:50.940 position:56%
And so, documenting material
culture as well demanded photography

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:54.640
and other media of documentation.

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:58.330
Plus, documentation
reassured the Library

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:00.660
that we were building
collections, you know.

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:05.510
We were creating collections
which was what the Library thinks

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:09.490
of itself as doing either
creating collections

00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:12.130
or at least assembling
the collections

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:14.300
that others have created.

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:19.270
The Archive historically had
done both, but had done both

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:22.790
at a sort of a small gauge level.

00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:27.510
Even at that level, Alan Lomax
figured out with his dad how

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:32.030
to make a lot of people
notice it and think about it.

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:34.670
And so, think of the possibilities

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:39.210
if we did larger projects
including professionals

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:43.240
of all persuasions and specialties.

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:50.560
Truly documenting folklife and
in fact-- defining folklife,

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:55.770
not just by what we said, but by
what we did in our documentation.

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:57.210
Maybe I better stop there.

00:14:57.210 --> 00:14:58.510 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Cliff Murphy: Well, I-- you know,

00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:02.780 position:56%
I want to ask you one quick personal
question before we maybe start

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:05.620
to spread out a little bit and
I've reminded our panelists here

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:08.240
that they should feel free to
ask one another questions, too,

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:11.600
because I feel like that
would be interesting.

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:15.940
Do you remember your
first day on the job?

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:18.550
&gt;&gt; Alan Jabbour: Actually--

00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:19.850
&gt;&gt; Cliff Murphy: What
did it feel like walking

00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:21.150
in the door and here I am?

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:24.880
&gt;&gt; Alan Jabbour: Actually, the-- I
do remember it but it was an odd,

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:29.750
lonely day because they didn't
even know where to put me.

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:36.220
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: Some
things never change, Alan.

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:37.520
&gt;&gt; Alan Jabbour: Yeah, right.

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:38.820
[ Laughter ]

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:40.120
And so, the big question

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:41.420
on the first day is,
where will your seat be?

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:42.720
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: Yeah.

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:45.140
&gt;&gt; Alan Jabbour: I couldn't even
yet quite called at in the office,

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:52.390
but there was a small budget, as
well as me and this was August

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:55.490
or September, it was
the end of the--

00:15:55.490 --> 00:16:00.350
what was then the fiscal year
that ended September 30th.

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:04.700
And so, the small budget, well,
what do you do with a small budget

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:08.130
when you're just you
don't even have an office?

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:13.770
So, you-- maybe you could hire
people and I got busy hiring,

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:18.310
but there, that takes
dealing with the bureaucracy

00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:23.980
which said there's no such thing as
a "folklife specialist," you know.

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:28.410
And so we had to invent
categories for the personnel world.

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:37.200
So, the one other thing we could
do is buy documentary equipment.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:43.660
And my vision of what we should
do was embedded on how I spend

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:47.220
that small budget, you
know, in the waning days

00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:51.020
of fiscal year, whatever
it was, '77?

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:52.320
&gt;&gt; Cliff Murphy: That sounds

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:55.030
like a good government
worker right there, right?

00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:59.410
&gt;&gt; Alan Jabbour: And also, by doing
that to define what we were going

00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:03.670
to do and where we
were going to go, so.

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:06.550 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Cliff Murphy: Well, so, I'm
going to try to segue to Peggy here.

00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:10.570
I know from reading your
correspondence with George Carey

00:17:10.570 --> 00:17:14.390
in Maryland in the creation of
that state folklife program there

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:19.720
in the early '70s that you
had some vision of the study

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:23.280
of folklife including many
things that we think of as being

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:27.590
in the humanities-- vernacular
architecture, for instance.

00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:31.510
Peggy, I know that when
you came onboard here

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:35.160
that you began working a lot
with occupational folklife

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:36.460
and these sorts of things.

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:41.860
So tell me a little bit
about inheriting this program

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:44.120
in this Center and this mission.

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:47.470
What did that feel
like as you stepped in

00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:51.650
and where did you want
to go with it?

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:52.950 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: Well, first of all,

00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:54.540
I have to say it was
really daunting.

00:17:54.540 --> 00:18:00.250
I remember founding out that I
got the job and I was floored.

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:05.600
But I have to say that anything I'm
saying really any accomplishments

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.060
really it's the staff.

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:10.180
I mean, I inherited
a wonderful staff.

00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:15.700
Unfortunately, we were going
through a terrible time fiscally.

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:17.640
We needed to fill positions.

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:20.240
We had people still on
the books who were dead.

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:21.830
I'm not kidding, you know.

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:26.690
And so we really needed-- we
needed to gear up a little.

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:28.490
They were pulling their weight.

00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:31.020
[ Laughter ]

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:32.750
Remember that?

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:36.420
So anyway, and I mean, Alan's
right, some things never change.

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:40.030
Yeah, I came, there
was no chair for me

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:41.670
because Alan was still working so--

00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:42.970
[ Laughter ]

00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:45.720
So either I had to push
him out of the chair,

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:48.330
which I think I did, I
may have just stayed--

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:50.650
&gt;&gt; Alan Jabbour: And they
put me up in the rafters--

00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:51.950
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: In the rafters...

00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:53.250
&gt;&gt; Alan Jabbour: -- above
the Main Reading Room.

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:54.550
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: Yeah.

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:55.850
&gt;&gt; Alan Jabbour: I had
really a glorious seat.

00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:57.150
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: Yeah.

00:18:57.150 --> 00:19:00.050
But when I came, I think, you
know, you got to realize there's

00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:04.710
such a difference between 1976
and 1999 in the field of folklore.

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:06.500
I mean, it's like night and day.

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:12.210 position:56%
And mainly because the good works
that had been done since '76 to '99,

00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:15.680
we now had a network of
folklorists around the country

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:19.600
who are doing those field projects,
using, I think, probably Alan

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:26.020
and his staff and the big
documentation projects as a model,

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:28.000
which was great because, you know,

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.870
here are all these new
programs being established.

00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:32.170
I was in one of them.

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:33.470
I was in Florida.

00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:36.060
I guess I was the sixth
state folklorist

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:38.760
and we would borrow
the Nagras all the time

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:43.310 position:56%
and that was another thing I came
and there's a bunch of unused Nagras

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:44.610
that were, you know,
all of a sudden,

00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:45.910
everybody has their own equipment.

00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:51.560
So you have to re-- we were
rethinking what the Center might do

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:53.320
that nobody else could do.

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:59.120
Because there is no reason to, I
guess re-- not reinvent the wheel,

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:02.240
but continue with the
same wheel when it--

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:07.010
you are so successful that
everybody was doing great out there

00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:09.930
and what could the Center do?

00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:14.160
So I-- I guess when I
came, my first problem

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:18.670 position:56%
and I think it's probably an ongoing
thing, you're always fighting

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:22.550
for the Folklife Center, whether
it's with the library or Congress

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:25.630
or whatever, you're
fighting for resources.

00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:29.330
And as a director, I
really knew that what I had

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:33.140
to do was get enough resources
so the staff could do their job.

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:34.440
Because there's a great staff,

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:36.540
but if you don't have
resources, you can't do anything.

00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:41.690
And so, we were able to hire--
I think we doubled our staff.

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:42.990
&gt;&gt; Alan Jabbour: Yes.

00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:45.950
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: And-- But I-- you
know, we all had to fight for it.

00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:50.690
And we started thinking
about where we were.

00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:54.820
Well, in the field also,
let's face it, you know,

00:20:54.820 --> 00:21:00.380
public folklore now had a
35-year trajectory and all

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:04.200 position:56%
of those collections are out there:
1, you know, when the state would go

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:09.210
out a business, you know, when they
would have their folklife program

00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:12.710
collapse, where did
that material go?

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:15.860
And unfortunately, a lot of
times, it goes into the basement

00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:19.620
of some state archive where it
was, you know, moldering a way.

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:20.920
So we--

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:22.220
&gt;&gt; Cliff Murphy: I've seen that.

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:23.940
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: Yeah,
I bet you have.

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:26.530
So, we were thinking about that.

00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:30.580
Of course, we were in the process
of finalizing and we did, you know,

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:33.610
the Alan Lomax Collection
coming here which, you know,

00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:37.380
started with Alan and
continued and that was a huge--

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:42.460
to have Lomax Collection come, I
think gave us a big shot in the arm

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:47.020
as far as everybody saying: "Oh,
well, maybe I want my stuff to be

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:49.400
over there, because
it's Alan Lomax."

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:52.970
And so we started getting
interest from some of the scholars

00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:56.880
who are ready to retire and they,
you know, their house was full

00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:00.740
of stuff and they realized we've
got to do something with it.

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:06.580
So we were able to really, I
think, put an emphasis now not

00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:09.410
on field projects anymore, in
fact, we didn't have any money

00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:14.270
to do field projects and the
other thing was we really thought

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:19.030
that what we had in the
archives was so important,

00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:26.570
it needed to be preserved better
and get more staff to process it

00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:28.720
and then to get the collections.

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:32.370
So I think in the first
five years when I was here,

00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:35.190 position:56%
we tripled the archive, the numbers.

00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:38.240
But now I just said,
it's now like within--

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:41.350
I've only been gone four years,
you already got a million more.

00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:42.650
You go, girl!

00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:43.950
[ Laughter ]

00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:45.250
You go girl.

00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:48.000
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: Oh I think we're
just accurately counting that.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.300
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: You
know, that could be.

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:50.600
That could be.

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:51.900
It's all those files I left.

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:53.410
&gt;&gt; Alan Jabbour: Can I tell about--

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:54.710
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:57.130
&gt;&gt; Alan Jabbour: -- a quick
Peggy-related anecdote?

00:22:57.130 --> 00:23:04.110
When I was retiring from the
Center, I persuaded the Library

00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:10.060
that I could help facilitate the
transition to the new director

00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:16.050
and so I was going to hang on if
they could find a place to put me.

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:17.350
[ Laughter ]

00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:21.760
But I talked to a bunch of
colleagues and got, you know,

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:26.210
they made it clear to me that
I wasn't going to get to choose

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:30.160
which horse it would be, but then
I thought, well, then the trick is

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:32.490
to get good horses in the race.

00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:33.830
And so--

00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:35.130
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: That's right.

00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:37.990
&gt;&gt; Alan Jabbour: -- the personnel
office, at some point, contacted me

00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:40.780
and said, "Well, we've got
a number of applications,"

00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:42.640
and they read off the names.

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:43.990
And I said, "Oh, that's great.

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:45.320
Oh, you got it.

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:47.310
Oh, he came too."

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:53.400
And then I realized it was all
men, all the strong candidates.

00:23:53.400 --> 00:24:01.080
And so-- though I didn't get Peggy
her job, she got herself the job,

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:04.230
I got her to apply
and I'm proud of that.

00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:05.530
And--

00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:06.830
[ Laughter and Applause ]

00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:08.150
And she did the rest, you know.

00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:09.450
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: Sure.

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:13.270
You really convince me
when you said, "Well,

00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:16.650
if you don't get the job, you'll
get a free weekend in Washington."

00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:17.950
[ Laughter ]

00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:19.420
That sounded good to me.

00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:22.950
&gt;&gt; Cliff Murphy: That was a trip
that worked out well, right?

00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:24.670
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: Yeah,
yeah, very great, yeah.

00:24:24.670 --> 00:24:31.050 position:56%
Anyway, so in a nutshell, though, I
think each, you know, you could look

00:24:31.050 --> 00:24:35.780
at each decade, really, and the
way that the field has grown,

00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:40.260
the Center, I think, needs to
respond to what's happening.

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:42.320 position:56%
And the other thing I have to say is

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:49.430
that we were navigating digital
collections for the first time

00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:55.140
and had to really fight for certain
things, like our Facebook page.

00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:58.750
I remember Dr. Billington
being outraged that we wanted

00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:01.850
to have a Facebook page,
you know, this was, "No, no,

00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:03.230
we couldn't have a Facebook page."

00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:07.290
And so, needless to say,
thanks to Steve Winick,

00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:10.050
we have a great Facebook
page to this day,

00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:14.850
but it took a long time to-- you
know, the Library is a big old ship

00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:19.060
that really-- you know, it's
a great ship but it is--

00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:22.530
it's not very nimble
on its feet, ever.

00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:24.800
[ Laughter ]

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:26.660
&gt;&gt; Cliff Murphy: Well, now
as the Thomas Jefferson

00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:29.390
of the presidential sequence--

00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:30.690
[ Laughter ]

00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:32.820
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: Good one.

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:34.120
&gt;&gt; Cliff Murphy: Thank you.

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:36.770
Though Adams was only
there very briefly,

00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:40.310
I'm not saying it was
long illustrious.

00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:41.610
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: Yeah.

00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:44.780
&gt;&gt; Cliff Murphy: Tell me how
was that experience, you know,

00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:50.850 position:56%
coming into a position where, you
know, you are preceded by two people

00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:56.580
with significant stature
in the field and to kind

00:25:56.580 --> 00:26:00.890
of take those reins, how
did that feel and what--

00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:03.690
where are we now, you know?

00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:04.990
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: You tell me.

00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:06.290
[ Laughter ]

00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:10.330
No, I called Peggy on my-- the
end of my first day on the job

00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:14.820
and started in more colorful
language and said, "What the--

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:17.560
How did I get myself into this?"

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:21.130 position:56%
But, no, it's been wonderful and I--

00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:26.510
right now, we are in the midst
of digitizing some collections

00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:31.550
that go back to Alan's time,
the field surveys that started

00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:35.360
in the '70s and I'm just
getting reacquainted

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:36.960
with all of that material now.

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:43.350
I'm just in awe and amazed
at what the staff was able

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:45.350
to accomplish in the '70s.

00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:49.340
And also continually reminded
now that just the changes

00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:54.220 position:56%
that are happening; the changes that
Peggy, I think, begins to describe

00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:59.210
which I think do mirror the
changes and the maturation

00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:02.240
or trajectory of the
field as a whole.

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:10.400
And I do think that Alan and the
first generation really focused

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:13.290
on doing a lot of documentation,
going out

00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:18.910 position:56%
and actively creating material for
the archive that really did, I mean,

00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:23.810
continue with tradition, a long
very illustrious tradition of Lomax

00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:28.720
and Botkin and Gordon and everyone.

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:32.610
And I think when Peggy
and I began to come along

00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:37.010
and I think it's just really-- it
sort of an acceleration with me,

00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:42.600
is that the shift from going
out and actually doing the work

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:47.000 position:56%
to eliciting the work, I think,
began to happen and I think it began

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.040
to happen for a few reasons.

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:56.960 position:56%
Money being one, and I came in
after the recession and all of that,

00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:01.240
and also faced a lot of
shrinking budgets as well.

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:11.450
But I think, you know, as I came
along, it also was about the issue

00:28:11.450 --> 00:28:14.440
of whose-- who owns culture,

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:17.520
who speaks for culture,
who does field work?

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:21.720
And I think it sort of
points to the benefits

00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:23.830
and the limitations
of federal government.

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:26.090
I think we can do certain things.

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:32.750
But I think for our field and that
I think for me at a certain point,

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:37.710
it does become an issue
of, does somebody going out

00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:41.330
and doing fieldwork in a community
they don't really know very well,

00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:45.080
ultimately, and may not
be staying for very long,

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:49.160
or how effective are they going
to be versus someone who lives

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:52.770
and grows up in a particular
community and has expertise?

00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:56.900
And I think also as our field grew,
there are more and more people

00:28:56.900 --> 00:29:01.040
with equipment, more and more
people who can do field research,

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:03.850
more and more folklorists
ethnomusicologists,

00:29:03.850 --> 00:29:09.830
cultural anthropologists, and oral
historians and on and on and on.

00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:14.540
So, I mean, we have an
incredible array of people all

00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:19.320
over the country, all over the
world, that we can work with now.

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:21.380
And it was interesting,

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:26.300
we just finish the board meeting
this morning and we talked

00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:31.530
about fellowships and
it's interesting: I--

00:29:31.530 --> 00:29:35.360
when I did my dissertation,
I did my dissertation totally

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:39.420
with field equipment borrowed
from the American Folklife Center,

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:42.300
with Nagras borrowed from Carl.

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:47.960
And that was an incredible strategy
at that point when equipment was

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:52.890
so expensive that nobody
could have access to that kind

00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:56.690
of professional recording equipment
without a program like that.

00:29:56.690 --> 00:29:58.690
So it was unbelievable.

00:29:58.690 --> 00:30:02.120
It really helped a
generation of people I think.

00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:05.850
In the same way now that I think
the Archie Green Fellowships,

00:30:05.850 --> 00:30:10.930 position:56%
which started under Peggy, and other
fellowship programs, the Parsons,

00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:16.070
the Reed, which Alan
started, and Blanton Owen.

00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:20.500
Those are, I think, more
appropriate strategies for now.

00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:24.810
They are encouraging fieldwork,
they are encouraging people to go

00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:31.770 position:56%
out into communities and do extended
serious in-depth field research

00:30:31.770 --> 00:30:35.350
in a way that we couldn't do.

00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:36.960
We just wouldn't be able to do it.

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:39.870
The money is not there,
the resources aren't there.

00:30:39.870 --> 00:30:42.860
And I think those are
kinds of strategies.

00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:48.110
I do think that's one of the
differences between the beginnings

00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:53.350
of the Center and where
we are now in 2016.

00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:58.830
I also think, for me, Peggy
mentioned digitalization and,

00:30:58.830 --> 00:31:01.360
you know, digital media
and it certainly--

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:05.400
that shift was happening
under Peggy.

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:11.910
It's only accelerated, you know, at
warp speed now,and that actually,

00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:18.300 position:56%
for us or for me, one of the central
issues or thrusts that I think

00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:22.390
or directions the Center
has to take is

00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:25.210
to really aggressively
digitize its material,

00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:29.810
to really aggressively get it
up online and get it available

00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:31.980
and that means several things.

00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:34.880
I mean, just digitizing something
doesn't make it available.

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:40.540 position:56%
There's a whole bunch of other steps
and work that has to go into that.

00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:43.650
And I'm committed;
the staff is committed

00:31:43.650 --> 00:31:49.010
to really moving very
actively in that direction.

00:31:49.010 --> 00:31:52.790
We have so much material that
you either have to come here

00:31:52.790 --> 00:31:55.870
or it's really not all
that accessible, period.

00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:59.250
And that's-- I mean, it's a shame.

00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:03.440
It's-- We brought all this
unbelievable material in,

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:06.330
now we've got to, we've
got to get it out--

00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:07.630
&gt;&gt; Cliff Murphy: Right.

00:32:07.630 --> 00:32:08.930
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: -- and
let people see what we have.

00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:12.410
I mean that's one of the
major missions we have.

00:32:12.410 --> 00:32:14.950
We also will continue
and do continue

00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:17.280
to bring in new collections.

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:22.940
As Peggy mentioned, again, many
scholars, nonprofit organizations

00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:28.730 position:56%
who are a major engine for field
research in this country in the '70s

00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:32.690
and '80s, many of them are
beginning to, you know,

00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:35.440
looking at these collections
and realizing, "Gee,

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:36.960
we have masked all sorts of stuff.

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:38.450
What are we going to do with it?"

00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:40.520
and nobody can get to it.

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:44.790
So, we are beginning to actively
work with those organizations

00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:49.980 position:56%
as well and I think those will also
continue to just enrich the archive.

00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:54.000
But those are some of, I
think, the trajectory or some

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.140
of the differences that I see.

00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:57.440
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: Yeah.

00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:58.850
Well, the NCTA [National Council
for Traditional Arts] collection.

00:32:58.850 --> 00:33:01.860
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: Yeah, yeah, and
the Center for Traditional Music

00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:06.650
and Dance that actually
just came to us last year.

00:33:06.650 --> 00:33:11.360
&gt;&gt; Cliff Murphy: So, I'm struck by,
you know, all three of you started

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:13.980
out your careers in
the field, right?

00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:17.360 position:56%
You each done the significant amount
of fieldwork, important fieldwork,

00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:22.430
and in time, you were
sucked into desk work--

00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:23.730
[ Laughter ]

00:33:23.730 --> 00:33:27.040
-- in a rather significant
way, right?

00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:31.450
And I know that in the kind of the
day-to-day administrative work of--

00:33:31.450 --> 00:33:36.150 position:56%
in an organization like the
American Folklife Center or program,

00:33:36.150 --> 00:33:38.700
there's a lot to manage, right?

00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:44.600
And what-- I imagine that along
the way, there must be moments

00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:48.160
that you say, "This is
why we do this," right?

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:52.140
And are there moments that come
to mind where you, you know,

00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:57.400 position:56%
that crystalize the mission and the
purpose of this work that, you know,

00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:00.510
that you can kind of
look back and reflect on?

00:34:00.510 --> 00:34:01.810
Are there?

00:34:01.810 --> 00:34:03.110
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: Do
you want to start?

00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:07.930
&gt;&gt; Alan Jabbour: Well, many
moments, it's hard to pick one out.

00:34:07.930 --> 00:34:14.530
At the public level, you know,
some of the accomplishments

00:34:14.530 --> 00:34:22.040
in our era included luring
Rosalynn Carter, you know,

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:27.780
to an exhibit we had at the library
with Amy Carter and, you know,

00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:30.570
it's nice getting the
president's wife looking at--

00:34:30.570 --> 00:34:32.540
&gt;&gt; Cliff Murphy: Were
they in the Carter family?

00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:34.820
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: Yeah,
the Carter family.

00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:37.310
&gt;&gt; Alan Jabbour: We didn't
get the whole Carter family.

00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:38.610
[ Laughter ]

00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:41.630
And then, when we did our
American Cowboy exhibit,

00:34:41.630 --> 00:34:46.340
we got President Reagan to
come to bless it as it were

00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:50.100
in the big reception
and the opening.

00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:57.540
And so, in terms of our public
visibility and the reassurance

00:34:57.540 --> 00:35:02.470
that that gave the institution
that we were on the right track,

00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:05.130
you know, those were high moments.

00:35:05.130 --> 00:35:10.500
Field moments, of course,
I picture in the field.

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:13.970
I didn't get to really do
fieldwork in our field projects,

00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:19.220 position:56%
I was already the desk guy, but they
let me come and sniff, you know,

00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:24.570
at the beginning and maybe
in the middle ones, you know.

00:35:24.570 --> 00:35:30.670 position:56%
And so I went down to South Georgia
when we were doing our project there

00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:33.920
and couldn't resist asking around,

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:36.720
"are there any fiddlers
around here," you know?

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:41.270
And sure enough, we got
directed and Carl and I went

00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:50.850
down to visit a fiddler, John R.
Griffin, in Lenox, Georgia and one

00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:57.810
of my magic moments oddly is
with me playing the fiddle

00:35:57.810 --> 00:36:02.500
like we were recording him playing
the fiddle, but he also knew how

00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:05.940
to beat the straws and he
didn't do it with two straws,

00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:08.350
he did it with just
one straw beating

00:36:08.350 --> 00:36:13.520
on the strings while the
fiddle was being played.

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:17.040
I can't-- I don't enough time to
explain how you can beat the straw

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:22.020
when it's just one straw, but
it can be done and he did it.

00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:26.470
And to demonstrate it, of course,
I had to play the fiddle and,

00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:28.620
of course, Carl was documenting it.

00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:32.840
And so, there are wonderful
photos of me fiddling.

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:40.450
John R. Griffin beating a straw on
the fiddle and on his front porch

00:36:40.450 --> 00:36:43.130
and to me, that's fieldwork

00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:47.360
and since I'm a fieldwork
man-- that sums me up.

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:49.900
But it's kind of bit of an
untruth because it suggests

00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:54.560
that I was busy doing fieldwork
myself at the Folklife Center,

00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:59.440
whereas a lot of the work was
fighting what people about budgets

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:06.190
and congressional hearings
and staff issues, personnel-

00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:07.490
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: Yeah.

00:37:07.490 --> 00:37:08.790
&gt;&gt; Alan Jabbour: --
issues, you know--

00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:10.090
&gt;&gt; Cliff Murphy: Right.

00:37:10.090 --> 00:37:12.680
&gt;&gt; Alan Jabbour: -- all the
things that bureaucrats need to do

00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:14.880
and which we happily did,

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:18.790
but we can't claim it was
fun and remember them.

00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:20.090
&gt;&gt; Cliff Murphy: Right.

00:37:20.090 --> 00:37:21.390
How about for you, Peggy?

00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:22.950
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: Well, you
know, I'm thinking about this.

00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:27.510
I think some of the best moments
were also some of the worst.

00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:31.100
So, you know, I think about one
of the things that happened early

00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:34.700
on when I came, Barry Bergey
and I were asked to go

00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:37.180
to a conference in Beijing.

00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:40.110
It was the very first conference
on intellectual property

00:37:40.110 --> 00:37:42.320
as it pertained to folklore.

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:51.530
And we were representing the United
States and it began a trajectory

00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:55.680
that I realized the
American Folklife Center,

00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:59.680
which sits it an institution
that has the Copyright Office,

00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:02.090
needed to be at the table when--

00:38:02.090 --> 00:38:05.970
I couldn't believe that there
were people out there at the WIPO,

00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:07.830
World Intellectual
Property Organization,

00:38:07.830 --> 00:38:12.370
who are debating these
cultural issues and none

00:38:12.370 --> 00:38:15.000
of them were called--
they were all lawyers.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.690
They were either patent
lawyers or copyright lawyers.

00:38:17.690 --> 00:38:21.530
There were very few and certainly
on the American delegation,

00:38:21.530 --> 00:38:23.890
there were no "content experts."

00:38:23.890 --> 00:38:28.260
And so, I became one of the
first content experts and sat

00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:33.230
through agonizing,
agonizing meetings.

00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:38.670
But it the end, I think it was very
important because if nothing else,

00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:43.150
we were able to do a project with
Tom Rankin and Guha [Shankar] went

00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:46.870
to Kenya working with people

00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:50.130
who document their
own cultural tradition

00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:53.150
so that they could maintain control

00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:56.600
over what was happening
to their lives.

00:38:56.600 --> 00:39:00.610 position:56%
And even though we don't really know
whether that was very, you know,

00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:05.340
ultimately long-term successful--
where it was successful,

00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:11.300
they still talk about that
project in Geneva at these meetings

00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:15.640
where they're talking about who
owns culture, you know, and I mean,

00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:18.670
I could get into some really funny
stories about the discussions,

00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:24.420
but I think it was very
important that a folklorist be

00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:26.220
on the American delegation.

00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:27.520
&gt;&gt; Alan Jabbour: Yes.

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:28.820
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: I mean, you know,

00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:31.820
it was surprising to
me that we weren't.

00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:33.120
&gt;&gt; Cliff Murphy: Yeah.

00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:36.150
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: So that
work continues on along

00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:39.350
with all the work that's going
on with UNESCO and there's a lot

00:39:39.350 --> 00:39:42.350 position:56%
of overlap between what's happening.

00:39:42.350 --> 00:39:44.650
But, I think that that was one

00:39:44.650 --> 00:39:47.800 position:56%
of the things I said that's what the
American Folklife Center could do

00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:52.550
that somebody at the state level
or a local level would not have

00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:54.550 position:56%
to gravitas, you know, "I'm in the--

00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:57.220
I represent the federal
government," you know.

00:39:57.220 --> 00:40:01.680
So, it was tough but
I actually enjoyed it.

00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:03.680
You know, that's my weirdness.

00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:06.460
&gt;&gt; Cliff Murphy: That's great.

00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:09.680
And Betsy, how about
you or is it too soon?

00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:10.980
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: Well--

00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:12.280
[ Laughter ]

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:14.850
it's-- well, it's interesting.

00:40:14.850 --> 00:40:20.920
I mean, one of the reasons that I
really wanted to do this job was

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:27.710 position:56%
that I knew that we are in the midst
of a massive generational shift

00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:33.440
in the field, and just, well, every
which way you can think of, we are.

00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:36.390
And for me, that was one
of the exciting things,

00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:42.050
to be able to be participating
that, to be able to work,

00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:46.950
and if any small way, you
know, have a voice in talking

00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:52.490
about where this field, this Center
would go and that was exciting

00:40:52.490 --> 00:40:56.450
to me, sort of more
three-dimensional

00:40:56.450 --> 00:41:00.170
and I guess more organizational
sort of way.

00:41:00.170 --> 00:41:03.750
I mean, by the time I came here and
I came here much later in my life

00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:10.100
than Alan or Peggy, and so,
which is probably a good idea

00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:12.790
because it would have been
much more difficult, I think,

00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:17.570
and I wouldn't have
had the patience,

00:41:17.570 --> 00:41:20.810
because things do not
move much more slowly.

00:41:20.810 --> 00:41:26.290
But I think being able
to get new staff,

00:41:26.290 --> 00:41:29.870
be able to begin thinking
about, for instance,

00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:35.410 position:56%
working with the federal cylinders,
I mean, the Federal Cylinder Project

00:41:35.410 --> 00:41:40.020
and begin to reimagine what that
might be in the 21st century,

00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:42.090
and that is really exciting.

00:41:42.090 --> 00:41:47.400
And I should also say that for me
and in large part because of Alan

00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:53.730
and then Peggy, I think Alan
really had to face a lot of fights

00:41:53.730 --> 00:41:56.980
with the library, with-- I
mean, all the authorization

00:41:56.980 --> 00:41:59.040
and reauthorization fights.

00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:04.220
I didn't have to do that and
Peggy barely had to do that.

00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:08.520
And that actually, I think,
made a big difference.

00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:14.430
I also think, for me, I
actually feel pretty supported

00:42:14.430 --> 00:42:16.350
by the library administration.

00:42:16.350 --> 00:42:21.840
We do have to fight for resources
as every other division does,

00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:28.020
but I actually feel that they're--
we're in pretty good shape compared

00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:30.460
to some of the other
divisions here in the library.

00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:34.960 position:56%
And I think they actually do, at
least in the current administration,

00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:38.480
really, I think, values what
we do and what we bring.

00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:42.210
And with seeing with the
Veterans History Project,

00:42:42.210 --> 00:42:48.360
I do think we are sort of hybrid
divisions, we are actively,

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:53.470
you know, bringing in material,
actively soliciting material

00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:57.970
and still doing field
research as well,

00:42:57.970 --> 00:43:03.270
unlike a lot of other divisions
who are primarily dealing

00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:05.600
with books, serials and the like.

00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:08.710
So we're-- And we're
actively doing programming.

00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:12.240
We're not just the
collections division,

00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:14.760
we're also a programming division.

00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:17.360
And we're also trying to
move more aggressively

00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:20.670
and to work with digital media.

00:43:20.670 --> 00:43:25.990
And I think we're sort of showing
the way, actually, for the Library.

00:43:25.990 --> 00:43:29.400
And I think the Library
kind of knows that.

00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:33.140
&gt;&gt; Alan Jabbour: Yeah,
we're like an R&amp;D outfit--

00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:34.440
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: Yeah.

00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:35.740
&gt;&gt; Alan Jabbour: -- for
the Library of Congress.

00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:37.040
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: No, we are.

00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:38.340
We are.

00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:39.640
&gt;&gt; Alan Jabbour: And it have
been actually for a good while.

00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:40.940
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: Yeah.

00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:42.240
&gt;&gt; Alan Jabbour: You
know, Carl [Fleischhauer]

00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:43.540
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: Yeah.

00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:44.840
&gt;&gt; Alan Jabbour: -- was really--

00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:46.140
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: No,
yeah, from the beginning.

00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:47.440
&gt;&gt; Alan Jabbour: -- one of
the first people to experiment

00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:48.740 position:56%
with the possibilities of digitizing
collections to share them, you know.

00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:50.040
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson:
No, and that's true.

00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:51.340
Actually--

00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:52.640
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: Yeah.

00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:53.940
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: -- one
of the Associate Librarian

00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:57.430
in our board meeting we've just
finished was talking about how,

00:43:57.430 --> 00:44:03.200
I think, the AFC has always been
recognized as trying to be or being

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:06.760
on the cutting edge of
technology and trying to grapple

00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:10.240
with technology in the
work that we do and then

00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:13.100
from Carl and Alan on up to now.

00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:17.000
I think that has continued
to be the case.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.430
&gt;&gt; Cliff Murphy: Well, I
should say I'm thinking about--

00:44:20.430 --> 00:44:22.340
I'm looking into the audience here

00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:24.290
and I know people have
some questions.

00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:28.040
I'm also struck by-- I
know that I see Cathy Kerst

00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:31.080
and Carl Fleischhauer
and there may be others

00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:33.770
who have worked for
all three of you.

00:44:33.770 --> 00:44:35.070
So--

00:44:35.070 --> 00:44:36.370
&gt;&gt; Alan Jabbour: And
Judith [Gray] back there.

00:44:36.370 --> 00:44:37.670
&gt;&gt; Cliff Murphy: Yes.

00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:38.970
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: We'll do this.

00:44:38.970 --> 00:44:40.270
&gt;&gt; Cliff Murphy: Right.

00:44:40.270 --> 00:44:41.570
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: Oh no.

00:44:41.570 --> 00:44:42.870
&gt;&gt; Cliff Murphy: Jennifer
[Cutting], right?

00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:44.900 position:56%
So, you have kind of collaboratively
assembled a staff over that time.

00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:47.130 position:56%
So, I do want to say congratulations

00:44:47.130 --> 00:44:49.440
on putting together an
extraordinary staff here

00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:59.900
at the American Folklife Center.

00:44:59.900 --> 00:45:01.200
[ Applause ]

00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:05.220
Now, before I turn you over to
your current and former staff

00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:11.690
for interrogation, do you have
questions for one another?

00:45:11.690 --> 00:45:14.890
Or maybe you do this
secretly over the phone?

00:45:14.890 --> 00:45:18.570
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: Well,
I'm-- a couple of questions.

00:45:18.570 --> 00:45:23.710
One, are there things that you
wanted to accomplish or things

00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:25.910
that you started that
were left undone

00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:29.570
that you would have
liked to have achieved?

00:45:29.570 --> 00:45:36.370
And to talk a little more about
the pros and cons of being

00:45:36.370 --> 00:45:39.110
in a federal agency and
trying to do what we do.

00:45:39.110 --> 00:45:42.520
I mean, for me, coming from
a background of working

00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:47.410
in nonprofits most
of my life, I've--

00:45:47.410 --> 00:45:51.080
well, I'm used to being having no
resources but I'm also was used

00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:58.030
to being more nimble and
flexible in what I was able to do,

00:45:58.030 --> 00:46:03.360
and to also be more-- you can be
a little bit more edgy when you're

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:06.470
in a nonprofit and
kind of pushing areas

00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:11.430
that for a federal agency is
more difficult and may not--

00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:15.580
I mean, may not be the role
of a federal agency that--

00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:21.320
and I'm just curious how you all
feel about those two questions.

00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:26.090
&gt;&gt; Alan Jabbour: Well, regarding
what I didn't accomplish

00:46:26.090 --> 00:46:30.670
and happily, Peggy
picked up where I left off

00:46:30.670 --> 00:46:35.760
on acquiring major collections
because that was one thing

00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:39.760
that I retired feeling
that I hadn't-- I--

00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:43.790
we had acquired collections
including some important cylinder

00:46:43.790 --> 00:46:46.200
collections, you know.

00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:49.670
And there, we acquired them
because we had somebody

00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:52.600
who could do something
with cylinders

00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:56.860
and most institutions
didn't, you know.

00:46:56.860 --> 00:46:59.840
So, that was helpful.

00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:04.690
But, Peggy picked up on the Alan
Lomax collection and in a way,

00:47:04.690 --> 00:47:09.890
I think, picked up on the idea of
shifting more energy and emphasis

00:47:09.890 --> 00:47:15.270
into collections acquisition
as a major thrust,

00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:19.660
which I think was the-- it
was the right moment for--

00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:21.220
and she did the right thing there.

00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:25.810
But it also bailed me
out on things like that.

00:47:25.810 --> 00:47:27.110
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: Yeah.

00:47:27.110 --> 00:47:29.860 position:56%
Well-- And I guess for me, actually,

00:47:29.860 --> 00:47:32.550
I really wish that
we could have sewn

00:47:32.550 --> 00:47:36.810
up that Seeger collection
while I was, you know,

00:47:36.810 --> 00:47:40.420
Pete and Toshi are
friends and it was just--

00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:41.720
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: Don't give up.

00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:43.020
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: Yeah,
I know, I know.

00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:45.270
I-- I always just wanted to--
I wish I could then, you know,

00:47:45.270 --> 00:47:48.150 position:56%
while I was still there to celebrate
while they were still alive,

00:47:48.150 --> 00:47:51.870
but some things don't
happen that way.

00:47:51.870 --> 00:47:56.890 position:56%
And I-- you know, there's always
things that you didn't get to finish

00:47:56.890 --> 00:48:01.600
but the good news is the Center
continues, just like Alan said.

00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:02.900
&gt;&gt; Alan Jabbour: Yeah.

00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:04.200
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: And so,
the things that are meant

00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:06.810
to be will continue
and they will get done.

00:48:06.810 --> 00:48:08.110
&gt;&gt; Alan Jabbour: Yes.

00:48:08.110 --> 00:48:11.500
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: It is-- And I
know I can just remember, you know,

00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:15.780
just trying to get-- I came from
the Southern Arts Federation here

00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:18.330
and even that, you know, that
was a nonprofit and just trying

00:48:18.330 --> 00:48:20.380 position:56%
to get a contract through could be--

00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:24.480
So, anything that we did
actually was a real accomplishment

00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:27.770
because we got through Napoleon
and whatever his name was

00:48:27.770 --> 00:48:30.240
over at the contracts
office, which was like--

00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:31.540
&gt;&gt; Alan Jabbour: Right,

00:48:31.540 --> 00:48:32.840
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: --
Napoleon and Lafayette.

00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:34.140
There were two men.

00:48:34.140 --> 00:48:35.440
&gt;&gt; Cliff Murphy: Really?

00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:37.330 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: Yes, I kid you not.

00:48:37.330 --> 00:48:38.630
I kid you not.

00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:41.900
&gt;&gt; Cliff Murphy: Was this when
the AFC was in Europe or--

00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:44.470
[ Laughter ]

00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:45.770
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: No.

00:48:45.770 --> 00:48:47.710
&gt;&gt; Cliff Murphy: So,
maybe this is a good point

00:48:47.710 --> 00:48:49.200 position:56%
to turn things over to the audience.

00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:55.390

imagine, brave souls, anyone?

Can I have a question?

00:48:58.370 --> 00:48:59.670

00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:00.970
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: Wow.

00:49:00.970 --> 00:49:02.880
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What happened
with state programs?

00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:04.180
[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:05.480
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: No,
wait for the mic.

00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:06.780
&gt;&gt; Jean Gilman: Hi, I'm Jean
Gilman [assumed spelling].

00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:09.920
I was on the board way back when
with Alan in the early days.

00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:11.300
It was wonderful.

00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:15.040
But what has gone on between
the American Folklife Center

00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:16.660
and the state level programs?

00:49:16.660 --> 00:49:19.790
Because my feeling was that they
were on the rise, that, you know,

00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:22.510
there was a point wherein
states were appointing their

00:49:22.510 --> 00:49:23.810
state folklorists.

00:49:23.810 --> 00:49:27.870
But in terms of the activities
of the Folklife Center

00:49:27.870 --> 00:49:30.590
and the state programs,
have you seen ups

00:49:30.590 --> 00:49:33.030
and downs in those relationships?

00:49:33.030 --> 00:49:37.410
Is that-- So maybe you
could address that?

00:49:37.410 --> 00:49:40.310
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: Well,
let me say something.

00:49:40.310 --> 00:49:46.180
Because I started my career as a
state folklorist in Florida in 1976

00:49:46.180 --> 00:49:51.190
when the Center was started and
if it wasn't for the Center,

00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:54.390
I don't know if the Florida
Folklife Program would be around

00:49:54.390 --> 00:49:58.190
but it's now, you know, alive
and well and continues on.

00:49:58.190 --> 00:50:02.920
I feel like the Center at the
time, and Betsy touched on this,

00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:04.220
was doing the right thing.

00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:07.560
We had the Nagras, thank God we
had the Nagras from the Library

00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:12.240
of Congress and we had
support and we could call

00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:17.610 position:56%
on our state legislature and say
there is an American Folklife Center

00:50:17.610 --> 00:50:21.620
at the Library of Congress and
they were floored, you know.

00:50:21.620 --> 00:50:23.550
They couldn't believe it, you know.

00:50:23.550 --> 00:50:25.250
So I think that was
really important.

00:50:25.250 --> 00:50:27.650 position:56%
When I came in, of course, there's--

00:50:27.650 --> 00:50:30.540
the programs were really
well-established, some.

00:50:30.540 --> 00:50:35.880
And I have to say, the rise
of nonprofit organizations

00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:38.250
across the country is a phenomenal,

00:50:38.250 --> 00:50:42.280
fabulous nonprofit organizations
that have long history.

00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:48.010
And I think we started discussions
like with the National Council

00:50:48.010 --> 00:50:51.340
for Traditional Arts on
acquiring their collections

00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:56.280
because they have now had 30 years,
40 years in the case of NCTA,

00:50:56.280 --> 00:51:02.980 position:56%
it's like 60 or 70 years of material
that needs to be in the right place.

00:51:02.980 --> 00:51:07.670
And I think that a lot of
state programs and a lot

00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:13.260
of nonprofits are looking at
the AFC as being the home,

00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:17.970
really the preferred home for
materials, ethnographic materials.

00:51:17.970 --> 00:51:19.590
Because we-- that's what we have.

00:51:19.590 --> 00:51:24.270
The resources we have are-- I
mean, look at this institution

00:51:24.270 --> 00:51:30.710
and we have, you know, archivists
and recordists and, you know,

00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:35.970
just an amazing institution
for keeping collections, so.

00:51:35.970 --> 00:51:37.270
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson:
Yeah, I would just add.

00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:39.770 position:56%
I mean, that network is still there,

00:51:39.770 --> 00:51:43.650
it has certainly had
its ups and downs.

00:51:43.650 --> 00:51:46.100
And I don't-- Cliff could
probably say, well--

00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:47.400
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: Yeah.

00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:48.700 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: -- he thinks it's
in an up or a down going right now.

00:51:48.700 --> 00:51:50.000
&gt;&gt; Cliff Murphy: It's
definitely in an up.

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.590
I think we feel all the
time that it's in a down.

00:51:52.590 --> 00:51:55.550 position:56%
And I'm kidding but I'm not kidding.

00:51:55.550 --> 00:51:56.850
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: Yeah.

00:51:56.850 --> 00:51:58.920 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Cliff Murphy: I think that's part
of the mindset of the discipline.

00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:00.220
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: Yeah.

00:52:00.220 --> 00:52:01.520
&gt;&gt; Cliff Murphy: But
I would say that--

00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:02.820
&gt;&gt; Alan Jabbour: Occupational
pessimism.

00:52:02.820 --> 00:52:04.120
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: Yeah.

00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:05.570
&gt;&gt; Cliff Murphy: But I think we
are-- I mean, we are in an up.

00:52:05.570 --> 00:52:06.870
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: Yeah.

00:52:06.870 --> 00:52:08.170
&gt;&gt; Cliff Murphy: Yeah.

00:52:08.170 --> 00:52:09.470
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: We'll
learn also, I think the state

00:52:09.470 --> 00:52:11.640
or more local regional programs,

00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:16.030
where they are now is just
much more diversified.

00:52:16.030 --> 00:52:18.480
They're not only in
state arts agencies.

00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:23.270
In fact, I mean, that probably
is becoming smaller but they're

00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:24.690
in universities, they're

00:52:24.690 --> 00:52:29.590
in nonprofit stand-alones
or humanities agencies.

00:52:29.590 --> 00:52:32.210
I mean, there's just-- it's--

00:52:32.210 --> 00:52:35.520
the tentacles have,
you know, reached out.

00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:39.940
So, it may not be this
one group anymore.

00:52:39.940 --> 00:52:41.240
&gt;&gt; Cliff Murphy: Right.

00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:42.540
I think it gotten a
little more diversified

00:52:42.540 --> 00:52:46.890
that right now there are 38
active state programs and the rest

00:52:46.890 --> 00:52:49.870
of the NEA folk arts staff
can check that figure.

00:52:49.870 --> 00:52:51.370
And if I'm wrong, I'm happy.

00:52:51.370 --> 00:52:55.620
If it's higher-- that's so-- yeah.

00:52:55.620 --> 00:52:57.720
But I can say as a former, say,

00:52:57.720 --> 00:53:02.140 position:56%
folklorist that also the AFC staff
here was helpful in terms of working

00:53:02.140 --> 00:53:05.610
with us to make sure that our
collections were organized

00:53:05.610 --> 00:53:09.100
and that they were safe and that
they were processed properly

00:53:09.100 --> 00:53:12.390
and that they had a home
even if that home didn't wind

00:53:12.390 --> 00:53:16.940
up being the AFC; that they were--
they helped us to be good stewards

00:53:16.940 --> 00:53:19.680
of that material as well, so.

00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:23.230
Other questions?

00:53:23.230 --> 00:53:24.530
Dan.

00:53:24.530 --> 00:53:27.600
&gt;&gt; Alan Jabbour: Dan.

00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:29.190
&gt;&gt; Dan Sheehy: Great to
see you all up there.

00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:33.030
It's a beautiful sight.

00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:37.160 position:56%
Two things, first of all, the Nagra,
I can't resist mentioning this.

00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:40.510
I was a child of the Nagra era
and this was like, oh my god,

00:53:40.510 --> 00:53:44.040
if you have a Nagra just in your
vicinity, it was a beautiful thing.

00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:46.740
I noticed the media director
at the Center for Folklife

00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:50.210
and Cultural Heritage often uses
the Nagra as a doorstop these days.

00:53:50.210 --> 00:53:51.760
They just gave a-- just kind

00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:55.540
of a nice juxtaposition
of, you know, eras.

00:53:56.570 --> 00:53:58.870
Question is, maybe two parts,

00:53:58.870 --> 00:54:02.990
one is that you've had some really
notable successes in collaborations

00:54:02.990 --> 00:54:04.920
and taking things under
your wing over the years,

00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:07.080
the Veterans History Project,

00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:10.020
the StoryCorps stuff that's
really punched through out there

00:54:10.020 --> 00:54:12.770
and reached, I don't know,
how any millions but I--

00:54:12.770 --> 00:54:16.270
so I've also noticed, for me,
anyway, one of the advantages

00:54:16.270 --> 00:54:19.730
of projects like that is that
it tends to be reflective

00:54:19.730 --> 00:54:23.030
of the changing demographics
of our changing nation.

00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:28.260
And so, the sort of the two-part
question there is how you've seen--

00:54:28.260 --> 00:54:31.340
if you've seen kind of a "feedback
loop" as Alan used to say,

00:54:31.340 --> 00:54:34.650
Alan Lomax, of that
success coming back

00:54:34.650 --> 00:54:36.090
and then benefiting the programs

00:54:36.090 --> 00:54:38.820
and the whole thing
being a virtuous cycle.

00:54:38.820 --> 00:54:43.420
And the other is that have you
seen that as yourselves as a--

00:54:43.420 --> 00:54:46.210
an effective strategy
of both capturing

00:54:46.210 --> 00:54:52.410
and engaging a broad diversity
of American public particularly?

00:54:52.410 --> 00:54:53.710

00:54:56.690 --> 00:54:57.990
Yeah.

[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:54:59.290 --> 00:55:00.660
I'll just say real quickly
and then I'll turn it over,

00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:05.450
is that absolutely, I'm glad
you mentioned StoryCorps.

00:55:05.450 --> 00:55:10.010 position:56%
That was one of the battles I fought
tooth-and-nail with Dr. Billington

00:55:10.010 --> 00:55:12.720
about that I thought
it should come here.

00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:15.670
I know probably some people
would disagree with that.

00:55:15.670 --> 00:55:21.250
But the one thing that I have to
say is that every Friday morning,

00:55:21.250 --> 00:55:24.470
the American Folklife Center,
Library of Congress was

00:55:24.470 --> 00:55:26.850
on NPR on Morning Edition.

00:55:26.850 --> 00:55:31.810
And even today, people will ask
me, I'm retired, I'm in Florida,

00:55:31.810 --> 00:55:33.110
they'll say, "Well,
what did you do?"

00:55:33.110 --> 00:55:36.080
I said, "Oh, I was director of
the American Folklife Center."

00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:37.470
"Oh StoryCorps!"

00:55:37.470 --> 00:55:41.090 position:56%
They know-- If nothing else, like
they have that, you know, and they--

00:55:41.090 --> 00:55:46.010
and then they actually have an idea
about kind of what I was about--

00:55:46.010 --> 00:55:47.310
&gt;&gt; Alan Jabbour: Yeah.

00:55:47.310 --> 00:55:48.610
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: -- in
terms of talking to people.

00:55:48.610 --> 00:55:54.250
So, yeah, I think it-- that's
one of the important things.

00:55:54.250 --> 00:55:56.100
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: Well, I
think, I mean, sort of going back

00:55:56.100 --> 00:56:01.250 position:56%
to this kind of federal government
nonprofit sort of thing, for me, I--

00:56:01.250 --> 00:56:04.520
we are also-- we continue
working with StoryCorps

00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:08.060
and StoryCorps continues
to innovate.

00:56:08.060 --> 00:56:13.690
And I think for us going
forward to develop new projects,

00:56:13.690 --> 00:56:18.890
work in new directions, we're going
to have to work with third parties.

00:56:18.890 --> 00:56:24.090
They are those creative
engines that can push into areas

00:56:24.090 --> 00:56:29.490
that may be difficult for us to
do or may take us forever to do.

00:56:29.490 --> 00:56:34.600
And that's probably more--
the accurate description.

00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:37.650
But we will need to
work with those folks.

00:56:37.650 --> 00:56:42.250
It is getting us out into different
directions, different, certainly,

00:56:42.250 --> 00:56:46.810
I mean, oral history is a much
bigger part of what we do.

00:56:46.810 --> 00:56:48.440
I mean, oral history was always--

00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:52.600
and it's sort of entwined with
folklore and ethnomusicology,

00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:56.220
it's just sort of a part
of the mix of things.

00:56:56.220 --> 00:57:00.630
But as in separated or
separate thing unto itself,

00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:04.860
it's becoming more and
more prominent in our work

00:57:04.860 --> 00:57:07.580
and that may be just
sort of the time as well.

00:57:07.580 --> 00:57:11.920
I'm-- I'd be curious to see
if that's happening elsewhere.

00:57:14.050 --> 00:57:17.330
Yeah, it's diversifying our methods

00:57:17.330 --> 00:57:21.920
and the populations
that we're working with.

00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:24.620
I don't know.

00:57:24.620 --> 00:57:27.750
&gt;&gt; Alan Jabbour: That-- I
don't-- I can 't add to that.

00:57:27.750 --> 00:57:32.880

guys did great and thank you

00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:34.860
for fighting for StoryCorps.

difficult collection to manage.

that, you know, when you talked

00:57:50.760 --> 00:57:54.790
about unfinished business and
all but I'm wondering, too,

00:57:54.790 --> 00:57:57.290
if you have thought
about where, you know,

00:57:57.290 --> 00:58:02.410
I know that we're celebrating
40 years.

00:58:02.410 --> 00:58:06.010
In another 40 years, what
should we have accomplished?

00:58:07.080 --> 00:58:09.560
You know, what are the
challenges that face us right now?

00:58:09.560 --> 00:58:12.100
And maybe that's too big of a
question to ask at the very end,

00:58:12.100 --> 00:58:18.520
but, you know, what should we have
accomplished in another 40 years?

00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:21.210

should still be around,

[ Laughter and Applause ]

00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:29.390
That would be the major
thing, is that people would--

00:58:29.390 --> 00:58:31.700
there would still be an
American Folklife Center

00:58:31.700 --> 00:58:36.670
that really has a national
role and that, you know,

00:58:36.670 --> 00:58:39.050
is viable and is doing...

I can't even imagine what 40 years
from now is going to look like

00:58:43.690 --> 00:58:46.990
but whatever it looks
like, you know,

00:58:46.990 --> 00:58:49.070
hopefully we would have been able

00:58:49.070 --> 00:58:53.170
to be nimble enough
to go with the flow.

this came up in passing earlier

00:58:58.690 --> 00:59:05.560
but one of the things I was proud
is before I retired is getting--

00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:08.090
helping to get permanent
authorization--

00:59:08.090 --> 00:59:09.390
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: Yes.

00:59:09.390 --> 00:59:10.690

00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:13.290
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: It's a major.

00:59:13.290 --> 00:59:14.590
&gt;&gt; Alan Jabbour: When it was
first created by the Congress,

00:59:14.590 --> 00:59:19.060
it was created but it had to be
reauthorized every three years

00:59:19.060 --> 00:59:25.500
or so by the Congress, again, as
if it were a temporary program

00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:30.180
and needed reevaluation
and perhaps a bit.

00:59:30.180 --> 00:59:35.510
But, getting to the point with
the Congress where they decided,

00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:39.480
"All right, we don't have to fight
about this anymore," you know.

00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:46.770

did it more than any single person,

Thad Cochran of Mississippi,
Republican Senator from Mississippi.

00:59:52.510 --> 00:59:54.890

into a conversation about whether,

01:00:12.370 --> 01:00:19.020
but a conversation about what and
what you do you can't always know

01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:23.800
in particular terms, but if
you're there institutionally,

01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:28.000
you'll be there when new
things, like Veterans History

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:32.340
or StoryCorps present themselves.

01:00:32.340 --> 01:00:37.870
And the director, you know, will
deal with them as they come along

01:00:37.870 --> 01:00:44.050
or maybe even invent
one for the Center

01:00:44.050 --> 01:00:51.480 position:56%
because inventing directions is good
too but most of the time, you know,

01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:55.400
the world is busily doing things.

01:00:55.400 --> 01:01:00.870
And if you watch the world
carefully, you'll pick up ideas

01:01:00.870 --> 01:01:04.220
for where the future
ought to be, you know.

01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:09.260
And inventing really doesn't have
to do with inventing from scratch

01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:13.570
but from catching cues by
paying attention to what's going

01:01:13.570 --> 01:01:16.170
on in the world about us.

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:28.840
of strategic planning
exercises of, you know,

01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:31.950
envision where you're
going to be, I just--

01:01:31.950 --> 01:01:39.300 position:56%
because I never quite know what to
say, I-- yes, we'll still be around,

01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:44.250
the orphan works legislation will
be passed, and we will be able

01:01:44.250 --> 01:01:49.030
to easily get more material
up online or make it more

01:01:49.030 --> 01:01:51.930
and more accessible to
people, also the means

01:01:51.930 --> 01:01:53.610 position:56%
in which we'll be bringing stuff in,

01:01:53.610 --> 01:01:58.630
we'll probably make it
accessible more immediately.

01:01:58.630 --> 01:02:01.580
That we will continue
figuring out how

01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:08.030 position:56%
to balance face-to-face
interaction with tools of technology

01:02:08.030 --> 01:02:13.880
that will allow us to,
I hope, work at a scale

01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:18.790
that we just haven't been able
to quite manage yet, I think.

01:02:18.790 --> 01:02:25.230
And I don't know, we'll--

01:02:25.230 --> 01:02:27.160
&gt;&gt; Cliff Murphy: We'll check
back in after strategic planning.

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:29.060
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: Yeah, we'll--

01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:36.190
and what I think the tools can
make us work more collaboratively

01:02:36.190 --> 01:02:39.250
with communities than
we've been able to do.

01:02:39.250 --> 01:02:44.630
I mean, the impulse and the ability
to do that is always there, again,

01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:49.930
in small-scale or targeted
ways, but I think, you know,

01:02:49.930 --> 01:02:54.230
there are potential means for us to
really more actively bring people

01:02:54.230 --> 01:02:57.560
into our archive, I mean,
to actively, you know,

01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:02.350
engage and impact the
stuff that's coming in.

01:03:02.350 --> 01:03:08.720
And I would hope to see, yeah,
that happening a lot, all the time.

01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:11.650
&gt;&gt; Cliff Murphy: Do we have
time for couple more questions?

01:03:11.650 --> 01:03:14.200
I don't know how we're doing.

01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:15.500
One more question?

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:16.800
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Maybe one more.

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:18.100
&gt;&gt; Alan Jabbour: One half question.

&gt;&gt; Cliff Murphy: Make it a good one.

01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:20.700
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: All right.

01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:22.000
No pressure.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.600
&gt;&gt; Alan Jabbour: Here it is.

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:27.730
&gt;&gt; Female audience member:
I'll ask a question.

01:03:27.730 --> 01:03:32.160
So, as somebody that started
my dissertation research here,

01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:34.810
obviously the collection
has provided, you know,

01:03:34.810 --> 01:03:40.260
all kinds of not only materials
but also methodological ideas

01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:42.340
for scholars and students
and so forth.

01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:48.610
But I wonder if each of
you could comment on a time

01:03:48.610 --> 01:03:54.690
when the collection meant something
for a culture bearer that came in

01:03:54.690 --> 01:03:56.300
and discovered something
by surprise.

01:03:56.300 --> 01:03:59.220
I know I've heard lots about
repatriation and so forth

01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:02.430
but maybe just, you know, an
afternoon that made your day

01:04:02.430 --> 01:04:06.520
when somebody wandered into
the archive and found something

01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:10.360
that was actually,
by extension, theirs.

01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:12.030
&gt;&gt;Peggy Bulger: George Clinton?

01:04:12.030 --> 01:04:14.960
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: Oh, well,
except he didn't wander

01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:19.830
into the archive actually but--
yes, George Clinton came to visit

01:04:19.830 --> 01:04:24.350
and I got my photo taken with
him so I was extremely thrilled.

01:04:24.350 --> 01:04:31.070
Actually, about two months after
I started, a woman, older woman

01:04:31.070 --> 01:04:35.980
and her grandson, I guess, came
in to the archive to listen to--

01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:42.180
he brought her in from Baltimore to
listen to her StoryCorps interview.

01:04:42.180 --> 01:04:45.110
And Anne [Hood] was there
and there were three or four

01:04:45.110 --> 01:04:47.090
of us but it was her birthday.

01:04:47.090 --> 01:04:51.140
And we all went and we stood around
and sane "Happy Birthday" to her

01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:54.980
and it was just-- she was
beaming, it was just--

01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:56.280
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: Yeah.

01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:57.580
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: --

01:04:57.580 --> 01:04:59.010
it was wonderful, just
a sweet little moment.

01:04:59.010 --> 01:05:00.310
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: Yeah.

01:05:00.310 --> 01:05:01.610
&gt;&gt; Alan Jabbour: That's nice.

01:05:01.610 --> 01:05:02.910
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: Oh, go ahead.

01:05:02.910 --> 01:05:04.210
Go ahead.

01:05:04.210 --> 01:05:06.310
&gt;&gt; Alan Jabbour: I thought of, for
some reason, this popped in my mind

01:05:06.310 --> 01:05:10.050
and Mary Hufford and others
in our office did a project

01:05:10.050 --> 01:05:12.820
in the Pine Barrens of New Jersey.

01:05:12.820 --> 01:05:17.630
And in the process, they have--
this was a multi-person project

01:05:17.630 --> 01:05:22.520
and I can't even tell you
who the fieldworker was,

01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:27.020
but one of the fieldworkers
in that project got engaged

01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:34.630 position:56%
with a small African-American
community that was Jewish, you know,

01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:37.680
and Jewish and African-American.

01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:42.310
And thus, from the general
Americans' point of view,

01:05:42.310 --> 01:05:47.070
kind of an anomalist, who
are these people really?

01:05:47.070 --> 01:05:49.000
Well, they're what they are.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.320
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: Twelfth
tribe of Israel.

01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:53.670
&gt;&gt; Alan Jabbour: But, at some
point thereafter, I was director

01:05:53.670 --> 01:06:00.630
of the Center but I happened to be
in the Reading Room of the archive

01:06:00.630 --> 01:06:06.370
when a man from this
community came in.

01:06:06.370 --> 01:06:11.420
And you could tell from his body
language that he was anxious,

01:06:11.420 --> 01:06:17.640 position:56%
like he knew these people, they come
and recorded and photographed them,

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:22.970
did it really go where it was said
to go to the Library of Congress?

01:06:22.970 --> 01:06:24.270
And what was it?

01:06:24.270 --> 01:06:29.590
You know, somehow seeing it
there was reassuring to him

01:06:29.590 --> 01:06:33.420
that he was filled with anxiety.

01:06:33.420 --> 01:06:36.790
And I said, oh, truthfully,
I didn't know that myself.

01:06:36.790 --> 01:06:41.630
And so, we looked into it and
there they were, the recordings

01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:47.680
and the photographs of this
community and we pulled them out,

01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:50.670
he got to look at them, then
he nodded, "oh there's so

01:06:50.670 --> 01:06:52.690
and so, there's so and so."

01:06:52.690 --> 01:06:56.900
And you could feel the anxiety
turning to relief, you know,

01:06:56.900 --> 01:07:01.820
as he thought this really was
the Library of Congress coming

01:07:01.820 --> 01:07:04.770
to document us, you know.

01:07:04.770 --> 01:07:07.760
And this is really
us and now it's here,

01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:09.960
you know, and it's a good thing.

01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:17.760
And for some reason, because of
the transition from anxiety to joy,

01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:24.220
you know, it made me feel good
and remembered the moment, so.

01:07:24.220 --> 01:07:26.320
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: Well,
there's many moments, you know,

01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:31.680
with members of Congress as well
as with people who would just stop

01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:38.220
into my office and want to
just talk about the material

01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:40.080
that their family had given.

01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:44.390
But I have to say, you
know, I came here in 1999,

01:07:44.390 --> 01:07:50.750
it was a different Capitol Hill, a
year-and-half later, 9/11 happened.

01:07:50.750 --> 01:07:59.940
And when 9/11 happened,
it was tough.

01:07:59.940 --> 01:08:04.270
But I-- And I can't remember now,
maybe the staff will help me,

01:08:04.270 --> 01:08:10.820
we had a meeting and because
they didn't close the office,

01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:14.380
for God's sakes, the
Pentagon is on fire

01:08:14.380 --> 01:08:16.720 position:56%
and we're still showing up for work.

01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:20.910
So we show up for work and I
said, "Well, let's just have a--

01:08:20.910 --> 01:08:25.280
let's go in the staff room
and have a meeting and think

01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:27.460
about how do we respond to this."

01:08:27.460 --> 01:08:29.390
Because at this point,
you couldn't give blood

01:08:29.390 --> 01:08:31.260
because they have too much blood;

01:08:31.260 --> 01:08:34.740
you could give money but,
yeah, what could we do?

01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:38.540
And we came up with the idea
of the 9/11 Collection Project

01:08:38.540 --> 01:08:42.750
and we just asked people, send out,
I think Ann [Hoog] was in charge

01:08:42.750 --> 01:08:47.410
of sending out a blast email to
people around the country saying

01:08:47.410 --> 01:08:51.360
if you have a recorder, go
out and talk to somebody

01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:55.750
in your own community right now
what are they feeling about this.

01:08:55.750 --> 01:08:59.220
And I-- it does-- I did
fieldwork, I took the recorder home

01:08:59.220 --> 01:09:02.700 position:56%
to Takoma Park, Maryland, and talked

01:09:02.700 --> 01:09:05.520
to a neighbor I had
never talked to before.

01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:10.910
She was from India and her mom
was from India, lived with her,

01:09:10.910 --> 01:09:15.170
an elderly Indian woman who always
walked around the neighborhood

01:09:15.170 --> 01:09:22.320 position:56%
in her sari and she was terrified to
go outside because of repercussions.

01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:26.550
And I think that was one of
the things I think that we

01:09:26.550 --> 01:09:31.900
as folklorists are so
privileged to be able

01:09:31.900 --> 01:09:38.610
to help people navigate these
horrible divisions that come

01:09:38.610 --> 01:09:41.750
up where people want to divide us.

01:09:41.750 --> 01:09:45.980
And so, that probably is my moment.

01:09:45.980 --> 01:09:48.510
&gt;&gt; Cliff Murphy: I think
that's a nice moment maybe

01:09:48.510 --> 01:09:51.780
to conclude on this.

01:09:51.780 --> 01:09:53.080
That sounded good.

01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:54.380
Should we give a round
of applause to them?

01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:55.680
[ Applause ]

01:09:55.680 --> 01:10:10.680
&gt;&gt; Alan Jabbour: Thank you all.

01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:11.980
[ Applause ]

01:10:11.980 --> 01:10:13.280
&gt;&gt; Cliff Murphy: Sure.

01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:14.580
Yeah.

01:10:14.580 --> 01:10:15.880
&gt;&gt; Alan Jabbour: Thank you.

01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:17.180
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: Oh.

01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:19.890
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: We will have
to get a photo of the three of us.

01:10:19.890 --> 01:10:27.500
But, at the end of the Board
Meeting that just concluded,

01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:31.740
Pat Atkinson presented this
to us, which is commissioned

01:10:31.740 --> 01:10:36.540
by a leatherworker
artist traditional--

01:10:36.540 --> 01:10:39.290
&gt;&gt; Alan Jabbour: How wonderful.

01:10:39.290 --> 01:10:41.440
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: Isn't
that beautiful?

01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:45.930
&gt;&gt; Alan Jabbour: Yeah,
really beautiful.

01:10:45.930 --> 01:10:47.230
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson:
-- a worker from--

01:10:47.230 --> 01:10:48.530
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: Nevada.

01:10:48.530 --> 01:10:49.830
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: -- Nevada.

01:10:49.830 --> 01:10:51.130
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: Nevada.

01:10:51.130 --> 01:10:52.430
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: And it
will certainly go up into our,

01:10:52.430 --> 01:10:53.730
probably in our conference room
or reading room or somewhere.

01:10:53.730 --> 01:10:55.030
We're very thrilled.

01:10:55.030 --> 01:10:56.330
&gt;&gt; Cliff Murphy: Happy birthday.

01:10:56.330 --> 01:10:57.630
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson:
Yeah, happy birthday.

01:10:57.630 --> 01:10:58.930
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: Yeah.

01:10:58.930 --> 01:11:00.230
[ Applause ]

01:11:00.230 --> 01:11:01.530
