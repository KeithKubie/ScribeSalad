I would like to talk briefly about

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:07.250
I would like to talk briefly about
 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.619
I would like to talk briefly about
depolarization on the left and the right

00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:09.629
depolarization on the left and the right
 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:11.029
depolarization on the left and the right
because I think there's a technical

00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:11.039
because I think there's a technical
 

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:14.650
because I think there's a technical
problem that needs to be addressed so

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:14.660
problem that needs to be addressed so
 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.580
problem that needs to be addressed so
here's what I've been thinking about

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590
here's what I've been thinking about
 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.279
here's what I've been thinking about
it's been obvious to me for some time

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289
it's been obvious to me for some time
 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.029
it's been obvious to me for some time
that for some reason the fundamental

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039
that for some reason the fundamental
 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.579
that for some reason the fundamental
claim of post-modernism is something

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:25.589
claim of post-modernism is something
 

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:26.599
claim of post-modernism is something
like an infinite number of

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609
like an infinite number of
 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.519
like an infinite number of
interpretations and no canonical

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529
interpretations and no canonical
 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.589
interpretations and no canonical
overarching narrative okay but the

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599
overarching narrative okay but the
 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.360
overarching narrative okay but the
problem with that is okay now what no

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370
problem with that is okay now what no
 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.610
problem with that is okay now what no
narrative no value structure that's

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620
narrative no value structure that's
 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.260
narrative no value structure that's
canonical or overarching so what the

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270
canonical or overarching so what the

world well the post modernists have no
answer to that so what happens is they

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680
answer to that so what happens is they
 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.820
answer to that so what happens is they

and like we've seen the consequence of

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040
and like we've seen the consequence of
 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.000

former Soviet Union propaganda pieces
 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.670
former Soviet Union propaganda pieces
but also kind of harsh impressionist

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680
but also kind of harsh impressionist
 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.530
but also kind of harsh impressionist
pieces of working-class people and so

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540
pieces of working-class people and so
 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.300
pieces of working-class people and so
forth and I collected them for a variety

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310
forth and I collected them for a variety
 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.230

of reasons now you could debate about

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240
of reasons now you could debate about
 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.000
of reasons now you could debate about
the propriety of that given the

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010
the propriety of that given the
 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.120
the propriety of that given the

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130
murderous nosov the regimes and fair
 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.430
murderous nosov the regimes and fair
enough I have my reasons but I don't

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440
enough I have my reasons but I don't
 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.580
enough I have my reasons but I don't
have paintings from the Nazi area era in

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590
have paintings from the Nazi area era in
 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.790
have paintings from the Nazi area era in
my house and I wouldn't and that's been

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800
my house and I wouldn't and that's been
 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.700
my house and I wouldn't and that's been
a puzzlement to me because I regard the

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710
a puzzlement to me because I regard the
 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.220
a puzzlement to me because I regard the
Communists the totalitarian communist

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230
Communists the totalitarian communist
 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.160
Communists the totalitarian communist
regimes as just as murderous as the Nazi

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170
regimes as just as murderous as the Nazi
 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.530
regimes as just as murderous as the Nazi
regimes but there's an evil associated

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540
regimes but there's an evil associated
 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.180
regimes but there's an evil associated
with the Nazi regime that seems more

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190
with the Nazi regime that seems more
 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.760
with the Nazi regime that seems more
palpable in some sense so I've been

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770
palpable in some sense so I've been
 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.560
palpable in some sense so I've been
thinking about that for a long time

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570
thinking about that for a long time
 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.050
thinking about that for a long time
and then I've been thinking about a

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060
and then I've been thinking about a
 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.160
and then I've been thinking about a
corollary to that which is part of the

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170
corollary to that which is part of the
 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.540
corollary to that which is part of the
problem with our current political

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550
problem with our current political
 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:31.940
problem with our current political
debate so on the right I think we've

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950
debate so on the right I think we've
 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.580
debate so on the right I think we've
identified markers for people who've

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590
identified markers for people who've
 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.490
identified markers for people who've
gone too far in their ideological

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500
gone too far in their ideological
 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.840
gone too far in their ideological
presuppositions and it looks to me like

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850
presuppositions and it looks to me like
 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.090
presuppositions and it looks to me like
the marker we've identified is racial

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100
the marker we've identified is racial
 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.000
the marker we've identified is racial
superiority and I think we've known that

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010
superiority and I think we've known that
 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.920
superiority and I think we've known that
probably since the end of World War two

that's the intersectional problem right

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:56.160
that's the intersectional problem right
 

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.010
that's the intersectional problem right
though the radical leftists have already

00:07:58.010 --> 00:07:58.020
though the radical leftists have already
 

00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:59.390

hit the problem of intersectionality

00:07:59.390 --> 00:07:59.400
hit the problem of intersectionality
 

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.540

it's like well we've got race and gender

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:01.550
it's like well we've got race and gender
 

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:04.400
it's like well we've got race and gender
let's say well okay what about the

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:04.410
let's say well okay what about the
 

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:05.719
let's say well okay what about the
intersection between race and gender

00:08:05.719 --> 00:08:05.729
intersection between race and gender
 

00:08:05.729 --> 00:08:07.640

that's a multiplicative intersection

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:07.650
that's a multiplicative intersection
 

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:09.710
that's a multiplicative intersection
right so you might start with three

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:09.720
right so you might start with three
 

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.330
right so you might start with three
racial categories and two gender

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:11.340
racial categories and two gender
 

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:13.010
racial categories and two gender
categories but you end up with six

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:13.020
categories but you end up with six
 

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:15.290
categories but you end up with six
intersectional categories and then

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:15.300
intersectional categories and then
 

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:16.790
intersectional categories and then
you're just getting started how many
