00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:34.930
&gt;&gt;Female Introducer: Hi everyone. Welcome.
On behalf of the Authors@Google program, I

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.680
am excited to welcome back Mary Roach. As
one of you put is, Mary is one of the funniest

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.860
and most madcap of science writers. She is
of the firm belief that there is no question

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.220
to goofy to ask, or boring to Google. Her
previous books include: "Stiff: The Curious

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.410
Lives of Human Cadavers," "Spook: Science
Tackles the Afterlife" and "Bonk: The Curious

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.770
Coupling of Science and Sex." Her newest book
is "Packing for Mars: The Curious Science

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:45.770
of Life in the Void."

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.950
Now Mary probably had aspirations of becoming
an astronaut, but Mary has done us the courtesy

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:58.220
of researching all things that our eight-year-old
selves forgot to think of like, how you keep

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:05.059
clean up in space? Showers don't work without
gravity. What do you eat? Mom's Rice Krispy

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.300
treats probably won't meet NASA's nutrition
standards. And most importantly, where do

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:13.370
you go to the bathroom? Toilets don't work
in zero G either. Lucky for us the book goes

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:14.890
into extreme detail.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:15.890
[Laughter]

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:22.520
About these questions and more, here to tell
us more, please welcome Mary Roach.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.520
[Applause]

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:31.060
&gt;&gt;Mary Roach: Thank you. This is my Tang substitute.
[laughter] On my book tour I actually, my

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:39.170
publicist thought it would be a great idea
to have Tang in the bookstores for everybody

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.270
so I would dutifully drink Tang until I realized
my kidneys were starting probably to fluoresce.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.270
[Laughter]

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.689
Tang. I always start by telling people, Tang
is not a NASA invention. Actually I'm gonna

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:52.660
use this guy. Ooh, it's got a cord. This is
very old school--I like this. Can everybody

00:01:52.660 --> 00:02:02.810
hear OK? Is this even turned on? Is it turned
on, right? OK. I feel like Merv Griffin.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:03.810
[Laughter]

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:13.310
No, anyway. But Tang, Tang is not an invention
of NASA. NASA just would order it from the

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.709
store, like anybody else. Is it called a commercial
off-the-shelf product, COTS product, and NASA

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.920
actually does a lot of purchasing of COTS,
commercial off-the-shelf products, including

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.180
the diapers that they wear in the big, puffy
space walking suits when they go to repair

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.100
to the solar panel or whatever, they are wearing
an adult diaper. And I don't know what they

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.190
are using now, but for a period of time, this
is true, the public affairs office told me

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.260
this--it was a brand called Rejoice.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.629
[Laughter]

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:46.420
Just like the most optimistic name for an
adult diaper that you can imagine. Anyway,

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:54.280
so, my book is a book about space and astronauts,
but not really a typical book about space

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.720
and astronauts. I don't know if there necessarily
a typical, but there's a lot of sort of heroics

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.900
and bravely going and coming back. And you
have Jim Lovell and Apollo 13 fighting, his

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.640
crew and him fighting for their lives and
the way of the moon, explosion, all of that.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:15.180
It's not that kind of book. I did talk to
Captain Lovell, but not about Apollo 13, I

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:21.069
talked to him about Gemini 7. Gemini 7 was
fascinating to me because it was the longest

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:26.660
mission to date. It was a two-week mission.
It was the first time people had been in space

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.489
for that long. Before that it had been a few
days and part of what they were trying to

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:36.010
figure out, at that point, was, is two weeks
in a spacesuit, in a cramped space, without

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.319
a bathroom, without a shower, it is just too
horrible for a human being? It is too much

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:47.100
to stand? It is too awful? Do you get too
disgusting? So, that's actually what they

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:54.580
were looking into, and I did, you know, you
can look through the transcript, the mission

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.769
transcript, for all of the missions that NASA's
done. There are those big huge PDF files that

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:06.330
you can read, and there's a moment at Gemini,
Gemini 7, where the flight surgeon comes on

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.200
the radio, because there is a lot of information
back and forth, it's a medical mission essentially.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.830
And the flight surgeon comes on the line and
he is talking to Commander Borman, who is

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:20.629
the other, there are two of them in the capsule.
He is like, exact words were, "Gemini 7, this

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:27.309
is the flight surgeon. Have you had any dandruff
problems up there, Frank?" I mean, this to

00:04:27.309 --> 00:04:33.129
me is, the word "dandruff" in a mission transcript,
in an official NASA mission transcript, I

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:37.469
don't know why this just delighted me. And
further on the word "lotion." There are like

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:43.119
two grown men, orbiting earth, discussing
skin care. Commander Borman, Frank Borman,

00:04:43.119 --> 00:04:48.930
was sort of difficult guy, and after a while
he stopped answering all questions about personal

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:54.420
products and skin care. It was like compromising
the overall manliness of the mission.

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:55.490
[Laughter]

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:02.469
But you kind of, you did have to feel bad
for them because this is zero gravity and

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:06.349
if you do have dandruff, it's not going to
fall to your shoulders, it's not going to

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:11.710
fall to the floor. It kind of hovers and I
actually asked Jim Lovell. I got Jim Lovell

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:16.699
to call me back, I think because everyone
wants to talk about Apollo 13 and nobody never

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:21.779
asks him about Gemini 7. So, you know, we
got on the phone and I said, "So was it just

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:25.129
likes a snow globe in there?"

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:26.129
[Laughter]

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:35.789
He said, "Mary you are investigating a rather
and usual aspect, a space flight."

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:36.789
[Laughter]

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:42.960
Anyway, so, I wanted, you know, the book is
about astronauts, it's about life in space,

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:49.419
but it's also about space on earth because
I found out that, because space is this really,

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:55.249
extreme, hostile, unusual, expensive place
where nothing that works down here works the

00:05:55.249 --> 00:05:59.410
same as it does up there. And you need to
test it, and you need to kind of test it in

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:03.949
zero gravity if possible, and that is a little
tricky to do. You have to essentially put

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:10.969
it on one of these planes that kind of flies
like this. So anyway, but they do, they test

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:18.969
everything. They test even the toilets. OK,
now toilets, some people take gravity a little

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:25.039
bit for granted, I think. You kind of think
about water system. You know, there's the

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:29.249
sewage and the water and you don't realize
gravity plays a big role here because what

00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:37.289
you have is, you have a growing mass, OK,
that's being extruded and with more mass you

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:42.610
have greater gravitation, and at a certain
point the material breaks free and falls down

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:47.300
into the toilet where it's whisked away and
everybody is happy. Well, in zero gravity

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:59.199
this doesn't happen, it just kind of hovers.
And, so, the zero gravity toilet has to give

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:03.949
you what they call, NASA Waste Management
people call "Good Separation." This is the

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:09.990
Holy Grail of the waste management engineer
at NASA. Good separation. So the toilet now

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:14.649
has to provide that separation and the way
it does it is by air flow. It sort of entrains

00:07:14.649 --> 00:07:21.319
the bolas. I've got a lot of euphemisms out
of that. My time with the NASA Waste Management

00:07:21.319 --> 00:07:24.539
Department. So you didn't train the bolas?
Well you have airflow doing that. It's basically

00:07:24.539 --> 00:07:31.029
like sitting on a Shop-Vac. I was gonna say
shitting on a Sop Vac. [Laughter] Like sitting

00:07:31.029 --> 00:07:37.710
on a Shop Vac, or shitting in a Sop Vac. Really,
either. OK, how much air flow, though? You

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:41.300
need to know, because if you have got too
much air flow you, all suction, you could

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:49.020
have some serious, uncomfortable-ness. Basically,
you got to test it, so you have to hold the

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:53.779
entire toilet over to Ellington Field and
get it on one of those planes, that does the,

00:07:53.779 --> 00:08:01.909
C9, like this, and as the plane goes over
and down into a dive you have about 22 seconds

00:08:01.909 --> 00:08:05.129
of zero gravity. OK, now, think about that.

00:08:05.129 --> 00:08:06.129
[Laughter]

00:08:06.129 --> 00:08:13.219
You are testing your toilet. This means, some
poor schmo from the Waste Management Systems

00:08:13.219 --> 00:08:20.249
Department has 22 seconds in which to perform.
And I was never on, sadly, on one of these

00:08:20.249 --> 00:08:24.849
flights, but I did talked to someone who had
been on boarded, it was Charles Borland, and

00:08:24.849 --> 00:08:30.029
he is the guy who designed a lot of the food
systems that they use during Apollo and even

00:08:30.029 --> 00:08:34.959
through Shuttle. And Charles Borland was there,
he had like 22 different food system packaging,

00:08:34.959 --> 00:08:39.779
various things he was testing to make sure
it would work, and he said: "You know, they

00:08:39.779 --> 00:08:44.980
had the toilet people, they had a curtain
that they pulled, but you could see, you know,

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:48.990
underneath the curtains and as we got into
the dive you'd see everything start to hover

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:54.069
and you'd hear like, 'Go, go, go, go, go!'"

00:08:54.069 --> 00:08:55.069
[Laughter]

00:08:55.069 --> 00:08:58.190
And the guy failed. I mean—

00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:59.300
[Laughter]

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:05.380
I mean, who wouldn't? If it were me, I mean,
my colon would be like, you know, sorry boss,

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:13.170
10am absolute latest I can do for you. So,
this is why at NASA Ames, there is an engineer

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:20.339
and part of his job was to design a very high
fidelity fecal simulant. So now, no poor guy

00:09:20.339 --> 00:09:25.629
from Waste Management Systems has to go ride
the Vomit Comet, on the toilet, and try to

00:09:25.629 --> 00:09:32.610
go in 22 seconds. So this is a very long-winded,
rambling way of saying that everything gets

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:41.839
simulated in the most entertaining ways. Let's
see, they also do--the psychological elements

00:09:41.839 --> 00:09:47.000
of long duration space flight are a little
easier and cheaper to simulate. Basically

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.500
you put people in a box for a while and you
watch them and you see, give them difficult

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:56.740
stressful situations and you put in people
of different gender and culture and you see

00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:02.430
how they don't get along and fist fights break
out and people claim sexual harassment so,

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:08.350
there are all kinds of these interesting psychological
simulations. It's a little difficult, as I

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:14.260
as a reporter, I like to go on scene and be
there, so I thought, well I'll apply. There

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:19.060
was one called Mars500, you might have heard
of, that is underway right now. And there

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:23.130
was a little three-month trial for Mars500
and there is something going on in Moscow.

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:29.060
A bunch of boxes underground floor of the
Institute for Biomedical Problems, which if

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:31.750
it were here it would be Institute of Biomedical
Solutions.

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:33.340
[Laughter]

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:40.529
But in Moscow, it's Problems. So, the Russian
Space Agency and the European Space Agency

00:10:40.529 --> 00:10:46.350
we're gonna do this stimulation, Simulated
Mars Mission, and to work out the kinks, they

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:50.279
thought, OK, we'll do a three-month lead-up
just to see how everything goes and I thought,

00:10:50.279 --> 00:10:55.529
well, that would be very interesting for the
book, so I applied and I got, as far as I

00:10:55.529 --> 00:11:00.399
got. I passed the medical portion of it and
various sort of filling out the form, or whatever,

00:11:00.399 --> 00:11:04.460
and they said, OK, you made it onto the next
stage, and I said, OK, great. They said, we'll

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:10.829
be calling you. So, some weeks went by and
the phone rings and it's 4 in the morning

00:11:10.829 --> 00:11:16.810
and I don't really take care to hide my irritation,
that it's 4 in the morning and I picked it

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:20.879
up and "Hello," and "This is the European
Space Agency and we understand you've applied."

00:11:20.879 --> 00:11:26.389
and "Don't you know what coast? I don't live
in Europe," you know, I was just the bitch

00:11:26.389 --> 00:11:31.121
that I am, especially at 4 in the morning.
Well, that was part of the test. So I did

00:11:31.121 --> 00:11:32.121
not get chosen--

00:11:32.121 --> 00:11:33.121
[Laughter]

00:11:33.121 --> 00:11:42.149
--to be part of the Mars500 lead-up. But anyway,
it's an interesting situation, the psychological--I

00:11:42.149 --> 00:11:48.310
got called a bunch, when the Chilean miners
were underground. This is sort of an analogist

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:52.800
situation, they call it "isolation and confinement,"
and it does a very unique number on the human

00:11:52.800 --> 00:12:00.600
psyche. You a, space is a really, it's a frustrating
place, because you're stuck in this room and

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:05.190
you can't, you really soaking in it. If something
is bothering you, you can't just run out,

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:09.019
slam the door and go for a drive. All the
things that you may do to relive stress, like

00:12:09.019 --> 00:12:17.879
going for a jog, or having a drink, or a hot
bath, or shopping, whatever it is that you

00:12:17.879 --> 00:12:22.070
do to relive stress you can't do that in space,
so you get this frustration that builds up

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:29.700
and up, and in a long mission it starts to
kind of metastasize to just anger and hostility

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:34.810
and psychologists will tell you, anger wants
an outlet, so if somebody is gonna get it.

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:40.040
You are gonna reach the breaking point and
get mad at someone. And in space you don't

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:45.129
want to get mad at your fellows crew members
because you depend on them for your survival,

00:12:45.129 --> 00:12:49.769
you are only gonna make them mad or worse.
So what happens, and it's called "Displacement,"

00:12:49.769 --> 00:12:54.199
and what happens, and you see it in the mission
transcripts, the astronauts would get really

00:12:54.199 --> 00:12:58.439
irritable with Mission Control. And those
poor guys at Mission Control—people are

00:12:58.439 --> 00:13:03.029
just like: "I can't do that because it's on
the other side of the capsule. You don't even

00:13:03.029 --> 00:13:09.210
not where it is." It's really, you see, in
Gemini 7 there is this moment Captain Lovell,

00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:16.110
again, for him it wasn't Mission Control,
it was the nutritionist, Dr. Chance. You're

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:20.870
reading along on the transcript and you'll
see lot of going; "A memo to Dr. Chance: chicken

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:27.319
a la king, serial number 645, cannot even
get material through neck of packaging!" And

00:13:27.319 --> 00:13:32.860
then like a minute later, "Further memo to
Dr. Chance: Chicken a la king all over the

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:33.860
window at this time.--

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:35.610
[Laughter]

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:42.649
--At $300 a meal, I think you guys can do
better!" Just really. Just letting them have

00:13:42.649 --> 00:13:48.720
it. Hopefully Dr. Chance was getting some
counseling, like don]t take it personally,

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:56.939
he's just feeling frustrated. So, yes, poor
Dr. Chance. Anyway, so, simulations. What

00:13:56.939 --> 00:14:01.490
else was I going to tell you guys about?

00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:13.490
I can do this with one hand [unscrewing bottle
cap]. The third thing you can do with your

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:19.529
anger. You don't take it out on Dr. Chance
or Mission Control people, you turn it inward,

00:14:19.529 --> 00:14:23.709
then you get depression. That's the classic
way to create depression in an individual

00:14:23.709 --> 00:14:31.820
is to have no real outlet for anger and frustration
and turn it inward, and this, you would see

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:36.880
in some of the Mir missions and longer IS
(International Space) Station missions. There

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:41.160
was some serious depression going on at some
of the astronauts and cosmonauts have been

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:45.829
more candid about in recent years. I've interviewed
a couple of cosmonauts who had spent six month

00:14:45.829 --> 00:14:52.649
together on Mir. Yuri Romanenko and Aleksandr
Laveykin and I asked Laveykin about this.

00:14:52.649 --> 00:14:56.990
I said. "Did you find it a very depressing
experience?" and he said, "Mary, there were

00:14:56.990 --> 00:15:01.199
times when I wanted to hang myself but it's
weightlessness--"

00:15:01.199 --> 00:15:02.209
[Laughter]

00:15:02.209 --> 00:15:10.550
--but you can't." The cosmonauts are really.
Sometimes it was a little difficult to get

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:16.800
the kind of access I wanted or the kind of
candor that I wanted at NASA so I went all

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:23.170
the way to Star City, outside Moscow. And
these guys were great, I was gonna say, they

00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:30.050
are so down to earth. That's not the best
term for an astronaut, cosmonaut, but we just

00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:34.119
had really interesting conversations. You
could ask all the things that NASA, NASA they

00:15:34.119 --> 00:15:37.620
were trying to be helpful in their way but
they just don't really like when people bring

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:47.879
up things like sex. But in Moscow, I remember
I said, you know, "You guys, six month, a

00:15:47.879 --> 00:15:52.920
couple of guys in a can. You're young, healthy
men, was that kind of awkward? What do you

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:58.259
do with your sexual urges?" He said, "Mary,
everybody asks me this," and I said, "Sasha,"

00:15:58.259 --> 00:16:02.639
that was his nickname, "Sasha, how are you
making sex in space?" and he says, "Of course,

00:16:02.639 --> 00:16:09.170
by hand." [Laughter] And he said, "Why is
this an issue? Who cares?" So, anyway he was

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:16.860
a lovely and delightful person. I think I'll
read one little passage because it's kind

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:19.639
of fun and then maybe I'll open it up for
questions, because I don't know how much time

00:16:19.639 --> 00:16:20.639
we have?

00:16:20.639 --> 00:16:23.579
&gt;&gt;Unknown speaker: Plenty of time.

00:16:23.579 --> 00:16:31.990
&gt;&gt;Mary Roach: OK. I'm going to read a short
section from the book, because it's kind of

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:32.990
a fun section.

00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:42.730
So, this is Apollo 16 and we have Charlie
Duke and John Young who have been tooling

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:48.490
around on the moon, surface of the moon, collecting
rocks, doing their thing up there. And now

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:55.019
they are in a radio debriefing with Mission
Control. "Out of the blue," Young declares,

00:16:55.019 --> 00:16:58.809
"I got the farts again. I got them again,
Charlie. I don't know what the hell gives

00:16:58.809 --> 00:17:03.550
it to me. I think is acid in the stomach.
Following Apollo 15, in which low potassium

00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:08.669
levels were blamed for heart arrhythmias of
the crew, NASA had put potassium-laced, orange,

00:17:08.669 --> 00:17:13.029
grapefruit and other citrus drinks on the
menu.

00:17:13.029 --> 00:17:17.089
"Tang. Young kept going, it's all there on
the mission transcript. I mean, I haven't

00:17:17.089 --> 00:17:21.260
eatten this much citrus fruit in 20 years
and I'll tell you one thing, in another 12

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:25.289
fucking days I'm never eating anymore and
if they offer to serve me potassium with my

00:17:25.289 --> 00:17:31.340
breakfast, I'm gonna throw up. I like an occasional
orange. I really do, but I'll be damned if

00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:37.070
I'm gonna be buried in oranges." Moments later,
Mission Control comes on the line and provides

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:42.710
Young with yet more fodder for indigestion:
'Uh, Ryan, this is Houston.' 'Yes, sir.' 'OK.

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:43.980
You have a hot mike.'

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:47.380
[Laughter]

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:52.270
"'Oh. How long have we had that?'

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:53.270
[Laughter]

00:17:53.270 --> 00:18:03.179
"'That's been on through the de-briefing.'
The day after Young's comments hit the press,

00:18:03.179 --> 00:18:06.120
the Governor of Florida issued a statement.

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:07.190
[Laughter]

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:16.309
"In defense of his state's key crop, Charlie
Duke paraphrases in his memoir. 'It is not

00:18:16.309 --> 00:18:20.640
our orange juice which is causing the trouble;
it is an artificial substitute that does not

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:21.680
come from Florida.'

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:23.870
[Laughter]

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:29.299
"'Murphy,' oh, whoops, 'in fact it was the
potassium not the orange juice, the 'coefficient

00:18:29.299 --> 00:18:34.220
of flatulence for orange juice,' to use the
terminology of USDA Flatus researcher, Edward

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:35.220
Murphy.

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:36.260
[Laughter]

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:44.020
"A panelist on the 1964 conference on Nutrition
in Space and related waste problems is low.

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:49.500
Murphy had reported on research he had done
using an experimental bean meal fed to volunteers,

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:56.039
who had been rigged by a rectal catheter,
to outgas into a measurement device. Murphy

00:18:56.039 --> 00:19:00.990
was interested in individual differences,
not just in the overall volume of flatus,

00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:07.539
but in the different percentages of constituent
gasses. Owing to differences in intestinal

00:19:07.539 --> 00:19:15.210
bacteria, half the population produces no
methane. This makes them attractive as astronauts.

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:16.210
[Laughter]

00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:23.620
"Not because it stinks, but because methane
is highly flammable. Murphy had a unique suggestion

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:30.100
for the NASA astronauts selection committee.
'This wasn't a joke, this paper; The astronaut

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:34.559
maybe selected from that part of population
producing little or no methane or hydrogen--

00:19:34.559 --> 00:19:39.799
hydrogen also being explosive--and very low
levels of hydrogen sulfide and other malodorous

00:19:39.799 --> 00:19:44.190
trace flatus constituents not yet identified.'
In other words, he was telling NASA: when

00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:50.690
you choose your astronauts, make sure you
check their farts. And they did not. This

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:56.620
was never was part of the recommended astronaut
attributes that NASA adopted. But what they

00:19:56.620 --> 00:20:02.940
did instead, is they became very careful in
certain foods were blacklisted. Cabbage, beans,

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:10.830
brussels sprouts and broccoli were actually
blacklisted. You could not serve them in space.

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:14.809
Beans came back during the shuttle era and
there were those who welcomed their arrival,

00:20:14.809 --> 00:20:21.029
not just because they're tasty. The zero gravity
fart has been a popular orbital pursuit, particularly

00:20:21.029 --> 00:20:22.250
on all male flights.

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:25.130
[Laughter]

00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:30.250
"One here tells astronauts using intestinal
gas like rocket propellant to 'launch themselves

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:31.250
across the mid-deck.'

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:34.350
[Laughter]

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:41.110
"As astronaut Roger Crouch put it. Crouch
had heard the claims and was dubious. 'The

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:46.159
mass and velocity of the expelled gas,' he
told me in an email that forever after endeared

00:20:46.159 --> 00:20:51.440
him to me, 'is very small compared to the
mass of the human body, therefore it is unlikely

00:20:51.440 --> 00:21:01.000
that they could accelerate a 180-pound astronaut.'
Crouch pointed out that an exhaled breath

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.980
does not propel an astronaut in any direction
and the lungs hold 6 liters of air versus

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:10.400
the farts, which we have learned from Dr.
Murphy, hold at most, 3 soda cans worth. Or

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:18.409
the average person's, anyway. 'My genes,'
this is Crouch again, 'have blessed me with

00:21:18.409 --> 00:21:25.240
an extraordinary ability to expel the byproducts
of digestion. So, given that, I thought that

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:31.830
it should be tested.'" I love this guy. He's
a retired astronaut, I should point out. There

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:35.559
is just no way as an active astronaut you
would ever have this conversation with somebody

00:21:35.559 --> 00:21:40.299
active. OK, so "I thought it should be tested
and what I thought was a voluminous and rapidly

00:21:40.299 --> 00:21:45.250
expel purge, I fail to move noticeably." So,
there you go.

00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:46.250
[Laughter]

00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:52.779
Yeah, we'll leave it at that. Anyway, I would
love to answer questions that you may have

00:21:52.779 --> 00:21:57.630
about any of this stuff or any of my other
books, or my personal life or really just

00:21:57.630 --> 00:22:07.220
anything at all, because we have little time.
Do we have a little time? If it brings up

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:11.250
something of interest I'll natter on in another
direction, but if anybody has anything that

00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:13.360
love to ask about.

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:16.660
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #1: Maybe we could
just repeat the question.

00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:19.559
&gt;&gt;Mary Roach: Yes. Sure, sure. Yes.

00:22:19.559 --> 00:22:34.160
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #1: I remember reading
your column when [inaudible]. I wonder how

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.220
did that [inaudible]

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:37.450
&gt;&gt; Mary Roach: Sure. Wow, yeah, I wrote a
column for "Reader's Digest" years ago. It

00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:43.809
was a little humor column, it had mostly to
do with my husband. He's a kind of an interesting

00:22:43.809 --> 00:22:50.789
and entertaining individual. "Shush, the refrigerator"--what
was that one about, the refrigerator is listening?

00:22:50.789 --> 00:23:01.769
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #1: It was about
[inaudible]

00:23:01.769 --> 00:23:11.850
&gt;&gt;Mary Roach: Oh my God. I don't even remember.
I wrote a lot of those columns. I'm sure it

00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:18.560
was really funny. Yes. Anyway, how did I get
from that, this was sort of a strange career

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:25.679
trajectory. I went from writing a funny column
for "Reader's Digest" to a book about cadavers.

00:23:25.679 --> 00:23:29.840
And people would occasionally==fans of the
cadaver book would discover the Reader's Digest

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:38.970
column and vice versa, and go, "really?" But
I just--I had been wanting to work on a larger

00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:46.659
project. The column was 700 words. I've been
wanting to come up with a book project. I've

00:23:46.659 --> 00:23:50.429
been writing a column around that time also
for salon.com and there were been a couple

00:23:50.429 --> 00:23:56.660
columns that had to do with some sort of interesting,
bizarre cadaver research. There were three

00:23:56.660 --> 00:24:03.580
columns and a conversation with an agent grew
into a book proposal, wasn't lifelong fascination.

00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:10.330
I never, I was not suckled by morticians,
meaning I had never read about cadavers before.

00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:16.409
It just seemed that everything had been written
about before except cadavers, squirrels. It

00:24:16.409 --> 00:24:21.610
was not much left out there. So, I said, Cadavers.
I'll do that one. So, that's how it happened.

00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:29.159
There was no real logical flow from "Reader's
Digest" to dead bodies. Or not one that I've

00:24:29.159 --> 00:24:31.440
been able to find. Yes.

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:36.500
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #2.I'm really curious
about your thought process. As your writing

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:41.559
this sort of interesting combination of history,
personal interviews, science and humor. How

00:24:41.559 --> 00:24:49.280
do you conceptually work your humor into this?
Is it humor first, science second, or ...?

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:55.639
Mary Roach: That's a great question. The question
is how do you work the humor into the science,

00:24:55.639 --> 00:25:00.100
in the other material, in the other facets
of the book. Do you first start with the humor,

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:07.380
or do you like, inserted, injected afterwards?
I'm definitely, when I am choosing a topic,

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:13.760
I'm trying to find something that will provide
opportunities for fun, humor and surrealness

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:20.740
and quirkiness, so choosing the right topic
is really important. And I try as I go along

00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:25.450
to work in the humor but frequently I feel
it's not funny enough, so I take another pass

00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:29.549
and I'll look for opportunities to kind to
get a little goofier here and there. It's

00:25:29.549 --> 00:25:34.080
a combination of up-front and shoehorning
some more of it in. Yes.

00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:40.460
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #3: So I love the footnotes
in your books

00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:41.460
[Laughter]

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:45.790
&gt;&gt;Mary Roach: The footnotes. Yes. My favorite
part too.

00:25:45.790 --> 00:25:51.110
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #3: [inaudible]...
the comment about anti-gravity [inaudible]

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:56.272
I was wondering how much research you leave
on the cutting room floor?

00:25:56.272 --> 00:25:59.360
&gt;&gt;Mary Roach: The question has to do with
my footnotes. The footnotes are places where

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:05.139
I found something really spectacular, goofy
and fabulous and doesn't really naturally

00:26:05.139 --> 00:26:11.870
fit the narrative and I can't bear to leave
it out, so I put it in a footnote. That's

00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:17.350
why there is very little on my cutting room
floor. The anti-gravity stones? Technically

00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:21.100
should be on the cutting room floor. They
have nothing to do with anything but I couldn't

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:26.570
resist the whole story of Roger Babson, the
man who wanted to defeat gravity and started

00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:29.920
the Gravity Society who were very unfriendly
to me on the phone.

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:30.920
[Laughter]

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:34.769
&gt;&gt;Mary Roach: "We are neither pro, nor anti-gravity."

00:26:34.769 --> 00:26:35.769
[Laughter]

00:26:35.769 --> 00:26:41.600
&gt;&gt; Mary Roach: OK. Good. But then I found
out, yeah, that he had donated money for these

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:46.179
stones, the anti-gravity stones, and Colby
College and a number of these colleges have

00:26:46.179 --> 00:26:51.679
these stones up, because they gave a lot of
money. And the student body came to knocking

00:26:51.679 --> 00:27:01.350
them over. It's like, ha, ha, gravity. Still
exists. And I that I think I worked some of

00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:05.130
into the narrative. It's not all in the footnote.
It should be all in the footnote or on the

00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:13.529
cutting room floor. Or I need to write a biography
of Roger Babson someday. Anyway, not much

00:27:13.529 --> 00:27:17.880
on the cutting room, it's good it goes in
somehow or another. Yes.

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:33.600
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #2: Do you work on...
I noticed [inaudible] and I remember the scene

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:37.309
where cadavers are being pummeled while [inaudible]—

00:27:37.309 --> 00:27:40.179
&gt;&gt;Mary Roach: Oh, the crash impact.

00:27:40.179 --> 00:27:45.039
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #2: [inaudible] You
did a similar one impacting cars.

00:27:45.039 --> 00:27:46.039
&gt;&gt;Mary Roach: Yes.

00:27:46.039 --> 00:27:47.080
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #2: Do you [inaudible]
simultaneously? Do you go back to that place

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:48.080
[inaudible]

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:53.880
&gt;&gt;Mary Roach: Just let me know if you've got
a space cadaver. No, NASA's work with the

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:58.259
cadaver, which is in the new book, was going
on while I was working on that. It was just

00:27:58.259 --> 00:28:02.809
sort of a fluke and I stumbled onto it and
I thought, "Got to have that in the book,"

00:28:02.809 --> 00:28:07.250
because I always get mail from readers of
"Stiff" saying, "When are you gonna do another

00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:13.490
book about cadavers?" or "Or the next one
is not about cadavers!" So, I thought, yes!

00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:19.720
I can work cadavers into the space book, so
I worked my tail off to get access to that.

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:25.610
I mean, I heard about it. I forget where.
I said to NASA, "I wrote the book 'Stiff,'"

00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:31.110
you know, cadavers are me. "I'd like to be
there." They were very uncomfortable with

00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:37.389
this and kept saying, "No, the Constellation
Program says no, the headquarter people says

00:28:37.389 --> 00:28:41.720
no." Finally the guy at Ohio State, where
they run the Crash Test Facility said: "Just

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:46.980
show up, just show up Mary and we'll deal
with it then." So it was a quite dramatic

00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:52.039
morning with the NASA people running down
and telling the graduated students, "Don't

00:28:52.039 --> 00:28:56.750
talk to her." It all worked out OK in the
end, but it was a little touch and go for

00:28:56.750 --> 00:29:04.210
a while. But it was just a fluke, a cadaver
fluke. Interesting image. Yes.

00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:13.010
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #4: [inaudible]

00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:30.870
&gt;&gt;Mary Roach: It would be very similar on
a Mars Mission. The question was in Apollo

00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:36.130
and Gemini you got these two guys in a capsule
and not just the thousands of people at NASA

00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:41.870
and Mission Control, et cetera, but everybody
on the planet watching. There are moments

00:29:41.870 --> 00:29:46.220
of paranoia. I found, and I don't remember
which mission this was, I think it was Gemini

00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:52.860
or Apollo. I wish I could remember which one,
but the astronauts start to hear this weird

00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:59.410
signing sound. One of them goes: "Do you hear
that? It sounds like someone singing." And

00:29:59.410 --> 00:30:02.510
the other guy goes, "Yes, that's really eerie."
And it goes on for a little while and one

00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:06.600
of them said, "Should we tell them about it?"
"No. I don't think so."

00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:11.580
[Laughter]

00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:21.549
I don't know how they dealt with that but
I think that Mars Mission is like the animal

00:30:21.549 --> 00:30:28.309
in the box that everybody is watching. I couldn't
do it. Yes.

00:30:28.309 --> 00:30:32.440
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #5: How is that situation
different from other confined places like

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:33.440
submarines and cave exploring?

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:36.960
&gt;&gt;Mary Roach: Yes. It's not that different.
In fact, they use submarines. They use Antarctic

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:42.240
field camps. They use these as analogs to
do research into isolation and confinement,

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:49.880
because Antarctica, while you are not confined
in a closed space, you are effectively confined

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:55.490
because you can't wander, go anywhere because
you will freeze and die in a whiteout. So,

00:30:55.490 --> 00:30:58.960
you are stuck with the people that you are
with. And it's very, very similar. I don't

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:05.179
know psychologically, I don't know if there
is a unique--They talked about with Mars.

00:31:05.179 --> 00:31:11.570
Sorry, the question was how similar is thse
analog situations to space. They talked about

00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:15.490
one thing that would be different with the
Mars Mission, something called Earth Out of

00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:19.740
View phenomenon. And it would be the first
time that astronauts, any human being, have

00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:25.870
been so far from Earth that can no longer
really see it. And I asked Krikalev, Sergei,

00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:29.549
I think is his first name, who is the head
of the astronaut training in Star City in

00:31:29.549 --> 00:31:35.980
Moscow. I read him a description of how they
think once you can no longer see Earth, like

00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:39.250
the moral structure of Earth will fall away
and people may kill each other and blah, blah,

00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:43.750
blah. And I said, "What do you think about
this?" and he said, "I think that psychologists

00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:45.480
need to write papers."

00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:46.480
[Laughter]

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:50.440
&gt;&gt;Mary Roach: So, that's the main difference
that I hear kind of bandied about. But they

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:51.740
are very, very similar psychologically. Yes.

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:53.179
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #6: Astronauts have
very competitive personalities. Did you see

00:31:53.179 --> 00:31:56.169
different reactions because of that which
wasn't expected otherwise?

00:31:56.169 --> 00:31:58.210
&gt;&gt;Mary Roach: Reactions to?

00:31:58.210 --> 00:32:03.049
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #6: All the toll in
space.

00:32:03.049 --> 00:32:09.320
&gt;&gt;Mary Roach: The question is, "Astronauts
have very competitive personalities and did

00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:19.510
I see manifestations of that?" What's interesting
in aside, is they are competitive but the

00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:24.789
personality of astronauts has change kind
of a 180 degrees from the Mercury and Gemini

00:32:24.789 --> 00:32:32.429
and Apollo era, where you had a kind of aggressive,
macho, bravado, fearlessly going, large ego.

00:32:32.429 --> 00:32:38.419
That's now the wrong stuff because you've
got much longer missions with five or six

00:32:38.419 --> 00:32:44.340
people, so you kind of want a sensitive, new
age guy. You want someone with empathy. The

00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:49.919
actual, some of the recommended astronaut
attributes are ability to form stable and

00:32:49.919 --> 00:32:58.410
quality interpersonal relationships, sense
of humor, fairness, empathy, ability to tolerate

00:32:58.410 --> 00:33:05.799
long stretches of tedium. So, they are still
aggressive, I mean, they still are competitive

00:33:05.799 --> 00:33:09.389
because it is a very competitive, there is
not that many jobs open. So, they tend to

00:33:09.389 --> 00:33:13.919
be, yes, competitive, but not kind of the
confrontational big ego types. They're really

00:33:13.919 --> 00:33:23.590
easy going. Peggy Whitson, the commander on
ISS, when I was researching the book, she'd

00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:29.240
be on NASA TV a lot and the example that I
tell people, to me sums up how you need to

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:34.120
be to be an astronaut. The guy from Mission
Control comes on and says, "Commander Whitson,

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:39.049
you took, you know the photos that you took
this morning? We can't find those anywhere."

00:33:39.049 --> 00:33:44.230
If it was me, I would be like, so look again,
because I spent a long time on that and I

00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:48.110
have a lot to do up here, I'm a little stress,
I didn't get any sleep, so–But she just

00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:53.399
goes, "That's not a problem. We can do those
again." That's what they're like now. They're

00:33:53.399 --> 00:33:54.399
not like Tom Wolfe's astronauts. Yes.

00:33:54.399 --> 00:33:59.010
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #3: Can you talk
a little about [inaudible]

00:33:59.010 --> 00:34:09.840
&gt;&gt;Mary Roach: Oh, I do know, I do know what's
next, but I don't have a file of fabulous

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:14.220
ideas waiting to be written. And I wish that
I did, because every time I work on a book

00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:20.000
I think: "God, this is it; I never will come
up with another idea." It's kind of a process

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:31.080
of elimination. That says something else to
me now, since that chapter in the book. But

00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:36.720
there are only so many topics that work, that
are gonna have some history, some science,

00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:44.120
some fun, some color. I kind of know it when
I see it. Here is an example: "Bonk," the

00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:49.940
sex lab book. There was absolutely a moment,
an exact moment where I knew, this is the

00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:55.370
next book. I read a reference to, Masters
and Johnson had done--they were trying, Masters

00:34:55.370 --> 00:35:00.450
and Johnson late '50s, were trying to document
the entire human sexual response cycle, and

00:35:00.450 --> 00:35:06.120
for women some of that's interior, so they
were. "How we can do this?" "I know. We'll

00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:11.310
make an acrylic phallus with a camera and
a light source and we'll have women have sex

00:35:11.310 --> 00:35:15.700
with it." And this is the '50s, and I remember
me going, "Sex research, my next book. That's

00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:21.340
it." I knew. I absolutely knew. So, sometimes
it's like that and other times it's kind of

00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:28.530
like something I heard and how could I build
a book around that or is there something there.

00:35:28.530 --> 00:35:34.450
And sometimes the germ of one book is in the
previous book. And I love ideas--maryroach.net,

00:35:34.450 --> 00:35:38.650
send me ideas. Yes.

00:35:38.650 --> 00:35:50.610
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #7: I hate to say something
like NASA has that sub-special department

00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:52.200
that [inaudible]

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:54.080
&gt;&gt;Mary Roach: Yes, I know those people.

00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:55.080
[Laughter]

00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:56.080
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #8: Are there stories
that you think are there that [inaudible]

00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:57.080
that we would not like?

00:35:57.080 --> 00:35:58.080
&gt;&gt;Mary Roach: Oh. Yes. There are millions
of one. I mean, NASA, the whole Space Program

00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:01.940
is just delightfully surreal and ludicrous.
I mean, look what we're doing. We're putting

00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:06.720
human beings up at this place where nothing
for them, where they don't belong. The engineering

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:13.490
challenges, the psychological challenges.
Plus it's a government organization. I would

00:36:13.490 --> 00:36:20.620
love for somebody as an insider to write a
wonderful book about NASA. Mike Mullane, the

00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:25.590
astronaut Mike Mullane did a book that was
pretty close to that. He really did. He was

00:36:25.590 --> 00:36:32.050
very forthcoming about the whole culture at
NASA and what it's like. I recommend that

00:36:32.050 --> 00:36:36.920
book as a sort of inside point of view. I
was an outsider, so I was struggling to get

00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:44.120
whatever little scraps I can. But I had this
sense that, yes, untold fabulous stories out

00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:46.120
there, waiting to be put into a book by somebody
who works there now. OK, one more question.

00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:47.120
Yes.

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:51.580
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #9: Can you talk about
how people deal with boredom in space?

00:36:51.580 --> 00:37:02.880
&gt;&gt;Mary Roach: The boredom in space? Yeah.
It's tough because there is not a lot recreational

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:09.470
opportunities. People bring musical instruments.
One of the Japanese astronauts brought a karaoke

00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:14.280
machine, which I think could possibly have
created some interesting psychological tension.

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:16.840
[Laughter]

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:25.010
I'm sure that e-readers--The Kindle had not
been passed for outgassing testing yet. Everything

00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:30.350
that flies out there get sent to this guy,
he's like NASA's nose, and he sniffs it and

00:37:30.350 --> 00:37:36.441
do these tests for volatiles, to make sure
there is nothing harmful coming off. And the

00:37:36.441 --> 00:37:41.400
Kindle had not yet been ytested, or any of
the other e-readers. There is reading, obviously,

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:47.630
but there is some time, particularly in the
long duration missions, there is not eight

00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:53.460
hours a day of work to be done and the boredom
was apparently, was part of the reasons some

00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:58.050
of the astronauts were very depressed. That
was the main contributing factor, was that

00:37:58.050 --> 00:38:02.730
there was nothing to do and the scenery never
changes. What?

00:38:02.730 --> 00:38:06.120
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #4: [inaudible]

00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:13.200
&gt;&gt;Mary Roach: Yes. Anything that's portable.
They have a weight cut-off for how much personal

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:20.770
stuff you can bring, but you can bring up
games, guitars. People have brought up, so.

00:38:20.770 --> 00:38:24.080
Certainly not a Ping-Pong table, for various
reasons, but--

00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:25.080
[Laughter]

00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:34.620
--maybe you'll figure out something up to
do with it different. Whatever you can bring,

00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:38.980
Sudoku, like portable stuff. Kind of like
a camping trip or a backpacking trip, where

00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:46.710
my husband and I always bring Travel Scrabble.
You bring something that's not going to put

00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:51.360
you over the limit on your weight requirement.
Yes.

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:54.190
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #10: Were there jugglers
or any kind of circus performers [inaudible]?

00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:57.120
&gt;&gt;Mary Roach: Were there jugglers or circus
performers? Someone brought a boomerang up

00:38:57.120 --> 00:39:03.790
on either the shuttle or the ISS. I thought,
who allowed that? Like hurling things around

00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:10.610
in a delicate machine. But interestingly enough
the boomerang flew OK. That doesn't make sense

00:39:10.610 --> 00:39:18.890
to me. I don't know why, I don't just think
it will work. A juggler, that would be a challenge.

00:39:18.890 --> 00:39:20.050
One more question. Yes.

00:39:20.050 --> 00:39:22.400
Oh, you were juggling.

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:23.400
[Laughter]

00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:24.400
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #10: [inaudible]

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:25.670
&gt;&gt;Mary Roach: I know. Yes.

00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:29.560
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #5: Speaking of the
footnotes, how do you keep focus on those

00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:34.290
wonderful archives? I could imagine ending
up being there for days.

00:39:34.290 --> 00:39:38.100
&gt;&gt;Mary Roach: Yes, How I do keep focus on
those wonderful archives? The trick is not

00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:41.420
keep focus, because when you get distracted
and you go off and you start flipping the

00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:46.040
pages of some old back issue on some journal
you find the most amazing things. You may

00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:52.070
find your next book in the pages. So I am
a big proponent of following your distractions.

00:39:52.070 --> 00:40:00.460
I am not a terribly productive person in an
archive or elsewhere, but I do allow myself

00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:05.840
the indulgence of going off on tangents. Thanks.
Thank you.

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:05.950
[Applause]
