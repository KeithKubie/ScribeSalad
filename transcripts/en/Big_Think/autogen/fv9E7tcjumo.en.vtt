well collectively we should just be
 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.330
well collectively we should just be
doing a lot more collectively we will

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340
doing a lot more collectively we will
 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.100
doing a lot more collectively we will
solve these problems much faster as a

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110
solve these problems much faster as a
 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.000
solve these problems much faster as a
wee than as a me so basically anything

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010
wee than as a me so basically anything
 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.099

people together the more they going to

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279
people together the more they going to
 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.560
people together the more they going to
find out what they have in common the

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570
find out what they have in common the
 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.790
find out what they have in common the
more they going to find out what we can

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800
more they going to find out what we can
 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.009
more they going to find out what we can
do about these problems so having more

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019
do about these problems so having more
 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.859
do about these problems so having more
we it's the most important thing we can

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869
we it's the most important thing we can

when I do something it has consequence
 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.560
when I do something it has consequence
and then the consequence try to

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570
and then the consequence try to
 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.000
and then the consequence try to
understand that we're part of a long

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010
understand that we're part of a long

connection causation now the fact is you

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670
connection causation now the fact is you
 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.340
connection causation now the fact is you
actually can't do it if you got up if

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350
actually can't do it if you got up if
 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.810
actually can't do it if you got up if
you get up tomorrow morning but what's

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820
you get up tomorrow morning but what's
 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.819
you get up tomorrow morning but what's
the first thing you do when you leave

teeth to think about all of the
 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.230
teeth to think about all of the
consequences that flow from the act of

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240
consequences that flow from the act of
 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.670
consequences that flow from the act of
brushing your teeth where did the metal

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680
brushing your teeth where did the metal
 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.960
brushing your teeth where did the metal
in the tube come from where did the

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970
in the tube come from where did the
 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.780
in the tube come from where did the
plastic come from how did the toothpaste

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790
plastic come from how did the toothpaste
 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.950
plastic come from how did the toothpaste
get to be white how is it brought to you

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960
get to be white how is it brought to you
 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.179
get to be white how is it brought to you
what happened to the workers have made

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189
what happened to the workers have made
 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.480
what happened to the workers have made
it where the water come from how is it

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490
it where the water come from how is it
 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.340
it where the water come from how is it
stored how is it transported where is it

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350
stored how is it transported where is it
 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.240

going the electrons that light your face

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250
going the electrons that light your face
 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.639
going the electrons that light your face
so you don't just like make a mess of

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649
so you don't just like make a mess of
 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.590
so you don't just like make a mess of
yourself how did that happen try to

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600
yourself how did that happen try to
 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.170
yourself how did that happen try to
think of all the chains of causation

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180
think of all the chains of causation
 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.910
think of all the chains of causation
that you're a part of you will not be

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920
that you're a part of you will not be
 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.649
that you're a part of you will not be
able to do it if we could all twice a

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659
able to do it if we could all twice a
 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.190
able to do it if we could all twice a
day put ourselves through that exercise

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200
day put ourselves through that exercise
 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.830
day put ourselves through that exercise
I think we would be less certain than

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840
I think we would be less certain than
 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.350
I think we would be less certain than
therefore probably wiser we would

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360
therefore probably wiser we would
 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.020
therefore probably wiser we would
understand that

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030
 
 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.020
 
we should tread more gently
