00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:05.223
The answer is 11ab squared c, plus 3ab,

00:00:05.223 --> 00:00:09.043
plus 9abc squared, plus 4c.

00:00:09.043 --> 00:00:13.780
We can simplify this the same way
that we did in the previous example.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.700
Let's find all the like terms and
combine them.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:22.580
Ab squared c and
10ab squared c are like terms.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.970
And it looks like there
are no other like terms, so

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.590
everything else can stay how it is,
and we'll just rearrange these so

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.470
the like terms are next to each other.

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.830
So after a bit of rearranging, we get
ab squared c, plus 10ab squared c,

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.400
plus 3ab, plus 9abc squared, plus 4c.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:48.100
Now we can combine our like terms, which
are ab squared c and 10ab squared c.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.720
Note that if there is no coefficient
shown in front of a variable,

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.700
the coefficient is implied to be 1.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.942
So ab squared c,
actually equals one ab squared c.

00:00:59.942 --> 00:01:05.974
That means that when we combine
10ab squared c, with ab squared c,

00:01:05.974 --> 00:01:12.022
we're actually combining 10ab squared c,
with one ab squared c.

00:01:12.022 --> 00:01:14.810
Which gives us 11ab squared c.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.452
We can't combine any coefficients for
these other terms, so

00:01:21.452 --> 00:01:23.751
they just stay how they are.

00:01:23.751 --> 00:01:28.738
And our final answer is 11ab squared c,
plus 3ab, plus 9abc squared, plus 4c.

00:01:28.738 --> 00:01:31.929
