00:00:06.864 --> 00:00:10.657
When we talk about English,
we often think of it as a single language

00:00:10.657 --> 00:00:14.997
but what do the dialects spoken
in dozens of countries around the world

00:00:14.997 --> 00:00:17.050
have in common with each other,

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.980
or with the writings of Chaucer?

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.028
And how are any of them related
to the strange words in Beowulf?

00:00:23.028 --> 00:00:25.271
The answer is that like most languages,

00:00:25.271 --> 00:00:28.326
English has evolved 
through generations of speakers,

00:00:28.326 --> 00:00:31.307
undergoing major changes over time.

00:00:31.307 --> 00:00:33.340
By undoing these changes,

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.779
we can trace the language 
from the present day

00:00:35.779 --> 00:00:38.403
back to its ancient roots.

00:00:38.403 --> 00:00:40.536
While modern English 
shares many similar words

00:00:40.536 --> 00:00:42.938
with Latin-derived romance languages,

00:00:42.938 --> 00:00:44.582
like French and Spanish,

00:00:44.582 --> 00:00:47.723
most of those words 
were not originally part of it.

00:00:47.723 --> 00:00:50.271
Instead, they started coming 
into the language

00:00:50.271 --> 00:00:55.087
with the Norman invasion 
of England in 1066.

00:00:55.087 --> 00:00:57.632
When the French-speaking Normans
conquered England

00:00:57.632 --> 00:00:59.649
and became its ruling class,

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:01.793
they brought their speech with them,

00:01:01.793 --> 00:01:05.267
adding a massive amount 
of French and Latin vocabulary

00:01:05.267 --> 00:01:08.286
to the English language 
previously spoken there.

00:01:08.286 --> 00:01:11.049
Today, we call that language Old English.

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:13.495
This is the language of Beowulf.

00:01:13.495 --> 00:01:15.609
It probably doesn't look very familiar,

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:19.915
but it might be more recognizable
if you know some German.

00:01:19.915 --> 00:01:23.807
That's because Old English
belongs to the Germanic language family,

00:01:23.807 --> 00:01:27.595
first brought to the British Isles
in the 5th and 6th centuries

00:01:27.595 --> 00:01:31.179
by the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes.

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:35.901
The Germanic dialects they spoke would
become known as Anglo-Saxon.

00:01:35.901 --> 00:01:38.931
Viking invaders in the 8th 
to 11th centuries

00:01:38.931 --> 00:01:42.943
added more borrowings 
from Old Norse into the mix.

00:01:42.943 --> 00:01:45.771
It may be hard to see the roots
of modern English

00:01:45.771 --> 00:01:47.634
underneath all the words borrowed

00:01:47.634 --> 00:01:51.738
from French, Latin, Old Norse 
and other languages.

00:01:51.738 --> 00:01:56.904
But comparative linguistics can help us
by focusing on grammatical structure,

00:01:56.904 --> 00:01:58.733
patterns of sound changes,

00:01:58.733 --> 00:02:01.175
and certain core vocabulary.

00:02:01.175 --> 00:02:03.682
For example, after the 6th century,

00:02:03.682 --> 00:02:09.011
German words starting with "p,"
systematically shifted to a "pf" sound

00:02:09.011 --> 00:02:13.109
while their Old English counterparts
kept the "p" unchanged.

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:16.977
In another split, words 
that have "sk" sounds in Swedish

00:02:16.977 --> 00:02:20.394
developed an "sh" sound in English.

00:02:20.394 --> 00:02:23.236
There are still some English 
words with "sk,"

00:02:23.236 --> 00:02:25.257
like "skirt," and "skull,"

00:02:25.257 --> 00:02:27.988
but they're direct borrowings 
from Old Norse

00:02:27.988 --> 00:02:31.781
that came after the "sk" to "sh" shift.

00:02:31.781 --> 00:02:33.710
These examples show us

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.628
that just as the various Romance languages
descended from Latin,

00:02:37.628 --> 00:02:41.603
English, Swedish, German, 
and many other languages

00:02:41.603 --> 00:02:46.006
descended from their own common ancestor
known as Proto-Germanic

00:02:46.006 --> 00:02:48.854
spoken around 500 B.C.E.

00:02:48.854 --> 00:02:52.301
Because this historical language
was never written down,

00:02:52.301 --> 00:02:56.184
we can only reconstruct it 
by comparing its descendants,

00:02:56.184 --> 00:02:59.302
which is possible thanks 
to the consistency of the changes.

00:02:59.302 --> 00:03:03.671
We can even use the same process
to go back one step further,

00:03:03.671 --> 00:03:09.741
and trace the origins of Proto-Germanic
to a language called Proto-Indo-European,

00:03:09.741 --> 00:03:11.922
spoken about 6000 years ago

00:03:11.922 --> 00:03:16.512
on the Pontic steppe 
in modern day Ukraine and Russia.

00:03:16.512 --> 00:03:20.843
This is the reconstructed ancestor
of the Indo-European family

00:03:20.843 --> 00:03:25.371
that includes nearly all languages
historically spoken in Europe,

00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:28.711
as well as large parts of Southern
and Western Asia.

00:03:28.711 --> 00:03:31.453
And though it requires a bit more work,

00:03:31.453 --> 00:03:35.890
we can find the same systematic 
similarities, or correspondences,

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.864
between related words in different
Indo-European branches.

00:03:39.864 --> 00:03:42.085
Comparing English with Latin,

00:03:42.085 --> 00:03:45.690
we see that English has "t" 
where Latin has "d",

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.728
and "f" where latin has "p"
at the start of words.

00:03:49.728 --> 00:03:53.681
Some of English's more distant relatives
include Hindi, Persian

00:03:53.681 --> 00:03:58.109
and the Celtic languages it displaced
in what is now Britain.

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:02.769
Proto-Indo-European itself descended
from an even more ancient language,

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:07.908
but unfortunately, this is as far back
as historical and archeological evidence

00:04:07.908 --> 00:04:10.088
will allow us to go.

00:04:10.088 --> 00:04:12.280
Many mysteries remain just out of reach,

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.658
such as whether there might be a link
between Indo-European

00:04:15.658 --> 00:04:17.842
and other major language families,

00:04:17.842 --> 00:04:22.522
and the nature of the languages spoken
in Europe prior to its arrival.

00:04:22.522 --> 00:04:27.418
But the amazing fact remains that nearly
3 billion people around the world,

00:04:27.418 --> 00:04:29.980
many of whom cannot understand each other,

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:36.360
are nevertheless speaking the same words
shaped by 6000 years of history.
