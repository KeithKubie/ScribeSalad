00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:14.679
In this short video,

00:00:14.703 --> 00:00:17.144
we're going to show you
how we used animation

00:00:17.168 --> 00:00:19.502
to make custom playing
cards to do magical tricks

00:00:19.526 --> 00:00:22.643
in TED-Ed's Lesson on synesthesia.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.163
Synesthesia is a neurological condition

00:00:29.187 --> 00:00:31.456
in which two or more
senses are paired together

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.269
to create a completely new experience.

00:00:34.293 --> 00:00:36.528
For example, many synesthetes see letters

00:00:36.552 --> 00:00:38.203
and numbers in colors,

00:00:38.227 --> 00:00:40.171
even when they are printed in black.

00:00:40.195 --> 00:00:42.602
Or they can taste certain words.

00:00:42.626 --> 00:00:46.161
For instance, jail tastes like bacon.

00:00:46.185 --> 00:00:48.171
Because synesthesia generally involves

00:00:48.195 --> 00:00:50.611
the brain pairing up two or more senses,

00:00:50.635 --> 00:00:51.887
we paired up playing cards

00:00:51.911 --> 00:00:52.643
with unique,

00:00:52.667 --> 00:00:53.260
colorful,

00:00:53.284 --> 00:00:54.970
and visceral symbols.

00:00:54.994 --> 00:00:56.661
We then used an animation technique

00:00:56.685 --> 00:00:58.004
called stop motion

00:00:58.028 --> 00:00:59.735
to manipulate the cards in ways

00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:02.480
that would be otherwise
physically impossible.

00:01:02.504 --> 00:01:04.021
And as the cards were flipping,

00:01:04.045 --> 00:01:04.483
shuffling,

00:01:04.507 --> 00:01:05.525
and sliding,

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.899
we used a mixture of animation and reality

00:01:07.923 --> 00:01:09.861
to ensure that the symbols on the cards

00:01:09.885 --> 00:01:13.696
did their part to explain
the nuances of synesthesia.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.197
This type of animation is very
difficult to pull off

00:01:16.221 --> 00:01:18.214
without some planning first.

00:01:21.161 --> 00:01:23.709
A storyboard is a series of still images

00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:25.654
that basically serve as a road map

00:01:25.678 --> 00:01:28.379
for an animation from beginning to end.

00:01:28.403 --> 00:01:31.501
An animatic is a storyboard in motion.

00:01:31.525 --> 00:01:32.493
By making the animatic,

00:01:32.517 --> 00:01:35.699
we were able to review the digital
motion for each shot,

00:01:35.723 --> 00:01:38.104
which allowed us to progressively
work out timing,

00:01:38.128 --> 00:01:39.184
camera positioning,

00:01:39.208 --> 00:01:40.378
and, most importantly,

00:01:40.402 --> 00:01:42.112
any challenges we anticipated

00:01:42.136 --> 00:01:44.766
in the final animation process.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.594
How many hands do you need
to shuffle a deck of cards?

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.995
Here, we wanted to emphasize
each nucleotide

00:01:56.019 --> 00:01:57.491
in the DNA sequence

00:01:57.515 --> 00:02:00.156
and stop motion allows for more control.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.331
By shuffling between individual frames,

00:02:02.355 --> 00:02:03.948
we could ensure that each card

00:02:03.972 --> 00:02:06.567
had a controlled amount of screen time,

00:02:06.591 --> 00:02:08.209
in this case, three frames,

00:02:08.233 --> 00:02:11.674
and that the card's placement
was consistent.

00:02:11.698 --> 00:02:14.614
But sometimes four hands
just isn't enough.

00:02:19.067 --> 00:02:20.925
We use this trick a lot in this lesson,

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:23.259
all thanks to one secret ingredient:

00:02:23.283 --> 00:02:24.696
Play-Doh!

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.555
By molding the Play-Doh
into different sized pyramids,

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:29.760
the cards can be held
in different positions,

00:02:29.784 --> 00:02:31.844
always keeping the pyramid big enough

00:02:31.868 --> 00:02:33.234
to support the card,

00:02:33.258 --> 00:02:34.818
but small enough to not be seen

00:02:34.842 --> 00:02:37.903
and to not cast its own revealing shadow.

00:03:10.251 --> 00:03:11.632
Making an animated movie

00:03:11.656 --> 00:03:13.697
is like making a delicious layer cake.

00:03:13.721 --> 00:03:14.815
It's up to the animators

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:17.471
to create the many planes, or layers.

00:03:17.495 --> 00:03:18.731
The use of green screen

00:03:18.755 --> 00:03:21.739
enables us to shoot
individual elements moving,

00:03:21.763 --> 00:03:23.506
and to later assemble those layers

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.447
one on top of the other.

00:03:25.471 --> 00:03:28.245
Using software, we key
out the green color,

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:29.242
both on the background

00:03:29.266 --> 00:03:30.900
and Play-Doh.

00:03:30.924 --> 00:03:31.879
Layer the cards,

00:03:31.903 --> 00:03:32.913
add the hands,

00:03:32.937 --> 00:03:34.708
insert a background,

00:03:34.732 --> 00:03:36.923
and if you planned
your ingredients carefully,

00:03:36.947 --> 00:03:39.935
everything should come
together just right.

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.305
So, grab some fishing wire,

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:41.970
glue,

00:03:41.994 --> 00:03:42.713
masking tape,

00:03:42.737 --> 00:03:43.768
chopsticks,

00:03:43.792 --> 00:03:45.520
and whatever else you can find.

00:03:45.544 --> 00:03:47.544
We'd love to see you make some of your own

00:03:47.568 --> 00:03:49.576
animated illusions.
