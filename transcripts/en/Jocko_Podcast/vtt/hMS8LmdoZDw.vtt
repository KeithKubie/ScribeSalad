1
00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:05.110
In podcasts 50 for the armed forces officer.
Remember that book?

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.930
The Armed Forces officer?
Yeah.
Yeah.
One of my feet.
1950 edition.
Yeah.

3
00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.490
Can you expound on the difference between these two?

4
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.510
These two seemingly contradictory quotes from the manual?

5
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.200
A firm hold at the beginning pays 10 fold dividend of the timid approach

6
00:00:22.541 --> 00:00:27.250
followed by a show of firmness later on from general Malone story of a World War

7
00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:28.690
One compared with

8
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:29.780
<v 1>and General Malone's.</v>

9
00:00:29.781 --> 00:00:34.310
If you remember the story was there's like mad messed up unit and he went in

10
00:00:34.311 --> 00:00:35.000
there was like,
all right,

11
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.700
get squared away because these boards in place get out of the mud.

12
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.590
What you need to get your uniforms together.

13
00:00:39.591 --> 00:00:42.020
Just tighten them up out of the gate.
Like firmness,

14
00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.650
firmness really out of the gate.
Yeah.
And then compare it to,

15
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.430
<v 0>to um,
okay.
Here's the quote.</v>

16
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.200
It's a mistake for an officer on taking a new post to order sweeping changes

17
00:00:52.201 --> 00:00:55.620
affecting the other men in the belief that this will give him a reputation for

18
00:00:55.621 --> 00:00:57.060
action and firmness.

19
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.090
The studying of situations is the overture of the studying of it and that's from

20
00:01:03.241 --> 00:01:04.040
General Lemay

21
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.180
<v 1>in general or May.
If you remember that one,
he said,
hey,</v>

22
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.080
none of you guys would be in these positions unless you were doing things right.

23
00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.900
So I assume that you're doing a good job and we're going to continue what you're

24
00:01:14.901 --> 00:01:16.370
doing.
That's what he said when he took over.

25
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.730
So what's going on here is you've got two completely different situations and

26
00:01:19.731 --> 00:01:24.170
the two situations are,
one is a guy taking over for a situation,

27
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.980
unknown bad situation.
The troops are lacking discipline,

28
00:01:27.981 --> 00:01:30.950
they're not executing the mission.
And if you remember from that story,

29
00:01:30.951 --> 00:01:33.620
they weren't even doing basic military bearing.
They didn't,

30
00:01:33.621 --> 00:01:35.030
they weren't saluting the officers.

31
00:01:35.031 --> 00:01:37.100
They just hadn't thrown everything out the window.

32
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.040
That's a situation you've got to come and you've got to get from out of the
gate.

33
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.910
That's what you gotta do.
Now they got to know that.

34
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.360
They got to know that things are gonna Change.
They got to know it's real.

35
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.290
They got to know there's a new plan and they've got to know what that new plan

36
00:01:51.291 --> 00:01:52.124
is.

37
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.800
And then they got to know that there's new standards and they got to know what

38
00:01:54.801 --> 00:01:58.460
the new standards are.
Boom,
and it's the same thing.
You know,
Hackworth.

39
00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.910
He did that.
He came in with some,
you know,
if you remember when he took over the,

40
00:02:02.911 --> 00:02:05.570
the hardcore battalion,
what became the hardcore battalion,

41
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.410
the first thing he did was like all those radios and guitars and all this crap

42
00:02:09.411 --> 00:02:10.580
that you have sitting around base.

43
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.700
Put it all in the middle of the base tomorrow and we're getting rid of it all.

44
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.290
That was a big change.
Now Hackworth.

45
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.900
Then he,
then he started implementing two changes a day.
If you remember,
Hey,

46
00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.810
got to get everyone,
carry your weapon at all times.
That's the neck change.
Okay,

47
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.520
get your helmet.
Okay,
now we've got to get helmet covers on it.
He just made one,

48
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.670
one or two small changes a day after he made some big sweeping changes out of

49
00:02:34.671 --> 00:02:38.540
the gate because it was a jacked up battalion and now,

50
00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.010
now the differences,

51
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.080
if you're going into a situation where everything's going fine or okay or at a

52
00:02:45.081 --> 00:02:46.670
bare minimum,
it's like normal.

53
00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.810
Well then you don't need to step in there and show that you're the man by making

54
00:02:50.811 --> 00:02:54.440
these sweeping changes.
You don't need to do that.
It comes across,

55
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.940
it comes across like the people that you just took charge of.

56
00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.380
I have no idea what they're doing and get you.
You don't respect what they,

57
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.290
what they,
what their methodology.
You don't respect their,

58
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.920
their performance because you're coming in and saying,
oh echo,
by the way,

59
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.540
the way you report the cord,
the podcast,

60
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.450
you need to get rid of those microphones.
You need to edit it tighter,

61
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.360
your basis to,
you know,
what would you be thinking if I came in and said that?

62
00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:18.750
<v 2>Well,
you know</v>

63
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.580
<v 1>mean little bit different,
but you know,
I understand your pain point being.</v>

64
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.970
If somebody comes in and starts criticizing you right when you're doing okay,

65
00:03:27.971 --> 00:03:31.750
when you're doing a good job,
know you're doing a good job.
Yeah.
Nice.

66
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:32.980
I think you're doing a good job.
Thanks.

67
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.410
There's something that get on you about that base.
Occasionally.

68
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.730
That's your head that's really on you.
You know you're passing your base book.

69
00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.390
Extreme ownership on my part.
So that's the thing.

70
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.320
If that's the decision you've gotta make,
and guess what?

71
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.220
It's not black and white.
You don't go into some units.

72
00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.460
It's not like you're going to get a choice between a unit that's doing horrible

73
00:03:54.461 --> 00:03:55.750
and a unit that's doing great.

74
00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.410
You're going to get everything in between and therefore you have to modulate

75
00:03:59.411 --> 00:04:01.960
your leadership to reflect.
If it's a,

76
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.620
if it's a group that might have a tendency of being a little bit jacked up and

77
00:04:05.621 --> 00:04:06.790
they're getting close,
guess what?

78
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.790
You got to got to be maybe not sweeping changes,

79
00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:11.670
but you might need to make a little statement,
right?

80
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.870
If it's a group that's performing awesome,
fantastic top,
top,
team,

81
00:04:16.871 --> 00:04:19.090
top,
whatever,
you might need to come and say,
hey guys,

82
00:04:19.091 --> 00:04:20.170
I see that you're doing great.

83
00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.140
I'm here to just keep you guys doing what you're doing.

84
00:04:23.141 --> 00:04:25.210
Let me know what you need to support.
Boom.

85
00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.420
And it could be anywhere in between that,
that spectrum.

86
00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.160
That's why leadership is challenging,
cause you've gotta be old.

87
00:04:32.161 --> 00:04:35.320
You got to have nuance.
You gotta be able to modulate.
Yeah.

88
00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.590
You got to figure out where that is and you've got to test it out to.

89
00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.720
Once you give that sweeping order,
you've got to see what kind of reaction you

90
00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:42.613
<v 2>got it.</v>

91
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.870
<v 1>You know,
you got to see two people just instantly rebel.
Okay,</v>

92
00:04:46.871 --> 00:04:49.330
then let's talk this.
Let's get some feedback.
What's going on?

93
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.330
Clearly we have a disrespect scenario going on.

94
00:04:52.331 --> 00:04:54.310
When did you get the bottom of this?
Let me get some key leaders in here.

95
00:04:54.311 --> 00:04:55.690
Let me talk to them,
get some feedback,

96
00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.720
which you should do that before you make any sweeping changes anyway.

97
00:04:58.721 --> 00:05:02.170
You've got to at least talk to the key leadership,
get them in the game,

98
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.820
get them on board.
Yeah,
that's why leadership is awesome.
That's why I beat,

99
00:05:06.821 --> 00:05:08.920
that's why this stuff is so fun because it's challenging.

100
00:05:08.921 --> 00:05:12.500
It's different every single time yet feels like,
um,

101
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.870
kind of like what we were talking about earlier where if you start to understand

102
00:05:16.871 --> 00:05:17.710
the formula,

103
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.090
all the different details that come out and you can kind of apply the formula in

104
00:05:21.091 --> 00:05:23.830
one way and even then still dynamic,
but,
but you can,

105
00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:25.330
you can just get a better grasp.

106
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.740
It's just like Jujitsu because if you understand the concept,
yeah,
that's,

107
00:05:29.741 --> 00:05:30.820
you have to be able to move your hips.

108
00:05:30.821 --> 00:05:32.670
There's a bunch of different ways you can get your hips moving.

109
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.910
If you understand the concept that you need to do,

110
00:05:34.911 --> 00:05:37.840
we'll mobilize the hips to pass the guard.
If you understand that concept,

111
00:05:37.841 --> 00:05:38.980
there's all kinds of different ways you can do.

112
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:44.130
If you understand the concept of totally jacked up team is going to need a

113
00:05:44.231 --> 00:05:47.740
sweeping change to get their attention and get them to understand that things

114
00:05:47.741 --> 00:05:49.630
are gonna change and what they were doing was unacceptable.

115
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.870
If you understand that concept that that's what it's gonna take,

116
00:05:52.871 --> 00:05:57.070
you can apply it all the way through those gradiations all the way down to,
hey,

117
00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:59.230
this team is doing great and I don't need to change much.

118
00:05:59.231 --> 00:06:03.640
I just need to give him the support that they need.
Conceptual instruction,

119
00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.360
very important.
Solid.
