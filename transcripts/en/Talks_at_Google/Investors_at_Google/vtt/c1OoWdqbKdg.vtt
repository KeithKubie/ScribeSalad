[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.357 --> 00:00:10.440
JORDAN THIBODEAU: So thank
you all for joining us.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.140
I'd like to introduce
you to Ray Dalio.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.300
He's the founder of
Bridgewater Associates.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.460
He founded that 1975.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.320
And it is one of the
most successful hedge

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.610
funds in history.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.480
So let's give Ray a
nice Google welcome.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.450
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.470
RAY DALIO: I'm in
a stage in my life

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.390
where I'm entering what I call
the third stage of my life.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.100
I think of life as existing
in three big stages.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.670
The first is that you're
learning from others.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.890
You're dependent on others.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:47.895
You're a kid.

00:00:47.895 --> 00:00:52.380
The second stage of your
life is then you're working.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.870
Others are dependent on you.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.540
And you're trying
to be successful.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.770
Then after, you get to
the later stage in life.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.750
Third stage of
your life is others

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.910
are successful without you.

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.560
And that you're free--

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.870
according to Joseph
Campbell free

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.880
to live and free to die, OK?

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.340
So that you have that
element of freedom.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.610
And so I'm at a stage
in my life where--

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:25.800
I started Bridgewater out of a
two-bedroom apartment in 1975,

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.560
and I've brought it
to where it is now.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.910
According to "Fortune," it's
the fifth most important

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:34.650
private company in
the United States.

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:35.610
It's been successful.

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.960
It's been good.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.680
And that my objective
at this particular stage

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.990
is to help others be
successful without me.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.030
I learned along the
way certain principles.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.030
Every time I would
make a decision,

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.780
I would write down the reasons
I would make that decision.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.620
And I put them out.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.180
I debated them.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.810
And I developed
these principles.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.245
So think about
principles as just

00:02:04.245 --> 00:02:06.370
being these reasons for
making a decision if you're

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.539
in this situation, how
do you deal with it?

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.260
It was also very
important to me to operate

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.920
in a very unusual way that
seemed very sensible to me.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.170
And it's an idea
meritocratic way.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.240
So I want to
describe Bridgewater

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.050
as being an idea
meritocracy-- in other words,

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.360
a real idea meritocracy, which
I'll explain and show to you,

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.080
so a real idea meritocracy
in which the goals are

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.260
meaningful work and
meaningful relationships.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.720
Meaningful work-- I mean
you're on a mission,

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.850
that you feel you're
on a mission together

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.310
to do those great things.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.330
And meaningful
relationships, meaning

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:47.680
that you care about each other.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.892
It's part of a community.

00:02:48.892 --> 00:02:50.350
And to be on that
mission together.

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.770
And that was really great
in terms of our success.

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.070
But it was meaningful work
and meaningful relationships

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:02.080
through radical truthfulness
and radical transparency.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.050
That means, literally,
people saying anything

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.010
that they feel that they want
to say in terms of being polite,

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.730
of course, but sharing what
they really believe is true

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.580
and working themselves through
to have an idea meritocratic

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.650
way and to literally record
everything for everybody

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:21.640
to hear.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.690
So I mean, literally, there
are a combination of videos

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.310
and tapes of all meetings
that happen so that nothing

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.830
is hidden, because you
can't have a real idea

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.900
meritocracy if you can't
see things yourself.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.240
And so it's a very
unusual place,

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.540
and it was really the
basis of our success.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.750
And I want to explain
that way of operating

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.240
to you because this idea
meritocratic way, in which

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.630
there's meaningful work and
meaningful relationships

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.140
through radical truthfulness
and radical transparency

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.230
so that you could have
thoughtful disagreement

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.310
and have ways of getting past
that disagreement to then move

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:04.900
on, like a legal system.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.400
That has been the
key to our success.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.954
So that's what I want
to try to convey to you.

00:04:09.954 --> 00:04:11.620
And I'm just going
to take a few minutes

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.030
to try to go
through a few slides

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.010
to give you a sense of this.

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.500
I wanted big, audacious goals.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.079
I wish big, audacious
goals for you.

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:21.579
Go after your goals

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.800
And on your way to
your goals, you're

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.972
going to encounter your problems
and your failures, right?

00:04:27.972 --> 00:04:28.930
That's going to happen.

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.620
Otherwise you just go
straight to your goals.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.790
No.

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.000
That's the learning process.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.700
You account in your failures.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.980
Failures is part of
the learning process.

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:41.080
From the failures,
what I found was great.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.410
I started to think of
failures as lessons.

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.240
I started to think
of them as puzzles

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.900
rather than develop emotional
reactions to those failures.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.130
I started think, pain
plus quality reflection

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.990
would give me progress.

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:06.770
So I started to think of almost
the failures like puzzles

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.130
that if I could study the
puzzles, the puzzles was,

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.680
what would I do
differently in the future

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.310
that wouldn't produce that
problem again when it happened?

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:18.900
And then I would reflect--

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.340
well, what was that?

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:21.870
That would be my principles.

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.940
What would I do
differently in the future?

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.940
If I solved that puzzle,
I would get a gem.

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.610
And the gem was
principle, a principle

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.140
to handle it better
in the future,

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.580
because failure is
a learning process.

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.540
It's an essential part
of the learning process.

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.290
If you can realize
that and you write down

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.490
those principles--
write them down.

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:42.920
It's been fantastic.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.750
So we'd learn those principles.

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.760
And then it would
help me improve.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.370
And then I would go on
to more audacious goals.

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.785
And I look at evolution--
personal evolution

00:05:51.785 --> 00:05:53.810
or almost every
evolution-- evolution

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:56.450
of a company, evolution
of everything,

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:00.560
as being this constant looping
process that I sort of think

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.860
of as this five-step process.

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.860
In other words, to be
successful, you have to out

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.450
you have to do five things.

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.460
First, you have to know
what your goals are

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.190
and go after those goals.

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:14.870
Be clear on your goals.

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.730
And you will encounter problems
on the way to those goals.

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.180
Those will be your barriers, OK?

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.630
There are tests now.

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:23.560
Don't just emotionally complain.

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.610
Think about them
as your problems.

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:29.270
You have to diagnose those
problems to the root cause

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:31.070
to get at the root cause.

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:33.080
And that root cause
might be yourself,

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.540
what you're doing wrong or what
somebody else is doing wrong.

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.480
So you can't depersonalize it.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:42.410
You have to really look at it
so that you make those changes.

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:44.360
And when you get
at that root cause,

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.480
only by knowing that
root cause can then you

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.300
design a way to get
around that root cause.

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.520
Like, if you're not good
at something yourself,

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.090
it's OK if you find somebody
else who's good at the things

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:58.370
that you're not good at
because nobody can be good

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:00.440
at everything, right?

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:01.670
But you have to do that.

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:04.700
You just can't keep banging
yourself on the wall.

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:08.150
So you have to design something
that's practical to get around

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:08.840
with it.

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:12.090
And then you have to
follow through and do it.

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:13.640
A lot of people come
up with designs,

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.160
but you have to do the
thing that's necessary.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.580
And by trying that thing
that's necessary, again ,

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:23.195
you will find out, are you
getting to your goals or are

00:07:23.195 --> 00:07:25.520
you encountering your next
set of problems and so on?

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:29.150
And that, I believe, is the
personal evolutionary process

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:30.140
that has helped me.

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:33.500
Those rules that I
was able to write down

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.590
and that you can get in this
book, "Principles," which

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:38.990
is why I'm passing them along.

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:41.930
Those rules-- we were
actually able to then

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:46.640
put into the algorithms and
build decision-making processes

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.180
that replicate the brain.

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:50.270
We'll get into that in a minute.

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:56.090
OK, so in order to be
successful in the markets,

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:58.040
one has to be an
independent thinker.

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:01.310
In order to be an
entrepreneur, one

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:05.090
has to be an independent thinker
and bet against the consensus

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:08.300
and be right, because the
consensus in the markets

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:10.650
is built into the price.

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:13.540
Whatever anybody thinks,
it's built into the price.

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:17.075
So you have to bet
against the consensus.

00:08:17.075 --> 00:08:19.200
And you're going to be
wrong a fair amount of times

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.700
about betting against
the consensus.

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:23.700
But in any case, you need to
be an independent thinker.

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:25.980
And for an
entrepreneur, you need

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:28.560
to be an independent
thinker, because you're

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:29.520
inventing new stuff.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:30.600
You're doing something.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.460
And you don't know
if you're right.

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:34.620
So in order for me
to be successful,

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:37.890
I needed to have a bunch
of independent thinkers

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:41.065
in order to have
them be effective.

00:08:41.065 --> 00:08:42.690
OK, well, now, how
are you going to get

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:44.670
this bunch of
independent thinkers

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:47.070
to agree on anything, OK?

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:50.950
I had to have an
idea meritocracy.

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:54.270
In other words, I had to
have a system that literally,

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:58.510
systematically allows for
thoughtful disagreement

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:01.680
so that this idea
meritocratic people could then

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.200
get at the right answer,
because that's fantastic

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.426
if you can have that
thoughtful disagreement

00:09:06.426 --> 00:09:07.550
to get at the right answer.

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:08.850
It's very powerful.

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:11.460
By having that and
then systematizing it--

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:12.870
principled systems--

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:15.710
a system for having thoughtful
disagreement for an idea

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:16.980
meritocracy--

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:19.560
we could produce greater
amounts of successes.

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.660
We also produced failures.

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:24.780
But we would look at that
way, produce our learnings.

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:29.250
And that produced, as a result,
happy employees who really

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:31.440
believe in this idea
meritocratic thing

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:34.590
and owned the company,
intellectually and otherwise,

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:35.640
own the company.

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.350
And we had happy employees.

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:41.010
And then it became easier to
attract those types of people,

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:43.950
those types of people who
believe that everybody has

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:45.660
the right to make
sense of things

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:48.360
and that there's a power
in thoughtful disagreement.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.820
And that allowed us to
attract more people,

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:53.910
and that was the basis of going
from the two-bedroom apartment

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:55.650
to Bridgewater now.

00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:59.340
So now we have
about 1,500 people,

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:02.830
and that's how it works
as an idea meritocracy.

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:05.520
And I want to pass
that along to you,

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:08.460
and I want to say, OK, so
what is an idea meritocracy?

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:10.320
You could have your
own versions of this.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.040
You pick what is fine to you.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.490
But three different things
are necessary for an idea

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:15.780
meritocracy.

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:19.290
First, everybody has to
put their honest thoughts

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:22.170
on the table to see.

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:25.590
Now, I watch this, and I think
it's so many organizations, so

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:26.400
many people--

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:29.220
they all keep it bottled
up in their heads, right?

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.030
And they're critical
behind the scenes.

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:38.870
And that's bad.

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:42.380
So can you put your
honest thoughts

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:45.380
on the table with other
people's honest thoughts

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:49.364
so that you understand what
people are thinking, OK?

00:10:49.364 --> 00:10:50.780
It makes everything,
first of all,

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:52.414
a lot more efficient, right?

00:10:52.414 --> 00:10:54.830
It's terribly inefficient when
everybody doesn't know what

00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:56.420
the other person's thinking.

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:59.270
And then also, it
doesn't allow ownership.

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:03.034
It can't be an idea
meritocracy if you just

00:11:03.034 --> 00:11:03.950
don't work it through.

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:05.812
Everybody's talking
behind the scenes.

00:11:05.812 --> 00:11:07.520
We don't allow talking
behind the scenes,

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:10.530
but anybody can challenge
anything at any time.

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:13.970
OK, then you have to
understand the art

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:19.020
of thoughtful disagreement,
thoughtful disagreement.

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:21.950
So many people react
badly to disagreement.

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:24.140
You have to change
the modus operandi

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:25.430
and start your thinking.

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:28.820
It should be curiosity how
do you know who's right?

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:31.130
How do you know who is wrong?

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:34.190
It should prompt
curiosity not anger.

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:36.740
It tends to produce
to some extent anger

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:39.530
because it's like a
barbaric animal behavior

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:41.880
that what happens is
the amygdala part of us

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.910
has this flight or flight thing.

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:46.730
And then that it's
viewed as an attack.

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:49.460
And that's not good.

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:52.800
So there are
protocols that we have

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.800
that I won't go into now
that I don't have time,

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:57.590
but they're are laid
out in the book of how

00:11:57.590 --> 00:12:00.350
do you have the art of
thoughtful disagreement

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:02.300
to raise the probabilities?

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:07.280
Because collectively, if
you have an idea meritocracy

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:09.620
and you know how to do
this well collectively,

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:13.300
you're going to make much better
decisions than individually.

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:15.470
If you just are stuck with
the information that's

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:19.040
in your head and your
opinions, that's terrible.

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:22.580
I believe that one of the
greatest tragedies of mankind--

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:26.180
such an easy thing to fix--

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:29.630
is the people who are stuck with
wrong opinions in their heads

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:32.780
that they don't put out
there and stress test

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:35.150
and raise their
probabilities of being right.

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:40.550
So you have to understand the
art of thoughtful disagreement

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:43.670
that brings in better
thinking than you individually

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:47.420
has and has a probability of
moving you to a better answer

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:49.340
than you would
have individually.

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:51.420
That requires a skill.

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:55.730
And so then you have
the disagreement.

00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:57.140
That collective
decision-making's

00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:57.830
very powerful.

00:12:57.830 --> 00:12:58.910
It's done well.

00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:03.470
But you might still have a
disagreement after those things

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:07.190
Then you have to have
agreed upon ways of getting

00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:08.870
past your disagreement.

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:12.290
If you have your disagreements
that are gnawing at you

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:14.570
and so on, it's like a
law case, a legal case.

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:15.290
OK, you go in.

00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:16.100
You have a trial.

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:17.420
You do it.

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:21.050
But you believe that the
decision-making system is fair.

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:22.760
And because you
believe it's fair

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:26.750
and you've had that
opportunity, that you say,

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:28.400
now we can get past
the disagreement

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.930
and move on, rather than
being stuck with it.

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:33.920
So those are the three things
that an idea meritocracy

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:36.260
has to have and so
if you think, do you

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.361
want an idea meritocracy, you
have to think about those three

00:13:39.361 --> 00:13:39.860
things.

00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:45.220
So this is the thing.

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:48.100
Meaningful relationships
and meaningful work,

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:52.720
together, have produced
this success, and then

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.820
this radical truthfulness
and radical transparency

00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:58.330
you know produces
an idea meritocracy.

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:01.090
That's it.

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:06.460
The other thing is, in order
to have an idea meritocracy

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:10.790
and in order to have great
personal development--

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:11.540
here.

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:13.940
When you know what
someone is like,

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:15.950
you know what you
can expect from them.

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:21.110
Can you talk about
what people are like?

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:24.830
Can you deal with really
getting at what people are like?

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:26.630
Do you know what
you're are like?

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:28.520
Or are you going to
hide those things

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:31.820
and not talk about those things?

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:34.250
People who want to come
into this environment

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:37.340
would like to honestly know what
their strengths and weaknesses

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:40.520
are and work on those so that
they can produce better teams,

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:42.410
that people who
have some weaknesses

00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:46.190
can work with people who
have corresponding strengths

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:49.130
and also know about
themselves and also

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:51.770
be very straightforward,
that I can hand you

00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:54.950
that responsibility,
but I can't hand you

00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:56.840
this responsibility
because you appear

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:58.790
to have these weaknesses.

00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:01.400
How do you get objectively
at the question

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:04.670
of whether you have those
weaknesses or those strengths?

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:06.920
Can we have do that objectively?

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:08.730
That is really great.

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:12.690
So this is an important element
that has been fantastic for us.

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:13.940
And I'll give you a sense.

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:17.860
So this is just making
the point that in a job,

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:20.600
quality is needed, then
what somebody's like,

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:24.390
and the goal is
to eliminate that.

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:27.200
So now I use technology
and algorithms.

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:30.410
I started 25 years ago--

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:35.810
and we do have done it to
a great, enormous degree--

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:38.660
use algorithms to take
principles and put them

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:40.520
into making
decision-making systems.

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:42.770
All of our investment
decision-making

00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:46.550
is made by replicating
our thinking

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:49.460
and actually putting them in
algorithms and taking in data.

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:51.650
And we do the same
thing for about half

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:54.140
of our management processes.

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:56.720
And I do believe that
we're on the path

00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:00.020
that we will have
algorithmic, idea meritocratic

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:03.590
decision-making done
by algorithms that

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:06.110
can see everything and
that can make better

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:08.870
decisions than individuals
stuck in their heads

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:10.790
and because you can
specify the algorithm,

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:12.260
so everybody can
see the algorithm,

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:13.980
so everybody can
see the criteria.

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:16.460
And they can evaluate the
merit of the criteria.

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:18.620
But to just give
you a little sense

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:21.980
of that, what I
want to do is just

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:24.740
show you a little clip
of one of the tools

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:27.740
that we use and it'll give you
a flavor of what we're doing.

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:28.934
So who can hit the clip?

00:16:28.934 --> 00:16:29.600
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:33.470
- In order to give you a glimmer
into what this looks like, I'd

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:36.560
like to take you into a
meeting and introduce you

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:38.840
to a tool of ours,
called the dot collector,

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:40.010
that helps us do this.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.240
A week after the US
election, our research team

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:50.150
held a meeting to discuss
what a Trump presidency would

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:52.310
mean for the US economy.

00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:55.160
Naturally, people had different
opinions on the matter

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:58.190
and how we were
approaching the discussion.

00:16:58.190 --> 00:17:00.980
The dot collector
collects these views.

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:03.230
It has a list of a
few dozen attributes.

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:05.210
So whenever somebody
thinks something

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:08.300
about another person's
thinking, it's easy for them

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:10.280
to convey their assessment.

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:13.220
They simply note the
attribute and provide a rating

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:15.839
from 1 to 10.

00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:18.180
For example, as
the meeting began,

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:22.010
a researcher named
Jen rated me a 3--

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:25.440
in other words, badly--

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:28.620
for not showing a good
balance of open-mindedness

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:30.390
and assertiveness.

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:33.720
As the meeting transpired,
Jen's assessments of people

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:36.240
added up like this.

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:38.460
Others in the room have
different opinions.

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:39.660
That's normal.

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:41.070
Different people
are always going

00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:43.140
to have different opinions.

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:45.560
And who knows who's right?

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:49.940
Let's look at just what people
thought about how I was doing.

00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:52.160
Some people thought I did well.

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.400
Others, poorly.

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.950
With each of these views,
we can explore the thinking

00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:58.850
behind the numbers.

00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:02.100
Here's what Jen and Larry said.

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:04.620
Note that everyone gets
to express their thinking,

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:06.960
including their critical
thinking, regardless

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:09.530
of their position
in the company.

00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:12.510
Jen, who's 24 years old
and right out of college,

00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:16.730
can tell me, the CEO, that I'm
approaching things terribly.

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:20.600
This tool helps people
both express their opinions

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.750
and then separate themselves
from their opinions

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:26.970
to see things from
a higher level.

00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:29.550
When Jen and others
shift their attentions

00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:32.820
from inputting their own
opinions to looking down

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:36.990
on the whole screen,
their perspective changes.

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:40.170
They see their own opinions
as just one of many

00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:42.870
and naturally start
asking themselves, how

00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:45.750
do I know my opinion is right?

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:48.030
That shift in
perspective is like going

00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:52.170
from seeing in one dimension to
seeing in multiple dimensions,

00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:56.280
and it shifts the conversation
from arguing over our opinions

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:59.190
to figuring out objective
criteria for determining

00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:01.230
which opinions are best.

00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:05.460
Behind the dot collector is
a computer that is watching.

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:07.440
It watches what all these
people are thinking,

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:10.260
and it correlates that
with how they think.

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:14.750
And it communicates advice back
to each of them based on that.

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:18.290
Then it draws the data
from all the meetings

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:21.530
to create a pointillist
painting of what people are like

00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:23.480
and how they think.

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:27.120
And it does that
guided by algorithms.

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:29.730
Knowing what people are like
helps to match them better

00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:31.380
with their jobs.

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:34.110
For example, a creative
thinker who is unreliable

00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:35.760
might be matched up
with someone who's

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:38.640
reliable but not creative.

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:40.710
Knowing what people
are like also

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:44.250
allows us to decide what
responsibilities to give them

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:48.360
and to weigh our decisions
based on people's merits.

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:50.880
We call it their believability.

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.560
Here's an example
of a vote that we

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:57.360
took where the majority
of people felt one way.

00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:00.170
But when we weighed the views
based on people's merits,

00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:03.250
the answer was
completely different.

00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:05.740
This process allows
us to make decisions

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:09.970
not based on democracy,
not based on autocracy,

00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:13.930
but based on algorithms that
take people's believability

00:20:13.930 --> 00:20:17.740
into consideration.

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:19.720
Yeah, we really do this.

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:20.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:23.040
[END PLAYBACK]

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:26.300
RAY DALIO: And so that you
can see believability waiting.

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:30.080
So let's imagine that you
have data on everybody

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:33.800
so that you just don't
go walking in a room

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:39.800
and everybody's got an opinion
without actually thinking,

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:42.212
with some element
of score, who is

00:20:42.212 --> 00:20:44.420
more likely to have a better
opinion, because there's

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:45.680
a certain dynamic.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:47.840
You put 10 people in
a room, and you're

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:51.470
going to get one of two things.

00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:54.690
You're going to either have
autocratic decision making.

00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:58.190
In other words, everybody
feeds their opinions,

00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:01.040
and then the guy who
is responsible for that

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:04.580
then says, OK, here's my
decision based on that.

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:05.870
That's more normal.

00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:07.370
Sometimes you'll
go around the room,

00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:08.661
and, what does everybody think?

00:21:08.661 --> 00:21:10.760
And then there's a
notion to a consensus.

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:14.630
And that's not so good either.

00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:17.060
What I did-- because
I really don't know

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:18.810
that I have the right answer.

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:20.060
I really don't.

00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:24.470
Running the company, the reason
I did this was out of need.

00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:28.896
I want to triangulate
about people who I believe

00:21:28.896 --> 00:21:30.020
might have better thinking.

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:33.385
And if three believable
people believe one thing

00:21:33.385 --> 00:21:35.510
and I believe something
else, there's a good chance

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:37.250
that I might be wrong.

00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:39.130
And also, what am I going to do?

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:40.080
What about for them?

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:44.510
So I like to have these
believability scores that

00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:46.760
is accumulated by data
and other people's

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:49.610
thinking of who is better and
worse or different things.

00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:52.220
And then people can
change those scores

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:54.042
or take those into
consideration.

00:21:54.042 --> 00:21:56.000
And that's what
believability-weighted decision

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.690
making is because it helps
the idea meritocracy.

00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:00.770
OK, so that's what we do.

00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:03.180
We'll go to the
question and answer.

00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:06.710
The important thing here
is to talk about idea

00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:08.580
meritocratic decision making.

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:11.420
However we choose to do
it and whatever tools

00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:15.140
we use to get at
that is, really,

00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:18.530
of subordinate importance
to the idea of,

00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:22.230
how do you have that idea
meritocratic decision making?

00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:24.830
I believe that what
you're going to see

00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:28.640
is, if you start to get to this
principle decision-making idea

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:30.770
meritocratic
decision-making, what you're

00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:36.200
going to see is the learning
of principles for dealing

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:39.350
with situations that themselves
will be idea meritocratic.

00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:41.120
So if you have a
situation, and you're

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:46.280
going to Google to find
out what the facts are now,

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:49.190
you will increasingly
be able to go to Google

00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:51.470
and find out how
you should handle

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:53.990
certain things,
principles and the like,

00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:57.440
in that idea meritocratic way
with believability-weighted

00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:59.340
decision-making and the like.

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:00.920
So I want to throw
that out there,

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:02.732
and then we'll have
our conversation.

00:23:02.732 --> 00:23:04.190
JORDAN THIBODEAU:
I'd like to start

00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:06.920
with-- you had a concept
called the "two yous"

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:09.380
and how that affects
our thinking process

00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:10.790
and also taking feedback.

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:13.040
Can you talk about that?

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:15.110
RAY DALIO: Well,
the brain actually

00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:18.890
has a lot of parts
in it that are

00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:22.530
the things that compete with
each other to make decisions.

00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:27.320
But the two big yous
are the thoughtful you,

00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:30.950
that is in our
conscious mind, and then

00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:34.970
the emotional you, which is
in our subconscious mind.

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:39.680
There are a lot of motivations
that you probably don't even

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:43.430
know, that are subliminal, that
came from maybe early childhood

00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:46.550
or your circumstances that
are below the surface.

00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:47.660
And they're at odds.

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:49.480
They struggle with each other.

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:56.420
So the issue of, would you
like to know your weaknesses?

00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:58.640
Would you like to know
what other people really

00:23:58.640 --> 00:23:59.768
think about you?

00:23:59.768 --> 00:24:00.910
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Yeah.

00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:03.410
RAY DALIO: OK,
intellectually, you

00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:05.510
would like to know those things.

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:09.420
Emotionally, you might not
like to know those things.

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:13.460
And so when you're dealing with
our environment, and you say,

00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:15.320
would you like to
have this environment

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:19.910
of radical truthfulness
and radical transparency,

00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:22.860
almost everybody
intellectually says it,

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:25.520
and when they're going
through it they say it.

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:28.820
And you see them also struggle
with their emotional selves

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:31.790
as they're going through
it until they re-adapt.

00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:34.160
And when they start to
re-adapt, and they say,

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:37.460
knowing what's true is good.

00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:39.930
And yeah, now I
know my weaknesses,

00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:42.200
and I know what other people
are thinking about me.

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:44.390
And I could approach
what to do about it.

00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:47.400
Then they sort of make a
transition to the other side.

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:51.350
So we have our
two yous that lead

00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:58.690
to struggles like disagreement,
disagreement and finding

00:24:58.690 --> 00:25:02.810
it emotionally difficult.
It's curiosity.

00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:04.460
Why shouldn't that be a joy?

00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:08.040
But we have that emotional
thing that we have to struggle.

00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:09.890
So that's the two yous.

00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:11.556
JORDAN THIBODEAU: And
what are some tips

00:25:11.556 --> 00:25:15.604
that people can help themselves
get through the two yous issue

00:25:15.604 --> 00:25:17.270
to make them more
resilient to feedback?

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:18.500
RAY DALIO: Well,
there are a number

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:20.708
of there are a number of
things that are in the book.

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:29.100
Let me answer it before I
go to that particular one.

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:33.540
Whenever there's whenever
there's conflict,

00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:37.716
I recommend that you go to a
higher level, one level up.

00:25:37.716 --> 00:25:39.090
Whenever you have
a disagreement,

00:25:39.090 --> 00:25:42.570
just go to one level
up with the person

00:25:42.570 --> 00:25:46.050
that you're in the conflict
with or even yourselves

00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:47.790
when you have a dilemma.

00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:52.170
And look and come up
with an agreement of how

00:25:52.170 --> 00:25:54.810
you should be with each other.

00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:57.400
In other words, let's say you
and I have a disagreement.

00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:01.600
OK, rather than being caught in
the anger of that disagreement,

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:05.070
to go above and you should
say, how do we disagree?

00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:06.540
How should we disagree?

00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:10.280
Form a contract of how you
should be with each other,

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:13.532
and make that a
practical modus operandi.

00:26:13.532 --> 00:26:14.990
That's what we do,
and then there's

00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:16.850
also then the ways we do it.

00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:19.920
So the ways we do it
are certain things.

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:27.670
First, to know that
decision-making

00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:30.450
is a 2-step process.

00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:35.780
There is first taking in,
and then there's deciding.

00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:40.270
The capacity to take in the
other person's point of view,

00:26:40.270 --> 00:26:44.770
the noticing how your
body is reacting,

00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:46.570
noticing how you are reacting.

00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:49.030
Am I having my heart rate rise?

00:26:49.030 --> 00:26:51.260
Can I pause?

00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:53.910
We have something like
the two-minute rule.

00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:58.230
You say, can I have two minutes?

00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:01.170
Then that person has the two
minutes to say what they want.

00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:05.900
Having those kinds
of protocols--

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:09.920
there are a number
explained in the book.

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:14.460
Where there's curiosity,
where there's not blocking.

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:18.580
Somebody in a
discussion will do a lot

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:21.010
to block the taking it in.

00:27:21.010 --> 00:27:22.890
So these protocols--

00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:24.410
I won't go through them all.

00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:28.270
But having those protocols
in place that you practice

00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:29.870
are fair.

00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:35.610
I have created an app called
a Dispute Resolver, OK?

00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:39.240
So when anybody has a
dispute, you push the button,

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:41.820
and there's a path, and
the dispute's resolved.

00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:44.400
It's explained in the
appendix of the book.

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:46.440
All the tools are there.

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:49.470
And it describes
procedurally what one does,

00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:51.960
depending on the
level of the dispute.

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:55.650
A very common thing is if
you and I have a dispute,

00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:57.960
one of the simplest
things to do is for you

00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:00.695
and I mutually
agree on a mediator.

00:28:04.069 --> 00:28:05.860
So we agree on a mediator
and move forward.

00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:08.570
Some others might be
matters of principle

00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:11.775
and almost progress
like legal cases.

00:28:11.775 --> 00:28:12.650
What's your evidence?

00:28:12.650 --> 00:28:13.150
What's this?

00:28:13.150 --> 00:28:15.357
And who is the judge?

00:28:15.357 --> 00:28:17.440
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Now,
when you have this dialogue

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:19.630
and discussion about
feedback, and it

00:28:19.630 --> 00:28:21.940
might turn into
a tense situation

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:24.780
like with disagreement, are
there mediums of exchange

00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:25.856
that you prioritize?

00:28:25.856 --> 00:28:29.330
Because I see some people
who will go towards email,

00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:33.700
but when you use email, you miss
tone and content and context.

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:35.380
RAY DALIO: As a
generalization, we

00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:38.680
want the person to find
the medium of exchange

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:41.380
that they're most comfortable
with because there

00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:43.540
are pros and cons to each.

00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:45.970
Like, some people,
in the moment,

00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:49.090
feel that they're not as
spontaneous in the moment,

00:28:49.090 --> 00:28:51.130
or they may be more introverted.

00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:54.240
And they think that they won't
present themselves the best

00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:56.950
in a person,
one-on-one discussion

00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:59.920
so that they would prefer
by email to say, listen,

00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:04.270
I'd like to lay out my thoughts,
hear your thoughts by email,

00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:07.180
and then have that opportunity
to have the back-and-forth.

00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:09.179
Some people would like
to do it other ways.

00:29:09.179 --> 00:29:10.720
The important thing
is that they just

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:12.884
agree on what's most
effective for them.

00:29:12.884 --> 00:29:14.050
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Excellent.

00:29:14.050 --> 00:29:18.280
Now, let's say an organization
goes through a calamity

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:22.120
and there's a trust issue
in the organization,

00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:25.980
how does the company
go about rebuilding

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:28.720
the trust within employees?

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:31.900
RAY DALIO: Well, again, I
think radical truthfulness

00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:35.550
and radical transparency
is the means of doing it.

00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:40.410
What I did and what my
experience would be--

00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:44.360
if you have radical
transparency--

00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:50.360
so literally, every crisis I was
in, every situation I was in,

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:54.200
I would have a camera
in that discussion

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:57.410
as we looked at the pros
and cons of the issue

00:29:57.410 --> 00:30:01.130
so everybody could see the pros
and cons of that discussion

00:30:01.130 --> 00:30:03.560
so you know there's no spin.

00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:07.580
You have a trust issue if
it's hidden behind the scenes,

00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:08.480
I think.

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:11.450
With radical transparency,
so everybody could see.

00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:17.000
Just imagine what it would be
like here, OK, for whatever

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.290
issue, that you could see
how people making decisions,

00:30:21.290 --> 00:30:23.450
literally, weighing
the pros and cons

00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:25.550
and seeing how they are real.

00:30:25.550 --> 00:30:28.010
And it could be anything from
the top of the organization

00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:31.430
to just even somebody
firing somebody else.

00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:32.870
Was it done well?

00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:36.620
That radical transparency
and then coming out of it

00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:41.150
and writing principles as to,
why did you handle it that way,

00:30:41.150 --> 00:30:43.460
and then putting
those principles out

00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:45.770
so that everybody could
debate that principle

00:30:45.770 --> 00:30:48.800
or look at that principle, not
in an enormous, time-consuming

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:52.070
way but in an effective
way and then having an idea

00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:54.440
meritocratic way
where you look at that

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:57.050
and you say, OK, that
decision was made that way.

00:30:57.050 --> 00:30:58.970
Maybe that's not the
way I would do it.

00:30:58.970 --> 00:31:02.370
But I now understand
the thinking behind it.

00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:06.080
Because if you don't
have that kind of thing,

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:08.510
then there's alienation.

00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:12.410
If you don't have trust and
you don't have an appreciation,

00:31:12.410 --> 00:31:14.960
then increasingly, you build
an organization in which

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:16.930
there's a "we" and "them."

00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:19.970
There's those people who
are making the decisions,

00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:22.980
and you don't really
understand it.

00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:25.670
And you just have
to go along with it.

00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:30.560
And then that becomes
a source of tension.

00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:33.110
And then there are
factions and all that.

00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:34.910
And there's no resolution.

00:31:34.910 --> 00:31:38.330
You have to have
resolution and get past it.

00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:43.400
So the radical truthfulness
and the radical transparency

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:44.330
brings trust.

00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:46.830
And it means that bad stuff--

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:49.880
it's tough stuff bad stuff
to happen because bad stuff

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:51.501
happens in the dark.

00:31:51.501 --> 00:31:52.750
JORDAN THIBODEAU: That's true.

00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:55.800
RAY DALIO: If you make
it radically transparent

00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:58.320
and anybody can bring it
up, then everybody owns it.

00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:02.130
Radical transparency is
a very effective tool

00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:04.890
in terms of building trust and
putting things to the light.

00:32:04.890 --> 00:32:06.810
Believe me, none
of this is perfect,

00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:10.020
but it's certainly
been miraculous for us.

00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:12.870
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Excellent.

00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:15.030
Why do you think
organizations aren't going

00:32:15.030 --> 00:32:16.520
towards radical transparency?

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:23.830
RAY DALIO: First of all, I
think that they inevitably will.

00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:29.112
You must know that it's so easy
to collect data on everybody.

00:32:29.112 --> 00:32:32.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:35.440
So everybody's going to
know what everybody's like,

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:38.260
and then the question is, who's
got the radical transparency?

00:32:41.456 --> 00:32:42.830
And then what are
you going to do

00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:45.380
with the radical transparency?

00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:49.060
You're going to make what you do
with it radically transparent?

00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:52.960
OK, so I think
evolutionarily, we're

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:56.880
going to go to this
radical truthfulness

00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:58.630
and this radical
transparency because it's

00:32:58.630 --> 00:33:01.120
going to be tough to hide.

00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:07.730
I think it's a control
thing and time thing.

00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:11.090
So it's a control thing means
you're a decision maker,

00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:14.420
and all these people have all
these different points of view.

00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:17.010
And how meritocratic
is it to hear all this?

00:33:17.010 --> 00:33:18.669
And we'll never
resolve those things.

00:33:18.669 --> 00:33:20.210
Somebody just wants
to sort of get on

00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:21.690
with their decision-making.

00:33:21.690 --> 00:33:23.630
And I think that that's
because they're still

00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:30.150
in this, what I believe,
will be an old world mindset,

00:33:30.150 --> 00:33:35.130
that it is all in the head,
rather than out of the head

00:33:35.130 --> 00:33:37.650
and in that notion of
how do you make the best

00:33:37.650 --> 00:33:40.740
algorithmic decision-making
so it's not in the head.

00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:42.780
But we still have
the, it's in my head,

00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:45.950
and I want to do what I want
to do, and I know better.

00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:47.185
And how do I do that?

00:33:47.185 --> 00:33:48.060
That's a big part of.

00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:48.559
It

00:33:48.559 --> 00:33:50.730
And then thinking, of
course, about the time

00:33:50.730 --> 00:33:53.280
of, how do you resolve
it with all these people

00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:56.310
so that you have a real
time-efficient, effective way

00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:58.260
of having an idea meritocracy.

00:33:58.260 --> 00:34:00.000
Those are the barriers.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.640
And then there's this
two you thing, OK?

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:04.930
That emotional you thing.

00:34:04.930 --> 00:34:07.385
Those are the, I would
say, the main barriers.

00:34:07.385 --> 00:34:08.340
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Now,
you said what's important

00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:10.006
for the mission of
Bridgewater is having

00:34:10.006 --> 00:34:12.690
meaningful relationships.

00:34:12.690 --> 00:34:15.210
Have you found that
with this transparency

00:34:15.210 --> 00:34:18.679
you've been able to
supercharge the relationships

00:34:18.679 --> 00:34:22.020
that you've had in the company?

00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:25.989
RAY DALIO: Yeah, yes.

00:34:25.989 --> 00:34:28.880
But we don't even have to
go to the company level.

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:31.389
I'm just saying any
group of individuals

00:34:31.389 --> 00:34:33.610
can decide whether
they're going to be

00:34:33.610 --> 00:34:35.679
radically truthful
and transparent

00:34:35.679 --> 00:34:37.989
and on the same mission.

00:34:37.989 --> 00:34:40.000
If you get five people
together and they

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.800
say we're going to be on that--

00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:43.449
And that's largely
where it started to

00:34:43.449 --> 00:34:45.790
because I start the
company, and I say, how am I

00:34:45.790 --> 00:34:48.820
going to be with each other?

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:52.690
Because that honesty and
being on that mission

00:34:52.690 --> 00:34:54.598
is going to bring
people closer together.

00:34:54.598 --> 00:34:56.389
It almost brings
everybody closer together.

00:34:56.389 --> 00:35:00.400
The hiding stuff and the
absence of trust is bad.

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:02.410
And not only the
absence of trust,

00:35:02.410 --> 00:35:06.700
but you can't have
real ownership if you

00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:10.660
don't understand and
don't have a say.

00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:12.460
Everybody-- and like
I'm saying-- everybody

00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:17.770
has the right and obligation
to make sense of things.

00:35:17.770 --> 00:35:19.300
It's powerful.

00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:21.160
And when you were
in it together,

00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:23.760
something much more
magical happens

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:25.300
than a paycheck and a job.

00:35:27.342 --> 00:35:29.800
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Now, when
you've created your principles,

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:32.060
has there been processes
where you said,

00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:34.240
maybe this principle
worked at this point,

00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:35.890
but now we need
to re-evaluate it?

00:35:35.890 --> 00:35:37.540
RAY DALIO: Constantly.

00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:42.430
Because so I guess I
want to to describe it.

00:35:42.430 --> 00:35:47.740
I just about everything
happens over and over again.

00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:53.860
We instead look at things
as individual things

00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:56.800
that are coming up so it's
like we're in a snowstorm.

00:35:56.800 --> 00:36:01.150
But if you just sort of
say, what species of thing,

00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:04.300
what species of
encounter am I having?

00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:05.880
And you write a
principle for it,

00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:10.780
and you write that, then when
the next one comes along again,

00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:13.750
you see, ah, it's that species.

00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:16.030
And you go to that principle,
and you look at it,

00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:18.680
and everyone's
slightly different.

00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:21.640
And that leads to then the
refinement of the principles

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:23.650
and those differences, right?

00:36:23.650 --> 00:36:26.620
And then to do that
transparently is very powerful.

00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:29.950
So yeah, always.

00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:35.410
And you realize, of course,
that no principle is perfect.

00:36:35.410 --> 00:36:36.560
No principle works.

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:39.850
So those different gradations
get more fleshed out

00:36:39.850 --> 00:36:41.440
and become clear.

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:44.810
And that's what the book
of "Principles" is about.

00:36:44.810 --> 00:36:46.240
It's a bunch of these things.

00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:48.399
But you'll see how
they've sort of evolved

00:36:48.399 --> 00:36:49.940
from this encounter
or that encounter

00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:51.310
or in you get refinement.

00:36:51.310 --> 00:36:54.760
And I would urge you
individually to do this.

00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:58.630
It's one of the most wonderful
things that's happened to me.

00:36:58.630 --> 00:37:01.415
When something comes
along, some situation,

00:37:01.415 --> 00:37:03.290
particularly a painful
situation-- therefore,

00:37:03.290 --> 00:37:07.120
it might signal, you don't
want another one of those--

00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:13.030
after you get past your
pain or at the end of it,

00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:16.990
record your pain and then
think about principles

00:37:16.990 --> 00:37:18.040
and write them down.

00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:21.280
How would you handle
that type of situation?

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:23.470
Write it down like a diary.

00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:26.710
And when you accumulate
those and share those,

00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:28.390
that's very powerful.

00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:38.080
We have an app which we call
a Coach, which somebody says,

00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:40.310
I'm in this situation.

00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:41.540
What should I do?

00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:45.700
And then they go to that Coach,
and the relevant principles

00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:46.730
come up.

00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:48.760
But rather than
just my principles,

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:52.330
I'm going to make it that
each successful person--

00:37:52.330 --> 00:37:55.430
I'm going to get, I
don't know, Larry Page's

00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:58.570
principles, XYZ's principles
for that situation,

00:37:58.570 --> 00:38:00.100
and you have that there.

00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:01.750
And then you have
your own principles,

00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:03.880
and you write it down
so that when you're then

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:06.940
in a situation, you could
look at that situation

00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:10.890
and you say, what should I
do going to those principles?

00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:14.090
Because if you start to think
of that in the principled way,

00:38:14.090 --> 00:38:16.995
it's very helpful,
and they will refine.

00:38:16.995 --> 00:38:20.285
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Now,
in the five-step process,

00:38:20.285 --> 00:38:22.810
of the five steps,
what do people

00:38:22.810 --> 00:38:24.645
have the most trouble with?

00:38:24.645 --> 00:38:26.020
RAY DALIO: It's
very interesting.

00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:30.370
It really depends on
how their brains work.

00:38:30.370 --> 00:38:34.630
Like, there are some real
big picture thinkers who

00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:38.050
have no problems with goals.

00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:41.410
They know where they want to
go, but they have problems

00:38:41.410 --> 00:38:44.730
pushing through to results.

00:38:44.730 --> 00:38:49.400
So there are some people, in
terms of diagnosing things

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:51.050
to the root cause--

00:38:51.050 --> 00:38:52.100
it's a challenge.

00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:55.790
Everybody has a problem
but one of those steps.

00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:59.870
And we see that by
observing themselves

00:38:59.870 --> 00:39:02.540
as to which step they
have a problem with,

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:06.090
they begin to understand
how their brain works.

00:39:06.090 --> 00:39:09.830
It's not a problem, though,
if they work collectively

00:39:09.830 --> 00:39:11.450
because whatever
step they're having

00:39:11.450 --> 00:39:15.470
a problem with, another person,
if they help them with that,

00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:18.140
can really help them be
effective at that step.

00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:21.170
And that's really the
key to success in life.

00:39:21.170 --> 00:39:22.970
The key to success
in life, really,

00:39:22.970 --> 00:39:25.820
is largely knowing
what you're not good at

00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:29.930
and who can help you
be good at those things

00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:32.454
so that you can lean on
each other and be effective.

00:39:32.454 --> 00:39:33.620
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Excellent.

00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:35.600
In the book, you mentioned
Joseph Campbell's

00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:37.070
"Hero's Journey."

00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:39.890
And what type of
impact did his work

00:39:39.890 --> 00:39:41.880
have on you with
your philosophy?

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:47.480
RAY DALIO: Well, my son
gave it to me in 2014,

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:49.020
way late in my journey.

00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:54.380
But I was at a particular point
in my journey where I was--

00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:59.570
he gave it to me at the late
stage, the stage are now at.

00:39:59.570 --> 00:40:02.990
He described returning the boon.

00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:11.120
And returning the moon is the
stage where you learned a lot.

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:15.230
And some people learn a lot,
and then they go to retirement.

00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:19.120
And he was making the point
that when you learn a lot,

00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:23.010
you pass along that to others.

00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:25.670
And he described
it very vividly.

00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:30.200
Like, I don't like
public attention.

00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:33.170
I don't like all of that.

00:40:33.170 --> 00:40:37.730
But he described it
as at that stage,

00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:40.485
how important it is to pass
along what you learned,

00:40:40.485 --> 00:40:43.100
and he described it as
a difficult process.

00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:45.980
And then when you do
that so that others are

00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:50.300
successful without you,
then you get to a stage

00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:52.940
where you're free to live
and free to die because you

00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:55.010
don't have that obligation.

00:40:55.010 --> 00:40:57.050
So that's where he caught me.

00:40:57.050 --> 00:40:59.480
But if you read the book,
it's very interesting.

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:02.960
Or in my book, I
recounted in a few pages

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:05.660
what the "Hero's Journey" is.

00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:09.480
And you start to think about,
where am I on this path?

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:13.160
"The Hero's Journey"-- you
probably don't know the book.

00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:14.744
"Hero of 1,000
Faces" is the book--

00:41:14.744 --> 00:41:15.410
Joseph Campbell.

00:41:15.410 --> 00:41:19.430
What he did is he went through
history and myths and so on,

00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:22.310
and he says there's a
certain type of person who

00:41:22.310 --> 00:41:26.180
has a taste for adventure
and goes through that

00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:30.020
and then has their battles, and
they have the wins and losses.

00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:34.160
And then the mission
becomes important.

00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:37.100
And others become more
important than themselves.

00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:38.030
And they rise.

00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:40.470
We can call that spirituality,
whatever that is.

00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:44.360
But it is the basis
of "Star Wars."

00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:48.480
His book was.

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:51.320
So it's that notion
of that journey.

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:53.090
And it's a good book.

00:41:53.090 --> 00:41:56.240
In my case, I happened to read
it at that particular spot.

00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:58.160
But anybody referring
to it probably

00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:00.920
would find, oh, that's me there.

00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:04.360
One of the biggest
things was the abyss.

00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:05.480
What is your abyss?

00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:07.460
There will come a
time that you are

00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:09.770
going to have a
terrible situation,

00:42:09.770 --> 00:42:11.710
and you're going to--

00:42:11.710 --> 00:42:13.430
miserable.

00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:19.150
And how you reflect
on that situation

00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:22.380
and whether you have
a metamorphosis,

00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:24.480
a change, a personal change--

00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:29.190
me, in my case,
happened in 1982.

00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:36.100
I was publicly dead
wrong in the markets.

00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:40.530
I don't know if I'd take the
time to tell you the story.

00:42:40.530 --> 00:42:42.649
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:42.649 --> 00:42:44.190
JORDAN THIBODEAU:
You have the floor.

00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:49.100
RAY DALIO: Oh, yeah.

00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:53.040
So I formed Bridgewater in 1975.

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:55.580
And I had a small company.

00:42:55.580 --> 00:42:56.250
And I analyzed.

00:42:56.250 --> 00:43:02.220
And I had done calculations
that American banks had

00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:06.120
lent to emerging countries a lot
more money than those countries

00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:09.030
are going to be
able to pay back.

00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:12.300
And as a result, we were
going to have debt defaults

00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:15.140
and a debt crisis.

00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:17.970
And that was a very, very, very
controversial point of view.

00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:22.890
And it turned out,
in that regard,

00:43:22.890 --> 00:43:27.120
to be right Mexico
defaulted in August, 1982.

00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:31.240
And I thought we were going
to have an economic collapse.

00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:33.360
So I received a
lot of attention.

00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:34.860
I was asked to
testify to Congress

00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:36.490
to explain the situation.

00:43:36.490 --> 00:43:39.420
I went on "Wall Street Week,"
which was a show of the time.

00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:41.340
And I believed
that we were going

00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:43.590
to have this economic collapse.

00:43:43.590 --> 00:43:47.977
That was the exact bottom of
the stock market, exact bottom

00:43:47.977 --> 00:43:48.810
of the stock market.

00:43:48.810 --> 00:43:51.240
I could not have
been more wrong.

00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:54.510
Not only was I more
wrong, I lost money.

00:43:54.510 --> 00:43:55.600
I lost money for me.

00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:57.030
I lost money for my clients.

00:43:57.030 --> 00:44:01.410
I was so broke that I had
to borrow $4,000 from my dad

00:44:01.410 --> 00:44:04.170
to help to take
care of my family.

00:44:04.170 --> 00:44:08.730
It was a very, very
painful, painful mistake.

00:44:08.730 --> 00:44:11.610
But with reflection,
I would say it

00:44:11.610 --> 00:44:14.940
was one of the best things
that happened to me because it

00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:19.070
shifted my mindset from
thinking, I'm right,

00:44:19.070 --> 00:44:22.790
to asking myself, how
do I know I'm right?

00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:25.440
It gave me the
humility that I needed

00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:27.360
to balance with my audacity.

00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:28.590
It changed my approach.

00:44:28.590 --> 00:44:32.250
I had a metamorphosis.

00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:35.610
And each person is going to have
their own particular challenge

00:44:35.610 --> 00:44:36.670
that way.

00:44:36.670 --> 00:44:39.370
And so what I'm saying is
like in Joseph Campbell, that

00:44:39.370 --> 00:44:42.240
abyss-- he describes
that experience as,

00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:44.040
you're in the abyss.

00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:46.260
And then do you have
the metamorphosis?

00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:50.070
And that metamorphosis
is a humility,

00:44:50.070 --> 00:44:52.440
and I'm worried that you
might not get it right,

00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:54.720
and how do you get the
best triangulation.

00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:57.090
That's motivated the
idea meritocracy,

00:44:57.090 --> 00:45:01.440
bringing the best independent
thinkers to work together.

00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:02.770
So that's what that's like.

00:45:02.770 --> 00:45:04.024
So anyway, it's a good book.

00:45:04.024 --> 00:45:05.190
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Excellent.

00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:07.410
Now, we know a lot
about your principles.

00:45:07.410 --> 00:45:10.260
But as far as your
father and your mother,

00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:13.140
what type of principles
did they teach you?

00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:15.230
RAY DALIO: Well, my dad
was a jazz musician.

00:45:15.230 --> 00:45:18.772
And he worked late at night.

00:45:18.772 --> 00:45:23.910
When I think about him, he
was a strong, capable man

00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:26.850
who I didn't see much of because
he was playing a lot at night,

00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:27.850
and he would stay there.

00:45:27.850 --> 00:45:30.690
But in later years,
we got closer.

00:45:30.690 --> 00:45:35.460
And my mom loved me to bits.

00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:39.910
I had memories, lots
of memories, of her.

00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:46.320
So I was very fortunate in that
I had a mother who loved me

00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:51.930
and a dad who had strong
character and creativity.

00:45:51.930 --> 00:45:57.284
I remember him-- in his 80s,
he wouldn't let the snow stand

00:45:57.284 --> 00:45:58.200
in the way of driving.

00:45:58.200 --> 00:45:59.449
He'd get out there and shovel.

00:45:59.449 --> 00:46:03.610
And he went through World War
II and that kind of thing.

00:46:03.610 --> 00:46:05.190
And he was a good man.

00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:08.600
So I had those role models.

00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:10.534
And that's what it was like.

00:46:10.534 --> 00:46:11.700
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Excellent.

00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:14.216
RAY DALIO: And we talked
about this earlier.

00:46:14.216 --> 00:46:15.840
So many people don't
have that benefit.

00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:19.710
So I had all that
wonderful luxury of family,

00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:21.620
and then I could go to a school.

00:46:21.620 --> 00:46:24.990
It was an average public
school, but I could get that.

00:46:24.990 --> 00:46:28.410
A lot of people today
don't have that.

00:46:28.410 --> 00:46:30.375
And I think that's a big issue.

00:46:30.375 --> 00:46:32.375
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Maybe
we can transition there.

00:46:32.375 --> 00:46:35.490
Because we were talking about
the psychological wealth

00:46:35.490 --> 00:46:36.540
of having a good family.

00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:38.862
But then there's an
economic component.

00:46:38.862 --> 00:46:41.070
And you've been talking a
lot about wealth inequality

00:46:41.070 --> 00:46:43.410
and populism, and
I thought maybe

00:46:43.410 --> 00:46:45.970
you could talk a little
bit more about that here.

00:46:45.970 --> 00:46:47.910
RAY DALIO: OK.

00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:50.980
Look this is not
an ideological--

00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:52.500
I just want to be clear on it.

00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:56.700
As I look at this, I look at the
practicality of it and so on.

00:46:56.700 --> 00:46:59.100
And I'm dealing with economics.

00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:04.050
And there's a mechanics that
is, as a result of this,

00:47:04.050 --> 00:47:09.990
leading to two economies.

00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:14.070
So they're hidden in the
economic numbers, the averages.

00:47:14.070 --> 00:47:16.930
If you want to go on
LinkedIn, I wrote two pieces

00:47:16.930 --> 00:47:19.330
that you might find
interesting on LinkedIn.

00:47:19.330 --> 00:47:24.730
I divided the top 40% from
the bottom 60%, the majority

00:47:24.730 --> 00:47:27.370
of people, and I looked
at, what is the economy

00:47:27.370 --> 00:47:29.670
of the majority of people like?

00:47:29.670 --> 00:47:31.810
And if you were to
look at that economy,

00:47:31.810 --> 00:47:33.580
it is a terrible economy.

00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:35.890
It has not grown.

00:47:35.890 --> 00:47:38.530
It's the only population
that has rising death

00:47:38.530 --> 00:47:41.560
rates, from opiates from
suicides, the greatest

00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:43.700
change in incomes.

00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:46.030
It's a bad economy.

00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:49.510
And then there's this
economy on the top.

00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:51.940
And I divided it 60%.

00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:54.650
I could have
divided it 20%, 80%,

00:47:54.650 --> 00:47:57.390
and the picture would be
basically the same, not only

00:47:57.390 --> 00:48:00.870
in terms of
usefulness and so on,

00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:04.040
the death rates
rising all of this.

00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:05.810
So it's a phenomenon.

00:48:05.810 --> 00:48:09.250
And it's coming as a result
of a number of things.

00:48:09.250 --> 00:48:12.190
Technology's a big
influence on that.

00:48:12.190 --> 00:48:14.992
Globalization, in many ways,
is a big influence on that.

00:48:14.992 --> 00:48:15.950
There are other things.

00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:18.310
But anyway, that exists.

00:48:18.310 --> 00:48:27.660
If you have rich and
poor together and living

00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:30.210
next to each other in
the same community,

00:48:30.210 --> 00:48:34.920
and they share a budget where
they have to divide the pie,

00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:37.350
and you have an
economic downturn,

00:48:37.350 --> 00:48:39.270
you're going to have a conflict.

00:48:39.270 --> 00:48:41.520
You're going to have
some form of conflict.

00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:47.834
And so populism is
an extension of that.

00:48:47.834 --> 00:48:49.500
This isn't the first
time this happened.

00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:51.760
Like I say, everything's
another one of those.

00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:54.702
So in the study on populism,
which is also on LinkedIn,

00:48:54.702 --> 00:48:56.160
if you're interested
in reading it,

00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:58.770
I looked at 14
populist cases and what

00:48:58.770 --> 00:49:01.680
is a classic, iconic
populist case like,

00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:02.840
and how do they work?

00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:05.340
And so you can read about those.

00:49:05.340 --> 00:49:07.950
And there was an
iconic way of populism.

00:49:07.950 --> 00:49:12.760
So that dynamic of that
disparity, that problem,

00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:14.910
which I think will be
particularly important

00:49:14.910 --> 00:49:18.000
when we have the next economic
downturn, which I think,

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.874
probably--

00:49:19.874 --> 00:49:22.290
I'm almost certain it will be
before the next presidential

00:49:22.290 --> 00:49:24.720
election, which
means that I think

00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:29.200
there'll be a lot of polarity,
and I think it's a big issue.

00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:31.690
So that's the issue.

00:49:31.690 --> 00:49:35.760
It's both an issue
of equity, and it's

00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:39.630
an issue of practicality that
we have to deal with that.

00:49:39.630 --> 00:49:43.950
I would say it should be a
national initiative, I would

00:49:43.950 --> 00:49:48.510
say, led by the president
or somebody in which you

00:49:48.510 --> 00:49:49.650
take the metrics.

00:49:49.650 --> 00:49:52.500
I give metrics for that
boy part of the population.

00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:54.240
You could look at the metrics.

00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:57.570
And if you have metrics,
is it improving?

00:49:57.570 --> 00:49:59.490
Or is it worsening?

00:49:59.490 --> 00:50:01.120
And what does it look like?

00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:03.810
And then you have initiatives of
how to be able to deal with it.

00:50:03.810 --> 00:50:09.880
I think that
economically, there are

00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:13.630
many things that can be done.

00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:14.890
I live in Connecticut.

00:50:14.890 --> 00:50:20.450
Connecticut has the highest per
capita income in the country.

00:50:20.450 --> 00:50:26.410
But it consists of rich people
next to a lot of poor people,

00:50:26.410 --> 00:50:29.494
and the averages
exist, and she works

00:50:29.494 --> 00:50:30.910
in the school
system with what are

00:50:30.910 --> 00:50:34.975
called disengaged and
disconnected youth.

00:50:34.975 --> 00:50:39.790
A disengaged student is
one who goes to school

00:50:39.790 --> 00:50:42.420
but really doesn't study for
tests, doesn't take the tests,

00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:44.920
fails, is basically
a failing student.

00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:48.210
And a disconnected is one
that doesn't go to school.

00:50:48.210 --> 00:50:49.710
They don't even
know where they are.

00:50:49.710 --> 00:50:51.250
They don't come to school.

00:50:51.250 --> 00:50:54.640
22% of the students
in Connecticut

00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:58.150
are either disengaged
or disconnected.

00:50:58.150 --> 00:51:01.930
And you look at the
reasons for that.

00:51:01.930 --> 00:51:06.050
And you look at the
cost of what that means.

00:51:06.050 --> 00:51:07.720
There are programs--

00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:09.100
I won't get into this a lot.

00:51:09.100 --> 00:51:13.510
But there are programs that
help to keep the kids in schools

00:51:13.510 --> 00:51:17.080
and get them engaged that
are needlessly not in there.

00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:19.630
And yet if they graduate
from high school,

00:51:19.630 --> 00:51:22.330
the incarceration rates change.

00:51:22.330 --> 00:51:24.160
The crime rates change.

00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:29.800
Average cost of incarceration is
between 85 and $125,000 a year.

00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:34.010
So you think of the cost of the
society that is having that.

00:51:34.010 --> 00:51:36.550
Anyway, there are
those kinds of issues

00:51:36.550 --> 00:51:39.760
that I think have to be looked
at, essentially, forthrightly.

00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:41.260
That's got to be
viewed as an issue.

00:51:41.260 --> 00:51:42.343
There's got to be metrics.

00:51:42.343 --> 00:51:45.735
And there's got to be processes
in place for dealing with it.

00:51:45.735 --> 00:51:47.480
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Yeah.

00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:49.765
RAY DALIO: And that's our
biggest economic issue.

00:51:49.765 --> 00:51:51.400
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Right.

00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:53.830
If you had a magic
wand and you could just

00:51:53.830 --> 00:51:56.470
write three pieces
of policy that

00:51:56.470 --> 00:51:59.830
could be passed by our Congress
and approved by the Senate,

00:51:59.830 --> 00:52:02.309
what would they be to
solve this issue that's

00:52:02.309 --> 00:52:03.100
going on right now?

00:52:03.100 --> 00:52:05.100
Or do you believe it
more of a private issue?

00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:05.860
RAY DALIO: Well,
again, I believe

00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:07.360
in idea meritocratic decision.

00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:10.660
I think that the
big issue, like I

00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:14.860
was answering before this other
question, before we started.

00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:18.430
I think the biggest issue
is how we deal with conflict

00:52:18.430 --> 00:52:23.680
and what are the
principles that unite us

00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:27.880
and to bring people together
and that sense of, OK,

00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:30.940
working it through and
working it out in a bit

00:52:30.940 --> 00:52:34.825
less selfish way so that
we do healthy things.

00:52:37.447 --> 00:52:39.280
I would [INAUDIBLE] we
would deal with that.

00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:40.738
The other particular
issue-- like I

00:52:40.738 --> 00:52:46.390
said, I would say there should
be a national commission

00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:49.090
to address, what are the
practical ways of dealing

00:52:49.090 --> 00:52:53.020
with such issues and also
clear metrics so there's owning

00:52:53.020 --> 00:52:54.985
the results of those changes.

00:52:57.715 --> 00:53:00.970
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Yeah,
after the post-war period,

00:53:00.970 --> 00:53:05.020
we had this situation where
the threat of World War II

00:53:05.020 --> 00:53:07.300
united all Americans
towards one cause.

00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:10.480
And after World War II, it led
to a lot of social progress.

00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:13.400
And I thought after
9/11 happened,

00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:15.370
we had a period of time
where we came together,

00:53:15.370 --> 00:53:17.470
but then it just collapsed.

00:53:20.827 --> 00:53:22.160
RAY DALIO: Let me just be clear.

00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:24.576
One of the things that scares
me, if you look at history--

00:53:24.576 --> 00:53:30.260
the history of populism is
really a 1930s phenomenon

00:53:30.260 --> 00:53:36.110
because you'll see in this
piece that the wealth gap became

00:53:36.110 --> 00:53:41.510
just top 1/10 of 1% of
our population's net worth

00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:45.530
is equal to the bottom 90% of
the population's net worth.

00:53:45.530 --> 00:53:50.190
So that polarity-- you
go back to the 1930s,

00:53:50.190 --> 00:53:54.170
after the depression,
1936, 1937, and that

00:53:54.170 --> 00:53:56.345
led to the era of populism.

00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:02.870
There's left and there's
right and there's a conflict.

00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:07.650
And a lot of countries chose
a strong populist leader.

00:54:07.650 --> 00:54:11.930
Strong leaders tend to
be more confrontational,

00:54:11.930 --> 00:54:16.250
tend to be more militaristic,
tend to be more nationalistic.

00:54:16.250 --> 00:54:18.170
And that was that period.

00:54:18.170 --> 00:54:24.440
In that period, interestingly,
four democracies

00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:29.250
became dictatorships, chose to,
to try to bring order to it.

00:54:29.250 --> 00:54:33.230
And one of the common
ways of gathering support

00:54:33.230 --> 00:54:36.530
is to have conflict with
an enemy, a foreign enemy.

00:54:36.530 --> 00:54:39.920
So 9/11 brings people together.

00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:43.010
A common enemy brings
people together along that.

00:54:43.010 --> 00:54:45.530
That's a dangerous dynamic.

00:54:45.530 --> 00:54:47.000
So when we're
dealing with this, I

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:49.460
would say that it's
more like we have

00:54:49.460 --> 00:54:52.820
to start to figure out how to
deal with these common problems

00:54:52.820 --> 00:54:54.824
and try to deal with
them a more together.

00:54:54.824 --> 00:54:56.240
That doesn't mean
not being tough,

00:54:56.240 --> 00:55:00.650
but it means being tough
collectively, I think.

00:55:00.650 --> 00:55:02.890
I'm sorry I interrupted
your question,

00:55:02.890 --> 00:55:06.599
but I just wanted to emphasize
that particular dynamic.

00:55:06.599 --> 00:55:07.640
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Thanks.

00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:09.340
Yeah, I see people
more identifying

00:55:09.340 --> 00:55:11.780
for their political party
or their own identity

00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:14.810
and not as much as, we're
all in this together.

00:55:14.810 --> 00:55:17.485
It seems like we're splintering
here in the country.

00:55:17.485 --> 00:55:19.610
RAY DALIO: It's this whole
idea meritocratic thing.

00:55:19.610 --> 00:55:22.370
Like, everybody throws
out, I think this.

00:55:22.370 --> 00:55:23.690
I think that.

00:55:23.690 --> 00:55:25.530
Who gives a damn what you think?

00:55:25.530 --> 00:55:27.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:27.770 --> 00:55:31.040
Just because thinking
it doesn't make it true.

00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:34.250
Does everybody think because
they think it, it's true?

00:55:34.250 --> 00:55:36.549
How do you resolve and
get at what's true?

00:55:36.549 --> 00:55:38.840
JORDAN THIBODEAU: So it's
about creating that contract,

00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:41.240
where we can actually have the
rules of having a conversation.

00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:43.281
RAY DALIO: Yeah, how do
we figure out what's true

00:55:43.281 --> 00:55:45.760
and what to do about it?

00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:46.970
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Excellent.

00:55:46.970 --> 00:55:50.930
So going to you, you
practice meditation.

00:55:50.930 --> 00:55:55.380
What got you into meditation,
and what has it done for you?

00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:56.736
RAY DALIO: The Beatles in 1969.

00:55:56.736 --> 00:55:59.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:00.878 --> 00:56:02.669
JORDAN THIBODEAU: All
right, next question.

00:56:03.307 --> 00:56:05.390
RAY DALIO: They went to
India, and they meditated.

00:56:05.390 --> 00:56:10.120
And they came back and
sounded interesting.

00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:13.820
And I started meditating in
1960 and it has changed my life.

00:56:13.820 --> 00:56:16.590
I would recommend.

00:56:16.590 --> 00:56:17.882
I do transcendental meditation.

00:56:17.882 --> 00:56:19.298
There are sorts
of different types

00:56:19.298 --> 00:56:20.700
of meditation that [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:20.700 --> 00:56:22.530
It has changed my life.

00:56:22.530 --> 00:56:23.750
It has been so powerful.

00:56:23.750 --> 00:56:25.430
And it's probably
the biggest gift

00:56:25.430 --> 00:56:29.361
that I can give anybody
because it gives you--

00:56:29.361 --> 00:56:30.860
I'll described it,
I guess, briefly.

00:56:33.590 --> 00:56:37.550
It connects your conscious mind
with your subconscious mind

00:56:37.550 --> 00:56:40.910
and gives you an
equanimity and a creativity

00:56:40.910 --> 00:56:43.670
that you ordinarily
wouldn't have.

00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:46.160
And the reason it does
that, mechanistically,

00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:51.922
the way it does it is by having
a mantra, which is a word

00:56:51.922 --> 00:56:52.880
doesn't have a meaning.

00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:55.470
It's a sound.

00:56:55.470 --> 00:56:58.070
A popular one would be "om."

00:56:58.070 --> 00:57:01.340
So you repeat that
with your breath,

00:57:01.340 --> 00:57:03.800
and that means that you
get rid of your thoughts,

00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:06.050
because if you
sit there and say,

00:57:06.050 --> 00:57:08.810
I'm going to try not to
think, you can't do that.

00:57:08.810 --> 00:57:10.610
Thoughts just jump around.

00:57:10.610 --> 00:57:12.650
And so till you get
rid of your thoughts,

00:57:12.650 --> 00:57:13.860
you go to this mantra.

00:57:13.860 --> 00:57:15.800
You repeat it over
and over again.

00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:18.840
And so when you pay
attention to that,

00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:20.750
you can't be thinking
about something.

00:57:20.750 --> 00:57:23.360
And then eventually
the mantra disappears,

00:57:23.360 --> 00:57:25.760
and you're in a
subconscious state.

00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:27.870
And when you're in that
subconscious state,

00:57:27.870 --> 00:57:30.590
you're neither conscious
or unconscious.

00:57:30.590 --> 00:57:33.830
You're in your
subconscious state.

00:57:33.830 --> 00:57:35.660
So it's relaxing,
and it's great,

00:57:35.660 --> 00:57:37.700
and it gives you
that equanimity.

00:57:37.700 --> 00:57:44.645
But it also is where creativity
comes from, because you

00:57:44.645 --> 00:57:45.860
don't muscle creativity.

00:57:45.860 --> 00:57:48.170
You don't say, I'm going
to work and get creative.

00:57:48.170 --> 00:57:49.610
It's more like relaxation.

00:57:49.610 --> 00:57:52.880
You take a hot shower, and
this great idea comes to you.

00:57:52.880 --> 00:57:55.250
So it bubbles up from
your subconscious.

00:57:55.250 --> 00:57:58.730
And so it enhances creativity.

00:57:58.730 --> 00:58:01.880
And also, I would say, one of
the best things that one can do

00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:11.450
is reconcile one's
subconscious emotional self

00:58:11.450 --> 00:58:14.210
with one's intellectual
self, because if you

00:58:14.210 --> 00:58:15.560
can get those things aligned--

00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:17.780
like, if they work
in both ways--

00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:19.830
you're going to make
better decisions.

00:58:19.830 --> 00:58:23.600
So meditation has given me
that kind of equanimity.

00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:27.950
So I look at things, things
I might not want to happen,

00:58:27.950 --> 00:58:32.660
but I can approach
them calmly and better.

00:58:32.660 --> 00:58:34.020
So it's a big deal.

00:58:34.020 --> 00:58:35.326
It's been a big deal for me.

00:58:35.326 --> 00:58:37.700
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Has it helped
you analyze your emotions

00:58:37.700 --> 00:58:38.960
in the heat of an argument?

00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:39.793
RAY DALIO: Oh, yeah.

00:58:39.793 --> 00:58:45.230
It helps you go above
yourself and your situation.

00:58:45.230 --> 00:58:48.290
And you look at,
oh, there's Ray,

00:58:48.290 --> 00:58:51.050
and there's the
circumstances and there

00:58:51.050 --> 00:58:54.140
it is and know this
thing happens this way.

00:58:54.140 --> 00:58:58.220
And OK, so what should be done?

00:58:58.220 --> 00:59:00.650
Because if you're
in it, if you're

00:59:00.650 --> 00:59:03.290
in that blizzard of
things coming at you

00:59:03.290 --> 00:59:07.070
and you don't distinguish
what type of thing

00:59:07.070 --> 00:59:10.730
is it, what principle
at that higher level,

00:59:10.730 --> 00:59:12.290
how should I deal with it--

00:59:12.290 --> 00:59:15.080
you're either going
to be in it, or you're

00:59:15.080 --> 00:59:18.530
going to be above it
more at that principle,

00:59:18.530 --> 00:59:21.095
looking down at it
and me and that level.

00:59:21.095 --> 00:59:24.450
And it's much better to be at
this level and then go in it

00:59:24.450 --> 00:59:25.670
and do.

00:59:25.670 --> 00:59:28.097
So it helps to bring
me into that level.

00:59:28.097 --> 00:59:29.930
JORDAN THIBODEAU: I
find myself in this trap

00:59:29.930 --> 00:59:32.120
where I'll start
meditating, and then I'll

00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:33.850
start feeling much
better and good.

00:59:33.850 --> 00:59:36.141
And then I'll say, oh, I
don't need meditation anymore,

00:59:36.141 --> 00:59:38.360
so I'll stop.

00:59:38.360 --> 00:59:41.300
RAY DALIO: It's been so long
for me that what happens

00:59:41.300 --> 00:59:43.487
is I feel good when I meditate.

00:59:43.487 --> 00:59:44.570
I can feel the difference.

00:59:44.570 --> 00:59:49.100
I can say, I need
to go meditate.

00:59:49.100 --> 00:59:53.120
It's that refreshing--
so it's always good.

00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:54.125
It always feels good.

00:59:54.125 --> 00:59:54.740
JORDAN THIBODEAU:
Yeah, and that's

00:59:54.740 --> 00:59:56.430
been an advantage, too, when
you're in the investments

00:59:56.430 --> 00:59:58.260
markets when there's so
much noise going around you.

00:59:58.260 --> 01:00:00.470
Does it allow you to just
focus on what's important?

01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:02.540
RAY DALIO: Yeah, or life--

01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:05.120
family, circumstances,
whatever it is.

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:07.340
We all have those things.

01:00:07.340 --> 01:00:10.131
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Now,
since the book has come out,

01:00:10.131 --> 01:00:12.130
what have your thoughts
been about the reactions

01:00:12.130 --> 01:00:12.800
to the book?

01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:17.990
Did you expect the reactions to
go the way they currently are?

01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:25.470
RAY DALIO: Well, when
in 2010, I started

01:00:25.470 --> 01:00:30.540
to get unwanted
publicity attention.

01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:37.010
And so I put out what our
internal principles were.

01:00:37.010 --> 01:00:38.910
And it was just PDF
file, and it was

01:00:38.910 --> 01:00:40.830
downloaded 3 and
1/2 million times,

01:00:40.830 --> 01:00:42.210
and I got a lot of, thank yous.

01:00:42.210 --> 01:00:44.640
I just put it out so
it would be understood.

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:47.880
And that prompted me
to leave the book.

01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:50.790
I'm, as I say, at
my inclination to be

01:00:50.790 --> 01:00:52.740
much more of a private person.

01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:57.510
I put out this book, and I then
decided to go on social media

01:00:57.510 --> 01:01:00.570
to try to explain and
interact with that.

01:01:00.570 --> 01:01:03.000
And I've found it to
be just wonderful.

01:01:07.845 --> 01:01:11.740
I'm finding it's
having a big impact.

01:01:11.740 --> 01:01:14.880
People are giving me thanks.

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:17.960
They're asking
questions about it.

01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:21.720
It's having my desired impact
of passing along when I wanted.

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:24.210
And I'm actually really
enjoying the interactions

01:01:24.210 --> 01:01:28.860
on social media, because it
has a certain personal list,

01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:30.360
even though it's impersonal.

01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:34.980
So it's good.

01:01:34.980 --> 01:01:36.014
I feel good about it.

01:01:36.014 --> 01:01:37.180
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Excellent.

01:01:37.180 --> 01:01:39.026
Now, the apps you
mentioned in the book.

01:01:39.026 --> 01:01:40.650
When are you planning
to release those?

01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:47.150
RAY DALIO: Six or nine months
or something like that.

01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:48.690
When they're all ready.

01:01:48.690 --> 01:01:51.124
I'd like to make them
available for everybody.

01:01:51.124 --> 01:01:53.790
JORDAN THIBODEAU: So we're going
to take audience questions now.

01:01:53.790 --> 01:01:56.810
So if you have a
question, please

01:01:56.810 --> 01:01:59.216
go ahead and jump on the mic.

01:01:59.216 --> 01:02:00.840
AUDIENCE: Thank you
so much for coming.

01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:05.360
I really enjoyed your commentary
about the secret of life

01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:07.220
and finding your blind spots.

01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:10.310
And when you talk about that,
it reminds me of our own Project

01:02:10.310 --> 01:02:13.250
Oxygen, and we talk a lot
about a lot of same principles

01:02:13.250 --> 01:02:15.756
you have in terms
of making decisions.

01:02:15.756 --> 01:02:16.880
So how do you address that?

01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:19.380
I think one way that we address
it is through diversity.

01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:20.990
RAY DALIO: I'm
sorry, address what?

01:02:20.990 --> 01:02:23.060
AUDIENCE: Finding
your blind spots

01:02:23.060 --> 01:02:27.590
versus using consensus as a
way to measure believability

01:02:27.590 --> 01:02:28.680
and correctness.

01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:33.470
So how do you balance
those two things,

01:02:33.470 --> 01:02:35.210
like having everyone
having a consensus

01:02:35.210 --> 01:02:37.490
about an idea versus
making sure you

01:02:37.490 --> 01:02:41.790
have a truly comprehensive
range of opinions?

01:02:41.790 --> 01:02:43.990
RAY DALIO: OK.

01:02:43.990 --> 01:02:48.110
What you want is the smartest
people most demonstrated

01:02:48.110 --> 01:02:51.890
believable people who will
then disagree with each other

01:02:51.890 --> 01:02:55.880
and disagree with you about
what the best path is.

01:02:55.880 --> 01:03:01.400
Don't confuse
consensus as everybody.

01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:04.640
Don't make the mistake of
thinking that a lot of people

01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:07.130
have valuable opinions
when they may not.

01:03:07.130 --> 01:03:10.620
So you want to try to get to
what is the most valuable ones,

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:12.390
and you want to try
to identify that.

01:03:12.390 --> 01:03:14.210
So just like if you
we're going to-- you

01:03:14.210 --> 01:03:16.050
have a medical problem,
and you think, OK,

01:03:16.050 --> 01:03:19.360
what should I do about
my medical problem?

01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:21.350
You don't want to ask
you're just your friends.

01:03:21.350 --> 01:03:23.808
You want to find out who are
the most believable people who

01:03:23.808 --> 01:03:26.940
will disagree with
you and each other.

01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:31.230
So I gave the health case
in the book about, OK,

01:03:31.230 --> 01:03:32.150
you find this doctor.

01:03:32.150 --> 01:03:35.370
You find that doctor
and then who argue.

01:03:35.370 --> 01:03:37.370
But one of the
greatest ways of going

01:03:37.370 --> 01:03:39.440
through this type
of triangulation

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:41.840
is if you get really
capable people who

01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:43.520
will argue with
each other, if you

01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:46.236
have the triangulation
about what to do,

01:03:46.236 --> 01:03:48.110
that'll probably give
you a good indication--

01:03:48.110 --> 01:03:50.070
OK, well, that might be
the right thing to do.

01:03:50.070 --> 01:03:51.200
And you'll learn.

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:53.720
And when you don't
have triangulation,

01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:57.620
that's where the
interesting learning really

01:03:57.620 --> 01:04:00.650
becomes because, if you hear
two sides of an argument

01:04:00.650 --> 01:04:03.350
and you hear that
debate and then

01:04:03.350 --> 01:04:06.279
ask your own questions and
so on, you begin to probe,

01:04:06.279 --> 01:04:08.570
and you've gained a richer
understanding of the subject

01:04:08.570 --> 01:04:10.460
matter than you ever
could have, and then

01:04:10.460 --> 01:04:14.240
you can come to that
level and get that.

01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:18.330
So I'm not arguing
consensus decision-making.

01:04:18.330 --> 01:04:20.570
I'm arguing
believability-weighted

01:04:20.570 --> 01:04:21.680
decision-making.

01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:24.260
Believability-weighted
decision-making means

01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:27.080
finding out, in
various objective ways,

01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:30.530
in a particular community,
who would be more reliable

01:04:30.530 --> 01:04:32.840
and not and then go
all into the room

01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:34.520
and have the
believability-weighted

01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:36.980
decision-making made.

01:04:36.980 --> 01:04:40.040
That is a most
effective approach.

01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:42.500
I don't know if I've
answered your question.

01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:44.840
AUDIENCE: I guess it's hard,
because subjectivity is--

01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:47.210
and I think especially in
this era of social pressures.

01:04:47.210 --> 01:04:49.220
And I actually think
there's three yous.

01:04:49.220 --> 01:04:50.120
There's our you.

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:52.400
And then there's
the intellectual you

01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:56.030
and then there's the pressures
of, who should we be?

01:04:56.030 --> 01:04:59.300
And I guess it's hard, when
you have something subjective,

01:04:59.300 --> 01:05:01.952
how do you know that it's
something that's-- this is

01:05:01.952 --> 01:05:02.660
getting abstract.

01:05:02.660 --> 01:05:04.618
RAY DALIO: Well, the
first thing you have to do

01:05:04.618 --> 01:05:08.420
here is say, do you
want to find that out?

01:05:08.420 --> 01:05:11.270
How are you going to create
your idea meritocratic

01:05:11.270 --> 01:05:12.050
decision-making?

01:05:12.050 --> 01:05:13.700
Will you not compromise it?

01:05:13.700 --> 01:05:17.870
Because if you are convinced
that you must operate this way,

01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:21.710
you will find the solutions.

01:05:21.710 --> 01:05:24.530
Almost everybody is not
really on that path.

01:05:24.530 --> 01:05:27.080
You just tell me it's hard.

01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:30.260
In the book, I'm giving
you structure of literally

01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:31.850
the things that we're doing.

01:05:31.850 --> 01:05:34.340
There's a lot that you
can go and just follow

01:05:34.340 --> 01:05:37.430
that, because you said,
I can't compromise that.

01:05:37.430 --> 01:05:39.230
But as long as you're
going to keep saying,

01:05:39.230 --> 01:05:42.170
people say it's going
to be hard to have idea

01:05:42.170 --> 01:05:45.170
meritocratic decision-making
and have thoughtful disagreement

01:05:45.170 --> 01:05:48.020
and do these things,
believability-weighted

01:05:48.020 --> 01:05:50.020
decision-making,
you won't have it,

01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:52.880
and you'll be losing the
competitive advantages.

01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:55.620
So in your gut, do
you really need it?

01:05:55.620 --> 01:05:57.595
Do you really want it?

01:05:57.595 --> 01:06:00.160
That's the most important
question to answer.

01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:01.660
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
think that's good.

01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:05.390
I think it sounds like you
base that value of wanting

01:06:05.390 --> 01:06:07.070
that truth and
that's how you come

01:06:07.070 --> 01:06:12.260
to a comfort of this
believability metric

01:06:12.260 --> 01:06:13.702
as dynamic and rigorous.

01:06:13.702 --> 01:06:14.660
RAY DALIO: Find it out.

01:06:14.660 --> 01:06:15.890
Figure it out, and get it.

01:06:15.890 --> 01:06:17.300
Only goal.

01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:19.404
Next person?

01:06:19.404 --> 01:06:20.070
AUDIENCE: Right.

01:06:20.070 --> 01:06:20.945
Thanks for your book.

01:06:20.945 --> 01:06:23.400
I listened to it in
the audiobook version.

01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:25.140
Your voice is very familiar now.

01:06:25.140 --> 01:06:27.750
[LAUGHTER]

01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:29.910
One of the things
about transparency

01:06:29.910 --> 01:06:30.900
that you talk about--

01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:33.570
you argue that it's
great to have it,

01:06:33.570 --> 01:06:35.880
and you give just one
exception that itched me

01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:39.720
when I read it or listened
to it, which was sharing

01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:43.500
the compensation information
from the employees,

01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:46.570
and you gave arguments
why that wouldn't work.

01:06:46.570 --> 01:06:50.070
But I could use the arguments
for transparency against that.

01:06:50.070 --> 01:06:52.490
So I was wondering
how you approach that.

01:06:52.490 --> 01:06:53.700
RAY DALIO: OK.

01:06:53.700 --> 01:06:58.350
First of all, everybody to do
their own, and there's no--

01:07:01.244 --> 01:07:02.160
you can do it one way.

01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:03.326
You can do it the other way.

01:07:03.326 --> 01:07:05.230
And who knows exactly
which way to do it.

01:07:05.230 --> 01:07:07.560
And some times I say
to myself, if you

01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:10.950
wrestle about which way to do it
so much and you struggle at it,

01:07:10.950 --> 01:07:12.480
you probably could
just flip a coin

01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:15.330
and decide, because they're
probably about equally good.

01:07:15.330 --> 01:07:17.850
So the question at hand
that's being referred

01:07:17.850 --> 01:07:21.060
is, do I make everybody's
individual compensation

01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:22.140
transparent?

01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:28.290
And the reason I chose
not to do that is I

01:07:28.290 --> 01:07:33.450
instead make very clear
metrics and compensation levels

01:07:33.450 --> 01:07:38.220
by groups of people rather than
putting the particular names

01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:40.560
to that so that
everybody knows if you're

01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:42.840
doing this well with
that generalization,

01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:45.270
you know where the comp
levels are for others.

01:07:45.270 --> 01:07:48.420
And the reason I did that is
because when I found myself

01:07:48.420 --> 01:07:51.840
in discussions with,
is an evaluation

01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:56.140
of how that guy is
doing with other people.

01:07:56.140 --> 01:07:57.310
And that wasn't good.

01:07:57.310 --> 01:08:00.930
In other words, if all
of a sudden you say,

01:08:00.930 --> 01:08:03.840
Harry's earning this amount.

01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:07.147
And now I have to describe
my relationship and how

01:08:07.147 --> 01:08:08.730
I'm evaluating Harry,
and you're going

01:08:08.730 --> 01:08:11.640
to now have to be the judge
of how I'm evaluating Harry

01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:12.940
and all that type of stuff.

01:08:12.940 --> 01:08:16.710
And that's not what you're
going to be able to be good at.

01:08:16.710 --> 01:08:20.220
Nor should we do that, just
in terms of compensation.

01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:22.350
So I'm radically transparent.

01:08:22.350 --> 01:08:25.050
The message and the
conversation I want to have

01:08:25.050 --> 01:08:28.830
here is, do you want to
be radically transparent?

01:08:28.830 --> 01:08:31.290
I want to make sure we
don't get into one of those,

01:08:31.290 --> 01:08:33.430
exactly how radically
transparent,

01:08:33.430 --> 01:08:35.430
because I don't really
care too much about that.

01:08:35.430 --> 01:08:37.229
Do it either way is OK, fine.

01:08:37.229 --> 01:08:39.870
But how are you doing
on the general concepts

01:08:39.870 --> 01:08:41.340
that I'm talking about?

01:08:41.340 --> 01:08:42.960
OK, what about the taping?

01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:47.051
What about the those kinds of
idea meritocratic, those bigger

01:08:47.051 --> 01:08:47.550
issues?

01:08:47.550 --> 01:08:49.680
Because just like the
question before, OK,

01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:51.930
how do we do it,
OK, the big things

01:08:51.930 --> 01:08:53.760
you can we can
wrestle around here

01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:55.490
and how you choose
that individual thing.

01:08:55.490 --> 01:08:57.319
I'm just describing
how I chose it and why.

01:09:00.854 --> 01:09:02.979
AUDIENCE: Hi, I just wanted
to get your perspective

01:09:02.979 --> 01:09:06.160
on how you see your
organizational principles being

01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:09.250
adopted more widely in more
different organizations.

01:09:09.250 --> 01:09:11.890
In particular, I think you had
the relative luxury, I would

01:09:11.890 --> 01:09:15.130
say, of being able to being
the head of your organization

01:09:15.130 --> 01:09:17.410
and being able to
design your organization

01:09:17.410 --> 01:09:21.370
to operate according to those
principles and effectively say,

01:09:21.370 --> 01:09:23.260
if you don't like the
way our principles work

01:09:23.260 --> 01:09:25.631
in this organization,
you can get lost.

01:09:25.631 --> 01:09:27.130
Most of us are not
in that position.

01:09:27.130 --> 01:09:29.800
I was wondering, do you
see these principles

01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:33.130
being adopted more widely by
people starting organizations

01:09:33.130 --> 01:09:35.710
that operate according to a
set of principles from day one?

01:09:35.710 --> 01:09:38.229
Or do you have any
advice on how those

01:09:38.229 --> 01:09:40.870
of us at more of the bottom
level of the hierarchy

01:09:40.870 --> 01:09:45.460
can influence things at a
more local work group level?

01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:49.630
RAY DALIO: Very simply, I
think that those people who

01:09:49.630 --> 01:09:53.800
have the ability to
control their organizations

01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:56.500
will consider this
way of operating.

01:09:56.500 --> 01:09:58.690
And as you say,
the entrepreneurs,

01:09:58.690 --> 01:10:01.630
the people who can do that,
will make their choices.

01:10:01.630 --> 01:10:05.110
And I know that I'm
having an effect on that,

01:10:05.110 --> 01:10:07.060
and that's helping,
but that's good.

01:10:07.060 --> 01:10:09.580
And then people
who don't then will

01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:11.740
start to think about
the choices that they

01:10:11.740 --> 01:10:14.170
have as to where they work.

01:10:14.170 --> 01:10:15.910
You can come to some
environment that

01:10:15.910 --> 01:10:19.450
is more idea
meritocratic and one

01:10:19.450 --> 01:10:21.220
that's less idea
meritocratic, and you've

01:10:21.220 --> 01:10:22.690
got a lot of choices.

01:10:22.690 --> 01:10:25.060
And so for the people
running organizations,

01:10:25.060 --> 01:10:27.760
that's also something
that's attractive to being

01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:30.550
able to attract those people.

01:10:30.550 --> 01:10:32.800
You have to know what
your personal values are.

01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:36.137
For me, I could
not work in a place

01:10:36.137 --> 01:10:37.720
in which I didn't
have the opportunity

01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:40.480
to make sense of something.

01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:43.210
Like those young people
that criticize me--

01:10:43.210 --> 01:10:46.150
that is the way it should
be in order to do that.

01:10:46.150 --> 01:10:48.160
And I could not work there.

01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:51.580
For me, it would be
just like eating shit.

01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:52.290
I couldn't do it.

01:10:52.290 --> 01:10:54.130
[LAUGHTER]

01:10:54.130 --> 01:10:55.930
So it's a personal choice.

01:10:55.930 --> 01:10:58.150
If you feel that's
important, you

01:10:58.150 --> 01:11:00.370
will then gravitate
to organizations

01:11:00.370 --> 01:11:03.160
that are more idea
meritocratic, and evolution

01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:05.440
will take its course, both
because of the entrepreneur

01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:07.132
and because the
individual's doing that.

01:11:07.132 --> 01:11:08.590
JORDAN THIBODEAU:
I'm going to take

01:11:08.590 --> 01:11:10.720
an online question real quick.

01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:12.610
Measurement is a big
theme in your book.

01:11:12.610 --> 01:11:14.200
How do you approach
measuring teams

01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:16.840
whose work has only
second order effects--

01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:19.360
for example, product
aesthetics or who

01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:21.110
prevent bad things
from happening so you

01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:23.020
don't have the counterfactuals?

01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:28.060
RAY DALIO: OK, I want
to say that in every one

01:11:28.060 --> 01:11:32.870
of these types of
questions in which there

01:11:32.870 --> 01:11:37.770
is a particular dilemma
or problem to solve,

01:11:37.770 --> 01:11:42.480
it starts off with a
mind or a group of minds

01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:45.330
thinking, how do I
solve that problem?

01:11:48.020 --> 01:11:52.880
And doing that in an
idea meritocratic way

01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:58.250
will give you the best answer
to solving that problem.

01:11:58.250 --> 01:12:01.250
And that is the most
important thing.

01:12:01.250 --> 01:12:04.630
So when I'm asked
that question, I

01:12:04.630 --> 01:12:08.410
might give my particular
answer to the question.

01:12:08.410 --> 01:12:11.500
But if I just gave my particular
answer to the question,

01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:16.630
I wouldn't convey the fact that
you have the power individually

01:12:16.630 --> 01:12:18.930
to do that anyway.

01:12:18.930 --> 01:12:22.505
So we all face that question.

01:12:22.505 --> 01:12:24.630
When you have a group and
you take the second order

01:12:24.630 --> 01:12:30.150
consequences, and how do you
know the decomposition of that?

01:12:30.150 --> 01:12:33.480
OK, well we can take a
little test here of sorts,

01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:35.160
and we can take
each person's ideas

01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:36.780
and say, OK, now we
have to figure out

01:12:36.780 --> 01:12:39.240
the best way to do that.

01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:42.030
And we can then
gather those best ways

01:12:42.030 --> 01:12:47.340
and come up with that best
way, and that is the path.

01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:48.660
That's always the path.

01:12:48.660 --> 01:12:51.450
If you understand that path,
you'll get to the best way

01:12:51.450 --> 01:12:54.660
you can get to, and that's
better than the ways

01:12:54.660 --> 01:12:55.300
that you have.

01:12:55.300 --> 01:12:56.850
And then it becomes clear.

01:12:56.850 --> 01:13:01.650
So then, in our
particular case, there

01:13:01.650 --> 01:13:05.760
is a series of evaluations
that are very clear evaluations

01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:09.150
that people make themselves,
in a believability way, about

01:13:09.150 --> 01:13:10.810
all dimensions of that.

01:13:10.810 --> 01:13:16.274
So sometimes you can
measure results directly.

01:13:16.274 --> 01:13:18.690
In other words, you can measure
somebody's batting average

01:13:18.690 --> 01:13:20.400
or something-- the equivalent.

01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:25.230
And sometimes it
needs a critique.

01:13:25.230 --> 01:13:29.460
If we're asking does somebody
sing better than somebody else,

01:13:29.460 --> 01:13:32.400
there's no quantitative measure
for that type of measure

01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:35.610
to see that, but we could sort
of say they're critiquing.

01:13:35.610 --> 01:13:40.300
So such measures can
happen at all levels.

01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:42.240
And so we do that.

01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:45.399
Whatever the measurements
that we come up with jointly,

01:13:45.399 --> 01:13:47.190
and we think, OK, that's
good measurements,

01:13:47.190 --> 01:13:49.350
we can create metrics about it.

01:13:49.350 --> 01:13:52.985
So qualitative things--

01:13:52.985 --> 01:13:55.260
I give the example, populism.

01:13:55.260 --> 01:13:56.700
Well, how do I measure?

01:13:56.700 --> 01:13:59.320
But populism happens
over and over again.

01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:00.870
It's a qualitative thing.

01:14:00.870 --> 01:14:04.170
But I could start to
create that process.

01:14:04.170 --> 01:14:07.320
I've found that, by and
large, almost anything

01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:12.440
that I can think of I can
express in an algorithm,

01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:13.320
in a rule.

01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:17.610
The real question is, how do
you get to that good rule?

01:14:17.610 --> 01:14:19.780
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Excellent.

01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:22.360
AUDIENCE: Thank you for speaking
with us today, Mr. Dalio.

01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:23.650
My name is Max.

01:14:23.650 --> 01:14:26.080
And as I'm reading through
this book, which I'm thoroughly

01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:28.180
enjoying, one question
I keep coming back

01:14:28.180 --> 01:14:31.180
to is assessing
the right timing.

01:14:31.180 --> 01:14:34.210
So because we don't
operate in a vacuum,

01:14:34.210 --> 01:14:37.570
coming up with the correct
decision is one thing.

01:14:37.570 --> 01:14:40.720
Knowing to be radically
truthful when giving feedback

01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:42.010
is one thing.

01:14:42.010 --> 01:14:46.030
But how do you assess
the timing around giving

01:14:46.030 --> 01:14:47.800
that type of feedback
or coming to those

01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:49.565
or executing those decisions?

01:14:49.565 --> 01:14:50.440
RAY DALIO: You know--

01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:55.430
well, in the chapter
on decision-making

01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:58.360
there's a section
on timing, actually.

01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:01.600
So you might go to
that section on timing.

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:02.845
And you know, by and large--

01:15:06.700 --> 01:15:09.154
I think you're also asking
timing for the feedback.

01:15:09.154 --> 01:15:09.820
AUDIENCE: Right.

01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:12.640
RAY DALIO: If you're asking
timing for the feedback,

01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:15.670
I would say it's
virtually continuous.

01:15:15.670 --> 01:15:17.530
So that dot collector
thing that I

01:15:17.530 --> 01:15:20.440
did that is giving everybody
feedback from everybody

01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:24.040
and causing people to go above
that is happening continuously

01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:26.620
in every moment of the day.

01:15:26.620 --> 01:15:33.520
So people have a 360 review
continuously by a lot of people

01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:35.080
all the time.

01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:38.410
And so then they can step
back and see the patterns.

01:15:38.410 --> 01:15:41.520
They can look at it
daily if they care to.

01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:44.110
And they can step back and
see the bigger picture.

01:15:44.110 --> 01:15:47.710
But it really is very
advantageous by doing

01:15:47.710 --> 01:15:51.946
it continuously because you
can connect it to the specific.

01:15:51.946 --> 01:15:53.570
In other words, a
lot of times somebody

01:15:53.570 --> 01:15:56.300
will give you an evaluation,
and there's a million--

01:15:56.300 --> 01:15:57.480
an annual review.

01:15:57.480 --> 01:16:00.440
Think about an annual review
and how silly that is.

01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:03.472
If I say, OK, now you're
doing these things,

01:16:03.472 --> 01:16:05.180
but you can't connect
it to the specific.

01:16:05.180 --> 01:16:08.180
By being able to connect it
all the time to the specific,

01:16:08.180 --> 01:16:10.992
you could look back at
that and have consultation

01:16:10.992 --> 01:16:12.950
with other people-- say,
I handled it this way.

01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:14.330
What do you think, and what--

01:16:14.330 --> 01:16:16.311
and you can make
that very tangible.

01:16:16.311 --> 01:16:19.470
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:16:19.470 --> 01:16:21.820
AUDIENCE: I have a question
regarding the organization

01:16:21.820 --> 01:16:23.650
group decision.

01:16:23.650 --> 01:16:28.860
You mentioned that you want
disagreements to be discussed.

01:16:28.860 --> 01:16:32.130
I'm wondering if we
spend too much time

01:16:32.130 --> 01:16:36.360
to persuade each other,
[INAUDIBLE] disagreements.

01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:42.170
This may take some time to reach
the consensus in the group,

01:16:42.170 --> 01:16:46.360
and miss the opportunity because
it would take too much time

01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:48.290
on the group consensus.

01:16:48.290 --> 01:16:50.860
RAY DALIO: Well, in
the book there's--

01:16:50.860 --> 01:16:53.420
if left-- right.

01:16:53.420 --> 01:16:55.560
You're talking about a
risk that could exist.

01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:57.450
It's expressed in the
book on how to do that

01:16:57.450 --> 01:16:59.760
so that it doesn't do that.

01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:06.130
And there's a whole
different way.

01:17:06.130 --> 01:17:12.660
But the important thing
here is to explore quickly

01:17:12.660 --> 01:17:15.600
that notion of how you
should make the decision.

01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:18.930
Because I find since everything
happens over and over again

01:17:18.930 --> 01:17:25.200
on a particular case, if you get
down to a very clear way of how

01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:27.660
you make the
decision effectively,

01:17:27.660 --> 01:17:30.270
you'll be able to move past it.

01:17:30.270 --> 01:17:34.770
I find that the inefficiency of
organizations in which people

01:17:34.770 --> 01:17:39.810
argue endlessly and don't
resolve it is a terrible thing.

01:17:39.810 --> 01:17:40.980
But you need the protocols.

01:17:40.980 --> 01:17:42.667
You need the tools.

01:17:42.667 --> 01:17:43.500
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:17:43.500 --> 01:17:44.662
I will read the book.

01:17:44.662 --> 01:17:46.120
JORDAN THIBODEAU:
I'm going to take

01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:48.560
an online question real quick.

01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:50.870
In your book you talk
about making decisions

01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:53.450
as expected value calculations.

01:17:53.450 --> 01:17:56.420
I find estimating payoff a
lot easier than estimating

01:17:56.420 --> 01:17:58.267
probability of success.

01:17:58.267 --> 01:18:00.350
Given that people in general
are bad at estimating

01:18:00.350 --> 01:18:02.480
probabilities, can you
share some techniques

01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:05.787
you've found to work well?

01:18:05.787 --> 01:18:08.120
RAY DALIO: Well, one of the
things that I found valuable

01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:10.790
was if I write my
decision rule out--

01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:14.180
depending on the nature
of the decision rule--

01:18:14.180 --> 01:18:17.360
I can test how it would
have worked in the past

01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:21.550
and get some sense of it.

01:18:21.550 --> 01:18:27.260
Like in my investment
decision rules,

01:18:27.260 --> 01:18:30.170
I say they have to be
timeless and universal.

01:18:30.170 --> 01:18:34.490
So that means I test them
from 1900 to the present.

01:18:34.490 --> 01:18:36.500
I test them in all
different countries.

01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:39.320
And being able to
specify them then

01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:42.560
allows me to get a
sense of distribution

01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:44.840
of those types of probabilities.

01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:47.490
Some things are qualitative
and it's different.

01:18:47.490 --> 01:18:50.390
But I think that
being aware of what

01:18:50.390 --> 01:18:52.670
I was describing
in the book of how

01:18:52.670 --> 01:18:58.370
to think about that
probability helps you.

01:18:58.370 --> 01:19:01.430
Some things-- it's just
the mind has got to do

01:19:01.430 --> 01:19:04.820
and by triangulating
with others.

01:19:04.820 --> 01:19:08.360
I think in my business
I tend to think

01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:10.400
about that probability
of decision-making

01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:12.470
because I also have
one of the benefits

01:19:12.470 --> 01:19:15.590
that I get very clear paybacks.

01:19:15.590 --> 01:19:18.170
I get graded every
day, essentially,

01:19:18.170 --> 01:19:19.200
by the performance.

01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:21.790
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Right.

01:19:21.790 --> 01:19:22.870
AUDIENCE: Hi.

01:19:22.870 --> 01:19:25.420
So having read the
book I definitely

01:19:25.420 --> 01:19:30.490
agree with you that having
principles is a good thing.

01:19:30.490 --> 01:19:32.440
And they help you
spot another one

01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:34.810
of those kind of situations.

01:19:34.810 --> 01:19:39.256
But one thing that I didn't
quite see covered in the book,

01:19:39.256 --> 01:19:40.630
and I'm curious
to hear about, is

01:19:40.630 --> 01:19:42.790
at what point do you
decide that you've

01:19:42.790 --> 01:19:46.840
seen enough of these situations
that they need a principle.

01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:50.169
Because you could have a
principle for every event

01:19:50.169 --> 01:19:50.710
that you see.

01:19:50.710 --> 01:19:52.995
But then you might
be overfitting there.

01:19:52.995 --> 01:19:54.370
On the other hand,
you could wait

01:19:54.370 --> 01:19:57.790
for too many of
these, at which point

01:19:57.790 --> 01:20:00.040
you're probably
overgeneralizing, so--

01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:00.340
RAY DALIO: I think what--

01:20:00.340 --> 01:20:01.840
AUDIENCE: What's
the meta principle?

01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:05.260
RAY DALIO: My experience is
it's just like a big thing comes

01:20:05.260 --> 01:20:09.790
along, and do you start there?

01:20:09.790 --> 01:20:10.330
OK.

01:20:10.330 --> 01:20:12.359
Now do you have that?

01:20:12.359 --> 01:20:13.650
AUDIENCE: So it's the size of--

01:20:13.650 --> 01:20:15.316
RAY DALIO: And then
what-- you know, OK.

01:20:15.316 --> 01:20:17.130
Now, you're doing it.

01:20:17.130 --> 01:20:19.880
And now another big
thing comes along,

01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:22.080
and you have one for that.

01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:27.000
And if you do that then
you'll find out whether you're

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.250
getting to too small stuff.

01:20:29.250 --> 01:20:31.287
But you probably
won't have a problem

01:20:31.287 --> 01:20:33.120
with the too small stuff
because you will be

01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:35.100
struggling with the big stuff.

01:20:35.100 --> 01:20:40.110
So I have-- I don't
know how many principals

01:20:40.110 --> 01:20:42.840
are in the book, actually--
but anyway, a few hundred.

01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:47.290
And the reason was
because I needed each one.

01:20:47.290 --> 01:20:51.330
What you find is when you
encounter something again,

01:20:51.330 --> 01:20:53.460
then you start to--
is it a subprinciple?

01:20:53.460 --> 01:20:54.460
Is it another principle?

01:20:54.460 --> 01:20:55.800
And you get them organized.

01:20:55.800 --> 01:21:03.630
But the way I did it was I
wrote them first on paper.

01:21:03.630 --> 01:21:06.420
But then I started dropping
them in the BlackBerry

01:21:06.420 --> 01:21:07.720
when I was thinking.

01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:09.490
And I would take that--
bits and pieces--

01:21:09.490 --> 01:21:10.909
and I would collect them--

01:21:10.909 --> 01:21:11.700
just your thoughts.

01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:13.740
So just start collecting them.

01:21:13.740 --> 01:21:15.690
Make sure you do it
with the big ones.

01:21:15.690 --> 01:21:18.040
And, yeah, you don't have
to do it with everything.

01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:19.958
AUDIENCE: So the size of event.

01:21:19.958 --> 01:21:22.619
Thank you.

01:21:22.619 --> 01:21:25.160
AUDIENCE: I think the process
of decision-making and conflict

01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:27.576
resolution that you're talking
about makes a lot of sense.

01:21:27.576 --> 01:21:30.230
But I'm wondering if
a precondition for it

01:21:30.230 --> 01:21:35.280
is that the group agrees
on the general goal,

01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:36.600
even if not how to do it.

01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:40.040
And so that works well in
Bridgewater, here at Google.

01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:42.772
But in the public policy
arena I'm not sure

01:21:42.772 --> 01:21:45.230
how that works, because people
represent different interest

01:21:45.230 --> 01:21:47.900
groups, and they fundamentally
have a different objective.

01:21:47.900 --> 01:21:51.410
Do you see any modifications
as required for that case?

01:21:51.410 --> 01:21:53.270
RAY DALIO: I think
in all relationships

01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:55.880
the beginning is
defining how you're

01:21:55.880 --> 01:21:58.670
going to be with each other--

01:21:58.670 --> 01:22:01.220
clear rules.

01:22:01.220 --> 01:22:05.860
So Bridgewater's rules are
different than Google's rules,

01:22:05.860 --> 01:22:08.210
which are different from
the government's rules.

01:22:08.210 --> 01:22:11.320
Then within any
organization, there

01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:13.330
are subgroups that
can decide how

01:22:13.330 --> 01:22:15.640
are we going to behave with
each other in a way that

01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:17.800
doesn't conflict with that.

01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:22.330
So I would suspect that if I was
president of the United States

01:22:22.330 --> 01:22:25.060
I would have an ideal
meritocratic way that

01:22:25.060 --> 01:22:26.800
might be different
than Donald Trump has,

01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:29.200
who might be different
than somebody else has.

01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:32.930
So you, within your
group, can decide, OK,

01:22:32.930 --> 01:22:36.250
do we want to be idea do we
[INAUDIBLE] meritocratic?

01:22:36.250 --> 01:22:38.320
Can we talk about these
things in this way?

01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:43.470
Do we want to be transparent and
make those types of decisions.

01:22:43.470 --> 01:22:46.702
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:22:46.702 --> 01:22:48.580
AUDIENCE: Mr. Dalio,
thanks for sharing.

01:22:48.580 --> 01:22:51.830
My question pertains to the
dot system that you mention.

01:22:51.830 --> 01:22:54.670
So you seem to have calculated
the believable score

01:22:54.670 --> 01:22:57.670
for a person over time,
collecting information

01:22:57.670 --> 01:23:00.160
to help you with
decision-making process.

01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:03.040
Has there been your dot
system been proven wrong

01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:05.320
where you calculate, say,
someone's believable score

01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:08.140
to be very low, when
over time has been shown,

01:23:08.140 --> 01:23:12.250
actually, this person is
very believable in his--

01:23:12.250 --> 01:23:13.210
has that been shown?

01:23:13.210 --> 01:23:15.130
RAY DALIO: Well,
I think the way--

01:23:15.130 --> 01:23:17.470
I think of it more like
the way that you're

01:23:17.470 --> 01:23:19.340
sort of semi-describing it.

01:23:19.340 --> 01:23:23.980
If over time it's
shown to be wrong--

01:23:23.980 --> 01:23:28.270
quote, "wrong,"-- that
must mean that you've

01:23:28.270 --> 01:23:31.390
evolved to the point
where you believe

01:23:31.390 --> 01:23:35.270
that that verdict is reliable.

01:23:35.270 --> 01:23:39.550
So the evolutionary system must
have taken you to that spot.

01:23:39.550 --> 01:23:45.400
The way I look at it is with
sample size and with a lot

01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:49.510
of consensus, or processes
of coming up with those

01:23:49.510 --> 01:23:52.570
algorithms, you have an
evolutionary process--

01:23:52.570 --> 01:23:54.970
more data, more process--

01:23:54.970 --> 01:23:57.820
to get at the definition
of what is true.

01:23:57.820 --> 01:23:59.800
And then it's that
mechanism that's

01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:02.320
always constantly
evaluating, so that there

01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:05.350
are statistical
ways of measuring

01:24:05.350 --> 01:24:08.110
for a group as a whole
how accurate it is.

01:24:08.110 --> 01:24:10.750
You might have something that
might be something as simple

01:24:10.750 --> 01:24:12.710
as, I would have a test.

01:24:12.710 --> 01:24:15.190
Like, I can test
how you know math.

01:24:15.190 --> 01:24:17.020
And that could be an
objective measure.

01:24:17.020 --> 01:24:20.500
In some areas you can't
have that objectivity.

01:24:20.500 --> 01:24:23.080
On some notion of
creativity much [INAUDIBLE]

01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:25.070
you'll have different measures.

01:24:25.070 --> 01:24:30.040
So the point that I'm saying
is that you're constantly

01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:32.020
never good enough.

01:24:32.020 --> 01:24:35.870
And you're constantly
evolving toward better.

01:24:35.870 --> 01:24:38.800
And that is the best way--

01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:41.200
by comparison to other ways--

01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:43.382
which don't do that.

01:24:43.382 --> 01:24:45.215
AUDIENCE: And is there
a plan to open source

01:24:45.215 --> 01:24:48.690
this so that the system
can be shared and used

01:24:48.690 --> 01:24:49.715
by many organizations?

01:24:49.715 --> 01:24:50.340
RAY DALIO: Yes.

01:24:50.340 --> 01:24:51.256
I'm going-- as I say--

01:24:51.256 --> 01:24:55.320
I'm going to put that out
so that it would open source

01:24:55.320 --> 01:24:57.360
so people can write
their own algorithms

01:24:57.360 --> 01:25:00.630
and agree on together what
the best algorithms are

01:25:00.630 --> 01:25:02.490
so we can make that evolution.

01:25:02.490 --> 01:25:04.530
And, as I say, that probably--

01:25:04.530 --> 01:25:07.500
I don't know how many months--
but, maybe a year or something

01:25:07.500 --> 01:25:08.410
down the line.

01:25:08.410 --> 01:25:09.244
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:25:09.244 --> 01:25:10.743
JORDAN THIBODEAU:
Question from me--

01:25:10.743 --> 01:25:13.080
when you're talking about
the evolving process,

01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:15.090
sometimes it can feel
like a shot in the gut

01:25:15.090 --> 01:25:17.240
over and over again.

01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:20.400
What do you do to make yourself
feel like, OK, you know,

01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:23.100
this is critical in my work
product but not critical

01:25:23.100 --> 01:25:25.490
as me as a human-- like are
there some practices you use?

01:25:29.850 --> 01:25:32.160
RAY DALIO: I think it is
critical for you as a human.

01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:36.410
Meaning, I think what you're
like and knowing what--

01:25:36.410 --> 01:25:38.470
and if you can get to
the point where you say,

01:25:38.470 --> 01:25:41.920
I really know what I'm like,
and I can now objectively

01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:44.260
deal with that to
get anything I want.

01:25:47.970 --> 01:25:49.400
That's fabulous power.

01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:54.050
If you're stuck with
it's a tragedy that I'm

01:25:54.050 --> 01:25:57.110
weak at this thing, or I
don't want to know about it,

01:25:57.110 --> 01:26:00.020
you won't get anything you want.

01:26:00.020 --> 01:26:07.490
So I think it's a personal
thing as well as a work thing.

01:26:10.002 --> 01:26:10.710
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

01:26:10.710 --> 01:26:11.793
RAY DALIO: You think that?

01:26:11.793 --> 01:26:14.406
I mean, I've raised my hand--

01:26:14.406 --> 01:26:15.530
ask you to raise your hand.

01:26:15.530 --> 01:26:17.410
Do you think that
that makes sense?

01:26:17.410 --> 01:26:19.030
Yes, or-- yes, if
you raise your hand.

01:26:21.541 --> 01:26:22.040
OK.

01:26:25.741 --> 01:26:27.240
AUDIENCE: Thanks
so much for coming.

01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:28.850
I started reading
the principles--

01:26:28.850 --> 01:26:30.680
PDF-- that was
released, I think,

01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:32.570
a couple of years ago
and happy to see now

01:26:32.570 --> 01:26:33.819
that you've released the book.

01:26:33.819 --> 01:26:36.770
These ideas about radical
transparency in the workplace

01:26:36.770 --> 01:26:39.650
have been, I think, coming
more to the cultural zeitgeist.

01:26:39.650 --> 01:26:41.656
So that's really good.

01:26:41.656 --> 01:26:43.530
Your principles have
made you a lot of money.

01:26:43.530 --> 01:26:45.821
You've had a very successful
career and that's awesome.

01:26:45.821 --> 01:26:48.110
And so my question
is when you think

01:26:48.110 --> 01:26:49.550
about your principle
of how you've

01:26:49.550 --> 01:26:52.160
chosen to spend your time,
since you could have retired

01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:55.640
many years ago, I'm curious
how you've thought about that.

01:26:55.640 --> 01:26:58.520
And in terms of
like, right now, I

01:26:58.520 --> 01:27:00.620
think you're using
your time to promote

01:27:00.620 --> 01:27:03.260
these ideas of principles in
decision-making and radical

01:27:03.260 --> 01:27:04.090
transparency.

01:27:04.090 --> 01:27:05.548
And I think you
know, hopefully, it

01:27:05.548 --> 01:27:08.190
will have a big effect in
companies in the world.

01:27:08.190 --> 01:27:11.210
And so I'm curious why
you've chosen to do it now

01:27:11.210 --> 01:27:12.110
instead of earlier.

01:27:12.110 --> 01:27:14.390
And in general, how
you think about--

01:27:14.390 --> 01:27:16.740
because you haven't needed
to work for a long time--

01:27:16.740 --> 01:27:21.039
and so I'm wondering why you
chose to continue to work,

01:27:21.039 --> 01:27:22.830
and how you think about
spending your time.

01:27:22.830 --> 01:27:23.496
RAY DALIO: Yeah.

01:27:23.496 --> 01:27:26.390
So first of all, I'm not saying
that anything that I'm doing

01:27:26.390 --> 01:27:27.170
is the right--

01:27:27.170 --> 01:27:29.628
in answering your question--
is the right way to do things.

01:27:29.628 --> 01:27:32.810
I'm just saying it
is, for me, the way--

01:27:32.810 --> 01:27:37.500
I'm answering your question
just how I do that.

01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:42.050
I played the market since I
was 12 years old and I love it.

01:27:42.050 --> 01:27:43.970
And I'll play them till I die.

01:27:43.970 --> 01:27:45.230
I like the economics.

01:27:45.230 --> 01:27:46.450
I just-- it's a game.

01:27:46.450 --> 01:27:47.090
I love it.

01:27:47.090 --> 01:27:48.410
OK?

01:27:48.410 --> 01:27:51.740
But I saw a number of
years ago, if you step back

01:27:51.740 --> 01:27:53.990
and you look at yourself
from a higher level,

01:27:53.990 --> 01:27:58.340
and you take where are your age,
where are you in this cycle--

01:27:58.340 --> 01:28:02.230
as I became 60 and
then, and so on,

01:28:02.230 --> 01:28:07.700
I recognized that it's my
responsibility to transition

01:28:07.700 --> 01:28:08.690
well.

01:28:08.690 --> 01:28:12.290
To make your parents, you--

01:28:12.290 --> 01:28:14.270
think about your
parents and you.

01:28:14.270 --> 01:28:16.070
It's the same dynamic, OK?

01:28:16.070 --> 01:28:20.040
How did they transition well so
that you're good without them.

01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:22.230
It becomes almost an
instinctual type of thing.

01:28:22.230 --> 01:28:25.280
And these things come
to you at these things.

01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:28.100
In terms of retirement,
I love my game.

01:28:28.100 --> 01:28:29.660
I love my mission and so on.

01:28:29.660 --> 01:28:32.130
But it becomes that
there is actually

01:28:32.130 --> 01:28:36.830
a great pleasure and a necessity
to have others successful.

01:28:36.830 --> 01:28:37.910
Me-- I've gone in.

01:28:37.910 --> 01:28:38.870
I've fought battles.

01:28:38.870 --> 01:28:39.740
I've won battles.

01:28:39.740 --> 01:28:41.720
I've accumulated it.

01:28:41.720 --> 01:28:43.580
To go in and fight
another battle--

01:28:43.580 --> 01:28:46.760
I could go do that, but that's
not the most exciting necessary

01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:48.030
thing for me to do.

01:28:48.030 --> 01:28:50.180
So the most exciting
necessary thing for me to do

01:28:50.180 --> 01:28:51.900
is to pass those things on.

01:28:51.900 --> 01:28:54.850
And that's what I have to
recognize as my responsibility.

01:28:54.850 --> 01:28:58.280
And just like I described it,
when Joseph Campbell and I read

01:28:58.280 --> 01:28:59.930
this, says it's totally right.

01:28:59.930 --> 01:29:02.000
Peace-- peace for
your parents will

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.850
come when you're good without
them and everything is fine.

01:29:04.850 --> 01:29:05.750
That's true.

01:29:05.750 --> 01:29:08.090
So it becomes an
instinctual type of thing.

01:29:08.090 --> 01:29:10.540
For me, like, retire--

01:29:10.540 --> 01:29:11.561
like, I'm just--

01:29:11.561 --> 01:29:13.310
I never viewed it that
way because I never

01:29:13.310 --> 01:29:14.480
viewed work that way.

01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:16.174
I just want to go have fun.

01:29:16.174 --> 01:29:17.340
I just want to have a blast.

01:29:17.340 --> 01:29:18.140
I'm curious.

01:29:18.140 --> 01:29:19.940
I want to do a lot of things.

01:29:19.940 --> 01:29:22.160
I will be curious and
do a lot of things.

01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:23.930
There's a million things to do.

01:29:23.930 --> 01:29:26.624
I didn't want to also run
my organization anymore.

01:29:26.624 --> 01:29:28.790
I want it to have that
culture and pass it on and be

01:29:28.790 --> 01:29:30.300
successful without me.

01:29:30.300 --> 01:29:33.650
And I was able to transition
to others who will then run it.

01:29:33.650 --> 01:29:35.960
I'm chairman and I'll still
do the investment thing.

01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:37.790
But whatever it is
that excites you out

01:29:37.790 --> 01:29:40.340
of free choice and
no longer obligation.

01:29:40.340 --> 01:29:41.720
I don't want to be obligated.

01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:44.760
Obligated is also a
sense of responsibility.

01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:47.050
So I want to handle my
responsibilities well and then

01:29:47.050 --> 01:29:48.080
be free of them.

01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:49.795
Those are the things
that motivated me.

01:29:49.795 --> 01:29:50.420
AUDIENCE: Cool.

01:29:50.420 --> 01:29:51.110
Thank you so much.

01:29:51.110 --> 01:29:53.276
JORDAN THIBODEAU: I want
to take an online question.

01:29:53.276 --> 01:29:55.800
Ray, how do you address
the tolerance paradox

01:29:55.800 --> 01:29:56.899
in an organization?

01:29:56.899 --> 01:29:58.565
While striving for
radical transparency,

01:29:58.565 --> 01:30:01.130
you may have some people
who will argue views

01:30:01.130 --> 01:30:03.164
that undermine open discussion.

01:30:05.385 --> 01:30:06.760
RAY DALIO: Well,
I'd want to know

01:30:06.760 --> 01:30:09.700
what the views that
undermine open discussion are

01:30:09.700 --> 01:30:15.640
and what the merit is and
find out why would you

01:30:15.640 --> 01:30:18.230
not have that open discussion?

01:30:18.230 --> 01:30:19.240
I don't understand that.

01:30:19.240 --> 01:30:21.280
Maybe is it a time constraint?

01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:23.380
Is it some other thing?

01:30:23.380 --> 01:30:25.020
I'd have to see
what the impediment

01:30:25.020 --> 01:30:26.680
to the open discussion would be.

01:30:30.445 --> 01:30:32.320
AUDIENCE: I'm interested
in reading the book.

01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:35.720
But I'm just curious, what's
your believability score

01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:39.000
at Bridgewater?

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.426
RAY DALIO: Well, I have
the highest believability

01:30:41.426 --> 01:30:42.300
score in the company.

01:30:42.300 --> 01:30:44.280
[LAUGHTER]

01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:47.160
But it depends on what.

01:30:47.160 --> 01:30:50.360
We rate different levels
of believability for what?

01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:54.390
So I'm referring to
the general score, OK?

01:30:54.390 --> 01:30:56.050
That's not determined by me.

01:30:56.050 --> 01:30:58.020
But anyway, it is
determined in other ways

01:30:58.020 --> 01:31:00.490
that would be objective.

01:31:00.490 --> 01:31:02.490
But if I take a
whole bunch of areas,

01:31:02.490 --> 01:31:05.970
I have much worse
believability scores.

01:31:05.970 --> 01:31:08.370
There are many who have
much higher believability

01:31:08.370 --> 01:31:10.080
scores in different areas.

01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:14.001
It has these something like 60
different believability scores.

01:31:14.001 --> 01:31:14.709
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

01:31:17.430 --> 01:31:18.229
AUDIENCE: Hi.

01:31:18.229 --> 01:31:20.270
Thanks for sharing all
the principles that you've

01:31:20.270 --> 01:31:21.436
acquired over your lifetime.

01:31:21.436 --> 01:31:23.570
So thank you for that.

01:31:23.570 --> 01:31:25.309
My question is
slightly off-topic.

01:31:25.309 --> 01:31:27.350
And I don't know if I'll
have another opportunity

01:31:27.350 --> 01:31:29.480
to ask this question
in person, so I'm

01:31:29.480 --> 01:31:31.340
going to ask you anyways.

01:31:31.340 --> 01:31:33.500
I'm a big believer
in value investment.

01:31:33.500 --> 01:31:36.800
And my belief's been kind of
formed by reading of the books

01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:39.890
by Ben Graham and Seth Klarman.

01:31:39.890 --> 01:31:42.260
But only recently I read
the book by David Svenson.

01:31:42.260 --> 01:31:45.830
And he mentions that
the biggest determinant

01:31:45.830 --> 01:31:48.470
in portfolio returns
is not stock picking

01:31:48.470 --> 01:31:50.510
but capital allocation.

01:31:50.510 --> 01:31:51.910
And I want to--

01:31:51.910 --> 01:31:55.227
I'm wondering what's
your views on that?

01:31:55.227 --> 01:31:57.560
RAY DALIO: Well, because I
think what he's referring to,

01:31:57.560 --> 01:32:04.770
that when he distinguishes
stock picking, he's referring

01:32:04.770 --> 01:32:09.750
to, within an asset class, the
individual securities chosen,

01:32:09.750 --> 01:32:13.230
as distinct from the
differences when he says

01:32:13.230 --> 01:32:15.990
capital allocation,
he's referring

01:32:15.990 --> 01:32:19.530
to the different types
of asset classes.

01:32:19.530 --> 01:32:22.290
I presume that that's what
he's referring to in that way,

01:32:22.290 --> 01:32:23.740
and that's correct.

01:32:23.740 --> 01:32:25.380
In other words,
the average stock

01:32:25.380 --> 01:32:29.580
is 60% correlated with
the average other stock,

01:32:29.580 --> 01:32:31.960
so there's a high
correlation of stocks.

01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:34.150
They will go up
and down together.

01:32:34.150 --> 01:32:37.910
And because of that,
you're going to--

01:32:37.910 --> 01:32:43.009
it almost, past a certain point,
doesn't matter how many stocks.

01:32:43.009 --> 01:32:44.550
I cover that, by
the way, in the book

01:32:44.550 --> 01:32:46.540
in terms of the
math of literally

01:32:46.540 --> 01:32:50.500
how if I take anything
that's 60% correlated,

01:32:50.500 --> 01:32:53.940
and I put more than 10
in, the marginal benefits

01:32:53.940 --> 01:32:57.540
of diversification are
virtually nil, so that you're

01:32:57.540 --> 01:33:00.330
going to have the stock
market or something like that.

01:33:00.330 --> 01:33:04.890
And then some alpha is the
deviation relative to that.

01:33:04.890 --> 01:33:08.250
Whereas, if you have
an asset class--

01:33:08.250 --> 01:33:09.870
different asset classes--

01:33:09.870 --> 01:33:12.640
they'll behave very
uncorrelated with that.

01:33:12.640 --> 01:33:16.680
And so portfolio construction
based on capital allocation,

01:33:16.680 --> 01:33:19.320
as he calls it,
is very important

01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:23.430
in terms of saying that's really
the key most important thing,

01:33:23.430 --> 01:33:26.460
because of the nature of the
correlations of those pieces

01:33:26.460 --> 01:33:28.079
to get that balance right.

01:33:28.079 --> 01:33:28.912
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:33:31.050 --> 01:33:32.300
AUDIENCE: Thanks for the book.

01:33:32.300 --> 01:33:32.799
It's great.

01:33:32.799 --> 01:33:36.740
What is Bridgewater's mid-term
two-year economic outlook

01:33:36.740 --> 01:33:37.460
for the US?

01:33:42.220 --> 01:33:45.370
RAY DALIO: I think we're going
to have a lot of stimulation

01:33:45.370 --> 01:33:46.030
into--

01:33:46.030 --> 01:33:48.130
a lot of profit growth,
a lot of stimulation--

01:33:48.130 --> 01:33:50.920
into capacity constraints,
and that that's

01:33:50.920 --> 01:33:53.320
going to raise interest rates.

01:33:53.320 --> 01:33:57.360
And then there's a sensitivity
to those interest rate changes.

01:33:57.360 --> 01:33:59.800
It's going to put the Fed
in a particularly difficult

01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:02.080
position, other central
banks around the world

01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:04.450
in a particularly
difficult decision.

01:34:04.450 --> 01:34:08.770
And I think that probably,
as you get later in the year,

01:34:08.770 --> 01:34:12.160
you're going to start to see the
question of how does interest

01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:17.180
rates or Fed policy affect
the markets as a general thing

01:34:17.180 --> 01:34:20.920
and when that will become
negative when that's a problem.

01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:24.220
Because we're coming into
the end of the cycle,

01:34:24.220 --> 01:34:25.550
late in the cycle.

01:34:25.550 --> 01:34:27.790
There's a cycle and there's
capacity limitations

01:34:27.790 --> 01:34:28.960
and stimulation.

01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:33.490
And as you go late into
the cycle the Fed never--

01:34:33.490 --> 01:34:35.674
central banks never
get it exactly right.

01:34:35.674 --> 01:34:37.090
And that's why we
have recessions.

01:34:37.090 --> 01:34:38.230
We always have recessions.

01:34:38.230 --> 01:34:42.490
You can't get away from
them when that balancing

01:34:42.490 --> 01:34:43.900
act becomes difficult.

01:34:43.900 --> 01:34:46.750
That balancing act will
become increasingly difficult

01:34:46.750 --> 01:34:49.720
at the end of this year and the
beginning part of next year.

01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:53.020
And it will be manifest
probably in market behavior.

01:34:53.020 --> 01:34:56.860
And then in terms of then
the downturn and the economic

01:34:56.860 --> 01:34:59.110
recession-- because
we always have them--

01:34:59.110 --> 01:35:02.530
probably-- maybe
later part of that--

01:35:02.530 --> 01:35:04.910
2019, or something
along those lines.

01:35:04.910 --> 01:35:06.340
But I can't be--

01:35:06.340 --> 01:35:07.814
it would be something like that.

01:35:07.814 --> 01:35:08.480
AUDIENCE: Right.

01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:08.979
Thanks.

01:35:12.349 --> 01:35:13.640
AUDIENCE: Thank you for coming.

01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:14.210
I appreciate--

01:35:14.210 --> 01:35:15.168
RAY DALIO: My pleasure.

01:35:15.168 --> 01:35:17.170
AUDIENCE: --your talk
and presentation.

01:35:17.170 --> 01:35:19.630
One question that
I had was I know

01:35:19.630 --> 01:35:23.800
that Bridgewater has been
producing investment theses

01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:24.316
for--

01:35:24.316 --> 01:35:25.940
well, since the
beginning and I think--

01:35:25.940 --> 01:35:27.220
RAY DALIO: Investment what?

01:35:27.220 --> 01:35:27.970
AUDIENCE: Theses.

01:35:27.970 --> 01:35:28.720
RAY DALIO: Theses.

01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:29.220
Yeah.

01:35:29.220 --> 01:35:30.144
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:35:30.144 --> 01:35:31.060
RAY DALIO: Principles.

01:35:31.060 --> 01:35:31.560
Yeah.

01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:33.070
AUDIENCE: Um-hmm.

01:35:33.070 --> 01:35:37.030
To what extent are
you willing to--

01:35:37.030 --> 01:35:40.410
and maybe this is a request
rather than anything else--

01:35:40.410 --> 01:35:42.640
are you willing
to open those up?

01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:45.235
Also, possibly past ones
and previous examples?

01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:51.490
RAY DALIO: I did a 30 minute
video called "How the Economic

01:35:51.490 --> 01:35:56.530
Machine Works," which if you
haven't seen, people think--

01:35:56.530 --> 01:36:00.160
and so it exemplifies
how I think

01:36:00.160 --> 01:36:04.300
it's going to be helpful and
not harmful to Bridgewater

01:36:04.300 --> 01:36:07.930
for conveying economic
principles and market

01:36:07.930 --> 01:36:09.610
principles in general.

01:36:09.610 --> 01:36:14.160
We will not get into our exact
algorithms that are going to--

01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:16.660
that we would say would
lessen our ability

01:36:16.660 --> 01:36:18.190
to do what we do well.

01:36:18.190 --> 01:36:19.362
AUDIENCE: Of course.

01:36:19.362 --> 01:36:21.820
RAY DALIO: But there'll be--
you know, I'm writing a book--

01:36:21.820 --> 01:36:25.111
"Economic Investment
Principles"-- which will--

01:36:25.111 --> 01:36:28.924
I don't know-- it might be
18 months or so out there.

01:36:28.924 --> 01:36:30.340
AUDIENCE: I'll
look forward to it.

01:36:30.340 --> 01:36:31.470
Thank you.

01:36:31.470 --> 01:36:33.881
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Well, thank
you, Ray, for joining us.

01:36:33.881 --> 01:36:35.380
RAY DALIO: I think
there are three--

01:36:35.380 --> 01:36:37.500
you know your timeline.

01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:39.784
You're the boss.

01:36:39.784 --> 01:36:41.950
JORDAN THIBODEAU: We'll see
if we can do it offline.

01:36:41.950 --> 01:36:43.460
But thank you very
much for joining us.

01:36:43.460 --> 01:36:44.460
We really appreciate it.

01:36:44.460 --> 01:36:45.860
You wrote an excellent book.

01:36:45.860 --> 01:36:48.221
And I hope everyone
goes and grabs it

01:36:48.221 --> 01:36:49.220
because it's phenomenal.

01:36:49.220 --> 01:36:50.975
Let's give Ray a
round of applause.

01:36:50.975 --> 01:36:51.850
RAY DALIO: Thank you.

01:36:51.850 --> 01:36:56.100
