00:00:03.461 --> 00:00:10.051
NARRATOR: Mullumbimby,
New South Wales, 1939.

00:00:10.051 --> 00:00:14.222
Frederick Slater, the president
of the Australian Archeology

00:00:14.222 --> 00:00:18.935
Society, was dispatched to
investigate the discovery

00:00:18.935 --> 00:00:22.480
of a complex aboriginal
arrangement consisting

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.735
of 188 standing stones.

00:00:26.735 --> 00:00:30.864
Slater dubbed the formation
the Stonehenge of Australia

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:33.908
and became convinced that it
was one of the oldest temple

00:00:33.908 --> 00:00:37.412
complexes in the world,
predating those found

00:00:37.412 --> 00:00:39.038
in Europe and the Middle East.

00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:45.628
Frederick Slater found that
the site he was investigating

00:00:45.628 --> 00:00:50.300
was part of a larger,
much larger site,

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.012
and it fitted in very closely
with aboriginal sacred lore,

00:00:54.012 --> 00:00:56.055
myths, and legends.

00:00:56.055 --> 00:01:01.102
After a time, Frederick Slater
began to posit and suggest

00:01:01.102 --> 00:01:04.939
that instead of out
of Africa, that maybe

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:07.275
we should re-examine
the evolution

00:01:07.275 --> 00:01:10.236
of man as out of Australia.

00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:12.530
He took a massive
leap and started

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.492
declaring that in ancient
times in Australia,

00:01:15.492 --> 00:01:18.703
the Aborigines were more
advanced than any culture

00:01:18.703 --> 00:01:21.956
that he could recount
on the planet.

00:01:21.956 --> 00:01:24.709
He was declared almost
insane by the rest

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:26.836
of the academic community.

00:01:26.836 --> 00:01:30.131
The landowners were so
terrified of the controversy

00:01:30.131 --> 00:01:32.801
that it implied
that it was pretty

00:01:32.801 --> 00:01:34.177
much destroyed by bulldozers.

00:01:39.516 --> 00:01:42.477
There are many stone
circles throughout the British

00:01:42.477 --> 00:01:44.979
Isles and Europe.

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.982
Stonehenge is one of
the most well known,

00:01:47.982 --> 00:01:50.109
but they all have
some relationship

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:54.823
to astronomical observatories.

00:01:54.823 --> 00:01:57.784
This Aboriginal
Stonehenge would really

00:01:57.784 --> 00:02:01.955
alter the way we think
of the Aboriginals

00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:05.041
and the sophistication
of their society,

00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:10.505
where they had astronomical and
archeo-astronomical structures

00:02:10.505 --> 00:02:13.341
that help them
monitor the heavens,

00:02:13.341 --> 00:02:18.137
much as standing stones
in Europe would have done.

00:02:18.137 --> 00:02:21.975
For our people, it went beyond
the paintings and the carvings

00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:23.977
into stone arrangements.

00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:26.896
We would arrange in
certain patterns, which

00:02:26.896 --> 00:02:29.691
relate to the
constellation of the stars,

00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:33.736
in regards to our connectedness
with the sky world

00:02:33.736 --> 00:02:36.990
and where we originate from.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.951
NARRATOR: Could the so-called
aboriginal Stonehenge

00:02:39.951 --> 00:02:43.371
provide insight into the
other stone arrangements found

00:02:43.371 --> 00:02:46.249
scattered throughout the world?

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:48.960
If so, might they
serve to provide

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.921
a permanent record of a
significant connection

00:02:51.921 --> 00:02:52.964
to another world?

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:02.849
Uluru Rock, also
known as a Ayers Rock,

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:06.644
is located nearly in the
center of the continent

00:03:06.644 --> 00:03:11.649
over 1,200 miles from the
nearest major Australian city.

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:14.736
This geological anomaly
is one of the largest

00:03:14.736 --> 00:03:18.823
isolated rocks in the world.

00:03:18.823 --> 00:03:25.330
It is over two miles long
and rises over 1,100 feet.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:31.210
It is, in fact, the exposed tip
of a huge vertical slab of rock

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:34.047
that continues below the
surface for three miles.

00:03:38.384 --> 00:03:44.182
It is a huge sedimentary
boulder that's gigantic sitting

00:03:44.182 --> 00:03:46.893
there in the middle
of the desert,

00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:49.771
and geologists
cannot really explain

00:03:49.771 --> 00:03:54.317
how Ayres Rock came to be.

00:03:54.317 --> 00:03:59.364
It's almost as if it was
lifted up from somewhere else

00:03:59.364 --> 00:04:03.326
and brought to the
center of the continent

00:04:03.326 --> 00:04:04.577
and then just dumped there.

00:04:07.538 --> 00:04:10.124
NARRATOR: For the
indigenous population,

00:04:10.124 --> 00:04:13.211
Uluru is one of their
most sacred sites

00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:15.463
and a place of pilgrimage.

00:04:15.463 --> 00:04:18.883
They consider it the
navel of the earth.

00:04:18.883 --> 00:04:22.262
For the aboriginal
cosmologies, a lot of times

00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:25.515
the landscape itself is sort
of like the Bible and heaven

00:04:25.515 --> 00:04:27.475
rolled into one.

00:04:27.475 --> 00:04:30.687
So in places like
Uluru, Ayers Rock,

00:04:30.687 --> 00:04:33.731
this rock has great significance
because they built this

00:04:33.731 --> 00:04:37.819
into their cultural memories
of when the world was formed

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:41.614
by sky spirits coming to earth.
