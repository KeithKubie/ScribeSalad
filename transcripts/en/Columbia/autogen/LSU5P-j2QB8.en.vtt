happening was interruption related to
 

00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:42.140
happening was interruption related to

00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:42.150
multiple moves within within the system
 

00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:44.570
multiple moves within within the system
so every time you move home you very

00:40:44.570 --> 00:40:44.580
