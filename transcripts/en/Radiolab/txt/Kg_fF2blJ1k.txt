Speaker 1:          00:00          Oh, Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad, I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab today things. And our next story involves one thing, three people. Craig, I'm Craig childs. So you just heard I'm a writer and traveler from western Colorado. Ragan I'm Reagan Choi. I'm an artist and a mother and an educator know each other. Oh yeah, we're married. Okay. And finally [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:26          Derek Vaughn. I was a street cop in a, mostly Denver.

Speaker 1:          00:29          Craig's a unlikely best buddy.

Speaker 3:          00:31          I mean, if we'd had been at school together, I would have just beat the shit out of him in the playground, you know, you know, we drive each other mad, but in the end we can, we can still scramble around just fine.

Speaker 2:          00:41          Part of what joined us is, were we were in love with, with wilderness

Speaker 1:          00:46          for years. They would take these trips together out into the Wilderness of Colorado or Utah.

Speaker 3:          00:51          No maps, no GPS, no trails, no campfires. Even Derek and I would go off for weeks in the desert together. Uh, I think the longest trip we took was a month out just, just wandering, looking for routes.

Speaker 1:          01:05          And it was on one of these trips that they made a discovery that I think it's fair to say, still haunts them today and recently almost killed one of our producers. So we'd been out for a couple of days on this particular occasion. The three of them are together and there are a couple of days into a hike. Where are we again? Where in Utah is that right? Yeah, Utah, I think desert, but rocky, slick rock, sandstone cliffs, Canyon land. So they're hiking through all these canyons

Speaker 3:          01:30          and, and we actually, we split up, Reagan said she wanted to set her own camp and so she stayed in one canyon and Dirk and I popped over into the next canyon over. Really? You just

Speaker 1:          01:40          does that? Is that a normal thing or were you guys fighting? No, that's normal. We weren't fighting at all. It's one of the great things about being out together is that, ah, there's an ease with that. [inaudible] separating as part of that.

Speaker 3:          01:51          Yeah. And I think Reagan was looking at Dirk and me and saying, you guys are, are going to go scrambling and get weird. Um, I, I'm gonna stay over here. I don't know if that was the case.

Speaker 1:          02:04          Well, part of it was just that I, I was at least five months pregnant and I was just starting to have a really hard time tightening my backpack so that the weight wasn't all on my shoulders. And she says, well, she was hiking, the pregnancy hormones were giving her bouts of Vertigo. It wouldn't, it was just starting to hit her like, wow, in a couple of months things are going to be really different. So she needed some alone time. She set her own camp, Dirk and Craig, meanwhile scale up this cliff face to get to the next canyon over.

Speaker 2:          02:31          And when we get to the very close to the top and there's a little flat area,

Speaker 1:          02:36          this balcony of rock overlooking the Canyon below this little ledge. So we said, well, okay, let's just sit here and have some lunch, break out the pipe, smoking some pot. Exactly.

Speaker 2:          02:46          So we sit down and, and

Speaker 4:          02:54          Ah,

Speaker 2:          02:54          and we literally both have like the first lung full when

Speaker 1:          03:00          Craig decides to take his backpack off

Speaker 3:          03:02          and he leans over and I noticed as I'm bending over a, uh, a round object underneath the edge of a [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          03:10          bolder back under the shadow and [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          03:13          he says, Hey, there's a pot under there. [inaudible] straight vertically below you. I'm eye to eye with it. And then I, I dropped to my knees and looked into this shadow and there was this beautiful red

Speaker 5:          03:31          jar, low and flat covered and maybe 700, 800, it'd be a thousand years of dust that

Speaker 3:          03:37          it's a kindness called a seed jar with just this narrow mouth on the top. And it had black paint design around the, around the mouth. We're talking about a [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          03:48          early Pueblo people, cliff dwellers, people who lived out in that desert a thousand years ago. And as he looked closer, he could see that this particular,

Speaker 3:          03:57          it had a crack down the front of it and it had two holes drilled around the crack. And then a piece of Yucca twine had been used to tie the holes together so it was precious to somebody. Yeah. So they might have left it there. Maybe it was during a migration thinking they would return at some time. Maybe they were on the run, but maybe someone was hiding it from other people. Yes. You don't know who it was, if it was male or female or what clan or any of those stories, but you know it was a human being in the same position that you're in right there.

Speaker 4:          04:27          Mm.

Speaker 3:          04:30          Doing the same thing, the same gesture. You can see the hand reaching out and placing the object. You can imagine the hands and the feet and the people in the sounds that they would make.

Speaker 1:          04:52          They stared at it for about an hour, not really saying much and then suddenly it just hits Dirk. Oh wait a second, we've got to move this thing. Somebody else was going to find this. It just felt like if we can just kind of luck into it. What's to stop some four wheel driving by beetle villager from doing the same cause it's an access route. I don't know. I felt sort of protective of it cause you know, pot hunters were all over the southwest looting dig sites and that jar would be worth a lot of money. Tens of thousands of dollars. At least you don't have to make sure that they somehow didn't get their hands on this. And so I thought, well let's hide it. Crepe is like [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          05:29          No, I said have absolutely not. The moment we touched that jar, it no longer is part of that story. It's now part of our story. He's a purist. We, we do not move this thing, not move it. Protect it. Let's cover it. Like I wanted to build a corral of stone around it to like camouflage it. That's exactly what I'd be looking for. In fact, I wouldn't notice the, the seed jar, I'd noticed the rock and I would go, Ooh, somebody, somebody's hiding something. Yeah, it right. Dirks looking at me going, you and your Yoda crap. God Dang. And he says, we could give this another 700 years of life. Hell it had been there probably a thousand years. [inaudible] how do you resolve that? Said, you know, we'll come back tomorrow. We'll just leave it for now.

Speaker 6:          06:12          Oh, so you left, you left in a draw. We left in a draw and we actually, uh, hopped back over the canyon to find Reagan. Reagan's kind of like this bad ass Samurai chick. I thought, wow. Oh yeah, I can, I'll be able to draft Reagan over to my side. So they hiked back up to that ledge, yelled out for her and the next day she hiked on over to where they were. I remember her hitching up her pants, pregnancy style and kind of squatting down to get in there. What was your first thought when you saw it? Um,

Speaker 4:          06:43          focus [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          06:49          and just being right there. Completely consumed in that moment. And I think it went on for a long time cause eventually they're like, so what do you think when you hear the truth? Like what we should do? Oh, you guys argued back and forth for at least an hour and a half and I just ignored you for most of it cause I was just looking at the seed jar. I wasn't really thinking to be in the position of arbiter, but I just got fed up and I was like, that's enough. You guys leave it alone.

Speaker 6:          07:15          It's part of an ongoing story. Like just give it up, leave it alone.

Speaker 4:          07:20          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          07:20          and so, so she takes some pictures and we and we walk away

Speaker 4:          07:30          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          07:30          and within a year of that moment, everything just like went whirlwind. Reagan and Greg had a baby. Craig decides to become a writer. He writes a book, it becomes a bestseller. I quit the business and got divorced and everything changed. But even on that day they knew with this will be the center of things we talk about for the rest of our lives. The seed jar. Yeah. The day we found the seed jar. Do you think it's still there? I think it's still there. I think it is the route's pretty complicated with that particular location? No, I'd say 50 50

Speaker 4:          08:13          taught. Huh?

Speaker 6:          08:18          Again, if only that were the end of the story.

Speaker 1:          08:23          I don't know. He said he went, yeah, we could have done the thing where you're just like, oh, the narrative power of objects met a blah blah. No, we were like, it's the damn thing there. Or did someone take it? We got so curious about this that we convinced Craig Reagan and Dirk to go back. Now they're here and check and we sent our producer Molly Webster along for the ride. It's half the camp is just around. Yeah, we've been, I didn't realize when they were like giving each other a hug the night at camp and I was

Speaker 7:          08:56          there with my recorders in their faces that like was, it was actually like a big moment. I guess this is a reunion trip. We haven't seen Dirk in ages. Reagan had said that one of the last times now that people have kids and families, one of the last times you were together was the CJR. Yay. We're so happy. And so they were really, really, really excited to like be together. Wait, how long ago was this when they found, the thing is 11 years ago. This was 11 years ago. Yeah. So the kids were, Reagan was five months pregnant and the kids, she was pregnant with his Jasper turn off the light and come on out, come say hi. Who's now let, he just had his 11th birthday. Me Line back, close the door and come say hi. Hi. Hey Man, I'm Molly. We were on dirt.

Speaker 7:          09:45          Derek had never met their kids. Well he happened that, but the last time you said Jasper, Jasper was a baby. And the other thing is, I'm just going to say Craig and Dirk are like brothers from another mother. Oh yeah. Like they are like the bestest bro Man. Like every scene. They love each other so much. So anyway, so we, so we get there and we'd like drop our bags, we go to sleep and uh, the sleep bag woke up, four wheel drove or drive. I don't actually know how it goes out into the Mesas Park, the cars. And then we hiked a mile and a half to the edge of the Mesa. Wow. Basically the entire landscape felt like they had just put me on a bonanza set, like gnarled wharfie trees, red, red, sandy sandstone there, you're on this Mesa and then it falls off into this canyon and then there's like another Mesa and then that falls off into a canyon. There's another mason than that and it's just this like unending landscape.

Speaker 8:          10:50          Bad luck. We're floating up here now.

Speaker 4:          10:52          Yeah,

Speaker 7:          10:57          and there shit, is it just like [inaudible]? There's no sound cars license, no sounds, no nothing.

Speaker 8:          11:05          And is it intranet? We don't know. We came out the top and across when we went back to get Rick and basically our objective was to go somewhere into this like canyon land down to where Reagan was camped before. Yeah. And come along there and somehow find like a tiny little seed jar. It's weird to go back because I like to think of it like this is going to change things if it's, if it's not there, I'm going to be so mad. I like to be out in the world and just think about it. Just go, okay, there's, there's a se jar sitting there under a boulder right now and it will be there for the longest time. And, and it's just quiet.

Speaker 4:          11:48          [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          11:50          then I can imagine that the wind going around it and, and more sand building up and, and it's just this really nice thought of isolation and perpetuity.

Speaker 9:          12:05          [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          12:05          hello. I kind of want to hear it echo. So we set up camp on the edge of a Mesa and then we all went to sleep. W what's the Futon? Flute. That's Craig apparently has a flute in his bag. Derek calls him flute. Boy. It was weirdly appropriate. So anyway, so we, so we, we wake up like first lights today. The day guys,

Speaker 8:          12:30          today's the day we go find out if, uh, if the egg is still there in the nest,

Speaker 7:          12:34          today's the day we start hiking, we go down this 800 foot descent, whatever those rocks. No femurs are broken and we strap this. Yeah, the Anasazi were some tough people like wind around this canyon on these cliffsides through a saddle in the back of another canyon.

Speaker 4:          13:02          [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          13:02          and how long did this hike take to get out there? It probably took six, maybe seven hours. Wow. We're going pretty slow. The kids were amazing. Um, but also slow cause it was starting to like starting to bug Dirk. I think it's the way to say it. It's really hard.

Speaker 8:          13:24          Seven straight overhead I think. Go into up having to park the kids somewhere. [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          13:30          sure enough at the end of the six hour hike, I believe your pack so that they've got extra water and snacks. Yeah. Uh, the kids need a break and so we sort of believe them in an alcove on the side of the canyon. What we'll spray out where it is and then we'll get you so you guys go. Anyway, I brought my book. Okay. Bye guys. And Reagan's like, all right boys, you have your emergency whistles. Remember three times, but no joking. Okay. Final ascent. You know, we went up. That

Speaker 8:          13:59          ain't go, we went up that diagonal there. I remember it. Really. Okay. Really clearly. I'm all behind you.

Speaker 7:          14:03          So there's this, we were slammed up against this canyon wall. We needed to get over it just to get up and the only way to do that was that there was a boulder sort of out in front of the Canyon Wall and it created this skinny little shoot and we had to wedge ourselves into the shoot and like go up. And I think getting up on it, 60 feet

Speaker 4:          14:22          don't think about their model.

Speaker 7:          14:28          I'd like to get off this plans. I had to like put my back against one wall and there you go. My feet against the other push between the two walls. And I had this moment where before I left, Dylan told me not to die for radio lab. So I paused and I was like, okay, don't do this for radio lab yourself,

Speaker 4:          14:54          just laying there.

Speaker 7:          15:04          It's every everyday now again,

Speaker 4:          15:09          hi

Speaker 7:          15:12          time we get done with the gnarliest scent. Everyone's like see is going to be there cause no one else would do this. That was really hard to spot this whole down. I've been so Durkin Craig are like, okay, this is it. We did that route. I am absolutely. The seed jar should be around here somewhere

Speaker 4:          15:35          where like walking

Speaker 7:          15:39          giant tumbled boulders looking under. You've got like a quarter of a mile of canyon phase to figure it out. Just giant tumbled boulders. Craig thinks it's to the left. Dirk thinks it's to the right. Anything Derek? No, it's weird because, does it look familiar? Ah, this I, this is, this is it. This is this.

Speaker 10:         16:04          It's been 11 years.

Speaker 7:          16:06          Yeah, but I just, I know this is,

Speaker 10:         16:09          that's fine. I know.

Speaker 7:          16:12          Don't see the same

Speaker 4:          16:14          bought. It's just getting trickier and trickier. You're like just going like really confused work that far down. We did.

Speaker 10:         16:26          I've been lucky. I don't know for an hour

Speaker 7:          16:32          and it all like looks the same but just everything looks the same to an untrained eye. Right? It's like where's Waldo land and we're trying to find Malto cover, find Craig, get his thoughts. I finally see Craig kind of far off down the canyon standing by himself, just staring at the ground and I was like, hey, like, okay, and you lock. I went down and looked at what would be, has been our likely route up. Yeah, which is right up through here and he points to the ground like right where we're standing and he says, I think it's like right here. I think like this was the place.

Speaker 8:          17:14          I don't want to think about this particular possibility. See all that stuff. I just walked across. It went, yeah, that's all fresh. Oh, seriously? Yeah.

Speaker 7:          17:26          Wait, what does that mean fresh? Well, we were standing on this pile of really sharp rock. It was just all of these sharp little jaggedy knives. I mean it sort of didn't look like any of the other areas we had been in. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          17:40          Yeah. It's possible that the cliff has fallen here and covered everything. The top of

Speaker 4:          17:50          that cliff,

Speaker 7:          17:52          if you looked above us to the top of the cliff was like someone had just taken a meat cleaver to it. It was just like sliced off. This whole thing broke off the entire cliff face had fallen off and annihilated everything. Hundreds of feet in either direction.

Speaker 6:          18:11          It's been totally destroyed. Yeah, I mean it wouldn't have survived. Even the giant boulder protecting it like it's just, it's been wiped clean.

Speaker 7:          18:23          It reminded me of like an iceberg on caffeine. You see all those videos of like the front of the iceberg just all of a sudden cleaves off. That's exactly what happened on this one.

Speaker 10:         18:32          So you're talking like 10,000 tons of rock falling here. Just

Speaker 4:          18:46          yeah, I mean I know that's not what I was thinking. What's the possibility?

Speaker 6:          19:04          And I'm not swallowing it just yet.

Speaker 7:          19:06          So he calls in Reagan, Reagan come Torta and then Dirk comes wandering over.

Speaker 6:          19:12          It does kind of make sense I guess. No, if the pot's been here for 700 years, it does make sense at all. They would have, but no less 11 year. Why it's not looking right here. It was right in here. I know it was here. No, no, no, no. Oh my God.

Speaker 7:          19:39          Craig's like leaning against the wall.

Speaker 4:          19:42          Hmm.

Speaker 7:          19:43          Derek was like, wow man, I guess I guess this must be it. And there was this real like it, we're grappling with something and I was like trying to figure out like what they were grappling with and Craig just kept talking to me like not actually about the seed jar, but about the place. This is where, yeah,

Speaker 6:          20:04          I remember Reagan hoisting up her pants, pregnant squatting and Derek and me on our knees looking in on this thing for the longest time. You know, it was very clear in my mind to have the place itself gone. It's, I'm fine. It's beautiful, it's wonderful. But Jesus, this is a different kind of sadness and it wasn't quite no. Are you sad? Yeah. This kinda sucks.

Speaker 4:          20:42          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          20:42          if it was missing, if somebody had taken it, that'd be a sad of like, oh, screw people. Why do you do this? This is

Speaker 4:          20:52          [inaudible].

Speaker 6:          20:52          This is gravity.

Speaker 4:          21:06          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          21:07          Derek's gone. We should start moving. Yeah. Alright. That's why I think it's perfect. It doesn't seem like an irony at all. Just let it go. You're going to break into song. Let it go. Pick a little TACO. G, G, g c wants to hear what it is. Like a mountain goat. Pretty sure.
