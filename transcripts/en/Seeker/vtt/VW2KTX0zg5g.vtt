00:00:01.569 --> 00:00:06.720
This is a story about clandestine operations,
international intrigue, and jealously guarded

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:07.720
secrets.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.280
It’s about engineering marvels and technological
nightmares.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.889
It’s a big story.

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:21.090
But it stars very, very small...inside a cigar
box full of letters.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.390
Melinda Hess is a filmmaker who came across
letters her father had written in 1946.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.740
Her father, Sanford Hess, died in 1989.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:35.030
But in 1946 he was a young private in the
US Army, deployed to Fort Bliss, Texas and

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.930
corresponding with his parents back in New
York City.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.750
The War was over, and Sandy Hess, a promising
young mechanical engineer, found himself stationed

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.739
deep in the Southwest working on….something.

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:48.120
Here’s Melinda.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.899
I didn’t know very much about my father’s
time in the military.

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:51.969
I knew that he was an engineer, and i knew
he had not seen any quote “action” in

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:52.969
World War II.

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:57.649
And I had a vague awareness that he was in
New Mexico.

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:02.730
The letters from Fort Bliss bore an address
that piqued Melinda’s curiosity: Ordnance

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.049
Research &amp; Development Sub-Office (Rocket).

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.659
So I started going through the letters…and
I started reading them out loud, and there

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:13.939
were various names coming through.

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:16.890
A few things kept recurring: Germans.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.570
Wernher von Braun.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.090
Engineers.White Sands Missile Range.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.090
Jewish.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.090
V-two.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.829
So, Melinda began to read about it all.

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:33.409
...and as I began to google and do some more
research, I was completely blown away by what

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:34.720
was revealed.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.479
The V-2 in those letters was the world’s
first long-range guided ballistic missile…and

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:43.140
it was developed by Nazi Germany.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.190
The V2, which in German stands for “Retribution
Weapon 2”, rained down on allied cities,

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.530
chiefly London, and killed thousands of civilians.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.280
The missile also took its toll on German soil:
the Nazis used concentration camp labor to

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.270
build the V2s, and thousands of prisoners
died in the process.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.370
Nightmarish as it was, the V-2 represented
some seriously advanced technology...and when

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:23.570
Germany fell in 1945, the United States went
to great lengths to recover it.

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.540
In the years following the war, the US military’s
“Operation Paperclip” brought more than

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.710
100 German scientists and engineers to America,
most notably V-2 project architect Wernher

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.410
von Braun.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.850
They also imported literal trainloads of rocket
components.

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.881
Overall, the project was an American effort
to develop Nazi tech, on American soil, for

00:02:42.881 --> 00:02:45.830
American gain .

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.150
And that is what a young Sandy Hess describes
in all those letters.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.410
Reading them gave Melinda a very personal
look at a secretive and pivotal project.

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.160
Here’s one passage, read by Melinda:

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.990
I will be the only American engineer in the
test section.

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:06.740
I will work with the Germans on the tests
and write reports, etc....They call themselves

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.910
“prisoners of peace” and are treated very
well.

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.340
I will work under a dr.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.830
Schilling and with about 15 others.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.030
What a crazy set-up!

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.390
And there’s one other detail that makes
this all the crazier still: Melinda is Jewish.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.520
Her father, Private Sandy Hess, was Jewish.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.100
And his letters reveal more than a little
discomfort about working with Germans:

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:37.860
The major asked me if I had any animosity
towards them, and I truthfully answered “yes.”

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.680
He explained that he feels the same way, but
I must realize that they are working for the

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.680
U.S.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.760
Government and I must treat them like co-workers.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.680
And that’s exactly what he did.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.270
In the letters Sandy describes befriending
and working well with his German colleagues...though

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:58.390
at the time, none of them could know how historic
their work would become.

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.810
Under American direction, the V-2 program
evolved, splintered, and eventually led to

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:08.530
the Saturn family of rockets...the very same
rockets that sent Apollo astronauts to the

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:09.530
Moon.

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.180
Meaning that lots of Project Paperclip scientists,
including Wernher von Braun, ultimately ended

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.130
up working for NASA.

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.980
In short, our space program owes a lot to
a careful collaboration between ex-Nazis and

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.200
American Jews.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.910
Back in the present, Melinda is the filmmaker
in residence at the Jewish Film Institute

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:29.910
in San Francisco.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.380
She’s producing a big documentary project
about her father and his involvement in Project

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.230
Paperclip.

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:40.200
And when she’s done, all the letters in
that little cigar box will end up in national

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.490
archives.

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:46.060
Personal as they are, they help tell the story
of a world finding its equilibrium again after

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.530
years of violence and fear.

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.570
The Germans certainly treat me wonderfully,
and with the greatest respect.

00:04:54.570 --> 00:05:01.210
(I wonder how they would act if they knew
I was Jewish, or do they) Anyway, they are

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.980
certainly a brilliant group and I am very
enthused about my work.

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:11.860
So, here at DNews we’re on a real military
history kick - and if you are too, check out

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.621
this video about the crazy Cold War communications
network that helped the US guard against a

00:05:16.621 --> 00:05:18.670
Soviet North Pole sneak attack!

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:35.280
And if you want even more space history, check
out my channel, Vintage Space!

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.569
And as always, thanks for watching.
