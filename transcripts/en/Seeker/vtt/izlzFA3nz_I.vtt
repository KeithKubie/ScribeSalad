00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:10.960
Hi quick thinkers and slowpokes, it’s Julian
for DNews.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.269
Tim Welsh, a professor of Kinesiology at the
University of Toronto recently wrote an article

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.930
asking, “what is the speed of thought?”

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.310
It’s a great question with a lot of different
answers because thoughts can be huge complex

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.180
puzzles or simple reflexes.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.369
They can originate internally or from external
stimuli, and different people can have the

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:30.470
same thought at different speeds.

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.200
We thought we’d offer our own answer and
to give us somewhere to start, let’s talk

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.260
about the basic unit of a thought.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.580
A thought can be billions of neurons interacting
with each other at once, swapping chemicals

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:41.930
between them to communicate.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.839
So it could be said the most basic unit of
thought is a neuron firing.

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:49.470
Neurons in your brain consist of cell bodies
with dendrites branching from it, as well

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.420
as an axon that splits several times at the
end.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.800
People know that neurons send electrical impulses
but it’s not like the electricity in your

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.339
house that works by passing freely moving
electrons, so it’s not as instantaneous.

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:04.800
Instead neurons swap ions of different charges
across the membrane of the axon.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.900
By swapping them at the start of the axon
by the cell body, it starts a chain reaction

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.650
down its length, like a row of people doing
the wave.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.070
When the signal gets to the end of the axon,
the synaptic bundle will release neurotransmitters

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.811
across the synaptic cleft, which is the tiny
space between the end of one neuron and the

00:01:20.811 --> 00:01:22.000
beginning of the next.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.390
The neurotransmitters float to the next neuron’s
dendrites, and they tell the next neuron how

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:27.390
to fire.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.310
So the total time it takes a cell to send
an impulse down its axon and then diffuse

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.090
a neurotransmitter across the synapse is our
most basic unit, and of course, this being

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.300
the brain we’re talking about, it gets even
more complicated.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.630
Because axons can either belong to gray matter
or white matter.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.050
40% of your brain’s volume is gray matter,
it’s what you use for sensory perception,

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.950
speech, memory, emotions, and decision making.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.860
It’s dense with cell bodies and the axons
are short and don’t have a fatty protein

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.680
called myelin surrounding them.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.420
White matter on the other hand doesn’t do
the thought processing but is vital for connecting

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.000
different areas of gray matter because it
has that myelin sheath.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.110
That sheath is like the difference between
a fiber optic cable and a 56k modem.

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.090
Without it, grey matter sends its electrical
pulses at .5 to 10 meters per second.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.739
With it, white matter’s action potential
can travel up to 150 meters per second.

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:22.379
It needs that speed, because white matter
axons in a man in his 20s can total over 176,000

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:23.659
kilometers.

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:27.230
The axons in white matter can be up to a meter
long, which is good because that means fewer

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.359
synapses slowing the signal down.

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:32.819
A synapse is a gap between neurons of only
20 nanometers.

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.140
Some transmissions across the synapse can
be quick; if the neurotransmitter opens up

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.760
the ion channels right away, the whole process
can take just half a millisecond.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.489
Most receptors however use the neurotransmitter
to release another molecule and that secondary

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.730
messenger opens up the ion channels.

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.459
That can delay the signal anywhere from 30
milliseconds to a full second.

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:57.109
So between axon length, axon type, and neurotransmitter
used, there’s a lot of variability in the

00:02:57.109 --> 00:02:59.620
speed an individual neuron can send a message.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.579
Now consider that a single neuron can have
links with thousands of other neurons, meaning

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:10.080
your brain can have hundreds of trillions
of synapses between its 86 billion neurons.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.879
Plus there are different kinds of thought,
like reflexes fast tracked to the spinal cord

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:17.819
or complex decisions that use billions of
neurons across your brain.

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:21.870
All of these variables mean thoughts can be
had and carried out at vastly different speeds.

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.450
It’s why some thoughts can be nearly instantaneous,
like a sprinter starting to move only 150

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.599
milliseconds after a starter’s pistol; while
others take much longer, like deciding whether

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:32.469
or not you should tell your crush how you
feel.

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:34.749
It is possible to think faster though.

00:03:34.749 --> 00:03:38.519
Reactions can become reflexes with practice,
taking neurons and distance a signal has to

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.040
travel out of the equation to speed a thought
up.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.109
Or complex decisions can be made quicker with
practice too.

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:47.590
Making different parts of your brain communicate
by learning and considering new information

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.510
can improve the structural integrity of the
white matter used, letting it send signals

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.209
faster, making you better at processing information.

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.610
It’s another great reason to keep coming
back for more DNews.

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.450
I know, shameless plug.

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.330
You probably have about 86 billion neurons
rolling around up there, and you may think

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.290
you only use 10% of them.

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.290
You don’t.

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.499
I hate that factoid and Anthony Carboni agrees.

00:04:07.499 --> 00:04:17.320
Here’s the video 
with the truth.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:23.190
What are your thoughts on thoughts?

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.169
Are you quick at learning and thinking or
do you need more practice?
