00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.690
One of the most
interesting articles

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.523
I've come across in the
last couple of years

00:00:16.523 --> 00:00:20.540
is Alain de Botton's article
on the fact that museums

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.630
need to do a better
job at creating spaces

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.920
that trigger encounters
with the sacred.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.880
In other words, he thinks
that we need better secular

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.860
institutions in which to
experience the transcendent.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.670
Human beings long for these
encounters with the epic,

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.440
to rub up against the numinous.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.665
We wake up and we want
our lives to have meaning.

00:00:41.665 --> 00:00:43.970
So we go to church on Sunday.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.370
We look at beautiful
cathedrals and experience

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.030
some kind of awe, whether
or not we are believers.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.660
The spaces themselves
seem to induce it.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.490
And religions
understand this well.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.150
But do secular institutions?

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:56.820
I mean, aside from
the movie theater,

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.880
aside from the IMAX
screen occasionally

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.550
playing a film like Inception
and conjuring up the cosmic awe

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.160
that only brilliant
sci-fi can conjure,

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.770
we don't have that many
spaces for this kind of stuff.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.310
You know, there was an article
called "Golden Eye," written

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.640
by Ross Andersen, that spoke
of the Hubble Space Telescope

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.430
and how it was an
instrument of man.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.110
It was the eye of
man, an exoskeleton

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.620
of man's optic nerve,
literally allowing

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.590
us to mainline the whole of
time through the optic nerve.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.260
And it does allow us to do that.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.790
The Hubble,
instruments of science

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.510
that expand what we can see,
they do expand our minds.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.315
They do help us rub up
against the numinous,

00:01:34.315 --> 00:01:37.300
the intricate order, the
pattern that connects.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.230
This is the thing
that these things do,

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.210
but only under certain
compressed modes

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:42.090
of presentations.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.130
If it wasn't for Ross
Andersen's overly articulated

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.630
poetic distillation of
what the Hubble does,

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.820
I might not have
thought of it that way.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.086
If I didn't have
the context in which

00:01:52.086 --> 00:01:53.585
to understand the
role of the Hubble

00:01:53.585 --> 00:01:55.300
in expanding human
consciousness,

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.890
I might not have been able
to appreciate it fully.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.140
And so, again, going back
to the Alain de Botton idea,

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.400
how can we create more spaces,
more institutions, more

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.560
interfaces that mediate our
encounters with the epic,

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.600
our encounters with the sacred?

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.158
Because we need that.
