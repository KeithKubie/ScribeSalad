00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.730
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.210
&gt;&gt; Dan Turello: Good afternoon,
welcome to our program,

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.100
the origins of the RNA world:
a collective oral history.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.410
We're glad you're here, we're
glad the Metro shutdown yesterday

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:30.710
and not today.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.010
This is a good thing.

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:37.050 position:56%
I'm Dan Turello, I'm on staff of the
Kluge Center and before we begin,

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.020
I want to remind you
of a couple of items,

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.660
we 're recording today's
conversation for future placement

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.930
on the library's YouTube
and iTunes channels

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.950
and also please turn off any
cell phones or any other devices

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.550
that might interfere
with the conversation.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.220
This afternoon's conversation
is being moderated

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.520
by Nathaniel Comfort.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.390
He is the Blumberg NASA Library
of Congress chair in astrobiology.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.520 position:56%
I'm going to introduce him in just
a few moments, but first a few words

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.580
about the Kluge Center and about
the Blumberg program as a whole.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:15.080
The Kluge Center was created 16
years ago thanks to a generous gift

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.180
by philanthropist John W. Kluge.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.130 position:56%
We have two primary roles, the first
is to create a scholarly community

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.980
of approximately a hundred
scholars every year.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.490
These are senior scholars,
postdoctoral fellows,

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.680
pre-doctoral fellows,
all of whom contribute

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.560
to a vibrant community here on
Capitol Hill and in the library.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.900
The second function is to
administer the Kluge prize.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.280
This is awarded by the
librarian of Congress,

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.870 position:56%
it's a one million dollar award
that recognizes lifetime achievement

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.170
in the study of humanity.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.290
It was last awarded to
philosophers JÃ¼rgen Habermas

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.190 position:56%
and Charles Taylor this past summer.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.650
So within the Kluge
Center, the Blumberg chair

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.650
in astrobiology is the result
of what has been a unique

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.880
and rewarding collaboration between
NASA and the Library of Congress.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.840
The chair takes its name from
Nobel Prize winner Barry Blumberg,

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.560
he was the founder of the
NASA Astrobiology Institute

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.300
and also a founding
member of the Library

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.550
of Congress Scholars Counsel.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.480
Blumberg envisioned the creation
of a chair in the Kluge Center

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.440
that would focus on the humanistic

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.850
and societal impacts
of astrobiology.

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.120
The idea was to connect
scientific discoveries in the field

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.160
of astrobiology with
the best thinking

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.500
in the humanities and
social sciences.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.650
And astrobiology is a field
of inquiry, in particular,

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.120
is one that allows
for the big questions.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.420
Things like investigations
on the origins of life

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.640
about which we are going to
hear more about this afternoon.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.400
So placing scientific knowledge
within the context of historical

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.210
and philosophical thinking gives
us the chance to consider questions

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:06.060
of meaning and of value that are
important to us as human beings.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.340
Nathaniel was the third
chair to be in residence.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.990 position:56%
Our first chair was David Grinspoon,
who I see sitting here in the back.

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.130
He researched a book
on the Anthropocene.

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.440
We then had historian
of science Steven Dick,

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.570
who wrote about the potential
societal impact of the discovery

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.010
of microbial or complex
life beyond earth,

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.130 position:56%
and this year we've been thrilled to
have Nathaniel with us since October

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.970
and he is looking at the
history of the genomic revolution

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.780
in origin of life research.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.700
In addition to holding the Blumberg
chair here at the Kluge Center,

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.550
Nathaniel is professor in
the department of the history

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.130
of medicine at the Johns
Hopkins University.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:51.020
He has published scores of
articles and several books,

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.250
I mentioned just a few
of the more salient ones.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.330
"The Science of Human Perfection:
How Genes Became the Heart

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:03.800
of American Medicine" published by
Yale in 2012, "The Tangled Field:

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.170
Barbara McClintock's
Search for the Patterns

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.890 position:56%
of Genetic Control" published by
Harvard in 2001, he' also the editor

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.480
of the volume "The
Panda's Black Box:

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.440
Opening Up the Intelligent
Design Debate" published

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.920
by Hopkins in 2007.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.160
He writes extensively for
the Atlantic, the Nation,

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.650
the New York Times book
review, and other outlets.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.230
He also blogs and so
you can look this up.

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.720
His blog is
genotopia.scienceblog.com.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.530
So we've been thrilled to
have him with us this year

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.630
and we' re grateful to him for
bringing such a distinguished group

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.890
of panelists to the library
today and we look forward

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.740
to a fascinating program.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.370
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort:
Well thank you Dan.

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:00.260
It's a real pleasure to be here
and I would just like to begin by,

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.830
with a word of thanks
to the Kluge Center.

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.700
This is an absolutely marvelous
and a unique place to be,

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:12.140
just tell you how great it is
when I got my acceptance letter,

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:16.290
it had a line in it saying that
we expect you to protect your time

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.490
for research and scholarship
and reflection .

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.790
Now how rare is that,
I mean in these days,

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:26.700
so this is a wonderful place
and I'm delighted to be here.

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:30.980
And I'm particularly thrilled
to have this distinguished panel

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:36.100
of guests with me today to
talk about the RNA world,

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:41.400
which is an important aspect of
research on the origin of life.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:46.910
And I'm just going to introduce
them briefly in alphabetical order,

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:50.260
first W. Ford Doolittle, who's

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.570
from Dalhousie University
in Halifax, Nova Scotia.

00:05:54.570 --> 00:06:00.490
He got a PhD in, his PhD in
biological sciences from Stanford,

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.740
he then did postdoctoral work

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:07.410
with the distinguished scientists
Sol Spiegelman and Norm Pace.

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:10.890
He then joined the department of
biochemistry and molecular biology

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:15.350
at Dalhousie in 1971 and
he's been there ever since.

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:19.790
He has won a Guggenheim Fellowship,
he's a member of the fellow,

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:22.160
a fellow of the Royal
Society of Canada,

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.350
a member of the National Academy
of Sciences, and on and on,

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:26.650
many distinguished honors.

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:32.760
And his research is on, has been on
the molecular genetics of microbes

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:36.020
and things like lateral
gene transfer instead

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:41.440
of hereditary transfer of
genetic material across species,

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:46.560
selfish DNA, gene structure,
particularly introns

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.550
about which I'm going
to say a little bit

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:50.060
in a moment, and the tree of life.

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:55.460
And one thing that's really quite
distinctive about this scientist is

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.670
that he, right now, has
two postdoctoral fellows

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:02.670
who are philosophers of science,
so he really bridges the sciences

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:06.560
and humanities which is something
that I find really appealing.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.920
George Fox is the Moores professor
of biochemistry and biology

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:15.520
at the University of Houston, he
got his PhD in chemical engineering

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:19.750
from Syracuse, he's the
co-discoverer with Carl Woese,

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:26.030
of the archaea, one of the three
fundamental domains of life

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:30.800
which really overturned the way
people thought life evolved.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:37.590
He is a fellow of the International
Astrobiological Society,

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:40.640
member of the American
Academy of Microbiology,

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:45.540
fellow of the American Academy
of the Association of Science,

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:50.260
and his research has been on
the evolution of the machinery

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:57.520 position:56%
of genetic translation, how
information moves from nucleic acids

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:01.260
into amino acids and forming
proteins that form the enzymes

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.230
and interesting structures
in the body.

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:07.950
Ray Gesteland is the
emeritus professor of biology

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:11.430
and the former vice president of
research at the University of Utah,

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:15.120
he 's a Howard Hughes
Medical Institute investigator,

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:21.490
his PhD was from Harvard where
he studied with James Watson.

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:24.480
He did postdoctoral work
in Geneva, Switzerland

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:29.550
and joined Cold Spring
Harbor Laboratory in 1967,

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:34.500
staying there until 1978 when he
joined the University of Utah.

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:40.260
With Ray White, he began a new and
now very distinguished Institute

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:47.690 position:56%
for Human Genetics, and since 1972,
he has collaborated with John Atkins

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:51.920
on the phenomenon of
genetic recoding.

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:58.400
He is the editor of the volume
"RNA World" so he wrote the book,

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:03.270
or at least edited it, and, which
is now in its fourth edition

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:06.510
so it's really the sort
of Bible of this field,

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:09.360
so it 's really a
delight to have him.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:15.020
And Walter Gilbert is the Carl
Loeb emeritus professor at Harvard,

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:20.520
he has a doctorate in physics
from the University of Cambridge,

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:24.570
and was appointed to the Harvard
physics department in 1959,

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:31.230
he then switched from physics to
biology and he ran a lab jointly

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:35.220
with James D. Watson of
the double helix fame.

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:44.690 position:56%
He won a Nobel Prize in chemistry in
1980 for the invention of a method

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:52.230
of DNA sequencing, and he's
a pioneer in biotechnology,

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:56.850 position:56%
he founded Biogen, one of the first
biotech companies, if not the first,

00:09:56.850 --> 00:10:00.890
he oversaw the development of a
number of groundbreaking products,

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:04.540
including alpha interferon
and hepatitis B vaccine,

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:09.990
and he also cofounded the
large biotechnology company,

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:11.890
Myriad Genetics.

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:17.810 position:56%
Other honors besides the Nobel Prize
include Louisa Gross Horwitz prize,

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:22.390
the Gairdner award from Canada, the
Lasker award, the National Academy

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:26.510
of Sciences, he is a foreign
member of the Royal Society,

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:29.650
British Royal Society,
and on and on.

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:33.440
His research has included the
identification of messenger RNA,

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:41.280
the lac repressor, a fundamental
component of the lactose gene

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:46.640
in bacteria model system,
pioneering work in recombinant DNA,

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:51.590
the first genetic engineering,
including the expression of insulin

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:55.750
in bacteria, he is a
founding, a pioneer member

00:10:55.750 --> 00:11:01.720
of the human genome project, and
he coined the term RNA world.

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:07.100 position:56%
So, it is an absolute thrill to have
these gentlemen here with me today

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:09.940
and to get into a conversation
with them.

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:14.500
And before we start that, I just
want to give a few remarks just

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:18.610 position:56%
to make sure we're all on the same
page, just introduce you to the idea

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:21.650
of the RNA world, alright?

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:27.380
So I can't see, oh here we are.

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:31.000
So what is the RNA world?

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:37.320
Well beginning in 1953,
James Watson, Francis Crick,

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:40.790
aided by Maurice Wilkins and
Rosalind Franklin, of course,

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:44.510
solved the double helical
structure of DNA.

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:48.540
Now the double helix, the shape

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:50.880
of the molecule usually
gets all the credit,

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:55.480
but the really interesting
thing about it is those bars

00:11:55.480 --> 00:12:00.090
on the ladder crossing the spiral
staircase because those are,

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:04.380
those symbolize the
nucleotide bases that pair up,

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:08.280
so it's really two half
spiral staircases, right,

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:13.890
each specifying another
nucleic acid and they realized

00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:20.650
that in the sequence of those bases
was genetic information, okay?

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:26.130
So it was in the DNA that
the information was held

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:28.080
for making proteins.

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:31.850
DNA information goes to
protein the A s, C s, G s,

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:35.930
and T s of DNA turns
into the amino acids

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:39.160
that are strung together
to form proteins.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:47.600 position:56%
Proteins are crucial molecules in
the cell, they do all sorts of work,

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:52.280
they are enzymes most importantly,
but they're also structural

00:12:52.280 --> 00:13:00.820 position:56%
and the basis of neuronal
transmission and structural elements

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:05.890
in the cell, and so forth, crucial,
crucial components of the cell.

00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:10.640
And in 1956, three years
after the double helix,

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:16.640 position:56%
Francis Crick coined what he
whimsically called the central dogma

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:21.500
of molecular biology and Watson
drew it out in this cartoon,

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:27.850
which says a number of things about
the flow of genetic information.

00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:29.600
This is really the first
time people began to think

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:33.120
about genetic information,
and the important thing

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:34.420
that most people remember

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:41.840
of the central dogma is this
simple phrase DNA makes RNA,

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:47.460
makes proteins, okay, so
what's DNA versus RNA?

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:49.490
They're very similar molecules,

00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:52.300
there are really only two
differences between them,

00:13:52.300 --> 00:14:00.540
one of the four bases is different,
RNA uses Uracil instead of Thymine,

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:06.200
and you'll see that there's on
the ring, there's one difference,

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:09.980
an OH instead of an H, those
are the only differences

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:13.910
between the two molecules but those
two slight differences make huge

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:15.770
differences in the chemistry,

00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:20.450
and DNA of course forms a
double-stranded molecule.

00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:25.720
RNA is usually single-stranded,
and that means it can bend around

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:29.860
and form into all kinds of
different shapes, alright?

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:32.330
It's also much more
reactive than DNA,

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:36.990
and those two facts become
important in the RNA world.

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:45.700
Okay. So the DNA makes RNA, makes
protein through two processes,

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:52.020
one called transcription where
an RNA molecule messenger RNA,

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:58.370
which Dr. Gilbert was a
key figure in identifying,

00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:03.590
and then that messenger RNA
is translated into a sequence

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:06.440
of amino acids that
makes a protein, okay?

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:10.230
And as I said, proteins
are ubiquitous in the cell,

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:12.990
they form hair, nails,
muscles, nerve cells,

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:15.770
and most importantly enzymes.

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:21.310
There are a couple of, and that
translation process is really sort

00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:25.240
of the heart of what we 're
going to be talking about today.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:28.950
Translation occurs in
structures called ribosomes,

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:31.980
so the messenger RNA
is read off the DNA,

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:38.280
and then it moves outside the
cell nucleus to the outer part

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:43.400
of the cell and in the ribosome
it is pulled through like a tape

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:51.070
through a tape recorder and it
is read off and the sequence

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:55.160
of those nucleotides specifies
the sequence of amino acids

00:15:55.160 --> 00:16:00.800
so this building chain of amino
acids then forms the protein.

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:03.150
Now you'll notice a
couple of things here,

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:08.080
one is that there is an
awful lot of RNA here,

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:11.150
you have the messenger
RNA, ribosomal RNA,

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:17.610 position:56%
the ribosome itself is made of RNA
mostly, and then, I've got one more,

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:22.790
and then transfer RNA is the
molecule that actually attaches

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:27.090
to the amino acid and brings
it to the building chain.

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:34.770
So there's a lot of RNA in
this part of the cell, okay?

00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:43.060
People very quickly began to
notice this fact and in 1962 one

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:48.440 position:56%
of the pioneers of molecular biology
Alex Rich gave a paper on the origin

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:51.910
of life so this was just nine
years after the double helix

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:53.720
and in fact was the
year that Watson, Crick,

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:58.260
and Wilkins won the Nobel Prize,
and he said the hypothetical stem

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:03.670
or parent nucleotide molecule
was initially an RNA-like polymer

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:06.340
which was able to convey
genetic information as well

00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:08.660
as organize the amino acids

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:12.240
into a specific sequence
to make proteins, okay?

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:20.460
So there's a, so RNA does most
of the work of that process.

00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:24.020
And in 1965, just 3 years later,

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:27.220
two other scientists made
similar realizations.

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:30.640
J. B. S. Haldane said that life,

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:33.820
by which he meant indefinite
replication of patterns

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:40.430
of large molecules, can be based on
RNA without DNA, and Fritz Lipmann

00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:47.850 position:56%
at the same conference said that
DNA probably evolved later than RNA,

00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:54.020 position:56%
so there was a time in which you had
RNA and proteins and not yet DNA.

00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:58.860
So back to this diagram here,
another thing that we can notice

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:04.520 position:56%
about this is that there are
enzymes or proteins involved in each

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:06.820 position:56%
of these processes, so none of this,

00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:10.420
although there are RNA molecules
involved, none of this can happen

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:13.990
without enzymes, without
proteins, alright.

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:16.100
So these things are
specifying proteins

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:18.120
and you need proteins to do it.

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:21.450
So that leads to a kind of
chicken and egg problem, alright,

00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:27.630
where you have genes that store
information, that encode proteins

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:31.120
that make enzymes and
you need those enzymes

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:35.450
to catalyze the reactions
to copy the genes.

00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:37.900
So how do you get out
of that problem?

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:43.290
The RNA world is the way you
get out of that problem, okay?

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:48.230 position:56%
And several people noticed this in
a speculative way in the late 1960s.

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:55.360 position:56%
Carl Woese said that proto-RNA could
have been, the proto-ribosomal RNA,

00:18:55.360 --> 00:19:02.500 position:56%
could have been the original genome,
and Francis Crick the next year said

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:05.680
that possibly the first
enzyme was an RNA molecule

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:11.180
with replicase properties, the
ability to copy other RNAs.

00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:16.030
Thus a system based mainly
on RNA is not impossible,

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:19.330
and the same year his
colleague Leslie Orgel said,

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:22.570
asked could polynucleotides of RNA

00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:26.140
with well-defined secondary
structures folding act

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:28.700
as primitive enzymes?

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:31.510
Could they be more than just
information storage molecules?

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:34.620
Could they actually
catalyze reactions too?

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:40.540
That would be a way out of
the chicken and egg problem.

00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:42.610
So the answer is yes!

00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:44.550
But hang on one second.

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:47.680
First I want to tell you about
a couple things that are going

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:48.980
to come up in the conversation.

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:54.200
One is the, as I mentioned earlier,
the discovery of the archaea,

00:19:54.200 --> 00:20:01.600
this brand-new group of single
celled organisms that George

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:09.650
and Carl Woese recognized through
sequencing RNA, ribosomal RNA,

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:16.170
were different from the bacteria,
and so this created a lot

00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:22.170
of discussion about how, what was
the original branching structure

00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:25.030
in the tree of life.

00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:32.430
And the same year, 1977 was a big
year for origin of life research.

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:36.540
Phil Sharp and his colleagues
at Yale and Rich Roberts

00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:41.760
at Cold Spring Harbor and his
colleagues independently discovered

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:44.870
that genes come in pieces.

00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:47.900
In higher organisms, eukaryotes,

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:51.590
organisms with a membrane-bound
nucleus

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:58.370
that contains the chromosomes, have
genes that can be segmented, okay,

00:20:58.370 --> 00:21:01.530
they can, and when you go
through the transcription

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:04.560
and translation process,
those middle bits

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:10.050 position:56%
between the segments get spliced out
and the segments join it together

00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:13.480
to form the final RNA that
gets read into the protein.

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:18.990
So that's really odd,
genes come in these pieces.

00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:24.420
Walter Gilbert wrote an article the
next year called Genes in Pieces

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:30.500
and in that paper he named those
segments exons, for the segments

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:35.050
that are part of the genes,
and introns as the segments

00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:42.630
between the exons, so they're
inter, in between the exons, okay.

00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:47.310
And he and Ford Doolittle
over the next few years got

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:54.260
in a lively discussion
about which came first,

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:57.770
when introns were invented
evolutionarily.

00:21:57.770 --> 00:21:59.790
Were they part of the
very first organisms

00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:03.470
or did they get invented later
as the eukaryotes evolved?

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:07.990
So this was a very
important discussion in origin

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:11.340
of life research that I want
to talk about more later.

00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:17.700
And then finally, the
discovery of RNA enzymes.

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:19.690
Crick and Orgel were right.

00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:27.550
RNA can act as an enzyme and that
was found first by Tom Cech and,

00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:33.760
in 1982, and then Sidney
Altman at Yale found

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:37.760
that a molecule called RNase
P that he'd been working

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:41.860
on for years also had, the RNA
also had catalytic properties.

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:47.680
So RNA can act as both a catalyst
and an information molecule.

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:52.190
So that breaks the chicken
and egg problem, alright?

00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:55.140
So this is kind of like the
old Saturday Night Live sketch

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:59.020
where you have the, you know,
the shimmer which is a floor wax

00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:02.410
and a dessert topping
all in one, right?

00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:05.430
The next, just a couple
of years later,

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:10.460
Walter Gilbert wrote an
article called The RNA World,

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:14.940
and this was the coining of the
term and we're going to talk more

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:16.450
about that I just want
put that up there

00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:18.700
so you have a sense
of the dates, okay.

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:26.040
In 1987, Cold Spring Harbor
held a meeting on RNA catalysis

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:31.550
that involved a lot of discussion
about the RNA world, and in 1993,

00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:37.230
Ray Gesteland and John
Atkins edited a volume of,

00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:42.120
a collection of papers called
the RNA world, and as I said,

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:47.050
it went through multiple editions
I forgot to put up the fourth.

00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:49.680
What year did the fourth
edition come out?

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:56.020
2011, okay, so this is still a very
vital and ongoing project, alright?

00:23:56.020 --> 00:24:00.050
So that is a quick
introduction to the RNA world.

00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:04.810 position:56%
Now I'm going to sit down, I'm going
to mostly turn it over to the them.

00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:06.900
Thank you.

00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:09.500
Okay just wave your
hands or something

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:10.800
if you can't hear or can't see.

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:14.190
I m trying to get out of the
way but I also want to make sure

00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:17.680
that I' m in conversation
with my guests here.

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:24.540
So, with that, let 's
begin with evolution.

00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:27.420
Theodosius Dobzhansky
famously said that nothing

00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:31.510
in biology makes sense except
in the light of evolution,

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:33.870
but the early generation

00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:36.830
of molecular biologists
were often criticized

00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:41.060
for not taking evolution
sufficiently seriously.

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:47.050
One of those critics, at least
in my reading, was Carl Woese.

00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:48.350
What do you think?

00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:50.500
Is that criticism fair?

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:55.210
To what extent did the RNA world
emerge from evolutionary thinking,

00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:59.720 position:56%
I mean from thought based on serious
reading of evolutionary literature.

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:01.900
&gt;&gt; Dr. Walter Gilbert:
I thought that,

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:05.080
I think it 's an unfortunate
question.

00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:10.040
I do agree the early generation
of molecular biologists did not,

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:12.770 position:56%
most part didn't think of evolution.

00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:19.050
The discovery of the DNA sequencing
in 76, discovery of DNA sequencing

00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:24.840
in 76 suddenly made it possible to
look at the genes of many organisms

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:26.640
and one of the first
things that happened

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:30.400
as molecular biologists did this
was they discovered that the genes

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:33.640
in [inaudible] were like the genes
in plants and stuff like that

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:37.540
and suddenly evolution
swept the field.

00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:39.780
I remember going to a conference
in which in fact this sort

00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:44.130
of suddenly became a fantastic
element in people's thinking.

00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:49.670
Those of us who had a slightly
more genetic background were more

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:53.060
conscious of evolution,
but the general field

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:57.740
of molecular biology was not.

00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:01.880
I think the RNA world
image is deeply based

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:05.260
in a notion of evolution.

00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:11.160
The point of the paper that
I wrote in 1986 was twofold.

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:16.900
One, it picked up from
arguments that had been made,

00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:22.530
I would say picked up from the
discovery of the RNA enzymes

00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:26.920
that had been made and reiterated
just before that and had picked

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:31.550
up from an older notion
from the biochemists

00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:37.230
that RNA was more primary than DNA,
and the biochemistry of that is

00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:41.630
that all of the DNA structures,
the DNA sugars and the DNA,

00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:47.070
of the DNA bases and nucleotides,
are made from RNA precursors.

00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:52.300
So if you look at the biochemistry,
you would not say DNA is separate

00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:55.090
in any way or primary in any
way, you would say, oh,

00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:57.290
the chemistry suggests
that RNA is the thing

00:26:57.290 --> 00:27:02.320 position:56%
that you made biochemically and from
that you would later make DNA.

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:07.420
People knowing that thought
of a RNA protein world.

00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:13.110
RNA is a genetic material,
machines in the organism,

00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:16.490
and that genetic material can
be used to dictate the sequence

00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:20.750 position:56%
of amino acids and amino acids were
thought of as the interesting things

00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:22.680
in the world, the enzymes.

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:27.390
And the protein chemists ignored
the nucleic acids intensely,

00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:31.240
they thought everything interesting
in the world was in the proteins.

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:32.940
It makes very interesting meetings

00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:35.090
in which the protein
chemists meet separately

00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:37.630
and the nucleic acid chemists
meet separately and they never

00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:38.930
like to talk to each other

00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:42.710
or the protein chemists
totally ignore nucleic acids.

00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:46.690 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort: Nobody could
translate between the two languages.

00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:51.580
&gt;&gt; Dr. Walter Gilbert: But the
discovery of the enzymatic activity

00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:57.450
of RNA made me think that
maybe RNA could be entirely,

00:27:57.450 --> 00:28:00.420
play the role of all of the
enzymes and so the paper I wrote

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:03.990 position:56%
in 86 makes actually two statements.

00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:08.750
One, it suggests maybe RNA
enzymes could in fact do all

00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:14.640 position:56%
of the necessary activities for a
cell to exist, including the copying

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:20.050 position:56%
of RNA itself, and therefore you
could imagine evolution is beginning

00:28:20.050 --> 00:28:26.330
with a small RNA molecule that
develops by random structures,

00:28:26.330 --> 00:28:31.830
random association of bases,
the ability to copy itself,

00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:36.230
and once it can copy itself, it
can make more, makes more copies,

00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:40.270
but in fact since it' s a
biological process, it makes copies

00:28:40.270 --> 00:28:44.300
which would also have
errors and so it can evolve.

00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:47.790 position:56%
It can make random changes and those
random changes can be acted upon

00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:53.060
by natural selection to eventually
produce better molecules.

00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:58.460 position:56%
Second part of that essay,
however, points out that because one

00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:02.760
of the RNA enzymes that was then
known at that time was an intron,

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:07.440
the region inside an RNA molecule,
it could splice itself out.

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:13.850
I could make the argument that that
activity clearly could be used,

00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:19.020
not only to splice introns out
of the RNA, but by combining two

00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:22.830 position:56%
of those structures, develop a
structure that can move an RNA piece

00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:25.680
around from one molecule
to the other,

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:29.890
inserting it like a transposon,
splicing out the rest,

00:29:29.890 --> 00:29:33.040
and creating a novel
RNA combination,

00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:35.920
and that's a very powerful
evolutionary tool,

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:38.870
we call it recombination
when it occurs at DNA level,

00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:41.900
but in fact here was a model
that clearly could happen

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:44.690
at the RNA level, and
so I could immediately

00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:46.850
in that paper suggest two things.

00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:51.350
Maybe there could be RNA-based
organism, completely using RNA

00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:54.870
as enzymes, and the evolutionary
processes would be able

00:29:54.870 --> 00:30:00.040
to shuffle the pieces of RNA
around to make novel pieces again.

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:04.830
The original intron, exon idea you
alluded to, the critical element

00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:07.850
of that idea was an
evolutionary argument,

00:30:07.850 --> 00:30:11.720
it was not just the
biochemical argument that you had

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:16.450
on the DNA long regions that we
call introns that are spliced

00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:20.160
out of the RNA molecule
to produce small pieces,

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:22.110
together they code
for pieces of protein.

00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:24.330
But the evolutionary argument is

00:30:24.330 --> 00:30:27.260
that by spreading those
regions apart from the DNA,

00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:31.360 position:56%
you would increase the recombination
rates between those regions

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:35.830
and hence you could more
rapidly create protein structures

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:40.330
and evolve them to better
function by recombination

00:30:40.330 --> 00:30:42.820
and by shuffling the
pieces of the protein.

00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:47.010
So in fact both the intron, exon
idea is conditioned by a vision

00:30:47.010 --> 00:30:50.650
of evolution and the RNA
world idea is also conditioned

00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:52.490
by that vision of evolution.

00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:57.970
That paper in fact finally includes
that sort of a hidden definition

00:30:57.970 --> 00:31:03.160
of life as that thing which
can by replication, mutation,

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:08.420
and recombination as by changing
random changes can evolve

00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:11.290
and thus can be operated
upon by natural selection

00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:13.920
to reduce ever better functioning.

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:15.460
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort:
Okay, thank you.

00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:18.180
I think that was a very
fortunate question in that case.

00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:20.390
I can now throw away
half of my questions

00:31:20.390 --> 00:31:24.760 position:56%
but [laughter] Ford I think you
might have something to say on this.

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:26.080 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dr. W. Ford Doolittle: Yeah well,

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:29.750
I think your initial question
involved the phrase serious

00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:31.860
reading of the evolutionary
literature or something like that

00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:35.020
and I think most molecular
biologists did not seriously read

00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:39.780
the evolutionary literature,
probably still don t.

00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:42.730
Mostly evolution is something you
talk about in the last paragraph

00:31:42.730 --> 00:31:46.640
of the paper and I think, and
over a few beers kind of thing

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:50.480
because I think there was a general
feeling amongst the molecular

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:52.970
biological community that
evolution obviously was important

00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:54.950
but also there is nothing
you can really say about it

00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:56.440
so you could just say
whatever you wanted

00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:58.980
and everybody would
accept that politely.

00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:00.280
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort:
I think that s right.

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:01.580
&gt;&gt; Dr. W. Ford Doolittle:
I think you were right

00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:08.330
that 1977 was a very important
year for some of us and I want

00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:12.570 position:56%
to go back a little bit about the
intron relationship to the RNA world

00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:18.290
because I wasn't always lab
on sabbatical at that time

00:32:18.290 --> 00:32:21.380
and [inaudible] came back
from Switzerland, I think,

00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:24.570
having heard for the first
time about the introns

00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:28.570
in the immunoglobulin
genes, I believe, and gave,

00:32:28.570 --> 00:32:31.060
there were live meetings
once a week in all these labs

00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:33.300
with very strong tea as I recall.

00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:36.840
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort: Why tea
and not something stronger?

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:40.660
&gt;&gt; Dr. W. Ford Doolittle: And while
we presented the exon shuffling

00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:45.350
idea, which I thought was
a brilliant way for things

00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:48.750
to evolve more rapidly in the
way that he just described,

00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:53.700 position:56%
but I had one concern about that
which was I believe thinking the way

00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:56.590
that most of people, for most
people thought in those days,

00:32:56.590 --> 00:32:59.460
we imagined that higher
cells, eukaryotes, animals

00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:04.620
and plants evolved from bacteria
and bacteria don't have introns

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:10.770 position:56%
and eukaryotes, higher cells do have
introns and so that sort of implied

00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:13.270
that these relative event
cells would suddenly take

00:33:13.270 --> 00:33:16.100
on these interruptions in all
their genes just so that they can

00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:18.550
in the future do a better job
of evolving and which seem,

00:33:18.550 --> 00:33:22.680
not something could, anybody who
have done any serious reading

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:25.940
on evolutionary literature would
be willing to accept is possible.

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:27.790
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort:
You're not quite fair.

00:33:27.790 --> 00:33:29.280
&gt;&gt; Dr. W. Ford Doolittle:
I'm not blaming you for that.

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:33.560
&gt;&gt; Dr. Walter Gilbert: I was going
at large, at that moment we knew

00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:39.190
of introns only in more complicated
genes, and so the first suggestion,

00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:42.940
I learned about the introns
and exons from the people

00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:48.740
who discovered the splicing in
the Cold Spring Harbor meeting

00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:51.400
in probably May or June that year

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:55.890
and in my laboratory we had a
sequence of an immunoglobulin gene

00:33:55.890 --> 00:33:58.150
which actually had an intron
and we just sequenced it.

00:33:58.150 --> 00:34:01.410
We didn't actually know what
that was, but it was an intron.

00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:04.840 position:56%
So when I came back from Switzerland
having thought about these ideas,

00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:10.680 position:56%
I suggested that eukaryotes uniquely
use the greater evolutionary speed

00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:16.390
of recombination within introns
to reduce the great explosion,

00:34:16.390 --> 00:34:18.510
pre-cambrian explosion
of the eukaryotic genes,

00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:20.140
and that' s the background.

00:34:20.140 --> 00:34:22.260
&gt;&gt; Dr. W. Ford Doolittle: And
that s what I objected to.

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:23.560
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort: Right.

00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:25.910
&gt;&gt; Dr. W. Ford Doolittle:
Because of, if we believe,

00:34:25.910 --> 00:34:29.300
which I think 99 percent of the
people believed at that time

00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:31.460
that eukaryotes came
from prokaryotes,

00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:34.770
then they would have had to
take on the burden of introns

00:34:34.770 --> 00:34:38.170
and ten introns on average
on every gene in order

00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:40.980
that several million years
down the road they 'd be able

00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:44.580
to do these wonderful
evolutionary things which seem kind

00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:47.710
of anticipatory and
not the kind of thing,

00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:52.120 position:56%
evolution really can't look ahead
so that was my reaction to what you,

00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:54.580
and I don't think you
actually implied that

00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:56.520
but that' s my reaction.

00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:59.120
And I also happen to be privileged
because I had worked on [inaudible]

00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:01.400
and I knew Carl Woese and
I knew George and I knew

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:05.810
about this almost simultaneous
publication

00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:08.920
of the three the main
view of life that George

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:12.880
and Carl Woese had been working
on that, in their view, eukaryotes

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:15.250
and prokaryotes were not
evolved, I mean it wasn't

00:35:15.250 --> 00:35:17.560
that eukaryotes evolved
from within the prokaryotes,

00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:21.380
they evolved separately from some
more primitive ancestral form,

00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:25.910 position:56%
so then I thought, well actually
went home and had a bottle of scotch

00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:32.050
and wrote overnight that piece
and I thought that, you know,

00:35:32.050 --> 00:35:34.340
it'd make more sense if
introns were actually present

00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:36.250
from the very beginning.

00:35:36.250 --> 00:35:42.080
And then as evolution proceeded,
prokaryotes lost all the introns

00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:43.380
but eukaryotes retained them

00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:47.510
and this gave them the evolutionary
ability to become complex organisms

00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:50.540
like ourselves and
prokaryotes have'n t done

00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:52.700
that although they've done a
lot of other wonderful things

00:35:52.700 --> 00:36:06.960
and they've gotten much more
streamlined, we use the word.

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:15.180
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort:
Streamlining, yes.

00:36:15.180 --> 01:57:37.590
&gt;&gt; Dr. W. Ford Doolittle:
