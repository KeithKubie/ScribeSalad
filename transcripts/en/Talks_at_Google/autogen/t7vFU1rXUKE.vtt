[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.047 --> 00:00:07.630
DAVANG SHAH: I have
the great pleasure

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:09.880
of introducing a
friend as well as

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.680
one of the most
prominent figures

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.660
in the community, Soojin Kwon.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.570
Soojin is the managing
director of the MBA admissions

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.520
and the overall program
at Michigan's Ross

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.690
School of Business.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.570
She's also an adjunct lecturer
in business communications

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:23.500
at Ross.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.690
Previous in her
life, she was also

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:27.540
a manager at
Deloitte consulting,

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.190
an analyst with the US
Senate Budget Committee,

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:33.220
and a Presidential Management
Fellow with the White House

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.980
Appropriations Committee
and Department of Commerce.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.260
She holds an MBA
from Ross, a Master's

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.230
in Public Policy from Harvard's
Kennedy School of Government,

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.290
and a BA in Economics and
Political Science from Yale.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.450
She's clearly not
very accomplished.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.640
We're thrilled to
have Soojin here

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.540
to share perspective on her
career, her path, and then

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.390
a little bit about what's
happening in the MBA world

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:56.060
for all of you.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.540
So Soojin, welcome, and
thank you for coming.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.448
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:03.448 --> 00:01:04.989
SOOJIN KWON: Thank
you for having me.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.600
When Devan and Angel asked me
to do this, I was thrilled.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.370
And the context they
gave me was there

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:11.986
are a lot of Googlers
out there who

00:01:11.986 --> 00:01:14.610
are interested in thinking about
the next step in their career,

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.040
and we thought it
might be useful

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.000
for you to share your own path.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.610
And so I'm going
to start from way

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.310
back, from when I was a
child and when all of us

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.750
start to think
about, what do you

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.170
want to do when you grow up?

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.170
How many of you have
thought about that question

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.170
since childhood?

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.750
So what I was really young
before I went to grade school,

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.790
I thought, I want
to be a cashier

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.980
because I thought you got
to take home all the money

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.474
that you collected at
the end of the day.

00:01:39.474 --> 00:01:40.890
And then I got a
little bit older.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.500
I got a little bit wiser.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.390
And I saw my parents
working really hard.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.510
My parents are
immigrants from Korea.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.510
And my dad was an
engineer, and my mom

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.810
worked at nights fixing
phones so she could be home

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.660
while we were home from school.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.132
And they were constantly
working and taking care of us

00:01:59.132 --> 00:01:59.840
around the clock.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.195
And I thought,
wow, that is hard.

00:02:02.195 --> 00:02:05.820
All I want to do when
I grow up is retire.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.509
My parents said, no,
you've got to first work.

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.890
So then, as I went through
grade school and middle school,

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.890
I was one of a
handful of Asian kids

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.760
in a very white community right
outside of Ann Arbor actually.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.000
And I grew up with a lot
of physical and personal

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.210
challenges to who I was
because of how I looked.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.320
And right or wrong,
I happened to watch

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.380
the movie "The Godfather"
with my dad when I was young.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.450
And I thought, when
I grow up, I want

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.390
to be the Godfather because
you can say take a hit out

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.160
on that person.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.360
They've crossed me.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.010
And my parents said
Soojin, no, that's

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.660
not the way to get ahead.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.930
So then, when I got to
high school, what I saw

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.080
was still my parents
working really hard

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.370
and trying to make ends meet.

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.154
And our ends met,
but we had things

00:02:55.154 --> 00:02:57.320
that we needed, not always
the things that I wanted.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.790
And I thought, what I want--

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.920
back to my childhood-- is money.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.400
I need to go work in business.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.170
So I also grew up playing the
piano quite well a long time

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.670
ago.

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.270
And I had a decision to make
when I got into college.

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.550
I had gotten into
Michigan for music

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.370
and gotten a scholarship
to study music,

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:17.840
but I also got into Yale--

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.760
not for music, but for a
liberal arts education.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.650
And I chose the
win-win solution,

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.340
which was to go to Yale
because my parents are Asian.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.730
They have a desire to
have bragging rights.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.730
And Yale gave them bragging
rights with all their friends

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.130
that we grew up with.

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.830
And for me, it was a
ticket out of Michigan

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.670
and a ticket to seeing
more of the world,

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.520
learning with other people
who are were from Michigan.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.690
And that really appealed to me.

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.290
So I thought,
finally, I'll be free.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.606
I can do whatever I want to do
except that my parents said,

00:03:54.606 --> 00:03:57.230
well, you've got to do something
that's going to get you a job.

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.021
And the thing that's
going to get you a job

00:03:59.021 --> 00:04:02.330
is a degree that's going to
lead to either another degree

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:03.680
or business.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.980
So you're either going to
do pre-med or engineering

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.160
or pre-law, something like that.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.990
I didn't want to do
any of those things.

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.210
But they said, if you want us
to pay for college or at least

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:16.668
part of it, you're going to
have to major in something that

00:04:16.668 --> 00:04:17.630
gets you a job.

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.769
So my compromise was economics
and political science.

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.630
I thought that's
going to set me up

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.280
to potentially
apply to law school

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.400
because that will lead to
a profession, something

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.480
that my parents could say Soojin
is now a lawyer or a doctor

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.290
or engineer.

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.810
So it was something very clear.

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.670
And it was something
that was familiar.

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:41.150
It's something that I
learned about on TV.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.040
Back then, before
there was Google,

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.500
back before there was
internet and LinkedIn,

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.500
the only way you could know
what career paths were available

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.900
were by the people around you--

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.800
your parents, their family
and friends, and things

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.360
you saw on TV.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.880
So to give you another example,
my husband is a dentist.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.720
And he knew he wanted to be
a dentist from a young age

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.830
because he saw the show "Rudolph
the Red-Nosed Reindeer."

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.180
how could that have led to
wanting to be a dentist?

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:11.430
There is a character on there.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:12.846
How many of you
have seen "Rudolph

00:05:12.846 --> 00:05:13.890
the Red-Nosed Reindeer?"

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:14.390
OK.

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:15.830
So there are a bunch of elves.

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.730
And there's one elf, Hermey, who
says, "I want to be a dentist."

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:22.760
And the head elf says
no, you're a toy maker.

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.030
But I'm really interested
in molars and things.

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:29.390
And so when he saw that,
my husband Jim said,

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.529
I want to do something that
makes me different, too.

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:34.070
The other thing that
made him realize

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.040
he wanted to be a
dentist was, growing up,

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.140
he had gone to his
dentist and he was always

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:40.230
singing and whistling.

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:41.480
And this guy was always happy.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.030
And he thought,
when I grow up, I

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:44.540
want a career where
I'm really happy

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.350
and fulfilled in my career.

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.360
So that's what I want to do.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.140
Even though we ended up in very
different places, what drove us

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:54.650
to our decision was that we
were influenced by the things

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:58.850
that we knew, the people around
us, what we were exposed to.

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.660
And back before the internet,
it was really limited.

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.670
So most people followed in
the footsteps of their parents

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:08.640
or their parents' friends.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:12.210
So fast forward to college
and my senior year at Yale.

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:14.210
I had to decide what
am I going to do next.

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:15.960
The obvious thing was
to go to law school.

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.440
So to make my parents happy
and be a good Asian kid,

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.090
I did apply to law school.

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:22.980
But what I really wanted
to do after taking

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:25.320
a constitutional
law class was work

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.290
on policies that would impact
a lot of people for the greater

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:29.520
good.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.410
And I discovered in
the career office

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:33.980
at Yale, public policy school.

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:35.940
And so I sent away for
information for that,

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.880
not telling my parents
that I was doing that.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.830
And I got in.

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:42.600
And when it came time
to make a decision,

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.680
my parents said, what the heck
is this thing called an MPP?

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.690
What are you going to
do when you grow up

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:49.920
after getting that degree?

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.425
Does it lead to a job, and
how much will you make?

00:06:52.425 --> 00:06:53.800
I was like, I don't know.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.407
I'm just going to take it on
faith that it will work out.

00:06:57.407 --> 00:06:57.990
And so it did.

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:59.160
I did get a job.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.530
I became a Presidential
Management Fellow.

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:03.570
And what that program
does is it gives you

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:06.240
leadership training as well
as rotational opportunities

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.300
throughout the executive
and legislative branches.

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.970
And that's what I did
for a number of years.

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:15.060
And it was great fun to
be in the middle of what

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.222
was making news.

00:07:16.222 --> 00:07:17.180
It's still making news.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.860
Stuff that happens
in DC makes the news.

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.060
It felt exciting.

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:21.955
It felt current.

00:07:21.955 --> 00:07:23.520
It felt sexy.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.220
Until I realized, I
am just one little cog

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:29.940
in this big machine that isn't
having an impact on things

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:32.070
that really change the world.

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:34.800
And so I felt pretty
useless, and I thought,

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.890
I need to do something else
because my heart isn't really

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:38.670
in it.

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:40.530
It was in it for
the right reasons,

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:44.340
but I wasn't feeling like
I could have that impact.

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:47.250
So the next step
was private sector.

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:51.120
At least there I can feel like
I'm working on something where

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.820
I can impact change
pretty quickly, where

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:57.270
I can see the results of
my brain power, my effort,

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:59.820
my working with other people.

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:02.460
So I said, consulting,
that's the thing for me.

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:04.730
It will allow me to
use my brain power.

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:07.320
It will allow me to work
with different people, work

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:08.400
on different projects.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.660
It will be exciting.

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:10.860
It will be sexy.

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:14.080
We're all in search of
sexy to some extent.

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.410
So I threw a bunch
of letters out there,

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:19.560
cover letters to all the
top consulting firms.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:20.940
I got nothing.

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:23.940
I thought, I have a Yale
degree and a Harvard degree.

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:26.430
Surely, that's going
to get me a job.

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:27.640
Guess what?

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:28.410
It doesn't.

00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:29.850
It didn't.

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:32.850
Because I didn't know how to
apply for a job like that.

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:34.891
I didn't really
know what it was.

00:08:34.891 --> 00:08:36.390
I didn't know how
to talk about what

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:38.070
I would bring to the table.

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:40.919
I didn't know how to talk
about their organizations.

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:44.610
I hadn't done my homework, and
I didn't really know myself.

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:46.470
So I went back to
the drawing board.

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:47.880
The answer is always school.

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.530
When you don't know
what to do next,

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:52.120
school is always a good thing.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.720
So I decided to get
my MBA because I still

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:57.510
had it in my mind that I
wanted to do consulting.

00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:59.790
I went to the Michigan
Ross School of Business

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:03.240
right here in Ann Arbor and
spent the next two years

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.100
doing things that
would set me up

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:07.710
to be able to get
a consulting job.

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:08.970
And I did.

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:12.490
I landed a job at
Deloitte Consulting,

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:15.866
and I did that for
about five years.

00:09:15.866 --> 00:09:18.240
And it gave me some of the
things that I was looking for,

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.630
which was using my brain
power to make change

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:24.755
in an organization
that I could see.

00:09:24.755 --> 00:09:26.880
But after a number of years
of doing that, again, I

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:29.520
felt my heart saying,
I need something more.

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:33.210
So I had to think about, what is
that more that I'm looking for?

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:36.027
And that more was
personal meaning,

00:09:36.027 --> 00:09:37.860
where I'm having an
impact on something that

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:41.130
makes somebody else's life
better, where it's getting

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:43.960
someone more opportunities.

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:48.190
That's about all I knew about
what I wanted to do next.

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:49.680
And so I had to
really think about,

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:53.040
what are the jobs out there that
can give me that, where I can

00:09:53.040 --> 00:10:00.390
use my skills and get the
feeling that I want in my gut,

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:03.480
in my soul about having impact?

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.850
So I just started talking
to a lot of people, people

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:07.770
who do different things
in their careers,

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:11.820
and learning what do they
do, what is it all about.

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.980
And as it turns out,
one of my conversations

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:15.510
was with the woman
who had recruited

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:17.430
me to come work at Deloitte.

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:18.700
She was a manager at the time.

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:21.600
And as soon as I took the offer,
she said, guess what, Soojin?

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.260
I'm leaving.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:24.360
I'm so glad you signed.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.740
You made me look good, but I'm
going to go do something else.

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:27.840
I was like, what the heck?

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.060
I joined because I
wanted to work with you.

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:33.000
As it turned out, she went to
go see the admissions director

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.819
at the Ross School of Business.

00:10:34.819 --> 00:10:37.110
And over the next five years
that I worked at Deloitte,

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:38.970
I kept in touch with her.

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:41.280
And having those
conversations with her

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:46.650
helped lead me to my current job
at the Ross School of Business.

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:49.240
We talked about,
what do I like doing?

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.790
What is it about
some of the roles

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:54.569
that I've had that really
excited me, brought me joy,

00:10:54.569 --> 00:10:56.610
made me feel like I was
having the kind of impact

00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:58.200
that I wanted?

00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.560
And it was a number of things.

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:03.760
One was, in my free time,
I am an alumni interviewer

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.305
for Yale undergrad.

00:11:05.305 --> 00:11:06.930
And one of the things
I love about that

00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:08.490
is understanding people--

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:11.700
what motivates them,
their dreams, and is there

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:15.300
a good fit between what they
want to do, what they've done,

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:18.150
and what that school can offer.

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:20.080
So that was one thing.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.620
Another thing I realized
was, at Deloitte, I really

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:26.490
enjoyed recruiting
new MBAs because it

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:29.340
was an avenue to opportunities.

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:33.870
It was promoting an organization
that I really loved.

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:37.290
And then, I also liked
using my analytical skills

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:39.480
in consulting,
figuring out how do

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:43.120
I make something work better,
how do I get more of something,

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.870
how do I make it as good
a process and experience

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:48.960
for people who engage
with my organization--

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:52.200
whether it's Deloitte
or Yale or Michigan.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:54.237
How do I make those
things happen?

00:11:54.237 --> 00:11:56.070
And so when I described
these things to her,

00:11:56.070 --> 00:12:00.690
it became obvious to her and to
me that recruiting at Michigan

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:02.220
might be a good fit.

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:04.950
And opportunity happened
to present itself.

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:06.780
She had an open slot there.

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:10.140
That's how I got
here 13 years ago,

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:12.990
and I haven't looked back
because the things that

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:15.930
keep me here are some
of the same things I

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:18.300
was looking for in a job--

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:21.850
feeling like I have an impact
on people's lives and that help

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:25.650
them have better opportunities
in their own lives,

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:27.390
getting to use my
analytical skills--

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:30.450
the things that I learned
in the MBA program--

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:32.280
and working in an
organization that I feel

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:36.000
is mission driven and
helps other people

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.800
and is doing really
exciting things.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.710
It's sexy to work on
leadership and innovation

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:42.540
and entrepreneurship
and all those things,

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:44.920
and I'm surrounded
by faculty, students,

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:47.320
and alumni who do that.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:49.680
And so when people
ask me, what's next?

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:53.700
I say, why should there be a
what's next if I'm learning

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:56.490
and I'm growing and
I love what I do.

00:12:56.490 --> 00:12:59.250
Because ultimately, isn't
that what we're looking for?

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:01.530
At least one of
those three things.

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:03.540
But if you have all
three of those things,

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:06.630
you kind of have that trifecta.

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:09.510
So as I think about
advice to people

00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:11.710
who are early in
their career, how

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:16.380
can you find the thing that
will make your heart sing,

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:18.400
I have a few things.

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:21.990
One is to research and explore.

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:24.000
Really, talk to a lot of people.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.060
Every person that
you meet is going

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:29.580
to be able to teach
you something.

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:34.110
I met Devan maybe seven, eight
years ago not professionally

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:35.677
but through an alumni event.

00:13:35.677 --> 00:13:37.260
DAVANG SHAH: We were
planting flowers.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:38.968
SOOJIN KWON: We planted
flowers together.

00:13:38.968 --> 00:13:41.340
He and his wife in
downtown Ann Arbor,

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:43.420
we were all doing
volunteer work that day.

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:45.380
And we happened to
develop a relationship

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:49.730
that, over the last seven years,
I've watched him have two kids.

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:51.060
He's seen my kids grow up.

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:54.090
I'm here now largely
because of him.

00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:56.760
And meeting Angel-- are
you still in here, Angel?

00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:00.630
I met her at Devan's house,
and we had a great conversation

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:03.390
about some of the things that
she did in undergrad that I

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:05.100
was really inspired about--

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:08.790
her initiative and her drive
for creating a TED Talk

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:11.550
series at her institution.

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:15.390
I was really excited to
hear things that people do,

00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:19.480
and it makes me want to know
them and know other people.

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.900
The other thing,
second thing, is

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:25.140
to reflect on what's
important to you

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:27.340
and where you are in your life.

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:29.910
What's right for you
really depends on where

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:32.310
you are in your stage of life.

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:33.870
Who's in your life?

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:35.580
Who do you need to take care of?

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:38.160
Do you have a significant other?

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:39.630
Do you have children?

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:42.390
Do you have parents who
need to be taken care of?

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:45.510
Or can you, right now,
focus on yourself?

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:48.770
That should influence the
choices that you make.

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:51.900
And the other thing is, what
do you need to do in your life

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:53.250
right now?

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:55.410
Do you have a lot of
other obligations?

00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:58.260
Do you have personal goals
that you want to fit in?

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:01.710
Or, can you really
focus on career?

00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:04.230
Those things can
help you figure out

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:06.612
what is the next career for me.

00:15:06.612 --> 00:15:08.320
Because, at different
times in your life,

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:11.250
those things are
going to change.

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:14.580
And the last thing I
would encourage you to do

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:17.550
is to stop and reflect.

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:20.820
Reflect on, what have I
done so far in my life?

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:23.100
What have I learned?

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:25.130
With the people
that I've talked to,

00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:26.640
what seems really interesting?

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:27.690
How did they get there?

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:31.810
What can I learn from them
or about how to get there?

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:33.690
And if you don't
do this already,

00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:35.950
I would encourage you
to keep a journal.

00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:37.180
And I know it can be hard.

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:38.350
I find it hard myself.

00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:43.100
But keep a journal of the things
that you learn about yourself,

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:45.900
of the things that
were hard, how

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:48.060
you've tackled some of
those problems, things

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:52.080
you want to change about how you
might approach something, goals

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:55.530
that you have, but taking
quiet time to sit down

00:15:55.530 --> 00:15:57.810
and reflect about those things.

00:15:57.810 --> 00:16:02.750
That can help you also narrow
down what it is you want to do.

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:06.110
You guys are really lucky that
you work in a great place,

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:08.630
that you live in a time when
you can find out information

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:12.950
about anything about anyone
anywhere in the world,

00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:14.540
and you can connect with them.

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:17.150
You are only a few
degrees of separation

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:20.330
away from someone
who may want to meet.

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:22.340
In some ways, that
might be harder

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:24.980
because that makes
it seem overwhelming,

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:27.740
all those opportunities
that you could have.

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:31.730
But if you do those three
things that I suggested--

00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:34.400
research and talk to
people, think about

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:36.670
where you are in
your life right now,

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:39.230
and sitting down and reflecting
on what's important to you,

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:42.200
what you've done, and
who you want to be--

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:45.920
that can help narrow
your focus a bit.

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:48.890
One of the most exciting things
about meeting new people for me

00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:52.760
is thinking about new ways of
doing things and new things

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:54.890
to do.

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:58.010
And some people may
call that networking.

00:16:58.010 --> 00:16:59.750
I really call it
getting to know people.

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:02.350
It's a really valuable skill.

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:05.089
And I have to put in a plug,
of course, for getting an MBA.

00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:06.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:08.089
And here's why.

00:17:08.089 --> 00:17:12.440
Because I will contend that,
more than any other degree,

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:16.849
that's going to open up a
broader range of opportunities.

00:17:16.849 --> 00:17:19.609
It can be opportunities
financially,

00:17:19.609 --> 00:17:24.530
opportunities industry
function-wise, opportunities

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:27.390
to meet different people.

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:31.700
If you are a dentist or
a doctor or an attorney,

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:33.710
your career is that.

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:38.040
It will be almost invariably
that for the rest of your life.

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:40.370
But when you get
an MBA, there's so

00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:43.010
many things you can
do that may or may not

00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:44.600
be related to business.

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:47.900
What it teaches you are
ways to think about things,

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.910
problem solve, and to
work with other people.

00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:54.100
And that's what we're going
to have to do in any field.

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:57.860
And so I contend that an MBA
is the most valuable degree,

00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:01.280
the most flexible degree
you can have out there.

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:04.970
And if you're going to do one,
you should get it at Michigan.

00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:08.759
I'll stop there and
turn it over to Devan.

00:18:08.759 --> 00:18:10.550
DAVANG SHAH: Well,
first of all, thank you.

00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:13.940
It's incredibly insightful
to hear about your journey,

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:17.304
more insightful to hear about
how you've made decisions

00:18:17.304 --> 00:18:18.470
at every stage in your life.

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:20.095
I'll start with a
handful of questions.

00:18:20.095 --> 00:18:21.590
And as I'm asking
questions, I'll

00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:23.480
ask all the folks in
the room to also start

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:25.562
thinking about questions
or jotting them down.

00:18:25.562 --> 00:18:27.770
But let's start, one of the
things that really struck

00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:31.880
me is how you made decisions
at every stage in your life

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:35.060
based on a little bit of
something that felt uneasy,

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:36.740
something in your
gut, something that

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:39.320
meant that you needed to
think about this itch that

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:42.260
was kind of happening and
a change that you needed.

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:44.840
So I'd love for you to
talk about how you thought

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:46.760
about those decisions
and then, ultimately,

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:47.900
any sort of guidance.

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:50.240
A lot of the folks in
this room are either

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:53.151
in their first job or their
second job out of school

00:18:53.151 --> 00:18:55.400
and will soon be coming to
those points of inflection,

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.664
so any guidance you can
provide there would be useful.

00:18:57.664 --> 00:18:59.582
SOOJIN KWON: OK.

00:18:59.582 --> 00:19:01.040
So there were many
things that made

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.440
making these decisions
challenging for me

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:04.860
along the way.

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:08.840
Part of it is my own
culture and heritage--

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:11.540
being Asian, obviously--
wanting to please my parents

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:12.470
and make them proud.

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:17.420
That is something that, even
now as I'm approaching 50,

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:21.030
it looms really large in my
head the decisions that I make.

00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:23.120
And so what I
wanted to do wasn't

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:25.680
always what they
wanted me to do,

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:29.030
and reconciling that
was really hard.

00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:34.400
The other was reconciling
kind of my background

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:35.900
and what I want to do.

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:38.780
Is this the career
path of someone

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:41.510
who went to Yale and Harvard?

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:43.160
To be an admissions director?

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:45.830
Who grows up wanting to do that?

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:49.010
Getting an MBA and then being an
admissions director eventually?

00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:50.750
Who grows up wanting to do that?

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:54.530
So it felt like a very
nontraditional, unconventional

00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:56.300
decision to make.

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:59.410
And I'll be honest, I
have a lot of pride.

00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:02.840
Like, I want people to say,
wow, she's done something

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:04.740
really great with her life.

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:06.860
She is accomplishing a lot.

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:09.500
And given the path
that I was on,

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:12.360
it wasn't always clear
to me that the choice

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:17.750
that I've made in this
role was an obvious one.

00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:21.530
It takes a lot of courage
to say, but you know what?

00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:23.210
I love this.

00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:24.830
I'm learning.

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:25.970
I'm contributing.

00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:27.500
I'm making an impact.

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:29.280
I can make change.

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:31.910
And I'm meeting
really great people.

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:37.130
It took a lot of courage for
me to say those things outweigh

00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:44.102
all the other image-related
things that I was so mired in.

00:20:44.102 --> 00:20:45.560
And probably at a
younger age, it's

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:47.893
harder to do that because you
feel like there are things

00:20:47.893 --> 00:20:49.520
that you need to
do, maybe things

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:52.430
that you need to prove either to
your family or to your friends

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:54.380
or to yourself.

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:56.770
But at the end of the day,
what I've come to conclude--

00:20:56.770 --> 00:20:59.750
and I can because I'm
further in my career now--

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:02.790
is, unless it's really
making you thrive,

00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:07.050
unless you feel like my heart
is singing this, I'm learning,

00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:11.070
I'm growing, I'm doing
things that matter to me,

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:13.110
then you're just
spinning wheels.

00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:14.730
Then it's just a job.

00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:17.126
And nobody wants
to have just a job.

00:21:17.126 --> 00:21:19.500
You want to have something
that makes you get up and say,

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:21.300
I can't wait to do this again.

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:23.250
I love the people
I work with I love

00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:27.100
the things that I get to do I
can't wait to do more of this.

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:29.430
And when you stop doing
that, when you stop learning,

00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:31.440
when you stop
growing, and when you

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:34.800
stop being able to feel
like you're contributing,

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:39.284
that's the time to rethink
what's the next thing.

00:21:39.284 --> 00:21:40.450
DAVANG SHAH: Thanks, Soojin.

00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:43.030
One more question
along the same lines.

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:44.890
As the folks in this
room are thinking

00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:47.650
about their next steps, I think
often in the conversations

00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:51.190
I've had and I've heard
happening there's this almost

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:53.950
conflict of, do I pursue
something I'm really passionate

00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:57.750
about versus going to get an MBA
and what role they both play.

00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:59.500
How would you guide
the folks in this room

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:00.708
to think about that conflict?

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:05.380
SOOJIN KWON: I guess it comes
down to a timing thing, right.

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:08.530
If they think an MBA
is in your future,

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:10.690
when is the right time to do it?

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:13.190
There really isn't a wrong
time because now there

00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:15.730
are so many different
times in your career

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:17.180
that you can get it.

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:19.810
The standard path is
with a full-time MBA,

00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:24.010
coming out of undergrad,
working for a number of years,

00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:28.780
and then going back to get
your MBA before you're 30.

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:30.820
There are also
programs like at Ross

00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:34.990
where you can do it part time
while you're working full time.

00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:38.260
And then there are programs like
at Ross where you can get it

00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:40.720
when you've been working
for 10 or more years

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:42.250
as an executive MBA.

00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:44.560
And it's at a different
level that you'll get it.

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:46.900
So there's never a wrong time.

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:50.500
If you have a great professional
opportunity, don't give it up.

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:52.720
If you feel like you're
continuing to do something

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:55.190
where you're learning
and you're growing,

00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:58.030
and if you took
yourself off that path

00:22:58.030 --> 00:23:02.570
to go get an MBA at that
point, then wait a year.

00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:06.010
But if you feel like there
are skills that I can gain now

00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:10.000
that only the MBA could provide
and my current job can't, that

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.037
might be the right
time to get it as well.

00:23:13.037 --> 00:23:13.870
DAVANG SHAH: Thanks.

00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:16.570
It's a good transition to
thinking about MBAs in general.

00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:18.370
How would you
describe Ross and what

00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:21.592
you think makes Ross unique?

00:23:21.592 --> 00:23:23.050
SOOJIN KWON: One
of the things that

00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:25.810
attracted me to Ross
almost 20 years ago

00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:29.680
and still holds true today
is that it's really focused

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:33.160
on allowing you to
do things hands-on.

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:36.220
Not just sitting in class
and learning about theories

00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:38.500
and applying frameworks
to simulations,

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:41.020
but really getting
out and doing things

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:43.660
that you might want
to do, whether it's

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:49.540
consulting or managing a fund
or starting up a business.

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:51.760
All of those things
you can do at Ross

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:55.960
while you're a student with
faculty and alumni advisors,

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:58.030
with resources
that are not yours

00:23:58.030 --> 00:24:01.750
that you're putting at risk,
with the help of classmates

00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:04.310
who have done some of the
things that you may want to do.

00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:06.490
And so it's an
incredible place where,

00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:08.620
if you want to actually
do things and not

00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:12.160
just learn the theory behind
it, you'll get that, too.

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:15.527
There's no better place to
do that than it at Ross.

00:24:15.527 --> 00:24:16.360
DAVANG SHAH: Thanks.

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:19.540
And when you think about the
role of an MBA in context

00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:22.500
of a person's career
path, their life path,

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:26.710
how has that changed over
the last 10 or 20 years?

00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:30.020
SOOJIN KWON: I'd say
it's changed quite a bit.

00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:33.550
If you look at the industries
that students go into,

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:35.980
the recruiters that come
to campus, the choices

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:39.480
that students make about
their careers post-MBA,

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:41.890
it's just exploded.

00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:46.180
25 years ago, people used to
take pretty standard paths--

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:49.690
banking, marketing, consulting.

00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:53.350
Those were really the three
buckets that people went into.

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:55.660
Now, people are doing
all kinds of things.

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:57.840
They are starting up
their own businesses.

00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:59.950
There are so many different
kinds of tech jobs,

00:24:59.950 --> 00:25:01.572
as you guys know.

00:25:01.572 --> 00:25:04.030
There are still students who
go into consulting and finance

00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:07.790
and marketing, but those are
not as big as they used to be.

00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:11.080
And it's no longer a career
for life as so many people

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:14.400
who got MBAs back in
the day used to be.

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:16.450
It's you do one thing
for a few years,

00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:21.290
and then you may pivot your
career in any number of ways.

00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:24.370
And the beauty of the MBA
now is it's giving you

00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:26.800
the skills and the
access to pivot

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:30.010
your career multiple
times, which students now

00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:32.380
are going to be doing much
more than even students

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:34.260
from my generation.

00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:36.510
DAVANG SHAH: So I think
that's one observation I have.

00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:38.176
I've been in the
workforce for 20 years.

00:25:38.176 --> 00:25:39.820
And when I started,
candidly, I would

00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:43.810
think getting a job
meant a job for life.

00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:46.759
And now, people are
changing careers

00:25:46.759 --> 00:25:48.550
quite frequently,
probably five to 10 times

00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:50.710
over the course of
their entire careers.

00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:52.615
What advice do you have
in context of careers

00:25:52.615 --> 00:25:54.990
and when people are thinking
about making those switches?

00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:00.280
SOOJIN KWON: The advice I'd
give is to learn from every role

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:00.940
that you have.

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:05.650
Learn not just the skills that
are required for the position

00:26:05.650 --> 00:26:08.350
that you're in, but also
learn about yourself.

00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:09.550
What motivates you?

00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:12.220
What about that particular
role at that time

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:14.380
really interested
you so that you

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:16.990
can get closer to what
it is that's going

00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:19.180
to be your nirvana.

00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:22.940
And it may change
over time, too.

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:27.820
I never knew that I would
love speaking as much as I do,

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:29.290
frankly.

00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:31.390
It used to scare
the heck out of me,

00:26:31.390 --> 00:26:33.490
and you could never
get me to be the person

00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:37.040
to stand in front of a
class or a large group

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:38.750
to volunteer to speak.

00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:41.860
And now, through
this role, because I

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:43.910
had to, because I've
done it quite a bit,

00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:48.892
and because I enjoy
sharing what I know,

00:26:48.892 --> 00:26:51.100
I've learned that I love
something that I never would

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:53.500
have imagined that I love.

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:55.780
So it's exposing yourself
to different things

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:58.610
and getting good at everything,
even if you don't love it,

00:26:58.610 --> 00:27:01.690
because you may find
eventually you do love it

00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:05.870
and that's the thing that
makes you say, this is so fun.

00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:08.560
I can't wait to do it again.

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:10.497
DAVANG SHAH: So in your
role, you obviously

00:27:10.497 --> 00:27:12.580
shape both the admissions
and what the class looks

00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:15.580
like, and you also shape
what the program looks like.

00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:18.070
I'd love to hear from
your perspective, what

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:21.430
are some of the biggest
mistakes applicants make?

00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:24.010
And then also, in context
of students who are actually

00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:25.560
pursuing and already
in the program,

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:26.560
what are those mistakes?

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:30.787
What are the things people
should be looking out for?

00:27:30.787 --> 00:27:33.370
SOOJIN KWON: I think the biggest
mistakes both as an applicant

00:27:33.370 --> 00:27:35.350
and as a student
are quite the same.

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:37.720
It's inauthenticity.

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:40.690
It's trying to be
someone that you're not,

00:27:40.690 --> 00:27:43.630
trying to make yourself
at the applicant stage

00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:46.600
look like the
quintessential MBA applicant

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:49.600
rather than really just talking
about yourself as you are

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:51.520
and what you want to do.

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:54.967
These days, unlike
20 or more years ago,

00:27:54.967 --> 00:27:56.050
there is no cookie cutter.

00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:59.080
There is no traditional
MBA candidate.

00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:00.610
They are so different.

00:28:00.610 --> 00:28:02.560
We have people coming
from the Peace Corps

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:06.400
and from Teach for America
and from the military,

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:09.520
from nonprofits, from medicine.

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:15.520
This wasn't standard when 20,
30 years ago my classmates

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:18.029
and before me we're
going to school.

00:28:18.029 --> 00:28:20.320
I was a nontraditional student
going to business school

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:21.490
at that time.

00:28:21.490 --> 00:28:23.710
Most of my classmates
had come from some kind

00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:24.910
of business role.

00:28:24.910 --> 00:28:26.350
I came from Capitol Hill.

00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:28.270
I felt like a fish out of water.

00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:30.280
But that's not uncommon anymore.

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:33.010
Students are coming with
really different backgrounds.

00:28:33.010 --> 00:28:34.690
Yet, a lot of
applicants think they

00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:38.260
have to look like the perfect
business school applicant.

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:40.880
Same thing for when
students are in the program.

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:43.309
They get sucked into the,
oh, I should do consulting

00:28:43.309 --> 00:28:45.100
because everybody else
is doing consulting,

00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:47.099
or I should do finance
because everybody else is

00:28:47.099 --> 00:28:48.670
doing finance.

00:28:48.670 --> 00:28:50.290
Business school
is an opportunity

00:28:50.290 --> 00:28:55.690
to learn what's out there and to
learn what really motivates you

00:28:55.690 --> 00:28:59.980
and then really jumping
into learning those things.

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:03.670
So you shouldn't
have to feel that you

00:29:03.670 --> 00:29:06.340
need to be this quintessential
MBA student either.

00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:09.940
Or, post-MBA, you
don't need to do

00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:12.770
the career paths at all of
your classmates are doing.

00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:14.740
The beauty of the degree
is it's giving you

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:17.000
options to do different things.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.050
And so I would encourage
you guys to have the courage

00:29:20.050 --> 00:29:23.080
to do really different things.

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:24.280
DAVANG SHAH: Thank you.

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:27.220
One more question about
the program and the class.

00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:31.210
How are you thinking about
creating a diverse environment

00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:33.500
both from a perspective
of the content

00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:36.120
but also the program
makeup in the students

00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:39.682
and creating an environment
that's inclusive?

00:29:39.682 --> 00:29:41.890
SOOJIN KWON: I can't tell
you how important diversity

00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:45.700
is to us, to me personally.

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:48.250
This year, I'm really proud
that our women numbers

00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:52.450
are at a record high,
at 43% in the MBA class.

00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:56.320
I would love that to be
50-50, more in line with what

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:59.980
you see at the undergrad level.

00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:03.364
We truly believe that,
without a diverse class,

00:30:03.364 --> 00:30:04.780
you're not going
to learn as much.

00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:06.489
Without people from
different backgrounds

00:30:06.489 --> 00:30:07.905
with different
experiences who are

00:30:07.905 --> 00:30:10.240
going to make you think about
things in a different way,

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:12.460
you're just going to be
thinking the same way

00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:13.840
that you were before.

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:16.360
And the whole point of school
is to learn different ways

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:17.797
of thinking about things.

00:30:17.797 --> 00:30:20.380
It's about how your mind works
and how you approach situations

00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:21.670
and problems.

00:30:21.670 --> 00:30:26.800
And if everyone comes from the
same industry or the same life

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:30.040
circumstances, you're
not going to grow.

00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:32.380
Our job is to give you
an environment where

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:35.980
you are going to grow the
most, and that is in large part

00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:38.000
through the classmates
that you have.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.300
So we are so focused
on making sure

00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:43.720
that the student body looks
very diverse not just in terms

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:48.010
of gender, but color,
nationality, backgrounds,

00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:49.960
geographies, career goals.

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:51.940
All those things
matter because we

00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:55.807
want you to learn from people
who are different from you.

00:30:55.807 --> 00:30:56.890
DAVANG SHAH: That's great.

00:30:56.890 --> 00:30:57.760
Last question.

00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:00.580
This is one to be a little
more playful and fun.

00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:02.440
You're applying
for an MBA program.

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:05.350
Yes, I told you and
I'm holding to it.

00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:06.850
You're applying
to an MBA program.

00:31:06.850 --> 00:31:08.230
You can't apply to Ross.

00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:09.880
What other program
do you apply to?

00:31:14.164 --> 00:31:14.830
SOOJIN KWON: OK.

00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:19.080
I will give a nod to you just
because he's the co-host here.

00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:22.060
Devan went to Yale
School of Management.

00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:24.010
And that's my undergrad,
so it does have

00:31:24.010 --> 00:31:25.580
a special place in my heart.

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:27.710
And that's how I
got to meet him.

00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:29.154
But I'm not endorsing it.

00:31:29.154 --> 00:31:31.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:34.570
I'll tell you where we have the
most overlaps in applications

00:31:34.570 --> 00:31:37.830
because we have visibility into
that from GMAT test takers.

00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:43.240
And that is we overlap largely
with Kellogg, with Duke,

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:48.330
with Wharton,
Berkeley, Yale, Tuck.

00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:49.810
All of those are great schools.

00:31:49.810 --> 00:31:52.450
The thing is, any of those
schools are going to be great.

00:31:52.450 --> 00:31:55.030
It's about you making the
most of the opportunities

00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:57.110
that you have wherever you are.

00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:59.860
But of course, I'm pretty
partial to Michigan.

00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:03.550
The student body
and the opportunity

00:32:03.550 --> 00:32:06.310
do action-based
learning, it's really

00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:08.980
different from all the
other schools in my opinion.

00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:11.952
But I encourage you to
check it out yourself.

00:32:11.952 --> 00:32:13.660
If you're thinking
about business school,

00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:14.470
talk to students.

00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:17.244
Talk to alums in every school
that you're considering.

00:32:17.244 --> 00:32:19.660
Go visit because you're going
to get a feel for the school

00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:21.790
and for the vibe
there because that's

00:32:21.790 --> 00:32:25.270
going to make the difference
between whether you get an MBA

00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:27.670
or you have this
great springboard

00:32:27.670 --> 00:32:31.454
for ideas and opportunities.

00:32:31.454 --> 00:32:33.370
So it's about finding
the right place for you,

00:32:33.370 --> 00:32:36.650
and you'll hear every
admissions director say that.

00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:38.650
DAVANG SHAH: Thank you
for the authentic answer.

00:32:38.650 --> 00:32:39.730
And it is very true.

00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:42.340
I think your
perspective, when you

00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:44.920
make that decision to
go pursue a degree,

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:46.180
it's not just about the MBA.

00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:48.040
It's about changing
the way you think,

00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:49.580
and it can have a
profound impact.

00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:51.750
So thank you.
