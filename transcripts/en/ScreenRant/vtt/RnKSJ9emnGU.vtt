00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.660
Casting is one of the most important aspects
of making a film.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.389
If the director doesn’t find just the right
actor for each part, the whole project could

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:16.670
be derailed before it even hits theaters.

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.130
And throughout the process, filmmakers will
sometimes go through a number of actors before

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.530
settling on the final choice – dodging a
few bullets in the process.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.560
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 terrible movie
castings that Could Have happened.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.630
The Lord of the Rings

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.010
One of the highlights of Peter Jackson’s
Lord of the Rings trilogy was Ian McKellen’s

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.570
performance as the friendly but powerful wizard
Gandalf.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.640
Actor and character are so inseparable, it’s
hard to envision anyone else in the role,

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.149
but Jackson originally wanted Sean Connery
to whisk Frodo away on his journey to Mordor.

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.649
Nothing against Connery’s ability as an
actor, but his talents as a suave gentleman

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:51.899
spy don’t seem the proper fit for the part.

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.880
Not only that, Connery claimed he didn’t
understand the script, so fantasy fans everywhere

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.399
were better off.

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:58.399
The Matrix

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:03.629
Keanu Reeves may seem a long shot for an avalanche
of Oscars, but he’s solid gold in an action

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:04.629
role.

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.640
No part was more suited to his style than
Neo, ‘The One’ able to unite mankind against

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.850
The Matrix.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.060
The Wachowskis first offered the part to Will
Smith, but the Fresh Prince turned it down,

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.280
unconvinced by their pitch of a Machine-ruled
future.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.201
After seeing the film, Smith admitted he wouldn’t
have been as good as Reeves, so it’s for

00:01:20.201 --> 00:01:23.990
the best he turned it down.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.990
Donnie Darko

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.180
A young Jake Gyllenhaal turned heads with
his impressive turn as the title star of the

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.619
moody Donnie Darko, but he wasn’t the first
choice.

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.590
That honor goes to Vince Vaughn, who was coming
off the success of Jon Favreau’s debut,

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:37.590
Swingers.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.130
When offered the role, Vaughn had the common
sense to turn it down.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.470
Even if he proved he can handle dramatic roles,
his age would have been a massive problem.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.100
We doubt many moviegoers would be able to
buy the 30-year old Vaughn as a high school

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.100
student.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.100
Star Wars

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.970
Han Solo is defined by his roguish charm,
and the personality fit actor Harrison Ford

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.720
like a glove, which is why the character became
one of the most iconic in the Star Wars saga.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.079
But George Lucas was initially reluctant to
cast Ford in the role and tested several others

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:06.420
during pre-production.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.369
One of the actors was none other than Christopher
Walken.

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.760
Everyone loves the charismatic Walken, who
is absolutely an awards-worthy talent, but

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.690
it’s hard to picture him as a Corellian
smuggler.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.629
Walken’s known for playing odd people who
are “out there,” so it’s hard to believe

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:24.019
the original movie’s tone would have survived
with him in the cast.

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.959
The Terminator

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:35.480
There’s no doubt about it: Arnold Schwarzenegger
was born to play The Terminator.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.279
He had the physique and the demeanor to convincingly
play a killer cyborg, but early on, director

00:02:40.279 --> 00:02:42.790
James Cameron had another actor in mind.

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.579
His infamous top choice was football star
turned screen actor O.J. Simpson, but producers

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:52.180
rejected the idea, saying the charismatic
Simpson was too likable to portray a killer.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.769
Fate had a rather ironic way of proving them
wrong, but Arnold was still the right choice,

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:00.599
launching one of the greatest action careers
in movie history.

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.169
American Psycho

00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:06.029
In one of his breakout roles as a grown-up
movie star, Christian Bale illustrated his

00:03:06.029 --> 00:03:10.459
mesmerizing ability to lose himself in a role
by playing the chilling Patrick Bateman in

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:11.829
American Psycho.

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:15.730
Originally, Leonardo DiCaprio was going to
be the one talking about Huey Lewis and the

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.670
News, hot off the blockbuster Titanic.

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.349
Lionsgate wanted the heartthrob for the lead,
but DiCaprio backed out to make The Beach

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:23.349
instead.

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:25.379
It’s probably for the best this didn’t
pan out.

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:29.680
Though Leo has played a wide range of interesting
characters, at the time he still had a boyish

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:36.599
look – hard to take seriously as a psychopathic
New York yuppie.

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:37.829
The Shining

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:41.689
Jack Torrance is one of Jack Nicholson’s
most famous roles, but he wasn’t Stanley

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:44.109
Kubrick’s first choice to head to the Overlook
Hotel.

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:48.279
He initially considered Robin Williams for
the part, but changed his mind after seeing

00:03:48.279 --> 00:03:51.200
the actor’s famous turn on the TV show Mork
and Mindy.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.049
Apparently, the show convinced Kubrick that
Williams was “too psychotic” for Torrance

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:58.689
and he went in a different direction.

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:04.760
Williams eventually turned in some incredible
dramatic roles, but at the height of his comedy

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.810
success, it may have been jarring for viewers
to see the zany funnyman chase his wife with

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.379
an axe.

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:11.379
Dirty Harry

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:16.199
With his trademark scowl and growl, few actors
have put a stamp on a character like Clint

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:18.150
Eastwood did with “Dirty” Harry Callahan.

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.430
But what if Frank Sinatra was the one asking
punks if they felt lucky?

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.730
The legendary crooner was Warner Bros.’s
first pick for the role, but Sinatra had to

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.650
drop out when a broken wrist made holding
Harry’s signature magnum impossible.

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.919
Sinatra’s a star in his own right, but a
no-nonsense action hero is more Eastwood’s

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:34.919
forte.

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:38.720
He was legitimately frightening in character,
and it’s hard to imagine Sinatra inspiring

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.540
an equal amount of fear.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:42.879
Bad Boys

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:46.810
Will Smith didn’t turn down every blockbuster
role that came his way, going down in action

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.920
movie history alongside Martin Lawrence in
Michael Bay’s Bad Boys series.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.129
However, the movie could have gone in a completely
different direction, since it was originally

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:59.500
written with Saturday Night Live alums Dana
Carvey and Jon Lovitz under the title: Bulletproof

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.500
Hearts.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.540
Those plans apparently fell through when Carvey
witnessed some… questionable behavior by

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.889
producer Don Simpson at a Las Vegas party.

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:11.860
Movie fans are probably thankful for Simpson’s
wilder days, since Smith and Lawrence turned

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.460
in a truly refreshing dose of buddy cop comedy.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:16.460
Rocky

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.610
One of the main reasons Rocky’s underdog
story became such a hit was just how clearly

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.580
Sylvester Stallone embodied the down-on-his-luck
boxer – after all, he wrote the script himself.

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.719
But the studio wanted to see a more established
star in the lead, with Robert Redford and

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:31.849
Burt Reynolds two names offered.

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:35.319
That may have been a tough sell for audiences,
since an A-lister went against what the role

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:36.520
was all about.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.860
Stallone refused to sell his script unless
he could play Rocky, and history was made.

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.020
The decision cut the film’s budget by $1
million, but in the end, was the secret to

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.860
the entire franchise’s success.

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.389
Those are our picks for terrible casting decisions
that almost happened.

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:53.270
