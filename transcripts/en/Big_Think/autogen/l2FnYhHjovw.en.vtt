a issue with the dynamic ones it is um

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:16.130
a issue with the dynamic ones it is um
 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:18.650
a issue with the dynamic ones it is um
let's step back what is it by dynamic

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660
let's step back what is it by dynamic
 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.950
let's step back what is it by dynamic
one there is a guy named Rudolf Steiner

one there is a guy named Rudolf Steiner
who founded by better the biodynamic one

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769
who founded by better the biodynamic one
 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.830
who founded by better the biodynamic one
movement and he had very quirky ideas

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840
movement and he had very quirky ideas
 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.389
movement and he had very quirky ideas
about making one but many of these

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399
about making one but many of these
 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.319
about making one but many of these
practices have proved to improve the

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329
practices have proved to improve the
 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.869
practices have proved to improve the
sort of the vineyards the health of the

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879
sort of the vineyards the health of the
 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.430
sort of the vineyards the health of the
vineyards and that's what really we're

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440
vineyards and that's what really we're
 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.869
vineyards and that's what really we're
talking about having healthy vines and

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879
talking about having healthy vines and
 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.990
talking about having healthy vines and
help healthy grapes um he was interested

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000
help healthy grapes um he was interested
 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.420
help healthy grapes um he was interested
in harvesting in the moonlight he was

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430
in harvesting in the moonlight he was
 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.349
in harvesting in the moonlight he was
interested in cow horns filled with dung

00:00:59.349 --> 00:00:59.359
interested in cow horns filled with dung
 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:02.060
interested in cow horns filled with dung
planted in the vineyard so there's some

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070
planted in the vineyard so there's some
 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.619
planted in the vineyard so there's some
quirky things that go along with

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629
quirky things that go along with
 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.640
quirky things that go along with
biodynamic wine um but but basically

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650
biodynamic wine um but but basically
 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.660
biodynamic wine um but but basically
we're talking about the health at the

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670
we're talking about the health at the
 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.490
we're talking about the health at the
vineyard and if you have a healthy

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500
vineyard and if you have a healthy
 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.679
vineyard and if you have a healthy
vineyard you should have a really great

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689
vineyard you should have a really great
 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.190
vineyard you should have a really great
one with organic it's actually a tricky

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200
one with organic it's actually a tricky
 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.710
one with organic it's actually a tricky
proposition because in terms of

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720
proposition because in terms of
 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.240
proposition because in terms of
winemaking you what you're looking at

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250
winemaking you what you're looking at
 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.960
winemaking you what you're looking at
usually is organic grapes but there's an

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970
usually is organic grapes but there's an
 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.740
usually is organic grapes but there's an
entire organic wine making process and

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750
entire organic wine making process and
 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.719
entire organic wine making process and
that sometimes why makers will not carry

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729
that sometimes why makers will not carry
 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.469
that sometimes why makers will not carry
through so it's that it's the labeling

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479
through so it's that it's the labeling
 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.630
through so it's that it's the labeling
is a little dicey so I think what we'll

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640
is a little dicey so I think what we'll
 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.850
is a little dicey so I think what we'll
see is wines made from organic grapes

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860
see is wines made from organic grapes
 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.550
see is wines made from organic grapes
probably not the entire process the ones

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560
probably not the entire process the ones
 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.149
probably not the entire process the ones
that are that are green and that I'm are

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159
that are that are green and that I'm are
 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.230
that are that are green and that I'm are
not always reliable are the ones that

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240
not always reliable are the ones that
 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.770
not always reliable are the ones that
are made without sulfides and so in

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780
are made without sulfides and so in
 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.840
are made without sulfides and so in
France there's an enormous movement and

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850
France there's an enormous movement and
 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.109
France there's an enormous movement and
there's wine bars that you know just

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119
there's wine bars that you know just
 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.810
there's wine bars that you know just
have these you know great ones green

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820
have these you know great ones green
 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.179
have these you know great ones green
ones without sulfites those ones aren't

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189
ones without sulfites those ones aren't
 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.030
ones without sulfites those ones aren't
very stable because the sulfides help to

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040
very stable because the sulfides help to
 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.050
very stable because the sulfides help to
stabilize the wine so um that I think is

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060
stabilize the wine so um that I think is
 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.930
stabilize the wine so um that I think is
where you can get an amazing amazing

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940
where you can get an amazing amazing
 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.200
where you can get an amazing amazing
wine

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210
wine
 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.910
wine
without sulfides but boy you have to be

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920
without sulfides but boy you have to be
 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.150
without sulfides but boy you have to be
careful in yer
