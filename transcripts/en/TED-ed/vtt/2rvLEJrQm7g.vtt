00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:10.114
It’s another sweltering morning 
in Memphis, Egypt.

00:00:10.124 --> 00:00:14.084
As the sunlight brightens the Nile, 
Peseshet checks her supplies.

00:00:14.084 --> 00:00:14.924
Honey,

00:00:14.924 --> 00:00:15.808
garlic,

00:00:15.808 --> 00:00:16.537
cumin,

00:00:16.537 --> 00:00:17.291
acacia leaves,

00:00:17.291 --> 00:00:19.155
cedar oil.

00:00:19.155 --> 00:00:23.134
She’s well stocked with the essentials 
she needs to treat her patients.

00:00:23.134 --> 00:00:25.722
Peseshet is a swnw, or a doctor.

00:00:25.722 --> 00:00:27.274
In order to become one,

00:00:27.274 --> 00:00:29.036
she had to train as a scribe

00:00:29.036 --> 00:00:34.541
and study the medical papyri stored 
at the Per Ankh, the House of Life.

00:00:34.541 --> 00:00:37.433
Now, she teaches her own students there.

00:00:37.433 --> 00:00:40.470
Before teaching, 
Peseshet has a patient to see.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.503
One of the workers at the temple 
construction site has injured his arm.

00:00:44.503 --> 00:00:46.053
When Peseshet arrives,

00:00:46.053 --> 00:00:48.457
the laborer’s arm is clearly broken,

00:00:48.457 --> 00:00:53.384
and worse, the fracture is a sed, 
with multiple bone fragments.

00:00:53.384 --> 00:00:56.126
Peseshet binds and immobilizes the injury.

00:00:56.126 --> 00:00:58.993
Her next stop is the House of Life.

00:00:58.993 --> 00:01:02.891
On her way, a woman intercepts 
Peseshet in the street.

00:01:02.891 --> 00:01:05.531
The woman’s son 
has been stung by a scorpion.

00:01:05.531 --> 00:01:10.649
Peseshet has seen many similar stings 
and knows exactly what to do.

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:14.278
She must say an incantation 
to cast the poison out.

00:01:14.278 --> 00:01:16.436
She begins to recite the spell,

00:01:16.436 --> 00:01:21.406
invoking Serqet, patron of physicians 
and goddess of venomous creatures.

00:01:21.406 --> 00:01:25.684
Peseshet recites the spell 
as if she is Serqet.

00:01:25.684 --> 00:01:29.919
This commanding approach 
has the greatest chance at success.

00:01:29.919 --> 00:01:31.477
After she utters the last line,

00:01:31.477 --> 00:01:35.888
she tries to cut the poison out 
with a knife for good measure.

00:01:35.888 --> 00:01:39.706
Peseshet packs up to leave,
but the woman has another question.

00:01:39.706 --> 00:01:42.996
She wants to find out if she is pregnant.

00:01:42.996 --> 00:01:46.361
Peseshet explains 
her fail-safe pregnancy test:

00:01:46.361 --> 00:01:50.000
plant two seeds: one barley, one emmer.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.198
Then, urinate on the seeds every day.

00:01:52.198 --> 00:01:54.819
If the plants grow, she’s pregnant.

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:57.250
A barley seedling predicts a baby boy,

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.774
while emmer foretells a girl.

00:01:59.774 --> 00:02:04.043
Peseshet also recommends a prayer
to Hathor, goddess of fertility.

00:02:04.043 --> 00:02:07.412
When Peseshet finally arrives 
at the House of Life,

00:02:07.412 --> 00:02:10.073
she runs into the doctor-priest Isesi.

00:02:10.073 --> 00:02:14.911
She greets Isesi politely, but she thinks
priests are very full of themselves.

00:02:14.911 --> 00:02:17.810
She doesn’t envy Isesi’s role 
as neru pehut,

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.431
which directly translates to herdsman 
of the anus to the royal family,

00:02:22.431 --> 00:02:25.444
or, guardian of the royal anus.

00:02:25.444 --> 00:02:29.741
Inside, the House of Life is bustling 
as usual with scribes,

00:02:29.741 --> 00:02:30.584
priests,

00:02:30.584 --> 00:02:31.453
doctors,

00:02:31.453 --> 00:02:32.694
and students.

00:02:32.694 --> 00:02:36.633
Papyri containing all kinds of records, 
not just medical information,

00:02:36.633 --> 00:02:38.099
are stored here.

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.187
Peseshet’s son Akhethetep is hard 
at work copying documents

00:02:42.187 --> 00:02:44.667
as part of his training 
to become a scribe.

00:02:44.667 --> 00:02:46.843
He’s a particularly promising student,

00:02:46.843 --> 00:02:50.253
but he was admitted to study 
because Peseshet is a scribe,

00:02:50.253 --> 00:02:52.333
as was her father before her.

00:02:52.333 --> 00:02:54.002
Without family in the profession,

00:02:54.002 --> 00:02:57.484
it’s very difficult for boys, 
and impossible for girls,

00:02:57.484 --> 00:02:59.700
to pursue this education.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.745
Peseshet oversees all the female 
swnws and swnws-in-training in Memphis.

00:03:04.745 --> 00:03:06.871
The men have their own overseer,

00:03:06.871 --> 00:03:10.173
as the male doctors 
won’t answer to a woman.

00:03:10.173 --> 00:03:12.381
Today, Peseshet teaches anatomy.

00:03:12.381 --> 00:03:14.636
She quizzes her students on the metu,

00:03:14.636 --> 00:03:17.051
the body’s vessels that transport blood,

00:03:17.051 --> 00:03:17.790
air,

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:18.670
urine,

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.695
and even bad spirits.

00:03:20.695 --> 00:03:22.596
Peseshet is preparing to leave

00:03:22.596 --> 00:03:27.062
when a pale, thin woman accosts her 
at the door and begs to be examined.

00:03:27.062 --> 00:03:30.330
The woman has a huge, 
sore lump under her arm.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.827
Peseshet probes the growth 
and finds it cool to the touch

00:03:33.827 --> 00:03:36.715
and hard like an unripe hemat fruit.

00:03:36.715 --> 00:03:39.766
She has read about ailments 
like this, but never seen one.

00:03:39.766 --> 00:03:43.537
For this tumor there is no treatment, 
medicine or spell.

00:03:43.537 --> 00:03:47.295
All the texts give the same advice: 
do nothing.

00:03:47.295 --> 00:03:51.044
After delivering the bad news, 
Peseshet goes outside.

00:03:51.044 --> 00:03:53.610
She lingers on the steps
of the House of Life,

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.678
admiring the city at dusk.

00:03:55.678 --> 00:03:57.504
In spite of all her hard work,

00:03:57.504 --> 00:04:00.065
there will always be patients 
she can’t help,

00:04:00.065 --> 00:04:02.040
like the woman with the tumor.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.679
They linger with her,
but Peseshet has no time to dwell.

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:07.202
In a few short weeks,

00:04:07.202 --> 00:04:09.011
the Nile’s annual flooding will begin,

00:04:09.011 --> 00:04:11.987
bringing life to the soil for 
the next year’s harvest

00:04:11.987 --> 00:04:14.337
and a whole new crop of patients.
