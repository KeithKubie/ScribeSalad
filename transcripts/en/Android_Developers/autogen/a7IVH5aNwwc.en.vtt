gonna walk you through actually building

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:08.390
gonna walk you through actually building
 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:10.510
gonna walk you through actually building
your first slices but before that I want

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520
your first slices but before that I want
 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.560
your first slices but before that I want
to give you a little bit of an idea of

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:11.570
to give you a little bit of an idea of
 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.780
to give you a little bit of an idea of
how slices work and what they how they

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:13.790
how slices work and what they how they
 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.840
how slices work and what they how they
look under the hood so the slice is what

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:16.850
look under the hood so the slice is what
 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.230
look under the hood so the slice is what
a slice actually is in terms of you know

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240
a slice actually is in terms of you know
 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.150
a slice actually is in terms of you know
implementation is its structured data

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160
implementation is its structured data
 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.040
implementation is its structured data
and that structured data contains other

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050
and that structured data contains other
 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.920
and that structured data contains other
slices content and presentational hints

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930
slices content and presentational hints
 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.350
slices content and presentational hints
and so one thing to note this is not

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360
and so one thing to note this is not
 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.000
and so one thing to note this is not
actually code on the screen I know it

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010

looks kind of like a DSL but this is

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050
looks kind of like a DSL but this is
 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:34.660
looks kind of like a DSL but this is
really a string representation of what

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:34.670
really a string representation of what
 

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:35.800
really a string representation of what
you would construct once you're actually

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810
you would construct once you're actually
 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:38.140
you would construct once you're actually
done building a slice on there a few

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.150
done building a slice on there a few

done building a slice on there a few
things that we extract out of this

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:39.350
things that we extract out of this
 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:42.370
things that we extract out of this
information the structure that it has

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380
information the structure that it has
 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.140
information the structure that it has
determines to the template and like what

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150
determines to the template and like what
 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.210
determines to the template and like what
we're seeing like this example of a

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:46.220
we're seeing like this example of a
 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:50.220
we're seeing like this example of a
horizontal weather slice it also

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:50.230
horizontal weather slice it also
 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:52.080
horizontal weather slice it also
contains

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.090
contains
 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.780
contains
the content itself icons text pending

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:55.790

intents for interactivity and the other

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:57.980
intents for interactivity and the other
 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.580
intents for interactivity and the other
thing to note is that this contains all

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:00.590
thing to note is that this contains all
 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:02.140
thing to note is that this contains all
of the data for the slice no matter the

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:02.150
of the data for the slice no matter the
 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:03.340
of the data for the slice no matter the
format maddie is going to talk you

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:03.350
format maddie is going to talk you
 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:04.810
format maddie is going to talk you
through all of the format's that we have

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:04.820
through all of the format's that we have
 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.370
through all of the format's that we have
for slices right now and how we may add

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:06.380
for slices right now and how we may add
 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.460
for slices right now and how we may add
more in the future to but a single slice

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:09.470
more in the future to but a single slice
 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:11.440
more in the future to but a single slice
that you return in your app will

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:11.450
that you return in your app will
 

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.360
that you return in your app will
actually hold all of the formats and so

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:13.370
actually hold all of the formats and so
 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.220
actually hold all of the formats and so
on the right we have a shortcut version

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:15.230
on the right we have a shortcut version
 

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:17.740
on the right we have a shortcut version
of that same slice and that is using the

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:17.750
of that same slice and that is using the
 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.630
of that same slice and that is using the
exact same data to present in a

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:19.640
exact same data to present in a
 

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:23.260
exact same data to present in a
different format all right so how do you

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:23.270
different format all right so how do you
 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.600
different format all right so how do you
how to apps actually get ahold of slices

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:25.610
how to apps actually get ahold of slices
 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:28.810
how to apps actually get ahold of slices
from your app so slices sit on top of

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:28.820
from your app so slices sit on top of
 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.910
from your app so slices sit on top of

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.920
content providers slice provider extends
a content provider don't worry we try to

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:32.930
a content provider don't worry we try to
 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:34.600
a content provider don't worry we try to
hide as much of the content provider as

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:34.610
hide as much of the content provider as
 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.000
hide as much of the content provider as
possible for you but there are a few

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.010
possible for you but there are a few
 

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:38.200
possible for you but there are a few
really nice things that come out of this

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:38.210
really nice things that come out of this
 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:39.790
really nice things that come out of this
is that they're based on top of content

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:39.800
is that they're based on top of content
 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:40.390
is that they're based on top of content
you are eyes

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:40.400
you are eyes
 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.499
you are eyes
which means you can have a wide variety

00:06:41.499 --> 00:06:41.509
which means you can have a wide variety
 

00:06:41.509 --> 00:06:45.700
which means you can have a wide variety
of slices hosted from your app and when

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:45.710
of slices hosted from your app and when
 

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:47.530
of slices hosted from your app and when
an app wants to show your slice you'll

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:47.540
an app wants to show your slice you'll
 

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.029
an app wants to show your slice you'll
get a callback to unbind slice and

00:06:49.029 --> 00:06:49.039
get a callback to unbind slice and
 

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:50.379
get a callback to unbind slice and
you'll get a URI and you'll get to

00:06:50.379 --> 00:06:50.389
you'll get a URI and you'll get to
 

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:52.180
you'll get a URI and you'll get to
decide what content you want to connect

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:52.190
decide what content you want to connect
 

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:55.090
decide what content you want to connect
to that URI and return it in that slice

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:55.100
to that URI and return it in that slice
 

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.189
to that URI and return it in that slice
that I just showed you but then there

00:06:57.189 --> 00:06:57.199
that I just showed you but then there
 

00:06:57.199 --> 00:06:58.390
that I just showed you but then there
they're interactive so you need to

00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400
they're interactive so you need to
 

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.040
they're interactive so you need to
actually be able to update that and the

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:00.050
actually be able to update that and the
 

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:01.300
actually be able to update that and the
way that works is through a notify

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:01.310
way that works is through a notify
 

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:03.010
way that works is through a notify
change you send a standard content

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:03.020
change you send a standard content
 

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:04.840
change you send a standard content
provider notify change on your slice URI

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:04.850
provider notify change on your slice URI
 

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:06.909
provider notify change on your slice URI
and whoever is presenting your slice

00:07:06.909 --> 00:07:06.919
and whoever is presenting your slice
 

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:08.560
and whoever is presenting your slice
will know that it's time to update and

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:08.570
will know that it's time to update and
 

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:09.790
will know that it's time to update and
they'll give you another callback and

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:09.800
they'll give you another callback and
 

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.409
they'll give you another callback and
you can return different data that is

00:07:11.409 --> 00:07:11.419
you can return different data that is
 

00:07:11.419 --> 00:07:13.330
you can return different data that is
you know dynamic and changes in response

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:13.340
you know dynamic and changes in response
 

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:16.510
you know dynamic and changes in response
to whatever has happened all right now

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:16.520
to whatever has happened all right now
 

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:17.740
to whatever has happened all right now
I'm gonna hand it over to Maddy who's

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:17.750
I'm gonna hand it over to Maddy who's
 

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:18.790
I'm gonna hand it over to Maddy who's
gonna walk you through building your

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:18.800
gonna walk you through building your
 

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.180
gonna walk you through building your
first slice thanks Jason for that

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:22.190
first slice thanks Jason for that
 

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:25.600
first slice thanks Jason for that
architectural overview I'm going to walk

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:25.610
architectural overview I'm going to walk
 

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:29.080
architectural overview I'm going to walk
you through an app creating this Wi-Fi

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:29.090
you through an app creating this Wi-Fi
 

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:32.980
you through an app creating this Wi-Fi
slice today so we're going to build a

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:32.990
slice today so we're going to build a
 

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:35.350
slice today so we're going to build a
slice provider that provides this Wi-Fi

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:35.360
slice provider that provides this Wi-Fi
 

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:39.040
slice provider that provides this Wi-Fi
space that has this toggle and tapping

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:39.050
space that has this toggle and tapping
 

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:40.749
space that has this toggle and tapping
the toggle will turn Wi-Fi on and off

00:07:40.749 --> 00:07:40.759
the toggle will turn Wi-Fi on and off
 

00:07:40.759 --> 00:07:43.330
the toggle will turn Wi-Fi on and off
and then the connected state will change

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:43.340
and then the connected state will change
 

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:47.290
and then the connected state will change
based on the Wi-Fi state so the first

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:47.300
based on the Wi-Fi state so the first
 

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.360
based on the Wi-Fi state so the first
thing you've got to do is define a slice

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:49.370
thing you've got to do is define a slice
 

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:51.070
thing you've got to do is define a slice
provider in your Android manifest as

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:51.080
provider in your Android manifest as
 

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.350
provider in your Android manifest as
Jason mentioned slices are built on top

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:53.360
Jason mentioned slices are built on top
 

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.060
Jason mentioned slices are built on top
of content providers - similar to a kind

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:55.070
of content providers - similar to a kind
 

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:57.610
of content providers - similar to a kind
of provider you got a define a cure this

00:07:57.610 --> 00:07:57.620
of provider you got a define a cure this
 

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:59.879
of provider you got a define a cure this
lets the operating system be able to

00:07:59.879 --> 00:07:59.889
lets the operating system be able to
 

00:07:59.889 --> 00:08:04.719
lets the operating system be able to
find your slices then you have to

00:08:04.719 --> 00:08:04.729
find your slices then you have to
 

00:08:04.729 --> 00:08:06.909
find your slices then you have to
implement your site's provider and a

00:08:06.909 --> 00:08:06.919
implement your site's provider and a
 

00:08:06.919 --> 00:08:09.219
implement your site's provider and a
slice provider this links provider

00:08:09.219 --> 00:08:09.229
slice provider this links provider
 

00:08:09.229 --> 00:08:11.500
slice provider this links provider
handles multiple slices carrots so we

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:11.510
handles multiple slices carrots so we
 

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:13.870
handles multiple slices carrots so we
have a Wi-Fi slice an alarm slice and a

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:13.880
have a Wi-Fi slice an alarm slice and a
 

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.330
have a Wi-Fi slice an alarm slice and a
nightlight slice so what will happen

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:16.340
nightlight slice so what will happen
 

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:19.719
nightlight slice so what will happen
when when something is trying to display

00:08:19.719 --> 00:08:19.729
when when something is trying to display
 

00:08:19.729 --> 00:08:23.379
when when something is trying to display
your slice you might type in Wi-Fi into

00:08:23.379 --> 00:08:23.389
your slice you might type in Wi-Fi into
 

00:08:23.389 --> 00:08:26.020
your slice you might type in Wi-Fi into
Google search and it's going to do some

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:26.030
Google search and it's going to do some
 

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:28.390
Google search and it's going to do some
ranking stuff but Jason will go into

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:28.400
ranking stuff but Jason will go into
 

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:32.409
ranking stuff but Jason will go into
some details later and it'll map that

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:32.419
some details later and it'll map that
 

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:35.890
some details later and it'll map that
search term to a Content URI and in our

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:35.900
search term to a Content URI and in our
 

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:38.490
search term to a Content URI and in our
case that content URI will be this Wi-Fi

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:38.500
case that content URI will be this Wi-Fi
 

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:41.980
case that content URI will be this Wi-Fi
path based on that we're gonna build a

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:41.990
path based on that we're gonna build a
 

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:44.890
path based on that we're gonna build a
Wi-Fi slice so we'll jump into this

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:44.900
Wi-Fi slice so we'll jump into this
 

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:48.519
Wi-Fi slice so we'll jump into this
method and slices start with list

00:08:48.519 --> 00:08:48.529
method and slices start with list
 

00:08:48.529 --> 00:08:50.769
method and slices start with list
builders so list builder accepts

00:08:50.769 --> 00:08:50.779
builders so list builder accepts
 

00:08:50.779 --> 00:08:52.510
builders so list builder accepts
different kinds of rows of content this

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:52.520
different kinds of rows of content this
 

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:53.770
different kinds of rows of content this
Wi-Fi slice is fairly

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:53.780
Wi-Fi slice is fairly
 

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:56.260
Wi-Fi slice is fairly
well it's a single row and so we first

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:56.270
well it's a single row and so we first
 

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:58.300
well it's a single row and so we first
start with our list builder we build a

00:08:58.300 --> 00:08:58.310
start with our list builder we build a
 

00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:00.610
start with our list builder we build a
row builder based off of it we add the

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:00.620
row builder based off of it we add the
 

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:03.910
row builder based off of it we add the
Wi-Fi title and then we kind of do this

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:03.920
Wi-Fi title and then we kind of do this
 

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.110
Wi-Fi title and then we kind of do this
weird thing where we check if Wi-Fi

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:05.120
weird thing where we check if Wi-Fi
 

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.120
weird thing where we check if Wi-Fi
state is loaded maybe it takes some time

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:07.130
state is loaded maybe it takes some time
 

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:09.430
state is loaded maybe it takes some time
for us to determine whether Wi-Fi is

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:09.440
for us to determine whether Wi-Fi is
 

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.500
for us to determine whether Wi-Fi is
connected or not and we need to do that

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:11.510
connected or not and we need to do that
 

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:14.140
connected or not and we need to do that
in the background in the meantime we're

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:14.150
in the background in the meantime we're
 

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:17.170
in the background in the meantime we're
still going to return a slice with the

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:17.180
still going to return a slice with the
 

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:20.620
still going to return a slice with the
content we intend to display but we kind

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:20.630
content we intend to display but we kind
 

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:24.150
content we intend to display but we kind
of note that this content is loading so

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:24.160
of note that this content is loading so
 

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.920
of note that this content is loading so
the toggle we don't know the state and

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:26.930
the toggle we don't know the state and
 

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:28.720
the toggle we don't know the state and
the connected text we don't know whether

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:28.730
the connected text we don't know whether
 

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:30.130
the connected text we don't know whether
we're connected or not so these two

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:30.140
we're connected or not so these two
 

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:31.870
we're connected or not so these two
pieces we need to indicate they're

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:31.880
pieces we need to indicate they're
 

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.270
pieces we need to indicate they're
thought they're going to be loaded we do

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:34.280
thought they're going to be loaded we do
 

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.100
thought they're going to be loaded we do
that just by passing DeLand Abilene on

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:36.110
that just by passing DeLand Abilene on
 

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:39.430
that just by passing DeLand Abilene on
the Builder methods we then add that row

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:39.440
the Builder methods we then add that row
 

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.740
the Builder methods we then add that row
to the list builder and we build the

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:41.750
to the list builder and we build the
 

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:47.410
to the list builder and we build the
slice so meanwhile our Wi-Fi state has

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:47.420
slice so meanwhile our Wi-Fi state has
 

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:50.410
slice so meanwhile our Wi-Fi state has
been loading maybe when this is done it

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:50.420
been loading maybe when this is done it
 

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:52.750
been loading maybe when this is done it
we get a callback to on Wi-Fi state

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:52.760
we get a callback to on Wi-Fi state
 

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:56.620
we get a callback to on Wi-Fi state
loaded we flip our flag and now we need

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:56.630
loaded we flip our flag and now we need
 

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:59.500
loaded we flip our flag and now we need
to let the UI know to update so our

00:09:59.500 --> 00:09:59.510
to let the UI know to update so our
 

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:01.530
to let the UI know to update so our
Wi-Fi slice is being displayed somewhere

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:01.540
Wi-Fi slice is being displayed somewhere
 

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:05.800
Wi-Fi slice is being displayed somewhere
and it is our sad little loading state

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:05.810
and it is our sad little loading state
 

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:07.660
and it is our sad little loading state
with just the Wi-Fi text so we need to

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:07.670
with just the Wi-Fi text so we need to
 

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:09.100
with just the Wi-Fi text so we need to
let it know to update to get that

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:09.110
let it know to update to get that
 

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:11.320
let it know to update to get that
subtitle string and the toggle action

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:11.330
subtitle string and the toggle action
 

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:13.329
subtitle string and the toggle action
and we do that with the content resolver

00:10:13.329 --> 00:10:13.339
and we do that with the content resolver
 

00:10:13.339 --> 00:10:15.730
and we do that with the content resolver
and notify change on the full content

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:15.740
and notify change on the full content
 

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:19.720
and notify change on the full content
URI for that slice so you'll get a call

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:19.730
URI for that slice so you'll get a call
 

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:21.940
URI for that slice so you'll get a call
to you on by and slice again it'll be

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:21.950
to you on by and slice again it'll be
 

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:25.390
to you on by and slice again it'll be
the same Wi-Fi URI and you'll walk into

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:25.400
the same Wi-Fi URI and you'll walk into
 

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.450
the same Wi-Fi URI and you'll walk into
your build Wi-Fi slice method and this

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:28.460
your build Wi-Fi slice method and this
 

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:31.240
your build Wi-Fi slice method and this
time our Wi-Fi stays loaded so we can

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:31.250
time our Wi-Fi stays loaded so we can
 

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:33.040
time our Wi-Fi stays loaded so we can
check whether we're connected or not it

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:33.050
check whether we're connected or not it
 

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:35.980
check whether we're connected or not it
set that subtitle text and create our

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:35.990
set that subtitle text and create our
 

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:40.300
set that subtitle text and create our
toggle action so this get Wi-Fi toggle

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:40.310
toggle action so this get Wi-Fi toggle
 

00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:42.310
toggle action so this get Wi-Fi toggle
action is going to create a slice action

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:42.320
action is going to create a slice action
 

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:47.320
action is going to create a slice action
this is how we represent actions and

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:47.330
this is how we represent actions and
 

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:49.780
this is how we represent actions and
slices so the slice action basically

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:49.790
slices so the slice action basically
 

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:52.120
slices so the slice action basically
wraps the pending intent and then takes

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:52.130
wraps the pending intent and then takes
 

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:53.890
wraps the pending intent and then takes
some extra information to represent the

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:53.900
some extra information to represent the
 

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:57.790
some extra information to represent the
action in our case we want to respond to

00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:57.800
action in our case we want to respond to
 

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:00.880
action in our case we want to respond to
someone tapping on the toggle so we need

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:00.890
someone tapping on the toggle so we need
 

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:03.760
someone tapping on the toggle so we need
to have a broadcast receiver to receive

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:03.770
to have a broadcast receiver to receive
 

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:05.780
to have a broadcast receiver to receive
that pending intent and

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:05.790
that pending intent and
 

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:09.980
that pending intent and
do some stuff to update Wi-Fi state so

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:09.990
do some stuff to update Wi-Fi state so
 

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:11.180
do some stuff to update Wi-Fi state so
we build our slice action with that

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:11.190
we build our slice action with that
 

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:14.150
we build our slice action with that
intent and a label and describing the

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:14.160
intent and a label and describing the
 

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.370
intent and a label and describing the
action and then a boolean value

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:16.380
action and then a boolean value
 

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:18.980
action and then a boolean value
representing whether this toggle is on

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:18.990
representing whether this toggle is on
 

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:25.040
representing whether this toggle is on
or off so in our case the Wi-Fi state so

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:25.050
or off so in our case the Wi-Fi state so
 

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:26.780
or off so in our case the Wi-Fi state so
when you tap on that Tago that pending

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:26.790
when you tap on that Tago that pending
 

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:29.480
when you tap on that Tago that pending
intent gets sent your but you'll define

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:29.490
intent gets sent your but you'll define
 

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:31.430
intent gets sent your but you'll define
this bar you'll define a broadcast

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:31.440
this bar you'll define a broadcast
 

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.620
this bar you'll define a broadcast
receiver for your app to handle this

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:33.630
receiver for your app to handle this
 

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:37.250
receiver for your app to handle this
intent in our case we need Wi-Fi manager

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:37.260
intent in our case we need Wi-Fi manager
 

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.910
intent in our case we need Wi-Fi manager
to update Wi-Fi State something neat

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:40.920
to update Wi-Fi State something neat
 

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:44.360
to update Wi-Fi State something neat
that slices does four toggles is so if

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:44.370
that slices does four toggles is so if
 

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:47.150
that slices does four toggles is so if
the Wi-Fi was on I tap on that toggle

00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:47.160
the Wi-Fi was on I tap on that toggle
 

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.820
the Wi-Fi was on I tap on that toggle
that pending intent gets sent will

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:49.830
that pending intent gets sent will
 

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:52.160
that pending intent gets sent will
attach the resulting state of the toggle

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:52.170
attach the resulting state of the toggle
 

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:54.770
attach the resulting state of the toggle
this extra toggle state to that intent

00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:54.780
this extra toggle state to that intent
 

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:56.600
this extra toggle state to that intent
so that you can retrieve it and know

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:56.610
so that you can retrieve it and know
 

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:59.830
so that you can retrieve it and know
what the new state of the toggle is

00:11:59.830 --> 00:11:59.840
what the new state of the toggle is
 

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:02.660

00:14:41.399 --> 00:14:43.519
all of your all of the data we need to
present in these different formats we

00:14:43.519 --> 00:14:43.529
present in these different formats we
 

00:14:43.529 --> 00:14:45.920
present in these different formats we
want slices to be able to move across

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:45.930
want slices to be able to move across
 

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:47.600
want slices to be able to move across
the operating system in different spaces

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:47.610
the operating system in different spaces
 

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:50.960
the operating system in different spaces
and they might need to shift their form

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:50.970
and they might need to shift their form
 

00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:53.210
and they might need to shift their form
based on that so we're supporting a

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:53.220
based on that so we're supporting a
 

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:54.949
based on that so we're supporting a
shortcut form which is just a small

00:14:54.949 --> 00:14:54.959
shortcut form which is just a small
 

00:14:54.959 --> 00:14:58.370
shortcut form which is just a small
tappable icon a small slice which is the

00:14:58.370 --> 00:14:58.380
tappable icon a small slice which is the
 

00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:00.530
tappable icon a small slice which is the
first row of your slice generally and

00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:00.540
first row of your slice generally and
 

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:02.689
first row of your slice generally and
then a large slice which is all of the

00:15:02.689 --> 00:15:02.699
then a large slice which is all of the
 

00:15:02.699 --> 00:15:04.730
then a large slice which is all of the
content so when you're building your

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:04.740
content so when you're building your
 

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:06.530
content so when you're building your
slice keep out in mind make sure you

00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:06.540
slice keep out in mind make sure you
 

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:08.120
slice keep out in mind make sure you
test the different modes so that the

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:08.130
test the different modes so that the
 

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:11.449
test the different modes so that the
slice displays how you expect it to in

00:15:11.449 --> 00:15:11.459
slice displays how you expect it to in
 

00:15:11.459 --> 00:15:15.319
slice displays how you expect it to in
these formats things presenting slices

00:15:15.319 --> 00:15:15.329
these formats things presenting slices
 

00:15:15.329 --> 00:15:18.800
these formats things presenting slices
can also customize them so they've got

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:18.810
can also customize them so they've got
 

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:20.870
can also customize them so they've got
some flexibility with increasing font

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:20.880
some flexibility with increasing font
 

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:24.110
some flexibility with increasing font
size changing the font style and maybe

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:24.120
size changing the font style and maybe
 

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:25.939
size changing the font style and maybe
overriding any colors that you set

00:15:25.939 --> 00:15:25.949
overriding any colors that you set
 

00:15:25.949 --> 00:15:27.590
overriding any colors that you set
because we want slices to sort of feel

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:27.600
because we want slices to sort of feel
 

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:28.519
because we want slices to sort of feel
at home

00:15:28.519 --> 00:15:28.529
at home
 

00:15:28.529 --> 00:15:30.349
at home
in the surface that they're being

00:15:30.349 --> 00:15:30.359
in the surface that they're being
 

00:15:30.359 --> 00:15:34.099
in the surface that they're being
presented in so I'm going to walk you

00:15:34.099 --> 00:15:34.109
presented in so I'm going to walk you
 

00:15:34.109 --> 00:15:36.349
presented in so I'm going to walk you
through an example to build this Home

00:15:36.349 --> 00:15:36.359
through an example to build this Home
 

00:15:36.359 --> 00:15:38.449
through an example to build this Home
Slice which allows you to control your

00:15:38.449 --> 00:15:38.459
Slice which allows you to control your
 

00:15:38.459 --> 00:15:41.269
Slice which allows you to control your
temperature and see the many video

00:15:41.269 --> 00:15:41.279
temperature and see the many video
 

00:15:41.279 --> 00:15:45.369
temperature and see the many video
cameras that you might have in your home

00:15:45.369 --> 00:15:45.379
 

00:15:45.379 --> 00:15:49.099
so again starts with a list builder here

00:15:49.099 --> 00:15:49.109
so again starts with a list builder here
 

00:15:49.109 --> 00:15:51.289
so again starts with a list builder here
we're defining to slice actions for

00:15:51.289 --> 00:15:51.299
we're defining to slice actions for
 

00:15:51.299 --> 00:15:52.759
we're defining to slice actions for
turning the temperature up and turning

00:15:52.759 --> 00:15:52.769
turning the temperature up and turning
 

00:15:52.769 --> 00:15:55.279
turning the temperature up and turning
the temperature down these just take a

00:15:55.279 --> 00:15:55.289
the temperature down these just take a
 

00:15:55.289 --> 00:15:58.849
the temperature down these just take a
pending intent icon compat and then a

00:15:58.849 --> 00:15:58.859
pending intent icon compat and then a
 

00:15:58.859 --> 00:16:02.479
pending intent icon compat and then a
label we create our row we set our title

00:16:02.479 --> 00:16:02.489
label we create our row we set our title
 

00:16:02.489 --> 00:16:04.999
label we create our row we set our title
and subtitle add the two actions add the

00:16:04.999 --> 00:16:05.009
and subtitle add the two actions add the
 

00:16:05.009 --> 00:16:08.389
and subtitle add the two actions add the
road to the list and then we've got that

00:16:08.389 --> 00:16:08.399
road to the list and then we've got that
 

00:16:08.399 --> 00:16:11.929
road to the list and then we've got that
top part of the slice so we'll do the

00:16:11.929 --> 00:16:11.939
top part of the slice so we'll do the
 

00:16:11.939 --> 00:16:15.049
top part of the slice so we'll do the
second part now the camera snapshots

00:16:15.049 --> 00:16:15.059
second part now the camera snapshots
 

00:16:15.059 --> 00:16:18.379
second part now the camera snapshots
maybe we'll get our data for this this

00:16:18.379 --> 00:16:18.389
maybe we'll get our data for this this
 

00:16:18.389 --> 00:16:20.629
maybe we'll get our data for this this
is a grid row so we'll build define a

00:16:20.629 --> 00:16:20.639
is a grid row so we'll build define a
 

00:16:20.639 --> 00:16:22.939
is a grid row so we'll build define a
grid row builder and then for each of

00:16:22.939 --> 00:16:22.949
grid row builder and then for each of
 

00:16:22.949 --> 00:16:25.009
grid row builder and then for each of
the data elements we're displaying in

00:16:25.009 --> 00:16:25.019
the data elements we're displaying in
 

00:16:25.019 --> 00:16:27.049
the data elements we're displaying in
these cells we'll add a cell to the grid

00:16:27.049 --> 00:16:27.059
these cells we'll add a cell to the grid
 

00:16:27.059 --> 00:16:28.939
these cells we'll add a cell to the grid
builder and the cell will take an image

00:16:28.939 --> 00:16:28.949
builder and the cell will take an image
 

00:16:28.949 --> 00:16:31.849
builder and the cell will take an image
title text and text and these are

00:16:31.849 --> 00:16:31.859
title text and text and these are
 

00:16:31.859 --> 00:16:33.559
title text and text and these are
displayed in the order that you add them

00:16:33.559 --> 00:16:33.569
displayed in the order that you add them
 

00:16:33.569 --> 00:16:35.239
displayed in the order that you add them
to the cell builder so if you want to

00:16:35.239 --> 00:16:35.249
to the cell builder so if you want to
 

00:16:35.249 --> 00:16:37.429
to the cell builder so if you want to
mix them up they don't need to be image

00:16:37.429 --> 00:16:37.439
mix them up they don't need to be image
 

00:16:37.439 --> 00:16:39.559
mix them up they don't need to be image
text text it could be text image text

00:16:39.559 --> 00:16:39.569
text text it could be text image text
 

00:16:39.569 --> 00:16:43.669
text text it could be text image text
and so again it's flexible add that grid

00:16:43.669 --> 00:16:43.679
and so again it's flexible add that grid
 

00:16:43.679 --> 00:16:45.710
and so again it's flexible add that grid
Road for the list and then you've built

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:45.720
Road for the list and then you've built
 

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:50.239
Road for the list and then you've built
your slice and Jason is going to take it

00:16:50.239 --> 00:16:50.249
your slice and Jason is going to take it
 

00:16:50.249 --> 00:16:52.069
your slice and Jason is going to take it
away to describe how you can get these

00:16:52.069 --> 00:16:52.079
away to describe how you can get these
 

00:16:52.079 --> 00:16:56.029
away to describe how you can get these

Maddy all right so Lake Archer said

00:16:58.129 --> 00:16:58.139
Maddy all right so Lake Archer said
 

00:16:58.139 --> 00:16:59.839
Maddy all right so Lake Archer said
we've got two cases that we're talking

00:16:59.839 --> 00:16:59.849
we've got two cases that we're talking
 

00:16:59.849 --> 00:17:01.969
we've got two cases that we're talking
about for Google search these are both

00:17:01.969 --> 00:17:01.979
about for Google search these are both
 

00:17:01.979 --> 00:17:03.710
about for Google search these are both
showing up in predictions so you know

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:03.720
showing up in predictions so you know
 

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:06.350
showing up in predictions so you know
you can tap on the search bar type a few

00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:06.360
you can tap on the search bar type a few
 

00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:07.460
you can tap on the search bar type a few
characters and the user will be

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:07.470
characters and the user will be
 

00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:09.289
characters and the user will be
interacting with your app basically at

00:17:09.289 --> 00:17:09.299
interacting with your app basically at
 

00:17:09.299 --> 00:17:12.139
interacting with your app basically at
that point one thing to note this is

00:17:12.139 --> 00:17:12.149
that point one thing to note this is
 

00:17:12.149 --> 00:17:13.579
that point one thing to note this is
only for apps installed on your device

only for apps installed on your device
we aren't currently doing anything with

we aren't currently doing anything with
 

00:17:15.179 --> 00:17:17.449
we aren't currently doing anything with
instant apps or stuff from the cloud and

00:17:17.449 --> 00:17:17.459
instant apps or stuff from the cloud and
 

00:17:17.459 --> 00:17:19.069
instant apps or stuff from the cloud and
these next few slides are really just a

00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:19.079
these next few slides are really just a
 

00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:20.539
these next few slides are really just a
preview we're going to be launching all

00:17:20.539 --> 00:17:20.549
preview we're going to be launching all
 

00:17:20.549 --> 00:17:21.859
preview we're going to be launching all
sorts of documentation when we

00:17:21.859 --> 00:17:21.869
sorts of documentation when we
 

00:17:21.869 --> 00:17:23.919
sorts of documentation when we
officially ship this later this summer

00:17:23.919 --> 00:17:23.929
officially ship this later this summer
 

00:17:23.929 --> 00:17:26.029
officially ship this later this summer
all right so let's talk through how you

00:17:26.029 --> 00:17:26.039
all right so let's talk through how you
 

00:17:26.039 --> 00:17:28.009
all right so let's talk through how you
do this for an app name there are two

00:17:28.009 --> 00:17:28.019
do this for an app name there are two
 

00:17:28.019 --> 00:17:29.180
do this for an app name there are two
things you really need to do in this

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:29.190
things you really need to do in this
 

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:31.669
things you really need to do in this
case you need to link of specific slice

00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:31.679
case you need to link of specific slice
 

00:17:31.679 --> 00:17:33.289
case you need to link of specific slice
to your main activity of your app that's

00:17:33.289 --> 00:17:33.299
to your main activity of your app that's
 

00:17:33.299 --> 00:17:34.940
to your main activity of your app that's
the activity that shows up in launcher

00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:34.950
the activity that shows up in launcher
 

00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:38.149
the activity that shows up in launcher
and the activity that the with the name

00:17:38.149 --> 00:17:38.159
and the activity that the with the name
 

00:17:38.159 --> 00:17:40.009
and the activity that the with the name
that users will search for and you need

00:17:40.009 --> 00:17:40.019
that users will search for and you need
 

00:17:40.019 --> 00:17:41.220
that users will search for and you need
to grant some permissions

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:41.230
to grant some permissions
 

00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:43.470
to grant some permissions
so linking the activity is actually

00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:43.480
so linking the activity is actually
 

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:45.419
so linking the activity is actually
really really simple you just add one

00:17:45.419 --> 00:17:45.429
really really simple you just add one
 

00:17:45.429 --> 00:17:48.480
really really simple you just add one
piece of metadata into your manifest and

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:48.490
piece of metadata into your manifest and
 

00:17:48.490 --> 00:17:50.759
piece of metadata into your manifest and
that metadata points at any slice URI

00:17:50.759 --> 00:17:50.769
that metadata points at any slice URI
 

00:17:50.769 --> 00:17:53.610
that metadata points at any slice URI
you want within your app and that's the

00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:53.620
you want within your app and that's the
 

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:55.470
you want within your app and that's the
URI that you can expect to get bound

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:55.480
URI that you can expect to get bound
 

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:56.909
URI that you can expect to get bound
when the users type in the name of your

00:17:56.909 --> 00:17:56.919
when the users type in the name of your
 

00:17:56.919 --> 00:17:59.970
when the users type in the name of your
app you also need to grant these

00:17:59.970 --> 00:17:59.980
app you also need to grant these
 

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:03.269
app you also need to grant these
permissions explicitly to search and

00:18:03.269 --> 00:18:03.279
permissions explicitly to search and
 

00:18:03.279 --> 00:18:05.190
permissions explicitly to search and
Play services so that it has access to

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:05.200
Play services so that it has access to
 

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.049
Play services so that it has access to
read to your slice and display it

00:18:07.049 --> 00:18:07.059
read to your slice and display it
 

00:18:07.059 --> 00:18:09.840
read to your slice and display it
properly we'll talk a bit more about

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:09.850
properly we'll talk a bit more about
 

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:12.149
properly we'll talk a bit more about
permissions and in a little bit but

00:18:12.149 --> 00:18:12.159
permissions and in a little bit but
 

00:18:12.159 --> 00:18:13.440
permissions and in a little bit but
these are basically the lines of code

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:13.450
these are basically the lines of code
 

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:16.649
these are basically the lines of code
you need to do for a default slice or an

00:18:16.649 --> 00:18:16.659
you need to do for a default slice or an
 

00:18:16.659 --> 00:18:20.580
you need to do for a default slice or an
app slice okay so the the bit more broad

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:20.590
app slice okay so the the bit more broad
 

00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:23.610
app slice okay so the the bit more broad
range of general terms this is a little

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:23.620
range of general terms this is a little
 

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:26.970
range of general terms this is a little
bit more complicated the another thing

00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:26.980
bit more complicated the another thing
 

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:28.680
bit more complicated the another thing
to notice that ranking may vary is that

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:28.690
to notice that ranking may vary is that
 

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:29.759
to notice that ranking may vary is that
you know search is going to try to

00:18:29.759 --> 00:18:29.769
you know search is going to try to
 

00:18:29.769 --> 00:18:32.190
you know search is going to try to
present whatever content is best for the

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:32.200
present whatever content is best for the
 

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:34.379
present whatever content is best for the
user and so you can't always guarantee

00:18:34.379 --> 00:18:34.389
user and so you can't always guarantee
 

00:18:34.389 --> 00:18:36.659
user and so you can't always guarantee
that your app is going to be shown but

00:18:36.659 --> 00:18:36.669
that your app is going to be shown but
 

00:18:36.669 --> 00:18:38.340
that your app is going to be shown but
that can be enhanced with a bit of you

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:38.350
that can be enhanced with a bit of you
 

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:40.159
that can be enhanced with a bit of you
know usage reporting and stuff like that

00:18:40.159 --> 00:18:40.169
know usage reporting and stuff like that
 

00:18:40.169 --> 00:18:42.629
know usage reporting and stuff like that
there are a few things you need to do

00:18:42.629 --> 00:18:42.639
there are a few things you need to do
 

00:18:42.639 --> 00:18:44.430
there are a few things you need to do
here this is based on top of firebase

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:44.440
here this is based on top of firebase
 

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:47.250
here this is based on top of firebase
app indexing which is existing api's you

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:47.260
app indexing which is existing api's you
 

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:48.539
app indexing which is existing api's you
can go read about them we've got a link

00:18:48.539 --> 00:18:48.549
can go read about them we've got a link
 

00:18:48.549 --> 00:18:51.299
can go read about them we've got a link
on the next slide and you tie those

00:18:51.299 --> 00:18:51.309
on the next slide and you tie those
 

00:18:51.309 --> 00:18:53.340
on the next slide and you tie those
firebase app indexing content directly

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:53.350
firebase app indexing content directly
 

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:55.830
firebase app indexing content directly
to a slice and so that will let search

00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:55.840
to a slice and so that will let search
 

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:58.620
to a slice and so that will let search
know when it triggers that app indexable

00:18:58.620 --> 00:18:58.630
know when it triggers that app indexable
 

00:18:58.630 --> 00:19:00.509
know when it triggers that app indexable
that it should be showing a slice for

00:19:00.509 --> 00:19:00.519
that it should be showing a slice for
 

00:19:00.519 --> 00:19:04.110
that it should be showing a slice for
that so the way you do that is when you

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:04.120
that so the way you do that is when you
 

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:06.000
that so the way you do that is when you
are pushing your app indexable there is

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:06.010
are pushing your app indexable there is
 

00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:07.889
are pushing your app indexable there is
some metadata you can tag there's new

00:19:07.889 --> 00:19:07.899
some metadata you can tag there's new
 

00:19:07.899 --> 00:19:10.529
some metadata you can tag there's new
api's on app indexing that will be

00:19:10.529 --> 00:19:10.539
api's on app indexing that will be
 

00:19:10.539 --> 00:19:12.389
api's on app indexing that will be
launched with this which will let you

00:19:12.389 --> 00:19:12.399
launched with this which will let you
 

00:19:12.399 --> 00:19:15.810
launched with this which will let you
specify your slice URI another piece of

00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:15.820
specify your slice URI another piece of
 

00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:17.009
specify your slice URI another piece of
this is that there's a little bit of

00:19:17.009 --> 00:19:17.019
this is that there's a little bit of
 

00:19:17.019 --> 00:19:19.110
this is that there's a little bit of
content validation so when you're doing

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:19.120
content validation so when you're doing
 

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:21.330
content validation so when you're doing
app indexing you need to specify a

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:21.340
app indexing you need to specify a
 

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:24.360
app indexing you need to specify a
content URL and that content URL needs

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:24.370
content URL and that content URL needs
 

00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:26.340
content URL and that content URL needs
to map to the same slice that you're

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:26.350
to map to the same slice that you're
 

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:28.139
to map to the same slice that you're
specifying with your app it's just a

00:19:28.139 --> 00:19:28.149
specifying with your app it's just a
 

00:19:28.149 --> 00:19:30.600
specifying with your app it's just a
linking sort of a system to verify that

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:30.610
linking sort of a system to verify that
 

00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:32.310
linking sort of a system to verify that
you've got the right content showing and

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:32.320
you've got the right content showing and
 

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:34.320
you've got the right content showing and
so the way that works is there are two

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:34.330
so the way that works is there are two
 

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:36.000
so the way that works is there are two
things you need to do one is you need to

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:36.010
things you need to do one is you need to
 

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:38.480
things you need to do one is you need to
add an intent filter to your provider

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:38.490
add an intent filter to your provider
 

00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:40.740
add an intent filter to your provider
these have been supported but are rarely

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:40.750
these have been supported but are rarely
 

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:43.740
these have been supported but are rarely
used in android for some time these look

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:43.750
used in android for some time these look
 

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:45.509
used in android for some time these look
very similar to app linking if you're

00:19:45.509 --> 00:19:45.519
very similar to app linking if you're
 

00:19:45.519 --> 00:19:47.100
very similar to app linking if you're
familiar with verified app linking or

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:47.110
familiar with verified app linking or
 

00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:48.360
familiar with verified app linking or
app linking this will look pretty

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:48.370
app linking this will look pretty
 

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:50.549
app linking this will look pretty
similar to you this intent filter is an

00:19:50.549 --> 00:19:50.559
similar to you this intent filter is an
 

00:19:50.559 --> 00:19:51.720
similar to you this intent filter is an

thing you can also do if you don't have

00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:57.370
thing you can also do if you don't have
 

00:19:57.370 --> 00:19:58.950
thing you can also do if you don't have
a plinking set up for your app you can

00:19:58.950 --> 00:19:58.960
a plinking set up for your app you can
 

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.659
a plinking set up for your app you can
do your own URL schemes like in the

00:20:00.659 --> 00:20:00.669
do your own URL schemes like in the
 

00:20:00.669 --> 00:20:01.950
do your own URL schemes like in the
settings app in Android we're doing

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:01.960
settings app in Android we're doing
 

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:04.200

our deep links and that's our URL scheme
the other thing you do is once you've

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:08.590
the other thing you do is once you've
 

00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:11.039
the other thing you do is once you've
added an intent filter for your for your

00:20:11.039 --> 00:20:11.049
added an intent filter for your for your
 

00:20:11.049 --> 00:20:12.840
added an intent filter for your for your
provider you can expect that you're

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:12.850
provider you can expect that you're
 

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:14.549
provider you can expect that you're
going to get calls to on map intent to

00:20:14.549 --> 00:20:14.559
going to get calls to on map intent to
 

00:20:14.559 --> 00:20:17.279
going to get calls to on map intent to
URI this lets your apps say I've got

00:20:17.279 --> 00:20:17.289
URI this lets your apps say I've got
 

00:20:17.289 --> 00:20:19.470
URI this lets your apps say I've got
some intent incoming intent data and

00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:19.480
some intent incoming intent data and
 

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:20.999
some intent incoming intent data and
intents are kind of squishy

00:20:20.999 --> 00:20:21.009
intents are kind of squishy
 

00:20:21.009 --> 00:20:22.980
intents are kind of squishy
you know intents aren't as defined as a

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:22.990
you know intents aren't as defined as a
 

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:25.139
you know intents aren't as defined as a
URI and this gives you the moment to say

00:20:25.139 --> 00:20:25.149
URI and this gives you the moment to say
 

00:20:25.149 --> 00:20:26.700
URI and this gives you the moment to say
like here I'm going to take this intent

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:26.710
like here I'm going to take this intent
 

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:28.080
like here I'm going to take this intent
and I'm going to resolve it to an exact

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:28.090
and I'm going to resolve it to an exact
 

00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:30.210
and I'm going to resolve it to an exact
URI and this is the slice I want to show

00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:30.220
URI and this is the slice I want to show
 

00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:32.940
URI and this is the slice I want to show
and so you can do whatever you want

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:32.950
and so you can do whatever you want
 

00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:34.740
and so you can do whatever you want
within this function to it to determine

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:34.750
within this function to it to determine
 

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:36.930
within this function to it to determine
your path in this case it's just kind of

00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:36.940
your path in this case it's just kind of
 

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:39.180
your path in this case it's just kind of
like taking the data off from the intent

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:39.190
like taking the data off from the intent
 

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:41.399
like taking the data off from the intent
and pushing it over to Authority with

00:20:41.399 --> 00:20:41.409
and pushing it over to Authority with
 

00:20:41.409 --> 00:20:44.100
and pushing it over to Authority with
the which is a slice provider but you

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:44.110
the which is a slice provider but you
 

00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:45.570
the which is a slice provider but you
can you can add your own logic of your

00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:45.580
can you can add your own logic of your
 

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:47.549
can you can add your own logic of your
own kind and that's how you add those

00:20:47.549 --> 00:20:47.559
own kind and that's how you add those
 

00:20:47.559 --> 00:20:50.460
own kind and that's how you add those
all right so that's kind of a whirlwind

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:50.470
all right so that's kind of a whirlwind
 

00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:51.960
all right so that's kind of a whirlwind
tour I know we'll be launching more docs

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:51.970
tour I know we'll be launching more docs
 

00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:53.190
tour I know we'll be launching more docs
with that when we when we officially

00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:53.200
with that when we when we officially
 

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.980
with that when we when we officially
launch research now hopefully your

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:55.990
launch research now hopefully your
 

00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:58.200
launch research now hopefully your
slices are holding all sorts of really

00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:58.210
slices are holding all sorts of really
 

00:20:58.210 --> 00:20:59.999
slices are holding all sorts of really
great content and you don't want to

00:20:59.999 --> 00:21:00.009
great content and you don't want to
 

00:21:00.009 --> 00:21:01.320
great content and you don't want to
expose that content to the world so you

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:01.330
expose that content to the world so you
 

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:02.340
expose that content to the world so you
probably really care about how the

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:02.350
probably really care about how the
 

00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:04.799
probably really care about how the
permissions work here so there are three

00:21:04.799 --> 00:21:04.809
permissions work here so there are three
 

00:21:04.809 --> 00:21:06.330
permissions work here so there are three
ways that an app can get ahold of

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:06.340
ways that an app can get ahold of
 

00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:08.999
ways that an app can get ahold of
permissions for your slice the first is

00:21:08.999 --> 00:21:09.009
permissions for your slice the first is
 

00:21:09.009 --> 00:21:10.590
permissions for your slice the first is
you get fine-grained permission controls

00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:10.600
you get fine-grained permission controls
 

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:11.850
you get fine-grained permission controls
these are very similar to URI

00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:11.860
these are very similar to URI
 

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:13.409
these are very similar to URI
permissions except we designed them to

00:21:13.409 --> 00:21:13.419
permissions except we designed them to
 

00:21:13.419 --> 00:21:15.029
permissions except we designed them to
scale up because we expect people to

00:21:15.029 --> 00:21:15.039
scale up because we expect people to
 

00:21:15.039 --> 00:21:17.909
scale up because we expect people to
have a lot of slices over time these

00:21:17.909 --> 00:21:17.919
have a lot of slices over time these
 

00:21:17.919 --> 00:21:19.409
have a lot of slices over time these
happen automatically for you if you're
