1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,730
The Joe Rogan experience. I had Paulie
Malignaggi, he was at my gym and uh,

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:07,290
then he kind of knew,
he goes, wait a minute,

3
00:00:07,291 --> 00:00:10,980
I just figured out who the fuck you are.
You're the guy. I know. He's freaking out.

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,040
So, so I take that
opportunity to ask him like,

5
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:16,740
I'm just asking them like
some boxing questions.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,720
Next thing I know he's giving me a
boxing lesson. How fucking cool is that?

7
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,950
[inaudible] yes, it was three days
ago. He really going to do that.

8
00:00:22,951 --> 00:00:27,030
Bare knuckle boxer is art. I'm curious.
Yeah, and he's taken it personally. Yeah,

9
00:00:27,031 --> 00:00:29,370
but man,
you don't want to break your hands.

10
00:00:29,371 --> 00:00:30,830
You don't want to get your face cut up.
Like,

11
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:34,000
cause he'd done fighting like boxing
bag. He's like, oh I noticed that.

12
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,340
He looked like he was in shape. He was
like, and he was given people pointers.

13
00:00:38,341 --> 00:00:42,330
He's very, he looks, he seems, I listen
to him a lot on, you know, showtime stuff.

14
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,170
He's cerebral as hell. I mean he
knows the game. He's very smart guy.

15
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:47,960
He doesn't get hit a lot.
No,

16
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:52,170
I mean when you think about a boxer they
can talk as well as he can. Oh, I'm pose.

17
00:00:52,171 --> 00:00:56,250
Articulate as he is and understand.
I mean if you watch him the way he fights,

18
00:00:56,251 --> 00:00:58,270
like watch his fights with
Adrian Broner like he,

19
00:00:58,271 --> 00:01:03,271
he knew how to figure out
the puzzle that's or his
hand speed and power punching

20
00:01:04,321 --> 00:01:07,590
and he punches him volume.
He's always in gray showing me patterns,

21
00:01:07,591 --> 00:01:09,690
like just basic things
that I was like damn,

22
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,790
I really want to see the actual sparring
match between him and Connor cause all

23
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:18,600
the UFC released. Is Connor cracking them?
I know it's a long one. It had to be,

24
00:01:18,601 --> 00:01:22,380
there had to be some fun moments
in that. Yeah. I will also,

25
00:01:22,381 --> 00:01:27,090
I think apparently Pauley got
off a plane and then he hadn't,

26
00:01:27,091 --> 00:01:27,924
it wasn't even really,

27
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,630
he wasn't even working out that much
then they thought it was going to train

28
00:01:30,631 --> 00:01:33,480
with them. Yeah. And they go, we're
going six rounds or something.

29
00:01:33,481 --> 00:01:37,250
He was filming what you film
it. Yeah. That's something,

30
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,220
they use it as a promo. Right.
People are ruthless bro.

31
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,030
The idea that they weren't gonna use.
That is more ridiculous. Come on. Wait,

32
00:01:45,031 --> 00:01:48,720
who are you? You don't understand how
this business works. They're promoting,

33
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:53,070
they're promoting of, he's a Brooklyn
Kid. He's a smart guy. Listen,

34
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,870
they're promoting a fight that is going
to generate hundreds of millions of

35
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:02,220
dollars in revenue. You think that
they're going to spare your sensibilities,

36
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:07,140
they're going to spare your feelings and
not show edited versions of you getting

37
00:02:07,141 --> 00:02:09,260
popped.
But my problem is so the,

38
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,570
I have a problem with that
all across the board because?

39
00:02:12,571 --> 00:02:16,590
Because I feel like when common decency,

40
00:02:16,591 --> 00:02:21,530
fair play, you know a contract and
ed sort of a contract, you enter,

41
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:24,420
I'm coming out to help you out and
what you're going to do is use me,

42
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,490
go fuck yourself. Like it's not believing
it's, I understand. I understand.

43
00:02:29,491 --> 00:02:30,960
It's a business leave.
They paid him.

44
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:35,610
I'm sure they did and I believe he
signed paperwork over. I'm sure they did,

45
00:02:35,611 --> 00:02:39,990
but that's a sneaky move. It's fucked
yet and I and I have a problem with it.

46
00:02:39,991 --> 00:02:41,070
Fuck yes.
In general,

47
00:02:41,071 --> 00:02:44,980
I just don't like justifying
anything because it's going
to be good promotion. I,

48
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:49,650
I'm always uneasy. You know how
people say, ah hey man, bad press.

49
00:02:49,651 --> 00:02:54,330
But you're talking about him. Yeah, but
fuck off. I completely agree with you.

50
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,490
However,
I pulled to play devil's advocate.

51
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,620
If I'm Mr businessman mister money bags,

52
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,810
that shit just went in
one ear and out the other.

53
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:01,900
I don't know what you're talking about.

54
00:03:01,901 --> 00:03:05,530
That's a video of some shit that actually
happened. You hate. The truth is if you,

55
00:03:05,531 --> 00:03:06,550
if you hate the truth,

56
00:03:06,551 --> 00:03:08,720
I can understand why you would want
to show them that video. Right?

57
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:11,950
But Conor did drop him with the left
hand and it's going to be a great fight.

58
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:16,900
Conor McGregor versus Floyd Mayweather
and ironically it might've been good for

59
00:03:16,901 --> 00:03:21,540
Pauli in terms of it creating
this fight with art traits.

60
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,500
You're talking about them all,
I think.

61
00:03:23,501 --> 00:03:27,280
I think polyman analogies stands on his
own. Not only has a boxing announcer.

62
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:31,800
Yeah, I mean he's, he's got a real name
and he's a, he's an excellent boxer. It's,

63
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,300
he's probably one of the better
commentators in the game, if not the best.

64
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,180
Oh yeah. Very, very good.
100% him and Andre Ward,

65
00:03:37,181 --> 00:03:40,440
Andre Ward from the favorite and
Roy Jones Jr for Rachel's juniors.

66
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,070
Outstanding at it too. Yeah, he
is just brilliant. Brilliant guy.

67
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,620
Brilliant guy. I just watching him
like figure out Kovalev too. Right?

68
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:53,350
Especially in the second
fight. Unbelievable. Yeah.
In fact that, you know,

69
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:56,980
he dropped Covello with
a body shot and you know,

70
00:03:56,981 --> 00:04:00,370
Coppola so that the didn't give him a
chance and that they just stopped the

71
00:04:00,371 --> 00:04:02,620
fight, but it didn't look
like he wanted to keep going.

72
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:06,850
I felt like that way with Amir Khan, like
if people are like, oh listen to them,

73
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,360
come here, con has nothing
approved. He has an amazing record.

74
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:15,570
He's fighting a genius in
Crawford and probably in,

75
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:19,840
there's no shame in this. He
was supposed to fight, um,

76
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:24,410
Kell Brooks and he kind of went,
you know what, this guy is. He,

77
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:28,060
he's time is on his side and he's going
to, he's kind of figured this out.

78
00:04:28,061 --> 00:04:30,290
He's bigger and he's going to kidnap.

79
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,320
He's going to hit me
and maybe hurt me here.

80
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:35,710
I don't feel like doing this anymore.
If that was the case,

81
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,700
I forgive him for everything.

82
00:04:36,701 --> 00:04:40,210
It's like I thought it was
a smart decision to find
her and maybe he was really

83
00:04:40,211 --> 00:04:42,430
hard. He's killed the kettle.
I'm not saying he's not,

84
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,430
but the Kell Brook fight would have
actually gotten Amir Khan more money.

85
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:49,150
It was a actually wanting to test
himself and he decided to take the fight

86
00:04:49,151 --> 00:04:50,320
against Crawford's real fighter.

87
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:53,410
If Crawford's not the best pound for
pound fighter on earth. He's number two.

88
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:56,230
He's one or two. I want to see
him. What else? Or I'll spends,

89
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:58,360
well him Earl Spencer is fantastic too,

90
00:04:58,361 --> 00:05:02,440
but I think the argument of pound
for pound is Loma Chanko in him.

91
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:06,550
Does the argument, you mean two guys
were number one? Yeah. I'm like,

92
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,740
who do you think is number
one? I mean, I think spreads.

93
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,110
You're talking about Crawford,
Crawford.

94
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,450
I don't know if they'll
follow them in Toronto.

95
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:16,810
I don't think Crawford's
fought enough competition.

96
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,690
Like when he fights Earl Spence and the,

97
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:24,980
I think that Lowman Chenko has probably
had more fights and you can really get

98
00:05:25,931 --> 00:05:30,640
into this conversation cause he hasn't
everybody but he said as had he won the

99
00:05:30,641 --> 00:05:34,960
world title would like four
fights. I, yeah, how many fights?

100
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:36,790
It was like something
ridiculous like that.

101
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:40,200
I mean he fought a world class
fighters first time out the,

102
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:45,140
when I saw him fight a Jorge, um, what
was that amazing Mexican fighter? Uh,

103
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,630
or some are like that.

104
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:51,730
Who is the guy who follows record here
is 13 and one in Crawford's 35 now. Yeah.

105
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:55,330
Wow. Big Difference. But, but boxing
is tricky that way. Right. So what's,

106
00:05:55,331 --> 00:05:58,130
what's the level of competition
as they bring you up slow? Well,

107
00:05:58,131 --> 00:06:01,640
the difference is Loma Chanko had
an extensive amateur background

108
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,740
internationally, but soda, Crawford,

109
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:06,110
Crawford had a great amateur
background to look Crawford.

110
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,290
The differences Crawford's way bigger.
That's the difference.

111
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:12,110
If there were the same size,
it'd be really interesting
to see what would happen.

112
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,290
But Crawford's a lot bigger than
him. He would. Yeah. I mean,

113
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,090
it's not a good fine now it's just,

114
00:06:17,091 --> 00:06:21,350
I still watch him take rig and Dow and
all these amazing fighters were gone.

115
00:06:21,351 --> 00:06:24,470
Dio [inaudible] I thought it was
Reagan now. I don't think so.

116
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:30,220
I think that's it in French and he gained
do Rigondeaux if he game Gumdale um,

117
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:34,730
but yeah, he did. He just manels
people. His footwork is unparalleled.

118
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:37,100
But Terrence Crawford men,
first of all,

119
00:06:37,101 --> 00:06:40,940
he's probably the best switch
hitter ever next to Marvin Hagler.

120
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,990
He might be better. Yeah.
I mean it's hard to say.

121
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,120
Maybe he can find you a game plan
for that. I do so good orthodox then.

122
00:06:47,121 --> 00:06:51,680
So good south paw, but to watch
Linaris that's it Jorge, that nurse,

123
00:06:51,681 --> 00:06:56,030
I think it's sick fighter and to watch
him, he knocked Lemon Chenko down.

124
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:59,630
But then again, like this guy
figures you out. He just, he goes,

125
00:06:59,631 --> 00:07:03,000
I know what you're doing now and then
you're done. We'll sodas. Crawford. Yeah,

126
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:05,600
I mean the the best. I mean that was
an interest in sylvan is prime to,

127
00:07:05,601 --> 00:07:08,870
he would just figure out
your timing. Yeah. Figure out
what you do, how you enter,

128
00:07:08,871 --> 00:07:12,350
where the gaps are, where the holes
are. Okay, I see a key to the castle.

129
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:16,340
Let's rock. Right? And then
somewhere around the end of
the first round Anderson,

130
00:07:16,341 --> 00:07:20,210
we start switching stances on you and
fucking doing some Bruce Lee moves.

131
00:07:20,211 --> 00:07:22,640
And the next thing you know, he's got his
foot in your face. Yeah, that's right.

132
00:07:22,641 --> 00:07:25,960
It's figures you out. It's exactly
right. These guys are just the, the,

133
00:07:25,961 --> 00:07:28,190
a really elite of the elite fighters.

134
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:32,810
They're just the best at
solving the little riddle.
That is what your skills are.

135
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,850
Now, how do you solve that
riddle that is never back.

136
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:40,310
That's a different riddle because that
motherfucker's not on the outside boxing

137
00:07:40,311 --> 00:07:45,260
you. And he caught her Connor
Franta while Connor for a while.

138
00:07:45,261 --> 00:07:46,490
You know,
he's going to take you down.

139
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:49,910
But what it looked like Konner
for a while was isolating.

140
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,350
He had two hands on that wrist.

141
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:56,480
He was stopping him for a long
time from closing his, his hands.

142
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:01,430
And, and that seemed kind of effective
for awhile. I mean, good luck.

143
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:05,070
It's a long road. That's like saying, um,

144
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:09,080
you're running a marathon. Hey, you
know he beat me in the marathon,

145
00:08:09,081 --> 00:08:11,960
but for the first hundred
yards I was way ahead. I know.

146
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,570
That's what it's like cause it
doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.

147
00:08:14,571 --> 00:08:17,990
It's a five round fight like okay,
keeping me from grabbing my hands for now.

148
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:22,190
Write your hands tired yet. Yeah,
how you formed. I'm taking it down.

149
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:23,690
Just going to take it down.

150
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:29,020
That guy is so relentless and the
skill level and the endurance level,

151
00:08:29,151 --> 00:08:32,150
he has to pursue that
pace for five rounds.

152
00:08:32,151 --> 00:08:35,120
Like I don't think I even appreciate it.

153
00:08:35,121 --> 00:08:38,000
I mean I can intellectualize
it and I could describe it,

154
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,580
but I think when you're in there with him,

155
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:44,330
like when he fought Edson Barboza and he
had Edson Barboza up against the cage.

156
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,550
Come on buddy. His mind
give up. Edson has this. No,

157
00:08:46,551 --> 00:08:51,110
that was against Michael Johnson antenes
as this thousand yard stare where where

158
00:08:51,111 --> 00:08:55,340
he's getting mauled. It's just like
he's like breathing. He's like, Oh fuck.

159
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:59,790
Like this is, this is a different kind
of human being. Those Russians are it.

160
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:03,900
That's a different kind of human being
so tight and they grow up fighting from

161
00:09:03,901 --> 00:09:08,220
the Zip. Tommy's a baby. Yes. He's
a sad that culture. They were,

162
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,790
they suffer a great deal. That's
the look. He's like Jesus Christ.

163
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,890
What the fuck did I sign up for?
Skin mauled and I love,

164
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:19,910
I love [inaudible]. It looks like his
legs. His body looks like, you know,

165
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:23,790
guys see at the pool kind of works
out maybe a little. It just doesn't,

166
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:28,110
it looks pretty fit. I don't know.
Talking, I don't know. That guy looks fit.

167
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,490
Barboza is really muscular.
He was jacked man.

168
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:36,190
He's just using Shope photo of cubby
like making like a most muscular poles or

169
00:09:36,301 --> 00:09:40,770
something. Yeah, he's fucking pretty Jack.
He's just not though. He's just a freak.

170
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,430
No, not compared to a lot of dudes. Yeah,
go down there. Look at that. You know,

171
00:09:44,431 --> 00:09:48,030
cause he's dude, what are you talking
about? His jacket not, you know,

172
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:52,530
he looks like a really strong grappler.
He's got, he's, we know he is,

173
00:09:52,531 --> 00:09:56,670
but really look at him like shut your
mouth and it's pretty good there.

174
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:01,350
Shut your turn. You're dirty. Lie
spilling. He's got. It's pretty good.

175
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:04,890
What about that one right there? How about
that one? Cut The shit out of shadows.

176
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,950
Let's go. You look like that. When you,

177
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:10,070
when you were on center TRT about when
you were young and that's what you

178
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:13,040
reflect. It's basically the
same. If I was in there it would,

179
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:15,810
you would call it steroids. You
were always like that. Yeah,

180
00:10:15,811 --> 00:10:19,020
I was always like that. Yeah. When
I was going to be more muscular.

181
00:10:19,021 --> 00:10:21,990
Actually when I first met you
that I didn't even take vitamins.

182
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,250
Now you are just jacked.

183
00:10:23,251 --> 00:10:26,100
I remember first time I heard mad
TV you were jacked out of your mind.

184
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,840
I knew it was just cause
you lifted weights.

185
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,120
Well that was when I was
just getting into Jujitsu.

186
00:10:30,121 --> 00:10:33,030
So I really started lifting weights heavy
cause I was tired of getting mauled.

187
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,150
Yeah. So I really got into lifting
website. I am weak. I'm like,

188
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:37,590
yeah cause I'm used to striking.

189
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:41,460
Striking is so different than grandpa
and different in terms of the demands on

190
00:10:41,461 --> 00:10:43,630
your muscles and your
fatigue. Yeah, it's soap,

191
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:48,270
but it works the other way too because I
remember I had done any striking at all

192
00:10:48,271 --> 00:10:52,650
and like a year, like I had done
none, zero just Jujitsu. And then, um,

193
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,660
my friend Jamie and I started
doing, um, Jamie, um, is a, um,

194
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:01,350
a trainer and we were doing
this a training session
and he had me hit mits too.

195
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:04,770
And like just hitting myths for like
a couple of minutes. I was gassed out.

196
00:11:04,771 --> 00:11:09,300
I was like, how is this possible? I roll
all the time. I'm in good shape right now.

197
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:13,800
That way when we get guys
who are triathlon leads or
whatever, they come in and,

198
00:11:13,801 --> 00:11:18,660
uh, Wayne McCullough shout out
to the great way. Mcculloch
my trainer, I love, um,

199
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,790
I love that guy. He's the best. I fucking,

200
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,620
that's one of my favorite
people in the world.

201
00:11:22,621 --> 00:11:25,830
Like whenever I see them all is right
in the world and he's just a humble man,

202
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:30,840
silver medalist in the Olympics world
champion and nobody asks them questions in

203
00:11:30,841 --> 00:11:33,330
the gym.
It's like he that you had this gold mine,

204
00:11:33,331 --> 00:11:35,370
this guy here who's food beat Morales,

205
00:11:35,371 --> 00:11:38,610
who fought Prince Naseem to the
distance and nobody knows it.

206
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:42,300
And he never tells anybody. And I'll see
these guys hitting. And I'm like, wait,

207
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:44,430
why don't you tell them? And he
goes, they don't ask me. I don't,

208
00:11:44,431 --> 00:11:47,640
I don't bother them. He's just
the most humble dude. We're like,

209
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:52,530
it drives me fucking nuts, but launch.
But anyway, we'll get like triathletes,

210
00:11:52,531 --> 00:11:54,220
people who are in really good shape.
But if you,

211
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:57,310
if you're sparring and you're afraid
to get hit, you stop breathing.

212
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:01,450
And so in three minutes, in two minutes,
I don't care how good a shape you're in,

213
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,710
the minute you get punched once you're
like, yeah, it took me literally,

214
00:12:05,711 --> 00:12:07,990
it probably took me three years
to get over that in a way.

215
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:11,070
Cause I have no confidence
as a boxer and I shouldn't.

216
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:11,720
Okay.
