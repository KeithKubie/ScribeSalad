00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.190
Before you take the Grand Central red
pill, there's something you must know.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.770
Something about closures.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.510
There are a few things about
closures that we skipped

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.640
in the Swift syntax lesson, because
they were not relevant at that point.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.150
Now we need them.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.130
So take your red pill, and

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.910
by the end of this lesson you will
have total control over closures.
