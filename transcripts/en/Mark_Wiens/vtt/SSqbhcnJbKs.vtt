00:00:00.013 --> 00:00:02.708
- I had this idea that if
we come to the fish market,

00:00:02.708 --> 00:00:04.951
if we could find somebody to,

00:00:04.951 --> 00:00:07.072
if we could buy some fish
or something interesting

00:00:07.072 --> 00:00:08.810
and have somebody cook it for us,

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:13.475
this would be the ultimate fish
market experience in Sichon.

00:00:13.475 --> 00:00:16.058
(reggae music)

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.719
Good morning everyone it's Mark Wiens.

00:00:20.719 --> 00:00:24.242
I am in Sichon, in Southern
Thailand, Nakhon Si Thammarat.

00:00:24.242 --> 00:00:26.067
(speaking in foreign language)

00:00:26.067 --> 00:00:29.833
This morning we are at
a very local fish market

00:00:29.833 --> 00:00:32.302
which is right next to the ocean.

00:00:32.302 --> 00:00:35.181
And we're here to just walk
around and see what we can find.

00:00:35.181 --> 00:00:36.138
I'm loving it.

00:00:36.138 --> 00:00:37.721
We got here at about seven,

00:00:37.721 --> 00:00:40.075
it's about 7:30 a.m. and we were--

00:00:40.075 --> 00:00:41.109
- [Ying] Is that one boat coming?

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:42.904
- Oh have a boat coming right now.

00:00:42.904 --> 00:00:45.148
Okay we got here about 7 a.m. and we,

00:00:45.148 --> 00:00:47.451
I was almost disappointed
because all the trays are empty.

00:00:47.451 --> 00:00:49.471
We thought they are cleaning up already.

00:00:49.471 --> 00:00:52.510
But they have just told us,
an auntie has just told us

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.400
that the fish haven't arrived yet.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.776
So they'll be coming in
about 30 minutes hopefully.

00:00:56.776 --> 00:00:58.281
So we're here a perfect time.

00:00:58.281 --> 00:01:01.175
This has to be one of the
most picturesque markets

00:01:01.175 --> 00:01:03.003
I've ever been to in my life.

00:01:03.003 --> 00:01:07.655
It is right next to the ocean,
just a friendly atmosphere,

00:01:07.655 --> 00:01:10.497
just all local fishermen, the coconuts.

00:01:10.497 --> 00:01:13.080
(reggae music)

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:21.807
How it works is that the
boats come up in the morning

00:01:21.807 --> 00:01:24.956
and sometimes the family members will then

00:01:24.956 --> 00:01:26.746
sell the fish from the fishermen.

00:01:26.746 --> 00:01:29.526
And other times some of
the ladies at the market

00:01:29.526 --> 00:01:31.135
they will come here and
buy some of the fish

00:01:31.135 --> 00:01:33.253
and then resell them at the market.

00:01:33.253 --> 00:01:35.979
And this is the first
boat in this morning.

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:38.392
They have a little
selection of different fish

00:01:38.392 --> 00:01:40.272
and some crabs in there.

00:01:40.272 --> 00:01:42.391
(woman shouting in foreign language)

00:01:42.391 --> 00:01:43.957
I'll have some Patongko, one.

00:01:43.957 --> 00:01:45.107
(woman speaks in foreign language)

00:01:45.107 --> 00:01:46.198
Yeah.

00:01:46.198 --> 00:01:49.285
(speaks in foreign language)

00:01:49.285 --> 00:01:51.471
As we're waiting for the main
bulk of the fish to arrive,

00:01:51.471 --> 00:01:53.889
we're gonna have some
snacks for breakfast today.

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:55.766
One of the classic
Thai-Chinese street snacks

00:01:55.766 --> 00:01:57.247
to eat in the morning is Patongko

00:01:57.247 --> 00:02:00.001
which are the fried donuts, savory donuts.

00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:02.418
Grab a little bite like this.

00:02:05.665 --> 00:02:07.310
Yeah, hot and fresh.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.078
You got to eat them hot and fresh.

00:02:09.078 --> 00:02:11.706
If they're like cold and
stale, they're not very good.

00:02:11.706 --> 00:02:14.768
One of my favorite sweet
Thai dessert snacks

00:02:14.768 --> 00:02:16.402
is called Khanom krok.

00:02:16.402 --> 00:02:19.759
And they are making an
amazing version over here.

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:21.518
Really old style.

00:02:21.518 --> 00:02:23.540
(speaks in foreign language)

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.716
You gotta, (speaks in foreign language)

00:02:25.716 --> 00:02:28.142
This is by far the coolest Khanom krok

00:02:28.142 --> 00:02:29.605
that I've ever seen in Thailand.

00:02:29.605 --> 00:02:33.010
Her technique is amazing
and this is a ancient,

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.306
old, old style of making Khanom krok.

00:02:35.306 --> 00:02:38.943
You got that really, the
piece of the iron griddle

00:02:38.943 --> 00:02:41.158
and then she's adding in
the different mixtures

00:02:41.158 --> 00:02:44.247
and even her spoon with the bamboo,

00:02:44.247 --> 00:02:46.726
it's a piece of bamboo
made into a little spoon

00:02:46.726 --> 00:02:48.915
where she dips in and then adds

00:02:48.915 --> 00:02:52.270
that coconut milk to the little cakes.

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.222
It's awesome, absolutely
awesome and they're so friendly.

00:02:56.222 --> 00:02:58.286
I've just been asking them
about their Khanom krok,

00:02:58.286 --> 00:03:00.776
they don't add sugar but
it's just coconut milk.

00:03:00.776 --> 00:03:05.429
There's two layers, the first
liquid batter is coconut milk

00:03:05.429 --> 00:03:06.633
and a little bit of rice flour

00:03:06.633 --> 00:03:07.630
and that's what holds it together.

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.808
And then the top layer of liquid
is just pure coconut milk.

00:03:10.808 --> 00:03:12.455
Sometimes you'll see on
the streets of Thailand,

00:03:12.455 --> 00:03:15.988
you'll see that they use a
lot of oil to oil the griddle

00:03:15.988 --> 00:03:18.672
before they put in the
batter so it doesn't stick.

00:03:18.672 --> 00:03:20.716
They say they don't use any oil

00:03:20.716 --> 00:03:22.837
because they don't need oil
because of the coconut milk.

00:03:22.837 --> 00:03:24.770
It's just all coconut milk,
it's so much coconut milk

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.572
that they don't need,
they don't even need oil.

00:03:26.572 --> 00:03:28.061
And they make them into little cup shapes

00:03:28.061 --> 00:03:30.176
and then they put them together as two.

00:03:30.176 --> 00:03:31.780
So a little twin.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.680
And normally you can, let me
find one that's really hot.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.773
Oh yeah, this one feels like
it's right off the fire.

00:03:36.773 --> 00:03:39.109
Look at that, if you can get
a really close-up look at that

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:41.668
you can just see how that's just like,

00:03:41.668 --> 00:03:44.751
like thickened, reduced coconut milk.

00:03:52.668 --> 00:03:54.684
Oh that's amazing.

00:03:54.684 --> 00:03:56.623
Oh I think that's the best
Khanom krok I've ever had.

00:03:56.623 --> 00:03:57.638
There's no sugar in it.

00:03:57.638 --> 00:03:59.548
They give you a little packet
of sugar to eat on the side.

00:03:59.548 --> 00:04:01.304
You can either pour it
on or you can just eat it

00:04:01.304 --> 00:04:02.668
with no sugar and just rely on

00:04:02.668 --> 00:04:06.109
that coconut milk for the sweetness.

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:08.484
The coconut milk itself has
a little bit of a sweetness,

00:04:08.484 --> 00:04:09.442
it's also a little bit salty.

00:04:09.442 --> 00:04:10.828
They've added some salt to the recipe

00:04:10.828 --> 00:04:14.965
to add contrast and that just
kinda increases the flavor

00:04:14.965 --> 00:04:16.270
of the coconut.

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:19.520
It amplifies the flavor of the coconut.

00:04:21.033 --> 00:04:22.921
That's like coconut pudding

00:04:22.921 --> 00:04:25.421
within a crunchy, smoky shell.

00:04:27.621 --> 00:04:28.673
Outrageously good.

00:04:28.673 --> 00:04:30.251
Here comes another boat in from the sea

00:04:30.251 --> 00:04:32.954
and this is like a chain pulley device.

00:04:32.954 --> 00:04:35.195
There's actually a motor
there to pull the boat in

00:04:35.195 --> 00:04:36.773
from the ocean and unto the bank.

00:04:36.773 --> 00:04:40.356
That looks like it's
been used a few times.

00:04:45.198 --> 00:04:47.781
(reggae music)

00:04:51.536 --> 00:04:53.316
(speaking in foreign language)

00:04:53.316 --> 00:04:55.919
More and more of the
fishing boats are arriving

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:59.121
but we got hung up on
eating all those snacks

00:04:59.121 --> 00:05:00.888
'cause they are so friendly and so nice

00:05:00.888 --> 00:05:03.349
and just invited us to sit down and eat.

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:05.227
Today, for unpredictable reasons,

00:05:05.227 --> 00:05:07.432
was honestly not the best catch.

00:05:07.432 --> 00:05:10.589
Most of the local fishermen
only caught small fish,

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:14.065
handfuls of mackerel, and
a few crabs mixed within.

00:05:14.065 --> 00:05:16.575
But part of the beauty of
visiting this local fish market

00:05:16.575 --> 00:05:19.591
in Thailand is that it
isn't at all commercialized.

00:05:19.591 --> 00:05:21.928
The fishermen are all from this village

00:05:21.928 --> 00:05:23.544
and their catch isn't transported

00:05:23.544 --> 00:05:26.531
to a bigger city or
sold at a bigger market.

00:05:26.531 --> 00:05:29.074
But everything that's caught is sold

00:05:29.074 --> 00:05:33.157
and consumed right within
this fishing community.

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:38.467
Oh Pla lai.

00:05:40.967 --> 00:05:45.050
(conversing in foreign language)

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:50.661
We're trying to sort of talk
to some of the aunties here

00:05:50.661 --> 00:05:53.963
and see if anyone will cook for us.

00:05:53.963 --> 00:05:54.796
Hello.
- [Man] What is your name?

00:05:54.796 --> 00:05:55.629
- Mark.

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:56.462
- What is your name?
- Mark.

00:05:56.462 --> 00:05:58.206
- Mark.
- Yes.

00:05:58.206 --> 00:06:00.272
What is your name?

00:06:00.272 --> 00:06:01.457
- Dahot.

00:06:01.457 --> 00:06:03.679
- Nice to meet you.

00:06:03.679 --> 00:06:06.346
(hip hop music)

00:06:07.825 --> 00:06:10.076
I just ended up on the
back of a motor bike

00:06:10.076 --> 00:06:13.484
and we are going over to
auntie's house to cook some eel.

00:06:13.484 --> 00:06:17.082
(speaking in foreign language)

00:06:17.082 --> 00:06:19.749
(hip hop music)

00:06:40.001 --> 00:06:41.240
- Try.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.297
Try.
- Try, try.

00:06:43.297 --> 00:06:46.661
(speaks in foreign language)

00:06:46.661 --> 00:06:48.736
Let me just quickly
tell you what happened.

00:06:48.736 --> 00:06:51.357
I don't even know if I can
explain the whole story.

00:06:51.357 --> 00:06:55.612
But we're at the market, and
we actually started talking

00:06:55.612 --> 00:06:58.338
with auntie who was selling eels.

00:06:58.338 --> 00:07:00.388
I was just asking her how she cooked it

00:07:00.388 --> 00:07:03.592
and she said, mix Pad
Phet, which is a stir-fry

00:07:03.592 --> 00:07:06.126
with chili paste and lots of chilies.

00:07:06.126 --> 00:07:08.739
And then we just kinda asked her

00:07:08.739 --> 00:07:11.016
or Ying talks to her and all of a sudden,

00:07:11.016 --> 00:07:12.529
I was on the back of a motorcycle

00:07:12.529 --> 00:07:14.238
on the way back to her place

00:07:14.238 --> 00:07:17.683
and she's making a dish
called Pla lai Pad Phet,

00:07:17.683 --> 00:07:20.636
which is eel stir-fried
with all the chili paste in.

00:07:20.636 --> 00:07:22.553
I can't wait to try it.

00:07:27.156 --> 00:07:29.281
Cutting up the eel is a real art.

00:07:29.281 --> 00:07:31.404
But she is doing it so expertly.

00:07:31.404 --> 00:07:33.209
You have to cut out that big, thick bone

00:07:33.209 --> 00:07:35.889
and then she's navigating
her way around it

00:07:35.889 --> 00:07:37.543
and slicing the meat and then cutting it

00:07:37.543 --> 00:07:39.436
into pretty small pieces.

00:07:39.436 --> 00:07:43.441
But you can tell that she has
done this many, many times.

00:07:43.441 --> 00:07:45.094
At this house they're also making kapi,

00:07:45.094 --> 00:07:46.927
which is shrimp paste.

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:49.069
It's fresh shrimp paste that they're,

00:07:49.069 --> 00:07:52.196
well, it's not fresh
because it has to leaven,

00:07:52.196 --> 00:07:54.695
sort of ferment, to make it shrimp paste.

00:07:54.695 --> 00:07:56.088
But they're making it right at home.

00:07:56.088 --> 00:07:57.742
So this is homemade shrimp paste

00:07:57.742 --> 00:08:00.131
and she's gonna include
some of it in the recipe

00:08:00.131 --> 00:08:02.714
that she's making with the eel.

00:08:13.746 --> 00:08:14.814
To make the spicy eel,

00:08:14.814 --> 00:08:17.494
she first sauteed a bunch
of garlic in some hot oil

00:08:17.494 --> 00:08:19.499
and then added in a heap of curry paste

00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:21.825
which she had already
mixed with shrimp paste.

00:08:21.825 --> 00:08:23.174
And let that sizzle in the oil

00:08:23.174 --> 00:08:25.662
to release a massive amount of flavor.

00:08:25.662 --> 00:08:28.173
She then tossed in the
chopped up pieces of eel

00:08:28.173 --> 00:08:31.014
and stir-fried it until
all of the eel was coated

00:08:31.014 --> 00:08:33.014
in luscious curry sauce.

00:08:36.148 --> 00:08:40.065
(speaking in foreign language)

00:08:47.914 --> 00:08:50.637
Finally, a good handful of fresh chilies,

00:08:50.637 --> 00:08:52.311
some young green peppercorns,

00:08:52.311 --> 00:08:54.496
and plenty of fresh holy basil,

00:08:54.496 --> 00:08:57.167
all of which were picked
from right outside the house,

00:08:57.167 --> 00:08:58.500
finished it off.

00:09:00.498 --> 00:09:04.415
(speaking in foreign language)

00:09:08.554 --> 00:09:10.732
The eel is finished and it's stir-fried.

00:09:10.732 --> 00:09:13.674
They added in more chilies
and some green pepper.

00:09:13.674 --> 00:09:17.841
And this is a piece, a little
piece of the eel, the meat.

00:09:20.082 --> 00:09:20.915
Wow!

00:09:22.522 --> 00:09:24.911
(speaks in foreign language)

00:09:24.911 --> 00:09:26.407
That's delicious.

00:09:26.407 --> 00:09:29.057
Eel is just so buttery
and melt in your mouth.

00:09:29.057 --> 00:09:32.900
And then that's just coated
in so much curry paste

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:35.428
and shrimp paste, you can
taste the shrimp paste nicely.

00:09:35.428 --> 00:09:36.553
And that's awesome that they make

00:09:36.553 --> 00:09:38.363
the shrimp paste right here at home.

00:09:38.363 --> 00:09:40.302
And that's spicy.

00:09:40.302 --> 00:09:41.135
Oh that's good.

00:09:41.135 --> 00:09:42.885
She's packing it now.

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:45.243
Into bags.

00:09:45.243 --> 00:09:49.239
And we're gonna head
back to the fish market.

00:09:49.239 --> 00:09:51.891
(reggae music)

00:09:51.891 --> 00:09:54.476
I got my bags full of Pla lai.

00:09:54.476 --> 00:09:58.517
The eel and they're gonna show
me some more eels back here.

00:09:58.517 --> 00:10:02.434
(speaking in foreign language)

00:10:13.773 --> 00:10:16.149
(Mark laughs)

00:10:16.149 --> 00:10:19.899
(speaks in foreign language)

00:10:38.094 --> 00:10:38.927
Bye bye!

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.436
Bye bye!

00:10:44.436 --> 00:10:46.103
- Bye bye!
- Bye bye!

00:10:48.799 --> 00:10:51.849
- And we are off with a bag of eel.

00:10:51.849 --> 00:10:54.432
(reggae music)

00:11:03.058 --> 00:11:05.647
For the fish market, today
there wasn't a lot of big fish.

00:11:05.647 --> 00:11:08.004
It was mostly small
fish, a lot of mackerel.

00:11:08.004 --> 00:11:10.259
So I guess it really just
depends on what day you come.

00:11:10.259 --> 00:11:11.652
You might see some bigger fish,

00:11:11.652 --> 00:11:14.110
you might see some more interesting fish.

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:16.659
But today was just kind of small fish.

00:11:16.659 --> 00:11:17.992
But that's cool!

00:11:18.882 --> 00:11:20.382
This is real life.

00:11:22.105 --> 00:11:24.921
This is the reality,
this is a local market.

00:11:24.921 --> 00:11:26.750
They are selling fish just for people

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:30.917
within this neighborhood and
in this coastal community.

00:11:32.464 --> 00:11:34.031
This is what I love seeing.

00:11:34.031 --> 00:11:35.364
This is amazing.

00:11:36.258 --> 00:11:38.841
(reggae music)

00:11:41.042 --> 00:11:42.069
So we're gonna just drive around

00:11:42.069 --> 00:11:43.967
and hopefully find somewhere to eat lunch

00:11:43.967 --> 00:11:47.387
and eat that eel and then
just enjoy this area.

00:11:47.387 --> 00:11:49.970
(reggae music)

00:11:55.899 --> 00:11:57.614
We just stopped on the side of the road

00:11:57.614 --> 00:11:59.893
because Ying spotted,
they're picking the coconuts.

00:11:59.893 --> 00:12:01.281
But they're using monkeys.

00:12:01.281 --> 00:12:03.692
Monkeys are up in the
trees and they're the ones,

00:12:03.692 --> 00:12:05.317
the monkeys are picking the coconuts.

00:12:05.317 --> 00:12:07.567
Boom! Here comes a coconut.

00:12:12.077 --> 00:12:15.827
(speaks in foreign language)

00:12:20.021 --> 00:12:22.525
Most of the coconuts in
this coconut field are all

00:12:22.525 --> 00:12:25.120
old coconuts and so they're
picking them for coconut milk.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.477
So you can't really, the water
in them doesn't taste so good

00:12:27.477 --> 00:12:29.944
but I asked them if they
have some young coconuts

00:12:29.944 --> 00:12:31.256
that I can buy.

00:12:31.256 --> 00:12:33.531
According to NPR,
Thailand has been raising

00:12:33.531 --> 00:12:36.743
and training monkeys to pick
coconuts for over 400 years.

00:12:36.743 --> 00:12:38.905
And while there's some notable controversy

00:12:38.905 --> 00:12:40.867
about the practice, in the short time

00:12:40.867 --> 00:12:42.337
that I had the chance to watch,

00:12:42.337 --> 00:12:44.809
I saw the owners handling their monkeys,

00:12:44.809 --> 00:12:47.378
this particular monkey
who's name was Kaimuk,

00:12:47.378 --> 00:12:50.626
with respect and as if they
were part of their family.

00:12:50.626 --> 00:12:53.209
(reggae music)

00:12:56.083 --> 00:12:59.833
(speaks in foreign language)

00:13:06.896 --> 00:13:09.479
(reggae music)

00:13:14.308 --> 00:13:16.378
We've stopped off just
at a local restaurant.

00:13:16.378 --> 00:13:18.730
There's not a lot of choices
for restaurants around here

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:20.344
but this looks like an amazing spot.

00:13:20.344 --> 00:13:22.436
It's right next to the beach.

00:13:22.436 --> 00:13:25.064
We have beach front tables.

00:13:25.064 --> 00:13:27.902
(speaking in foreign language)

00:13:27.902 --> 00:13:29.904
They have a few seats under shelter

00:13:29.904 --> 00:13:32.657
in front of the restaurant
but this, this out here

00:13:32.657 --> 00:13:35.244
on the beach is the real
beauty of the restaurant.

00:13:35.244 --> 00:13:38.213
(reggae music)

00:13:38.213 --> 00:13:40.365
The setting here could
not be more spectacular.

00:13:40.365 --> 00:13:43.474
The biggest danger right now,

00:13:43.474 --> 00:13:47.903
is that I'm like this far
away from a coconut tree.

00:13:47.903 --> 00:13:49.264
So I better eat fast.

00:13:49.264 --> 00:13:50.706
I'm gonna start with the kraprao neua

00:13:50.706 --> 00:13:52.761
and this is beef
stir-fried with holy basil.

00:13:52.761 --> 00:13:55.476
There's chilies in here,
there's onions she put

00:13:55.476 --> 00:13:58.309
and also sliced up long beans.

00:13:58.309 --> 00:14:01.226
And put this onto my rice, oh yeah!

00:14:04.273 --> 00:14:06.781
The holy basil is really strong.

00:14:06.781 --> 00:14:08.317
It's a little bit spicy.

00:14:08.317 --> 00:14:10.391
You can taste the oyster sauce in there.

00:14:10.391 --> 00:14:11.440
It's a little bit of a balance

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:15.242
between salty and a
little bit sweet as well.

00:14:15.242 --> 00:14:17.552
Next up, these are the
tiny little shellfish

00:14:17.552 --> 00:14:19.453
that, maybe they're tiny little clams,

00:14:19.453 --> 00:14:21.217
I think they're tiny little
clams that she stir-fried up.

00:14:21.217 --> 00:14:23.053
This was not really on
their menu that they cooked

00:14:23.053 --> 00:14:24.344
but I saw them in the back there

00:14:24.344 --> 00:14:26.834
and I asked them if they would cook them.

00:14:26.834 --> 00:14:29.705
And then she just, like
graciously, cooked a plate for us.

00:14:29.705 --> 00:14:31.852
And look at these little
guys, they're tiny.

00:14:31.852 --> 00:14:34.261
And you just, I saw these
at the market as well.

00:14:34.261 --> 00:14:35.440
So they did sell them at the market,

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:39.023
at the seafood market
earlier this morning.

00:14:41.188 --> 00:14:42.421
Oh yeah!

00:14:42.421 --> 00:14:43.839
Those are tiny but those are really good.

00:14:43.839 --> 00:14:47.771
That's just a tiny, tiny little
bit of flavor in every shell

00:14:47.771 --> 00:14:50.338
but the flavor that you
do get is wonderful.

00:14:50.338 --> 00:14:52.671
These are like snack shells.

00:14:53.916 --> 00:14:56.117
They're just sit here and
snack on them all day long.

00:14:56.117 --> 00:14:58.936
Okay next up our Kai
jeow, this is an omelet.

00:14:58.936 --> 00:15:02.001
Oh she put some onions
in here too, wonderful.

00:15:02.001 --> 00:15:04.117
And I will add a little
bit of that Prik Nam Pla,

00:15:04.117 --> 00:15:06.784
which is fish sauce and chilies.

00:15:12.914 --> 00:15:14.966
It's one of the great flavors of Thailand.

00:15:14.966 --> 00:15:17.018
It's crispy, it's salty.

00:15:17.018 --> 00:15:21.185
The fish sauce gives it the
wonderful Thai uniqueness of it.

00:15:22.231 --> 00:15:24.128
And then finally not forgetting the eel.

00:15:24.128 --> 00:15:27.878
(speaks in foreign language)

00:15:31.753 --> 00:15:33.073
Let me take out some of this.

00:15:33.073 --> 00:15:34.011
There's some bones in here too

00:15:34.011 --> 00:15:36.295
but you can see all of that, oh wow!

00:15:36.295 --> 00:15:40.743
Look at how chunky and just
full of all those ingredients,

00:15:40.743 --> 00:15:42.637
those herbs, there's lemongrass in there,

00:15:42.637 --> 00:15:46.026
there's turmeric, there's
young pepper in there.

00:15:46.026 --> 00:15:47.084
(woman speaks in foreign language)

00:15:47.084 --> 00:15:49.079
(Ying laughs)

00:15:49.079 --> 00:15:52.301
(Mark speaks in foreign language)

00:15:52.301 --> 00:15:54.568
Alright, so with the eel, you gotta,

00:15:54.568 --> 00:15:58.735
I'm not sure if there's any
bones in this bite or not.

00:16:02.991 --> 00:16:03.824
Wow!

00:16:04.678 --> 00:16:06.878
That eel is absolutely spectacular.

00:16:06.878 --> 00:16:09.586
The eel itself just sorta
melts in your mouth.

00:16:09.586 --> 00:16:11.833
It's so soft and buttery and fatty.

00:16:11.833 --> 00:16:13.705
But then that curry paste
that it's fried with

00:16:13.705 --> 00:16:16.305
they just, massive flavor it's,

00:16:16.305 --> 00:16:18.348
you can taste the lemongrass,
the turmeric in there.

00:16:18.348 --> 00:16:19.301
It's spicy.

00:16:19.301 --> 00:16:20.583
Properly spicy.

00:16:20.583 --> 00:16:21.958
I love the green peppercorns and also

00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:25.078
you can taste the holy
basil in there as well.

00:16:25.078 --> 00:16:28.995
(speaking in foreign language)

00:16:30.367 --> 00:16:34.024
This is the type of community,
rural, countryside restaurant

00:16:34.024 --> 00:16:36.881
that's so friendly, that the owner,

00:16:36.881 --> 00:16:38.820
who is the auntie who's cooking comes over

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:41.197
just to not only say hi but to come over

00:16:41.197 --> 00:16:44.267
and sit and chat and just hang
out while were eating here

00:16:44.267 --> 00:16:46.850
and then that's the first
time we've ever met her.

00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:49.056
Oh, the love, the community,

00:16:49.056 --> 00:16:52.379
the friendliness of this
place is unbelievable.

00:16:52.379 --> 00:16:54.417
These little shellfish
are addictively good.

00:16:54.417 --> 00:16:56.375
They're so good,

00:16:56.375 --> 00:16:58.125
but they're so small.

00:17:00.238 --> 00:17:03.161
You just kinda slurp them down.

00:17:03.161 --> 00:17:04.074
They're delicious.

00:17:04.074 --> 00:17:06.632
That was an extremely satisfying lunch.

00:17:06.632 --> 00:17:09.781
But there is one thing on my mind.

00:17:09.781 --> 00:17:12.257
The only thing on my
mind after that lunch.

00:17:12.257 --> 00:17:13.779
And it's in the back of the car.

00:17:13.779 --> 00:17:16.362
(reggae music)

00:17:21.866 --> 00:17:23.977
I've never opened a coconut
in this fashion before

00:17:23.977 --> 00:17:26.793
but they have an up-pointed spear.

00:17:26.793 --> 00:17:28.887
This is to, so you
don't fall on it I think

00:17:28.887 --> 00:17:31.693
this piece of coconut but then you,

00:17:31.693 --> 00:17:32.729
I don't know if I'll be able.

00:17:32.729 --> 00:17:34.584
I'm gonna try using
this for the first time.

00:17:34.584 --> 00:17:38.417
Actually I have an expert
who's gonna help me.

00:17:44.471 --> 00:17:48.221
(speaks in foreign language)

00:17:53.797 --> 00:17:55.704
He cut open that coconut a lot better

00:17:55.704 --> 00:17:57.621
than I ever could have.

00:17:58.849 --> 00:18:02.599
(speaks in foreign language)

00:18:07.798 --> 00:18:09.909
That coconut is just filled with water.

00:18:09.909 --> 00:18:12.298
There's so much in there.

00:18:12.298 --> 00:18:13.166
Oh wonderful.

00:18:13.166 --> 00:18:15.206
Oh it's kind of leaking out.

00:18:15.206 --> 00:18:16.228
Got a hole in the shell.

00:18:16.228 --> 00:18:19.978
(speaks in foreign language)

00:18:26.434 --> 00:18:27.267
Oh yeah.

00:18:33.445 --> 00:18:36.719
The coconut is starting to
get on the old side I think.

00:18:36.719 --> 00:18:38.177
It's a little bit, has a little bit

00:18:38.177 --> 00:18:41.402
of a fermented taste but it's really good.

00:18:41.402 --> 00:18:43.569
It's sweet and refreshing.

00:18:46.198 --> 00:18:48.581
Oh yeah, it almost has like a fizz to it.

00:18:48.581 --> 00:18:51.454
Just gonna take a walk out onto the beach.

00:18:51.454 --> 00:18:54.743
But that was a satisfying lunch.

00:18:54.743 --> 00:18:57.660
And just take a look at this beach.

00:18:59.245 --> 00:19:02.280
Just part of what makes
it, it's just how peaceful,

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:06.945
how relaxing, and how quiet,
and friendly this place is.

00:19:06.945 --> 00:19:10.349
Lunch was good but I also
highly, highly enjoyed

00:19:10.349 --> 00:19:12.880
walking around the market this morning.

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:14.548
Ying and I have met just in a,

00:19:14.548 --> 00:19:16.584
we've only been here in
Sichon for a very short time

00:19:16.584 --> 00:19:18.717
but we have already met so many,

00:19:18.717 --> 00:19:21.450
so many friendly, genuine people.

00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:25.117
This is really an amazing
coastal community.

00:19:25.995 --> 00:19:27.529
I'm gonna end this video right now.

00:19:27.529 --> 00:19:29.463
