permission he told me exactly what it
was we're going to go up into his brain

00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:51.439
was we're going to go up into his brain
 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:54.309
was we're going to go up into his brain
through it leg and there's a ninety-six

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319
through it leg and there's a ninety-six
 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:55.929
through it leg and there's a ninety-six
percent chance that this will work and

00:02:55.929 --> 00:02:55.939
percent chance that this will work and
 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:57.399
percent chance that this will work and
there's a four percent chance that it

00:02:57.399 --> 00:02:57.409
there's a four percent chance that it
 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:59.280
there's a four percent chance that it
won't work and then he may even be worse

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290
