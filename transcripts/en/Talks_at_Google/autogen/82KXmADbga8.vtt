[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.720
SPEAKER 1: I am really, really
excited to bring onstage

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.970
Rochelle Briscoe, who is
an HR people partner here,

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:12.810
at YouTube.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.493
We've got Taraji coming on
stage, who I don't think

00:00:15.493 --> 00:00:16.410
needs an introduction.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.202
We've got Robin Bissell,
who was the writer

00:00:18.202 --> 00:00:21.000
and director of this
very amazing movie,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.050
"The Best of Enemies."

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.240
And then we've also got
Dominique Telson coming on,

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.290
who produced this movie.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:26.123
Please welcome them.

00:00:26.123 --> 00:00:29.350
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.150
DOMINIQUE TELSON: [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:36.113 --> 00:00:37.530
ROCHELLE BRISCOE:
Well, as you can

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.520
tell from that
very warm welcome,

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.690
we're so excited to
have all of you here.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.150
Everyone has just
seen an amazing clip

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.010
from "The Best of Enemies."

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.340
And this was four years
ago, when we first

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.050
heard that you signed on,
Taraji, to be part of the film.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.210
Can you tell us a little
bit about the process.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.650
When you saw this,
what made you decide

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.370
that this was right for you?

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.790
TARAJI P. HENSON: Well,
Danny Strong, co-creator--

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.790
one of the co-creators
and producers of Empire

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.230
gave me this script when we
filmed the pilot for "Empire."

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:18.160
And then the show became a big
success, and it was hard for me

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.000
to schedule my schedule.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.530
I had so many
scheduling conflicts.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.880
And then, it was after
the 2016 election,

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.993
I noticed that the racial
climate change drastically.

00:01:29.993 --> 00:01:31.410
So I called Danny,
and I was like,

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.050
we have to make this movie,
and we got to make it now.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.670
And at the time, I
was already slated

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.330
to do "Proud Mary,"
on my hiatus.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.290
And so he was like, you
already have a movie.

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:42.180
And I was like, I don't care.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.000
Make it happen.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.680
Make the dates work, and I
will give up my entire hiatus.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.240
And that's what I did.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.770
ROCHELLE BRISCOE:
That's fantastic.

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.890
And Robin, you had produced
some amazing blockbusters--

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.960
"Seabiscuit," "The
Hunger Games,"

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.460
"Pleasantville," but this
is your directorial debut.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.490
ROBIN BISSELL: Yeah.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.340
ROCHELLE BRISCOE: For you,
what made this your first?

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.432
How'd you choose?

00:02:03.432 --> 00:02:04.890
ROBIN BISSELL:
Well, it was a story

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.660
I'd first heard about in 2005.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.590
And so I had been really
anxious to do something with it.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.660
At the time, as a
producer, you have

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.490
to find a writer and
a director and do

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.890
all that to have something
come to fruition.

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.320
But after "The
Hunger Games," I had

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.110
been thinking about wanting
to-- because I started out

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.570
as a singer-songwriter,
way back in the '90s,

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.420
and so I fancied
myself creative.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.440
So after "The Hunger
Games," that was my time

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.550
I thought about directing.

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.440
And this is the
one thing I'd just

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.310
been wanting to do, just
tell the story regardless

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.540
of how I was involved.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.410
And so I sat down, and I
called my friend, Danny Strong,

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.160
and said, I'm going
to start writing this.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.300
And I did.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.570
ROCHELLE BRISCOE: Great.

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:46.403
ROBIN BISSELL: Yeah.

00:02:46.403 --> 00:02:46.975
Yeah.

00:02:46.975 --> 00:02:48.975
ROCHELLE BRISCOE: And
what about you, Dominique?

00:02:48.975 --> 00:02:51.090
Had you worked with
Robin or Taraji before?

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.260
How'd you decide to produce?

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.510
DOMINIQUE TELSON: No, I
hadn't worked with either one.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.560
But actually, another
one of Robin's friends,

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.120
Matt Berenson--

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.663
I think they were tennis
partners is what he told me--

00:03:02.663 --> 00:03:04.830
said, you know, my friend
Robin gave me this script.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.600
So he read it, and
then he sent it to me.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:12.780
And when I read it, I was like,
I want to make this movie.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.600
I just fell in love with
the character of Ann Atwater

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.820
and, of course,
like everyone else,

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.480
googled, did she really exist,
is this really a real person,

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.290
and just was
fascinated by what she

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.830
was able to do in her community
with this film, and then

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:38.180
just in her life, as
a woman in this town.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.503
And so I made it
my goal to make it.

00:03:40.503 --> 00:03:41.670
ROCHELLE BRISCOE: Thank you.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:42.503
Thanks for doing it.

00:03:42.503 --> 00:03:46.380
Not just did she exist, but
I understand some of you

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.770
had a chance to meet her
before her passing in 2016?

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.290
ROBIN BISSELL: Yeah, so when I--

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.615
I'm sorry, did I interrupt you?

00:03:53.615 --> 00:03:53.690
ROCHELLE BRISCOE: No.

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.110
ROBIN BISSELL: Did you
have another second half

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.777
to the question?

00:03:55.777 --> 00:03:56.580
[CHUCKLING]

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.610
Yeah, so right after I
re-optioned the book--

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.220
because I had let the
option lapse in 2009.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.870
I re-optioned the book in 2013,
and I beelined it for Durham.

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.180
And I called Ann, and
she was very open.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.105
And she was in the
hospital at the time

00:04:12.105 --> 00:04:14.180
because she hurt her knee.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.320
And so we just started
having lunch and talking.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.450
And I'd go back, and
then I kept going back.

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.760
And then Bill Riddick
also, who's still alive--

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.530
I just started spending
time with them.

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.900
And you know, Ann was just
sharp as a tack, literally,

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.370
up until she passed in 2016.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.325
It's a big regret we didn't
get to get it done before

00:04:33.325 --> 00:04:34.450
because she was so excited.

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.560
First, she was so excited that
Taraji was going to play her--

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.185
I mean, beyond.

00:04:38.185 --> 00:04:39.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.150
And she was just so
excited for the movie--

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.910
yeah, really, a wonderful woman,
really wonderful-- and really

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.350
gave me a lot of perspective
as a filmmaker into not just

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.890
herself but what it was
like in the '50s, '60s,

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.015
and '70s in the south, and
great perspective on CP.

00:04:57.015 --> 00:04:59.700
He wasn't alive anymore.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.830
And seeing it through
her eyes allowed

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.380
me to three-dimensionalize
him more.

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:04.980
So--

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.605
DOMINIQUE TELSON: We
got a few of them.

00:05:06.605 --> 00:05:09.600
I mean, the families came
on set and were there.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.620
Bill Riddick was there
during the charette.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.530
So he helped a lot.

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.070
Because you watch this, and
you go, how did this happen?

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:18.690
He goes, when I met
them, I couldn't

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:19.860
stand either one of them.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:20.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.840
They were both nasty.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.380
And so it was kind of great
to see that, that perspective,

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.380
because, again, it
three-dimensionalized the story

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.340
that Robin had written
in his screenplay.

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:33.960
And then, they
all came to this--

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.230
all his children
and grandchildren

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:38.820
and her children
and grandchildren

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.260
came to the premiere
that we had.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:41.945
We had a screening
in Durham for them.

00:05:41.945 --> 00:05:43.570
And they were really,
really supportive

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.600
of the film, which was great.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.090
ROCHELLE BRISCOE:
That's amazing.

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:49.892
Yeah, it definitely comes alive.

00:05:49.892 --> 00:05:50.850
It's three dimensional.

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.720
You feel every bit of it.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.470
And one of the areas
that really struck me

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:59.790
was just how extreme there
are-- some of the scenes.

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:04.830
And it's this very severe
optimism, matched shortly

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.290
with severe pessimism.

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:11.760
And for you, Taraji,
and you, Robin,

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.850
how do you embody
that in a character

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:17.964
and create that, as a director?

00:06:17.964 --> 00:06:21.690
TARAJI P. HENSON: Uh, I
mean, well, I couldn't really

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:24.070
add too much because
Ann was a really--

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:26.460
a real person.

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.050
I just listened to
a lot of the stuff

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:31.080
people said about
her, that she was

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:35.980
a powerhouse, Roughneck Annie.

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:40.380
CP would always say you could
hear her before you see her.

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:41.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:42.735
She had a big mouth.

00:06:42.735 --> 00:06:48.060
[CHUCKLES] So those are
real specific descriptions

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.110
of a person.

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:51.060
And that sounds
like somebody that

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:52.500
doesn't take no for an answer.

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:57.360
That sounds like somebody
that gets things done.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.700
And the fact that she
went up against so many

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.370
powerful, white men,
and she was unafraid.

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:03.310
She was fearless.

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:05.172
She would die for the cause.

00:07:05.172 --> 00:07:06.630
That's how important
it was for her

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:08.380
to leave this world
in a much better place

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.130
than she found it, for her
children and for a generation

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:13.420
after her.

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:15.180
And she wasn't rich.

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:16.320
She wasn't a rich woman.

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:21.350
She had no money, but she
had compassion in her heart.

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:23.940
And she was a true Christian
because, as Christians, you're

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.570
supposed to love your enemy.

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:27.270
It's hard to do, but she did it.

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:32.110
She just didn't back down.

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:34.210
I mean, good gracious,
I couldn't imagine.

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:39.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:42.100
When I had a
physicalize her, I just

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:45.430
imagined her when she gets--
she moved with a purpose.

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:48.310
You know, this is a woman
who, whenever she's moving,

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:49.540
she's moving with a purpose.

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:52.060
And I just imagine a locomotive.

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:52.970
You know what I mean?

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:55.320
And if you get in her way,
she's going to steamroll you.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.920
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.020
So I just thought
about things like that.

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:03.280
And at the time, it
was so desperate.

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:06.675
It was like poor
people and black people

00:08:06.675 --> 00:08:08.050
in particular, in
that community,

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:10.150
their backs were
against the wall.

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:13.040
What happens when you back
somebody up into a corner?

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.980
They come out swinging.

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:18.030
And I just kept that
on board every time,

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:21.587
that she wasn't just
fighting for herself

00:08:21.587 --> 00:08:23.170
and for her children,
she was fighting

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:26.860
for the next generation.

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:29.650
And that's heavy
weight to carry.

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:32.400
ROBIN BISSELL: Yeah, and she was
just talking about their backs

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.400
are against the wall and
what your question was,

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.350
which was the juxtaposition
of pessimism and optimism.

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:40.299
And we live in such a
pessimistic time now.

00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:43.270
We talk about how we first
heard the story years ago,

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:44.890
and it was relevant then.

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:48.890
And I think that in
these kind of times,

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:51.650
and then the
smallest bit of hope

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:54.650
really can save you,
even in an hour or a day.

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:56.260
People have the
smallest bit of hope.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:56.870
It's like, oh, my god.

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:57.560
It might be OK.

00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:04.850
And they embrace optimism, even
when it's a terrible landscape.

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:07.880
And these people were
the same way, I think.

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:09.490
And we talked about it.

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:11.990
Taraji and I and Dominique were
talking about it last night,

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:14.990
how these weren't just--

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:17.810
they were poor, and they
were in a small town--

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:19.460
Durham's a relatively
small town--

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:21.890
but they were leaders
within that town.

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:27.530
And so it's no accident that
there was a trickle down effect

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:31.040
from some people who
had a change of heart.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:34.280
I mean, generational-- we've
been meeting with CP's family.

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.505
And his kids and grandkids,
there's no hate in them.

00:09:36.505 --> 00:09:37.880
I mean, they're
wonderful people,

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.520
and that stopped because
of Ann stopped him.

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.860
And so you look at these people.

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:44.300
Bill Riddick was a leader.

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:46.880
Ann Atwater was a leader who
had people who would follow her

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.560
to the ends of the earth.

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:53.150
But she had her own ideology
as far as shutting herself off

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:54.170
to certain conversation.

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:56.778
CP-- obviously on
the wrong side,

00:09:56.778 --> 00:09:58.820
but he had a lot of people
that would follow him.

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:02.030
So Bill Riddick was able
to work on Ann Atwater

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:04.640
to have her zoom out a little,
see a little bit of the bigger

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:07.700
picture because she had made
such a difference in people's

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:08.850
lives.

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:10.940
And this would allow
her to tap into CP,

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:12.045
who was another leader.

00:10:12.045 --> 00:10:13.670
And she knew if she
could tap into him,

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:14.970
maybe that would trickle down.

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:15.470
Right?

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:17.090
And it's courage of leadership.

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:19.220
It's courage of moral courage.

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:23.750
And that's what
we're missing today.

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:26.300
I mean, there's
plenty of leaders

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:28.340
we know, plenty of our
people in Washington, who

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:32.090
know there's a gun problem, who
know there's a problem with law

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:34.430
enforcement, who know
there's a racial problem, who

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:36.260
know there's a climate problem.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:37.370
They know.

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:38.920
They're not stupid, right?

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:39.920
But where's the courage?

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:44.422
Where's the courage
to lead the right way?

00:10:44.422 --> 00:10:46.880
ROCHELLE BRISCOE: Yeah, we have
to dig into that ourselves,

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.790
as people.

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:50.540
I'm going to ask a
little more personally,

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:52.743
because I did spend 16
years in the Beltway,

00:10:52.743 --> 00:10:55.160
so I'm going to stay away from
that for this conversation.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:00.360
But in your own
personal experience,

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:03.590
is there something that
you drew from or thought

00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:08.780
about when you're agreeing to be
in, produce, direct this story?

00:11:11.385 --> 00:11:12.760
TARAJI P. HENSON:
I guess for me,

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:18.960
it was just what made
it so important for me

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:22.140
and why I gave up
my entire hiatus--

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:23.346
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:23.346 --> 00:11:25.300
ROBIN BISSELL: She never
lets me forget that.

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:26.675
DOMINIQUE TELSON: Same.

00:11:26.675 --> 00:11:28.800
TARAJI P. HENSON: --it's
because, I mean, you know.

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.510
You see this world.

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:33.750
And as an artist, I
feel like it is our duty

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:35.070
to reflect the times.

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:37.180
That's what we're
supposed to do as artists,

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:42.300
and I take that
responsibility very seriously.

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:44.080
Art has changed my life.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:46.200
I have looked at
a visual painting,

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.060
and it has touched
me to the core

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:50.400
or shifted my
perspective or something.

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.060
Art is that powerful.

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:55.770
So whenever I pick
rolls, some might

00:11:55.770 --> 00:12:00.330
be for fun, but a lot of them,
if you pay close attention,

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:04.470
it's examples of something to
leave for our kids or a message

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:08.130
to change a group of
people's perception

00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:09.970
on another group of people.

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:12.540
The more stories that
we tell, the more

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:15.390
we are aware that different
stories and different people

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:16.260
exist.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.750
And until we don't have to
make stories like this, where

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:20.502
we have to put a
mirror up to society

00:12:20.502 --> 00:12:22.710
and say, hey, [NERVOUS CHUCKLE]
not looking so good--

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:27.590
clean it up-- then we will
continue to make these films.

00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:28.560
They're important.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.570
This is how you push
humanity forward.

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:33.000
So this is why did the film.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
I felt it was like a great
responsibility of mine,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:36.720
as an artist.

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.290
DOMINIQUE TELSON: Mm-hmm.

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:43.410
And I guess, as a producer,
when I read this script,

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:44.880
I have three
daughters, and they're

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.170
coming up in this world.

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:49.060
And it can be tough.

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:52.620
And when I saw this
example of Ann Atwater,

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:54.390
that's the message I
wanted them to know,

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:57.360
to have that hope that
look at this woman.

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:00.720
And she was fierce
and just kept going

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:04.860
and had the courage to do
what, really, no one else--

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:05.990
what no one else did.

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:09.060
And I want them to have the
hope that if you put yourself

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:12.330
into it, maybe there
is hope for change.

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:14.220
She was known as
Roughhouse Annie,

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:17.040
but in order to
reach CP, she had

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:19.050
to step back from
being Roughhouse Annie

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:20.310
and find a new way.

00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:21.910
She had to find a way to his--

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:24.720
Taraji says this all the time--
but to his heart and soul.

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.100
And that's what she did.

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:30.150
And actually, that
takes a lot more courage

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:33.450
than it sometimes is
to just be roughhouse.

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:36.710
So I love this film
because of that.

00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:37.710
I want them to see that.

00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:40.410
And I want the world
to see this film.

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:42.330
And by the way, last
thing as a producer,

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:45.040
I love having diversity in
front of and behind the camera.

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:49.390
And we did that in Atlanta,
and we had a great crew.

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:51.060
And it was a real family on set.

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:52.770
And I think part of
the reason is because

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:54.330
of our diversity on set.

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:57.270
Even though we were dealing
with a rough subject matter,

00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:59.815
we could look around
and say, you know what?

00:13:59.815 --> 00:14:03.070
We can do this together.

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:05.880
ROBIN BISSELL: Yeah,
for me, it initially

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:10.950
was how I kept thinking
about how we put labels

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:14.700
on each other, and we define
each other in little catch

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:17.250
phrases without even
knowing each other.

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:18.120
I do it too.

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:21.450
I watch TV, or I get angry
just like everyone else.

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:25.110
And you put up these barriers
right away when you get angry.

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:27.660
And I learned to be a
better listener, I think,

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:30.260
through this process.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.760
As artists, we don't
always get to make

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:34.980
films that are entertaining
and are relevant,

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:38.370
or and have this kind
of power or message.

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:40.020
Sometimes we do.

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:41.790
It's OK not to, but you know.

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:47.182
And so for people in this
two-dimensional world,

00:14:47.182 --> 00:14:48.890
we're not really
listening to each other.

00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:54.440
And we know that when you
make a movie, you get to put--

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:56.510
people are in a dark
room for two hours,

00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:59.390
just listening and not talking.

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:01.950
You don't get that
opportunity very often, right?

00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:05.540
And so if we can do it right and
have people engage and become

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:09.408
emotionally invested in the
real lives of these characters,

00:15:09.408 --> 00:15:11.450
and then we can say
something that we want to say

00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:14.180
and what they wanted
to say, that's

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:15.980
a huge platform to
be able to have.

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:19.680
And that's why it--

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:21.255
that's why I love
doing this, really.

00:15:21.255 --> 00:15:22.880
ROCHELLE BRISCOE:
Yeah, that's the hope

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:25.430
that I felt, being
fortunate enough

00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:27.080
to get a chance
to watch the movie

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:31.880
and recognize that maybe--

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:36.890
maybe it's possible to have
real, severe differences

00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:40.220
and somehow get past that.

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:41.727
It seems like,
from your answers,

00:15:41.727 --> 00:15:43.310
you all really believe
that it's still

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:46.820
possible for people to
be diametrically opposed

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:49.760
and on very different
sides of the line,

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:51.282
but to make a change today.

00:15:51.282 --> 00:15:52.490
DOMINIQUE TELSON: Absolutely.

00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:56.260
TARAJI P. HENSON: I
mean, God is very clever.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.370
I'm not going to preach
to anybody today but--

00:15:58.370 --> 00:15:58.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:00.252
[INAUDIBLE]

00:16:00.252 --> 00:16:03.930
I mean, if you believe
in a higher power, God,

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:06.830
I like to say, if
there was only supposed

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:08.930
to be one race to
all-mighty God,

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:11.310
there would only be one race.

00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:12.300
God is very clever.

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:13.470
We all are here.

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:14.890
We look different.

00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:17.250
We come from
different backgrounds,

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:19.170
paying attention for a reason.

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:21.000
And it's for us
to figure it out.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.540
That's our job on life,
in life to figure it out,

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:25.980
to work it out.

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:29.460
And unfortunately, we have
this thing called social media,

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:31.740
and it has driven a
big divide between us

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:35.380
because you would think, yeah, I
could have a great conversation

00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:35.880
on Twitter.

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:38.010
But it goes sour,
each and every time.

00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:40.410
I just see a bunch of
people dragging each other.

00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:43.860
No one's really listening
for understanding.

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:45.557
And it's a world of clickbait.

00:16:45.557 --> 00:16:48.140
Real quick, soon as you hear one
thing, everybody jumps on it,

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:49.057
and they're believing.

00:16:49.057 --> 00:16:52.500
And it's like wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:55.170
Just from one phrase,
everybody believes this?

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:59.430
And it feels like it's
chaos, but it's up to us

00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:02.310
to get it together
and figure it out

00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:04.223
because we're here for a reason.

00:17:04.223 --> 00:17:05.265
ROCHELLE BRISCOE: We are.

00:17:05.265 --> 00:17:06.300
[CHUCKLING]

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:07.609
I'll say amen to you.

00:17:07.609 --> 00:17:11.069
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:11.069 --> 00:17:14.329
You know, I am
tasked today with--

00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:15.829
I had a girlfriend
say, you guys are

00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:18.300
going to talk about this
amazing film, civil rights,

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:19.240
and mental health.

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:20.609
How are you going to do this?

00:17:20.609 --> 00:17:21.500
This is Taraji.

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:22.640
This woman does everything.

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:23.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:24.083
DOMINIQUE TELSON:
You have no idea.

00:17:24.083 --> 00:17:25.470
ROBIN BISSELL: She does.

00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:27.470
ROCHELLE BRISCOE: We're
going to make this work.

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:30.720
And I recognize
this period for you.

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:34.200
You've done things in this
space, our civil rights

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:37.380
era for African-Americans
with "Hidden Figures"

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:39.300
and now with "The
Best of Enemies."

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:43.800
And your father grew up
in the civil rights time.

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:46.600
Did he share his background
stories with you?

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:48.225
TARAJI P. HENSON: I
mean, it was rough.

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:53.180
One time he-- my
dad-- woo, I wish

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:55.110
he was alive to tell his story.

00:17:55.110 --> 00:18:01.100
But, Vietnam vet coming
back with mental issues,

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:03.450
so he had a couple
run-ins with the law

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:09.030
that landed him in jail, in and
out of the mental institution.

00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:12.490
Anytime you go to war, you
never come back the same.

00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:14.160
But my father was an open book.

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:16.930
He didn't hide anything from me.

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:21.390
And he was very open and
honest about his mental state.

00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:24.510
He was able to really work
through it and overcome it all.

00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:28.000
But it was a huge adjustment
after coming back from Vietnam.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.780
It took a while.

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:35.070
But again, you can't grow
if you sweep everything

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:36.390
under the carpet.

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:40.650
And that's my pain for the
African-American community.

00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:44.280
We have generational trauma
that we don't deal with.

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:48.600
And we're walking around as if
everything is OK, and it's not.

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.360
We're walking around
of generations

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:54.540
of issues and trauma
swept under the carpet,

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:57.648
and we're standing on top of
it as if everything's fine.

00:18:57.648 --> 00:18:59.190
ROCHELLE BRISCOE:
Yeah, you're right.

00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:01.007
And it's generational.

00:19:01.007 --> 00:19:02.340
It's impacted [? in the past. ?]

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:04.340
TARAJI P. HENSON: Some
things we don't even know

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:07.300
are affecting us because
it's so embedded in us.

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:08.150
We don't even know.

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:09.320
ROCHELLE BRISCOE: Yeah.

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:11.280
And outside of
your artist career,

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:13.600
last year, you opened
up a foundation

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:14.768
in your father's name.

00:19:14.768 --> 00:19:15.810
TARAJI P. HENSON: Mm-hmm.

00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:18.180
ROCHELLE BRISCOE: Can you
tell us about its mission?

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:22.410
TARAJI P. HENSON: The mission
is to work with the recidivism

00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:24.630
in prison systems.

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:29.550
Because the prison system is
not really a place for reform

00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:33.330
or to get your life
together [CHUCKLES]

00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:36.720
and be implemented back out
into society a changed person.

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:37.470
It's really not.

00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:38.850
It's to keep you there.

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:40.948
And it's unfortunate
because a lot of people

00:19:40.948 --> 00:19:42.990
there have mental issues,
and they shouldn't even

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:45.330
be in cages.

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:48.120
And then we have to--

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:50.880
I was a substitute teacher
before I booked "Baby Boy"

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:54.300
and became an actress.

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:57.740
That was my gig
before I made it.

00:19:57.740 --> 00:19:59.880
But I took it very
seriously, and I

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:04.030
chose to work with special
education children.

00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:07.260
And in my mind, I thought
that meant disabled children

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:10.350
in wheelchairs that can't
eat or dress themselves.

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:14.400
And I get sent to
Crenshaw, and I get--

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:17.070
I'm in a classroom
with all black boys who

00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:20.477
are labeled special ed but
nothing's wrong with them.

00:20:20.477 --> 00:20:21.060
They can walk.

00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:22.350
They can talk.

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:24.240
They smart out the mouth.

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:28.370
And I tell them, let's start
our work, and they do this.

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:29.130
I'm special ed.

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:32.290
I can't do that.

00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:34.590
So just because they
have this label,

00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:37.170
they already have a low
expectation of themselves.

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:39.120
And they believe it.

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:41.440
And it broke my heart.

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:44.700
So then that stood.

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:46.390
I carried that with
me for so many years

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:47.390
and all of this success.

00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:51.660
And so when I came to launch
this foundation, I was like,

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:55.830
we need counselors-- not just
counselors but professional

00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:59.100
therapists, psychiatrists,
that can go into these schools

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:01.350
and recognize that these
children are coming

00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:03.810
from traumatic
experiences at home,

00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:06.510
and we're expecting
them to learn.

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:10.380
Another thing that I've
been caring for years,

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:13.647
when I went to this same school,
the children are taking me

00:21:13.647 --> 00:21:15.480
down the hall, and
they're like, Ms. Henson,

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:17.272
look, there was a
shootout here last night.

00:21:17.272 --> 00:21:17.940
Ha ha ha!

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:19.650
And they're showing
me the bullets,

00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:20.880
the bullets in the wall.

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.810
And I'm like-- And
they're walking around

00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:24.820
like this is normal.

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:26.250
So you see what I mean?

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:30.420
We're expecting these
children to come home from god

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:33.330
knows these experiences
they're having at home, trauma.

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:36.570
And they're traumatized, trying
to come to school and learn.

00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:38.730
And then when they
don't focus in class,

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:41.220
we slap a label on them
and say they're special ed,

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:44.380
but we don't try
to understand why.

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:47.130
And when I started talking
to these young boys,

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:52.817
one was found roaming around
by the train tracks, which

00:21:52.817 --> 00:21:54.900
is in the backyard of the
school by the way, which

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:56.130
is another issue.

00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:59.070
Trying to keep them
focused, and they've

00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:01.620
got a train running through
the back yard every day.

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:03.120
It's whole lot of issues.

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:07.590
But anyway, he was roaming
around the train tracks.

00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:09.648
He got picked up for
shoplifting at the 7-Eleven.

00:22:09.648 --> 00:22:11.190
He was trying to
get something to eat

00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:14.250
because his mother was on drugs
and his father was in prison.

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:17.880
How does that make
you special ed?

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:18.940
You can still learn.

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:21.090
You just have trauma at home.

00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:24.480
So we need to implement
psychiatrists,

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:27.690
who are in these schools,
who can recognize the trauma

00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:30.990
and give these children the
proper care that they need,

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:32.910
as opposed to just
labeling them special ed

00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:36.230
and getting them ready
for the prison system.

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:37.980
So we're dealing with
that, and we're also

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:41.055
giving away scholarships to
young African-American children

00:22:41.055 --> 00:22:42.930
because, see, we don't
talk about it at home.

00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:44.100
It's taboo in our community.

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:45.960
So a lot of times,
our kids don't even

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:47.942
know that this is
a field to study,

00:22:47.942 --> 00:22:50.400
that this is something I can
even go into because we're not

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.140
even talking about it at home.

00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:54.150
So we need more
African-American--

00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:58.630
and it's not even about a
color because I see therapists.

00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:00.450
I need it.

00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:01.260
And it's OK.

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:03.420
[CHUCKLES] I'll be the
first one to tell you

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:05.430
it's OK to not be OK.

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:08.040
But it's not even about a color.

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:10.920
It's cultural competency.

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:17.120
So I can understand
another culture's problems

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:18.920
if I take the time to.

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:21.290
But, see, a lot of times
you have these therapies

00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:23.580
who are coming from
other countries,

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:26.310
and they just want the card
to come here and practice.

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:30.680
So again, you have these people
in these positions that really

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:32.670
don't even want to be there.

00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:36.980
So it's a lot to cover, but
at least we're talking now.

00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:38.290
At least we're talking.

00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:38.930
ROCHELLE BRISCOE:
Yeah, thank you

00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:40.040
for helping that conversation.

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:40.730
ROBIN BISSELL: Now,
you're wondering

00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:42.440
why Ann Atwater--
or you're not--

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:44.240
why Ann Atwater wanted
Taraji to play her.

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:44.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:45.505
DOMINIQUE TELSON: Exactly.

00:23:45.505 --> 00:23:47.505
TARAJI P. HENSON: She
called me the Cookie lady.

00:23:47.505 --> 00:23:49.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:51.956
Cookie lady going to play me.

00:23:51.956 --> 00:23:56.780
ROCHELLE BRISCOE: Yeah, this
is a modern civil rights issue.

00:23:56.780 --> 00:24:02.870
In communities, now, the
difference in a time of crisis

00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:04.730
from an appropriate training--

00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:05.780
de-escalation.

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:08.540
We have this now, with officers,
to recognize the difference

00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:10.310
in violence and mental health.

00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:13.520
It's something that we
say civil rights era,

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:16.130
but we're still living
in this right now.

00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:19.400
And mental health
isn't something

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:22.880
that's just stigmatized in the
African-American community.

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:27.350
Across countries,
communities, classes,

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:30.470
there are stigmas associated
with talking about it,

00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:36.320
addressing it, sharing
that it's OK to be OK.

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:39.980
For you all, before
after this film,

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:43.100
have you ever had to
confront these stigmas

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:46.430
around mental health,
around needing to get help,

00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:47.930
encouraging someone to get help?

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:51.375
And how do you all address it?

00:24:51.375 --> 00:24:53.750
ROBIN BISSELL: My sister went
through a terrible divorce.

00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:55.720
And she actually went through
something for a while.

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:56.900
It was the first
time in our family

00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:58.190
that we had to deal with that.

00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:01.520
And my parents are from the old
school, you know, east coast.

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:04.490
I grew up in suburbs,
kind of sheltered.

00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:08.280
And they didn't really
want to talk about it.

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:10.070
And I was like,
what do you mean?

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:10.610
It's OK.

00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:11.150
We can talk about it.

00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:12.650
This wasn't that
long ago, you know?

00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:20.180
And everything's fine, but
there was a stigma for us.

00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:22.077
It was everything is OK.

00:25:22.077 --> 00:25:22.910
Don't talk about it.

00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:26.040
Well, that's no good because
then we're not asking for help.

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:27.600
It's OK to ask for help.

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:31.070
And I think that's where
any kind of stigma hurts.

00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:33.000
It's that you
don't ask for help.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:33.500
Right?

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:34.750
Asking for help is everything.

00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:36.940
We see we've had, what?

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:39.123
A couple of high-profile
suicides lately, just

00:25:39.123 --> 00:25:40.290
in the last couple of weeks.

00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:41.010
It's been horrible.

00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:41.760
And that's trauma.

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.430
And Taraji talking about trauma.

00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:44.930
Our brains are so fragile.

00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:46.393
Our emotions are fragile.

00:25:46.393 --> 00:25:48.060
There's trauma we
don't even know about.

00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:49.400
It's not just coming
home from war.

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:50.970
It's not-- do you
know what I mean?

00:25:50.970 --> 00:25:53.510
And so I can't begin
to understand it,

00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:57.480
but I do know that when
you get rid of stigma,

00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:00.120
people will ask for help.

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:00.913
And as a father--

00:26:00.913 --> 00:26:01.580
I have two boys.

00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:02.538
One's here at Berkeley.

00:26:02.538 --> 00:26:05.510
And I tell them all the
time, it's OK to ask me.

00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:09.050
If anything's the matter,
don't be too strong--

00:26:09.050 --> 00:26:10.512
or don't try to be.

00:26:10.512 --> 00:26:11.512
TARAJI P. HENSON: It's--

00:26:11.512 --> 00:26:12.140
I'm sorry.

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:12.350
I didn't--

00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:13.040
DOMINIQUE TELSON: No, go ahead.

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:14.623
TARAJI P. HENSON:
It just is something

00:26:14.623 --> 00:26:16.435
that gets under my skin.

00:26:16.435 --> 00:26:18.620
And so many people
need this help,

00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:22.880
but it just seems like
it's set up and designed

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:25.090
to make it as
difficult as possible

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:26.090
for you to get the help.

00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:28.110
I'm talking even within
the SAG insurance.

00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:29.985
That's something I'm
getting ready to tackle.

00:26:29.985 --> 00:26:34.130
Like, why is it that I
can't use my insurance

00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:36.727
to pay for my psychiatrist?

00:26:36.727 --> 00:26:37.310
I'm an artist.

00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:38.510
I need it!

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:39.905
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:39.905 --> 00:26:41.265
DOMINIQUE TELSON: Yeah, wow.

00:26:41.265 --> 00:26:41.765
[INAUDIBLE]

00:26:41.765 --> 00:26:42.890
TARAJI P. HENSON: You know?

00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:44.275
What is happening here?

00:26:44.275 --> 00:26:47.616
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:47.616 --> 00:26:49.910
My psychiatrist broke
that down to me.

00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:53.380
She was like, you have this
amazing insurance program.

00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:57.680
Blue Cross Blue
Shield does cover me.

00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:01.760
But for whatever reasons, I'm
outside of network for SAG.

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:03.380
Go figure.

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:04.580
What are we doing here?

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:06.380
ROCHELLE BRISCOE: Mm.

00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:09.230
We are fortunate and blessed
to have you, all of you,

00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:13.530
tackling these issues on the
screen, off of the screen.

00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:15.770
Thank you for being here.

00:27:15.770 --> 00:27:19.460
We could talk about this
for a while, obviously.

00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:22.940
But for our audience,
for all of the audiences

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:25.700
out there, if I
could ask each of you

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:29.180
as a final question,
what do you want people

00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:31.722
to take away from this film?

00:27:31.722 --> 00:27:33.680
DOMINIQUE TELSON: I want
people to see the film

00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:38.720
and be inspired--

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:40.620
be inspired to look
at your neighbor.

00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:43.340
I think we were talking,
before, about Twitter wars

00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:44.930
and whatever.

00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:47.780
But if you really have to look
the other person in the eye

00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:50.990
and really have a
conversation, maybe there's

00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:53.040
something we can do with that.

00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:56.800
And that's what I hope people
are inspired by, by Ann

00:27:56.800 --> 00:28:02.540
and what she was able to do,
and by the transformation

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:07.400
that CP made, and have hope that
maybe we can come out of this,

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:09.440
and the next generation
is left a little

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:12.470
better off than
ours is right now.

00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:15.890
I mean, honestly, I'm looking
out at your audience here,

00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:17.725
and it's wonderful to see.

00:28:17.725 --> 00:28:19.100
When I started
working corporate,

00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:20.510
it did not look like this.

00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:21.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:22.610
ROCHELLE BRISCOE:
No, we're YouTube.

00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:25.790
When you said you feel proud
on the stage to have the back,

00:28:25.790 --> 00:28:28.160
you know, behind the scenes--

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:28.790
this is us.

00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:30.860
This is behind the
scenes, and we're proud.

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:32.240
A lot of people put in a
lot of work [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:33.657
DOMINIQUE TELSON:
Congratulations.

00:28:33.657 --> 00:28:35.100
I've worked corporate jobs.

00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:36.470
This doesn't look like this.

00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:40.970
And it's just so--
so I hope that this

00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:42.137
is possible because of that.

00:28:42.137 --> 00:28:43.887
Just a quick-- she
doesn't even know this,

00:28:43.887 --> 00:28:46.430
but when I came to the country,
I didn't speak English,

00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:49.070
so I got put in special ed.

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:51.620
And then it's like, I just
didn't speak the language.

00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:53.260
And then I had to get test--

00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:55.700
there's nothing wrong with me.

00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:57.530
Just teach me English.

00:28:57.530 --> 00:28:59.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:00.332
It's crazy.

00:29:00.332 --> 00:29:01.790
TARAJI P. HENSON:
They were getting

00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:02.805
you ready for the prison.

00:29:02.805 --> 00:29:03.763
DOMINIQUE TELSON: Yeah.

00:29:03.763 --> 00:29:04.543
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:04.543 --> 00:29:05.956
Exactly.

00:29:05.956 --> 00:29:06.634
Exactly.

00:29:06.634 --> 00:29:07.134
Exactly.

00:29:07.134 --> 00:29:08.510
ROBIN BISSELL: Instead,
she's in the movie business.

00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:09.052
I don't know.

00:29:09.052 --> 00:29:10.460
DOMINIQUE TELSON: Woo.

00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:10.960
Shew.

00:29:13.708 --> 00:29:15.500
ROBIN BISSELL: For me,
it's the same thing.

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:17.480
There's so many things
to talk about this story.

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:17.660
Right?

00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:19.640
We can talk about it
all day, like you said.

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:23.500
But really what worked
here was [INAUDIBLE]..

00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:24.000
Right?

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:28.680
And so, what
Dominique was saying,

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:30.510
when you sit in
front of someone,

00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:32.175
even if you start
arguing, you're

00:29:32.175 --> 00:29:33.300
not going to argue forever.

00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:35.130
You really let down
your defenses when

00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:37.110
you're-- you're not as
aggressive when you--

00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:38.682
you see people in
road rage videos,

00:29:38.682 --> 00:29:40.140
which I've watched
a lot on YouTube

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:41.140
because it's really fun.

00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:42.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:44.140
But I've gone through
these, believe me.

00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:46.740
So you see what people
say to each other

00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:48.000
when they're behind that--

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:48.480
DOMINIQUE TELSON: Wall.

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:49.690
ROBIN BISSELL: --the glass.

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:50.220
You know what I mean?

00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:52.470
But you stand up, and you
walk to someone-- you're not

00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:53.610
going to say those things.

00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:55.740
Some people, I guess.

00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:58.030
And so you sit down, and
you start talking to people,

00:29:58.030 --> 00:29:59.155
and, oh, you have children.

00:29:59.155 --> 00:30:00.245
And, oh, you like this.

00:30:00.245 --> 00:30:01.620
And, oh, you went
to school here.

00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:02.760
And, oh, you grew up here.

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:04.590
You start forgetting
your differences.

00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:06.268
And you might still
have them, but you

00:30:06.268 --> 00:30:07.560
can talk about it respectfully.

00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:08.900
You can find common ground.

00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:10.650
It's not brain surgery.

00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:13.120
It might be brain surgery
to get us all together.

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:17.322
But once you're there,
you let down your veneer,

00:30:17.322 --> 00:30:19.530
and you just start seeing
each other as human beings.

00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:21.982
It's just what happens.

00:30:21.982 --> 00:30:23.690
ROCHELLE BRISCOE:
Well, I was encouraged.

00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:25.320
The movie's coming
out on April 5.

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:26.760
I think we will
all be encouraged.

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:27.320
Thank you.

00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:28.320
Thank you for the movie.

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:30.390
Thank you for your foundation.

00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:32.100
Thank you for this time today.

00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:32.610
DOMINIQUE TELSON: Thank
you for having us.

00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:33.030
ROBIN BISSELL: Thank you.

00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:33.386
TARAJI P. HENSON:
Thank you so much.

00:30:33.386 --> 00:30:35.303
ROBIN BISSELL: Thank
you, guys, for having us.

00:30:35.303 --> 00:30:36.910
