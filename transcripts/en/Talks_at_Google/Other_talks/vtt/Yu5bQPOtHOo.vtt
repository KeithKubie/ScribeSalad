[APPLAUSE]

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.670
FEMALE SPEAKER 1: Joey
Del Marco was raped.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.370
Or so she says.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.400
A couple weeks ago she pre-gamed
with some of the junior guys

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.720
from our school-- Tim
Delaney, Luke Friedman,

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:27.690
and George Wright.

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.010
They finished a bottle
of vodka and crammed

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.290
into the backseat
of a cab and that's

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:33.840
when she said it happened.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.180
She's saying that's
when they raped her.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.970
But the guys are just
saying that she was wasted

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.900
and just hooked up
with all of them.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.590
But the thing is, if
you know Joey at all,

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.800
her story is pretty fucking hard
to believe because Joey is all

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.360
like, yeah, I'm a slut.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.790
And I own my sexuality.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.250
And I'm on the dance team.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.000
And I hook up.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.620
And look where it got her.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.780
It landed her in the
backseat of a cab

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.290
with a group of boys who
think that she wants it

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.220
because she pretty much
acts like she wants it.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.050
You know what I'm saying?

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.830
And the boys, Tim, Luke,
and George, were arrested.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.040
And now they're on
academic probation waiting

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.310
for all of this to play out.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.410
And no one's heard from Joey.

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.350
None of her friends
on the dance team

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.820
and especially not
her best friend Anna.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.320
Anna's actually Tim's sister
and Tim was one of the guys

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.300
there that night.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.010
My friend James' mom told
my mom that she heard

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.380
Joey was talking to lawyers.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.930
What do I think?

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.170
Honestly, I don't
know what to think.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.710
So.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.960
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: So I
remember that the driver was

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.040
black but not African American.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.360
He was, like,
actually from Africa.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.164
I'm sorry-- I-- I'm
sorry, I just-- I

00:01:52.164 --> 00:01:53.580
don't really
remember specifically

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:54.440
what he looked like.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.148
If I saw him again I
might recognize him.

00:01:56.148 --> 00:02:00.730
Is there any way we could
track him down or something?

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.270
I mean, don't they
have to submit a log

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.080
or submit the
starting and ending

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.330
point of the trip or whatever?

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.610
Because I just-- I don't
really remember specifically

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.720
what he looked like.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.540
OK.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.370
Um, he had really, really
dark skin and no facial hair

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.450
and a shaved head and he might
have been in his 40s, maybe.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.980
And I remember he was playing
music really, really loud.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.390
And Tim asked him to
turn it down a little.

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.272
But the guy just
completely ignored him.

00:02:33.272 --> 00:02:34.920
FEMALE SPEAKER 3: What's up?

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.780
OK, well, it's off now.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.089
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: So it was
Tim, Luke, me, and then George.

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:42.380
And sort of in order for us
to all fit in comfortably--

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:43.110
FEMALE SPEAKER 3: What?

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.710
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: I sort of
slung my leg over George's.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.820
FEMALE SPEAKER 3: Nothing?

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:45.810
FEMALE SPEAKER 2:
But it was nothing.

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.440
I mean, my dress was
still completely covered.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.065
FEMALE SPEAKER 3:
Just, you know, like,

00:02:49.065 --> 00:02:50.630
looking Facebook and stuff?

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.690
OK, can you shut the door?

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:54.660
What?

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:55.450
FEMALE SPEAKER 2:
What were we doing?

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.580
FEMALE SPEAKER 3: Why?

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:56.110
What's she doing?

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.620
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: Uh,
just hanging out, and--

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.620
FEMALE SPEAKER 3: I mean,
is she yelling at dad,

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.126
or is she just crying again?

00:03:01.126 --> 00:03:01.660
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: It wasn't--

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:02.380
FEMALE SPEAKER 3: What
do you want her to do?

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.200
This is just, like--

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.035
FEMALE SPEAKER 2:
--bad right away.

00:03:04.035 --> 00:03:05.243
FEMALE SPEAKER 3: --bad, Tim.

00:03:05.243 --> 00:03:08.390
She loves you so it's just bad.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.092
How am I looking at you?

00:03:10.092 --> 00:03:11.250
No I'm not.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.074
No I haven't.

00:03:12.074 --> 00:03:12.990
I haven't at all, Tim.

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.114
It's just, like, the past
three weeks all I've done

00:03:15.114 --> 00:03:17.252
is go to school, pick
up Thea, and come home.

00:03:17.252 --> 00:03:19.710
And you guys are, like, huddled
in the kitchen or somewhere

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.220
and I'm not a part of any of it.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.140
OK, well, then come
in and shut the door.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.630
No, it's just that,
Tim, you're my brother.

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.270
And I'm really
worried about you.

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.400
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: I just--
I don't know exactly how

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.245
I should say everything.

00:03:33.245 --> 00:03:35.411
You know, I think about it
all the time, constantly.

00:03:35.411 --> 00:03:39.050
I just-- saying it
out loud is just--

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.380
FEMALE SPEAKER 3: Did you do it?

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.179
Yes, yes, no, I
know you said, no!

00:03:44.179 --> 00:03:46.720
No, of course I believe you,
but if you didn't doing anything

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.820
then why were you
fucking arrested?

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.880
And, like, now you're
on academic probation?

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.370
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: I should
say all the details, or--

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:52.828
FEMALE SPEAKER 3:
So tell me, then.

00:03:52.828 --> 00:03:53.770
Just tell me.

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.340
Because Mom and Dad know all
the details and the lawyers

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.050
do, but I don't know anything.

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:59.970
And I'm at school all
day, you know, like,

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.886
hearing all of this
stuff, and we haven't even

00:04:01.886 --> 00:04:03.560
talked about it.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.760
OK.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:05.970
OK.

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.360
So tell me then.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.750
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: So we were
sort of dancing in the back,

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.382
and George was keeping
the beat on my leg.

00:04:13.382 --> 00:04:14.590
And I know that sounds weird.

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.829
He was sort of, like,
playing the drums on my leg.

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:18.940
FEMALE SPEAKER 3: You know how
Joey gets when she's drunk.

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.565
FEMALE SPEAKER 2:
And then George and I

00:04:20.565 --> 00:04:22.860
started to sort of
make out for a second,

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.540
but that was only
for, like, a second.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.985
And then he kind of started
to put his hand up my leg.

00:04:26.985 --> 00:04:28.360
FEMALE SPEAKER 3:
I also know how

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.080
you guys get when you're drunk.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.205
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: But, you
know, I slapped it away,

00:04:32.205 --> 00:04:33.220
like in a friendly way.

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.330
Except he did it again.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.030
Except this time his hand
sort of went up my skirt

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.622
and, like, grazed
my crotch a little.

00:04:40.622 --> 00:04:42.240
And I started to
get sort of nervous.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.140
And I clamped down on
his hand with my hands.

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.130
And I looked at him, and
he was looking past at Luke

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.690
with this face on.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.040
And I don't really know how
to describe the face exactly,

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:59.790
but it was sort of like, hey
dude, look what I'm doing.

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:00.800
And I looked at him.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.040
And I said, George,
come on, stop.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.739
Just wait until we
get to Connor's.

00:05:05.739 --> 00:05:07.530
I mean, I'm not sure
I said "stop" exactly,

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.531
but it was very clear
that I wanted him to stop.

00:05:09.531 --> 00:05:11.446
I mean, I was trying to
pull my leg off of his

00:05:11.446 --> 00:05:13.410
and push his hand off
of me, but I mean,

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.970
he was grabbing my skin.

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.100
He was, like, clawing it.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:22.370
I don't know.

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.780
I don't know if I would've done
anything with him at Connor's.

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.249
I was just saying that.

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:33.040
No, I was just saying
that so he would stop

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.206
doing that stuff in the cab.

00:05:34.206 --> 00:05:36.350
It seemed like a pretty
good idea at the time.

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:38.050
FEMALE SPEAKER 3: Nothing.

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.550
Sorry, no.

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.050
Nothing.

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.540
I'm just picturing
her, you know?

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:43.040
OK.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.130
So what happened next?

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:44.710
FEMALE SPEAKER 2:
So the next thing

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.020
I know, Luke is grabbing
my other leg and sort

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.800
of pulling it to the side.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.140
So my legs would be
more, like, open.

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.990
And then George kind of
put his leg over mine

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:58.410
to kind of hold it down,
and then they both just

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:01.440
started pushing their
shoulders into my shoulders

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.280
against the back of the seat--
like, sort of like that.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.040
And I started to
cry at that point.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.030
And I mean, I could barely move.

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:15.340
And they were pinning me down.

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.760
And then George just started
to pull my dress up and just

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.780
pull it up farther.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:24.294
Sorry, how much
detail do you need?

00:06:24.294 --> 00:06:26.460
FEMALE SPEAKER 3: I hate
thinking of her struggling,

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.480
because you know,
George and Luke

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.486
are so much bigger than her.

00:06:30.486 --> 00:06:32.110
You know, I would've
been beside myself

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.690
hysterical if I was being
pinned down by the two of them.

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:37.670
I would have been screaming
like a psycho or something.

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:40.065
I don't get them.

00:06:40.065 --> 00:06:41.440
FEMALE SPEAKER 2:
And then George

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:47.320
just, really aggressively, like,
pulled my underwear to the side

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.230
and jammed his
two fingers in me.

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:56.160
FEMALE SPEAKER 3:
That's disgusting.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.334
So what did you do?

00:06:58.334 --> 00:07:00.500
What did you do when they
started doing that to her?

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:01.600
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: I mean,
I was crying at that point.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.130
I was hysterically crying,
but I couldn't scream.

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:07.460
I could not make a
scream come out of me.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:08.680
It felt like I was choking.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.180
FEMALE SPEAKER 3: And the cab
driver didn't notice anything?

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:11.550
FEMALE SPEAKER 2:
I mean, there's

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:13.133
a good chance he
didn't hear anything.

00:07:13.133 --> 00:07:15.770
You know, I remember the
music was, like, really loud.

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:16.300
I said that.

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:19.620
But I remember I was staring so
hard into the rear view mirror,

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.940
kind of just wondering
if he would catch my eye.

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:23.650
But I was horrified
at the thought.

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:25.040
I mean, I was so embarrassed.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:28.745
And my vagina was
completely exposed.

00:07:28.745 --> 00:07:31.120
And I kept thinking, if this
guy turns around and sees me

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.490
like this, we're going
to get in a car accident.

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:34.920
FEMALE SPEAKER 3: Well, why
didn't you stop the cab?

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.878
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: George
had his fingers in me.

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:42.200
Two.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:42.980
Yeah, I'm sure.

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:46.920
Because I saw them.

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:53.850
Uh, he was sort of
moving them in and out,

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:57.257
I guess, like, in
a stabbing motion.

00:07:57.257 --> 00:07:59.590
And I mean, he was really
putting his whole body into it

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:01.214
and I was sort of
squeezing everything,

00:08:01.214 --> 00:08:03.990
trying to close myself
up, which probably

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:05.210
made it hurt a lot more.

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:10.730
And the whole time Luke
is making fun of George

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:17.020
because I'm not
cumming-- because I'm not

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:20.170
having an orgasm.

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:23.637
And he was like,
dude, do you even

00:08:23.637 --> 00:08:24.970
know what the fuck you're doing?

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:27.200
You make girls cry you're
so bad at that shit.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:31.190
You're giving this poor
girl fucking pussy burn.

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:33.730
And George was like,
fuck you, dude.

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:34.440
It's not me.

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.530
Her pussy's as dry
as a fucking desert.

00:08:39.869 --> 00:08:45.880
Uh-- and then Luke
sort of laughed,

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.325
and then he put his
fingers in his mouth.

00:08:48.325 --> 00:08:50.672
And I started to
freak out because I

00:08:50.672 --> 00:08:51.880
knew what he was going to do.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:53.320
And I started to
really go crazy.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.930
And then that's when
George said, I quote,

00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:58.615
I feel like we're
fucking wrestling

00:08:58.615 --> 00:09:00.627
an alligator or some shit.

00:09:00.627 --> 00:09:02.460
FEMALE SPEAKER 3: Did
he seriously say that?

00:09:04.944 --> 00:09:06.360
FEMALE SPEAKER 2:
I need a second.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:12.650
I-- yeah.

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:15.394
So George said the alligator
thing and Luke laughed.

00:09:15.394 --> 00:09:17.310
And then he just did the
same thing as George,

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:21.150
except he was trying
to, like, show off.

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:24.820
And he was like, come on, Joey.

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:26.180
I know you want to cum.

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:29.760
I know you're wet now.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:38.312
And then he seemed to get sort
of tired or annoyed with me.

00:09:38.312 --> 00:09:42.010
And he was like, wow, I guess
you're all talk, huh, Joey?

00:09:44.665 --> 00:09:45.790
And then they let go of me.

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:47.700
FEMALE SPEAKER 3: I hate them.

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:49.285
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: I hate them
whenever I think about it.

00:09:49.285 --> 00:09:51.660
FEMALE SPEAKER 3: You know,
that is most disgusting thing

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:52.782
I've ever heard.

00:09:52.782 --> 00:09:53.740
And I don't understand.

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:54.960
She said, no, right?

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.250
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: Yeah, I said
no through the whole thing.

00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:57.970
I was like, come on, no.

00:09:57.970 --> 00:09:58.470
Don't.

00:09:58.470 --> 00:09:58.840
Stop.

00:09:58.840 --> 00:09:59.930
I don't want to do this.

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:00.900
FEMALE SPEAKER 3: So
what were you doing?

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:02.290
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: Tim was
just looking out the window.

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:04.415
FEMALE SPEAKER 3: Well,
why didn't you do anything?

00:10:04.415 --> 00:10:05.380
You sat there, Tim.

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:07.020
You didn't text anybody?

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:08.290
You didn't stop the cab.

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:11.119
You didn't even say
anything to them.

00:10:11.119 --> 00:10:12.910
I'm like, what the hell
are you guys doing?

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:14.860
Stop.

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:15.960
But you were a part of it.

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.550
You were there while your two
best friends were doing crazy

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:20.383
shit to a girl you've
known your whole life,

00:10:20.383 --> 00:10:22.109
and she clearly wasn't into it.

00:10:22.109 --> 00:10:23.650
FEMALE SPEAKER 2:
I really don't want

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:25.090
him to get in a lot of
trouble for all this

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:26.756
because he's actually
a really good guy.

00:10:26.756 --> 00:10:28.470
And he works really hard.

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:32.140
And honestly, he probably
just didn't know what to do.

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:34.390
And that's not
totally his fault.

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:37.360
And mainly he's-- he's the
twin brother of one of my best

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:40.481
friends, Anna.

00:10:40.481 --> 00:10:42.230
I haven't really talked
to her since then.

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:43.520
FEMALE SPEAKER 3: I mean,
you looked at your phone

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.770
and you stared out
the fucking window.

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:48.200
Why?

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.020
Maybe you were drunker
than you thought.

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:51.870
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: Sorry, I
actually don't feel very well.

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:52.750
FEMALE SPEAKER 3: Because
you know her, Tim.

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:53.958
She's one of my best friends.

00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.580
She's gone, like,
camping with us.

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:57.830
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: How much
longer is this going to be?

00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:00.126
FEMALE SPEAKER 3: You're
right, I really don't get it.

00:11:00.126 --> 00:11:02.500
Were you afraid they were
going to hurt you or something?

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:03.834
Because you know, like,
I know what they're

00:11:03.834 --> 00:11:04.989
like when they're drunk.

00:11:04.989 --> 00:11:06.530
OK, so do you remember
that time when

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:08.690
we were in Brooklyn and Luke
took that rock from in front

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:10.830
of the church on Clinton
Street and just smashed it

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:12.300
into the window of the car?

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:13.870
You know, he was out of control.

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:15.975
Do you think he was going to
do something like that to you?

00:11:15.975 --> 00:11:16.630
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: No, no.

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:17.235
I'm fine to keep going, I just--

00:11:17.235 --> 00:11:18.200
FEMALE SPEAKER 3: OK.

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:20.800
So then tell me, because
you're my brother

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:23.510
and I know you better
than anybody, right?

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:26.000
And I just keep thinking
about Thea, Tim.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.280
And how we would literally
kill anybody who did

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.360
anything close to that to her.

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:34.480
I mean, just picture her-- you
know, not knowing what to do,

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:38.210
and then feeling so
scared and so trapped.

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:39.530
And that's how Joey felt.

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:41.260
And you didn't do
anything to help her

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.180
so that's why this thing is,
like, a fucking nightmare to me

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:45.130
or something.

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:46.407
Because you're not that guy.

00:11:46.407 --> 00:11:48.490
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: The last
thing I remember seeing

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:50.120
was Columbus Circle Mall.

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:51.110
FEMALE SPEAKER 3: I
know it happened fast.

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:52.840
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: And then we
were at 78th and Lexington.

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:54.090
FEMALE SPEAKER 3: No, I won't.

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:56.380
Please tell me.

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:58.520
FEMALE SPEAKER 2:
I didn't get out.

00:11:58.520 --> 00:11:59.200
I should have.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.690
I just-- I didn't
know what to do.

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:05.040
I-- my underwear was
ripped and I was sore

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:08.030
and I just stared
at the taxi TV.

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:09.430
They were trying to talk to me.

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:10.990
They were sort of teasing me.

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:14.300
And Luke, like, put
his arm around me

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:19.040
and said something like,
come on, Joey, give me a hug.

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:22.890
You're like the
most down girl ever.

00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:26.810
And Tim was just
staring out the window.

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:30.860
FEMALE SPEAKER 3: He
didn't want to be a pussy.

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:33.950
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: The cab pulled
up at Conner's at I threw $10.

00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:35.960
FEMALE SPEAKER 3:
That's totally fucked.

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:39.650
And I believe you, Tim,
and I love you a lot, OK?

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:41.960
But you have to know
that's totally fucked.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:45.042
Guys don't do that
to other guys.

00:12:45.042 --> 00:12:46.000
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.900
I locked myself in the
bathroom when we got up there,

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:49.150
and I puked everywhere.

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:49.870
FEMALE SPEAKER 3:
Because so what

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:50.840
if they called you a pussy?

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.140
Like, what would've happened?

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:54.260
Would you have lost
them as friends?

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.170
Would you have died?

00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:56.670
OK.

00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:57.920
So then don't be a pussy, Tim.

00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.294
FEMALE SPEAKER 2:
Jane helped me.

00:12:59.294 --> 00:13:02.200
She gave me her underwear and
we called my parents and I got

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.745
home around 10:30-ish.

00:13:03.745 --> 00:13:06.000
FEMALE SPEAKER 3: Why
would the lawyer say that?

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.780
FEMALE SPEAKER 2:
I told my parents.

00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:09.160
They were really good about it.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.114
My mom put my underwear
in a Ziploc bag

00:13:11.114 --> 00:13:13.405
because I guess she thought
there was evidence on them.

00:13:13.405 --> 00:13:16.142
And my dad cried, which
really made me cry.

00:13:16.142 --> 00:13:18.100
FEMALE SPEAKER 3: But
that stuff doesn't matter

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:19.867
because you know they did it.

00:13:19.867 --> 00:13:21.700
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: They're
just disappointed.

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:22.280
FEMALE SPEAKER 3: Yes, Tim.

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:24.150
More than anything, I
obviously want what's

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:25.800
going to be best for you.

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.850
I just don't understand
how that's right, though.

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:33.800
Yeah, mom?

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.420
Yeah, he's right here.

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:36.930
OK, yeah.

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:37.820
We're coming.

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:43.901
I hate our family like this.

00:13:43.901 --> 00:13:44.400
Go.

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:45.300
Yeah.

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:46.960
Yeah, I'm coming.

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:49.690
I'm just realizing, I'm
probably never going

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:51.360
to talk to Joey again, right?

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:58.610
FEMALE SPEAKER 2:
10 to 15 minutes.

00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:03.220
Everything happened in only,
like, 10 to 15 minutes.

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:08.240
That's how long it took for
my life to just implode.

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:11.885
And now I'm slutty girl who
shouldn't have been there

00:14:11.885 --> 00:14:13.260
and I shouldn't
have gotten drunk

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:14.910
and I shouldn't
have done everything

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:17.035
that everybody's saying
that I shouldn't have done.

00:14:17.035 --> 00:14:21.520
But how is it about everything
that I shouldn't have done?

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:25.502
And now I'm that girl.

00:14:25.502 --> 00:14:26.460
And I don't want to be.

00:14:36.825 --> 00:14:38.880
FRED: Hi, everyone.

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:42.090
I'm going to read something
that I wrote for this book.

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:44.481
I wrote it last year
about something that

00:14:44.481 --> 00:14:45.730
happened to me in sixth grade.

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:53.780
You watch porn?

00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:55.950
Lenny asks me with one
of his very signature

00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:59.380
smiles-- the kind of smile
that almost makes you feel bad.

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:01.651
I don't really want to
answer Lenny's question.

00:15:01.651 --> 00:15:03.400
Talking about porn
makes me uncomfortable.

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:05.030
I start to feel tense.

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:07.600
Plus, there's a bunch of
other guys in the room.

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:09.620
It's sixth grade, and I
just started hanging out

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:11.044
with this new group of kids.

00:15:11.044 --> 00:15:12.710
We're at Julian's
house, and I'm sitting

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:15.610
on the couch with Julian,
Jake, Stephen, and Aaron.

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:18.740
Lenny is sitting on a chair
staring at me with his smile,

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:20.399
waiting for an answer.

00:15:20.399 --> 00:15:22.690
He probably knows I don't
really want to talk about it,

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:24.830
but that doesn't
matter much to him.

00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:27.720
He wants his answer,
so he repeats himself.

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:30.020
Do you watch porn?

00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:32.219
I started watching porn
mid-year fifth grade.

00:15:32.219 --> 00:15:34.010
I'd just begun middle
school and befriended

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:35.790
a lot of kids in seventh
and eighth grade,

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:37.530
and sometimes when I
hung out with them,

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:39.363
they'd make jokes about
the porn they watch,

00:15:39.363 --> 00:15:41.120
referencing certain sites.

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.930
After a little bit, I decided
to Google some of these sites

00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:45.890
and was pretty shocked.

00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:48.840
Obviously, I wasn't shocked
because the videos contain

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:51.270
breasts, vaginas, and penises.

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:53.160
I expected that.

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.440
I was shocked because
these videos seemed

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:58.210
to take place in their very
own world with their own rules

00:15:58.210 --> 00:15:59.550
and mentality.

00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:01.600
I had entered a world,
where instead of referring

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.370
to the woman by name,
they're referred

00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:06.250
to by this combination of
their hair color, skin color,

00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:08.390
and the added word
slut or whore.

00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:10.890
I'd entered a world where
every girl is recorded saying

00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:13.210
she wants it and craves cum.

00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:15.350
It was a world where after
each girl was fucked,

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:17.090
she would blow a
kiss to the camera

00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:20.790
and the screen would fade to
black, happily ever after.

00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:23.300
This seemingly
simplistic, dehumanization

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:25.820
of sex that would always
end with the girl being

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:29.810
told how dirty she was and
never anybody else involved.

00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:31.074
It was a strange world.

00:16:31.074 --> 00:16:32.990
And even then, I knew I
wasn't really on board

00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:34.110
with most of it.

00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:36.150
But I still continued to watch.

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:38.310
And lots of days, after
coming home from school

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:39.070
I'd watch porn.

00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:41.647
It was like marathoning
this awful TV show

00:16:41.647 --> 00:16:43.230
where you feel a
strange addictiveness

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:45.914
while watching and then
like crap when you finish.

00:16:45.914 --> 00:16:47.830
I thought it'd be easier
to not actually think

00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:50.460
about what I was watching
when I watched it and decided

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:53.520
I'd separate my normal self
from my porn-watching self

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:54.600
completely.

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:57.860
I was very secretive
about it, telling nobody.

00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:00.440
This was the opposite for
guys like Lenny and Julian.

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:02.801
So many days after school,
I sat and listened to them

00:17:02.801 --> 00:17:04.800
describe the porn they
watched or even sometimes

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:06.185
what other guys watched.

00:17:06.185 --> 00:17:09.650
I remember Julian saying to
me, yo, Lenny likes big girls,

00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:13.130
he was watching video of
these fat hos, and then laugh.

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:15.137
And so Lenny repeats
his question.

00:17:15.137 --> 00:17:17.470
He's still looking at me, and
he's getting kind of angry

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:19.660
that I haven't answered him yet.

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:23.150
I kind of mumble, yeah,
I've watched it a few times.

00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:26.520
He laughs the kind of laugh
that you know is at you.

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:29.450
It's the answer he wanted.

00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:32.510
Around four months later,
I'm in the schoolyard talking

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:35.240
to Julian, and Julian
says how he really

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:36.850
doesn't like Lenny anymore.

00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:39.600
He lists a couple of incidents
where Lenny came to his house

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:41.400
and wrecked his things.

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:45.480
Also, the thing with
Jessica, Julian says.

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:47.380
What thing, I ask him.

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:50.314
He said, two months
ago, he, Stephen,

00:17:50.314 --> 00:17:51.730
and Lenny went to
Jessica's house,

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:53.140
a girl who goes to our school.

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:55.140
Lenny started getting
wild, and he put his penis

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:56.355
on Jessica's leg.

00:17:56.355 --> 00:17:57.730
She was sitting
in her own house,

00:17:57.730 --> 00:17:59.271
just hanging out
with a bunch of kids

00:17:59.271 --> 00:18:01.460
who she thought were
her good friends.

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:03.850
And Lenny took his penis
and he slapped it on her

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:06.620
because he felt like it,
while Stephen and Julian stood

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:08.260
and watched.

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.810
As shocking as everything
was, the reactions

00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:12.475
were maybe the most shocking.

00:18:12.475 --> 00:18:14.970
I overheard kids saying
how Jessica had made it up.

00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:16.370
And some girls in
our school said

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:18.720
she must wanted it to happen.

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:21.020
A group of eighth
graders were high-fiving

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:22.970
Lenny in the hallway,
laughing and smiling.

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:28.160
I still remember one of them
nodding at Lenny, saying, nice.

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:32.780
What's scary is, as much as one
can wish to separate themselves

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:35.440
from what they watch or attempt
to not analyze or question

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:37.270
anything that happens
in those videos,

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:40.610
it's impossible because it
overlaps into our culture.

00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:43.300
The world of porn bleeds
its way into reality.

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:45.210
The "she wanted it"
mentality of porn

00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:47.870
makes its way into the
opinions of 13-year-olds,

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:52.019
even when it's so obvious that
she definitely did not want it.

00:18:52.019 --> 00:18:53.560
And objectification
of women does not

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:55.640
stay within the
confines of a video.

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:58.640
It does not fade away
like a video's final shot.

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:00.380
Permanent harm is done.

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:03.690
Because the most accessible way
that guys of all ages view sex

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:05.810
should not encourage
a male-female dynamic

00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:08.700
that's degrading and unreal.

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:10.820
But that's the main
thing that's out there

00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:12.490
at the click of your mouse.

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:14.260
And it's scary and
it's unfortunate

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:17.046
and it's unfair for
everybody involved.

00:19:17.046 --> 00:19:19.420
And it's even more frightening
how these cycles continue,

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:22.580
how guys like Lenny keep on
coming, because guys like Lenny

00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:24.170
keep on understanding
sex as something

00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:26.365
that they can win or
take because that's how

00:19:26.365 --> 00:19:28.190
it's being presented to them.

00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:30.550
Lenny learns to not be
empathetic around sex.

00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:32.230
It can be something
he's entitled to

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:35.590
and something where the sole
purpose is to please himself

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:37.340
in whatever way he wants.

00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:40.570
And so many of us are so
uncomfortable with sex or rape

00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:42.940
that we blind ourselves
to what's going on,

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:45.380
and we let it continue.

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:48.819
It's been over two years
since everything happened.

00:19:48.819 --> 00:19:50.360
I'm in eighth grade
now, and I didn't

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:54.290
realize how everything connected
until I first saw "Slut."

00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:57.200
I didn't even realize how
much Jessica must have had

00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:59.360
to go through the whole time.

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:01.490
She felt ashamed
for being a victim

00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:03.420
and walked through the
hallways of my school

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:05.850
as if nothing had happened.

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:08.090
I also don't hang out with
Julian and all those guys

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:09.460
anymore.

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:13.240
Recently, in school, though,
we had Family Living class,

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:15.500
and I had to sit
right next to Lenny.

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:18.650
As a class, we started
addressing scary incidents,

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:20.210
and one girl shared
about a time when

00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:22.830
she was harassed by a
stranger on the street who

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:25.570
told her she had a cute butt.

00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:28.220
Lenny couldn't stop giggling.

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:31.990
I turned to look at him, and
I saw on Lenny's face one

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:35.310
of his very signature smiles.

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:36.858
Thank you.

00:20:36.858 --> 00:20:40.246
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:46.772 --> 00:20:47.730
ODLEY: Hello, everyone.

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:49.000
My name is Odley.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.490
I'm just going to read a
testimony I wrote over a year

00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:56.700
ago about how I've witnessed
the media portraying women.

00:21:01.266 --> 00:21:02.640
"When I was a
little kid starting

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:05.530
at about seven years old,
I loved to listen to music

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:07.650
and watch music videos.

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:10.680
I loved hip-hop, R&amp;B,
a little bit of rap,

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:13.510
pop, rock--
basically everything.

00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:16.594
As long as it was
catchy, I loved it.

00:21:16.594 --> 00:21:18.010
I would sing along
to these songs,

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:21.247
having no clue what the artists
were singing and rapping about.

00:21:21.247 --> 00:21:22.830
I would watch the
music videos and see

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:25.140
nothing but African
American women

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:28.530
in bikinis having a good
time and getting attention

00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:30.080
from lots of guys.

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:32.700
One of the songs I
really enjoyed was,

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:37.362
"Big Pimpin'" by Jay Z. Damn,
that cruise ship looked fun.

00:21:37.362 --> 00:21:39.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:42.670
Al the beautiful women,
their amazing swim suits,

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:46.880
smiling, dancing around
the men while champagne

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:48.820
was being poured on
their faces-- I mean,

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:51.880
it seemed like a great
time to me at the time.

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:54.520
I was a young girl, just
dancing to the beat,

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:56.600
drooling over the
glamorous lifestyle

00:21:56.600 --> 00:22:02.160
and laughing, completely unaware
of what was really being said.

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:05.120
As I got older I started
to listen to the lyrics,

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:07.810
and I begun to understand
what was being said.

00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:12.030
Just recently, I was watching
"Throwback Jams" on MTV,

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:14.180
and I heard a familiar beat.

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:18.020
I looked up at the TV, and it
was "Big Pimpin'," big and bold

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:19.220
on my TV.

00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:21.807
I got up, started dancing
and rapping with H.O.V.A.

00:22:21.807 --> 00:22:25.920
'You know I fuck 'em,
love 'em, leave 'em.

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:28.790
I love this song so much.

00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:31.474
Yeah, I got up and starting
rapping with H.O.V.A.,

00:22:31.474 --> 00:22:33.640
you know I, thug 'em, fuck
'em, love 'em, leave 'em,

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:35.420
'cause I don't fucking need 'em.

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:37.295
Take 'em out the hood,
keep 'em looking good,

00:22:37.295 --> 00:22:38.700
but I don't fucking feed 'em.

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:41.160
First time they fuss I'm
breezing, talkin' about, what's

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:41.724
the reason.

00:22:41.724 --> 00:22:44.140
I pimp in the every sense of
the word, bitch, better trust

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:45.380
and believe 'em.

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:50.510
I was suddenly like, OK, whoa.

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:54.170
That's kind of messed up,
but kept jamming to the song.

00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:56.320
Then I heard, hard
cold-ass assassin.

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:57.380
I got no passion.

00:22:57.380 --> 00:22:59.010
I got no patience,
and I hate waiting.

00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:02.740
Ho get your ass in the car
and less ride-i-i-i-i-i-ide.

00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:05.630
You know, everybody
know that part.

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:07.930
I stopped and thought, ho?

00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:09.539
I looked up at the
TV to make sure

00:23:09.539 --> 00:23:11.830
these women in the video
reacted to what was just said,

00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:14.500
but no, they just kept dancing.

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:18.910
I sat back down and wondered,
did anyone hear this but me?

00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:20.652
And the song continued to play.

00:23:20.652 --> 00:23:22.110
It wasn't until
the end of the song

00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:24.490
that I realized this
whole entire thing was

00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:26.650
about spending money,
playing women, and abusing

00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:29.220
women and treating them
less as human beings.

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:31.460
Pimping women, basically.

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:37.300
The lucky women in these videos
are just things, toys, scenery,

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:38.440
not people.

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:40.810
They're self-worth is
completely diminished.

00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:43.580
Yeah, it's OK to be
sexy, but in these videos

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:45.280
the women have no control.

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:47.280
Girls are taught to want
to be like these women,

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:48.740
because, come on,
who wouldn't want

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:53.560
to be partying with Jay-Z
on his bad-ass yacht, right?

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:56.390
And what guy doesn't want to
be Jigga with a rap career

00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:58.530
and cash and bottles
of Cristal and a boat

00:23:58.530 --> 00:24:01.860
full of half-naked sluts, right?

00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:05.080
There is a very unhealthy
male to female dynamic being

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:08.350
modeled in these videos
by celebrities we worship.

00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:10.270
In the media, African
American women

00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:12.760
are often portrayed as
voluptuous and sexual

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:16.070
with ratchet ghetto attitudes
and three baby daddies.

00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:17.900
And music videos pack
the biggest punch

00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:19.770
against these women of color.

00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:22.490
Instead of rapping about
our beauty and our strength,

00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:24.320
male recording
artists are calling us

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:28.110
sexy bitches and fine-ass hos.

00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:30.320
Instead of showing
us affection, they're

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:34.020
pouring alcoholic beverages on
our faces, throwing cash at us,

00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:37.010
telling us to play with
a dick in the truck.

00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:39.350
As an African
American woman, I have

00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:41.029
to stand up and
fight against this.

00:24:41.029 --> 00:24:42.570
I should not have
to feel like I have

00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:44.090
to mimic the women
of these videos

00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:46.290
to get attention
from boys I like.

00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:50.370
And boys should not expect us
to be and act the same way.

00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:52.330
Maybe if the media
didn't portray us

00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:56.310
as hos, bitch, big
booty Judys, or sluts,

00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:58.030
we would get a
little more respect

00:24:58.030 --> 00:25:00.800
and have a little more
room to just be who we are.

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:02.232
Thank you.

00:25:02.232 --> 00:25:08.430
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:10.830
EMILY MORTIMER: I
am Emily Mortimer,

00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:15.500
and I'm an actor and a
writer and am various things.

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:17.910
But I'm also a mother.

00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:20.840
And as a parent of a
five-year-old daughter--

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:25.060
and perhaps more importantly,
an 11-year-old son-- I

00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:29.340
was just incredibly
drawn to Katie

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:32.680
and Meg's amazing project.

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:38.970
These two are the forces behind
this whole thing and the two

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:42.890
ladies who have teased
this incredible stuff out

00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:47.380
of their students and got
this project off the ground.

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:52.630
And it's become this thing, this
little engine that could now.

00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:54.800
And they've taken it
all over the country

00:25:54.800 --> 00:26:01.630
and have used it as a tool
for education everywhere.

00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:04.870
Anyway-- but I wanted to find
out more when I heard about it.

00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:08.980
And I wanted to be more educated
about teenage gender politics

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:11.590
and sexuality and
what really goes on

00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:16.400
between young men
and young women.

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:20.220
But as I talked to Katie
and read more of this book,

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:23.830
I realized that it's
not just my children who

00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:27.030
can benefit from an open
discussion about these things.

00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:28.460
I can too.

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:30.980
And I'm 43.

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:34.470
And you know, I
do feel-- and I've

00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:37.137
felt it more and more as
I've heard these stories

00:26:37.137 --> 00:26:38.970
and read the book and
talked to these guys--

00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:43.910
that as an educated,
liberated woman in 2015

00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:46.980
with a career and an
independent income,

00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:52.110
it turns out that I'm still just
as confused about these issues

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:59.120
as I was when I was 14 and 15,
and that I'm still struggling

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:07.380
with how to square
the need to be

00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:13.890
a strong and driven woman with
a desire and need to be desired

00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:15.690
and to desire.

00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:19.200
And how to keep a
sense of who I am

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:23.820
and what it is that I really
want through all of this.

00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:27.790
Sex is confusing for everyone,
not just for teenagers.

00:27:27.790 --> 00:27:29.980
And I think the more
we're all encouraged

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:32.610
to talk about what confuses
us, the better we'll

00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:34.910
understand each
other and the better

00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:37.030
we'll understand ourselves.

00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:40.160
In the afterword to the
book, Carol Gilligan

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:42.400
talks about wanting
the discussion

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:46.760
about sex and morality to
be about what women really

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:51.530
think as opposed to what
we think we should think.

00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:54.430
And I love that Katie and
Meg and all these brilliant,

00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:58.270
brave, honest, talented
young people who

00:27:58.270 --> 00:28:01.710
have put on this play
and shared their stories

00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:05.150
and helped to write this
book have encouraged us

00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:10.280
and continue to encourage us to
understand what we really think

00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:12.060
and to say it.

00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:14.280
So thank you so much, guys.

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:20.590
And I think they are going to
answer some questions that I'm

00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:22.800
going to start off by asking.

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:25.450
And then if you
guys have anything

00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:28.100
that you'd like
to ask them, then

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:31.590
start brainstorming now
as to what they might be.

00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:35.790
But first of all, Katie and
Meg-- so "Slut" started off

00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:37.830
as a play and then evolved
into this whole sort

00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:40.130
of student activist movement.

00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:41.570
And now it's this book.

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:45.400
Can you tell us a little
bit about the journey

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:48.120
and the story of "Slut"?

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:49.270
KATIE CAPPIELLO: Yeah.

00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:52.260
So Meg and I founded
an arts and activism

00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:55.140
project called the Arts
Effect eight years ago.

00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:59.850
And the goal of that project is
to bring young people together

00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:02.380
to create plays based
on the challenges

00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:05.170
that they face in their lives.

00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:08.240
A dynamic component of our
project is an all-girl theatre

00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:09.390
company.

00:29:09.390 --> 00:29:12.940
The girls are 11
to 20 years old,

00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:17.150
and "Slut" came
out of their lives.

00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:20.260
We were sitting around
talking, like we always do.

00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:24.310
And the word slut, the
idea of slut shaming,

00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:27.070
sexuality, sexual
aggression, rape,

00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:30.080
was popping up in every single
conversation we had with them.

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:32.790
And we'd meet with them
once a week for three hours.

00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:34.480
And it was all we
could talk about.

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:37.350
So we knew it was something
that we needed to dive into.

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:42.910
So we spent a year and a half
improving, creative writing,

00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:45.677
reflective writing, having
more and more discussion.

00:29:45.677 --> 00:29:47.260
Sometimes we'd just
sit there and talk

00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:49.400
for three hours about
every possible way

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:51.300
we could tackle this issue.

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:53.254
And then we had a script.

00:29:53.254 --> 00:29:54.170
MEGAN MCINERNEY: Yeah.

00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:56.211
And the first time we
actually performed the play

00:29:56.211 --> 00:29:58.100
was part of an international
theater festival

00:29:58.100 --> 00:29:59.300
here in New York City.

00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:03.077
And after the performances,
we were so struck by the fact

00:30:03.077 --> 00:30:05.160
that the audiences would
just stand in the street.

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:06.280
It was hundreds
of people standing

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:07.390
in the street of New York City.

00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:08.670
And they wouldn't want
to leave, because they

00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:09.980
wanted to keep talking.

00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:12.460
And so we realized that
there was quite a need

00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:14.730
to have this conversation
and that people wanted it.

00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:19.341
So we created, then, the Stop
Slut coalition, the Stop Slut

00:30:19.341 --> 00:30:20.840
movement, to help
fulfill this need.

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:24.815
And we now have hundreds of
chapters, thousands of members

00:30:24.815 --> 00:30:25.940
all throughout the country.

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:28.020
We have 20 chapters here
alone in New York City

00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:30.810
that are comprised of
students, young people.

00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:33.830
Our youngest is 11
to 20 years old.

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:35.090
And they're the experts.

00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:37.450
So they're the ones that
understand the nuances of how

00:30:37.450 --> 00:30:39.030
this culture is affecting them.

00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:41.890
And they are creating their
own individual plans of action

00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:43.830
for how they can combat
slut shaming and rape

00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:45.044
culture in their communities.

00:30:45.044 --> 00:30:45.960
KATIE CAPPIELLO: Yeah.

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:48.897
So when the Feminist Press
came to us about a year ago

00:30:48.897 --> 00:30:50.730
and said, would you be
interested in putting

00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:52.188
a book together,
and the book would

00:30:52.188 --> 00:30:54.600
contain the script and
essays by young people,

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:58.350
also essays by leading
activists and writers,

00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:01.530
and then an activism guide,
we jumped on the chance.

00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:05.780
Because our goal has
always been to provide

00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:07.950
young people-- and
also their educators,

00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:10.430
their parents, those in
their lives-- with tools

00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:18.620
to safely unpack issues and
effectively take action.

00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:20.550
And for us, theater
and storytelling

00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:22.720
has always been the way in.

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:24.170
So that's where we are.

00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:25.670
MEGAN MCINERNEY:
That's what we did.

00:31:27.125 --> 00:31:28.500
EMILY MORTIMER:
Winnifred, you've

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:30.880
been part of this project
since the very beginning.

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:33.810
And I wondered if
you could help us

00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:43.280
to understand what slut shaming
is and how it can lead to rape.

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:44.920
WINNIFRED BONJEAN-ALPART: Yeah.

00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:49.550
Slut shaming is a way to
target female sexuality,

00:31:49.550 --> 00:31:54.520
to demean and degrade
a women's self-worth.

00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:58.280
And in terms of the
perpetuation of rape culture,

00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:02.000
I think, because it sort
of hijacks a woman's right

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.470
to own her sexuality
and display it

00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:08.930
in whatever way she wants
or feels comfortable with,

00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:11.960
we then take away her power.

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:15.950
And then we as a culture
have consistently used it

00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:21.340
and used the word slut to
delegitimize the experiences

00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:26.240
of victims and survivors.

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:29.960
So yeah, when you take away
a woman's standing and power

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:32.600
in terms of her
sexuality, she is then

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:37.840
vulnerable to be a victim.

00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:41.280
EMILY MORTIMER: And as
young girls in 2015,

00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:57.240
how do you sort of reconcile
the confusing issues

00:32:57.240 --> 00:33:00.590
of how to be a sort of
sexual, fully realized

00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:04.920
being in the world,
as well as how

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:12.130
to keep hold of your power--
and especially when there's

00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:14.100
so much in our
culture that it is

00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:18.090
telling you to flaunt
yourselves and that there

00:33:18.090 --> 00:33:20.010
is power in that?

00:33:20.010 --> 00:33:21.180
I mean, I find it confusing.

00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:23.200
I find Miley Cyrus
really confusing.

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:25.210
Because on the
one hand, I think,

00:33:25.210 --> 00:33:29.720
that's fantastic that this
girl is feeling free enough

00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:32.430
to be that way
and sort of owning

00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:34.510
her sexuality in that way.

00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:40.030
But on the other hand,
it's confusing, you know?

00:33:40.030 --> 00:33:44.290
And I wonder how you
guys live with that

00:33:44.290 --> 00:33:47.430
as young women in the world
and how you kind of deal

00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:48.850
with that in your own brains.

00:33:48.850 --> 00:33:49.340
WINNIFRED BONJEAN-ALPART: Yeah.

00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:51.720
I think, like you said, it's
really, really challenging

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:52.490
to answer that.

00:33:52.490 --> 00:33:55.940
I think walking the line is
probably one of my greatest

00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:59.120
challenges in the last
couple of years because yeah,

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:01.760
as you said, you
want to be sexual.

00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:02.710
That's natural.

00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:04.805
And you have these
conflicting messages.

00:34:04.805 --> 00:34:06.930
We hear about them all the
time, where on one side,

00:34:06.930 --> 00:34:09.510
everyone's telling you, yeah,
no, everyone wants this.

00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:10.760
We want you to act this way.

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:12.480
We want you to reveal yourself.

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:13.150
Do it.

00:34:13.150 --> 00:34:14.733
And then you're
getting shamed for it.

00:34:14.733 --> 00:34:18.969
So I think I've personally
found it nearly impossible

00:34:18.969 --> 00:34:20.170
to negotiate that.

00:34:20.170 --> 00:34:23.409
But I think part of it is
taking away the stigma instead

00:34:23.409 --> 00:34:27.080
of saying, proudly
reclaiming, yeah, you

00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:29.340
know what, I am a
slut, I have a right

00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:32.090
to own my sexuality
as a woman and I

00:34:32.090 --> 00:34:33.800
should be able to do
that without having

00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:38.810
to claim this word, which
is essentially degrading.

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:43.969
So I feel like being able
to confidently discuss

00:34:43.969 --> 00:34:48.420
these issues has enabled me
with tools to sort of have more

00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:51.440
of an internal understanding.

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:53.370
So I can't really change
what other people are

00:34:53.370 --> 00:34:57.240
doing or saying about me, but
if I have a sense of self,

00:34:57.240 --> 00:35:00.650
and I do-- a lot of it is
because of this group-- then

00:35:00.650 --> 00:35:02.136
I am able to combat it.

00:35:02.136 --> 00:35:03.010
EMILY MORTIMER: Yeah.

00:35:03.010 --> 00:35:05.710
And that's awesome.

00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:10.030
And what I feel like
from hearing you all

00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:12.810
and reading the book
is that, in a way,

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:15.370
what you're owning is
the complexity of it

00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:18.230
and the confusion of
it and that that's

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:21.700
so much of an important
part of the discussion.

00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:24.650
It's not like everything
is going to be made clear.

00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:28.590
It's just that you're
owning that this

00:35:28.590 --> 00:35:30.150
is difficult
territory, and it needs

00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:32.930
to be talked about in as
honestly a way as possible.

00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:34.080
OK, cool.

00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:37.950
Now, Eliza and
Darci, you've both

00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:41.320
traveled with the play
across the country.

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:46.370
And I just wondered how people
have responded, how audiences

00:35:46.370 --> 00:35:49.630
have responded in the different
places that you've been to,

00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:50.910
to the play.

00:35:50.910 --> 00:35:52.970
ELIZA PRICE: Yeah, so I
remember the first time

00:35:52.970 --> 00:35:55.680
we put this on, in August 2013.

00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:57.210
I had a friend come to see it.

00:35:57.210 --> 00:35:59.724
And she called
other girls sluts.

00:35:59.724 --> 00:36:01.640
And you know, when guys
would call her sloppy,

00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:03.780
she would just giggle
and laugh it off.

00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:07.216
And I remember she
saw this play and it

00:36:07.216 --> 00:36:08.840
changed her whole
outlook on everything

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:11.720
because now she's one of the
biggest feminists I know.

00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:15.430
And it changes her
outlook, and it

00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:17.800
makes her think twice
about what guys say to her

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:20.880
and how she should respond.

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:26.020
And my mom's friends also
remember their childhood

00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:28.560
and teenage-hood.

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:30.450
I have a 14-year-old brother.

00:36:30.450 --> 00:36:32.880
And I think watching his
reaction was the most powerful

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:36.590
to me because he
called girls sluts

00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:39.250
and he talked about
the word pimp a lot.

00:36:39.250 --> 00:36:42.030
And then he saw
this, and it really

00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:43.850
changed his view of
the world because he

00:36:43.850 --> 00:36:48.690
was able to really think
about it and go into school

00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:53.110
and talk to his friends and
stand up for this cause.

00:36:53.110 --> 00:36:57.520
And I think that was so powerful
because he was young and a boy,

00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:59.450
and you don't see that as often.

00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:01.949
And that's how it's happened
everywhere we've been.

00:37:01.949 --> 00:37:02.740
DARCI SIEGEL: Yeah.

00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:06.220
Like Eliza said, seeing all of
the reactions after the shows

00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:07.950
have been so powerful.

00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:10.060
Almost a year ago we went
to Fargo, North Dakota,

00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:11.370
to do a couple of shows.

00:37:11.370 --> 00:37:14.350
And we also had a Stop
Slut meeting at one

00:37:14.350 --> 00:37:15.520
of the local high schools.

00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:18.200
And something that
I will never forget

00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:21.360
is after one of the shows
we have a talk back where

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:24.150
the cast will come on stage
and we have the ability

00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:26.360
to have an open conversation
with the audience.

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:30.290
And we had this one
girl who was 16 or 17.

00:37:30.290 --> 00:37:33.080
And she stood up in
front of everyone.

00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:35.280
And she was crying,
and she was shaking.

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:39.940
And she told us that she
came to the realization

00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:42.950
after seeing the show that
an experience that she

00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:46.110
had had a couple
months before was rape.

00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:52.420
And she didn't fully comprehend
the magnitude of the issue

00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:53.680
until seeing "Slut."

00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:56.480
And when she came
forward and she

00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:58.580
talked about her truth
and her experience,

00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:02.130
a handful of other women also
came forward from the audience

00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:03.920
and told their stories.

00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:06.190
And what was really
incredible is

00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:09.690
that we had a lot of high
school students in the audience

00:38:09.690 --> 00:38:11.024
also that night.

00:38:11.024 --> 00:38:12.940
And the next day we went
to their high school,

00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:14.430
and they all came.

00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:17.160
And we sat down for
three or four hours

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:19.430
and just had a
conversation with them.

00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:22.100
And they were very
strong because they

00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:23.950
saw how this had
affected their peers,

00:38:23.950 --> 00:38:25.530
and they wanted
to make a change.

00:38:25.530 --> 00:38:27.260
So we sat and we
had a conversation.

00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:30.870
And they came up with the
plan that-- they were having

00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:32.520
their prom the next weekend.

00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:36.500
And they decided that when the
song "Blurred Lines" came on,

00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:38.860
they were all going to
try and get as many people

00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:41.160
as they could to walk
off the dance floor.

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:43.201
And we were flying
back to New York.

00:38:43.201 --> 00:38:44.700
And I remember, I
got off the plane,

00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:45.920
and I turned my phone on.

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:48.770
And I got a text from one
of the girls from Fargo.

00:38:48.770 --> 00:38:50.895
And she texted me,
oh my gosh, Darci,

00:38:50.895 --> 00:38:52.270
you'll never guess
what happened.

00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:54.820
So we had our prom,
and half of our grade

00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:58.010
walked off the dance floor
when "Blurred Lines" came on.

00:38:58.010 --> 00:39:02.730
And it made me so proud seeing
the impact that "Slut" has.

00:39:02.730 --> 00:39:05.150
Because when you provide
people with the space

00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:07.705
and with the platform to
have these conversations,

00:39:07.705 --> 00:39:09.330
they're ready to have
the conversations

00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:11.350
and they're ready
to take action.

00:39:11.350 --> 00:39:14.720
EMILY MORTIMER: And I love
how a lot of the conversations

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:18.010
seem to be between
boys and girls

00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:21.750
and that boys seemed to be
very interested in having

00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:23.740
the conversation too
because they're just

00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:26.290
as confused as the girls are.

00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:31.830
And Fred is our
brave boy here who

00:39:31.830 --> 00:39:35.110
shared his story so
eloquently and so brilliantly.

00:39:35.110 --> 00:39:43.460
And I'd love to
know what you think

00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:45.910
about the importance
of guys being part

00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:49.031
of this movement and all that.

00:39:49.031 --> 00:39:49.530
FRED: Yeah.

00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:52.400
So obviously everybody
is involved with it,

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:55.130
meaning that for the
movement to work everyone

00:39:55.130 --> 00:39:57.240
should be involved in it.

00:39:57.240 --> 00:40:01.480
So it's like, there's
pressures on both ends,

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:04.070
and there's limitations
on both ends.

00:40:04.070 --> 00:40:06.130
If I go to a party,
I don't want to feel

00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:08.090
like I have to make the
first move every time.

00:40:08.090 --> 00:40:10.480
Or like, if I'm walking
with a friend of mine

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:14.490
and then someone walks by, I
don't feel like I have to say,

00:40:14.490 --> 00:40:18.840
to prove to him, oh,
she's hot or something.

00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:22.195
The way that its works is
that-- because we're all

00:40:22.195 --> 00:40:24.070
talking about conversation,
and that's what's

00:40:24.070 --> 00:40:26.270
important, at least
in this point.

00:40:26.270 --> 00:40:28.070
The first thing is
just to talk, to be

00:40:28.070 --> 00:40:30.515
able-- not to even say,
oh, it should be this

00:40:30.515 --> 00:40:31.890
or it should be
that, but to just

00:40:31.890 --> 00:40:35.770
say, my personal reaction to
this is this, And you know,

00:40:35.770 --> 00:40:36.850
a real experience.

00:40:36.850 --> 00:40:41.500
And so many people-- it's built
in this hesitation to do that.

00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:44.690
And it's built in this
way to kind of not

00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:46.440
have to-- you don't
want to talk about it.

00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:48.890
And it's really hard to make
that jump to consciousness,

00:40:48.890 --> 00:40:51.669
to be like, hey, let's
have this conversation.

00:40:51.669 --> 00:40:52.210
I don't know.

00:40:52.210 --> 00:40:54.730
I was, like, really
nervous to even do

00:40:54.730 --> 00:40:59.930
this, because it's Google and
it's on YouTube or whatever.

00:40:59.930 --> 00:41:03.020
But still, the reason
that I wrote that

00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:05.170
was because I saw the play.

00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:08.450
And it's this thing
where, like, we

00:41:08.450 --> 00:41:10.460
shouldn't be telling
people what to think.

00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:12.770
We should just say,
this is my experience.

00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:15.350
And once you do, that's
empowering to other people

00:41:15.350 --> 00:41:16.600
to then be able to talk about.

00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:18.582
So I think it really
involves everybody, yeah.

00:41:18.582 --> 00:41:19.582
EMILY MORTIMER: Awesome.

00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:25.255
Have you guys got questions?

00:41:25.255 --> 00:41:25.880
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:27.921
EMILY MORTIMER: That's
why you're standing there?

00:41:27.921 --> 00:41:29.500
Yeah.

00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:32.444
So ask away.

00:41:32.444 --> 00:41:33.110
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:34.568
This is how we
usually do it, but I

00:41:34.568 --> 00:41:36.881
don't think we ever said that.

00:41:36.881 --> 00:41:38.630
But thank you guys so
much for being here.

00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:40.171
It was a really
powerful performance,

00:41:40.171 --> 00:41:41.410
and the readings were great.

00:41:41.410 --> 00:41:45.040
Kind of on that last point,
I struggle with this issue

00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:47.780
because I feel like people who
elect to come to these events

00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:49.370
are people who already get it.

00:41:49.370 --> 00:41:51.496
How do you get people who
don't get it yet to come?

00:41:51.496 --> 00:41:53.536
And Eliza, I loved your
story about your brother.

00:41:53.536 --> 00:41:54.380
That's so powerful.

00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:56.200
And Fred, was it?

00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:57.510
I loved that you're here too.

00:41:57.510 --> 00:42:00.509
And how do we get
more allies in?

00:42:00.509 --> 00:42:02.300
KATIE CAPPIELLO: You
know, it's interesting

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:03.890
because we have the
same conversation.

00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:06.190
And it is definitely
one of the reasons

00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:08.460
why we titled our play "Slut."

00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:11.765
Lots of high school kids want
to see a play called "Slut."

00:42:11.765 --> 00:42:15.370
It's not like, Joey's bad
night where things went wrong.

00:42:15.370 --> 00:42:17.270
You know, not to
lighten it, but when

00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:20.180
we had early conversations about
how we should title this play,

00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:22.450
we were like, let's
pack a punch here.

00:42:22.450 --> 00:42:24.300
Let's get the kids in.

00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:28.880
We also find the key
is just inviting them.

00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:32.580
Seriously, Fred's the
lone guy here today--

00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:34.620
obviously meaning on this stage.

00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:37.860
But there are so many boys
that are in this audience.

00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:42.276
The audience without fail
is always 50-50 male-female.

00:42:42.276 --> 00:42:43.400
Boys come out to this play.

00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:44.860
They want to talk
about this play.

00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:46.720
They want to talk
about the issues.

00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:49.930
And we found it's just
a matter of sending them

00:42:49.930 --> 00:42:52.720
a text and Facebook
inviting them.

00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:55.320
You know, the girls
get on their phones

00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:57.070
and they get on Snapchat,
and they're just

00:42:57.070 --> 00:42:58.010
inviting everybody.

00:42:58.010 --> 00:42:59.593
And they actually
show up because it's

00:42:59.593 --> 00:43:00.940
the thing to do Saturday night.

00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:01.597
No, it's weird.

00:43:01.597 --> 00:43:03.680
It's like, this feminist
play has become the thing

00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:06.610
to do on a Friday night.

00:43:06.610 --> 00:43:08.440
And it's also--
one of the schools

00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:10.220
that we're going
to-- we're doing

00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:12.850
a workshop at a high school
here in New York City.

00:43:12.850 --> 00:43:16.540
And he's awesome, the dean
of the school was like,

00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:18.580
oh no, we're going
to force them.

00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:21.450
Everyone's just going
to be required to go.

00:43:21.450 --> 00:43:24.440
Because that's the way to
get it going, you know.

00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:26.280
It's just, you kind
of have to be dragged,

00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:28.280
and then you realize
you actually like it.

00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:30.784
And then conversation starts.

00:43:30.784 --> 00:43:32.700
EMILY MORTIMER: And also,
speaking for myself,

00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:36.960
I think that everybody
needs educating

00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:39.540
about this more than
they think they do,

00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:44.670
even the people who
think they understand it.

00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:46.240
Like, I would think
that I would be

00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:50.250
somebody that would be very
sort of open-minded about all

00:43:50.250 --> 00:43:51.160
this stuff.

00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:55.290
But I realized in talking
to Katie that there's

00:43:55.290 --> 00:43:58.380
so much that I still don't
know and still don't understand

00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:01.930
about sexual politics,
gender politics,

00:44:01.930 --> 00:44:04.770
about what really goes on
between boys and girls.

00:44:04.770 --> 00:44:08.380
And I think if
that's true for me,

00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:11.304
it must be true for
loads of people.

00:44:11.304 --> 00:44:13.220
KATIE CAPPIELLO: And I
think the other thing--

00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:14.095
oh, Winnie, go ahead.

00:44:14.095 --> 00:44:16.178
WINNIFRED BONJEAN-ALPART:
I was just going to say,

00:44:16.178 --> 00:44:18.630
and that's also the great
thing about it being theater.

00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:22.937
It's not a lecture about slut
shaming and sexual shaming.

00:44:22.937 --> 00:44:24.520
It's not really
preaching to the choir

00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:28.300
when it's a really magnificent,
entertaining piece of theater

00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:32.420
that people should want to
see whether they're educated

00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:33.770
about the issue or not.

00:44:33.770 --> 00:44:35.810
And I think that that's
what we've seen a lot.

00:44:35.810 --> 00:44:39.300
A lot of people come to see the
show because it's a great show.

00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:40.030
It is.

00:44:40.030 --> 00:44:43.120
And I find that
especially, a lot

00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:44.840
of the girls that
come to see it really

00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:47.090
identify with it wholeheartedly.

00:44:47.090 --> 00:44:51.020
And then interestingly, when
the boys come to see it,

00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:54.510
it's a lot more like-- they're
always a little bit more

00:44:54.510 --> 00:44:56.060
shaken up when it's over.

00:44:56.060 --> 00:45:00.000
I know that my friends that have
come to see it who are boys,

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.250
it's always weird between
us after they see it.

00:45:04.250 --> 00:45:06.520
They feel like they want
to, like, hug me but they

00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:08.800
don't want to touch me.

00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:10.530
And I remember--
I remember I once

00:45:10.530 --> 00:45:14.560
had one of my closest male
friends come to see it,

00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:16.550
and he didn't know what
to say to me sort of.

00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:18.300
And I was like, well,
what did you think?

00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:18.920
How was it?

00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:25.781
And he was like, I just--
I feel some type of way.

00:45:25.781 --> 00:45:27.460
And I was like, oh, OK.

00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:31.080
And he was like, um, I just
need to think for a while.

00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:32.540
It was-- I don't know.

00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:35.190
So I find that a lot of
people that come to see it

00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:36.262
have that reaction.

00:45:36.262 --> 00:45:37.720
KATIE CAPPIELLO:
And I think we got

00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:40.851
some serious street cred too
because we didn't water it

00:45:40.851 --> 00:45:41.350
down.

00:45:41.350 --> 00:45:42.844
And that's because
of these guys.

00:45:42.844 --> 00:45:44.760
There was no way we
weren't going to say fuck,

00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:46.410
and there was no way we
weren't going to say pussy.

00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:48.070
And there was no way we weren't
going to actually describe

00:45:48.070 --> 00:45:51.180
what actually happens to a
girl when she's being violated.

00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:53.660
We're not going to
pull punches on that

00:45:53.660 --> 00:45:54.960
because it's enough already.

00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:58.430
Like, people are pulling
punches too much.

00:45:58.430 --> 00:46:03.470
So it started to spread that
we were actually going there.

00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:05.430
FRED: And then also
this idea, then,

00:46:05.430 --> 00:46:07.430
once they're in
there, how to get

00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:09.910
it is, if you do it
in this very real way,

00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:12.340
it's based on this idea that
I actually think is true.

00:46:12.340 --> 00:46:13.990
Once you see
something, you're going

00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:16.677
to understand more about
what's going through it,

00:46:16.677 --> 00:46:18.260
and you're going to
have more empathy.

00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:20.051
And you're going to
learn, not if someone's

00:46:20.051 --> 00:46:22.593
telling you a thesis or telling
you this is the way, but by--

00:46:22.593 --> 00:46:24.175
WINNIFRED BONJEAN-ALPART:
You feel it.

00:46:24.175 --> 00:46:26.040
FRED: Yeah, by feeling art.

00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:29.090
It's an advantage
to art as activism

00:46:29.090 --> 00:46:31.255
and that once you come
here, you understand

00:46:31.255 --> 00:46:32.380
what they're going through.

00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:34.770
And then it just makes
more sense that way.

00:46:34.770 --> 00:46:35.820
MEGAN MCINERNEY: And it
gives us a permission

00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:37.960
to share stories that we
often don't hear, right?

00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:39.550
So for the first
time, we actually

00:46:39.550 --> 00:46:42.770
get to hear from Joey, the
survivor, a victim of rape,

00:46:42.770 --> 00:46:44.662
when so often in these
circumstances that

00:46:44.662 --> 00:46:46.870
are happening in real life--
whether in Steubenville,

00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:49.495
right, or other cases around the
country that we hear about all

00:46:49.495 --> 00:46:52.320
the time, we don't get to
hear from the survivor--

00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:53.880
for a number of reasons, right?

00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:55.610
And this time, theater
gives us a chance

00:46:55.610 --> 00:46:58.190
to actually hear her voice, to
hear what actually happened,

00:46:58.190 --> 00:46:59.860
to have to look
at her in the face

00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:02.920
and see the reality of
how this is affecting her.

00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:04.810
It changes you.

00:47:04.810 --> 00:47:06.724
EMILY MORTIMER: Next question.

00:47:06.724 --> 00:47:08.390
AUDIENCE: Thank you
guys for being here.

00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:11.950
Thank you for making this.

00:47:11.950 --> 00:47:15.100
My niece turns 11 this week.

00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:25.940
Emily, you mentioned an
11-year-old son, I believe.

00:47:25.940 --> 00:47:27.920
You mentioned 11 to
20 for your chapters

00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:31.310
and for your group--
that's your target age.

00:47:31.310 --> 00:47:34.240
The idea that an
11-year-old has to stand up

00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:36.810
for herself or an
11-year-old boy

00:47:36.810 --> 00:47:38.750
has to be educated
about things he says

00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:42.120
or what his friends are saying--
that just-- it makes me,

00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:43.530
it makes me sad.

00:47:43.530 --> 00:47:46.670
It makes me mad.

00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:49.000
Could you just talk a
little bit about how

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:53.120
you craft your message and
your program to kids so young?

00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:54.780
You talked about
the girl-- was it

00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:57.920
North Dakota-- where she
realized what had happened

00:47:57.920 --> 00:47:59.180
to her, had been raped.

00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:01.290
And Fred, in your
piece you talked

00:48:01.290 --> 00:48:03.170
about guys were talking
about porn at school,

00:48:03.170 --> 00:48:06.700
and you had to go on
Google and be like, oh, ew.

00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:09.600
So if you could just talk
a little bit about that,

00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:11.490
that would be helpful.

00:48:11.490 --> 00:48:13.730
MEGAN MCINERNEY: I think
we have to acknowledge

00:48:13.730 --> 00:48:16.680
that 11-year-olds do know
what the word slut is,

00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:20.850
or a variation of that,
that it is affecting them

00:48:20.850 --> 00:48:22.940
and we have to be
realistic about that.

00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:25.120
So we actually have a
sixth grader who's 11.

00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:27.510
She's one of our youngest
Stop Slut coalition members.

00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:31.460
And she has a friend who
was going out with a boy.

00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:33.590
And they were, you
know, holding hands.

00:48:33.590 --> 00:48:36.640
And then she decided she didn't
want go out with him anymore.

00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:38.440
And so the boy got really upset.

00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:41.530
And he got the rest of
his peers in the class

00:48:41.530 --> 00:48:44.830
to start calling her a thot.

00:48:44.830 --> 00:48:47.190
And on the playground,
they started

00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:50.010
going thot alert, thot
alert, thot alert,

00:48:50.010 --> 00:48:51.620
every time she walked around.

00:48:51.620 --> 00:48:54.720
And a thought, in case you don't
know, is That Ho Over There.

00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:57.330
So it's another
derivation of slut.

00:48:57.330 --> 00:49:00.690
And the girl was devastated.

00:49:00.690 --> 00:49:01.800
And she's 11.

00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:04.140
So we can't say
that 11-year-olds

00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:06.100
aren't being impacted
by this culture, right?

00:49:06.100 --> 00:49:09.680
It's slightly maybe different
than what high school students

00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:11.777
are facing, but they
are experiencing

00:49:11.777 --> 00:49:12.860
the ramifications of this.

00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:15.700
And so we have to be willing
and courageous enough

00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:17.120
to talk about that reality.

00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:18.330
KATIE CAPPIELLO: And
what's so amazing is

00:49:18.330 --> 00:49:20.788
that we hear this from middle
school students all the time,

00:49:20.788 --> 00:49:24.370
and actually from kids in
fifth grade and fourth grade,

00:49:24.370 --> 00:49:25.330
obviously.

00:49:25.330 --> 00:49:27.940
And what's always
fascinating to us

00:49:27.940 --> 00:49:29.240
is how the school handles it.

00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:32.100
So the girl will go and be like,
they were saying thot alert,

00:49:32.100 --> 00:49:34.620
or I'm a whole according
to James in my class.

00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:36.080
And I don't know what to do.

00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:38.450
And these teachers
are always like, well,

00:49:38.450 --> 00:49:40.850
James, that is
really inappropriate

00:49:40.850 --> 00:49:42.400
and I need you to
say you're sorry.

00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:46.570
And never, ever, do they sit and
have a conversation about why

00:49:46.570 --> 00:49:49.240
calling this girl a thot
or a whore or a slut

00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:50.390
is inappropriate.

00:49:50.390 --> 00:49:52.850
This word inappropriate gets
thrown around in middle school

00:49:52.850 --> 00:49:56.390
like you would not believe, and
no one asks the question why?

00:49:56.390 --> 00:50:00.470
So what we do in our program
is everything is about why.

00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:02.620
So every time we say
something, it's about why.

00:50:02.620 --> 00:50:04.952
So when Winnifred
was talking about

00:50:04.952 --> 00:50:06.920
can girls reclaim the word slut?

00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:09.230
Well, when we first started
developing this play,

00:50:09.230 --> 00:50:11.160
we did experiment
with that possibility.

00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:13.730
And then we kept asking
the question why.

00:50:13.730 --> 00:50:17.520
And we started to realize, well,
no, we can't because no matter

00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:19.210
what, it always backfires.

00:50:19.210 --> 00:50:22.090
It just without fail backfires.

00:50:22.090 --> 00:50:24.430
And so what we need
schools to start

00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:28.150
doing is letting the kids
talk, actually hearing

00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:31.770
what they're saying, not telling
them things are inappropriate.

00:50:31.770 --> 00:50:36.860
And actually then digging deep
and unpacking it and having

00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:38.010
a conversation about why.

00:50:38.010 --> 00:50:39.650
Why do you think
you call her that?

00:50:39.650 --> 00:50:43.460
Where does a sixth grade boy
learn to call this girl a thot?

00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:45.170
Does he even know
what that means?

00:50:45.170 --> 00:50:45.670
No.

00:50:45.670 --> 00:50:46.940
MEGAN MCINERNEY: And it's all
the adults in their lives,

00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:47.130
right?

00:50:47.130 --> 00:50:48.796
So their teachers but
also their parents

00:50:48.796 --> 00:50:51.532
and their uncles and their
aunts and religious leaders

00:50:51.532 --> 00:50:53.240
and whoever the adults
are in their lives

00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:54.150
taking them seriously.

00:50:54.150 --> 00:50:56.358
It's like we were saying
before, they're the experts.

00:50:56.358 --> 00:50:57.550
They really do understand.

00:50:57.550 --> 00:50:59.430
Young people are smart,
and they understand

00:50:59.430 --> 00:51:00.470
what's going on in their lives.

00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:02.500
And so we have to be able
to give them the platform

00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:04.310
to be able to speak
honestly and truthfully

00:51:04.310 --> 00:51:05.950
and know that we're not
going to judge them,

00:51:05.950 --> 00:51:07.492
we're not going to
look down on them,

00:51:07.492 --> 00:51:09.283
but we're going to
actually listen and then

00:51:09.283 --> 00:51:11.340
help give them the tools
that they need to create

00:51:11.340 --> 00:51:12.500
the change that they want.

00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:13.630
KATIE CAPPIELLO:
Ask a sixth grader

00:51:13.630 --> 00:51:15.030
or a fifth grader that you
know, or a fourth grader,

00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:16.904
or maybe even a third
grader, if they've ever

00:51:16.904 --> 00:51:19.190
heard the word slut
or whore or ho,

00:51:19.190 --> 00:51:20.600
and they will tell you, yes.

00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:22.640
Except no one's
ever asking them.

00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:24.837
No one's asking kids
that age, right?

00:51:24.837 --> 00:51:26.170
So that's a part of the problem.

00:51:26.170 --> 00:51:27.940
And when you get to
the high school level,

00:51:27.940 --> 00:51:29.700
high schools don't want to
talk about slut shaming.

00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:31.040
They don't want to talk
about rape culture.

00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:33.498
They'll talk about bullying,
but they won't talk about this

00:51:33.498 --> 00:51:34.660
because this involves sex.

00:51:34.660 --> 00:51:36.950
And no one wants to
think that kids this age

00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:42.340
are engaging in sex,
because God forbid, right.

00:51:42.340 --> 00:51:44.118
EMILY MORTIMER: Next question.

00:51:44.118 --> 00:51:44.990
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:51:44.990 --> 00:51:47.460
That was really
fantastic, impressive.

00:51:47.460 --> 00:51:49.500
And I'm really excited
about these stories

00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:53.110
of change in places that you've
been going and doing this play.

00:51:53.110 --> 00:51:54.610
It's great to hear.

00:51:54.610 --> 00:51:57.180
I don't suspect you have an
Australian tour coming up

00:51:57.180 --> 00:51:58.400
any time soon?

00:51:58.400 --> 00:51:59.650
KATIE CAPPIELLO: We'd love it.

00:51:59.650 --> 00:51:59.950
MEGAN MCINERNEY: Yeah.

00:51:59.950 --> 00:52:00.670
KATIE CAPPIELLO: We'd love it.

00:52:00.670 --> 00:52:01.110
MEGAN MCINERNEY:
Make that happen.

00:52:01.110 --> 00:52:02.735
KATIE CAPPIELLO: Make
some connections.

00:52:04.591 --> 00:52:06.340
AUDIENCE: So similar
to the last question,

00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:08.190
I have a 10-year-old sister.

00:52:08.190 --> 00:52:11.010
And I'm terrified of
her going to high school

00:52:11.010 --> 00:52:12.930
in a couple of years
and having to deal

00:52:12.930 --> 00:52:15.230
with the immense
social pressures

00:52:15.230 --> 00:52:18.950
from girls, from boys, from
adults, from music videos,

00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:20.725
from the way we market
toys to children.

00:52:20.725 --> 00:52:23.370
It's disgusting.

00:52:23.370 --> 00:52:26.050
And so I'm wondering,
do you guys

00:52:26.050 --> 00:52:30.070
have recommendations on how to
talk to young girls about this

00:52:30.070 --> 00:52:32.310
and to make sure
that they understand

00:52:32.310 --> 00:52:33.789
all the support they have?

00:52:33.789 --> 00:52:36.080
EMILY MORTIMER: I was going
to ask Odley that question,

00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:40.190
because I didn't get to ask
my question earlier to her.

00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:42.460
In fact, I was going
to say the same thing.

00:52:42.460 --> 00:52:46.520
What would you tell
your 10-year-old self

00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:50.840
about to enter into big school?

00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:52.420
How would you prepare her?

00:52:52.420 --> 00:52:54.030
ODLEY: First thing
I would tell myself

00:52:54.030 --> 00:53:00.000
is, it's not fun to have
champagne poured in your face.

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.980
No, the first thing I
would have really, really

00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:06.960
took my time to repeat
to myself is be yourself.

00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:09.580
You don't have to-- often
girls do most things

00:53:09.580 --> 00:53:13.820
because other girls are doing it
or they want a guy's attention.

00:53:13.820 --> 00:53:16.410
And the big thing is,
you have to be yourself,

00:53:16.410 --> 00:53:21.340
whether you like dancing or
twerking around, then go ahead

00:53:21.340 --> 00:53:21.850
and do it.

00:53:21.850 --> 00:53:25.570
But don't do it to get
somebody's attention, you know.

00:53:25.570 --> 00:53:27.780
Just be yourself
100%, and that's

00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:32.349
what we need to remember
most of the time.

00:53:32.349 --> 00:53:33.890
DARCI SIEGEL: I
mean, just growing up

00:53:33.890 --> 00:53:35.650
as a teen in this
generation with all

00:53:35.650 --> 00:53:39.330
of these influences of media
that have been surrounding

00:53:39.330 --> 00:53:43.380
us-- there's a really huge
dichotomy between being

00:53:43.380 --> 00:53:46.270
a sexual person and being
a smart person, right.

00:53:46.270 --> 00:53:49.980
So you can either be a
really empowered person

00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:53.890
who loves your body, or
you can be a smart person.

00:53:53.890 --> 00:53:58.020
And you can't-- they've made
it so that you can't be both.

00:53:58.020 --> 00:54:00.240
And by "they," I mean society
because you can either

00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:03.680
be really sexual-- you can
embrace your sexuality,

00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:06.210
but if you embrace it,
then you can be a slut

00:54:06.210 --> 00:54:08.660
or you can be somewhat
more conservative.

00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:11.720
But if you're more conservative
then you're a prude.

00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:16.530
And there are just so many
ways where you can be one

00:54:16.530 --> 00:54:18.300
but then you can't be the other.

00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:20.020
And what I would
tell younger me,

00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:22.320
and what I'm still even
telling myself now, is that I

00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:24.200
can embrace both, you know.

00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:27.780
So you can tell your
11-year-old sister

00:54:27.780 --> 00:54:30.620
that it's OK to feel
good about yourself

00:54:30.620 --> 00:54:32.150
and to feel good
about your body,

00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:33.570
and you can also be smart.

00:54:33.570 --> 00:54:37.210
So just embrace it and don't
let other people tell you

00:54:37.210 --> 00:54:38.544
that what you're doing is wrong.

00:54:38.544 --> 00:54:41.168
WINNIFRED BONJEAN-ALPART: May I
quickly say also about the word

00:54:41.168 --> 00:54:42.260
"slut," in particular.

00:54:42.260 --> 00:54:45.330
I think for me, the first time
I remember someone calling me

00:54:45.330 --> 00:54:48.240
a slut, I was probably 10 or 11.

00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:52.780
And at the time there was no
sexual connotation, really.

00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:54.650
I mean, I was really
disassociated,

00:54:54.650 --> 00:54:59.410
because honestly now for me,
there isn't really that either.

00:54:59.410 --> 00:55:03.400
It has always been a word that
is used to dehumanize, degrade,

00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:05.830
and demean someone, make
someone feel like trash.

00:55:05.830 --> 00:55:07.970
And that is its
effect, regardless

00:55:07.970 --> 00:55:11.700
of your sexual history.

00:55:11.700 --> 00:55:13.820
I mean, when I was 10, I
had never kissed a boy,

00:55:13.820 --> 00:55:15.750
but the word felt really bad.

00:55:15.750 --> 00:55:18.350
So I think that's how you
address it with young people.

00:55:18.350 --> 00:55:20.310
They know that the
word feels bad,

00:55:20.310 --> 00:55:22.340
and that's pretty much
all there is to it.

00:55:22.340 --> 00:55:25.910
The reason why it
feels bad is because it

00:55:25.910 --> 00:55:27.160
makes you feel worthless.

00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:29.880
And honestly, there is
no other word like that.

00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:34.606
The word bitch, the word
cunt-- those words are nothing

00:55:34.606 --> 00:55:36.230
like the word slut,
because to me, it's

00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:38.860
the only word that actually
makes you feel like trash

00:55:38.860 --> 00:55:41.380
and then therefore it
becomes really problematic

00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:43.430
because you can do
anything you want

00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:47.260
to trash without
any consequences.

00:55:47.260 --> 00:55:49.330
So it's all like--

00:55:49.330 --> 00:55:51.790
FRED: Yeah, to be called,
even on the other side,

00:55:51.790 --> 00:55:56.810
like "pussy" or "fag," those
don't mean what they mean.

00:55:56.810 --> 00:56:00.919
We're taking this kind of
jealousy and this anger

00:56:00.919 --> 00:56:03.210
that we have and we're putting
it into something that's

00:56:03.210 --> 00:56:06.330
already so taboo that
we don't know what

00:56:06.330 --> 00:56:08.940
it is because no one's talking
about it-- meaning that,

00:56:08.940 --> 00:56:12.520
then, oh, so then put this
there and then-- yeah.

00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:15.020
KATIE CAPPIELLO: And I think
with your sister, so much of it

00:56:15.020 --> 00:56:17.080
is just is modeling too.

00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:20.790
I think people don't even
realize how often they say this

00:56:20.790 --> 00:56:24.020
word or how often they'll just
be like, ah, she's-- like,

00:56:24.020 --> 00:56:25.540
why is she even
acting like that?

00:56:25.540 --> 00:56:28.230
Like, she's such trash,
or she's such a whore.

00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:30.250
We just do it so flippantly.

00:56:30.250 --> 00:56:34.330
And I actually had this really
cool chat with Fred's mom.

00:56:34.330 --> 00:56:37.290
And she was just like,
oh shit, and making

00:56:37.290 --> 00:56:39.700
me realize all the things
I said over the years

00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:41.210
that were really degrading.

00:56:41.210 --> 00:56:42.730
And I'm doing it
in front of my kid

00:56:42.730 --> 00:56:46.220
who's modeling his
behavior off mine.

00:56:46.220 --> 00:56:50.360
And so much of what we see
with kids slut shaming one

00:56:50.360 --> 00:56:53.160
another we see parents doing.

00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:54.080
Not kidding.

00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:55.740
We see parents doing
it to other girls.

00:56:59.060 --> 00:57:01.460
This play is based off
a lot of real events.

00:57:01.460 --> 00:57:05.510
And in a particular
event in this play,

00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:08.190
a mom that we are
very close with,

00:57:08.190 --> 00:57:10.800
who prides herself on being a
feminist, who we would agree

00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:14.369
is a really great person, came
up to me and was like, I mean,

00:57:14.369 --> 00:57:15.410
do you believe this girl?

00:57:15.410 --> 00:57:16.868
I mean, come on,
she's such a slut.

00:57:16.868 --> 00:57:17.800
She's such a liar.

00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:18.841
And you're sitting there.

00:57:18.841 --> 00:57:20.850
And you're just like,
is she even thinking?

00:57:20.850 --> 00:57:22.290
And I know she said
that to her daughter.

00:57:22.290 --> 00:57:23.530
I know her daughter
told her friends.

00:57:23.530 --> 00:57:26.020
I know they're saying that
at the PTA meeting, for real.

00:57:26.020 --> 00:57:29.000
And so it's what we're
modeling, you know.

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:30.920
And it's also just,
bring up the word.

00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:32.780
Have you ever heard
this word before?

00:57:32.780 --> 00:57:35.100
Have you ever heard
these things before?

00:57:35.100 --> 00:57:37.210
And let her know that
you're willing to have

00:57:37.210 --> 00:57:38.020
an open dialogue.

00:57:38.020 --> 00:57:39.300
Most kids don't
feel like anyone's

00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:40.110
willing to talk
about it with them.

00:57:40.110 --> 00:57:43.020
And if they do, it means
they're bad, especially girls.

00:57:43.020 --> 00:57:44.000
They always feel bad.

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:45.166
Like, they're bad and dirty.

00:57:47.630 --> 00:57:48.880
EMILY MORTIMER: Next question.

00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:53.379
AUDIENCE: So on the one hand,
media like pornography or music

00:57:53.379 --> 00:57:55.920
videos like "Big Pimpin'," maybe
they have some negative side

00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:58.170
effects when people are
watching too many of them.

00:57:58.170 --> 00:58:00.830
On the other hand, people
have a right to free speech.

00:58:00.830 --> 00:58:04.990
So how do we maybe stop
people from consuming

00:58:04.990 --> 00:58:10.890
as much media that is degrading
to women or other people?

00:58:10.890 --> 00:58:13.330
What's the solution to
that balance of free speech

00:58:13.330 --> 00:58:15.800
and negative side effects.

00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:17.320
FRED: So I wrote
that a year ago,

00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:18.695
and then they told
me to read it.

00:58:18.695 --> 00:58:20.339
And I was also nervous
because I don't

00:58:20.339 --> 00:58:21.880
want to tell people
what not to make,

00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:24.339
and there should be videos
of people having sex.

00:58:24.339 --> 00:58:26.130
Like, that should be
something that someone

00:58:26.130 --> 00:58:27.860
can access and look at.

00:58:27.860 --> 00:58:30.950
I think it's not
that we're telling

00:58:30.950 --> 00:58:32.570
"Big Pimpin'" not to be made.

00:58:35.210 --> 00:58:37.990
We're not doing that, but we're
exercising our free speech

00:58:37.990 --> 00:58:42.120
to say, personally, to me,
this is what I think of that.

00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:44.710
So like, whatever
music video is made,

00:58:44.710 --> 00:58:47.320
we're not telling the writer--
they should, you know,

00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:50.570
write whatever they want and
exercise that free speech as

00:58:50.570 --> 00:58:51.560
much as they want.

00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:54.610
It's just, by doing that,
we have the same free speech

00:58:54.610 --> 00:58:58.920
to say that affected
this thing in a way

00:58:58.920 --> 00:59:01.010
that I don't like how it looked.

00:59:01.010 --> 00:59:04.740
And then maybe if they heard
that and maybe if we talked,

00:59:04.740 --> 00:59:06.640
they could still
make it, but they

00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:08.240
have a different
understanding of it.

00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:12.350
So in no way is it
saying stop doing this.

00:59:12.350 --> 00:59:14.526
It's just saying, your
very personal thing, this

00:59:14.526 --> 00:59:15.400
is how it affects me.

00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:17.510
EMILY MORTIMER: Yeah,
or like the guys

00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:21.150
at the high school refusing
to dance to "Blurred Lines."

00:59:21.150 --> 00:59:23.340
They're not saying that
shouldn't be published

00:59:23.340 --> 00:59:25.920
as a record, but we
don't like the feeling

00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:28.800
of-- but that was a really
interesting one, I thought,

00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:31.910
that "Blurred Lines"
video and the song

00:59:31.910 --> 00:59:35.270
because there was something
very kind of viscerally

00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:38.680
weirdly appealing about
it, even as a woman.

00:59:38.680 --> 00:59:41.880
It was like, this
guy was sort of being

00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:46.760
so overt in a way that you
couldn't tell whether it

00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:48.630
was ironic or what it was.

00:59:48.630 --> 00:59:51.490
But there was something kind
of-- you were drawn to it.

00:59:51.490 --> 00:59:55.925
And I feel that the confusion
around things like that

00:59:55.925 --> 00:59:59.250
is something that you guys-- and
then when you think about it,

00:59:59.250 --> 01:00:00.840
you think, this
is just horrible.

01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:01.750
I hate this song.

01:00:01.750 --> 01:00:03.394
I hate this video.

01:00:03.394 --> 01:00:05.310
But there's something
very compelling about it

01:00:05.310 --> 01:00:06.050
at the same time.

01:00:06.050 --> 01:00:08.730
And no wonder it was
a huge hit because it

01:00:08.730 --> 01:00:10.730
appeals to some part
of us that still

01:00:10.730 --> 01:00:12.800
hasn't been reconciled at all.

01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:15.740
And we're still very
un-reconstructed as a culture,

01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:17.900
even though we think we are.

01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:21.180
So I think that's an
excellent question.

01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:23.730
And there, we have an example
of people actually thinking

01:00:23.730 --> 01:00:26.380
about this song and
deciding to use their right

01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:27.779
to not dance to it.

01:00:27.779 --> 01:00:28.820
MEGAN MCINERNEY: Exactly.

01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:29.780
And I think that's
the whole point.

01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:32.600
If we can have a space where
we can actually stop for second

01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:34.980
and not just have
everything bombard us

01:00:34.980 --> 01:00:40.520
and be naive or keeping our eyes
open to how it's affecting us--

01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:42.590
that's part of the problem,
is that it's just all

01:00:42.590 --> 01:00:44.480
coming at us so
quickly, so quickly,

01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:48.240
especially with social media and
easy access to things like porn

01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:50.480
right now.

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:52.840
You're not even aware of
how it's affecting you.

01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:55.340
And so our position
is oftentimes,

01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:57.890
OK, let's just stop for a second
and have a conversation so

01:00:57.890 --> 01:01:00.880
that we can be more aware and
make our own personal decision

01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:03.009
if we want to continue
to consume this or not.

01:01:03.009 --> 01:01:04.300
WINNIFRED BONJEAN-ALPART: Yeah.

01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:07.390
And I think I also,
like, with free speech

01:01:07.390 --> 01:01:09.850
comes responsibility.

01:01:09.850 --> 01:01:14.490
And you can technically say
whatever you want to say,

01:01:14.490 --> 01:01:18.300
but with some knowledge of
how it's affecting others

01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:19.290
is really important.

01:01:19.290 --> 01:01:21.120
And I think a lot
of it, especially

01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:23.870
with porn, obviously it comes
down to supply and demand.

01:01:23.870 --> 01:01:30.020
So it's less about changing an
artist's perspective or goal

01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:35.140
in producing his porn, but
more about what we as a society

01:01:35.140 --> 01:01:42.170
value and how we
want to treat people.

01:01:42.170 --> 01:01:45.060
I mean, to me, like, the porn
industry is really specific.

01:01:45.060 --> 01:01:47.570
But I mean, it's the same
thing with music videos.

01:01:47.570 --> 01:01:49.170
I mean, it's a societal issue.

01:01:49.170 --> 01:01:54.230
So once we sort of change
the energy of our culture,

01:01:54.230 --> 01:01:58.230
then naturally art changes.

01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:02.570
EMILY MORTIMER: Thank you.

01:02:02.570 --> 01:02:04.516
Last two questions.

01:02:04.516 --> 01:02:06.390
AUDIENCE: So thank you
guys for coming today.

01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:07.931
I know you guys said
that you brought

01:02:07.931 --> 01:02:10.500
the play to a bunch of
different parts of the country.

01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:12.540
And some parts of the
country are probably

01:02:12.540 --> 01:02:15.540
a lot more conservative about
talking about sex and sex

01:02:15.540 --> 01:02:19.320
education, maybe for whatever
reasons, religious reasons.

01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:22.350
They may not go into it as in
depth at some other schools

01:02:22.350 --> 01:02:23.050
in the country.

01:02:23.050 --> 01:02:24.508
So did you guys
have an opportunity

01:02:24.508 --> 01:02:27.210
to visit these more
conservative areas?

01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:29.080
And if so, how were
their reactions?

01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:32.050
And were they different
depending on where you visited

01:02:32.050 --> 01:02:33.080
throughout the country?

01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:34.830
DARCI SIEGEL: Well,
when we went to Fargo,

01:02:34.830 --> 01:02:36.740
North Dakota-- I mean,
that's the Midwest.

01:02:36.740 --> 01:02:38.840
So it's pretty conservative.

01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:42.430
And before the show,
we were talking

01:02:42.430 --> 01:02:45.190
to some of the teens that were
waiting to go see the show.

01:02:45.190 --> 01:02:47.770
And we were talking about
their sex ed classes.

01:02:47.770 --> 01:02:50.790
And in the city-- I go to a
New York City public school,

01:02:50.790 --> 01:02:52.440
and so we do have health ed.

01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:56.930
And we have started to talk
about consent and about how

01:02:56.930 --> 01:03:02.100
to treat your interaction
with the opposite sex,

01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:04.271
and stuff like that.

01:03:04.271 --> 01:03:06.770
And when I went to Fargo, I was
talking to one of the girls.

01:03:06.770 --> 01:03:09.061
And I was talking to her,
and I was asking her, I said,

01:03:09.061 --> 01:03:11.010
what's your sex ed class like?

01:03:11.010 --> 01:03:13.060
And she goes, well,
actually, it's

01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:15.350
really funny that you asked
me that, because a couple

01:03:15.350 --> 01:03:18.660
weeks ago in sex ed we
played a game called

01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:20.180
who slept in your bed?

01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:24.785
And what they did is they put
a white sheet on the floor.

01:03:24.785 --> 01:03:26.410
And then everyone
sat around the sheet,

01:03:26.410 --> 01:03:30.100
and they had little pictures
of different characters.

01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:34.500
And there would be, like, Slutty
Amanda or like Herpes Harry,

01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:36.090
and all of these
different things

01:03:36.090 --> 01:03:39.280
that were geared towards
telling these students,

01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:42.190
don't have sex because these
are all of the things that's

01:03:42.190 --> 01:03:43.440
going to happen to you, right.

01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:46.720
You can be called a slut,
or you can get an STD.

01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:50.170
And the way that
it was constructed

01:03:50.170 --> 01:03:52.532
is just don't have sex because
all these bad things are

01:03:52.532 --> 01:03:53.490
going to happen to you.

01:03:53.490 --> 01:03:57.550
And what they don't do is
they don't prepare students

01:03:57.550 --> 01:04:00.660
with the conversation, with
the resources for those

01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:01.690
who do want to have sex.

01:04:01.690 --> 01:04:06.140
And so just when we
went and we started

01:04:06.140 --> 01:04:09.420
having an open
conversation with them,

01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:13.130
they were so eager to have these
conversations about sexuality

01:04:13.130 --> 01:04:17.800
and about slut
shaming and about sex.

01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:19.880
And so I just
think it was great.

01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:21.787
ELIZA PRICE: Yeah, I agree.

01:04:21.787 --> 01:04:23.370
And we have a line
earlier in the play

01:04:23.370 --> 01:04:26.050
that's talking about how
this woman's a Republican.

01:04:26.050 --> 01:04:28.590
And before we went
to Fargo, we were

01:04:28.590 --> 01:04:30.640
considering changing it
to like, oh, well, she's

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:31.870
so conservative.

01:04:31.870 --> 01:04:34.112
And then we didn't.

01:04:34.112 --> 01:04:39.202
And I thought that was so cool
because we didn't-- OK, sorry.

01:04:39.202 --> 01:04:40.910
Because if we changed
it to conservative,

01:04:40.910 --> 01:04:43.420
we'd be picking what
their reactions were going

01:04:43.420 --> 01:04:46.120
to be before we'd met
them and before we'd seen

01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:47.700
their response to the play.

01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:51.135
And so I remember, we were all
a little bit nervous before.

01:04:51.135 --> 01:04:52.260
Were they going to like it?

01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:53.350
Were they going to laugh?

01:04:53.350 --> 01:04:55.170
Were they going to be emotional?

01:04:55.170 --> 01:04:58.130
And it was so powerful.

01:04:58.130 --> 01:05:02.670
That was the most powerful place
I had been a part of the play

01:05:02.670 --> 01:05:06.060
because they reacted just
like they reacted in New York

01:05:06.060 --> 01:05:08.230
and LA-- even more
so because they don't

01:05:08.230 --> 01:05:10.760
have the same opportunities
to witness theater

01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:15.260
like we do or you guys do,
or to talk about it openly.

01:05:15.260 --> 01:05:19.190
And so it didn't really matter
that we had Republican in there

01:05:19.190 --> 01:05:21.290
or that we were
talking about sex.

01:05:21.290 --> 01:05:24.262
Because everybody goes
through the same things,

01:05:24.262 --> 01:05:26.720
and it was just so beautiful
to give them that opportunity.

01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:28.220
WINNIFRED BONJEAN-ALPART:
I think we

01:05:28.220 --> 01:05:30.190
as New Yorkers also
underestimate people

01:05:30.190 --> 01:05:31.620
all over the rest of the world.

01:05:31.620 --> 01:05:35.000
Like, they're
actually not that bad.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:38.790
I remember going there and being
like, oh my god, North Dakota--

01:05:38.790 --> 01:05:40.610
they're pilgrims.

01:05:40.610 --> 01:05:43.280
I don't know what's
going to happen.

01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:44.020
And I got there.

01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:47.760
And I mean, my part in
particular is pretty racy.

01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:52.150
And it was straight
faces, enthusiasm.

01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:52.980
People loved it.

01:05:52.980 --> 01:05:56.524
It was the same exact way as
it was here, as it was in LA.

01:05:56.524 --> 01:05:58.690
KATIE CAPPIELLO: We were
warned too, before we went.

01:05:58.690 --> 01:06:00.490
They were like,
listen, just prepare.

01:06:00.490 --> 01:06:02.030
There's going to be picketing.

01:06:02.030 --> 01:06:04.170
They are going to hate you.

01:06:04.170 --> 01:06:06.530
This is just
feminist propaganda.

01:06:06.530 --> 01:06:10.380
And we're like, oh my god, this
is going to be unbelievable.

01:06:10.380 --> 01:06:13.020
We were a little excited for it,
to be really honest with you.

01:06:13.020 --> 01:06:14.700
We were like, we're pumped.

01:06:14.700 --> 01:06:16.230
We were prepping on the plane.

01:06:16.230 --> 01:06:18.870
We were like, we're going
to say this in response.

01:06:18.870 --> 01:06:22.090
But I'm telling you, there
was a line around the block.

01:06:22.090 --> 01:06:23.480
This show sold out.

01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:27.100
And we're not talking just
teenagers-- parents, educators.

01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:29.390
The first high school,
the very first high school

01:06:29.390 --> 01:06:32.670
that welcomed us
into their halls

01:06:32.670 --> 01:06:36.470
to do a workshop about
rape and slut shaming

01:06:36.470 --> 01:06:38.880
was a little high school
in Moorhead, Minnesota,

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:40.260
you know what I mean?

01:06:40.260 --> 01:06:41.930
And it's Lutheran as it gets.

01:06:41.930 --> 01:06:44.370
So they want to
talk about it too.

01:06:44.370 --> 01:06:46.180
They just need access.

01:06:46.180 --> 01:06:47.180
We need to get in there.

01:06:47.180 --> 01:06:48.180
So we're working on it.

01:06:48.180 --> 01:06:49.814
So we're going to Boston.

01:06:49.814 --> 01:06:50.980
So we're excited about that.

01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:53.438
I mean, it's pretty East Coast,
pretty liberal and pretty--

01:06:53.438 --> 01:06:54.950
I mean, it'll be great.

01:06:54.950 --> 01:06:56.122
We're going to go to DC.

01:06:56.122 --> 01:06:57.330
We're going to San Francisco.

01:06:57.330 --> 01:06:59.950
And we're really,
really working hard

01:06:59.950 --> 01:07:03.415
for some Bible Belt situation.

01:07:03.415 --> 01:07:07.150
If you have any ideas,
please let us know.

01:07:07.150 --> 01:07:08.400
EMILY MORTIMER: Last question.

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:08.941
AUDIENCE: Hi.

01:07:08.941 --> 01:07:10.720
Thanks again for coming.

01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:13.720
I know you mentioned-- so you
focus on 11 to 20-year-olds

01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:15.151
for the conversations.

01:07:15.151 --> 01:07:17.650
I want to know, how can we have
those types of conversations

01:07:17.650 --> 01:07:19.860
for 20-plus, and how
can we kind of bridge

01:07:19.860 --> 01:07:24.810
that gap to help that education
be for the older crowd too?

01:07:24.810 --> 01:07:26.390
EMILY MORTIMER:
Very good question.

01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:28.390
MEGAN MCINERNEY: Just do
it is what I would say.

01:07:28.390 --> 01:07:30.306
I mean, it doesn't have
to be anything formal.

01:07:30.306 --> 01:07:31.970
I mean, we have
laid out in the book

01:07:31.970 --> 01:07:35.100
entire activist guide at the
end that Katie and I wrote

01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:38.580
that helps either with
questions to start off with

01:07:38.580 --> 01:07:41.310
to help guide the conversation,
or different plans of action

01:07:41.310 --> 01:07:43.268
that other people have
done around the country.

01:07:43.268 --> 01:07:45.114
But really, it doesn't
take much to just

01:07:45.114 --> 01:07:47.780
be able to sit down with a group
of friends over a cup of coffee

01:07:47.780 --> 01:07:49.730
and be like, all right,
let's talk about this.

01:07:49.730 --> 01:07:51.190
It's really effective.

01:07:51.190 --> 01:07:53.790
We've had so many conversations
with our adult friends.

01:07:53.790 --> 01:07:56.770
And it's just about sitting
around and being brave enough

01:07:56.770 --> 01:08:00.100
to start that dialogue
and to be honest about how

01:08:00.100 --> 01:08:00.892
it's affecting you.

01:08:00.892 --> 01:08:02.433
KATIE CAPPIELLO: I
think Google needs

01:08:02.433 --> 01:08:03.650
to start a Stop Slut chapter.

01:08:03.650 --> 01:08:03.910
MEGAN MCINERNEY: Yeah.

01:08:03.910 --> 01:08:05.660
KATIE CAPPIELLO: Are
you guys down for it?

01:08:05.660 --> 01:08:07.550
And there's one thing
that we find works

01:08:07.550 --> 01:08:09.000
that we have found works.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.200
It doesn't matter the age group.

01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:12.460
It's a writing exercise.

01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:16.762
And maybe that sounds a little
cheesy and a little college

01:08:16.762 --> 01:08:17.470
writing workshop.

01:08:17.470 --> 01:08:21.040
But we have a writing prompt
online that you can easily

01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:22.012
access and download.

01:08:22.012 --> 01:08:24.470
And we find, if you give someone
a second, if you give them

01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:27.149
seven minutes, all it takes
is seven minutes to sit there

01:08:27.149 --> 01:08:29.439
and actually think, oh, how
is this touching my life,

01:08:29.439 --> 01:08:31.340
you're going to start to
find all these things are

01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:32.130
going to come up.

01:08:32.130 --> 01:08:34.880
And it's not just things from
seventh grade or 10th grade.

01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:36.396
It's things from
your subway ride.

01:08:36.396 --> 01:08:37.270
You know what I mean?

01:08:37.270 --> 01:08:39.930
It's things from that
night at that get together

01:08:39.930 --> 01:08:41.399
two weeks ago, you know?

01:08:41.399 --> 01:08:44.330
I was at a party very recently
with a group of friends.

01:08:44.330 --> 01:08:46.854
And I'm sitting across this
gentleman who's 35-years-old

01:08:46.854 --> 01:08:48.270
making rape jokes
the whole night,

01:08:48.270 --> 01:08:49.609
and no one's saying anything.

01:08:49.609 --> 01:08:50.770
No one's saying anything.

01:08:50.770 --> 01:08:51.399
And I'm sitting there.

01:08:51.399 --> 01:08:53.732
And I'm like-- and the women
are all making eye contact,

01:08:53.732 --> 01:08:57.685
and no one is saying anything.

01:08:57.685 --> 01:09:00.490
And it's just-- it's everywhere.

01:09:00.490 --> 01:09:03.750
And so I think if you give
yourself that seven minutes

01:09:03.750 --> 01:09:06.609
to just acknowledge how
it's touching your life,

01:09:06.609 --> 01:09:07.670
that's the first step.

01:09:07.670 --> 01:09:10.370
And so maybe there's
some sort of little club

01:09:10.370 --> 01:09:13.790
that you guys can start and
do some writing and some

01:09:13.790 --> 01:09:15.220
reflecting.

01:09:15.220 --> 01:09:17.960
ODLEY: Just to add on.

01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:21.590
I guess just, what's really
big is to remind ourselves,

01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:25.930
after 20, it doesn't
mean that life is over.

01:09:25.930 --> 01:09:29.257
And you stop partying and you
just have to find a husband

01:09:29.257 --> 01:09:30.090
and you get married.

01:09:30.090 --> 01:09:32.464
And you won't be called a slut
anymore because you're old

01:09:32.464 --> 01:09:34.410
and all that stuff.

01:09:34.410 --> 01:09:36.979
Stuff like this doesn't
only happen to teenagers.

01:09:36.979 --> 01:09:41.090
It happens to 35-year-olds
with three kids at home.

01:09:41.090 --> 01:09:43.490
They're still being sexually
assaulted in the streets

01:09:43.490 --> 01:09:44.824
or at work.

01:09:44.824 --> 01:09:48.529
And sad to say, older
women are being raped too.

01:09:48.529 --> 01:09:52.620
And we shouldn't have
to be afraid to open

01:09:52.620 --> 01:09:55.622
this conversation and actually
speak up and tell our story.

01:09:55.622 --> 01:09:57.580
And you're not too old
to tell your story if it

01:09:57.580 --> 01:09:59.620
happened a year ago, you know?

01:09:59.620 --> 01:10:03.690
And it's like, life and slut
shaming doesn't end at an age.

01:10:03.690 --> 01:10:05.700
It goes on, and it's wrong.

01:10:05.700 --> 01:10:07.710
And I guess when we
open a conversation,

01:10:07.710 --> 01:10:10.142
we can all say, OK, it's wrong.

01:10:10.142 --> 01:10:11.600
It doesn't happen
to only teenagers

01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:13.880
because they're fragile
and small all that stuff.

01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:15.170
It happens to all of us.

01:10:15.170 --> 01:10:21.220
And it shouldn't be hard to have
the conversation because you're

01:10:21.220 --> 01:10:25.030
older and you have better
things to worry about, you know?

01:10:25.030 --> 01:10:28.469
EMILY MORTIMER: Well, I
am so grateful to have

01:10:28.469 --> 01:10:29.760
been part of this conversation.

01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:30.468
I can't tell you.

01:10:30.468 --> 01:10:32.295
I feel educated.

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:38.370
The beginning of an education
is starting for me, just

01:10:38.370 --> 01:10:40.330
from having been
around these guys

01:10:40.330 --> 01:10:46.070
and being exposed to their
honesty and their willingness

01:10:46.070 --> 01:10:50.920
to talk and be open about these
incredibly important issues.

01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:55.610
And so I'd love to thank you
all so much for coming and Katie

01:10:55.610 --> 01:10:58.940
and Meg for starting
this incredible thing

01:10:58.940 --> 01:11:00.730
and for keeping it going.

01:11:00.730 --> 01:11:05.760
And thank you so much to
Google for hosting us.

01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:08.220
It's an amazing
platform for these guys

01:11:08.220 --> 01:11:09.880
to come and tell their story.

01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:11.960
And thank you for having us.

01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:15.120
And thank you, Feminist Press,
for publishing the book.

01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:20.290
And you guys can pick up the
book-- here, I think, right?

01:11:20.290 --> 01:11:21.490
Get the book.

01:11:21.490 --> 01:11:22.640
The book is awesome.

01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:24.470
I can't stop reading it.

01:11:24.470 --> 01:11:28.690
Every subway ride I'm
on, I'm like this.

01:11:28.690 --> 01:11:29.790
It's really good.

01:11:29.790 --> 01:11:31.720
And my 11-year-old
kid keeps saying,

01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:33.778
Mom, it's so embarrassing,
reading that book.

01:11:33.778 --> 01:11:35.045
Will you please put it away?

01:11:35.045 --> 01:11:38.339
And I'm like, no.

01:11:38.339 --> 01:11:39.880
You should come to
this talk with me.

01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:40.770
KATIE CAPPIELLO:
Yeah, that's right.

01:11:40.770 --> 01:11:42.228
EMILY MORTIMER:
No, I'm not coming.

01:11:42.228 --> 01:11:43.670
DARCI SIEGEL: That's so cute.

01:11:43.670 --> 01:11:46.086
EMILY MORTIMER: Anyway, so
thank you so much for having us

01:11:46.086 --> 01:11:51.200
and for staying long after
you should be home probably.

01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:52.040
Thank you.

01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:53.180
KATIE CAPPIELLO: Thank you.

01:11:53.180 --> 01:11:57.430
[APPLAUSE]
