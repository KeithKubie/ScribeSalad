00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.010
You can never have too
much practice dealing

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:05.160
with the normal distribution,
because it's really

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.470
one of those super
important building

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.320
blocks for the
rest of statistics

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.072
and really a lot of your life.

00:00:11.072 --> 00:00:13.280
So what I've done is I've
taken some sample problems.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.800
This is from ck12.org
Open Source flex book,

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.344
their AP Statistics flex book.

00:00:20.344 --> 00:00:22.760
And I've taken the problems
from their normal distribution

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:23.260
chapter.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.550
So you could go to their
site and actually look up

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.410
these same problems.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.010
So this first problem, which
of the following data sets

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.830
is most likely to be
normally distributed?

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.490
For the other
choices, explain why

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.232
you believe they would not
follow a normal distribution.

00:00:38.232 --> 00:00:38.940
So it's a choice.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.450
So this is my beliefs
come into play.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.550
So this is unusual
in the math context.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.970
It's more of a, what do I think?

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.430
It's kind of an essay question.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:47.840
So let's see what
they have here.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.450
A, the hand span.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.280
Measured from the
tip of the thumb

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.376
to the tip of the
extended fifth finger.

00:00:53.376 --> 00:00:54.750
So I think they're
talking about,

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.160
let me see if I can draw a hand.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.407
So that's the index finger.

00:00:59.407 --> 00:01:00.865
And then you got
the middle finger.

00:01:00.865 --> 00:01:02.510
And then you got
your ring finger.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.190
And you got your pinky.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.080
And the hand will look
something like that.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.913
I think they're talking
about this distance.

00:01:07.913 --> 00:01:09.620
From the tip of the
thumb to the tip

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.470
of the extended
fifth finger, which

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.220
is a fancy way of saying
the pinky, I think.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.220
They're talking about
that distance right there.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.060
And they're saying, if
I were to measure it

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.910
of a random sample of
high school seniors,

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.240
what would it look like?

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.170
Well, you know how far this is.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.250
This is a combination
of genetics

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.610
and environmental factors,
maybe how much milk you drank

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.010
or how much you hung from
your pinky from a bar

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.540
while you were growing up.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.720
So I would think
that it is a sum

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.980
of a huge number of
random processes.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.900
So I would guess that it is
roughly, normally distributed.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.240
You know, if I look at my own
hand, and my hand I don't think

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.920
has grown much since I
was a high school senior.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.920
It looks like roughly
nine inches or so.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:50.570
I play guitar.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.090
Maybe that helped
me stretch my hand.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.960
But it's really
an essay question,

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.477
so I just have to
say what I feel.

00:01:57.477 --> 00:01:59.060
So I would guess
that the distribution

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.160
would look something like this.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.590
I don't know.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:01.464
I've never done this.

00:02:01.464 --> 00:02:06.450
But maybe it has a mean of
eight inches or nine inches

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.530
and is distributed
something like this.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.820
It's distributed
something like that.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.590
So maybe it probably does look
like a normal distribution.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.600
But probably won't be
a perfect, in fact, I

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.600
can guarantee you it won't be
a perfect normal distribution.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.850
Because one, no one can have
negative length of that span.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.490
This distance could
never be negative.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.030
So they're going
to have, I guess

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.164
you could have no hand so that
would maybe be counted as 0.

00:02:33.164 --> 00:02:35.580
But the distribution wouldn't
go into the negative domain.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.464
So it wouldn't be a
perfect normal distribution

00:02:39.464 --> 00:02:40.380
on the left hand side.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.262
It would really
just end here at 0.

00:02:42.262 --> 00:02:43.845
And even on the right
hand side, there

00:02:43.845 --> 00:02:46.540
is some physically
impossible hand lengths.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.690
No one can have a
hand that's larger

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.550
than the height
of the atmosphere

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.220
or an astronomical unit.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.540
You would you start
touching the sun.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.020
There's some point, which
is physically impossible

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.760
to get to.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.800
And in a true
normal distribution,

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.310
if I were to flip
a bunch of coins

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.900
there's some very,
very small probability

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.400
that I could get a
million heads in a row.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.150
It's almost 0.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.390
But there's some probability.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.210
But in the case of hand span,
there's no way out here,

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.650
you know, the probability
of human being

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.860
who happens to be a high
school senior, having

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:24.597
a one-mile length
hand span, that's 0.

00:03:24.597 --> 00:03:26.805
So it's not going to be a
perfect normal distribution

00:03:26.805 --> 00:03:29.590
of the outliers or as we
get further and further away

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:30.480
from the mean.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.610
But I think it'll be a pretty
good, in our everyday world as

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.360
good as we're going
to get, approximation.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.943
The normal distribution
is going to be

00:03:36.943 --> 00:03:39.745
a pretty good approximation for
the distribution that we see.

00:03:39.745 --> 00:03:42.380
And I guess one thing that
you know-- It's funny.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.940
This is high school
seniors, when I did this,

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.210
it was kind of from my
point of view as a guy.

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.650
And I would argue that high
school seniors, guys, probably

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.070
have larger hands than women.

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.974
So it's possible you actually
have a bimodal distribution.

00:03:54.974 --> 00:03:56.390
So instead of
having it like this,

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.250
it's possible that the
distribution looks like this.

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.610
That you have one peak for
guys, maybe at eight inches.

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.330
And then maybe a peak for
women at seven inches.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.060
And then the distribution
falls off like that.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.820
So it's also possible
it could be bimodal.

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.170
But in general, a
normal distribution

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.459
is going to be a pretty
good approximation

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.300
for part A of this problem.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:22.740
Let's see what part B, what
they're asking us to describe.

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.150
The annual salaries
of all employees

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.650
of a large shipping company.

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.430
So if we're talking
about annual salaries,

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.380
we have minimum
wage laws whatnot.

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.338
so I would guess that
any corporation, if we're

00:04:34.338 --> 00:04:36.100
talking about full
time workers at least,

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.277
there's going to be some
minimum salary that people have.

00:04:39.277 --> 00:04:41.110
So I would say, and
probably a lot of people

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:42.901
will have that minimum
salary because it'll

00:04:42.901 --> 00:04:45.660
be probably the most
labor intensive jobs,

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.850
you probably have
most people down there

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.400
at the low end of the scale.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.460
And then you have your
different middle level managers

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:53.520
and whatnot.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.040
And then you probably
have this big gap.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.700
And then you probably have
your true executives, maybe

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.120
your CEO or whatnot.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:08.130
If this mean, right here,
is maybe $40,000 a year

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.240
and this is probably
$80,000 where

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.020
some of the mid-level
managers lie.

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.397
But this out here, this
will probably be-- Actually

00:05:15.397 --> 00:05:17.980
if you were to draw it real, the
way I've scaled it right now,

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.240
this would be about
$200,00, which is actually

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.882
a reasonable salary for a CEO.

00:05:23.882 --> 00:05:25.590
But the reality is,
is that this actually

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.660
might get pushed
way out from there.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.310
It might look
something like that.

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.280
It might be way off the chart.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.922
Let's say the CEO made
$5 million in a year

00:05:33.922 --> 00:05:36.130
because he cashed in a bunch
of options or something.

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:37.220
So it would be way over here.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:38.594
And maybe it's a
CEO and a couple

00:05:38.594 --> 00:05:41.740
of other people, the
CFO or the founders.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.480
So my guess is it
definitely wouldn't

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.810
be a normal distribution.

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:49.665
And it would be bimodal.

00:05:49.665 --> 00:05:52.165
You would have another peak
over here for senior management.

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:57.560
Well, if we were
maybe in Europe,

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.080
this would be
closer to the left.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.020
But it won't be a perfect
normal distribution.

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.180
And you're not going
to have any values

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.170
below a certain threshold,
below that kind of minimum wage

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:07.670
level.

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:09.130
So I would call
this, when you have

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.340
a tail that goes
more to the right

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.030
than to the left, a right
skewed distribution.

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.340
Since it has two humps right
here, one there, and one there.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.585
We can also says it bimodal.

00:06:23.585 --> 00:06:25.710
I mean, it depends on what
kind of company this is.

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:29.990
But that would be my guess of a
lot of large shipping company's

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:31.060
salaries.

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:35.150
Let's look at choice
C or problem part C.

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:37.570
The annual salaries
of a random sample

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:42.420
of 50 CEOs of major companies,
25 women and 25 men.

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:43.930
The fact that they
wrote this year,

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.540
I think they maybe are
implying that maybe men

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:50.230
and women, the gender gap
has not been closed fully,

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:52.730
and there is some discrepancy.

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:57.050
So if I was just purely 50
CEOs of major companies,

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.600
I would say it's probably
close to a normal distribution.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.940
It's probably something
like, once again, there's

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:06.946
going to be some level below
which no CEO is willing to work

00:07:06.946 --> 00:07:08.695
for, although you have
heard of some cases

00:07:08.695 --> 00:07:09.580
where they work for free.

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:11.400
But they're really getting
paid in other ways.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.858
If you include all
of those things,

00:07:12.858 --> 00:07:14.600
there's probably
some base salary

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.090
that all CEOs make
at least that much.

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:21.640
And then it goes up to some
value, the highest probability

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:22.140
value.

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:24.460
And then it probably has
a long tail to the right.

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.370
And this is if there
were no gender gap.

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:28.910
So this would just be a purely
right skewed distribution

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:30.721
where you have a long
tail to the right.

00:07:30.721 --> 00:07:32.720
Now, if you assume that
there's some gender gap,

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.830
then you might have
two humps here,

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:36.480
which would be a
bimodal distribution.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.500
So if you assume
there's some gender gap,

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.990
this is part C right
here, then maybe there's

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:42.180
one hump for women.

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:44.180
And if you assume that
women earn less than men,

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:45.530
then another hump for men.

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:47.540
And there are 25 of
each so there wouldn't

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.450
necessarily more men than women.

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:51.617
And then it would skew all
the way off to the right.

00:07:51.617 --> 00:07:53.741
And in fact, I think there
would probably be chance

00:07:53.741 --> 00:07:55.890
that you have this other
notion here where you have

00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:59.790
these super CEOs, or mega
CEOs who make millions,

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:02.484
while most CEOs
probably just make,

00:08:02.484 --> 00:08:04.775
I'll put it in quotation
marks, "a few hundred thousand

00:08:04.775 --> 00:08:07.325
dollars" while there's
a small subset that

00:08:07.325 --> 00:08:10.060
are way off many standard
deviations to the right.

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:13.580
So it could even be a
trimodal distribution here.

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:16.450
So that's choice C. And
then so far, choice A

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:18.490
looks like the best
candidate for a pure,

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:21.210
or the closest to being
a normal distribution.

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:23.290
Let's see what D is.

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:26.640
The date of 100 pennies
taken from a cash drawer

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.200
in a convenience store.

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.130
100 pennies.

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:31.470
So that's actually an
interesting experiment.

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:33.500
But I would guess,
and once again, this

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.470
is really a question
where I get to express

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:38.239
my feelings about these things.

00:08:38.239 --> 00:08:39.780
As long as your
answer is reasonable,

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:41.859
I would say that it is right.

00:08:41.859 --> 00:08:43.150
Most pennies are newer pennies.

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:44.120
Because they go
out of commission.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:44.953
They get traded out.

00:08:44.953 --> 00:08:46.430
They get worn out as they age.

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:50.844
They get lost, or they get
pressed at the little tourist

00:08:50.844 --> 00:08:52.510
place into those
little souvenir things.

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:53.926
I'm not even sure
if that's legal,

00:08:53.926 --> 00:08:55.830
if you could do that
the money legally.

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:59.820
So my guess is that if
you were to plot it,

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:01.320
you would have a
ton of pennies that

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:06.640
are, within the last few years,
So the date of 100 pennies, not

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:10.550
their age, so the dates,
so if this is 2010,

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:12.050
I would guess that
right now, you're

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:14.020
not going to find
any 2010 pennies.

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:18.780
But you're probably going to
find a ton of 2009 pennies.

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:22.030
And then it probably just
goes down from there.

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:24.010
And of course, you're
not going to find pennies

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:26.765
that are older than
the United States

00:09:26.765 --> 00:09:28.640
or before they even
started printing pennies.

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:30.420
So it's obvious this tail
isn't going to go to the left

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:31.330
forever.

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:33.200
But my guess is
you're going to have

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.645
a left skewed distribution.

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:41.710
Where you have the bulk of
the distribution on the right,

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:43.550
but the tail goes
off to the left.

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:45.633
That's why it's called a
left skewed distribution.

00:09:45.633 --> 00:09:51.950
Sometimes this is called a
negatively skewed distribution.

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:55.040
And similarly, this right skewed
distribution, or this right you

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:58.060
distribution, sometimes is
called positively skewed.

00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:59.950
And if you have only one hump.

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:03.100
You don't have a multimodal
distribution like this,

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:05.610
in a left skewed
distribution, your mean

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:08.334
is going to be to the
left of your median.

00:10:08.334 --> 00:10:09.750
So in this case,
maybe your median

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:11.090
might be someplace over here.

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:13.770
But since you have this
long tail to the left,

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:16.790
your mean might be
someplace over here.

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:18.410
And likewise, in
this distribution,

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:22.006
your median, your middle value,
might be some place like this.

00:10:22.006 --> 00:10:24.380
But because it's right skewed,
and for the most part only

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:25.710
has one big hump.

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:28.147
this hump won't change things
too much because it's small,

00:10:28.147 --> 00:10:29.980
your mean is going to
be to the right of it.

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:31.355
So that's another
reason why it's

00:10:31.355 --> 00:10:35.290
called a right skewed or
positively skewed distribution.

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:37.300
So to answer the
question, you know,

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:38.970
these are my feelings
about all of them.

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:40.762
But I would say--
the other choices

00:10:40.762 --> 00:10:42.720
explain why you believe
they would not follow--

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.636
or they said, which of
the following data sets

00:10:44.636 --> 00:10:47.070
is most likely to be
normally distributed.

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:49.890
Well, I would say choice
A. But it's really

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:52.880
a matter of opinion, at
least in this question.
