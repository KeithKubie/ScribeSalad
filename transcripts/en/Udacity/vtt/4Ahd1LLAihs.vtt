There are many ways to move a camera through a scene. We can walk or fly. We

00:00:03.924 --> 00:00:07.594
can look one direction while moving another and so on. Here we're moving a bit

00:00:07.594 --> 00:00:11.378
sideways and a bit forward while looking forward. I usually think of the camera

00:00:11.378 --> 00:00:15.872
as being in one of two modes, viewer-centric or model-centric. When things are

00:00:15.872 --> 00:00:18.914
viewer-centric the viewer is moving around through the world. When

00:00:18.914 --> 00:00:21.620
model-centric, a particular object in a world is being studied and the viewers

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.270
goal is to see this object from different angles. In this mode we keep the

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.290
camera focused on a location as we move. The place where we look is called the

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.532
Target in 3JS. And in other systems. Note that this Target location is not at

00:00:33.532 --> 00:00:37.294
all necessary in making the various matrices need for viewing the scene. The

00:00:37.294 --> 00:00:41.635
target is much more related to user intent. Because the target is such a useful

00:00:41.635 --> 00:00:44.605
concept, many, but not all, camera control systems support the idea of a target

00:00:44.605 --> 00:00:49.980
in some way. To set the target we use the camera control's target parameter.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.242
We've set this parameter before. It provides the point that our camera is

00:00:53.242 --> 00:00:56.625
looking at, so setting the view matrix. By setting the target in the camera

00:00:56.625 --> 00:00:59.460
controls, you not only set the camera's view transform, you keep the camera

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.132
pointed at this location when you orbit. If the object is moving, you can

00:01:04.132 --> 00:01:07.359
update the target each frame, and the camera will stay trained on it.
