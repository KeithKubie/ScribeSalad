00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.850
Before we do some exercises,
I want you go back to x code and

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:05.200
open up the Maze project.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.790
Once you have it open, I want you
to navigate to the Move.swift file.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:17.490
It's located under Maze &gt; Under The Hood
&gt; Maze Moves &gt; Move.swift.

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.220
This is where we describe the move
struct, but it's just a single file and

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.490
that seems a little confusing.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.080
Since the robot is
moving more than once,

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.490
don't we need more than one move struct
or more than one Move.swift file?

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.360
The answer is no.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.030
Think back to the analogies we
used like engine blue prints.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.560
And the blue prints of a particular
component was defined only once.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.270
But actual instances of the component
will physically exist in tens and

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.110
thousands of actual engines.

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.900
And that's what this file is.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.330
It's like the blue print for
the move struct.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.431
We create this single blueprint as we
can see here, in the Move.swift file,

00:00:55.431 --> 00:01:00.230
and than we can create man instances
of the new struct in our application.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.920
In programming lingo,
we'd call this blueprint a definition.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.390
Or we would say that in the Move.swift
file, we define the move struct.
