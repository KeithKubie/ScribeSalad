00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:05.310
 Every day the world consumes 300 tons of coffee - this amount is enough to give one cup 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.140
 For every man, woman and child 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.970
 The world's largest buyer of coffee, the United States has to import almost all this quantity because 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:13.990
 Caffeine-growing coffee trees grow only commercially 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.110
 Cancer orbit and Capricorn orbit in an area called the coffee belt. Only exist 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.609
 One American state within this belt is Hawaii 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.449
 However, the United States is the largest buyer because the population is very huge. Most countries 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.529
 For coffee drinkers per capita are, in ascending order, the Netherlands, Denmark, Iceland 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.570
 Norway, and Finland champion where they drink three times the coffee 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.199
 Which the average American drinks daily. All these countries are outside the coffee strap 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:38.210
 And to import 100% of its caffeine supply 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.210
 To get this caffeine, the bees must first correct the flowers of the coffee tree and these flowers 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.289
 Grow into bright red berries. Unlike more co-plants, the coffee tree 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.219
 Not all berries ripen at the same time so they need to be picked up 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:50.409
 Manually detachable 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:53.679
 When you pick up, the coffee bean is removed from the berries. Then it is dried 

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:57.229
 Heat, grind and drown these plants in hot water to get 

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:01.139
 The wonderful kaffin. Requires 40 cups of coffee to get one cup of espresso 

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:05.129
 But why caffeine in coffee beans in the first place? Sure, the coffee trees 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.229
 You do not want people to cut off parts of them and commit a holocaust 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:09.310
 Their offspring 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.310
 Of course these trees, do not want or feel anything and caffeine evolved in the original 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.659
 For their own benefit. Caffeine is an insecticide that effectively paralyzes or kills insects that bite 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:18.619
 the tree 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:23.509
 It is not known if these insects feel the largest caffeine 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.759
 Caffeine is a killer but adaptive to insects weighing one gram and not for monkeys weighing 100,00 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:30.770
 Times are bigger than that. So you have to try to win the Darwin Award 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.289
 But, if you want to know: calculate the dose of caffeine you need to drink in order to have a fifty percent chance 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:39.820
 To die, multiply your weight by 150 mg 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.530
 Or in terms of coffee, for every kilogram you need to drink one latte 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.060
 For a visit from the King of Death 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.479
 This is a lot of coffee and therefore it is expected that there will be no fatalities 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.289
 They are healthy from this method and it is questionable if possible. Because while 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:56.509
 You are busy consuming coffee, your body is busy pulling it out somehow 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.969
 Rare deaths from caffeine are people who consumed a lot of diet pills or contraception and crazy people 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.530
 Who consume coffee in its pure form 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.810
 Although caffeine is not a strong name, you can add to it. It is addictive 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.729
 The real physiologist is not a rude addiction like addiction to video games 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:10.470
 And the Internet 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.530
 But caffeine is not heroin - the sudden boycott will not kill you - but it may make you cranky 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.930
 It gives you a painful headache but because caffeine generates dopamine that makes you happy 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.220
 And get rid of headaches There is no convincing reason to quit the abuse 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.629
 And who might want to take off anyway? I mean non-converts to Mormonism (hardcore as Wahhabi) and 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:28.890
 Rastafarianism. Caffeine is the world's most commonly used drug - and for good reason 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.310
 It's very cool 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.360
 It increases concentration, reduces fatigue and gives you better memory 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.420
 This is not a placebo - these results can be returned to the laboratory 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.439
 Contrary to popular belief, coffee drink is not a losing deal though 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:45.180
 Satan gives you the ability to work quickly but in turn makes your life shorter 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.790
 For normal, healthy people there are no medical concerns. May give you coffee and caffeine inside 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.549
 Medical benefits such as protection against cardiovascular disease and diabetes 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:53.870
 Parkinson 's disease 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.840
 Caffeine can get rid of migraines, but the amount is required and the way 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.180
 Absorption .. uncomfortable 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.220
 We follow 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.730
 Do you know what you can thank caffeine for its existence? A small thing called the Age of Enlightenment 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.390
 In the 1600s people drank beer and jin (alcoholic drink) more than they drank water. But with the advent of coffee 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.980
 And tea, people changed from a drink gives you depression to a tonic drink. So it is natural that it is in 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.810
 At that time, a great intellectual civilization was born as compared to previous centuries 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.510
 Ben Franklin and Edward Lloyd loved the coffee for the same reason as the workers 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.010
 And today's students to love coffee. It is invaluable because of its ability to make you awake and focused on work when you need to quit 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.730
 Report what or to remain focused in the boring physics class 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.310
 Coffee is the fuel of the modern world, so I drink a cup of coffee (no guilt) to give you the motivation to work smartly 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.939
 And quickly
