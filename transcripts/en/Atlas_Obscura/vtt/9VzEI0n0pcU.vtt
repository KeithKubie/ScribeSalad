00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.930
- Sunshine Laundromat is a small

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:04.850
laundromat in Brooklyn

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.040
that as you pass through it you realize

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.080
has a little more than meets the eye.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.270
Because in the very back
is a secret door which

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.360
opens onto a bar filled
with some of the greatest

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.500
pinball ever assembled into one location.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.670
We're Atlas Obscura and these are

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.460
infrequently asked
questions with Peter Rose

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.483
the owner of Sunshine Laundromat.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.850
- What is the weirdest
thing you've found in a

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.040
laundry machine?

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.710
I've only found day to day
objects in laundry machines

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.170
but actually in one of the drop off orders

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.187
one of our attendants once found (bleep).

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:41.793
Used (bleep).

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.350
I'm Peter, owner of Sunshine Laundromat

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.240
in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, and today we'll be

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.390
answering some questions
for Atlas Obscura.

00:00:57.965 --> 00:00:59.990
Are drunk people better
at pinball or laundry?

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:01.953
I would say likely pinball.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.390
Drunk people doing laundry,
I think they're just

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.070
making their clothes wet, taking them out

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.430
and shoving them in a bag.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.513
Pinball's probably the
best place for drunks.

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:16.870
If you could have a third hidden business

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.900
behind the bar, what would it be?

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.870
My ideal would be if
we could have something

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.980
that involved more dogs.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.540
A business with large dogs.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.853
A kennel, a litter of puppies back there.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.010
Does your liquor license
cover the laundromat?

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.320
Our license does cover the laundromat.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.400
It's somewhat by choice
and largely by confusion.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.730
The community board, our attorneys

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.750
and even the state
liquor authority I think

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.370
were just so confused by this whole thing

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.333
that they just said, yes.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.900
Where can patrons stand if
they want to simultaneously

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.493
enjoy the aroma of the laundromat and bar?

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.063
Ooh, in the bathroom?

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.590
The middle ground?

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.070
How do you curate the items
in your vending machine?

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.700
Many of the items in the vending machine

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.700
are just random articles
that I'll see in a store

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.493
that would physically
fit in a vending machine.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.920
But one would not expect to find in there.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.260
Selling a dollar for two
dollars I think was just,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.200
really just an attempt at humor.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.450
And it's highly profitable.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.910
It's our best margin item here.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.870
But much to my surprise,
people started buying it

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.180
on a near daily basis.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.623
And we had one person that came in here,

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.280
bought it and he thought
there was a hidden gift

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.630
behind it, presumably something worth

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:49.930
thousands of dollars.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.820
So he was a little
disappointed when he found out

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.613
he got a dollar for two dollars.

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.140
Has there ever been a combo
laundry and pinball machine?

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.240
Who wrote this question?

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.150
You're a genius.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.563
This is amazing, we're gonna talk.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.540
Who wouldn't wanna play a
laundry pinball machine?

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.343
Quick, add the bleach, softener.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.130
Netflix just approached you about making

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.610
a pinball and/or laundry themed series.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.140
What's the title of the
show and what is it about?

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.133
Title of the show, Sunshine Laundromat.

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.210
It would probably have to be about dogs.

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.490
Oh, we have subliminal dogs everywhere.

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:32.573
Hidden dogs, it's a treasure hunt.

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:35.160
Just nothing in the bar area.

00:03:37.364 --> 00:03:39.590
Department of Health doesn't like that.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.670
If you could be buried
inside a pinball machine

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.393
which one would you choose?

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.660
Oh, wow, all-time favorite
could be Medieval Madness.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.840
So I might have to spend the
rest of my life inside there.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.500
As great as many of the other games are,

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.170
that's one that I could
come back to endlessly.

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.040
Does this place have a lost and found?

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.810
If so, what's the
weirdest thing that's ever

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:05.860
been in there?

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.230
We do have a lost and found.

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.920
It's in one of our broken old dryers

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.963
that somebody set ablaze.

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.980
The weirdest thing that's
ever been in there,

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.170
I think for a while it may
have been a nativity scene.

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.830
Although I'm not sure that was lost.

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.143
That might have been a
little more deliberate.

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.360
What's the most money
you've ever physically held

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.363
in quarters?

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.220
I would say the most I've
ever lugged over to the bank

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.590
in one trip is probably about $5,000.

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.343
At which point I needed
to visit a chiropractor.

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.440
What questions haven't
we asked that we should?

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.640
That might be how did we
know we were successful

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.980
beyond looking at finances?

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.460
I think one of my favorite
instances was when

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.650
we received a certified
letter from the state

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.090
liquor authority offering
their condolences

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.433
about the place not existing.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.450
Meanwhile they just couldn't find us.

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.580
Which was so flattering that the whole

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.330
speakeasy concept actually worked.

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.000
In what ways is pinball
a metaphor for life?

00:05:28.898 --> 00:05:31.181
Gotta come back to that.
