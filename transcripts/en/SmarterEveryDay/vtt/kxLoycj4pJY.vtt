Hey it's me, Destin

00:00:01.342 --> 00:00:02.560
welcome back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.100
Not really sure how this is gonna work out

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.495
but I want to know a little bit more about tattoos.

00:00:07.495 --> 00:00:09.824
So I'm just walking up to a tattoo parlour

00:00:09.824 --> 00:00:13.084
and seeing if they will let me video a tattoo

00:00:13.084 --> 00:00:15.753
being applied in slow motion with a Phantom.

00:00:15.753 --> 00:00:17.446
Let's see how this works.

00:00:17.776 --> 00:00:20.435
[tattoo machine buzz]

00:00:20.658 --> 00:00:21.969
OK we're in the shop,

00:00:21.969 --> 00:00:23.321
this is.. Leah? Right?

00:00:23.321 --> 00:00:23.828
- Mm hmm. Hi.

00:00:23.828 --> 00:00:25.926
- OK this is Leah and she's an artist.

00:00:25.926 --> 00:00:27.181
We're not supposed to say..

00:00:27.181 --> 00:00:28.244
What, is that what we call you?

00:00:28.244 --> 00:00:30.318
- A tattoo artist, tattooer, tattooist,

00:00:30.318 --> 00:00:31.799
in England they use tattooist.

00:00:31.799 --> 00:00:33.846
- Excellent. OK so, can you teach us how to

00:00:33.846 --> 00:00:36.015
tattoo somebody with.. I guess this is the gun right?

00:00:36.015 --> 00:00:38.030
- Well machine, we don't call it a gun,

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.882
that's a no no.

00:00:38.882 --> 00:00:39.795
- So what do we have here?

00:00:39.795 --> 00:00:41.428
- This is a rotary machine.

00:00:41.428 --> 00:00:43.941
There are a few different types of tattoo machines

00:00:43.941 --> 00:00:46.212
but the most commonly used is the coil

00:00:46.212 --> 00:00:47.901
and I would say the second most common

00:00:47.901 --> 00:00:49.129
is the rotary machine.

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:50.634
- Oh really. Can you show us how it works?

00:00:50.634 --> 00:00:52.770
- Sure. This itself is the motor.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:53.374
- Ahuh.

00:00:53.374 --> 00:00:56.500
- The head of the needle, actually the needle bar

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.356
connects here, and it goes through a tube,

00:00:59.356 --> 00:01:00.803
which this is.

00:01:00.803 --> 00:01:01.869
- Is that what you hold?

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:03.846
- We hold this. This is technically the grip.

00:01:03.846 --> 00:01:05.319
I'm gonna put on gloves.

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:07.281
Not because I really need to in this case

00:01:07.281 --> 00:01:09.097
because I'm not tattooing anyone

00:01:09.097 --> 00:01:11.543
and all of this is sterile, but it's habit.

00:01:11.543 --> 00:01:14.773
It feels strange to open a bag without gloves on.

00:01:14.773 --> 00:01:15.431
- Oh really?

00:01:15.431 --> 00:01:16.246
- So I'm just gonna do it.

00:01:16.246 --> 00:01:17.441
- So it's kind of an important thing?

00:01:17.441 --> 00:01:18.098
- Yeah.

00:01:18.098 --> 00:01:20.014
(Destin) I used to think that a tattoo machine came to a single

00:01:20.014 --> 00:01:22.561
needle point and it injected ink under the skin.

00:01:22.561 --> 00:01:25.015
It's actually multiple needles and they're grouped

00:01:25.015 --> 00:01:26.965
together for lining, however for shading it's

00:01:26.965 --> 00:01:29.571
more like a paintbrush. Ink is held in between

00:01:29.571 --> 00:01:32.111
those multiple needle points using capillary action

00:01:32.111 --> 00:01:34.587
and when it punctures the skin it drags the ink

00:01:34.587 --> 00:01:36.121
down into the dermis.

00:01:37.511 --> 00:01:38.232
- Tada!

00:01:38.232 --> 00:01:40.315
- Gotcha. So you've got.. Now you have a needle

00:01:40.315 --> 00:01:43.938
in a tube attached to a machine, and you're

00:01:43.938 --> 00:01:45.229
ready to make that machine work.

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.051
So what do you do? Power I'm guessing?

00:01:47.051 --> 00:01:48.211
- Power.

00:01:48.211 --> 00:01:50.345
- Rotary machines are pretty easy to understand.

00:01:50.345 --> 00:01:53.749
Here this motor has rotational motion, and it's

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:56.739
translated to linear motion here at the needle bar.

00:01:56.739 --> 00:01:58.097
That's pretty simple right?

00:01:58.097 --> 00:02:01.576
Coil machines however are a bit more complicated.

00:02:01.576 --> 00:02:04.473
When Leah steps on this foot pedal, that direct

00:02:04.473 --> 00:02:06.838
current is applied to the two coils.

00:02:06.838 --> 00:02:09.883
This turns those coils into an electromagnet

00:02:09.883 --> 00:02:11.919
and it pulls this armature bar down,

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:13.843
moving the needle. When the armature bar

00:02:13.843 --> 00:02:16.538
moves down, it breaks the circuit away from the

00:02:16.538 --> 00:02:19.177
contact screw and that causes the electromagnetic

00:02:19.177 --> 00:02:22.317
field to collapse. The spring then returns the

00:02:22.317 --> 00:02:24.515
armature and it reenergizes the circuit.

00:02:24.985 --> 00:02:27.496
This just happens over and over again

00:02:27.496 --> 00:02:30.346
and that's it. That's how a coil machine works.

00:02:30.346 --> 00:02:31.878
One word of caution though.

00:02:31.878 --> 00:02:33.610
Just because you understand how a coil

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.676
machine works, doesn't mean you know how

00:02:35.676 --> 00:02:37.004
to use it.

00:02:37.004 --> 00:02:38.879
Did you really tattoo yourself?

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.603
You did it? Let me see.

00:02:41.603 --> 00:02:42.453
- Yeah it's ridiculous.

00:02:42.453 --> 00:02:43.099
- Oh that's..

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:44.556
- That's what happens.

00:02:45.216 --> 00:02:46.411
- So it's a bad idea?

00:02:46.411 --> 00:02:47.540
- It's a very bad idea.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.200
- What's your name?

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.831
- Shawn.

00:02:48.831 --> 00:02:50.677
- Shawn says do not tattoo yourself.

00:02:50.677 --> 00:02:52.560
Go to a professional like Leah right.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.569
- Yes.

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:56.614
(Destin) OK now that we know how the machines work

00:02:56.614 --> 00:02:58.210
it's time to investigate what the needles

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:59.717
are doing to the skin.

00:02:59.717 --> 00:03:02.446
I brought special lights and a special macro lens

00:03:02.446 --> 00:03:05.268
so we can record it at first 1500 frames per second

00:03:05.268 --> 00:03:08.288
and then ramp it up to 3200 frames per second.

00:03:08.288 --> 00:03:11.193
This is why tattoos hurt.

00:03:11.193 --> 00:03:14.499
[music]

00:04:14.118 --> 00:04:17.483
OK I have decided that I want to feel what this

00:04:17.483 --> 00:04:19.868
needle feels like because it's actually going

00:04:19.868 --> 00:04:22.003
in the skin and pulling it up and you said you can

00:04:22.003 --> 00:04:23.629
do this without actually tattooing me.

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:24.819
- Yeah I'm not gonna use..

00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:26.832
I'm just gonna use a needle.

00:04:26.832 --> 00:04:28.177
- I'm a little nervous.

00:04:28.177 --> 00:04:29.276
I want to know what it feels like,

00:04:29.276 --> 00:04:30.469
but I don't want a tattoo.

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:31.787
This is the next best thing right?

00:04:31.787 --> 00:04:32.752
- Yeah exactly.

00:04:32.752 --> 00:04:33.517
- OK, deep breath in.

00:04:33.517 --> 00:04:35.087
- Deep breath in, breathe it out slowly.

00:04:35.087 --> 00:04:37.689
[tattoo machine buzz]

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:39.164
- Whewhoo. That wasn't bad.

00:04:39.164 --> 00:04:39.765
- OK.

00:04:39.765 --> 00:04:40.642
- OK I can handle that.

00:04:40.642 --> 00:04:41.207
- That was it.

00:04:41.207 --> 00:04:42.118
- OK what did you do?

00:04:42.118 --> 00:04:42.931
- See there?

00:04:44.051 --> 00:04:47.105
- Oh. I can see why people get addicted to that.

00:04:47.805 --> 00:04:50.393
Because it's like a.. it's like fear.

00:04:50.393 --> 00:04:50.898
- Yeah.

00:04:50.898 --> 00:04:52.306
- So this was the line needle and this was

00:04:52.306 --> 00:04:52.777
the shading needle.

00:04:52.777 --> 00:04:53.277
- Correct.

00:04:53.473 --> 00:04:54.980
- And how many needles were on the line needle?

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:55.637
- Five.

00:04:55.637 --> 00:04:56.482
- And how many were on the shading needle?

00:04:56.482 --> 00:04:57.271
- Seven.

00:04:57.271 --> 00:04:59.053
- There you go. Smarter Every Day.

00:04:59.053 --> 00:05:01.439
- On the front of your forearm I think it hurts more than the back.

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:02.319
- You think I could take it?

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:03.540
- Of course you could.

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.658

She has a really cool Instagram account.

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:45.216
- You see what I mean about the frosting right?

00:05:47.586 --> 00:05:48.734
(Destin) I do.

00:05:48.734 --> 00:05:50.276
- How it elevates the top layer of skin there.

00:05:51.856 --> 00:05:52.782
- OK, so when you..

00:05:52.782 --> 00:05:54.256

- Yeah I subscribe to it.

00:06:00.062 --> 00:06:02.191
- Oh fantastic. Was this done here?

00:06:02.191 --> 00:06:03.449
- It was. Leah did it.

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:06.525
- Awesome. Crazy.

00:06:06.745 --> 00:06:09.221
Did I just get cred because that guy knew who I was?

00:06:09.221 --> 00:06:09.848
- Yes.

00:06:09.848 --> 00:06:10.762
- OK excellent. [laugh]

00:06:12.112 --> 00:06:13.681
- You're not just some weirdo coming into my shop.

00:06:13.681 --> 00:06:15.342
[laughs]

00:06:15.342 --> 00:06:17.379
(Destin) Alright so this is your famous tattoo?

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:20.239
- I posted on reddit and got a few hits.

00:06:20.859 --> 00:06:22.202
- That's awesome.

00:06:22.202 --> 00:06:23.287

- Yes.

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.576

Have a good one.

00:06:29.152 --> 00:06:30.060
This is fake by the way.

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.786
We're not actually tattooing me. [laugh]

00:06:31.786 --> 00:06:33.952
It was a good fake though.
