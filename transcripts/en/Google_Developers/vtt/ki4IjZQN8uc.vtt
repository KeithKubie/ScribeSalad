&gt;&gt;Presenter (Don Dodge): Thank you everyone
for coming. We have an all star panel of Venture

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.699
capitalists, the best in the business, hand
picked, they're all my friends. [laughter]

00:00:09.699 --> 00:00:10.799
So I'm proud to say they're all my friends,
I’ve worked with them for many, many years.

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:18.050
So when Google said let’s do a panel, a
VC panel, I said I'm there, and we can bring

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:25.530
the right people here. Before we get started,
I've got a couple of questions for you. And

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:33.340
one announcement. Tonight there will be a
reception hosted by Google ventures. Ah, Joe

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.550
Kraus, is one of the partners, right here.
[clapping]. And David Crane over here from

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.380
Google Ventures. Ah you need a ticket like
this to get in. So if you want to come to

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:52.360
the Google Ventures reception see David Crane
or Joe Kraus or myself and we'll get you a

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.510
ticket to get in. Um, let me start with a
couple of questions. How many of you are from

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.570
Startups? Raise your hand. Alright, that warms
my heart.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.000
Audience: [Google does not count as a startup]

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:11.530
&gt;&gt;Don: That's true. That's true. And how many
of you are either seeking funding, or will

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:17.469
soon be ready for your next round? Raise your
hand. OK, so keep your hands up. OK VC's those

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:23.469
are the guys you want to talk to. There's
about a Billion dollars of capital sitting

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:28.890
here. A Billion dollars. So you only want
50 Million, right? So, should be OK, should

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.209
be easy to do. there are Mic's over here in
the audience, so we want you to come up and

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:41.350
ask questions throughout. So I'll be watching
and recognizing you for questions, ok? I'm

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.539
gonna start with a few and then we'll take
your questions. But first let's start with

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:51.419
introductions in case you don't know these
guys. Let's have a minute or two introduction

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:54.560
for each of you. Let's start with Brad.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.399
&gt;&gt;Brad: Brad Feld, I'm managing director of
a Venture firm in Boulder, Colorado called

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:07.249
Foundry Group. We do software Internet investing
all around the U.S. We're four partners, $225

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:12.220
million fund, 20 something companies that
we've invested in.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:18.650
&gt;&gt;Dave: My name is Dave McClure. I paint houses
on the weekend for really low rates, so if

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.490
any of you guys need any work done, just let
me know.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:23.660
[inaudible comment from audience]

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.050
&gt;&gt;Dave: [laughs] Um, I do earlier stage investing
that Brad I think. Probably if you're looking

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:34.150
for $20 checks, I’m your guy. I've done
about 40 or 50 investments over the last couple

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.030
of years with Founders Fund, running their
early stage program and the Facebook incubator

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.440
program last summer.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.780
&gt;&gt;Jeff: [strong French accent] Um, Jeff Clavier,
he moved next to my house and so he's painting

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.050
it. Um, I'm at SoftTech VC which is a $15
million fund that has done 49 investments

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:55.930
in the past 2 years. And before that I did
24 as an Angel so I'm one of the most active

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.580
guys in the work pool space. And I'm thrilled
to be on the panel that doesn't talk about

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.350
the VC investment, but something else. Thank
you though.

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:08.590
&gt;&gt;Matt: Matt Holleran, Emergence Capital.
Emergence is a little different in that our

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.140
whole firm is focused on business applications
and particularly recurring revenue business

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.600
applications. In the Freemium market investments
include Yammer, and EchoSign and YouSendit.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.820
And in the SAS world, ah companies like Salesforce.com
and SuccessFactors.

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:31.121
&gt;&gt;Joe: My name is Joe Kraus. I'm two time
entrepreneur. I started Excite in the early

00:03:31.121 --> 00:03:35.680
'90's and a company called JotSpot about three
and a half years ago which I sold to Google.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:45.090
And I recently joined the dark side. And ah,
of Google Ventures and I think we have 11

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.940
investments thus far, and we're a relatively
young shop, about a little over a year old.

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:57.330
&gt;&gt;Presenter: OK so this a panel about Freemium
and Free trial and revenue models for startups.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.590
So to start maybe we should level set and
just have a brief explanation of Freemium,

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.760
Free trial and maybe open revenue models.
Does anyone wanna take that and just explain

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.610
what we mean by Freemium?

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:17.029
&gt;&gt;Jeff: So I'll give it a try. Um typically
you're gonna have an application with a set

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:23.939
of functionality which you're gonna make available
for free. And then a subset of those features

00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:30.249
will be only available to people who pay a
bit of money because they have reached a point;

00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:36.199
whether it's time, whether it's capacity,
whether it's storage, that you know, has max'd

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:41.431
out the free version. So you will say hey,
if you want to continue using our product,

00:04:41.431 --> 00:04:46.379
or if you want the convenience of additional
features, you can pay us a certain monthly

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:51.130
fee. And typically there is a recurring model
where every month or every quarter whatever,

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.759
someone pays something.

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:58.060
&gt;&gt;Presenter: And what about Free trial? How
would you contrast Freemium to a Free Trial?

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:03.430
&gt;&gt;Joe: I just think the simple thing is the
free trial is typically the fully featured

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.569
product which you're allowed to use for a
limited period of time. And the Freemium model

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:11.120
always has a free component or always has
some functionality that's free and then you

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.080
can pay for additional features or capability
users etc.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:19.830
&gt;&gt;Matt: I guess I'd take a slightly different
approach on it which is, in the business application

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:25.800
world, Freemium is a pretty revolutionary
new business model. And part of how it's different

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:31.800
is that business freemium applications are
bought. And historically business applications

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.279
have been sold and as Joe just described,
a free trial is inherently controlled by a

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:42.120
Sales person. A Freemium application that
you're using, you need permission to sell

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.949
to that end customer.

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:50.319
&gt;&gt;Don: So Freemium is sometimes not recognized
as a significant business model that you can

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:55.699
build a significant company from. But here
are a few examples of companies that I think

00:05:55.699 --> 00:06:01.389
did pretty well. Skype. I think everyone knows
Skype. It's a multi billion dollar company

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:13.360
built on a freemium model. LinkedIn, Flicker,
Pandora, Ancestry, I think that, well Taipan,

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:18.860
DropBox; there's tons of them. The common
thread there, seems to be though that these

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:24.210
are consumer based applications. With millions
and millions of users. And my question is,

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:31.180
can enterprise apps also use Freemium? Can
it work? Do the economics work?

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:35.879
&gt;&gt;Dave: So I guess one thing that I might
point out as an example of that would be Twilio,

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:40.189
which isn't quite free, but the enterprise
version of Freemium is really fuckin' cheap.

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:43.819
Versus big SLA that cost me a lot of money.

00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:47.999
&gt;&gt;Joe: It was only 2 minutes before you swore.
That's a land state record.

00:06:47.999 --> 00:06:51.479
&gt;&gt;Dave: [laughs] It's my modus operandus to
get it out early so people aren't waiting

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:59.759
for it and then we can move on. So Twilio
has a relatively cheap cost structure. However

00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:04.469
I think if you sort of want more enterprise
SLA agreements, then there's definitely more

00:07:04.469 --> 00:07:10.520
you can pay for the product. And I think a
lot of, not necessarily consumer facing products,

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:15.729
but products that are for developer audiences
can be sold at the enterprise at the departmental

00:07:15.729 --> 00:07:21.330
level at a relatively inexpensive cost. Typically
once the kind of corporation or enterprise

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:25.759
wants to start using it in a more regular
fashion or with some level of support, then

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:30.939
there might be an opportunity to sort of step
up to a larger cost structure. Not quite Freemium,

00:07:30.939 --> 00:07:33.129
but maybe you know, Freemium-er.

00:07:33.129 --> 00:07:40.219
&gt;&gt;Joe: Matt probably has the best data I assume,
given that he funds mostly enterprise SAS

00:07:40.219 --> 00:07:47.400
models, but I personally think it's ah, a
little tough in that my data may be a little

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:53.009
bit old, but rule of thumb I always think
about is it's about a 2% [unintelligible]

00:07:53.009 --> 00:07:58.710
conversion for most applications from Free
to Premium. At least that's what I've seen,

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:05.770
and seen in my own experience. The, ah, some
of the Anti-virus guys and some of the registry

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:13.479
cleaners get much higher than that. Upwards
of like, 11 to 15%. But most people aren't

00:08:13.479 --> 00:08:19.379
registry cleaners and most people aren't Anti-virus
companies, so I think one of the tough parts

00:08:19.379 --> 00:08:23.960
to the Freemium model is that when I talk
lots and lots of Freemium companies, the data

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:31.340
all seems to suggest that there's a , about
a 2%, not limit but at most on average, tend

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:34.260
to yield 2% when they're up and running and
humming.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:39.440
&gt;&gt;Jeff: So I think the game for someone who
has a Freemium model in mind is to have a

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:44.980
massive funnel that they can drive people
through and eventually convert this into a

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:48.200
percentage. And that's why it sort of lends
itself naturally to the , the consumer market,

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:53.260
because you can have 10's of millions of users
and if you convert only 2% or 5% it's still

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.130
a lot of users.

00:08:56.130 --> 00:09:04.370
&gt;&gt;Brad: You have some interesting historical
proxies for Freemium in the enterprise, and

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:07.540
the best one to use and then I'll map it to
Google specifically but the best one to use

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:13.800
is SharePoint which essentially has an incredibly
broad footprint in the enterprise, mostly

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:19.161
because for the first handful of years Microsoft
gave it away as part of the ELA agreement,

00:09:19.161 --> 00:09:23.320
so you essentially got it if you bought the
ELA agreement; you got this extra functionality

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:28.300
for free. And then over time if you wanted
to have it broadly licensed there were opportunities

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:34.530
to then buy up the package. It's interesting
if you sort of make the metaphor to things

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:39.230
that cross over between consumer and enterprise,
you know Gmail and Google Apps seems like

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:45.910
a pretty natural example. Um, I can use Gmail
forever for free, and there is a clear opportunity

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:49.860
for me to then pay for Google Apps to start
to have certain things that I can't get if

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:54.410
I just have Gmail. So I think it's a little
subtle in it's difference because we're so

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:58.570
tuned in to the, these people that are building
consumer based products use. So tuned in to

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:05.110
give away a lot to convert 2%, to extra functionality
whether it's specific features or storage

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:10.260
etc. But I think the opposite is true in the
Enterprise which is give away something broadly

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:15.470
and get more distribution, as you build more
value on the product and get more people using

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:20.640
that product, then layer on a paid service.
So really it's the same model but as different

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:21.640
approach.

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:26.260
&gt;&gt;Don: I'd remind you there are microphones
in the audience. Just step up to the microphone

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:27.820
if you'd like to ask a question.

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:31.650
&gt;&gt;Dave: I just want to point out that there
are two or three different reasons why you

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:36.550
would offer something for free. One is because
you want to give the user time to understand

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:39.840
what the product is, and if you charge for
it right away, they may not take that time.

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:44.990
So that’s kind of learning about product
benefit. There's free because that user's

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:49.320
gonna provide distribution benefit and viral
fashion to other users. So I might tolerate

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:54.590
them being free forever as long as they're
inviting other users into the product. And

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:58.470
the third one is maybe close to that, but
you get network benefit by having more people

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:03.150
in. So you may tolerate them being a free-rider
as long as they're adding value in some way.

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:08.320
It may not be by invitation but by participation
of data. So I think understanding of why things,

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:12.230
why we're trying to get users in, and what,
you know what version of that will drive whether

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:15.140
it's free trial, or Freemium or Free forever,
or Free completely.

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:21.290
&gt;&gt;Matt: yeah and I think I guess our results
are, it's working in the business context

00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:28.080
and the scale of the conversions are in the
kind of one to ten percent at limit that we're

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:34.300
starting to see. To Joe's point, you want
these markets to be really big. But two factors

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:39.920
connected to the virility right now are, really
no business application other than Intuit

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:47.610
historically has penetrated the ten employ
and less business. Gmail and Google Apps is

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:55.520
changing that. And the VSB market is many,
many tens of millions in the U.S and North

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:59.960
America. And these today out of the shoot,
these, the freemium business applications

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:06.350
companies are serving the globe. And so what
might not have been markets that worked in

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:10.760
a SAS context five years ago and certainly
didn't in a SAP Oracle context are now at

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:15.390
scale where that can work. And then to the
point on the difference between consumer and

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:18.950
business is I might love this thing and it's
a great service but now there's five people

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:23.410
or ten people like Chuck at SlideRock who
I just mentioned in the previous session,

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:27.740
you know, he gets now 5 or 10 people from
Google Apps off the market place that see

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:31.790
the solution versus one. And you can start
to seed applications and then sell them a

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:35.760
more expensive product later, that change
the economics pretty significantly in the

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:41.230
business. I guess the model is really going
after new segments and new opportunities today

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:45.390
that are of scale, that can really make the
economics work and it's really exciting.

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:47.650
&gt;&gt;Don: Brad did you have a comment?

00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:53.320
&gt;&gt;Brad: Yeah I think one thing to also be
aware of, I'd just add a fourth thing to Dave's

00:12:53.320 --> 00:13:01.200
list, and do I get a card if I say Fuck too
early on? OK just checking. So there's a lot

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:05.441
of people they get confused about direct versus
indirect revenue models as well in the context

00:13:05.441 --> 00:13:09.440
of Freedium, ah Freemium and I’ll give a
good example from my experience. I was an

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:14.060
investor in FeedBurner, and FeedBurner had
a free version and then they had a $5 a month

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:20.410
version that you got a bunch of extra stuff;
you got analytics and a few other things.

00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:27.730
And when Google bought the company we had
500,000 publishers using FeedBur, ah, ah FeedBurner.

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:33.750
And of those 500,000 customers we had 2,000
of 'em that paid us $5 a month. So our $10,000

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:39.530
a month revenue stream was worthless in the
freemium model. However by having 500,000

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:45.430
publishers, we were aggregating 100's of millions
of unique ad impressions a day through all

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:51.430
of the distributions that we had and our indirect
model because advertising through those impressions.

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:55.630
And so I think one thing that a lot of companies
get side swiped in that we see early on is

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:59.680
that they have this notion of Freemium where
it's just systematically built. I mean I don’t

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:03.230
think that FeedBurner guys thought that they'd
only have 2,000 people paying for all the

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:07.540
extra happy stuff. The very first thing that
Google did was make those 2,000 users free

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:10.990
and gave those functionality across everybody
because they recognized that the value of

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:15.060
the incremental unique ad unit was much higher.
So sort of in a counter freemium model don't

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:19.880
get hung up in losing sight of the fact that
you might have a better indirect revenue opportunity

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:24.860
than direct and always challenge your free
to paid user versus what if it was all free?

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:30.260
Do we have an indirect model? There's an interesting
backlash that Freemium came from, for anybody

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.981
that sort of remembers the web tour history,
was that there were this enormous number of

00:14:33.981 --> 00:14:37.670
companies that were gonna make it up on volume,
right? They were gonna have huge enough traffic

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:41.110
that they were gonna have a big enough advertising
revenue stream. And at some point everybody

00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:44.920
realized that you know, when you have 10,000
unique users a day you can’t have enough

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:49.350
advertising to make a business. You gotta
figure out a different way to do it. So one

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:52.730
of the things to think about when you're starting
down the path of a Freemium model, is are

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:56.920
you a company who's gonna have 10's of thousands
of, or 100's of thousands of users? Or are

00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:01.121
you a company that's gonna have 50 Million
users? And if you're gonna have 50 million

00:15:01.121 --> 00:15:05.230
users and you can leverage the network effect
type activity that Dave talked about, the

00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:13.120
Freemium model may actually get in your way
relative to the indirect opportunities that

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:14.120
you have for advertising.

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:17.210
&gt;&gt;Dave: And in fact that often times the big
issue in freemium is not whether to do Freemium

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:22.870
but what’s the product feature segmentation
on the free versus the paid side. And how

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:25.510
do you sort of, like you know, which features
are we gonna put on the paid side and which

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:29.940
features are we gonna put on the free side.
In general things that are viral or growth

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:34.300
oriented probably shouldn't be on the paid
side, they should be on the free side. Ah

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:38.820
and you know, maybe stuff that sort of engages
users in more deep behavior is probably stuff

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:42.060
that you may want to consider putting on the
paid side.

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:45.940
&gt;&gt;Joe: I'd think there's real danger in the
Freemium model which is it creates a weird

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:51.290
cultural split inside your company. I saw
this at JotSpot where you're constantly having

00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:55.100
discussions about, what are we, so Dave's
point, what do we include in the free version,

00:15:55.100 --> 00:16:01.510
what do we include in the paid version? And
ah, your company can get a little, of kind

00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:06.270
of a split personality with some people pushing
for holding things back and some people pushing

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:12.190
for greater growth and it's really hard to
know what that line is. And the line evolves

00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:17.150
over time. I think the second really important
thing is pricing. And how you do pricing.

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:22.770
So one of the lessons we learnt at JotSpot,
we studied cell phone pricing a lot. If you

00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:30.910
look at Cell phone pricing, people, ah people,
if you look at large cohorts, pay one greater

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:35.610
tier than they should. And why do they do
that? Coz actually the rational thing to do

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:41.310
is pay one lower tier and the 2 months a year
you go over, you just pay the overage. you'll

00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:45.570
actually net a lower bill at the end of the
year. The reason people do it, is they’re

00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:51.550
not optimizing for lowest price, they're optimizing
for least surprise. And so one of the things

00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:57.800
we did when we looked at our tiers of pricing
at JotSpot was, how do we create a tier, like

00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:02.770
the initial two tiers let's say at $19.95
a month and $29.95 a month, had limits on

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:08.720
things like users and pages. If you went up
to $49.99 cents a month then you essentially

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:13.640
got one of those categories became unlimited.
And what we saw is our average revenue per

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:18.990
user which we tracked weekly as we adjusted
pricing plans was that people still, even

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:22.620
in software, optimized towards least surprise.
They didn't know how they were gonna use this

00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:28.770
stuff, as long as it was in the range of cheap
enough then they'd optimize to least surprise

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:32.970
and basically take the higher plan even if
they don't use it. So we saw people taking

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:37.900
plans which were essentially had an unlimited
pages component and were using by far fewer

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:41.750
pages than they could have at the next price
level down. But they did it because they were

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:42.750
pricing for least surprise.

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:45.840
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Interesting. Very Interesting.
So that's a good Segway into my next

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:49.680
&gt;&gt;xxx: [talks over presenter] Super awesome,
like feedback. The point that I wanted to

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:53.320
make though about the other thing you said
was you think it develops a split personality.

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:57.350
I actually think that's Okay. because I think
there's, you know, there's two things you

00:17:57.350 --> 00:18:00.250
wanna optimize for when you're running these
businesses. One is you're trying to optimize

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:03.640
for user happiness or utility. The other one
is you're trying to optimize for business

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:07.710
value. And sometimes you're playing a zero
sum game with that. Hopefully not always.

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:11.250
[laughs]. And great businesses are where you're
not playing zero sum games with those two

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:15.460
things. but I think its actually OK to have
a customer advocate in your company who's

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:18.630
always trying to like figure out what’s
gonna make the comp, customer the most happy.

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:22.120
And somebody else is hey we have to keep the
lights on, how do we make the most value in

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:26.090
the business. And having that you know, that
dichotomy of conversation on an ongoing basis

00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:27.580
is probably ok in my opinion.

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:30.809
&gt;&gt;Joe: I'll revise the statement. What's actually
important is that you start from the beginning

00:18:30.809 --> 00:18:35.980
with the model you imagine yourself to have.
Meaning, too many companies when they start

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:40.130
up, basically put their product in Beta before
putting their business model in beta. So what

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:42.520
they do is they typically release a free product,
they don't have any pricing on the thing,

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:47.390
and they start to get a bunch of users, and
the users get excited. They have a fully featured

00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:51.950
product. And then the conversation starts
to go like this; you have 10,000 users, 20,000

00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:57.170
users and you start to get nervous. Well gosh,
if we introduce a pay wall, how is that gonna

00:18:57.170 --> 00:19:00.990
change our growth? And boy we seem to be valued
and get all the love and feedback inside the

00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:03.760
company and these people from the outside
who might fund us, love us because we seem

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:06.850
to be on this user ramp, so all I’m saying
is, at the very beginning, make a decision

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:12.290
and put your business model into beta at the
same time you put your initial product into

00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:15.910
beta. And that way you don't have the tough
conversations being really nervous that you're

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:18.730
gonna retard growth ramps that aren't really
real.

00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:25.830
&gt;&gt;Brad: I'd also add knowing that, and I agree
with Joe's sort of approximate 2% conversion,

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:29.130
maybe it's a little more, there's a coupla
cases where it spikes up a little higher but

00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:37.780
it's a low percentage. I think that if you
try to implement or sort of over architect

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:43.290
it too early, you also don't understand what
you're doing. Because let's say that you said

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:47.300
that we're going to have a Premium model,
we're going to have some extra features, you

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:50.400
get some user adoption and you put out your
freemium model. This is the free one. This

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:56.640
is the $14.95 a month, versus 15 a month because
someone told you, you should be $14.95 a month.

00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:02.580
And um, you got the wrong segmentation. If
you don't have tension early around what that

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:06.550
segmentation is, you'll stick and anchor on
that segmentation and you'll slow your user

00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:11.510
growth down. SO what I tend to see works is,
you know you're gonna introduce a pay wall

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:15.330
at some point, but you wait until you have
enough robustness in the product before you

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:19.640
start to do that segmentation. And you play
around with that segmentation. And I think

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:24.540
the dissonance in the company in that case
is super helpful. Coz then you'll have people

00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:28.730
in the company fighting for the user; this
has to be a core feature, it can't be a paid

00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:32.050
feature, and then you'll have somebody else
make the argument yeah but this is why people

00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:36.180
are going to pay for us. And you have to get
that conversation going in the companies,

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:41.470
and FeedBurner was an example, oh yeah we'll
just add stats on and people will pay us extra

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:44.200
for stats, and the answer was no they won't.
And oh by the way if we'd had Stats for free

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.200
we probably would've had more adoption coz
there would've been some people who would've

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.200
said ah we'll get some extra benefits from
this.

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:55.440
&gt;&gt;Jeff: I think FeedBurner was a good example
of a product where it was so good on the free

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:59.600
side that there was absolutely no reason for
you to take the paid one. It's only when they

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:04.300
introduced the notion of advertising where
you would get paid for impressions that I

00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:08.059
felt compelled to pay them something because
I felt guilty. So introduce guilt.

00:21:08.059 --> 00:21:12.300
&gt;&gt;Brad: that's interesting coz they didn't
need you to feel guilty because they took

00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:15.750
a percentage of the advertising revenue, right?
So they didn't care. The interesting thing

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:20.470
was they had competitors who charged for their
functionality. They actually got the right

00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:25.420
mix I think of lots of functionality for free
because the people that charged a relatively

00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:29.141
small amount for the other functionality ended
up with like 17 people using their product

00:21:29.141 --> 00:21:32.640
and FeedBurner ended up with half a million.
So that’s the other side of the equation,

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:36.250
which is that if you're going after scale
you have to really concentrate on where you're

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:40.650
segmenting to go after scale. I think that
is part of the problem then with the enterprise

00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:44.240
type activities coz if you're selling into
an enterprise customer, now lets not talk

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:47.470
about the very small business, but sort of
anything else, you're still dealing with an

00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:50.180
Oracle sales force, you're still dealing with
a Microsoft sales force, you're still fighting

00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:54.670
against SAS, so you've gotta figure out a
different approach into the customer still

00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:57.140
on top of a different engagement model.

00:21:57.140 --> 00:22:03.950
&gt;&gt;Don: So if the free product is so good that
there's no reason to pay, then you’re only

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:09.670
alternative then is to say well we'll limit
capacity. Right? So you can only do a hundred

00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:15.600
a month or a thousand a month, or whatever
the scale is, so. That's really the tough

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:20.130
problem. Where do you draw the line? Do you
draw the line to say we're going to hold back

00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:26.780
certain features and make those the Premium
that you pay for? Or we're gonna give them

00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:31.530
but limit capacity and have them pay if they
go over capacity. So how have you seen that

00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:32.530
work and what are your recommendations?

00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:35.510
&gt;&gt;Jeff: It really depends on the product.
I think that if there is a notion of quota

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:40.179
of capacity, I think DropBox is a great example.
I'm not involved in Dropbox but I think it's

00:22:40.179 --> 00:22:45.550
an awesome product. So you get 2GB for free
and you can pay for like, whatever, 10 or

00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:51.110
something like that. And I think that in between
there is a very large band of users who will

00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:55.860
sort of, try and force themselves to stay
in the 2, because 2GB is pretty large for

00:22:55.860 --> 00:23:02.080
Web Storage. But what Drew said, the CEO,
is that if they were to lower that ball to

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:06.370
try and introduce an interim sort of step
they would actually lose money because people,

00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:15.471
just as Joe said, just graduating to the 10GB
offer just for safety. And so when you have

00:23:15.471 --> 00:23:19.059
those kinds of products you can definitely
sort of play on storage capacity limitations.

00:23:19.059 --> 00:23:23.660
I think that the whole limitation on product
is dangerous because there's always sort of

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:27.860
something you want the users to experience
to make sure you maintain a competitive edge.

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:32.720
&gt;&gt;Matt: I think the other opportunity there
is as you're starting on your journey, is

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:40.100
you need to be clear on the runway. And useful
functionality for an individual for the discussion,

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:45.530
and set that mark at something that they delight
in, and they're really happy about but hopefully

00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:51.520
have some more to drive some individual conversion.
On the business apps side though, is you know,

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:55.640
you could really have a very useful individual
product and your goal very well could be,

00:23:55.640 --> 00:24:02.700
I'm gonna up sell the group. And that can
work beautifully. And so, but if you don't

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:06.060
have enough runway individually, and you don't
really have group value in the enterprise,

00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:08.770
it may not be something you want to embark
on.

00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:12.230
&gt;&gt;Don: We have a question from the audience
here. Let's take that one.

00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:15.860
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 1: [Strong middle eastern
accent] I want to know individually which

00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:20.140
characteristics does a good business has,
have for each one of you?

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:21.830
&gt;&gt;Don: What characteristics would a business
have for this?

00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:26.170
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 1: Yes. What business, which
characteristics for a good business have in,

00:24:26.170 --> 00:24:33.520
have? It's a question for each one of you.

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:45.430
&gt;&gt;Don: Oh, so does it have to be viral, does
it have to be consumer, or what kind of characteristics

00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:46.430
do you look for? Is that the question?

00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:47.430
&gt;&gt;Dave: I think it's

00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:48.430
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 1: I will, well, I would like
to hear more about the values of, now we have

00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:49.780
to protect our investors, now we have to be
true our, these characteristics of the product,

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:58.980
or we have to be true our self or?

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:03.710
&gt;&gt;Dave: I think I guess I would say, well
the awesome product of course is the real

00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:08.900
time viral croupon. I mean like that's obviously
going to get everybody to get their check

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:12.320
books out. Um, but I think one of the things
we've been sort of talking about is getting

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:14.880
to the essence of what's the value to the
user. And

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:17.220
&gt;&gt;Brad: Virtual goods.

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:22.440
&gt;&gt;Dave: Right, right. Virtual goods. Um coz
I was going to say Joe's comment about not

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:26.790
shipping your product without putting your
business model into beta is pretty on target.

00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:31.960
But um, getting to the sort of, reverse psychology
in this, I don't know how many of you have

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:36.790
read Predictably Irrational? but I think that's
a great book to read before you start trying

00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:42.760
to think about, uh, any type of Freemium model
because some of your intuitions about how

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:48.559
people are going to react to pricing are very,
very different. In particular I think there

00:25:48.559 --> 00:25:52.890
are times when you can charge for something
that people perceive more value than when

00:25:52.890 --> 00:25:57.850
you give it away. So the behavioral aspects
of sort of having something free or not free

00:25:57.850 --> 00:26:04.799
are not gonna at all look like what your expectations
are there. So, in fact founder of a company

00:26:04.799 --> 00:26:07.730
in Japan, the largest cooking site in Japan,
Cookpad, founder Aki Sano built a business

00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:14.690
over about 12 or 13 years. they went public
last year doing very, very well. He actually

00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:17.710
thinks completely different about it in that
he doesn’t want a launch anything that people

00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:22.510
wouldn’t pay for right out of the gate.
because it sort of sets a way that users think

00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:26.880
about your product to be value oriented. And
I'm not saying that works for everybody but

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:33.200
really establishing , you know, the value
of your product is probably more important

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:38.170
than understanding pricing models right away.
So getting to the essence of your product

00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:43.020
is probably the first priority and then figuring
out how do you layer on pricing that’s either

00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:45.070
free or discounted on top of that.

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:51.260
&gt;&gt;Don: Brad mentioned virtual goods. And I
know brad is an investor in Zynga which makes

00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:52.960
a ton of money on virtual goods.

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:54.090
[inaudible comment from Dave]

00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:56.620
&gt;&gt;Don: [laughs] Well it was in that case

00:26:56.620 --> 00:27:00.380
&gt;&gt;Brad: Well I mentioned virtual goods just
to be part of the trend of word dropping.

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:02.300
Um Dave's point is profound, I want to emphasis
it, actually

00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:03.300
&gt;&gt;Dave: I agree with you, my point was profound.

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:15.010
&gt;&gt;Brad: It's fucking profound. [laughs] Um,
it's really, really important, your instinct

00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:21.210
about what the consumer, or sorry, what your
customer, business or consumer will pay for

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:30.679
or not pay for, is likely wrong. It's very
easy to come out with a model after you've

00:27:30.679 --> 00:27:34.740
read some blogs and talked to some people
and thought in the bathroom about something.

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:40.610
And it's probably going to be wrong. So you
have to be agile and flexible enough early

00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:45.590
in the life curve of your business if you're
going to approach this model. To be able to

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:50.500
listen to your customer feedback, your user
feedback . And also have the right premise.

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:55.419
If you're premise around your business is
that you have to have 100 million people using

00:27:55.419 --> 00:28:01.960
your thing, and your thing is not viral in
any way shape or form, it will not work. If

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:06.940
your premise is that you only need 10,000
people to pay you $1000 a month and life is

00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:12.250
good, Free may not be your path. Or the thing
that you do for free may be different. So

00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:18.260
testing it aggressively and iterating is important,
but hanging on to Dave's concept that your

00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:21.780
intuition is probably not right. The other
thing I just want to weigh in, which Don said

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:26.090
is what if your free product is so good that
you know, the free version is all anybody

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:31.910
will ever need? And that assumes stasis, assumes
that nothing changes. And everything’s changing

00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:35.971
constantly and evolving constantly and I think
that’s another opportunity where once you

00:28:35.971 --> 00:28:41.090
start to have enough users finding the one
or two percent of users who are fanatical

00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:46.640
about your product and having them help you
segment where the pay wall should be is actually

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:47.640
quite useful.

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:51.930
&gt;&gt;Dave: I think an interesting case of that
is LinkedIn. So I mean LinkedIn is a clear

00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:56.600
case of products free, I don't know why I
would ever pay for what they currently are

00:28:56.600 --> 00:29:02.100
charging the users for in their freemium model.
And they monetize generally on, really a special

00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:05.600
segment of users which is BizDev and recruiters
and other things. Now I don't know whether

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:09.640
that's right or not, I actually think there's
potentially a chance they should have charged

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:13.760
for the business premium users coz I sure
as hell would pay $20-$50 a month for the

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:18.950
value that I get out of LinkedIn. But they
chose this model where OK we're gonna give

00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:23.700
the user a bunch of benefit with really not
too much limitations on functionality and

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:27.700
monetize a completely different user segment
that will pay coz there's large network effects

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:28.700
going on.

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:33.920
&gt;&gt;Brad: There's large value from the people
that will pay disproportionately high for

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:38.520
the other 98%, or whatever the percent is
that won't pay anything at all. Right? So

00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:44.280
you might pay $50 a month for it, but somebody
else will pay $500 or $1000 bucks a month

00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:49.830
for it or $5000 and so they need a whole lot
less people paying to make the same aggregate

00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:54.299
revenue. So again, there's so many pieces
in it that's sort of looking for that right

00:29:54.299 --> 00:29:58.680
spot that actually I think having a competence
or, this is you know, back to Joe's point

00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:05.049
about you know, you have two parts to the
company once you start sort of rolling down

00:30:05.049 --> 00:30:07.440
that path, figure out how to let that dissonance
be part of your decision making process in

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:10.150
a constructive way, I think is really powerful.

00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:14.980
&gt;&gt;Don: Ok we have another question from the
audience.

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:17.850
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 2: [Japanese accent] Hello,
my name is Yohalven from Taipei. I have one

00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:22.720
comment and one question. The first comment
is that you mentioned many different models

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:30.810
of revenue and it feels to me as if Freemium
is mostly when dealing with direct consumer

00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:37.669
when we're talking about giving them away,
the product for free, when we can get moneys

00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:42.900
in other ways like advertisement that was
mentioned here, and information collection.

00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:48.340
So I wonder about the balance between those
different models. And the second thing is

00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:54.920
that you mentioned Zynga a few minutes ago.
And Zynga have a different model, Zynga give

00:30:54.920 --> 00:31:02.190
the product completely for free. And they
ask their consumer to pay by enabling features,

00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:08.900
by paying for them every time. You actually
buy coins, you buy virtual currency, you pay

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:12.530
for specific features. After a while you have
to buy those again. So it's another, it seems

00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:20.390
like another model of Freemium and I would
be happy to hear your comments about it.

00:31:20.390 --> 00:31:24.930
&gt;&gt;Joe: So ah, obviously Brad knows most about
Zynga, but I've spent a bunch of time looking

00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:30.960
in kind of mobile gaming space where economics
are slightly different but the mechanisms

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:37.300
are the same. And I'll compare it to a bunch
of stuff that comes out of, um, Neil Young

00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:42.590
from NGMoko talked a lot about his metrics
at the Game Developers Conference a while

00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:47.970
ago. So what’s interesting about their metrics
is that on a daily basis they see that 2%

00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:51.740
of their audience are buying something with
virtual goods. Now one of the most important

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:57.230
parts in that model is that they're a legitimate
play path and a legitimate pay path. And that

00:31:57.230 --> 00:32:02.419
balance is really important. I don’t know
what the analogue in Business software would

00:32:02.419 --> 00:32:09.280
be personally, but that 2% kind of scales
well to other data points that I was mentioning

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:17.049
earlier about 2%. The more interesting part
to me is that ah, about 25% of their audience

00:32:17.049 --> 00:32:23.510
will do something in exchange for the paid
currency, typically in the mobile case in,

00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:28.990
cost per install advertising, um and so in
that particular case as you mentioned the

00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:34.070
balancing act. And then a third component
is essentially display advertising. But all

00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:41.060
of that adds up in to the magnitude of 15
cents a daily active user per day. So it's

00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:46.610
a amazing how collecting pennies over enough
users where you combining Freemium where you're

00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:50.890
actually getting revenue directly from customer
base. But where that again seems to be tapping

00:32:50.890 --> 00:32:57.590
out at about 2%. Where you have other people
willing to get value in the game in exchange

00:32:57.590 --> 00:33:02.900
for doing some other action that you can monetize.
This is kind of akin to what Brad was talking

00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:08.241
about in terms of indirect monetization with
advertising in the case of FeedBurner and

00:33:08.241 --> 00:33:13.860
then obviously advertising, so. Anyway that's
just another example of another revenue mix

00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:15.059
that might be interesting.

00:33:15.059 --> 00:33:20.720
&gt;&gt;Don: You've mentioned the 2% conversion
rate a couple of times. I did a survey of

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:29.150
25 companies that are using Freemium model.
And it was very close, but my results were

00:33:29.150 --> 00:33:34.390
between 3% and 5% depending on the price point
that they were charging. Lower price point

00:33:34.390 --> 00:33:41.940
got 5% conversion, the lower price, 3%. So
if your business models have rates of 10%

00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:47.060
or 20% you're smoking something, it's not
right. Its gonna be between 2 and 5%

00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:51.190
&gt;&gt;Joe: On this point I think there's 2 kind
of follow-on’s I wanna make. One is that

00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:55.830
entrepreneurs live in a reality distortion
field, I've been there many times. I love

00:33:55.830 --> 00:34:00.100
my little bubble. But the reality is that
most people don't know what you're talking

00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:04.679
about with your product. And so there was
an earlier question about should you charge

00:34:04.679 --> 00:34:08.500
for holding back features. The reality is
most people are not going to pay you for your

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:11.200
features. You think your features are incredibly
valuable. yeah but you spend 24/7 thinking

00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:16.010
about your product and understanding what
the value of those features are. It is likely

00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:18.790
not gonna happen. I very much personally prefer
the notion of being aligned with your customer.

00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:23.000
The more they use the product the more they're
seeing value the deeper they’re getting

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.280
in it, then they're willing to pay something.
That’s at least my own impression. You need

00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:31.220
to hold some carrots out there or some words
that make people feel like they're getting

00:34:31.220 --> 00:34:36.580
a little more value than just additional stuff
for what they're already using. But again

00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:40.830
I strongly prefer things that are aligned
with the way the customers using the product.

00:34:40.830 --> 00:34:44.630
And avoid the trap of thinking that customers
are gonna pay for features, they won't . Customers

00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:49.320
don't pay typically for analytics. they don't
pay to turn ads off. they don't pay for, at

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:52.580
least in the enterprise case they will, but
in the consumer case they're not gonna pay

00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:58.440
for better support for the most part. Um,
so, that's one. Two is, always remember, at

00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:01.859
least in, again and this is my own personal
opinion, it's much easier to raise prices

00:35:01.859 --> 00:35:06.119
than to lower prices. So I always like starting
with lower price points and creeping them

00:35:06.119 --> 00:35:10.310
up very aggressively and measuring on a weekly
basis what I'm seeing in terms of average

00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:13.980
revenue for account. The reason its easier
to raise prices than to lower prices? The

00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:18.040
people who got the earlier price feel like
they got a smoking deal. When you lower prices,

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:24.359
they're very pissed off. So it's counter intuitive,
people are afraid to raise prices. Raise prices,

00:35:24.359 --> 00:35:26.390
it's not hard compared to lowering prices.

00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:33.900
&gt;&gt;Jeff: A couple of comments. One is um, on
the 2-5%, it depends whether you look at your

00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:36.860
overall user base or your active users. Coz
typically you're going to try and focus on

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:41.150
your active users in terms of conversions.
So you’re gonna see a much higher conversion

00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:46.810
rate by definition coz your active users is
a lower population. In terms of the consumer,

00:35:46.810 --> 00:35:52.300
people actually pay for convenience. Um, one
of my companies did something that you shouldn't

00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:57.160
do, which is they actually took something
which was available for free and they made

00:35:57.160 --> 00:36:01.990
it only available behind the pay wall. And
there was a pure revolution amongst the user

00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:07.790
base. But you know, after a year we ended
up with a 4 person, 4 percent conversion rate,

00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:12.650
we were making millions of dollars on that
4%. And we just went past the renewals, so

00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:18.760
after a year we were very anxious looking
at the turn we'd have on this sort of year,

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:24.880
after a year of activity. And so far we've
seen 70% of people sort of renewing. So I'm

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:30.060
not suggesting to piss off your users. But
be aware that at some point if you have a

00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:35.540
product that is really sticky and people want
to use, and that's convenient, and they will

00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:36.540
actually pay.

00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:46.170
&gt;&gt;Matt: I think this brings up a point about
instrumentation and really knowing usage.

00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:50.540
and so It drives on two things. One, the active
user retention is something that generally

00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:56.080
SAS companies aren't thinking about because
they're only talking about paid user retention.

00:36:56.080 --> 00:37:00.500
But thinking about active user retention,
instrumenting the service, really knowing

00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:04.960
the clicks and streams and functionality that
people are using and how to engage them, is

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:08.800
a really, really big point. Not only for you
getting them to convert but for them to go

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:15.119
tell their friends. And this brings up a big
difference between what I'll call kind of

00:37:15.119 --> 00:37:19.650
early recurring revenue model businesses and
kind of early SAS and these in that these

00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:25.770
are really service businesses at the end of
the day. I mean people, in fact in many of

00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:30.370
these companies 40-60% of the employees are
in technical support and customer service

00:37:30.370 --> 00:37:35.760
and they think that's great. because they’re
really worried about active users, telling

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:36.760
their friends and then driving conversion
and then doing the work to make sure all that

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:37.760
all of those things happen. Contrast that
with kind of historical on the business apps

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:49.090
side where 50 or 60% of the folks were selling,
in this case it's 40 or 60% are services and

00:37:49.090 --> 00:37:54.310
it really speaks to some of the cultural differences
between these entities and those that came

00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:55.310
before.

00:37:55.310 --> 00:38:00.800
&gt;&gt;Brad: One comment on Analytics and then
one comment on sort of the context of Freemium

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:04.560
at the infrastructure layer in terms of the
infrastructure service which we haven't really

00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:10.609
touched on, that I think is becoming increasingly
visible. Raise your hand if you have a company,

00:38:10.609 --> 00:38:17.950
an active company today. Keep your hands up.
Lower your hand if you don't get a detailed

00:38:17.950 --> 00:38:22.331
statistics report everyday on daily active
users and what they're doing in the application?

00:38:22.331 --> 00:38:32.260
Be honest. [laughter] Okay. 25-33%. 100% of
you should be obsessed with that. And every

00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:38.770
company at the very earliest stages, even
if you have four people using your software,

00:38:38.770 --> 00:38:44.270
you have somewhere between 5 and 10 daily
metrics that you should get every day and

00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:48.490
you should think about and then think about
them on a weekly basis and a monthly basis.

00:38:48.490 --> 00:38:54.090
And Dave's got brilliant stuff on SlideShare
about this. And on his site, no, not about

00:38:54.090 --> 00:38:58.960
the actual metrics you should look at. but
understanding those metrics and understanding

00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:04.000
the difference between a daily active user,
a weekly and a monthly active user , understanding

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.920
what they're doing in the application, and
understanding how that changes over time especially

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:14.340
when you change the application. It's so critical
early on and so many startups I encounter

00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:19.599
have no idea what it is. I love the reports
that say you know, have a handful of columns

00:39:19.599 --> 00:39:27.220
on a daily basis, you know 7,7,8,8,14 because
that day it went from 8 to 14 you can say

00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:32.560
well what happened there? Like what was it?
And very early understanding those nuances

00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:37.460
will help you understand the dynamics here,
but don't, sort of defaulting into the 2%

00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:42.550
Jeff’s point of, is it daily users? Is it
sign ups? Then shift into the infrastructure

00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:46.210
thing, you're seeing more and more companies
like this. We just made an investment yesterday

00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:51.300
in a company in Boulder called Simple GO,
and we have another investment that should

00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:56.651
close by the end of the month that has exactly
the same type of approach where it's a free

00:39:56.651 --> 00:40:01.510
infrastructure service for certain number
of, for a certain amount of usage, a certain

00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:06.619
number of API calls, a certain volume of activity
you can use this service for free and integrate

00:40:06.619 --> 00:40:11.369
into your service. Once you get above some
level then you have some tier pricing based

00:40:11.369 --> 00:40:16.790
on your consumption. So if there, SendGrid
would be another one that we're all in that

00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:21.950
we recently let around and that Jeff and Dave
are also in. It's one of those things where

00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:26.630
the infrastructure piece of it, you, this
is a business service, you want lots of people

00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:31.560
to try it and you're willing to have that,
that marginal cost on your side because it's

00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:36.339
cloud based, it's cloud deployed, your marginal
cost is relatively low. When there's user

00:40:36.339 --> 00:40:41.880
value, user's will happily pay your paid service
once you get above that hurdle. So it's again

00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:48.020
the same kind of thing. If you have a thousand
people sign up and zero use it pass that sign

00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:52.330
up period, nobody's gonna pay you $5000 a
month for it. If you’re not tracking it

00:40:52.330 --> 00:40:56.380
you have no idea, and you could be telling
yourself oh yeah we got lots of people signing

00:40:56.380 --> 00:41:00.869
up every day, why aren't we getting anybody
to convert into actual real users. So getting

00:41:00.869 --> 00:41:02.680
those pieces lined up is really important.

00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:08.830
&gt;&gt;Don: Great advice. Write that down. if you
aren't collecting analytics on how your users

00:41:08.830 --> 00:41:13.619
are using your application, you're flying
blind. And if you succeed its gonna be total

00:41:13.619 --> 00:41:15.570
luck. So make sure you do that.

00:41:15.570 --> 00:41:19.400
&gt;&gt;Dave: On that point, the other thing I was
going to say is looking at a sort of unsubscribe

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:24.849
report or at least a cohort analysis for retention
over time. Like I think a lot of times understanding

00:41:24.849 --> 00:41:29.339
what your balance is gonna be on a Freemium
model or how much you wanna charge for your

00:41:29.339 --> 00:41:32.860
product whether it's free or not, is based
on an average customer lifecycle. And like,

00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:37.001
a lot of people do look at daily reports or
look at aggregated stats where users are of

00:41:37.001 --> 00:41:42.119
a different age, and you may not be able to
tell as much from that, unless you're looking

00:41:42.119 --> 00:41:46.640
at the cohort that's just new user behavior
within a certain time period. So like an interesting

00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:50.230
report that’s probably a pain the ass to
generate but useful to look at is kind of

00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:55.440
a look back from current time frame of users
in the same week, or users in the same month.

00:41:55.440 --> 00:42:00.640
So here's a cohort of users from 3 months
back, whets their behavior been? Ok here is

00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:05.940
the next one week you know, cohort, we changed
something then what happened to the subscribe

00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:10.050
rates or unsubscribe rates. And so getting
an understanding of what’s your average

00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:15.670
customer like, retention over a billing period,
and starting to build some understanding of

00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:20.099
customer acquisition cost and then figuring
out if you're upside down or not on that is

00:42:20.099 --> 00:42:21.901
probably essential to understanding if you
have a business.

00:42:21.901 --> 00:42:24.600
&gt;&gt;Don: We have two questions from the audience.
Lets go there.

00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:30.920
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 2: Hi there, my name is Mike
I'm from Winnipeg, Canada and I have a privately

00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:36.550
funded small startup that we're doing a booking
application. And we have sort of a big vision

00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:44.570
to sort of take it to a one stop, ah, appointment
booking shop for common services which kind

00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:47.760
of isn't out there from what I've seen. And
so one of the things we're trying to do, and

00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:51.910
now, and what I wanted to ask you is basically
we're trying to figure out our pricing model

00:42:51.910 --> 00:43:00.660
and potentially some sort of a freemium model
and trying to figure out whether a pay as

00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:04.440
you go pricing, and in our scenario it could
work coz we're trying to sell initially a

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:05.970
web application that lets businesses schedule
appointments essentially. So its not new,

00:43:05.970 --> 00:43:15.839
there's already companies doing this but we
just think we can do it better. Now traditionally

00:43:15.839 --> 00:43:22.220
most, most, most of our competitors are pricing
on a tiered pricing model. Um, I'm really

00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:32.050
wondering if a pay as you go model is better
in that you know, for a small shop that's

00:43:32.050 --> 00:43:34.582
only booking a few appointments, why are they
going to pay $20 a month right? Where they

00:43:34.582 --> 00:43:41.089
can pay a few cents per appointment, kind
of thing. And then how does that fit in with

00:43:41.089 --> 00:43:50.570
the freemium model and how would you transition
that?

00:43:50.570 --> 00:43:56.030
&gt;&gt;Don: A crowded market. I know. I saw Yori
Nelken here early from Timebridge, Tungle,

00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:59.099
so there's a bunch of companies in there trying
to do this, and they all have slightly different

00:43:59.099 --> 00:44:00.099
business models.

00:44:00.099 --> 00:44:02.539
&gt;&gt;Joe: I'm only scared of pay as you go models
mainly because they’re unpredictable and

00:44:02.539 --> 00:44:09.210
people get scared of what they don't know.
So the fact is they might think, it's interesting

00:44:09.210 --> 00:44:14.650
people tend to go towards what if I did a
thousand appointments this month strangely,

00:44:14.650 --> 00:44:20.100
I don't think I will but what if that happened?
So I tend not to, I tend not to like those

00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:23.090
as much mainly coz what you're really are
looking for is you don’t want customers

00:44:23.090 --> 00:44:28.180
to have to think very hard. And they have
to think when it's a pay as you go model coz

00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:31.410
then they have to stop and think well how
many appointments do I really book coz most

00:44:31.410 --> 00:44:37.750
people don't actually know. It would be my
instincts, but that's why I tend not to favor

00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:38.750
those.

00:44:38.750 --> 00:44:46.541
&gt;&gt;Matt: I think it's also, you have to be
careful on the bond math, in all of this and

00:44:46.541 --> 00:44:50.070
you have to be clear as Dave explained earlier
in the customer lifecycle, and so your cost

00:44:50.070 --> 00:44:59.099
to get a free user, your cost to get a paid
user and then how much are they gonna pay

00:44:59.099 --> 00:45:01.690
you? If they pay you up front for a year,
they basically have recouped the cost of marketing

00:45:01.690 --> 00:45:04.900
to them. And then what's the monthly retention
look like on GoForward, coz you're effectively,

00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:10.130
you'll be financing their pay as you go. And
if that bond math all works, that's all free

00:45:10.130 --> 00:45:14.280
coming in to you , they all love your service,
and 99% of them will stay, and you're winning

00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:17.330
coz its pay per use, that bond math might
work, but you have to run that bond math all

00:45:17.330 --> 00:45:22.490
the way through. And in these businesses in
particular coz we're talking about retention,

00:45:22.490 --> 00:45:26.090
these are very different business application
retention rates than SAS or other services.

00:45:26.090 --> 00:45:32.940
They're one to ten to 15% churn per month.
If you 15% churn per month, at the end of

00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:38.050
the year you don't have a lot left, right?
So but people think about those differently

00:45:38.050 --> 00:45:41.510
coz people move in and they move out and they’ll
do it for 3 months and they'll come back and

00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:46.119
how do you think about, you know, that math?
So I guess all it really comes down to what's

00:45:46.119 --> 00:45:52.839
the bond math really look like for your full
customer lifecycle for paid, and if that works

00:45:52.839 --> 00:45:55.310
and enable you to differentiate, then that
may work except for the, kind of the fear

00:45:55.310 --> 00:45:59.119
questions that Joe surfaced. But you wanna
run it all the way through.

00:45:59.119 --> 00:46:01.170
&gt;&gt;Don: Let's get another question.

00:46:01.170 --> 00:46:06.640
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 3: Hi. Ah, you guys talk a
lot about the subscription model where user

00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:12.660
pays month after month, ah what do you think
of the model that seems to be in the mobile

00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:17.161
space quite a bit where there's like App Lite,
then theirs Full App and the App Lite is free

00:46:17.161 --> 00:46:26.991
and then the user jumps over the wall once
and pays a large bulk of money to get the

00:46:26.991 --> 00:46:27.991
full featured app?

00:46:27.991 --> 00:46:30.870
&gt;&gt;Jeff: That's been very popular as a model
on the apps tour because that was the only

00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:35.410
way for companies to have a Premium model.
Where there was not the In App [unintelligible]

00:46:35.410 --> 00:46:45.370
in existence. And so the math typically would
lead to a, surprise, surprise, 2-4% conversion

00:46:45.370 --> 00:46:52.770
where the price point, so at Apputers' which
is one of the largest App on the App store,

00:46:52.770 --> 00:47:00.070
we sort of did a demand curve to try and see
what the optimal pricing was. And essentially,

00:47:00.070 --> 00:47:10.710
once again surprise, surprise, you know $4.99
seemed to be optimal. Now that you have an

00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:13.040
opportunity to charge in App, you really want
to do your math because essentially if you're

00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:19.000
able to get consumers to buy things on a repeated
basis, you know, $1.99 two track song, or

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:25.790
you know whatever sells on, um, on some first
person tutor, you will have a recurring revenue

00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:30.109
of sorts that will make you way more than
that $4.99 and so.

00:47:30.109 --> 00:47:37.440
&gt;&gt;Brad: I think it sucks and I think as a
function of a limitation of the app store,

00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:44.089
sort of the first wave of it and here's why.
We're talking now about bits not atoms, right?

00:47:44.089 --> 00:47:50.080
So bits cost us nothing. The storage cost
to them is nothing, the distribution cost

00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:57.250
to them is nothing from a manufacture perspective.
So you'd never want a customer to be a single

00:47:57.250 --> 00:48:02.970
purchase, or single instance experience because
all of your effort is to get engagement with

00:48:02.970 --> 00:48:07.380
that customer. And if they have a single instance
experience to pay you for something, whether

00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:15.130
it's $1.99, $4.99, $4,000 for your bits and
you don't have another way to keep doing it,

00:48:15.130 --> 00:48:19.520
all that effort to get that customer to write
that check the first time, go back to Joe's

00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:24.940
point earlier, psychologically, or philosophically
don't make people think hard. I love this

00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:29.720
thing you do, I want more of it, oh it costs
me more money, Ok here's more money. But if

00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:35.750
I can't ever give you more money, I won't.
Right? So I think you know Jeff's point was

00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:40.270
exactly right, but I'll just put a point on
it, was it was a constraint, not a feature.

00:48:40.270 --> 00:48:45.180
And it's something that I think will always
exist. I mean you can still buy PC software

00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:50.920
and pay $29 bucks one time for it. And once
you've paid your 29 bucks, it's not like the

00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:54.520
new version comes out, you want the new version
for free or for whatever your upgrade price

00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:55.600
is, but you're not gonna pay anything more
than $2.99 for your annual maintenance agreement

00:48:55.600 --> 00:49:03.619
because you're only willing to pay 10% of
it. right, it's just, its a tough place relative

00:49:03.619 --> 00:49:07.880
to the fact that the storage shipping distribution
costs of this thing is zero. Sorry I didn't

00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:09.220
mean to grab it.

00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:20.099
&gt;&gt;Jeff: You did. [laughs]. Um, I agree with
Brad, I would just say that once again, once

00:49:20.099 --> 00:49:23.110
you have enough distribution you have enough
freedom to do a bunch of different things

00:49:23.110 --> 00:49:30.570
in terms of spatial versions and, and that’s
a recurring visual GUI or whatever you sell.

00:49:30.570 --> 00:49:33.130
And essentially the goal is to increase the
[unintelligible] of the customer. And as long

00:49:33.130 --> 00:49:40.910
as you create things that they want to buy
through different channels then you're off

00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:47.320
to a good start. But I would just say that
the one time hey, I sold my app for like five

00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:49.980
bucks and that's it. It's just not an attractive
model at all.

00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:52.720
&gt;&gt;Don: Ok, we only have a few minutes left,
so we're going to go to the lightening round

00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:57.240
now. Short questions, and 30 second answers.
Next question

00:49:57.240 --> 00:50:00.450
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 5: Ah, You all talk about

00:50:00.450 --> 00:50:02.170
&gt;&gt;Don: Speak up. We can't hear you.

00:50:02.170 --> 00:50:06.079
&gt;&gt; Audience Male 5: Yes. You talk about having
a business plan before you start. But you

00:50:06.079 --> 00:50:18.890
also talk about how your always wrong, or
your often wrong, how do you make sure that

00:50:18.890 --> 00:50:25.760
you are not stuck in the bubble where a better
business plan , sorry, could be available

00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:26.760
but you just don't see it because you're in
a bubble?

00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:27.760
&gt;&gt;Don: Analytics

00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:29.151
&gt;&gt;Joe: Yeah, I was just going to basically
say, the HP famous phrase is you make what

00:50:29.151 --> 00:50:34.839
you measure. And so my only piece of advice
on that particular front is, and I've screwed

00:50:34.839 --> 00:50:40.160
this up twice, is get your analytics in place
before you launch that product. Invariably

00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:44.460
in every product discussion before launch
that I've ever had inside a company is always,

00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:49.750
it's the last thing, it's not done, but we're
at some event so we're going to launch the

00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:53.520
product on that particular day. We can't get
our dashboards done, we'll do it the week

00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:57.880
after the launch, and it happens 5 months
later because you're incredibly busy.

00:50:57.880 --> 00:50:59.910
&gt;&gt;Jeff: And in order to discover things

00:50:59.910 --> 00:51:02.830
[audience member off Mic comments]

00:51:02.830 --> 00:51:06.170
&gt;&gt;Joe: The point was start logging the data
before you can even analyze it. That's right.

00:51:06.170 --> 00:51:12.210
&gt;&gt;Jeff: And you try new things on a sub-portion
of your user base. You do split testing, you

00:51:12.210 --> 00:51:18.670
try things, like special [unintelligible]
or whatever. If you want to change the business

00:51:18.670 --> 00:51:19.670
model, obviously you don't want to change
the entire thing. But if you have a hunch

00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:24.340
based on your usage data, that there is another
opportunity, then you try your opportunity

00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:25.690
on just a cohort or something.

00:51:25.690 --> 00:51:27.800
&gt;&gt;Don: Next question. We got to go.

00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:31.480
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 6: Just clarifying. Testing
and integration is great for local Macs optimization,

00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:35.660
it's not necessarily as great for non-local
Macs discovery, so I still think you have

00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:40.970
to create a process. And when your conversion
starts decelerating on your process for local

00:51:40.970 --> 00:51:45.410
Macs optimization, that's the time to then
jump to a non intuitive leap for a new feature,

00:51:45.410 --> 00:51:46.890
and potentially a new business model.

00:51:46.890 --> 00:51:47.890
&gt;&gt;Don: OK, next question

00:51:47.890 --> 00:51:53.680
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 7: For small and medium businesses,
is the lack of advertising, in your opinion,

00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:59.760
enough of a feature to get money out of them?
And where does advertising in freemium play?

00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:02.070
&gt;&gt;Don: Hi Bob, good to see you.

00:52:02.070 --> 00:52:06.599
&gt;&gt;Matt: I think it was addressed earlier in
the sense that you have to think that you

00:52:06.599 --> 00:52:12.010
have scale. I think the only real free medium
models which are working with advertising

00:52:12.010 --> 00:52:16.980
right now and business applications, are Google
Apps, which is working well in a mixed mode

00:52:16.980 --> 00:52:19.550
of subscription and advertising, and LinkedIn
as described, and they have scale of 7 to

00:52:19.550 --> 00:52:26.680
a 100 million users. Cos advertisers don't
really care for some of the volumes that people

00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:30.210
start to see. But if you're starting to think
about, how can you get leverage in these things

00:52:30.210 --> 00:52:34.810
early, because it can take a while for virility
to happen. I will encourage you to think hard

00:52:34.810 --> 00:52:36.400
about the Google market place and Google App
integration. Because companies like BatchBlue

00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:42.460
are growing their customer base by 100% more
than they were doing before, and their retention

00:52:42.460 --> 00:52:50.760
rates will be a lot higher, or Manymoon as
you might have just heard. So you can do this

00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:55.290
by your own and run for a long time on your
own or you can stand on the shoulders of giants

00:52:55.290 --> 00:52:59.630
like Google and others and really leverage
a freemium base globally to get your business

00:52:59.630 --> 00:53:00.630
cranking.

00:53:00.630 --> 00:53:05.050
&gt;&gt;Brad: I also think a very small percentage
of people would pay to not have ads. And if

00:53:05.050 --> 00:53:08.310
your ads are so offensive that they will pay
to not have ads, they're not going to use

00:53:08.310 --> 00:53:11.760
your service. So you have sort of a really
tough balance right there.

00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:12.760
&gt;&gt;Don: Next question?

00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:17.240
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 5: If your application is
targeting high net worth individuals for example

00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:22.590
or a client base that has a lot of money,
is it wise to just try to, you know, I know

00:53:22.590 --> 00:53:27.660
you mentioned earlier it's best to raise prices
rather than try to lower them, but like at

00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:32.410
what point do you like you know, hey this
is actually a good price and value for my

00:53:32.410 --> 00:53:35.670
clients but clear up here is where they pay.
I mean how far do push that bar?

00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:38.200
&gt;&gt;Dave / Don: [in unison] As far as you can
before they stop paying.

00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:39.200
[audience laughter]

00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:40.200
&gt;&gt;Don: As far as you can

00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:44.109
&gt;&gt;Dave: So that math should be relative to
competitively available alternatives, so if

00:53:44.109 --> 00:53:49.270
there's no competitively available alternatives,
charge through the fucking nose. Um, [laughs]

00:53:49.270 --> 00:53:52.320
and by the way don't worry about making it
perfect before you launch either. If there’s

00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:55.640
lots of competitive alternatives you have
to do the math of available pricing, whether

00:53:55.640 --> 00:53:57.660
the audience is aware of those other alternatives,
etc.

00:53:57.660 --> 00:53:59.300
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 5: Cool, thanks guys.

00:53:59.300 --> 00:54:00.300
&gt;&gt;Don: Next.

00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:03.320
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 6: [Latin American Accent]
Yeah. Um, the applications we're developing

00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:08.340
we want to try out in the Latin American market
and that tends to be all complicated because

00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:12.850
it has some new challenges, it poses some
new challenges. People are not as used to

00:54:12.850 --> 00:54:17.130
other current payments as you guys are up
here. So the conversion rates may be a little

00:54:17.130 --> 00:54:20.590
lower. But also we have a problem with lack
of Bankerization, I don't know if that is

00:54:20.590 --> 00:54:25.510
the appropriate word but not as many people
have actual credit cards that they can use

00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:29.590
in the United States. For example the Venezuelan
users they have currency control, they cannot

00:54:29.590 --> 00:54:34.430
use a credit card up here. So you have to
look into alternate methods of payments like

00:54:34.430 --> 00:54:40.710
for example SMS Micro payments and what not.
What has been your experience in using Freemium

00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:46.350
models for them? Is it better to try and force
some kind of monthly payment for them or go

00:54:46.350 --> 00:54:51.140
and use a sort of virtual currency method
where you buy credits and you use your credits

00:54:51.140 --> 00:54:55.400
as you go. I know we've touched on Pay as
you go method, but we have new challenges

00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:56.400
here.

00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:59.983
&gt;&gt;Jeff: So you want to try and shoot for frictionless
payment. So if there is a ton of friction

00:54:59.983 --> 00:55:05.660
in you patch of , you know geography, I think
that the credit model can work because you

00:55:05.660 --> 00:55:10.790
can just load up once your credit and then
consume them. The good news is that you can

00:55:10.790 --> 00:55:17.770
therefore disconnect the act of payment and
the act of consumption. But you know, we're

00:55:17.770 --> 00:55:18.770
used to have people who can bank, so we're
sort of less used to those kinds of models.

00:55:18.770 --> 00:55:19.770
&gt;&gt;Matt: Billing and management of subscriptions
is an enormous business opportunity and problem

00:55:19.770 --> 00:55:25.960
for you in this mode. And internationally
in particular, in some cases people are substituting

00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:33.490
labor for the payment and it's fine because
it'll tell people who may have the ability

00:55:33.490 --> 00:55:41.210
to pay so I wouldn’t be as concerned about
that. Google payments, as they've just announced

00:55:41.210 --> 00:55:45.401
will be part of both Marketplace and how and
where you can get paid from your own customers.

00:55:45.401 --> 00:55:50.020
And other suggestions for you, I mean PayPal
now has operations in, you know, hundreds

00:55:50.020 --> 00:55:55.470
of countries around the world, and has an
active mechanism for, you know, freemium companies

00:55:55.470 --> 00:56:00.600
to get paid as well as some of the other gateways.
But this, the both the getting paid and then

00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:04.490
the management of the subscriptions is harder
than you might think, and again, you know,

00:56:04.490 --> 00:56:07.520
without being paralysis to prevent you from
starting, you wanna put some time and thinking

00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:09.310
into this early and there are some vendors
who are focused on that.

00:56:09.310 --> 00:56:14.460
&gt;&gt;Dave:: And not missing the opportunity to
pimp a portfolio company, Recurly might be

00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:19.500
a great option for you to check out, others
are Chargify, ah probably not Zuora unless

00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:21.940
you want long contract fees and expensive
implementation.

00:56:21.940 --> 00:56:23.340
&gt;&gt;Don: OK, last question.

00:56:23.340 --> 00:56:29.380
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 7: Yeah you discussed briefly
about quota, about having a bus, having you

00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:34.180
know your base package it's free, everyone
loves using it. But creating that quota of

00:56:34.180 --> 00:56:39.170
well you can store 5 megabytes worth of documents
an hour, but you pay to get more space. In

00:56:39.170 --> 00:56:45.349
your experience how is that, has that been
a viable business model? Paying for space,

00:56:45.349 --> 00:56:52.020
coz as you said, bits are free. How likely
is a user in the end to pay to get more space

00:56:52.020 --> 00:56:57.573
to store stuff? Does it just depend on what
the base product is?

00:56:57.573 --> 00:57:01.720
&gt;&gt;Dave: So here's the other weird thing is
that Free is anything that you wouldn't take

00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:06.290
the time to unsubscribe for. So actually I
think there are a lot of models that are free

00:57:06.290 --> 00:57:11.750
really feels like less than $20 a month. I'd
be cautious about sort of annoying people

00:57:11.750 --> 00:57:18.810
to like the end of their means, but, so Dropbox
is an example, there are a lots of other alternatives

00:57:18.810 --> 00:57:23.160
for paying for stuff. I don't know why like
you know, certain people wanna pay $20 a month

00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:27.849
for Dropbox other than the fact that $20 a
month to a lot of people doesn't feel like

00:57:27.849 --> 00:57:32.130
a lot of money. So what you're really going
after there is, here's something useful and

00:57:32.130 --> 00:57:35.579
here's something close to being free enough
that I don't care about it.

00:57:35.579 --> 00:57:40.731
&gt;&gt;Brad: I think the key to having that dynamic
work though is that the product has to be

00:57:40.731 --> 00:57:46.950
awesome. It has to delight. It has to be something
that doesn't cause you to go look for an alternative

00:57:46.950 --> 00:57:50.840
that costs less than $20 a month. Because
you instinctively know they're out there but

00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:54.740
you're so delighted with this product that
you're willing to keep paying for it. Right?

00:57:54.740 --> 00:58:00.030
So, I think that's, that's part of the challenge.
It's interesting, there's a lot of free things

00:58:00.030 --> 00:58:06.349
that could disintermediate for example your
cable TV system, and there, they just aren't

00:58:06.349 --> 00:58:11.330
worth it yet, because they don't delight enough,
they're too hard. I don’t want my wife to

00:58:11.330 --> 00:58:18.089
call me, like she did and say I can't get
this to work. And so I'm willing to pay something

00:58:18.089 --> 00:58:22.150
until that point. You can scale that across
the whole thing. So just really focus on your

00:58:22.150 --> 00:58:24.730
product on delighting in that context.

00:58:24.730 --> 00:58:30.420
&gt;&gt;Jeff: Yeah and I think um, keeping in mind
that if you're in the enterprise you know,

00:58:30.420 --> 00:58:36.130
if your bill owed $10, sort of mark you can
expense it using your credit card as personal

00:58:36.130 --> 00:58:39.920
individual users you know, 3 bucks or 5 bucks
of month is just not that much money for a

00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:45.930
delightful experience. So yes, in the case
of Dropbox if I need it I will pay for it.

00:58:45.930 --> 00:58:53.560
And I won't wait until I'm sort of at the
threshold, I would just pay because I'm really

00:58:53.560 --> 00:58:56.060
happy and I won't bother searching out something
else. And so I think its really the user experience

00:58:56.060 --> 00:59:00.330
that you are driving for and then you figure
out what is the right hurdle that will sort

00:59:00.330 --> 00:59:06.730
of get, you know this notion of demand curve
you will, you will try to find, where it's

00:59:06.730 --> 00:59:10.400
optimal to get people to pay for X amount
at X capacity.

00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:12.490
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 7: Okay. thank You.

00:59:12.490 --> 00:59:18.329
&gt;&gt;Don: A reminder, if you're an entrepreneur
or a startup and you'd like to attend the

00:59:18.329 --> 00:59:24.140
Google reception tonight, you need one of
these cards see David Crane over here, or

00:59:24.140 --> 00:59:27.952
Joe Kraus or myself and we'll get you hooked
up. Thank you all for coming here and join

00:59:27.952 --> 00:59:31.210
me in thanking my panel.

00:59:31.210 --> 00:59:32.280
[Applause]
