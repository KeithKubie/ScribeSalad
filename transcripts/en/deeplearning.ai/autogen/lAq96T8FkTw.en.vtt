something called exponentially weighted

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:10.580
something called exponentially weighted
 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.100

let's first talk about that and it will

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430
let's first talk about that and it will
 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.040
let's first talk about that and it will
use this to build out two most

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050
use this to build out two most
 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.679
use this to build out two most
sophisticated optimization algorithms so

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689
sophisticated optimization algorithms so
 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.300
sophisticated optimization algorithms so
even though I now live in the United

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310
even though I now live in the United
 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.910
even though I now live in the United
States I was born in London so for this

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920
States I was born in London so for this
 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.240
States I was born in London so for this
example I got the daily temperature from

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250
example I got the daily temperature from
 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.450
example I got the daily temperature from
London from last year so on January 1st

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460
London from last year so on January 1st
 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.299
London from last year so on January 1st
temperature was 40 degrees Fahrenheit

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309
temperature was 40 degrees Fahrenheit
 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:37.190
temperature was 40 degrees Fahrenheit
and I know most the world uses a Celsius

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200
and I know most the world uses a Celsius
 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.260
and I know most the world uses a Celsius
system but I guess Olivia United States

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270
system but I guess Olivia United States
 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.600
system but I guess Olivia United States
which uses Fahrenheit so that's four

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610
which uses Fahrenheit so that's four
 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.250
which uses Fahrenheit so that's four
degrees Celsius and on January second it

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260
degrees Celsius and on January second it
 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.350
degrees Celsius and on January second it
was 90 degrees Celsius and so on and

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360
was 90 degrees Celsius and so on and
 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.150
was 90 degrees Celsius and so on and
then about halfway through the year a

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160
then about halfway through the year a
 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.279
then about halfway through the year a
year has 365 days so this would be

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289
year has 365 days so this would be
 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.619
year has 365 days so this would be
sometimes day number 118 would be

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629
sometimes day number 118 would be
 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.260
sometimes day number 118 would be
sometime in late May I guess 160 degrees

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270
sometime in late May I guess 160 degrees
 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.360
sometime in late May I guess 160 degrees
Fahrenheit which is 15 degrees Celsius

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370
Fahrenheit which is 15 degrees Celsius
 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.750
Fahrenheit which is 15 degrees Celsius
and so on so start to get near warmer to

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760
and so on so start to get near warmer to
 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.969
and so on so start to get near warmer to
one summer and it was colder in January

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979
one summer and it was colder in January
 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.340
one summer and it was colder in January
so you plot the data you end up with

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350
so you plot the data you end up with
 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.000
so you plot the data you end up with
this with day one being sometime in

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010
this with day one being sometime in
 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.649
this with day one being sometime in
January that you know being the

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659
January that you know being the
 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.480
January that you know being the
beginning of summer and that's the end

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490
beginning of summer and that's the end
 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.660
beginning of summer and that's the end
of the year kind of late December so

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670
of the year kind of late December so
 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.120
of the year kind of late December so
this would be January of January first

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130
this would be January of January first
 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.469
this would be January of January first
as you middle the Year approaching

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479
as you middle the Year approaching
 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.179
as you middle the Year approaching
summer and this would be the data from

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189
summer and this would be the data from
 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.640
summer and this would be the data from
the end of the year so this need to look

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650
the end of the year so this need to look
 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.590
the end of the year so this need to look
a little bit noisy and if you want to

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600
a little bit noisy and if you want to
 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.520
a little bit noisy and if you want to
compute the trends kind of the local

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530
compute the trends kind of the local
 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.399
compute the trends kind of the local
average or a moving average of the

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409
average or a moving average of the
 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.179
average or a moving average of the
temperature here's what you can do let's

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189
temperature here's what you can do let's
 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.020
temperature here's what you can do let's
initialize V zero equals zero and then

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030
initialize V zero equals zero and then
 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.749
initialize V zero equals zero and then
on every day we're going to average it

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759
on every day we're going to average it
 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.170
on every day we're going to average it
with a weight of 0.9 times whatever is

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180
with a weight of 0.9 times whatever is
 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.370
with a weight of 0.9 times whatever is
the previous value plus 0.1 times the

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380
the previous value plus 0.1 times the
 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.590
the previous value plus 0.1 times the
that day's temperature so theta one here

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600
that day's temperature so theta one here
 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.389
that day's temperature so theta one here
would be the temperature from this first

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399
would be the temperature from this first
 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.700
would be the temperature from this first
day and on a second day we're again

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710
day and on a second day we're again
 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.010
day and on a second day we're again
going to take a weighted average

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020
going to take a weighted average
 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.130
going to take a weighted average
so 0.9 times of the previous value plus

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140
so 0.9 times of the previous value plus
 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.480
so 0.9 times of the previous value plus
0.1 times today's temperature

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490
0.1 times today's temperature
 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.070
0.1 times today's temperature
so on v2 plus 0.1 times theta 3 and so

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080
so on v2 plus 0.1 times theta 3 and so
 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.520
so on v2 plus 0.1 times theta 3 and so
on and the more general formula is V on

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530
on and the more general formula is V on
 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.970
on and the more general formula is V on
a given day is 0.9 times V from the

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980
a given day is 0.9 times V from the
 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.809
a given day is 0.9 times V from the
previous day plus 0.1 times the

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819
previous day plus 0.1 times the
 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.020
previous day plus 0.1 times the
temperature of that day so if you

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030
temperature of that day so if you
 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.660
temperature of that day so if you
compute this and plot it in red this is

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670
compute this and plot it in red this is
 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.870
compute this and plot it in red this is
what you get you get a moving average or

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880
what you get you get a moving average or
 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.610
what you get you get a moving average or
what's called an exponentially weighted

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620
what's called an exponentially weighted
 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.699
what's called an exponentially weighted
average of the daily temperature so

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709
average of the daily temperature so
 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.500
average of the daily temperature so
let's look at the equation we had from

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510
let's look at the equation we had from
 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.479
let's look at the equation we had from
the previous slide it was VT equals

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489
the previous slide it was VT equals
 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.130
the previous slide it was VT equals
previously we had 0.9 do not turn that

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140
previously we had 0.9 do not turn that
 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.240
previously we had 0.9 do not turn that
into parameter beta beta times BT minus

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250
into parameter beta beta times BT minus
 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.630
into parameter beta beta times BT minus
1 plus and appreci with 0.1 then turn

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640
1 plus and appreci with 0.1 then turn
 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.860
1 plus and appreci with 0.1 then turn
that into 1 minus beta times theta T so

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870
that into 1 minus beta times theta T so
 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.190
that into 1 minus beta times theta T so
previously we had beta equals 0.9 it

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200
previously we had beta equals 0.9 it
 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.440
previously we had beta equals 0.9 it
turns out that for reasons we'll go into

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450
turns out that for reasons we'll go into
 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.990
turns out that for reasons we'll go into
later when you compute this you can

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000
later when you compute this you can
 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.710
later when you compute this you can
think of VT as approximately averaging

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720
think of VT as approximately averaging
 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.819
think of VT as approximately averaging
over something like 1 over 1 minus beta

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829
over something like 1 over 1 minus beta
 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:24.610
over something like 1 over 1 minus beta
days temperature so for example when

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620
days temperature so for example when
 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.979
days temperature so for example when
beta equals 0.9 you could think of this

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989
beta equals 0.9 you could think of this
 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:30.190
beta equals 0.9 you could think of this
as averaging over the last 10 days

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200
as averaging over the last 10 days
 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.140
as averaging over the last 10 days
temperature and that was the red line

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150
temperature and that was the red line
 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.449
temperature and that was the red line
now let's try something else let's say

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459
now let's try something else let's say
 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.110
now let's try something else let's say
it beta to be very close to 1 this is

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120
it beta to be very close to 1 this is
 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.090
it beta to be very close to 1 this is
0.98 then if you look at 1 over 1 minus

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100
0.98 then if you look at 1 over 1 minus
 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.819
0.98 then if you look at 1 over 1 minus
0.98 this is equal to 50 so this is zeal

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:48.829
0.98 this is equal to 50 so this is zeal
 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:50.860
0.98 this is equal to 50 so this is zeal
think of this is averaging over roughly

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870
think of this is averaging over roughly
 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.550
think of this is averaging over roughly
the last 50 days temperature and if you

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560
the last 50 days temperature and if you
 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.569
the last 50 days temperature and if you
plot that you get this green line so

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:58.579
plot that you get this green line so
 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:00.280
plot that you get this green line so
notice a couple things with this very

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290
notice a couple things with this very
 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.890
notice a couple things with this very
high value of beta the plot you get is

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900
high value of beta the plot you get is
 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.449
high value of beta the plot you get is
much smoother because you're now

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459
much smoother because you're now
 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.509
much smoother because you're now
averaging over more days of temperature

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519
averaging over more days of temperature
 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:08.949
averaging over more days of temperature
so the curve is just you know less

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959
so the curve is just you know less
 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:11.440
so the curve is just you know less
Wiggly is now smoother but on the flip

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450
Wiggly is now smoother but on the flip
 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.259
Wiggly is now smoother but on the flip
side the curve is now shifted further to

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:14.269
side the curve is now shifted further to
 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:15.849
side the curve is now shifted further to
the right because you're now averaging

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:15.859
the right because you're now averaging
 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:18.569
the right because you're now averaging
over a much larger window of temperature

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579
over a much larger window of temperature
 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.699
over a much larger window of temperature
and by averaging over a larger window

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709
and by averaging over a larger window
 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.830
and by averaging over a larger window
this formula is exponentially weighted

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840
this formula is exponentially weighted
 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.379
this formula is exponentially weighted
average formula it adapts more slowly

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:25.389
average formula it adapts more slowly
 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:28.050
average formula it adapts more slowly
when the temperature changes right so

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060
when the temperature changes right so
 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.700
when the temperature changes right so
there's just a little more latency and

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710
there's just a little more latency and
 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.089
there's just a little more latency and
the reason for that is when beta 0 0.98

00:04:33.089 --> 00:04:33.099
the reason for that is when beta 0 0.98
 

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:35.100
the reason for that is when beta 0 0.98
then it's giving a lot of weight to the

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110
then it's giving a lot of weight to the
 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.350
then it's giving a lot of weight to the
previous value and a much smaller weight

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360
previous value and a much smaller weight
 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.960
previous value and a much smaller weight
just point 0 to 2 whatever you're seeing

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970
just point 0 to 2 whatever you're seeing
 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.550
just point 0 to 2 whatever you're seeing
right now so when the temperature

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560
right now so when the temperature
 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.050
right now so when the temperature
changes or in term she goes up or down

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060
changes or in term she goes up or down
 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.170
changes or in term she goes up or down
this exponentially weighted average just

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180
this exponentially weighted average just
 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.450
this exponentially weighted average just
a decimal slowly when beta is so large

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460
a decimal slowly when beta is so large
 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.510
a decimal slowly when beta is so large
now let's try another value that you set

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520
now let's try another value that you set
 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.850
now let's try another value that you set
data to another extreme let's say it is

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860
data to another extreme let's say it is
 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.689
data to another extreme let's say it is
0.5 then this by the formula we have on

00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:57.699
0.5 then this by the formula we have on
 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:00.570
0.5 then this by the formula we have on
the right this is something like

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580
the right this is something like
 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.540
the right this is something like
averaging over just two days temperature

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550
averaging over just two days temperature
 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.850
averaging over just two days temperature
and you plot that to get this yellow

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860
and you plot that to get this yellow
 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.399
and you plot that to get this yellow
line and by averaging only over two days

00:05:08.399 --> 00:05:08.409
line and by averaging only over two days
 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:10.439
line and by averaging only over two days
temperature you have a muchness as if

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:10.449
temperature you have a muchness as if
 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:11.730
temperature you have a muchness as if
you're averaging over much shorter

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740
you're averaging over much shorter
 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.559
you're averaging over much shorter
window so you're much more noisy much

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:13.569
window so you're much more noisy much
 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:15.839
window so you're much more noisy much
more susceptible to outliers but this

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:15.849
more susceptible to outliers but this
 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:18.089
more susceptible to outliers but this
adapts much more quickly to the

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:18.099
adapts much more quickly to the
 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:21.480
adapts much more quickly to the
temperature changes so this formula is

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490
temperature changes so this formula is
 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.279
temperature changes so this formula is
