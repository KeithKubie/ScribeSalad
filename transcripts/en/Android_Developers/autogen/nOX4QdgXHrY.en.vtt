is turning the the world.the to its own

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
dictionary so imagine taking your phone
 

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:09.430 align:start position:0%

looking<00:11:07.190><c> around</c><00:11:07.279><c> and</c><00:11:07.970><c> we</c><00:11:08.660><c> feel</c><00:11:08.839><c> on</c><00:11:08.990><c> German</c>

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
looking around and we feel on German
 

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:10.810 align:start position:0%
looking around and we feel on German
then<00:11:09.740><c> you</c><00:11:09.860><c> look</c><00:11:10.010><c> at</c><00:11:10.160><c> the</c><00:11:10.220><c> screen</c><00:11:10.520><c> you</c><00:11:10.550><c> learn</c>

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:10.820 align:start position:0%
then you look at the screen you learn

how to say screen or TV in German and
there<00:11:14.360><c> was</c><00:11:14.480><c> the</c><00:11:14.600><c> idea</c><00:11:14.630><c> so</c><00:11:15.050><c> once</c><00:11:16.420><c> once</c><00:11:17.420><c> we</c><00:11:17.540><c> had</c>

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:17.810 align:start position:0%
there was the idea so once once we had
 

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:19.390 align:start position:0%
there was the idea so once once we had

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:19.400 align:start position:0%
that in place after the hack there was
 

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.160 align:start position:0%
that in place after the hack there was

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:21.170 align:start position:0%
thought okay this is really cool how can
 

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:23.170 align:start position:0%
thought okay this is really cool how can
we<00:11:21.320><c> take</c><00:11:21.560><c> this</c><00:11:21.709><c> and</c><00:11:21.980><c> actually</c><00:11:22.130><c> make</c><00:11:22.579><c> this</c>

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:23.180 align:start position:0%
we take this and actually make this
 

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:24.790 align:start position:0%
we take this and actually make this
something<00:11:23.450><c> that</c><00:11:23.570><c> we</c><00:11:23.690><c> can</c><00:11:23.870><c> give</c><00:11:24.079><c> to</c><00:11:24.110><c> our</c><00:11:24.320><c> users</c>

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
something that we can give to our users
 

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:28.420 align:start position:0%
something that we can give to our users
so<00:11:25.550><c> don't</c><00:11:25.730><c> we</c><00:11:25.790><c> we</c><00:11:25.970><c> started</c><00:11:26.300><c> kind</c><00:11:26.600><c> of</c><00:11:27.430><c> looking</c>

very much fun but I think that's not the
 

00:12:27.209 --> 00:12:29.059 align:start position:0%
very much fun but I think that's not the

first thing when we look at the picture
we<00:12:29.220><c> think</c><00:12:29.459><c> it</c><00:12:29.609><c> so</c><00:12:30.149><c> I</c><00:12:30.179><c> think</c><00:12:30.269><c> context</c><00:12:31.109><c> is</c><00:12:31.229><c> really</c>

00:12:31.549 --> 00:12:31.559 align:start position:0%
we think it so I think context is really
 

00:12:31.559 --> 00:12:33.079 align:start position:0%
we think it so I think context is really

00:12:33.079 --> 00:12:33.089 align:start position:0%

00:12:50.159 --> 00:12:52.519 align:start position:0%
actually decide to train our own model
so<00:12:50.699><c> we</c><00:12:50.879><c> used</c><00:12:51.029><c> the</c><00:12:51.720><c> based</c><00:12:51.869><c> on</c><00:12:51.959><c> was</c><00:12:52.139><c> using</c>

00:12:52.519 --> 00:12:52.529 align:start position:0%
so we used the based on was using
 

00:12:52.529 --> 00:12:54.109 align:start position:0%
so we used the based on was using

exists on on top of that we trained our

00:14:58.889 --> 00:14:58.899 align:start position:0%
good model different data sets really
 

00:14:58.899 --> 00:15:01.379 align:start position:0%
good model different data sets really
equal<00:14:59.259><c> different</c><00:14:59.920><c> products</c><00:15:00.610><c> so</c><00:15:00.819><c> like</c><00:15:01.119><c> you</c><00:15:01.240><c> see</c>

00:15:01.379 --> 00:15:01.389 align:start position:0%
equal different products so like you see
 

00:15:01.389 --> 00:15:03.809 align:start position:0%
