00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:06.160
At the Grind House, Honduran
coffee sells for $8 per pound,

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.860
and Costa Rican coffee sells
for $11.50 per pound.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.390
If 1 pound of Central American
Blend coffee contains 0.4

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.570
pounds of Costa Rican-- so I did
Costa Rican in this orange

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.360
color before, so I'll do it
again-- so it contains 0.4

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.650
pounds of Costa Rican coffee
and 0.6 pounds of Honduran

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.670
coffee-- I'll do the Honduran
coffee in blue.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.750
That was our original--
that first statement.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.570
How much should 1
pound sell for?

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.680
So they're really just saying,
well, how much does it cost

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.480
for me to buy 0.4 pounds
of Costa Rican and

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.990
0.6 pounds of Honduran?

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.490
And if I take that total, that's
how much it's going to

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.350
cost me to get 1 pound of my
Central American Blend.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:48.750
So let's just figure that out.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.010
The Costa Rican coffee-- I'll
write it here-- Costa Rican

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.690
coffee-- we're going to--
it's $8 per pound.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.720
Oh no, sorry, it's
$11.50 per pound.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.700
We have to be very careful.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:06.630
The Costa Rican coffee
is $11.50 per pound.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.970
We can write it like
this, per pound.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.820
And then we're going to multiply
that times the number

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.650
of pounds we want of the Costa
Rican coffee in our blend.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.020
And we have 0.4 pounds of it.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.950
So times 0.4 pounds.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.760
The pounds cancel out, and
you have 0.4 times 11.50.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:32.090
4 times 11.50 would be 44 plus
2, which would be 46, so 0.4

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.500
is going to be 4.6.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.390
So this is equal to $4.60.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.630
Now, we'll do the same thing
for the Honduran coffee.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.870
We're going to get 0.6 pounds.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.200
Well, first, let's put
the price here.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.930
It's $8 per pound.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.750
So it is $8 per pound.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.530
And multiply it times the
number of pounds.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.130
We need 0.6 pounds of it.

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:09.550
And 8 times 6 is 48, so
8 times 0.6 is $4.80.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.950
So this is equal to $4.80.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.410
So that's how much we're going
to have to spend on Costa

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:16.920
Rican, that's how much we're
going to have to spend on

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:17.700
Honduran coffee.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.510
If we add them up, that's how
much a pound of the Central

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.980
American Blend is going to cost.
Because we're getting--

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.710
if you add up the pounds, you
get a pound here, so the total

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.740
cost is the total cost of
a pound of the blend.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.410
Let's put it right here.

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:31.540
0 plus 0 is 0.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.700
6 plus 8 is 14.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.810
1 plus 4 plus 4 is 9.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.050
Put the decimal in
the right place.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:44.390
It's going to cost us a total
of $9.40 for the blend.
