00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.692
So the topic for today is we
have a system like the kind we

00:00:14.692 --> 00:00:20.346
have been studying,
but there is now a difference.

00:00:20.346 --> 00:00:25.653
A system of first order
differential equations,

00:00:25.653 --> 00:00:30.615
just two of them.
It is an autonomous system

00:00:30.615 --> 00:00:36.153
meaning, of course,
that there is no t explicitly

00:00:36.153 --> 00:00:42.269
on the right-hand side.
But what makes this different,

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:47.000
now, is that it is nonlinear.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.112
In other words,
the functions on the right-hand

00:00:59.112 --> 00:01:03.172
side are no longer simple things
like ax plus by,

00:01:03.172 --> 00:01:07.460
cx plus dy.
Those are the kind we have been

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.555
studying.
But we are going to allow them

00:01:10.555 --> 00:01:13.650
to have quadratic terms,
sines, cosines,

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.333
different stuff there that are
not linear functions anymore.

00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:21.984
And the problem is,
if it's a linear system you

00:01:21.984 --> 00:01:26.825
know how to get a sketch of its
trajectories without using the

00:01:26.825 --> 00:01:33.222
computer by using eigenlines.
You were very good at that on

00:01:33.222 --> 00:01:38.666
the exam on Friday.
Most of you could do that very

00:01:38.666 --> 00:01:42.555
well.
But what do you do if you have

00:01:42.555 --> 00:01:47.777
a nonlinear system?
The problem is to sketch its

00:01:47.777 --> 00:01:50.000
trajectories.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.416
In general, there are not
analytic formulas for the

00:02:03.416 --> 00:02:06.150
solutions to nonlinear systems
like that.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.610
There are only computer-drawn
things.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.232
But sometimes you have to get
qualitative information,

00:02:12.232 --> 00:02:15.034
a quick idea of how the
trajectories look.

00:02:15.034 --> 00:02:18.656
And, especially on Friday,
I will give you examples of

00:02:18.656 --> 00:02:22.824
stuff that you can do that the
computer cannot do very well at

00:02:22.824 --> 00:02:24.874
all.
Okay, so the problem is to

00:02:24.874 --> 00:02:28.633
sketch those trajectories.
Now, what I am going to do is

00:02:28.633 --> 00:02:33.061
--
The way I will give the lecture

00:02:33.061 --> 00:02:39.086
is, this is the general problem.
We have to do two things sort

00:02:39.086 --> 00:02:42.938
of simultaneously.
I will give a general

00:02:42.938 --> 00:02:48.567
explanation using x and y,
but then, as we do each step of

00:02:48.567 --> 00:02:54.691
the process and talk about it in
general, I would like to carry

00:02:54.691 --> 00:03:00.222
it out on a specific example.
And so we will do it with a

00:03:00.222 --> 00:03:04.962
specific example.
The example I am going to carry

00:03:04.962 --> 00:03:10.000
out is that of the nonlinear
pendulum.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.892
I am using this because it
illustrates virtually

00:03:13.892 --> 00:03:16.211
everything.
And, in addition,

00:03:16.211 --> 00:03:20.435
it has the great advantage
that, since we know how a

00:03:20.435 --> 00:03:23.334
pendulum swings,
we will be able to,

00:03:23.334 --> 00:03:26.398
when we get the answer,
verify it and,

00:03:26.398 --> 00:03:30.539
at various stages of the
procedure, verify that the

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:34.266
mathematics is,
in fact, in agreement with our

00:03:34.266 --> 00:03:39.076
physical intuition.
It is going to be a lightly

00:03:39.076 --> 00:03:43.615
damped pendulum because I am
going to have to put in numbers

00:03:43.615 --> 00:03:48.461
in order to do the calculations.
And that seems like a good case

00:03:48.461 --> 00:03:51.769
which illustrates several types
of behavior.

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:55.230
Let's first of all,
before we talk in general,

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.894
remind you of the pendulum.
The pendulum I am talking about

00:04:00.894 --> 00:04:04.162
has the vertex from which it
swings.

00:04:04.162 --> 00:04:08.084
This is a rigid rod.
It is not one of these

00:04:08.084 --> 00:04:12.099
string-type pendulums.
There is a mass here.

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:17.608
The rigid rod is of length l.
And so it swings in a circular

00:04:17.608 --> 00:04:21.530
orbit like that back and forth
in a circle.

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:27.132
And let's put in the vertical
distance, the vertical position

00:04:27.132 --> 00:04:30.766
rather.
And now, as variables,

00:04:30.766 --> 00:04:35.262
of course normally we use
neutral variables like x and y.

00:04:35.262 --> 00:04:39.759
But here x and y are not
relevant variables to describing

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:44.094
the way the mass moves.
The obviously relevant variable

00:04:44.094 --> 00:04:47.868
is theta, this angle.
Now, I am taking it in the

00:04:47.868 --> 00:04:50.919
positive direction.
Here theta is zero.

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:53.810
As it swings,
theta becomes positive.

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.985
Over here, when it is
horizontal, theta has the value

00:04:57.985 --> 00:05:02.000
pi over two and then so on it
goes.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.142
Values here correspond to
negative values of theta.

00:05:06.142 --> 00:05:10.449
That is how it swings.
Now, just to remind you of the

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:15.337
equation that this satisfies,
it satisfies F equals ma,

00:05:15.337 --> 00:05:19.893
rather ma equals F.
Now, the acceleration is along

00:05:19.893 --> 00:05:23.869
the circular path.
And that is different from the

00:05:23.869 --> 00:05:28.094
angular acceleration.
I have to put in the factor of

00:05:28.094 --> 00:05:32.755
the length.
You had that a lot in 8.01 so I

00:05:32.755 --> 00:05:35.600
am simply going to write it
down.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.800
It is the mass.
Therefore, the linear

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:44.044
acceleration along the circular
path is equal to the angular

00:05:44.044 --> 00:05:48.133
acceleration times l.
It is l times theta prime

00:05:48.133 --> 00:05:51.155
prime, or double dot if you
prefer.

00:05:51.155 --> 00:05:55.511
And so this much of it is the
acceleration vector.

00:05:55.511 --> 00:06:00.933
Now, once the force is acting
on it, well, there is a force of

00:06:00.933 --> 00:06:06.000
gravity which is pulling it
straight down.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.757
But, of course,
that is not the relevant force.

00:06:09.757 --> 00:06:14.414
I am interested in the force
that acts along that circular

00:06:14.414 --> 00:06:17.354
line.
And that will not be all of the

00:06:17.354 --> 00:06:21.439
pink line but only its component
in that direction.

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:25.115
And the component,
I fill out the little right

00:06:25.115 --> 00:06:28.056
triangle.
And then the way to get the

00:06:28.056 --> 00:06:32.794
component in that direction,
the vertical pink part has the

00:06:32.794 --> 00:06:36.709
magnitude mg.
But, since I only want this

00:06:36.709 --> 00:06:39.875
part, I have to multiply by the
sign of this angle.

00:06:39.875 --> 00:06:43.611
Now, sometimes I have given on
a diagnostic test to students

00:06:43.611 --> 00:06:45.954
when they enter to what angle is
that?

00:06:45.954 --> 00:06:48.676
But, of course,
anybody can guess it must be

00:06:48.676 --> 00:06:50.703
theta.
Otherwise, why would he be

00:06:50.703 --> 00:06:52.982
asking it?
So this is still the angle

00:06:52.982 --> 00:06:54.818
theta.
You can prove these two

00:06:54.818 --> 00:06:57.858
triangles are similar.
One of them I haven't even

00:06:57.858 --> 00:07:01.530
written in, but it would be the
right triangle whose leg is

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:06.480
perpendicular to it.
So the right angle is here.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:11.533
If that is theta then the
length of this small pink line

00:07:11.533 --> 00:07:15.851
is mg times the sine of theta.

00:07:15.851 --> 00:07:20.445
That is the force due gravity.
It is mg sine theta.

00:07:20.445 --> 00:07:25.865
Except in what direction is it?
It is acting in the negative

00:07:25.865 --> 00:07:30.000
direction.
This is theta increasing.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.335
This is the opposite direction,
so I should put a negative sign

00:07:35.335 --> 00:07:39.293
in front of it.
But that is not the only force.

00:07:39.293 --> 00:07:44.026
There is also a damping force
that goes with a velocity.

00:07:44.026 --> 00:07:48.845
And that also occurs if the
angular velocity is positive,

00:07:48.845 --> 00:07:52.718
the angle theta is increasing,
in other words,

00:07:52.718 --> 00:07:59.000
the damping force resists that.
It is opposite to the velocity.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.514
So the velocity is going to be
l times theta prime.

00:08:02.514 --> 00:08:05.256
There is my velocity v.
Linear velocity,

00:08:05.256 --> 00:08:08.700
not angular velocity.
And so this is going to be a

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:11.653
negative times some constant
times that c1.

00:08:11.653 --> 00:08:15.659
Now, that is the equation.
But let's make it look a little

00:08:15.659 --> 00:08:19.034
better by getting rid of some of
these constants.

00:08:19.034 --> 00:08:23.321
If I write it out this way and
put everything on the left-hand

00:08:23.321 --> 00:08:27.328
side, the way it is usually done
in writing a second order

00:08:27.328 --> 00:08:32.060
differential equation.
Theta I am going to divide

00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:37.132
through by ml and put everything
on the left-hand side and in the

00:08:37.132 --> 00:08:40.144
right order.
Next should come the theta

00:08:40.144 --> 00:08:43.393
prime term.
And so that is going to be c1l

00:08:43.393 --> 00:08:46.167
divided by ml,
so that is c1 over m.

00:08:46.167 --> 00:08:48.703
The l's cancel out.
And, finally,

00:08:48.703 --> 00:08:53.062
the last term on the right,
I will move this over to the

00:08:53.062 --> 00:08:57.184
left, but remember everything is
being divided by ml,

00:08:57.184 --> 00:09:01.226
so the m's cancel out,
and it is plus g over l times

00:09:01.226 --> 00:09:05.851
the sine of theta.
That is our differential

00:09:05.851 --> 00:09:08.859
equation.
But let's make it look still a

00:09:08.859 --> 00:09:13.409
little bit better by lumping
these constants and giving them

00:09:13.409 --> 00:09:16.571
new names.
It is going to be finally theta

00:09:16.571 --> 00:09:19.811
double prime.
I will simply call this thing

00:09:19.811 --> 00:09:23.744
the damping constant.
I will lump those two together

00:09:23.744 --> 00:09:27.369
into single damping constant.
And then g over l,

00:09:27.369 --> 00:09:29.760
I will lump those together,
too.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:34.696
And we usually call that k.
It is k sine theta.

00:09:34.696 --> 00:09:37.780
Now, this is a second-order

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:40.865
different equation,
but it is not linear.

00:09:40.865 --> 00:09:45.260
If this were a month and a half
ago and I said solve that,

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.881
you would stare at me.
But, anyway,

00:09:47.881 --> 00:09:50.889
you couldn't solve that.
And nobody can,

00:09:50.889 --> 00:09:54.050
in some sense.
It is a nonlinear equation.

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:56.672
It doesn't have any exact
solution.

00:09:56.672 --> 00:10:01.375
The only thing you could do is
look for a solution in infinite

00:10:01.375 --> 00:10:06.742
series or something like that.
Well, what do you do?

00:10:06.742 --> 00:10:11.141
You throw it on the computer,
that is the easy answer,

00:10:11.141 --> 00:10:15.705
but what does the computer do?
Well, the first thing the

00:10:15.705 --> 00:10:20.850
computer does is turns it into a
system because the computer is

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:25.000
going to use numerical methods
to solve it.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.299
But only those methods,
the formulas it uses,

00:10:28.299 --> 00:10:32.875
Euler or modified or improved
Euler or the Runge-Cutta method,

00:10:32.875 --> 00:10:36.774
they are always expressed not
for single higher-order

00:10:36.774 --> 00:10:41.125
equations, but instead they
always assume that the equation

00:10:41.125 --> 00:10:44.274
has been converted to a first
order system.

00:10:44.274 --> 00:10:48.475
Let's do that for the computer,
even though it will do it

00:10:48.475 --> 00:10:50.875
itself if nobody tells it not
to.

00:10:50.875 --> 00:10:54.850
Theta prime is equal to,
now I have to figure out what

00:10:54.850 --> 00:11:00.066
new variable to introduce.
Normally we use x prime and

00:11:00.066 --> 00:11:03.282
call that y.
That really doesn't seem to be

00:11:03.282 --> 00:11:07.110
very suitable here.
But what do the physicists call

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:09.559
it?
This is the angular velocity.

00:11:09.559 --> 00:11:13.081
And the standard designation
for that is omega.

00:11:13.081 --> 00:11:16.832
Two Greek letters.
I told you this was going to be

00:11:16.832 --> 00:11:19.052
hard.
Omega prime equals what?

00:11:19.052 --> 00:11:23.186
Well, omega prime equals,
now you do it in the standard

00:11:23.186 --> 00:11:27.473
way, you convert the system,
but remember you have to put

00:11:27.473 --> 00:11:32.256
the theta first.
So it is minus k sine theta.

00:11:32.256 --> 00:11:36.101
The theta first and then the

00:11:36.101 --> 00:11:39.444
omega term first.
So minus c times omega,

00:11:39.444 --> 00:11:42.704
minus c theta prime,
but theta prime is,

00:11:42.704 --> 00:11:44.292
in real life,
omega.

00:11:44.292 --> 00:11:47.385
And now we have our acceptable
system.

00:11:47.385 --> 00:11:51.814
The only problem is I have not
put in any numbers yet.

00:11:51.814 --> 00:11:58.000
The numbers I am going to put
in will make it lightly damped.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.739
I am going to give c,
think of it here,

00:12:00.739 --> 00:12:03.695
this is the damping,
and this is the stuff

00:12:03.695 --> 00:12:06.506
representing,
well, if I want to make it

00:12:06.506 --> 00:12:10.471
lightly damped all I am saying
is that c should be small

00:12:10.471 --> 00:12:13.787
compared with k,
but it doesn't have to be very

00:12:13.787 --> 00:12:16.382
small.
I am going to take c equal one

00:12:16.382 --> 00:12:20.491
and k equal two,
and that will make it

00:12:20.491 --> 00:12:23.951
lightly enough damped.
This is the lightly damped

00:12:23.951 --> 00:12:26.619
value, values which give
underdamping.

00:12:26.619 --> 00:12:29.646
In other words,
they are going to allow the

00:12:29.646 --> 00:12:34.260
pendulum to swing back and forth
instead of strictly going ug and

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:38.851
ending up there.
Finally, therefore,

00:12:38.851 --> 00:12:44.796
the system that we are going to
calculate is where theta prime

00:12:44.796 --> 00:12:50.449
equals omega and omega prime
equals negative two sine theta

00:12:50.449 --> 00:12:54.055
minus omega.

00:12:54.055 --> 00:12:57.076
And now what do we do with
that?

00:12:57.076 --> 00:13:01.744
There is our example.
That is our system that

00:13:01.744 --> 00:13:05.156
represents a pendulum swinging
back and forth,

00:13:05.156 --> 00:13:08.189
damped away.
And now let's go back to the

00:13:08.189 --> 00:13:10.540
general theory.
And, in general,

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:15.090
if you have a nonlinear system,

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:16.000
how do you go about analyzing
it?

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.133
The first step is to find the
simplest possible solutions,

00:13:27.133 --> 00:13:31.637
solutions that you hope can be
found by inspection.

00:13:31.637 --> 00:13:36.230
Now, what would they be?
They are the solutions that

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:40.824
consist of a single point.
How could a solution be a

00:13:40.824 --> 00:13:44.427
single point?
Well, like the origin for a

00:13:44.427 --> 00:13:47.759
linear system,
those points which form

00:13:47.759 --> 00:13:52.983
solutions all by themselves are
called the critical points.

00:13:52.983 --> 00:13:57.487
I am looking for the critical
points of the system.

00:13:57.487 --> 00:14:03.956
That is the first step.
The definition is a critical

00:14:03.956 --> 00:14:06.701
point x zero,
y zero.

00:14:06.701 --> 00:14:10.608
For that to be a critical point

00:14:10.608 --> 00:14:15.254
means that it makes the
right-hand side zero.

00:14:15.254 --> 00:14:19.900
The f is zero there,
and the g is zero there.

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:25.602
See the significance of that?
If you have such a point,

00:14:25.602 --> 00:14:31.515
let's say there is a critical
point, what is the velocity

00:14:31.515 --> 00:14:36.575
field at that point?
Well, it is given by the

00:14:36.575 --> 00:14:40.449
vectors on the right-hand side,
but the components are zero.

00:14:40.449 --> 00:14:43.929
That means, at this point the
velocity vector is zero.

00:14:43.929 --> 00:14:46.752
Well, that means if a solution
starts there,

00:14:46.752 --> 00:14:49.575
you put the mouse there and
tell it to move,

00:14:49.575 --> 00:14:52.661
where do you go?
It has no reason to go anywhere

00:14:52.661 --> 00:14:55.222
since the velocity vector is
zero there.

00:14:55.222 --> 00:14:58.767
So it sits there for all time.
And indeed it solves the

00:14:58.767 --> 00:15:03.375
system, doesn't it?
It makes the right-hand side

00:15:03.375 --> 00:15:08.381
zero and it makes the left-hand
side zero because x equals x

00:15:08.381 --> 00:15:12.284
zero, y equals y zero for

00:15:12.284 --> 00:15:15.678
all time.
If that is true for all time it

00:15:15.678 --> 00:15:20.939
sits there then the derivatives,
with respect to time are zero,

00:15:20.939 --> 00:15:25.690
so the left-hand sides are
zero, the right-hand sides are

00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:32.210
zero and everybody is happy.
Well, these are great points.

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:37.302
How do I find them?
Well, by looking for points

00:15:37.302 --> 00:15:41.066
that make these two functions
zero.

00:15:41.066 --> 00:15:46.822
I find them by solving
simultaneously the equations f

00:15:46.822 --> 00:15:52.911
of (x, y) equals zero and g of
(x, y) equals zero.

00:15:55.568 --> 00:16:01.057
A pair of equations.
But the trouble is those are

00:16:01.057 --> 00:16:04.732
not linear equations.
Linear equations you know how

00:16:04.732 --> 00:16:07.893
to solve, but they are not
linear equations.

00:16:07.893 --> 00:16:11.861
They are nonlinear equations
that you don't know how to

00:16:11.861 --> 00:16:13.772
solve.
And, to some extent,

00:16:13.772 --> 00:16:17.815
nobody else does either.
There are very fat books in the

00:16:17.815 --> 00:16:22.224
library whose topic is how to
solve just a pair of equations,

00:16:22.224 --> 00:16:25.752
f of (x, y) equals zero,
g of (x, y) equals zero.

00:16:25.752 --> 00:16:30.089
And it is quite a hard problem.
It is even a hard problem by

00:16:30.089 --> 00:16:33.418
computer.
Because, if you know

00:16:33.418 --> 00:16:36.752
approximately where the solution
is going to be,

00:16:36.752 --> 00:16:40.583
you can make up the little
screen and then the computer

00:16:40.583 --> 00:16:43.917
will find it for you.
Or, even without a screen,

00:16:43.917 --> 00:16:47.535
it will calculate it by
Newton's method or something

00:16:47.535 --> 00:16:50.160
else, it will zero in.
The problem is,

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:54.416
if you don't know in advance
roughly where the critical point

00:16:54.416 --> 00:16:58.318
is that you are looking for,
there are a lot of numbers.

00:16:58.318 --> 00:17:03.000
They go to infinity that way
and infinity that way.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.587
In general, it is almost an
impossible problem.

00:17:06.587 --> 00:17:11.189
The only thing that makes it
possible is that these problems

00:17:11.189 --> 00:17:15.557
always come from the real world
and one has some physical

00:17:15.557 --> 00:17:19.222
feeling, one hopes,
for where the critical point

00:17:19.222 --> 00:17:21.718
is.
I am going to assume breezily

00:17:21.718 --> 00:17:26.632
and cheerily we can solve those.
And I am only going to give you

00:17:26.632 --> 00:17:31.000
examples where it is possible to
solve them.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.501
But even there,
you have to watch out.

00:17:33.501 --> 00:17:37.624
There is a certain trickiness
that will be talked about in the

00:17:37.624 --> 00:17:41.072
recitations tomorrow.
Okay, so we found the critical

00:17:41.072 --> 00:17:43.438
points.
Let's do it for our example.

00:17:43.438 --> 00:17:47.426
Let's find the critical point.
What is the pair of equations

00:17:47.426 --> 00:17:50.603
we have to solve?
We have to solve the equations

00:17:50.603 --> 00:17:53.578
omega equals zero,
minus two sine theta minus

00:17:53.578 --> 00:17:56.755
omega equals zero.

00:17:56.755 --> 00:18:00.000
Now, it is not always this
easy.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.523
But the solution is omega is
zero.

00:18:03.523 --> 00:18:07.793
If omega is zero,
then sine theta is zero,

00:18:07.793 --> 00:18:12.918
and sine theta is zero at the

00:18:12.918 --> 00:18:18.683
integral multiples of pi.
The critical points are omega

00:18:18.683 --> 00:18:24.555
is always zero and theta is
zero, or it could be plus or

00:18:24.555 --> 00:18:30.000
minus pi, plus or minus two pi
and so on.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.573
In other words,
there are an infinity of

00:18:32.573 --> 00:18:34.883
critical points.
That seems a little

00:18:34.883 --> 00:18:36.928
discouraging.
On the other hand,

00:18:36.928 --> 00:18:40.426
there are really only two.
There are really physically

00:18:40.426 --> 00:18:44.055
only two because omega equals
zero means the mass is not

00:18:44.055 --> 00:18:46.431
moving.
The angular velocity is zero,

00:18:46.431 --> 00:18:49.730
so it is only the theta
position which is changing.

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:52.502
Now, what are the possible
theta positions?

00:18:52.502 --> 00:18:56.000
Well, here is our nonlinear
pendulum.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.776
Here is the critical point,
theta equals zero,

00:18:59.776 --> 00:19:03.888
omega equals zero.
Theta equals zero means the rod

00:19:03.888 --> 00:19:07.496
is vertical.
Omega equals zero means that it

00:19:07.496 --> 00:19:10.937
is not moving,
despite the fact that it is

00:19:10.937 --> 00:19:14.125
moving.
Theoretically it is not moving.

00:19:14.125 --> 00:19:18.993
Now, what is the other one?
Well, there is theta equals pi.

00:19:18.993 --> 00:19:21.930
Theta is now,
starting from zero and

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:25.454
increasing, I hope,
through positive theta.

00:19:25.454 --> 00:19:29.818
And when it gets to pi,
it is sticking straight up in

00:19:29.818 --> 00:19:34.245
the air.
And so the claim is that

00:19:34.245 --> 00:19:40.138
another critical point is theta
equals pi and omega equals zero.

00:19:40.138 --> 00:19:44.161
In other words,
if it gets to this position,

00:19:44.161 --> 00:19:49.680
it starts out in this position
and stays there for all time,

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:53.609
as you see.
[LAUGHTER] But my point is what

00:19:53.609 --> 00:19:57.445
about negative pi?
That is the same as pi.

00:19:57.445 --> 00:20:03.803
Two pi is the same as zero.
So physically there really are

00:20:03.803 --> 00:20:08.196
only two critical points,
this one and that one.

00:20:08.196 --> 00:20:13.149
And they obviously have
something very different about

00:20:13.149 --> 00:20:16.420
them.
This critical point is stable.

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:21.280
If I start near there,
I approach that critical point

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:25.205
in infinite time.
This one, if I start near

00:20:25.205 --> 00:20:31.000
there, I do not stay near there.
I always leave it.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:38.078
Of the two critical points,
physically it is clear that the

00:20:38.078 --> 00:20:44.303
critical point is zero,
zero and the other guys that

00:20:44.303 --> 00:20:49.062
look like it,
two pi zero and so on is a

00:20:49.062 --> 00:20:53.822
stable critical point.
Whereas, pi zero,

00:20:53.822 --> 00:20:59.314
when theta is sticking straight
up in the air,

00:20:59.314 --> 00:21:03.117
is unstable.
Now, of course,

00:21:03.117 --> 00:21:06.393
we will want to see that
mathematically also,

00:21:06.393 --> 00:21:10.042
but basically there are just
physically two point.

00:21:10.042 --> 00:21:12.574
There are just two critical
points.

00:21:12.574 --> 00:21:16.744
Well, that raises the question
what about all the others?

00:21:16.744 --> 00:21:19.574
As you will see,
we have to have those.

00:21:19.574 --> 00:21:22.627
They are an essential part of
the problem.

00:21:22.627 --> 00:21:26.946
They are not just redundant
baggage that is trailing along.

00:21:26.946 --> 00:21:33.452
They are really important.
But you will see that when we

00:21:33.452 --> 00:21:40.000
talk about finally how the
trajectories look and how the

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.928
solutions look.
Now what do we do?

00:21:43.928 --> 00:21:50.952
Well, we found the critical
points, and now the work begins.

00:21:50.952 --> 00:21:56.071
Virtually all the work is in
this next step.

00:21:56.071 --> 00:22:00.000
What do we do?
Step two.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.687
I can only describe it in
general terms,

00:22:05.687 --> 00:22:13.708
but here is what you do.
For each critical point x zero,

00:22:13.708 --> 00:22:21.145
y zero, a procedure that has to
be done at each one,

00:22:21.145 --> 00:22:28.000
you linearize the system near
that point.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.869
In other words,
you may find a linear system,

00:22:32.869 --> 00:22:37.075
the good kind,
the kind you know about,

00:22:37.075 --> 00:22:43.715
which is a good approximation
to the nonlinear system at that

00:22:43.715 --> 00:22:48.584
critical point.
Plot the trajectories of this

00:22:48.584 --> 00:22:53.233
linearized system.
And you do that near the

00:22:53.233 --> 00:22:56.000
critical point.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.989
How do you plot the
trajectories?

00:23:05.989 --> 00:23:09.658
Well, that you knew how to do
on Friday so I am assuming you

00:23:09.658 --> 00:23:11.709
still know how to do it on
Monday.

00:23:11.709 --> 00:23:14.321
In other words,
if the system is linear you

00:23:14.321 --> 00:23:16.870
know how to plot the
trajectories of it by

00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:20.165
calculating eigenvalues and
eigenvectors and maybe the

00:23:20.165 --> 00:23:22.466
direction of motion if it is a
spiral.

00:23:22.466 --> 00:23:25.948
I will give you a couple of
examples of that when we work

00:23:25.948 --> 00:23:29.635
out the pendulum.
But, on the other hand,

00:23:29.635 --> 00:23:33.688
how do I line arise a system?
Well, there are two methods.

00:23:33.688 --> 00:23:37.884
There is one method the book
gives you, which by and large I

00:23:37.884 --> 00:23:41.440
do not want you to use,
although I will give you an

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:44.497
example of it now.
I want you to use another

00:23:44.497 --> 00:23:46.773
method because it is much
faster.

00:23:46.773 --> 00:23:50.684
Especially if you have to
handle several critical points

00:23:50.684 --> 00:23:54.453
it is much, much faster.
Let's first carry this out on

00:23:54.453 --> 00:23:57.582
an easy case,
and then I will show you how to

00:23:57.582 --> 00:24:02.766
do it in general.
Just this once I will use the

00:24:02.766 --> 00:24:08.203
book's method because I think it
is the method which would

00:24:08.203 --> 00:24:13.355
naturally occur to you.
Let's linearize this example at

00:24:13.355 --> 00:24:15.263
the point zero,
zero.

00:24:15.263 --> 00:24:18.697
What should be the linearized
system?

00:24:18.697 --> 00:24:23.085
In other words,
it's only the nonlinear terms I

00:24:23.085 --> 00:24:29.000
have to worry about.
Well, the minus omega is fine.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.833
It is that stupid sine theta
that I don't like.

00:24:33.833 --> 00:24:37.722
But if theta is small,
in other words,

00:24:37.722 --> 00:24:42.871
if I stay near zero,
I could replace sine theta by

00:24:42.871 --> 00:24:46.654
theta.
The linearized system is minus

00:24:46.654 --> 00:24:49.701
two.
You replace sine theta by

00:24:49.701 --> 00:24:55.691
theta, since sine theta is
approximately theta if theta is

00:24:55.691 --> 00:25:02.114
small, if theta is near zero.
It is the first term of its

00:25:02.114 --> 00:25:06.344
Taylor series you can think of,
or it's just the linear

00:25:06.344 --> 00:25:10.104
approximation starts out sine
theta equals theta.

00:25:10.104 --> 00:25:12.767
That is it.
Or, you draw a picture.

00:25:12.767 --> 00:25:16.214
I don't know.
There are a millions of ways to

00:25:16.214 --> 00:25:17.780
do it.
So we have it.

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:21.305
Now what do I do?
Okay, now we will plot that.

00:25:21.305 --> 00:25:25.613
The matrix, let's do our little
routine, in other words.

00:25:25.613 --> 00:25:30.000
I am writing right to left for
no reason.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.408
The matrix is,
now I am just going to make

00:25:34.408 --> 00:25:39.247
marks on a board the way you did
on your exam,

00:25:39.247 --> 00:25:43.548
zero, one.
[LAUGHTER] I don't know what I

00:25:43.548 --> 00:25:47.419
am doing, but you know.
Negative two,

00:25:47.419 --> 00:25:51.505
negative one,
and then I write down the

00:25:51.505 --> 00:25:55.591
eigen-whatchamacallits.
Lambda squared,

00:25:55.591 --> 00:26:00.000
plus lambda,
minus the trace.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.389
The determinant is minus,
minus two, so it is plus two

00:26:05.389 --> 00:26:09.254
equals zero.
And then, since it doesn't

00:26:09.254 --> 00:26:14.847
occur to me how to factor this,
I will use the quadratic

00:26:14.847 --> 00:26:18.305
formula.
It is negative one plus or

00:26:18.305 --> 00:26:22.881
minus the square root of,
b squared minus 4ac,

00:26:22.881 --> 00:26:24.915
minus seven.
Complex.

00:26:24.915 --> 00:26:30.000
That means it is going to be a
spiral.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.653
I am going to get a spiral.
Will it be a source or a sink

00:26:34.653 --> 00:26:39.224
since they are complex roots?
Complex eigenvalues give a

00:26:39.224 --> 00:26:41.385
spiral.
A source or a sink?

00:26:41.385 --> 00:26:44.875
I tell that from the sine of
the real part.

00:26:44.875 --> 00:26:47.700
The real part is negative
one-half.

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:52.520
Therefore, the amplitude is
shrinking like e to the minus t

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:55.761
over two.
And, therefore,

00:26:55.761 --> 00:27:00.000
the spiral is coming into the
origin.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:05.931
It is a spiral sink since
lambda equals minus one-half

00:27:05.931 --> 00:27:10.072
plus some number times i.
Spiral sink.

00:27:10.072 --> 00:27:15.779
And the other thing to
determine is its direction of

00:27:15.779 --> 00:27:21.935
motion, which will be what?
I determine its direction of

00:27:21.935 --> 00:27:28.649
motion by putting in a single
vector from the velocity field.

00:27:28.649 --> 00:27:32.285
Here it is.
The vector at one,

00:27:32.285 --> 00:27:36.428
zero will be the
same as the first column of the

00:27:36.428 --> 00:27:38.071
matrix.
So that is zero,

00:27:38.071 --> 00:27:39.785
negative two.

00:27:39.785 --> 00:27:42.642
Here is a vector from the
velocity field,

00:27:42.642 --> 00:27:46.857
and that shows that the motion
is clockwise and is spiraling

00:27:46.857 --> 00:27:49.285
into the origin.
That is a picture,

00:27:49.285 --> 00:27:52.285
therefore, at the origin of how
that looks.

00:27:52.285 --> 00:27:55.357
Now, it is of the utmost
importance for your

00:27:55.357 --> 00:27:59.500
understanding of what comes now
that you understand in what

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:03.857
sense this picture corresponds
to the physical behavior of the

00:28:03.857 --> 00:28:08.580
pendulum.
Let's start it over here.

00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:13.327
What is it doing?
That means that theta is some

00:28:13.327 --> 00:28:16.217
number like one,
for example.

00:28:16.217 --> 00:28:20.861
Let's make it smaller.
Let's say a little bit.

00:28:20.861 --> 00:28:26.640
And this is the omega access.
If it starts over here that

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:32.213
means the angular velocity is
zero and theta is a small

00:28:32.213 --> 00:28:37.327
positive number.
Theta is a small positive

00:28:37.327 --> 00:28:40.679
number.
The angular velocity is zero.

00:28:40.679 --> 00:28:44.775
It's velocity zero,
theta small and positive.

00:28:44.775 --> 00:28:50.362
I release it and it does that.
What does this have to do with

00:28:50.362 --> 00:28:54.086
the spiral?
Well, the spiral is exactly a

00:28:54.086 --> 00:28:57.344
mathematical picture of this
motion.

00:28:57.344 --> 00:29:02.000
What happens?
Theta starts to decrease.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.256
And the angular velocity
increases but in the negative

00:29:06.256 --> 00:29:08.987
direction.
This is negative angular

00:29:08.987 --> 00:29:11.316
velocity.
Theta is decreasing.

00:29:11.316 --> 00:29:14.769
The angular velocity gets
bigger and bigger.

00:29:14.769 --> 00:29:18.383
And it is biggest,
most negative when theta is

00:29:18.383 --> 00:29:20.953
zero.
It has reached the vertical

00:29:20.953 --> 00:29:24.808
position is when the angular
velocity is biggest.

00:29:24.808 --> 00:29:27.860
It continues then.
Theta gets negative,

00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:33.000
but the angular velocity then
decreases to zero.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.319
Now the angular velocity is
zero and theta is at its most

00:29:41.319 --> 00:29:46.024
negative, and then it reverses.
Angular velocity gets positive

00:29:46.024 --> 00:29:48.724
as theta increases again,
and so on.

00:29:48.724 --> 00:29:52.735
These represent the successive
swings back and forth.

00:29:52.735 --> 00:29:57.132
Notice the fact that it is
damped is reflected in the fact

00:29:57.132 --> 00:30:01.528
that each successive swing,
the biggest that theta gets is

00:30:01.528 --> 00:30:05.000
a little less than it was
before.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.169
In other words,
this point is not quite as far

00:30:08.169 --> 00:30:11.338
out as that one.
And this one isn't as far out

00:30:11.338 --> 00:30:13.239
as that one.
In other words,

00:30:13.239 --> 00:30:15.000
it is spiraling in.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:26.525
Well, I hope that is clear
because we now have to go to the

00:30:26.525 --> 00:30:31.311
next critical point.
And now we have a little

00:30:31.311 --> 00:30:34.393
problem.
If I want to do the next

00:30:34.393 --> 00:30:38.535
critical point,
so what I want to do now is,

00:30:38.535 --> 00:30:42.484
in other words,
I want to linearize at the

00:30:42.484 --> 00:30:48.456
point pi zero where theta is pi
and the thing is sticking up in

00:30:48.456 --> 00:30:50.767
the air.
The question is,

00:30:50.767 --> 00:30:55.968
how am I going to do that?
This trick of replacing sine

00:30:55.968 --> 00:30:59.725
theta by theta,
that doesn't work at pi.

00:30:59.725 --> 00:31:03.000
That works at zero.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.282
Now we have to go to the next
step of the method.

00:31:11.282 --> 00:31:14.700
The way to do this,
in general, as you will read in

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:17.846
the notes because,
as I say, this is not in the

00:31:17.846 --> 00:31:20.170
book, is to calculate the
Jacobian.

00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:23.316
I mean the Jacobian matrix.
The Jacobian is the

00:31:23.316 --> 00:31:26.188
determinant.
I mean, before you put the two

00:31:26.188 --> 00:31:29.675
bars down and made a
determinant, you called it just

00:31:29.675 --> 00:31:34.330
the Jacobian matrix.
And the formula for it is,

00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:39.707
it is calculated from f and g.
The top line is the partial of

00:31:39.707 --> 00:31:44.367
f with respect to x and y,
and the bottom line is the

00:31:44.367 --> 00:31:47.594
partial of g with respect to x
and y.

00:31:47.594 --> 00:31:51.000
So that is the Jacobian matrix.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:02.378
I hope I get a chance at the
end of the period to explain to

00:32:02.378 --> 00:32:07.757
you why, but I am most anxious
right now to at least get you

00:32:07.757 --> 00:32:11.495
familiar with the algorithm,
how to do it.

00:32:11.495 --> 00:32:17.148
The notes describe the y of it,
if we don't get a chance to get

00:32:17.148 --> 00:32:20.886
to it, but I hope we will.
What do you do?

00:32:20.886 --> 00:32:25.535
The Jacobian matrix.
You calculate it at the point x

00:32:25.535 --> 00:32:29.000
zero, y zero.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.615
I will indicate that by putting
a subscript zero on it.

00:32:32.615 --> 00:32:35.695
This means without the
subscript zero it is the

00:32:35.695 --> 00:32:39.110
Jacobian matrix calculated out
of those four partial

00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:41.788
derivatives.
When I put a subscript zero,

00:32:41.788 --> 00:32:45.604
I mean I evaluated it at the
critical point by plugging in

00:32:45.604 --> 00:32:47.948
each entry as a function of x
and y.

00:32:47.948 --> 00:32:52.099
You plug in for x equals 
x zero, y equals y zero,

00:32:52.099 --> 00:32:54.643
and you get a numerical
matrix.

00:32:54.643 --> 00:33:00.000
That is the matrix which is the
matrix of the linearized system.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000
This is the matrix of the
linearized system.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.496
Trust me, it is.
Now, since I don't expect you

00:33:11.496 --> 00:33:16.391
to trust me, let's calculate it.
Here, we got the matrix another

00:33:16.391 --> 00:33:21.364
way, by this procedure of saying
sine theta is theta-- What would

00:33:21.364 --> 00:33:25.793
we have gotten if we had done it
instead by the linearized

00:33:25.793 --> 00:33:27.969
system?
Let's do it that way.

00:33:27.969 --> 00:33:31.000
Let's do it via the Jacobian.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:43.000
I need to know the Jacobian of
the system, which I have

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.888
conveniently covered up.
There is the system.

00:33:47.888 --> 00:33:52.444
The Jacobian matrix is what?
The top line,

00:33:52.444 --> 00:33:59.000
I take the partial derivative
of omega first with respect to

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.000
theta and then with respect to
omega.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.318
I then take the second line on
the right-hand side.

00:34:08.318 --> 00:34:12.292
I take its partial with respect
to theta first.

00:34:12.292 --> 00:34:16.697
That is negative two cosine
theta.

00:34:16.697 --> 00:34:20.757
And, thinking ahead,
I erase the one and move it

00:34:20.757 --> 00:34:24.990
over a little bit.
And what is the partial of that

00:34:24.990 --> 00:34:30.000
thing with respect to omega?
It is negative one.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:35.322
Does everyone see how I
calculated that Jacobian matrix?

00:34:35.322 --> 00:34:40.935
And now I want to evaluate it.
Let's do our old case first.

00:34:40.935 --> 00:34:45.193
At zero, zero what 
would this have

00:34:45.193 --> 00:34:49.258
amounted to?
This would have given me zero,

00:34:49.258 --> 00:34:52.548
one.
The cosine of theta at zero is

00:34:52.548 --> 00:34:56.612
one, so this is negative two,
negative one.

00:34:56.612 --> 00:35:00.000
I'm screwed.
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.166
That is the same as that.
Now you see it,

00:35:04.166 --> 00:35:08.437
now you don't.
We got our old answer back.

00:35:08.437 --> 00:35:14.375
That should give us enough
confidence to use it in the new

00:35:14.375 --> 00:35:20.312
case, where I don't have an old
answer to compare it with.

00:35:20.312 --> 00:35:23.854
What is it going to be at pi,
zero?

00:35:23.854 --> 00:35:30.000
The answer is J zero is
now going to be --

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.818
Well, everything is the same.
Zero, one, negative one.

00:35:34.818 --> 00:35:38.181
And here cosine of pi is
negative one,

00:35:38.181 --> 00:35:41.909
so negative two times negative
one is two.

00:35:41.909 --> 00:35:46.818
Everything is the same,
except there is a two there now

00:35:46.818 --> 00:35:51.454
instead of negative two.
Lambda squared plus lambda,

00:35:51.454 --> 00:35:54.727
the determinant,
is now negative two.

00:35:54.727 --> 00:36:00.090
And this factors into lambda
plus two times 

00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:04.000
lambda minus one.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.807
So lambda equals one.
The corresponding eigenvector.

00:36:12.807 --> 00:36:17.237
I subtract one here,
so the equation is minus a1

00:36:17.237 --> 00:36:20.254
plus a2 is zero.

00:36:20.254 --> 00:36:24.590
The solution is one,
one, e to the t.

00:36:24.590 --> 00:36:28.831
And for the other one,
it's lambda is equal to

00:36:28.831 --> 00:36:33.512
negative two.
This is the sort of stuff you

00:36:33.512 --> 00:36:38.797
can do, so I am doing it fast.
Zero minus negative two is two.

00:36:38.797 --> 00:36:43.909
So the equation is 2a1 plus a2
equals zero.

00:36:43.909 --> 00:36:48.068
And the solution is now,
I give a1 the value one,

00:36:48.068 --> 00:36:52.400
a2 will be negative two,
and that is times e to the

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:55.000
minus 2t.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:05.589
Well, what does the thing then
actually look like?

00:37:05.589 --> 00:37:11.634
What I am now going to do is,
I drew a picture before,

00:37:11.634 --> 00:37:17.680
that spiral picture we had
before of the way the thing

00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:22.357
looked at the point zero,
zero.

00:37:22.357 --> 00:37:27.718
So at the point pi,
zero how does it

00:37:27.718 --> 00:37:32.939
look, now?
Well, it looks like the origin,

00:37:32.939 --> 00:37:37.301
but I am thinking of it really
as the point pi,

00:37:37.301 --> 00:37:39.198
zero.
In other words,

00:37:39.198 --> 00:37:44.318
I am thinking of a linear
variable change sliding along

00:37:44.318 --> 00:37:50.103
the axis so that the point pi,
zero now looks like

00:37:50.103 --> 00:37:53.706
the origin.
If I do that then those two

00:37:53.706 --> 00:37:56.836
basic solutions,
there is the one,

00:37:56.836 --> 00:38:03.000
one solution which
is going out that way.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.126
And it is going out this way.
But the other guy is coming in

00:38:07.126 --> 00:38:09.505
along the vector one,
negative two.

00:38:09.505 --> 00:38:12.023
So one, negative two looks like
this.

00:38:12.023 --> 00:38:15.450
This guy is coming in at a
somewhat sharper angle,

00:38:15.450 --> 00:38:19.367
coming in because it is e to
the negative 2t.

00:38:19.367 --> 00:38:22.515
And we recognize this,
of course, as a saddle.

00:38:22.515 --> 00:38:26.362
And I would complete the
trajectories by putting in some

00:38:26.362 --> 00:38:30.000
of the typical saddle lines like
that.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:36.020
Now, I say that,
too, gives a picture of what is

00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:41.272
happening to the pendulum near
that point.

00:38:41.272 --> 00:38:44.987
Let's, for example,
look here.

00:38:44.987 --> 00:38:49.727
What is happening here?
This is theta,

00:38:49.727 --> 00:38:55.363
or really it is theta minus pi,
is this axis.

00:38:55.363 --> 00:39:01.000
In other words,
this will be zero.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:08.026
When theta is pi this will
correspond to the point zero.

00:39:08.026 --> 00:39:12.370
Here is omega.
What is theta doing?

00:39:12.370 --> 00:39:18.885
Starting up there this
represents a value of theta a

00:39:18.885 --> 00:39:25.656
little bit less than pi,
a little bit to the negative.

00:39:25.656 --> 00:39:33.517
A little bit less than pi.
Here is pi, so a little bit

00:39:33.517 --> 00:39:40.291
less than pi is over here.
A little bit less than pi.

00:39:40.291 --> 00:39:44.980
A little bit less.
And omega is zero.

00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:50.582
What happened?
Theta started decreasing ever

00:39:50.582 --> 00:39:56.314
more rapidly so that the omega
was zero here,

00:39:56.314 --> 00:40:04.000
now omega is negative and gets
much more negative.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:09.039
In other words,
both theta decreases from that

00:40:09.039 --> 00:40:14.639
point and omega decreases also.
What happened here?

00:40:14.639 --> 00:40:19.119
Here, theta is a little bit
more than pi.

00:40:19.119 --> 00:40:23.039
Now it is a little bit more
than pi.

00:40:23.039 --> 00:40:29.648
Theta now increases until it
gets to 2pi and then oscillates

00:40:29.648 --> 00:40:33.678
around 2pi.
So theta increases.

00:40:33.678 --> 00:40:37.564
And omega increases,
too, because the angular

00:40:37.564 --> 00:40:42.599
velocity started at zero but,
as theta gets more positive,

00:40:42.599 --> 00:40:46.220
omega gets positive,
too, because theta is

00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:49.665
increasing.
So omega increases and theta

00:40:49.665 --> 00:40:52.757
increases and it goes off like
that.

00:40:52.757 --> 00:40:58.145
Well, the final step is to put
them all together to be the big

00:40:58.145 --> 00:41:03.467
picture.
Here we are for three,

00:41:03.467 --> 00:41:12.295
let's say, the big picture.
Plot trajectories around each

00:41:12.295 --> 00:41:17.339
critical point and then add
some.

00:41:17.339 --> 00:41:25.694
It's that last step that can
cause you a little grief,

00:41:25.694 --> 00:41:32.000
but we will see how it works
out.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.688
Add some more,
according to your best

00:41:34.688 --> 00:41:37.674
judgment.
Let's make a big picture now of

00:41:37.674 --> 00:41:41.258
our pendulum the way it
apparently ought to look.

00:41:41.258 --> 00:41:45.365
Nice big axis since we are
going to accommodate a lot of

00:41:45.365 --> 00:41:48.874
critical points here.
Let's put in some critical

00:41:48.874 --> 00:41:50.815
points.
Here is the origin.

00:41:50.815 --> 00:41:55.295
And now here is the one at pi,
let's say, here is one at 2pi.

00:41:55.295 --> 00:42:00.000
I am going to add some of these
others, 3pi, 4pi.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:05.116
I won't in their values.
You can figure out what I mean.

00:42:05.116 --> 00:42:08.279
Zero here.
And then here it will be

00:42:08.279 --> 00:42:11.441
negative pi, and here negative
2pi.

00:42:11.441 --> 00:42:15.906
I guess I can stop there.
That is the theta axis,

00:42:15.906 --> 00:42:21.209
and here is the omega axis.
And now, at each one of these,

00:42:21.209 --> 00:42:25.674
I stay nearby and I draw the
linear trajectories,

00:42:25.674 --> 00:42:32.000
the trajectories of the
corresponding linearized system.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.650
We decided here that the spiral
went clockwise.

00:42:35.650 --> 00:42:40.174
Now, this point is physically,
of course, the same as that

00:42:40.174 --> 00:42:42.000
one.
But mathematically,

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:47.000
the Jacobian matrix is the same
also because if theta is 2pi the

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:51.285
cosine of 2pi is also one.
And this is the same matrix.

00:42:51.285 --> 00:42:54.777
So the analysis is identical.
And, therefore,

00:42:54.777 --> 00:42:59.539
this point will also correspond
to a counterclockwise spiral,

00:42:59.539 --> 00:43:04.606
as will this one.
I am sorry, a clockwise spiral.

00:43:04.606 --> 00:43:08.222
Here, too, all of these points
are the same.

00:43:08.222 --> 00:43:12.594
The behavior near them,
clockwise spirals everywhere.

00:43:12.594 --> 00:43:17.303
How about the other ones?
Well, the other ones correspond

00:43:17.303 --> 00:43:21.255
to these saddles,
so let's draw them efficiently

00:43:21.255 --> 00:43:26.636
by doing the same thing on every
one, mass production of saddles.

00:43:26.636 --> 00:43:30.000
There.
And these guys go out.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:35.299
And the other guys come in,
etc.

00:43:35.299 --> 00:43:44.358
And so here we have a little
bit there, a little here,

00:43:44.358 --> 00:43:50.000
here, there,
everywhere, etc.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.897
Now what?
Now you pray for inspiration.

00:44:01.897 --> 00:44:08.256
And what you have to do is add
trajectories that are compatible

00:44:08.256 --> 00:44:13.282
with the ones you have.
Let's start with this guy.

00:44:13.282 --> 00:44:18.205
Where is it going?
Well, a trajectory either goes

00:44:18.205 --> 00:44:22.923
off to infinity,
but generally they get trapped

00:44:22.923 --> 00:44:28.256
around critical points.
This guy must be surely doing

00:44:28.256 --> 00:44:32.128
this.
How about this one?

00:44:32.128 --> 00:44:35.487
Yeah, sure.
How about this one?

00:44:35.487 --> 00:44:38.512
Why not?
How about that one?

00:44:38.512 --> 00:44:42.320
Yeah.
But notice you are in trouble

00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:49.376
when two arrows you want to put
in are near each other and going

00:44:49.376 --> 00:44:54.304
in opposite directions.
That you cannot have.

00:44:54.304 --> 00:44:59.003
Continuity forbids it.
But notice if I,

00:44:59.003 --> 00:45:01.450
for example,
had gotten these eigenlines

00:45:01.450 --> 00:45:05.215
wrong, if I made this come in
and those go out because I made

00:45:05.215 --> 00:45:08.917
a simple error in drawing the
thing, I would have said but I

00:45:08.917 --> 00:45:12.933
cannot draw this picture because
this spiral wants to go that way

00:45:12.933 --> 00:45:16.258
but this, right next to it,
wants to go the other way.

00:45:16.258 --> 00:45:19.521
That is the way you would know
if you made a mistake.

00:45:19.521 --> 00:45:22.909
If you didn't make a mistake
you won't have any trouble

00:45:22.909 --> 00:45:26.235
filling these things out.
The directions of motions of

00:45:26.235 --> 00:45:30.000
the spirals, everything will be
compatible.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.021
Okay.
What is this guy doing?

00:45:33.021 --> 00:45:37.446
Oh, well, it must be joining up
with that.

00:45:37.446 --> 00:45:42.517
How about this one?
Well, it must be coming back

00:45:42.517 --> 00:45:45.215
there.
How about this one?

00:45:45.215 --> 00:45:48.561
Well, trajectories cannot
cross.

00:45:48.561 --> 00:45:53.525
This guy cannot cross so it
must be doing this.

00:45:53.525 --> 00:45:57.194
All right.
What is that trajectory?

00:45:57.194 --> 00:46:03.768
Starts zero.
Omega, on the other hand,

00:46:03.768 --> 00:46:10.251
is big and positive.
Omega big and positive.

00:46:10.251 --> 00:46:15.678
[LAUGHTER] I am scared.
Omega starts.

00:46:15.678 --> 00:46:21.256
Theta is zero.
Omega big and positive.

00:46:21.256 --> 00:46:28.190
It went around,
slowed up, but continued beyond

00:46:28.190 --> 00:46:30.911
pi.
And, in fact,

00:46:30.911 --> 00:46:33.714
went too far.
It continued to go here and

00:46:33.714 --> 00:46:36.097
then finally wound around that
one.

00:46:36.097 --> 00:46:40.091
Now do you see why we had to
have all the critical points?

00:46:40.091 --> 00:46:42.894
You have to have all the
critical points.

00:46:42.894 --> 00:46:47.169
And not just the two physicals
ones because the other critical

00:46:47.169 --> 00:46:51.514
points are necessary to describe
a complicated motion that goes

00:46:51.514 --> 00:46:56.000
round and round and round until
finally it crashes.

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.526
You are going to practice
drawing these pictures and

00:46:59.526 --> 00:47:02.192
interpreting them in recitation
tomorrow.
