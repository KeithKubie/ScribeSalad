00:00:06.196 --> 00:00:10.436
&gt;&gt;Dana: The use of space is a
staple of Montessori philosophy.

00:00:10.676 --> 00:00:16.726
If you would walk in to a Montessori
school in London or in Bangkok

00:00:16.726 --> 00:00:19.626
or any city around the world,
it's going to look very similar.

00:00:20.046 --> 00:00:21.506
&gt;&gt;Bella: Welcome to our classroom.

00:00:21.506 --> 00:00:25.956
We have our materials set up nice and
neat and I wanted to give you a tour.

00:00:28.116 --> 00:00:31.666
&gt;&gt;Dana: Part of our philosophy is
that we design the environment to

00:00:31.776 --> 00:00:33.896
draw out the child's natural curiosity.

00:00:35.096 --> 00:00:37.256
&gt;&gt;Bella: My favorite
part is doing culture.

00:00:37.496 --> 00:00:39.956
The population is the
most incredible thing.

00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:43.816
There's like 1.2 billion
people in India.

00:00:51.046 --> 00:00:54.386
&gt;&gt;Dollie: When we were designing
this building, we knew that we would

00:00:54.386 --> 00:00:56.536
like for this to be a Montessori school.

00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:58.776
We needed large classrooms.

00:00:58.936 --> 00:01:02.586
And, of course, the big
windows let the light in.

00:01:02.746 --> 00:01:05.976
Every classroom has access
to the outdoors.

00:01:06.046 --> 00:01:07.776
&gt;&gt;Student: Seven, eight, nine, ten.

00:01:08.316 --> 00:01:12.186
&gt;&gt;Phyllis: When the kids arrive
at school they come directly

00:01:12.186 --> 00:01:14.516
into our classroom, then
they go straight to work.

00:01:14.516 --> 00:01:15.016
&gt;&gt;Teacher: There you go.

00:01:15.296 --> 00:01:16.286
That's the one you need.

00:01:16.506 --> 00:01:21.006
&gt;&gt;Nathan: I get my day started
off by unpacking my book sack,

00:01:21.006 --> 00:01:25.686
and when I'm done I get all
my materials and my lesson.

00:01:26.116 --> 00:01:28.596
&gt;&gt;Phyllis: They choose their
work that they want to begin on

00:01:28.926 --> 00:01:32.576
and they unroll their rug and they
begin doing different lessons.

00:01:32.576 --> 00:01:35.696
And when they finish one lesson
they go and choose another lesson.

00:01:35.786 --> 00:01:37.386
&gt;&gt;Bella: I have done a few lessons.

00:01:38.236 --> 00:01:41.476
&gt;&gt;Amanda: They are allowed to get
their rug and position it wherever

00:01:41.476 --> 00:01:43.026
in the classroom that
they want to put it.

00:01:43.246 --> 00:01:46.546
Students may choose to work together or
they may choose to work individually.

00:01:47.176 --> 00:01:49.686
&gt;&gt;Phyllis Hyatt: The structure is
very different from traditional.

00:01:49.916 --> 00:01:51.976
&gt;&gt;Student: Twenty-one, twenty-two..

00:01:52.046 --> 00:01:55.366
&gt;&gt;Phyllis: The kids work for three and
a half hours, usually uninterrupted.

00:01:55.556 --> 00:01:57.536
If you have twenty students,

00:01:57.536 --> 00:02:00.026
you have twenty different
lessons going on at one time.

00:02:00.416 --> 00:02:03.976
&gt;&gt;Phyllis: We're going to stack it
so that we can read our numeral.

00:02:05.516 --> 00:02:08.046
&gt;&gt;Amanda: Research has shown
that it's very important

00:02:08.046 --> 00:02:09.446
for kids to be able to move.

00:02:09.766 --> 00:02:12.386
Children at this age don't
have a large attention span.

00:02:12.696 --> 00:02:14.996
So, they don't learn as
much if they're sitting

00:02:14.996 --> 00:02:17.906
in a forty-minute lecture
listening to the teacher talk.

00:02:18.716 --> 00:02:22.266
In a Montessori room, they're able
to move as much as they need to move

00:02:22.266 --> 00:02:23.976
in order to activate their brain.

00:02:24.086 --> 00:02:27.966
&gt;&gt;Dollie: The Montessori classroom--
you can't change it up a lot.

00:02:28.256 --> 00:02:33.416
All of the lessons have to be in very
particular spots, in a particular order.

00:02:33.606 --> 00:02:36.856
&gt;&gt;Nathan: This is where we
learn all about our state

00:02:37.186 --> 00:02:39.726
and this helps us learn about time.

00:02:39.726 --> 00:02:43.826
&gt;&gt;Dan: As the shelves progress, the
lessons get more and more challenging.

00:02:43.976 --> 00:02:48.346
So, the child is really able to see the
other materials that they'll be able

00:02:48.346 --> 00:02:50.876
to learn as well as how
far they've come.

00:02:52.186 --> 00:02:53.666
&gt;&gt;Bella: Case is the snack helper.

00:02:53.766 --> 00:02:58.696
Mady is the substitute and she
is also the zoologist,

00:02:59.206 --> 00:03:01.536
and my job is the teacher's assistant.

00:03:01.636 --> 00:03:04.416
&gt;&gt;Phyllis: Our "Practical Life" is a
big part of Montessori and that's

00:03:04.416 --> 00:03:06.076
where the kids wash the dishes;

00:03:06.076 --> 00:03:09.086
if the room needs dusting,
they have dusting cloths.

00:03:09.266 --> 00:03:11.666
We also have animals
that they take care of.

00:03:12.086 --> 00:03:15.726
&gt;&gt;Amanda: We have gardens outside of
our classroom that they take care of.

00:03:16.366 --> 00:03:17.576
&gt;&gt;Group: What do you say--

00:03:19.046 --> 00:03:21.526
&gt;&gt;Amanda: Taking care of yourself
and the environment around you,

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.300
it's part of growing the whole child.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.820
&gt;&gt;Amanda: In Montessori, it's
important for children to understand

00:03:28.046 --> 00:03:30.556
that there's a very big world out there
and we're just a small piece of it.
