(mouse clicking)
(electronic chiming)

00:00:05.355 --> 00:00:09.105
(pulsating electronic music)

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.010
- Welcome to A Conversation with History.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.760
I'm Harry Kreisler

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.360
of the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.720
Our guest today is Eugenie C. Scott

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.780
who is the founding executive director

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.850
of the National Center
for Science Education.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.400
She is a past president

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.680
of the American Association
of Physical Anthropologists.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.240
Among her most notable recent honors,

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.670
the Public Service Medal

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.980
of the National Academy of Sciences,

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.520
the Fellows Medal of the
California Academy of Sciences,

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.030
and the first Stephen Jay Gould Prize,

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.660
Society for the Study of Evolution.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.660
Scott is the author of
Evolution Versus Creationism

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.550
and co-editor with Glen Branch
of Not in Our Classrooms:

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.550
Why Intelligent Design
is Wrong for Our Schools.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.820
Eugenie, welcome to Berkeley.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.280
- Thank you.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.870
- Where were you born and raised?

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.500
- La Crosse, Wisconsin,
and I was born there

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.550
but we kind of bounced between La Cross,

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.350
Minneapolis, and Milwaukee.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.250
- And looking back,

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.680
did your parents shape your
thinking about the world?

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.690
- Hardly at all, (laughs)

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.140
because my father left my mother

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.310
when I was about four years old or so.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.920
I really don't have any
memory of him living with us.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.010
He was somebody who
visited on odd occasions.

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.650
My mother had four kids

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.510
and she was kinda running
pretty hard most of the time

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.913
just kinda keeping up
with us and the world.

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.610
I think I got interested in science

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.150
despite my family upbringing
more than anything else.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.050
- And what about religion, was
religion a part of your life?

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.070
- My mother was Christian Science

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.893
and initially we went to the
Christian Science church.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.070
I remember the Sunday school
being terribly, terribly boring

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.543
because they'd give us a Bible,

00:02:33.543 --> 00:02:36.920
this is the worst Sunday
school approach ever,

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.680
and the kids who could read

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.670
would go through the columns on the page

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.250
counting the number of times
the word love occurred.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.340
No wonder people leave churches.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.980
I mean, that was just terrible.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.010
When I was probably, I don't know,

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.130
maybe seven, eight, nine years old or so,

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.720
my older sister decided

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.570
that Christian Science
wasn't really where it was at

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.780
so she took us to the
Congregational church

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.130
in our neighborhood

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.140
and I enjoyed attending the
Congregational church very much.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.850
Now it's called the
United Church of Christ,

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.250
but that's the historical name for it.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.040
I sang in the choir,

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.370
remained in the church
through high school.

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.940
- And was it school then
that drew you into science?

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.853
And when did science spark for you?

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.510
- I think I just, I was
always interested in nature,

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.770
and I think that's the way a
lot of people get into science.

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.210
They are interested in animals or bugs

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:44.180
or stars or dirt or something like that,

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.180
and I remember as a
fourth-grade kid in Minneapolis,

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:51.730
living there at the time,

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.980
there was a vacant lot
at the end of our block

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.420
and now it's got an
apartment building on it

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.030
but at the time it was a vacant lot,

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.450
and I would go there and
I would lie in the dirt

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.870
and the grass and I
would look for creatures

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.980
and just smell the sounds
and listen to the birds

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.920
and I was just very, very happy

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.570
to just be immersed in that kind of tiny,

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.250
I called it my miniature Serengeti.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.870
This was my tiny little
refuge from the busy city

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.190
and the streets and
the cars and the noise.

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.230
- And when were you drawn to anthropology?

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.840
Was it as an undergraduate
or a graduate student?

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.373
- Before that, actually.

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:31.990
My, (laughs)

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.500
I suppose I shouldn't
really tell this story

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.940
about my older sister,
but my older sister,

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.000
one of my older sisters was attending

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.430
the University of Minnesota

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.400
and she brought home her textbooks

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.520
and she was taking a course
in anthropology, and yeah,

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.720
then as now, I was pretty
much of a compulsive reader.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.020
I must have been probably
in sixth or seventh grade,

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.920
sixth grade maybe.

00:04:55.538 --> 00:04:58.040
And I started looking through
this book called Anthropology.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.360
I didn't know what anthropology was,

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.440
and I came to the human evolution section,

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.620
and there were these, and
I know what they are now,

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.390
of course, as a professional,

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.660
but they were the old
Smithsonian Institution

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.493
reconstructions from, like,
the turn of the century,

00:05:13.995 --> 00:05:17.830
of Cro-Magnon and
Neanderthal and Homo erectus,

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.159
and I looked at these, whoa!

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:23.630
It was just, this was
just the most, who are,

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:24.930
what is this, what's this?

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.950
And she said, well, that's
called anthropology.

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:31.750
Okay, I wanna be an anthropologist

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.460
because these are our ancestors

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.610
and I actually said at the time,

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.140
this kinda looks like your boyfriend

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:43.140
and she didn't like that
at all, but nonetheless,

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.880
I got inspired by looking
at a college textbook

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.250
when I was in about sixth grade.

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:53.240
Then in seventh grade,
my junior high teacher,

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.660
middle school teacher, assigned us,

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.750
and by that time we
had moved to Milwaukee,

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.470
he assigned us a term paper, as it were,

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:06.080
that we had to write a
biography of a famous scientist

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.220
which was a really boring
topic, but nonetheless,

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:09.340
that's what they did back then.

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:14.340
And so I decided to do a
term paper on Eugene Dubois

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.493
who was the discoverer
of Homo erectus, which,

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:23.640
my teacher had never heard
of Eugene Dubois at all.

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.270
He didn't know what Homo erectus was

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:26.720
and I think I got an A on the paper

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.810
'cause he had no idea
what I was talking about,

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:30.920
but I had to go to the public library

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.340
and find these references
on human evolution

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.450
which were way above my reading level,

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:38.710
'cause they were all college-level stuff,

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:42.150
but I would love to have
had that paper now (laughs)

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:44.510
to see what I had extracted from those.

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:49.300
- So it was natural for you
to major in anthropology

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.180
and then do your dissertation on that.

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:52.200
- Absolutely.
- And where did you do

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.683
your dissertation and who was your mentor?

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:59.310
- I did my master's at UW Milwaukee,

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:02.780
my bachelor's and my master's
there, and then came out,

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.060
moved out to California
with my first husband

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:09.550
and he was an anthropology
professor, actually,

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:13.003
and worked out here for a
while with a master's degree.

00:07:13.913 --> 00:07:17.790
That was in the late '60s
when you could do that.

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:20.060
You could teach at the college
level with a, you know,

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:22.060
the soldiers were coming back from the war

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.190
and there was a real need
for college professors,

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:26.350
so I was able to teach
at the university level

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:28.700
with a master's degree, and I loved it.

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:31.057
I really, really liked
explaining evolution

00:07:31.057 --> 00:07:34.190
and anthropology to students

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:35.970
who were only a couple
years younger than I was,

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:38.270
but nonetheless, and so I just said,

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:39.710
I really have to get a graduate degree,

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:41.150
I really have to get a PhD.

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:46.150
So one of my professors
from UWM had subsequently,

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:49.950
and had a few years there,

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:53.440
had moved to the University of
Missouri and I thought, well,

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:57.090
I still have more to learn from
him and he treated me fairly

00:07:57.090 --> 00:08:00.680
so I went and got my PhD at
the University of Missouri.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.350
- [Harry] And what was
your dissertation on?

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:05.490
- Bones and teeth. (laughs)

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:09.940
I had gone to Peru to work with a series

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:14.560
of archeologically excavated
skeletal materials,

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:18.840
which was a really great series

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:23.230
of South American, Native American remains

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:25.770
because they were all
radiometrically dated.

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:29.720
We knew what time period
these bodies had come from,

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:33.680
and we also knew from the
archeological information

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:38.070
what their subsistence, food
supply, et cetera, had been

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:42.090
so I had a string of skeletons

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:45.170
that went from very early
hunting and gatherer

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:48.350
through various intermediate
forms of food production

00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:52.910
to full corn, bean, squash,
Inca food production,

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:54.550
and what happens to their teeth

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:56.050
and their cranial facial structure

00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:58.940
when you make those kinds
of changes and diet.

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:01.860
So it was an interesting topic,

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:03.810
although the sample was really small

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:06.950
and so I don't think anybody
is actually looking up

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:09.590
that dissertation for great enlightenment,

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:11.210
but I basically found things

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:13.380
that people have found subsequently.

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:18.380
- How do you account for your movement

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:23.560
from physical anthropology
to advocacy and activism?

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:27.240
Interestingly enough, focused

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.900
on the first instance on evolution.

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:32.563
- Well, you know, it's
an interesting thing.

00:09:35.603 --> 00:09:37.940
(sighs) At the time,
when I started teaching

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:41.630
after I got my PhD, that was in 1974

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:45.963
at the University of
Kentucky, and at the time,

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:49.340
it's changed fortunately since then,

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:52.470
but at the time, if you
wanted to study evolution,

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:54.850
the place that you were
guaranteed to get evolution

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:56.910
was in the anthropology department.

00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:00.230
I would teach a service
course, as we called them,

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:02.790
and it was a great service course

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:06.370
because if you were a social
studies or humanities major,

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:08.900
you could take my biological anthro class

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:10.310
for social science credit.

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:11.550
If you were a science major,

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:13.020
you could take it for science credit,

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:15.150
or vice versa if you needed to (laughs)

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:17.280
fulfill some university requirement.

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:18.630
So I had all kinds of people

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:21.120
in my introductory physical
anthropology class,

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:24.970
and I would have these biology
majors who were seniors

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:28.700
who just needed to kinda tidy
up their class requirements

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:30.480
so that they could graduate, so, oh well,

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.940
this sounds kinda like science.

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:34.240
Let's take that and
we'll check off the box

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.263
for social studies.

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:37.420
And of course they found

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:38.530
that it was a whole lot more science

00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:40.270
than they thought it
was, but there you go.

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:43.283
And at the end of this
semester, I would have,

00:10:44.643 --> 00:10:47.230
'cause basically we got
evolution from day one,

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:48.750
and at the end of the semester,

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:52.560
I would have students come up
to me and say, so that's it.

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:53.760
(both laughing)

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:58.760
Because over in the biology
department in the mid 1970s,

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:01.440
they really weren't being explicit

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:04.943
about common ancestry explains
everything in biology.

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:09.440
We would talk about taxonomy,
the Linnaean system,

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:12.600
and kingdom, phylum, class,
order, genus, and species,

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:17.120
and I just once mentioned
to my students and said, oh,

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:20.720
and the reason why we can group animals

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:23.010
in this hierarchical fashion,

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:24.490
we can group species into genera,

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:26.010
genera into families, et cetera,

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:28.020
is because evolution generates hierarchy

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:30.110
and that was the, so that's it.

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:31.560
There was this sorta, oh.

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.740
So I was kind of an astral leap

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:38.240
in evolution from day one as an academic.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:41.160
Then when I was living in Lexington,

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:44.330
the Lexington Board of
Education was approached

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:48.250
by the Citizens for
Balanced Teaching of Origins

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:50.840
in 1980 which was a community group

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:53.140
that wanted the Lexington
Board of Education

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:56.040
to include this new
science of creation science

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:57.340
to teach along with evolution,

00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:00.190
and we'd be on the cutting
edge of science education.

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:04.190
And I had gotten interested
in the creationist movement

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:05.560
really as a graduate student,

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:09.440
'cause Jim Gavin who's,
you asked my mentors,

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.590
Jim Gavin was probably my main mentor

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:14.190
as shaping my view of anthropology.

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:16.160
Wonderful man, now deceased,

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:18.760
but Jim gave me some
creationist literature

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:21.520
when I was a first-year graduate student.

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:23.130
Man, I started collecting this stuff

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:24.470
'cause it was so interesting.

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:28.170
So when this big controversy
happened in Lexington,

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:29.930
I was the person on campus.

00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:31.710
I was the person in the science faculty

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:34.050
who actually knew what
creation science was

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:36.200
and I had a whole box
of literature for it,

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:39.320
so I got interested in the creation

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:41.653
and evolution controversy pretty early.

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:49.070
- The skills and temperament
of a physical anthropologist

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:53.620
and the skills and
temperament of an activist,

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:56.810
somebody who's an advocate,
are somewhat different.

00:12:56.810 --> 00:13:00.600
Did the second build on
the first, in other words,

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:04.090
or was there not that much
contradiction between the two?

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:08.190
- You know, I don't
know that I can go along

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:11.320
with your premise 'cause I don't know

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:15.010
that biological anthropologists differ

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:17.690
from any other academic, or even, frankly,

00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:19.130
that academics differ that much

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:22.093
from accountants or
dentists or anybody else.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.240
I think that, for example,
in the Lexington controversy,

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.980
which really took almost
two years to resolve,

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:32.910
and to cut to the chase,
the good guys won.

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:36.350
The Lexington District decided
not to require the teachers

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:38.180
to teach creation science.

00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:40.260
But I worked with clergy,

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.620
I worked with civil liberty supporters

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:46.960
who were businessmen
and just normal people,

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:49.320
and of course, there were a
lot of us up on the campus

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.650
but they were from not just
the science disciplines

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:55.410
but also history and poli sci
and philosophy of science,

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:57.450
so there were a lot of us,

00:13:57.450 --> 00:14:01.300
and those of us who do get interested

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:05.430
in this kind of activist
approach, and it is activism,

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:08.270
were trying to influence what
goes on in our communities.

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:09.570
That's activism.

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:11.383
Those of us who were interested,

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:16.090
I think, were different from
other people in the community,

00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:18.520
'cause, A, we cared, (laughs)

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:20.640
but we cared for different reasons.

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:22.470
We cared for different reasons.

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:25.380
The clergy that I worked with were upset

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:27.740
at the thought that
somebody would be teaching

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:29.860
biblical literalism Monday through Friday

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:32.710
and they'd have to straighten
the kids out on the weekend,

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:34.730
on Saturday or Sunday in their churches,

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:38.290
'cause we don't believe
that in our denomination.

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:39.540
And so the Catholics

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:41.890
and the mainstream
Protestants were on my side.

00:14:43.589 --> 00:14:45.630
The business community
didn't like the idea

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:47.820
of the schools teaching creationism

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:52.820
because kids would be raised
with an inferior education.

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:58.050
You don't deliberately teach
things that are not true.

00:14:58.050 --> 00:15:00.200
The teachers didn't like
it because they felt

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:02.490
that they would be violating some

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:05.860
of their professional
standards by teaching nonsense

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:08.240
when their job is to teach good stuff.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.820
So everybody had different reasons

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:12.550
for opposing the teaching of creationism,

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:13.680
but all of us, I think,

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:15.960
had to be willing to step up to the plate

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:19.440
and the most effective of us

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:21.780
had to have communication skills

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:24.870
that enabled us to do a good job,

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:27.290
to persuade the decision-makers
that our point of view

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:28.840
is the one that they should take.

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:31.030
And to some degree,

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:33.660
being a college professor
helps you on that

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:36.363
because frankly, we're all salesmen.

00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:40.480
You sold political science
(laughs) when you taught.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:43.910
I sold anthropology, in
the best sense of the term,

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:47.450
in that you are providing a set of ideas

00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:49.570
to somebody that you want them to accept.

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:53.790
- The difference is that in your work,

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:55.240
and you were the founding director,

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:58.293
I wanna talk about your organization,

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:04.220
is that there's greater
diversity as you mobilize people.

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:08.990
There must be a lot of listening,

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:10.860
oh, is that what's bothering you,

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:14.660
then let me address that,
among different groups

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:17.870
and kind of learning that, hey,

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:20.610
the business community may be on our side

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:24.770
for reasons having to with
whatever the skills they need.

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:26.110
So talk a little about that,

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:30.140
'cause that's different than
what an academic is doing.

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:32.270
- Yeah, it is in some respects,

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:37.180
but in a way, well, I'm
trained as an anthropologist.

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:38.850
I'm a biological anthropologist

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:40.850
which really is a subfield of biology

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:45.850
and certainly the vast majority
of the research activity

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:47.450
that is done is indistinguishable

00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:49.570
from what we're doing in a biology class

00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:52.797
except that as an anthropologist,

00:16:52.797 --> 00:16:56.140
we look at humans and primates

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:58.900
with an additional edge, as it were,

00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:01.753
and that is in the cultural
and historical context.

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:05.180
When you study anthropology,

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:07.560
you study not just physical anthropology.

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:10.810
You study cultural anthropology
and archeology as well.

00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:12.730
It's a very holistic kind of view

00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:16.880
of what makes humans tick, and as such,

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.040
one of the things that you learn

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:23.430
is that if you're really going
to understand a point of view

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:26.080
you have to embed yourself, so to speak.

00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:27.350
You have to spend the time

00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:29.590
and you have to do a lot of listening.

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:31.890
It's kind of an ethnographic
approach, really,

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:35.890
and I think my being an anthropologist

00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:40.210
did contribute a lot to the
orientation that I took.

00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:43.420
Anthropologists also tend
to look in terms of systems,

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:46.180
and so I didn't know anything

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:51.150
about the public education
system in the city of Lexington.

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:52.480
I didn't have a kid in the school.

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:54.440
I didn't pay any attention at all to it,

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:55.810
but I learned that there's a difference

00:17:55.810 --> 00:17:59.470
between the superintendent
and the Board of Education

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:01.420
and who reports to whom

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:03.840
and what does a department chairman do

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.370
and what's his relationship
to the superintendent

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:09.040
and who is actually the
decision-maker in all of this

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:10.950
and what's the responsibility of teachers.

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:15.260
I learned that K-12 teachers
don't have academic freedom

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:18.430
that we have at the university level.

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:19.810
It's a very, very different thing,

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:22.560
and actually there's very
good reasons for that.

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:25.170
So one of the things I had to do

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:28.390
when I just sort of stepped into this mess

00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:32.320
in the Lexington, what we'd
call a flare-up at NCSE

00:18:33.867 --> 00:18:37.800
when I was one of the leaders
and coping with this flare-up

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:42.800
is I had to figure out the
political system, (laughs)

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:47.240
but also what's going on
in the religious community

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:50.700
and I had to spend time with them.

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:53.350
I had some very good
informants in Rabbi Leffler

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:56.083
and the Unitarian minister then.

00:18:58.111 --> 00:19:00.433
What are the forces within
the religious community

00:19:00.433 --> 00:19:02.610
that could help to
support my point of view

00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:04.370
versus those who oppose?

00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:07.513
But also, and here's where the
real anthropology comes in,

00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:11.440
why do they feel the way they do?

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:14.783
Why is there this strong
opposition to evolution?

00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:17.980
People don't just do
things for no good reason.

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:21.930
What are the reasons that
people are so concerned

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:24.920
about their kids learning
evolution in the public schools?

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:27.553
And if you really understand that,

00:19:28.626 --> 00:19:31.220
can you start a conversation
to try to figure out

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:33.650
how you can assuage those concerns?

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:36.313
Because they're very real
and they're very sincere.

00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:39.363
- In establishing your organization,

00:19:40.673 --> 00:19:43.750
the National Center for Science Education,

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:45.500
what was the biggest challenge

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:48.863
and what surprised you the
most as you were doing that?

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:52.713
- Well, the biggest
challenge for any non-profit,

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:55.720
we were talking about I
was a college professor

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:59.340
and then I became a
non-profit manager. (sighs)

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:01.933
I didn't know anything about
running a small business

00:20:01.933 --> 00:20:05.360
and that's what a non-profit
is, it's a business.

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:08.420
A non-profit cannot be no-profit

00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:12.270
because if you make no-profit,
you go out of business.

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:15.210
That's the nature of a business.

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:16.960
It's just that any profits you make

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:19.530
have to be plowed back into
your mission and so forth,

00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:21.580
but you have to be in the black,

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:26.483
otherwise you fire your staff
and you take your books home.

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:29.980
So learning how to run a business

00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:31.813
was actually not that hard.

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:34.650
The business community
might wince at that point,

00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:37.380
but I had a PhD in science,

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:39.080
I can learn how to run a business.

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:42.233
It's not rocket science.

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:49.010
But fundraising, persuading
people to give money

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:53.260
to support the kinds of
things that NCSE does,

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:56.663
which is basically a lot of
what I learned in Lexington.

00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:59.560
These problems of the
teaching of evolution

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:01.503
are local and state problems.

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:04.520
That's where education takes place.

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:06.110
We're very decentralized,

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:10.070
so what we did at NC, and do
and continue my successor,

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:13.360
what NCSE does is support
people in communities

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:17.270
who want to see that their kids
get good science education.

00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:22.270
So we help them form coalitions
with like-minded people

00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:25.950
to find out all of the interest
groups in their community

00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:27.870
that might care about this issue

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:30.570
and how can you all work together.

00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:32.790
We teach them how to write letters

00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:34.010
to the editor, if they need to.

00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:37.580
We teach them how to
make a good presentation

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:39.660
to a school board or
to a board of education

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:41.950
at the state level or a state legislature

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:45.820
because there are definitely
skills involved in that.

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:48.380
We give them the background in science

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:50.350
which they often do not know.

00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:53.070
We give them the background
in theology many times,

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:55.680
which is also a very
important part of this.

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:57.750
We give them the legal backgrounds

00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:59.890
because this is ultimately a matter

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:03.070
of church and state
separation, foundationally.

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:05.210
We talk about the pedagogical issues

00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:06.750
and there's even philosophical,

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:08.830
philosophy of science issues as well,

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:10.590
so there's a lot of different areas

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:12.850
that nobody knows everything about

00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:15.150
but NCSE can help local groups

00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:17.710
to have the information that they need

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:21.270
to make the argument that
good science should be taught,

00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:22.310
evolution should be taught,

00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:24.460
nature of science should be taught.

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:27.910
Religiously-based groups
can be taught about

00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:29.330
outside of science classes

00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:31.040
but they should not be presented

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:34.470
as true science in a science class.

00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:36.940
- What about the community of scientists?

00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:39.683
You were a scientist.

00:22:41.296 --> 00:22:42.485
- [Eugenie] Hopefully still am.

00:22:42.485 --> 00:22:43.318
(both laughing)

00:22:43.318 --> 00:22:47.576
- You were sounding the alarm
bell in the night in a way.

00:22:47.576 --> 00:22:52.576
Was there difficulty there
in getting scientists out

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:58.100
of their labs and into the public space?

00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:01.920
- Well, (sighs) we're talking,

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:06.700
I became director of NCSE
in the late '80s, 1986.

00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:10.830
By the 1980s, I think there
had been enough creationism,

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:13.610
and of course intelligent
design was just starting

00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:15.730
to ramp up in the late '80s,

00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:17.760
that I think the science community

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:20.700
was having this wait a minute moment,

00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:24.960
and of course most of my
staff were from the science.

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:27.450
I'm a scientist, most of
my staff were from science,

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:30.830
and I think all of us had connections

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:32.720
with different scientist disciplines

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:34.940
and we found scientists very responsive.

00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:39.440
Now, not 100% but that's
gonna be the case any time,

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:44.440
but one of the sources that we tapped

00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:48.420
was the associations of science,

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:51.120
the American Association for
the Advancement of Science,

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:52.950
the National Academy of Sciences

00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:54.900
which is not really an association but,

00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:00.330
GSA, Geological Society of America,

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:01.920
of course the Physical Anthropologists.

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:04.450
They were strongly behind us.

00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:07.480
The various American Institute
for Biological Sciences.

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:10.380
There were a lot of
scientist organizations

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:15.360
that NCSE dealt with and
I would be asked to speak

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:18.370
at their meetings and I would
speak with their officers

00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:20.777
and help explain why this is a problem

00:24:20.777 --> 00:24:22.700
and why we needed scientists to help

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:24.310
and what scientists could do to help,

00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:27.020
and we established networks of scientists.

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:28.670
So scientists and teachers

00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:30.910
were actually our core constituencies.

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:35.260
In fact, back in the
late '70s and early '80s,

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:39.100
early '80s certainly, when
NCSE was just getting started,

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:41.450
it was scientists and teachers

00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:45.240
who really put this organization together.

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:50.240
- Help us understand
the way scientists think

00:24:50.490 --> 00:24:54.000
and the way creationists,

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.763
let's just create that broad category.

00:24:58.908 --> 00:25:02.960
What's the difference
in the way they think

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:07.530
and then the hurdle in getting
them to talk to each other

00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:10.550
or at least understand each
other if not talk to each other?

00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:14.023
- I think the first thing
is to make a distinction.

00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:17.200
You said scientists and creationists,

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:20.123
and that tends to be two separate sets.

00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:23.590
Although some creationists
are trained in science,

00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:26.670
they're pretty much outside
of the scientific mainstream.

00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:30.160
That's very different from
saying that there are two sets,

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:32.250
scientists and religious people.

00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:33.520
That's not the same thing

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:36.280
because many religious
people are scientists.

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:38.430
Many scientists are religious people.

00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:40.930
Many theologians are really
interested in science

00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:43.010
and that's part of their theology.

00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:47.220
So it's not a distinction
between science and religion

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:49.250
so much as it is a distinction

00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:53.863
between scientifically-oriented
people and everybody else.

00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:56.590
And I think this is really
what you're getting to

00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:58.670
but I wanted to be sure
to make that distinction

00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:00.770
because I'm not talking
about all religious people

00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:03.260
when I'm talking about creationists.

00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:05.630
The difference between creationists

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:10.620
and real scientists, if you will,

00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:13.880
is that creationists
start with a conclusion.

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:16.440
They have the revealed truth of the Bible

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:21.440
and they believe that this
trumps all empirical evidence.

00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:26.030
If there's a difference between
what their interpretation

00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:28.550
of the Bible says and
what you see in nature,

00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:31.380
well, you just must not be
interpreting nature correctly.

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:33.980
And the way they interpret the Bible,

00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:36.240
the traditional young Earth creationists,

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:39.370
the Bible is interpreted
as requiring a young Earth

00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:42.540
of only thousands of years old, 6,000.

00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:44.910
The more radical will go
all the way up to 10,000,

00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:48.630
but certainly not billions,
not anywhere near that.

00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:51.050
The Bible requires, in
their interpretation,

00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:53.700
the special creation
of the whole universe,

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:58.590
so galaxies and stars and Earth
are all specially created.

00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:00.270
God just went, let there be,

00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:03.340
and animals and plants and human beings

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:07.330
are specially created
according to special kinds.

00:27:07.330 --> 00:27:09.450
You can have evolution within the kind,

00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:12.280
so you can have a dog kind
and you can have the evolution

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:15.900
of wolves and foxes and domestic dogs,

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:17.350
but that's still the kind.

00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:18.520
The kind is different.

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:21.960
It was a created kind
and you don't get dogs

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:23.610
and bears having a common ancestor.

00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:25.210
That's just not allowed whatsoever.

00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:27.060
So they start with a conclusion,

00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:28.780
this is the way the world is,

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:30.380
and then they basically look

00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:32.490
through the scientific information

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:35.140
to try to find the stuff that supports it.

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:38.890
Now, any scientist
who's got an explanation

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:41.310
is gonna look for
corroborating information.

00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:42.910
We're all gonna look for the stuff

00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:45.060
that supports our point of view,

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:47.800
but if you're a real
scientist, you go an extra step

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:50.540
and you say, if I'm
wrong, what should I find?

00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:52.710
And then you have to look for that.

00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:54.300
And this is the big difference

00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:56.800
between creationists and real scientists.

00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:59.240
They're ignoring any of the information

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:00.993
that refutes their point of view.

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:04.380
- The non-scientists?

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:05.770
- Non-scientists, yeah.
- Yeah.

00:28:05.770 --> 00:28:07.910
- The creationists have the truth.

00:28:07.910 --> 00:28:10.330
They cherry-pick the
data that supports them

00:28:10.330 --> 00:28:14.570
and ignore or somehow
explain away any data

00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:19.050
that would refute their point of view

00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:21.833
of special creation, a
young Earth, et cetera.

00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:28.260
- Scientists are constantly,
as you point out in your book,

00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:33.690
rethinking their theories
based on the empirical evidence

00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:39.490
and in a way, the very rigor
and protocol of science

00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:46.730
makes their conclusions
potentially vulnerable

00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:50.097
in the public sphere,

00:28:50.097 --> 00:28:53.050
and I gather from your discussion

00:28:53.050 --> 00:28:55.500
of the history of the creationists

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:58.770
is that as they move
toward trying to come up

00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:02.410
with a scientific explanation of creation

00:29:02.410 --> 00:29:07.410
that they build on a platform
that attacks the fact

00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:09.500
that scientists are changing their mind.

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:11.100
Talk a little about that,

00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:13.300
but the scientists are changing their mind

00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:15.223
based on empirical evidence.

00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:18.490
They're revising their thinking.

00:29:18.490 --> 00:29:23.480
- Yeah, science is an
open-ended way of knowing.

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:26.260
It's an epistemology that
allows you to change your mind.

00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:29.120
It's a feature, not a bug, okay? (laughs)

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:31.910
But that doesn't mean that
everything in science changes

00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:34.280
and I think that's an initial idea

00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:36.150
that I think people may not understand.

00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:41.150
There are a core set of explanations

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:44.530
that have just been tested so much

00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:47.363
that we're not gonna change them, okay.

00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:50.990
Matter is composed of atoms.

00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:52.920
The Earth goes around the sun.

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:55.420
Geocentrism is here to stay.

00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:58.310
Laws of thermodynamics, living
things have common ancestors.

00:29:58.310 --> 00:30:00.830
There's a lot of core ideas
that just aren't gonna change.

00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:03.080
There's a lot of ideas
that are frontier ideas

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:04.520
and this is where scientists are working.

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:07.550
Some of them are gonna
work and go into the core.

00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:08.770
Some of them are not gonna work

00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:11.610
and we abandon them and
that's fine, but not every,

00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:14.350
science is open-ended but it's reliable,

00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:15.183
and that's important.

00:30:15.183 --> 00:30:17.480
That's an important distinction to have.

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:20.120
Now, one of the problems
that creationists have

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:25.120
which you mentioned is
that they are not flexible

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:27.650
in changing their explanations.

00:30:27.650 --> 00:30:29.810
New evidence is not gonna make them

00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:31.910
alter their point of view.

00:30:31.910 --> 00:30:33.980
They will explain it
away, they will ignore it,

00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:36.820
they will in some other way discredit it

00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:41.750
because they already have
the true explanation.

00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:44.340
But this actually gets back

00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:49.340
to some very old traditions
within Christianity,

00:30:55.302 --> 00:30:58.330
well, without getting into too much detail

00:30:58.330 --> 00:31:00.700
in that although it's
an interesting topic,

00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:05.610
the creationists view science

00:31:05.610 --> 00:31:10.240
as producing truth but
the truth has to accord

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:13.770
with what they already believe is true

00:31:13.770 --> 00:31:18.200
and it is a weakness when
you change your explanation.

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:21.893
So they will criticize
evolution by saying, well,

00:31:23.370 --> 00:31:28.370
last year you said that
the big Australopithecines

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:31.640
and the little Australopithecines
were two separate species

00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:33.860
and now you're saying the same species.

00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:36.660
You guys are always changing
your mind about evolution.

00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:38.970
It's all a bunch of whole cloth.

00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:42.950
So changing your mind is a
structural weakness to them,

00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:45.900
whereas to us, it's a feature, not a bug.

00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:48.680
It's how we get closer to
an accurate explanation

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:50.860
of how the world works.

00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:53.823
- The media, in a way,

00:31:55.450 --> 00:32:00.110
in its effort to be fair, becomes unfair

00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:02.540
in the sense that I'm now thinking about

00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:09.100
news items on nutrition,
what's good for you to eat.

00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:11.230
Is coffee good for you
or is it bad for you?

00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:12.552
Is wine good for you?

00:32:12.552 --> 00:32:16.050
And part of this is
they're not understanding

00:32:16.050 --> 00:32:18.360
what you just described about science.

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:21.420
There's constant revision

00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:25.360
so that the structure
there would seem to help

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:28.420
in the process of delegitimating science,

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:31.170
not in reality, not in
science at its core,

00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:33.700
but what its adversaries
are saying against it.

00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:35.700
- You know, it's a double-edged sword.

00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:37.910
We want the media to cover science

00:32:37.910 --> 00:32:40.940
because that way the public
learns more about science.

00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:42.810
The public is very interested in science

00:32:42.810 --> 00:32:44.270
and wants to know more about science,

00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:47.110
and of course, the more public
understands about science,

00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:48.810
the more likely they are to support it

00:32:48.810 --> 00:32:53.110
and basically the public
does support science.

00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:55.380
I'm happy to say they think
more money should be spent

00:32:55.380 --> 00:33:00.190
on scientific research,
but simultaneously,

00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:01.557
so it's really great

00:33:01.557 --> 00:33:04.720
that the press covers new
scientific developments

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:07.100
but there's a lot of
stuff that's out there

00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:09.600
on that frontier, outside of that core.

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:11.340
There's a lot of stuff
that's still pretty iffy.

00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:13.480
We're still figuring it out.

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:16.360
What's the effect of
caffeine on heart disease?

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:18.330
What's the effect of caffeine

00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:20.360
on this kind of heart disease
versus that kinda heart?

00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:22.080
We don't really know yet,

00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:25.440
and so a study will come out saying A

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:27.370
and the press will report it.

00:33:27.370 --> 00:33:29.950
A study will come out six
months later saying B,

00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:30.920
the press will report it.

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:32.370
We want the press to report it,

00:33:32.370 --> 00:33:36.740
but the public can get
confused because it seems like

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:39.040
these scientists are
always changing their mind

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:40.870
like the creationists say.

00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:45.870
I think where the press could
help would be to make sure

00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:50.513
that they're communicating
the tentativeness of science.

00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:55.410
Study A has just been produced
and it has this conclusion.

00:33:55.410 --> 00:33:58.200
Generally speaking, if you
interview the scientists

00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:03.080
who wrote the paper, paper A of topic A,

00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:06.030
they will tell you, well,
these are preliminary findings.

00:34:06.030 --> 00:34:08.780
We think they're strong but
more work needs to be done.

00:34:09.730 --> 00:34:12.310
That often doesn't get
communicated to the public

00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:16.850
and there's a structural
problem here, frankly,

00:34:16.850 --> 00:34:21.850
because most of us in our daily
lives, we do like certainty.

00:34:23.110 --> 00:34:26.100
Uncertainty is unsettling
in some respects.

00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:28.110
Is the bus gonna come on time or not?

00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:30.500
There's a lot of little and big things

00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:32.927
that are uncertain in our lives,

00:34:32.927 --> 00:34:37.927
but any scientist has
to be very comfortable

00:34:37.970 --> 00:34:40.460
with saying I don't know yet,

00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:42.910
and I would always encourage
them to add the yet,

00:34:42.910 --> 00:34:44.780
because again, in terms of communicating

00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:46.480
with the public about science,

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:50.570
the public will pick up the
idea that if you don't know yet,

00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:52.250
that means you might know in the future.

00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:53.810
If you just say it's a mystery,

00:34:53.810 --> 00:34:56.630
people will think, oh, it's
unsolvable, which is different.

00:34:56.630 --> 00:34:58.780
So I don't know yet is something

00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:00.410
that scientists say all the time

00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:02.490
and we feel comfortable with.

00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:05.860
Being comfortable with
uncertainty is a distinction

00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:09.350
that you find more among
scientists than the general public.

00:35:09.350 --> 00:35:12.290
They get much more upset
with paper A saying

00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:15.850
caffeine affects heart
disease X in this way

00:35:15.850 --> 00:35:18.610
and then somebody coming up six
months later and saying, no,

00:35:18.610 --> 00:35:22.350
caffeine does not affect
heart disease X in that way.

00:35:22.350 --> 00:35:23.580
Well, who knows?

00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:25.060
We don't know yet.

00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:27.980
We just need to help
people understand that yet.

00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:32.070
- In your book, you have a
quote from Saint Augustine

00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:36.873
which I thought was very interesting.

00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:41.490
This is what Augustine
wrote, Saint Augustine.

00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:43.340
If they find a Christian mistaken

00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:46.800
in a field which they know
well, that is the people,

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:49.360
and hearing him maintaining
his foolish opinions

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:50.630
about the scriptures,

00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:53.330
how then are they going to
believe those scriptures

00:35:53.330 --> 00:35:56.410
in matters concerning the
resurrection of the dead,

00:35:56.410 --> 00:35:58.990
the hope of eternal life
and the kingdom of heaven,

00:35:58.990 --> 00:36:02.880
how indeed when they
think their pages are full

00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:07.030
of falsehoods on facts which
they themselves have learned

00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:09.440
from experience in the light of reason?

00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:14.440
So he's really warning the
advocates of Christianity

00:36:15.370 --> 00:36:18.560
that you can't touch people's,

00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:21.590
what they know from everyday experience.

00:36:21.590 --> 00:36:23.010
- What he's saying there

00:36:23.010 --> 00:36:25.870
is don't interpret the Bible literally.

00:36:25.870 --> 00:36:28.883
And this was Augustine,
that was a long time ago.

00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:33.460
Biblical literalism is a
relatively recent development

00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:35.590
in Christian theology.

00:36:35.590 --> 00:36:38.150
I think that's also a
very well-kept secret

00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:41.080
in this whole controversy,
that interpreting the Bible

00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:43.683
as six 24-hour days is fairly recent.

00:36:45.450 --> 00:36:47.180
There's a little background radiation

00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:48.470
all through Christian history,

00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:53.060
but most Christian
theologians since Augustine

00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:54.870
have not been biblically literalist.

00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:59.210
Biblical literalism
came about as a product

00:36:59.210 --> 00:37:01.080
of the fundamentalist movement

00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:03.470
which was an early 20th century movement.

00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:05.920
This was not a movement that is back

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:08.400
in the 800s or something like that.

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:11.740
This is a movement to refine
Protestant Christianity

00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:15.100
that came about in the 19 teens and 1920s.

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:16.530
So it's a pretty recent,

00:37:16.530 --> 00:37:18.720
as Christianity's been
around for a long time.

00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:20.160
It's a pretty recent movement,

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:22.500
and it's been very
popular in North America

00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:25.640
but it's not especially popular in Europe

00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:28.830
and in some other parts of the world.

00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:30.980
- It's funny, as you're speaking,

00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:34.220
what comes to my mind is the literalists

00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:35.818
interpreting the Constitution.

00:37:35.818 --> 00:37:37.688
(Eugenie laughing)

00:37:37.688 --> 00:37:38.660
- [Eugenie] You're a
political scientist, are you?

00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:39.740
- Yeah.
- Yeah. (laughs)

00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:40.860
- There's a study--
- Comes by it naturally.

00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:43.830
- You in your book which
I heartily recommend,

00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:48.653
I should show it, Evolution
Versus Creationism.

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:50.670
- Second edition. (laughs)

00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:53.473
- Second edition published by UC Press.

00:37:54.587 --> 00:37:56.660
You look at the Scopes Trial.

00:37:56.660 --> 00:37:57.820
You go through that history

00:37:57.820 --> 00:38:00.380
'cause history is this bigger picture

00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:05.380
which you're very attuned
to, and to summarize briefly,

00:38:06.070 --> 00:38:09.480
there were three changes that occurred

00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:11.540
in the environment at the time of Scopes.

00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:15.990
One was the rise of fundamentalism
which you just discussed.

00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:19.640
The second thing was the
importance of secondary education.

00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:23.610
The numbers were really increasing there

00:38:23.610 --> 00:38:28.130
and the third factor is
escaping me right now

00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:31.570
but there was another historical factor--

00:38:31.570 --> 00:38:33.200
- [Eugenie] Oh, well, World War One.

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:36.160
- Yeah, World War One, that's right,

00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:39.210
and the whole discrediting

00:38:39.210 --> 00:38:41.650
of the survival of the fittest notion.

00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:46.650
So this was a classic battle
which was won indirectly

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:52.920
by the evolutionists, but
then in the aftermath of that,

00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:57.130
evolution wasn't put in
the texts, so therefore--

00:38:57.130 --> 00:38:58.667
- In fact it was taken out of the texts.

00:38:58.667 --> 00:38:59.550
- Texts, yeah.

00:38:59.550 --> 00:39:02.490
- There was more evolution before Scopes,

00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:04.630
more evolution in
textbooks in the curriculum

00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:06.020
before Scopes than after.

00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:09.890
- And so ironically the court victory

00:39:09.890 --> 00:39:12.630
didn't have the positive repercussions

00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:17.070
but then evolution in this
conflict with the creationists

00:39:17.070 --> 00:39:20.553
comes back when we have the
Space Race in the 1950s.

00:39:22.830 --> 00:39:25.500
The importance of what
you're saying here is

00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:29.670
the broader environment,
the social context,

00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:34.670
the political history is very important

00:39:34.970 --> 00:39:38.500
for the ups and downs of this controversy.

00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:42.783
- Yeah, absolutely, that
summarizes the history very nicely.

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:46.760
Anti-evolutionism has been a sine wave.

00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:50.263
It's waxed and waned over time. (sighs)

00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:53.670
Like I was saying a moment ago,

00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:57.870
before the Scopes Trial at
the turn of the century,

00:39:57.870 --> 00:39:59.160
you can find textbooks

00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:01.490
that talk about this relatively new idea.

00:40:01.490 --> 00:40:04.140
It's only 50, 60 years
old from Charles Darwin

00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:06.150
that living things have common ancestors

00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:08.800
and here's this explanation
of natural selection

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:11.640
for how it works, and this
is new science and so forth,

00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:13.993
and it was assumed in the textbooks.

00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:19.330
When more and more kids
started going to school,

00:40:19.330 --> 00:40:22.830
the number of kids in secondary school,

00:40:22.830 --> 00:40:24.770
generally speaking at
the turn of the century

00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:25.760
if you got to eighth grade

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:27.720
you were well-educated and that was it.

00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:30.450
But with high school
becoming much more common,

00:40:30.450 --> 00:40:33.950
and urbanization, more
people were being exposed

00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:36.560
to these textbooks and
with the creationist,

00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:38.900
excuse me, with the
fundamentalist movement

00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:42.480
and the biblical literalist
kind of theology being pushed,

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:46.260
there was a conflict, so
evolution was taken out

00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:50.470
of the textbooks again and
stayed out until the 1960s

00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:55.150
when, because of the scare

00:40:55.150 --> 00:40:57.950
of the Russians getting to space first,

00:40:57.950 --> 00:41:00.400
the National Science Foundation

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:03.370
started funding science education

00:41:03.370 --> 00:41:06.620
including the publication
of textbooks written

00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:08.980
by scientists in biology, geology,

00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:12.410
physics, and earth science,

00:41:12.410 --> 00:41:13.930
and the biology textbooks,

00:41:13.930 --> 00:41:15.020
because they were written

00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:17.410
by practicing university scientists

00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:19.640
and master teachers, included evolution.

00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:24.640
So evolution got into the curriculum again

00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:29.020
which generated opposition
from the creationists

00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:30.500
'cause they didn't have to worry

00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:34.610
between about 1930 and about 1965.

00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:37.270
They didn't have to worry
about evolution being taught

00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:38.760
'cause it wasn't being taught,

00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:40.220
but once it started being taught,

00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:43.640
again, that ramped up the
anti-evolution movement.

00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:46.250
And eventually the equal-time laws

00:41:46.250 --> 00:41:48.620
of the late '70s started being proposed

00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:50.640
where you had to balance evolution

00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:53.640
by the teaching of creation
science which they had invented.

00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:58.010
And so evolution started going
out of the textbooks again.

00:41:58.010 --> 00:42:00.420
We fought to put it back in in the '80s

00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:02.860
and that plus some court decisions

00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:06.510
generated the intelligent
design movement, so, you know,

00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:09.020
if it's not one damn thing,
it's another. (laughs)

00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:12.830
- You also, in your book,
have an interesting discussion

00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:16.530
of essentially myth, and of the notion,

00:42:16.530 --> 00:42:19.500
and myth being the ideas that are central

00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:24.500
to a society or a nation, and in a way,

00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:30.310
some of the myths come
from the way people live,

00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:32.970
the social experience of their lives,

00:42:32.970 --> 00:42:35.220
and you pointed out that the school,

00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:40.220
the history of the schools being
a decentralized enterprise,

00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:42.980
you talked about, as are the churches.

00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:45.693
And so you got local control,

00:42:48.210 --> 00:42:51.890
which means that all the battles

00:42:51.890 --> 00:42:55.050
are often in a decentralized area,

00:42:55.050 --> 00:42:59.793
as you discussed in your
first awakening to this.

00:43:01.570 --> 00:43:04.230
It seems, so this is what
I wanna to pose to you,

00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:09.230
which is the progressive
agenda really often comes

00:43:09.350 --> 00:43:12.810
from a center at the national level,

00:43:12.810 --> 00:43:17.810
whereas then the fight
emerges with the local level,

00:43:19.370 --> 00:43:24.370
which embraces some of the non-scientific

00:43:27.809 --> 00:43:29.420
ways of looking at things.

00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:32.150
Talk a little about that, is that unfair?

00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:34.163
- Well, (sighs)

00:43:35.530 --> 00:43:36.440
it's a push me pull you kinda thing,

00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:38.790
yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:43:38.790 --> 00:43:42.230
- Education is highly decentralized.

00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:44.330
Decisions about what gets taught,

00:43:44.330 --> 00:43:46.120
who's gonna teach, how
much you're gonna pay,

00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:48.190
those are all local decisions.

00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:51.230
To some degree in the last 20 years,

00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:53.690
the focus has shifted a
little bit more to the state

00:43:53.690 --> 00:43:55.490
partly for funding reasons.

00:43:55.490 --> 00:43:58.530
If the state is gonna give
money to the local districts,

00:43:58.530 --> 00:44:00.280
they can tie strings to it

00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:05.015
so there may be some curricular pressures

00:44:05.015 --> 00:44:06.760
on local districts, but really,

00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:09.550
a local district can decide
to thumb its nose at the state

00:44:09.550 --> 00:44:11.273
and teach any damn thing it wants,

00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:15.630
within constitutional (laughs) reason.

00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:17.980
You can't teach the violent
overthrow of the government.

00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:20.360
That's treason, so they're
not gonna teach that.

00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:23.400
But the decentralization
is really important

00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:28.400
in American education, and so as a result,

00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:31.930
when evolution creeps
back into the textbooks

00:44:31.930 --> 00:44:36.830
and people on the local level
notice, this tends to support

00:44:36.830 --> 00:44:39.643
national anti-evolutionist organizations.

00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:44.320
The Institute for Creation Research

00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:46.770
and later Answers in
Genesis and a whole raft

00:44:46.770 --> 00:44:49.760
of small anti-evolutionist organizations

00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:51.960
have sprung up at different times.

00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:55.433
The IC are being the most
important in terms of my work,

00:44:56.300 --> 00:45:00.460
and they are very influential

00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:03.630
'cause they're sort of
our evil twin. (laughs)

00:45:03.630 --> 00:45:05.590
Somebody's gonna quote
me on that, I know it,

00:45:05.590 --> 00:45:08.840
but they provide information
for their grassroots people

00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:11.270
just like NCSE provides information

00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:14.230
for grassroots people on
our side of this issue

00:45:14.230 --> 00:45:16.700
to better persuade decision-makers

00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:18.470
at the local and state level.
- We can't say they're evil.

00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:19.490
- No, yeah.
- They're just the opposite

00:45:19.490 --> 00:45:22.440
side, yeah, okay, we'll just, yeah, yeah.

00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:24.540
- It's a joke about the evil twin

00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:26.990
'cause that's a cultural motif, but yeah.

00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:28.800
But it's like the black and the white,

00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:31.530
it's like the yin and yang.

00:45:31.530 --> 00:45:35.460
The national organizations
provide information

00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:37.820
to the grassroots but
if it doesn't get done

00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:39.770
at the grassroots, it doesn't get done.

00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:44.690
People always ask me, oh,
with the new administration,

00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:46.680
or now that that administration is gone,

00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:48.660
it's gonna be easier,
it's gonna be harder.

00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:52.010
The federal government has hardly anything

00:45:52.010 --> 00:45:53.740
to do with curriculum,

00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:56.860
and whether evolution is taught
or not is a curricular issue

00:45:56.860 --> 00:46:01.110
and curriculum is determined
at the state and local level,

00:46:01.110 --> 00:46:04.060
so regardless of what somebody

00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:08.160
in a given administration
believes about creationism,

00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:10.460
they're not gonna be able
to do a heck of a lot

00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:14.120
to see that when the
classroom door gets shut

00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:15.530
in Mrs. Brown's classroom,

00:46:15.530 --> 00:46:18.130
she's gonna pull out the
creation science materials.

00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:23.090
There also has been a legal
history of the battles

00:46:23.090 --> 00:46:25.743
between evolution and anti-evolution for,

00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:29.743
well, let's see now, for almost 100 years.

00:46:31.310 --> 00:46:34.470
That is very relevant to this
whole controversy as well.

00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:37.820
But just in terms of
the national grassroots,

00:46:37.820 --> 00:46:41.343
decentralization, versus local control,

00:46:42.770 --> 00:46:44.430
it's a combination of factors.

00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:49.170
But the NCSE would not have
been able to accomplish

00:46:49.170 --> 00:46:52.980
as much as it's accomplished
over the years of our existence

00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:55.630
if it hadn't been for people
at the grassroots willing

00:46:55.630 --> 00:46:58.950
to take the time and spend the energy

00:46:58.950 --> 00:47:02.660
and tremendous amount of
effort in trying to see

00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:05.090
that good science gets
taught in their schools.

00:47:05.090 --> 00:47:06.480
- As we see in the world today,

00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:10.080
let's talk about today
and we see a movement

00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:15.080
across the globe toward
authoritarianism in various degrees.

00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:20.210
Some might even speculate
about that movement here

00:47:20.210 --> 00:47:21.290
in the United States.

00:47:21.290 --> 00:47:26.247
And authoritarian demagogic leaders

00:47:27.370 --> 00:47:30.170
basically often built their

00:47:32.660 --> 00:47:37.660
platform on fear, anxiety,

00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:41.083
untruths, shall we call them, if not lies.

00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:46.960
Do you see this as a more
precarious environment

00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:50.170
as things evolve in this direction

00:47:50.170 --> 00:47:52.650
in terms of the battles you're fighting?

00:47:52.650 --> 00:47:54.080
Well, just as a citizen,

00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:56.913
I'm very concerned with
these kinds of pressures.

00:47:58.343 --> 00:48:00.460
It is something that I
think all citizens ought

00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:01.610
to be concerned about.

00:48:01.610 --> 00:48:04.520
In terms specifically of the
creation and evolution issue

00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:08.430
I think it's less closely related

00:48:08.430 --> 00:48:12.360
simply because of the
grassroots orientation

00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:15.510
and the fact that it is
not a constant thing.

00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:18.750
Where you find controversies arising

00:48:18.750 --> 00:48:22.990
over the teaching of
evolution occur at intervals,

00:48:22.990 --> 00:48:25.630
every six or seven or however many years

00:48:25.630 --> 00:48:27.970
in a given state or district.

00:48:27.970 --> 00:48:30.070
The science curriculum will be examined

00:48:30.070 --> 00:48:31.990
and the next year they'll
look at the math curriculum

00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:33.210
and the year after that they'll look

00:48:33.210 --> 00:48:34.870
at the English language arts,

00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:38.270
but at regular five to
seven years, generally,

00:48:38.270 --> 00:48:40.920
they'll take a look at
the science curriculum

00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:44.100
and that's when
anti-evolutionism may appear.

00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:46.580
Right now as we're talking,

00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:48.500
there's a problem in the state of Arizona

00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:51.110
over the adoption of
state evolution standards

00:48:51.110 --> 00:48:56.110
where the Board of Education
has tinkered around

00:48:57.140 --> 00:49:00.970
with the coverage of
climate change and evolution

00:49:00.970 --> 00:49:02.360
in a way that is not good,

00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:05.333
and so citizens are
pushing back against that.

00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:09.140
But you talked about anxieties.

00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:12.283
I think there are anxieties
that people have but they're,

00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:16.730
fascism functions much better

00:49:16.730 --> 00:49:18.870
the more diffused the anxieties are.

00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:21.720
If you are very precise
about your anxieties,

00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:23.030
you can be disproved,

00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:26.160
so it's always better to have
just sort of a general haze

00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:29.110
of anxiety out there and
you're gonna be more successful

00:49:29.110 --> 00:49:34.110
at imposing your undemocratic views.

00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:36.990
I don't think the creationism issue

00:49:36.990 --> 00:49:39.140
fits into that quite as well.

00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:44.140
It may be a secondary component
if there is an upsurge

00:49:45.310 --> 00:49:50.310
of more conservative
forms of Christianity,

00:49:50.490 --> 00:49:53.500
but conservative Christianity
is not monolithic

00:49:57.052 --> 00:49:59.880
in terms of the kinds of political views

00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:02.030
that you were talking about.

00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:06.060
There are quite a few green Christians,

00:50:06.060 --> 00:50:07.820
environmentally-oriented Christians

00:50:07.820 --> 00:50:10.290
who really believe in stewardship theology

00:50:10.290 --> 00:50:13.860
and it's their job to
reduce the amount of carbon.

00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:15.540
Climate change is a big problem.

00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:17.580
We have to do this, that, and the other.

00:50:17.580 --> 00:50:19.750
There are a lot of
social justice Christians

00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:22.320
who are very concerned about
things like immigration

00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:24.450
because we are our brother's keeper.

00:50:24.450 --> 00:50:27.910
They have biblical and
theological reasons for

00:50:31.030 --> 00:50:35.230
resisting some of the
anti-immigration statutes

00:50:35.230 --> 00:50:38.440
and so forth that may be on the way.

00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:42.950
So even if conservative
religious views are

00:50:45.310 --> 00:50:50.310
encouraged by those who
are perhaps not reflecting

00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:54.458
what I would consider
the best American values,

00:50:54.458 --> 00:50:58.300
it doesn't mean that that is
going to necessarily result

00:50:58.300 --> 00:51:01.105
in an increase in anti-evolutionism

00:51:01.105 --> 00:51:01.938
which is a long-winded answer

00:51:01.938 --> 00:51:03.180
to your question.
- But in a way

00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:05.840
you're suggesting that it's not inevitable

00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:09.470
that there's a spillover
from the evolution debate

00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:11.290
to the climate change debate.

00:51:11.290 --> 00:51:13.910
In other words, they're different actors

00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:18.910
but the one variable here is inequality,

00:51:19.010 --> 00:51:23.550
economic inequality, and
the funding of opposition,

00:51:23.550 --> 00:51:26.650
for example, to climate change.

00:51:26.650 --> 00:51:28.610
Is that something we need to worry about

00:51:28.610 --> 00:51:31.670
or is it really a strategy,

00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:33.080
what you need is a strategy

00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:38.080
of not lumping these
things together if you--

00:51:38.690 --> 00:51:40.530
- I think they're independent enough.

00:51:40.530 --> 00:51:44.620
There's a small overlap but it's focusing

00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:46.060
on that smallish overlap

00:51:46.060 --> 00:51:49.020
is probably not gonna be
the best use of resources.

00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:52.690
- Even though climate change deniers

00:51:52.690 --> 00:51:56.870
are anti-science in a way?

00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:59.750
- I don't think that they
would consider themselves that.

00:51:59.750 --> 00:52:00.610
- [Harry] I see.

00:52:00.610 --> 00:52:03.133
- I think that the people who'd, okay,

00:52:03.133 --> 00:52:05.830
they're not anti-science generically.

00:52:05.830 --> 00:52:09.060
They may be anti the
research done in this field

00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:12.120
and I've been talking to scientists

00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:14.160
on campus the last couple
of days during my visit

00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:17.110
which is always a very pleasant
part of a visit like this

00:52:17.110 --> 00:52:20.040
and I was talking to one professor.

00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:22.153
He was saying, well, you know,

00:52:22.153 --> 00:52:26.530
the evolution issue is
much more straightforward

00:52:26.530 --> 00:52:28.140
than the climate change issue

00:52:28.140 --> 00:52:31.150
in that evolution has just been so

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:34.460
strongly established.

00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:36.120
Living things have common ancestors.

00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:38.790
That is the only explanation
that explains biology

00:52:38.790 --> 00:52:40.630
as we know it today, and we know a lot

00:52:40.630 --> 00:52:42.920
about the mechanisms and
genetics and so forth.

00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:45.110
With climate change, there are some things

00:52:45.110 --> 00:52:46.850
that we are absolutely positive about.

00:52:46.850 --> 00:52:50.510
There are core ideas of
climate change as well.

00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:53.640
CO2 and methane are warming
gases, we know that.

00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:55.760
We know that they have increased.

00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:59.290
The inference is very
clear that the increase

00:52:59.290 --> 00:53:01.480
in warming gases has
increased the temperature

00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:04.890
of the planet very rapidly
over this short period of time.

00:53:04.890 --> 00:53:09.730
Modeling is something that is
extraordinarily complicated

00:53:09.730 --> 00:53:12.620
and that scientists will disagree on,

00:53:12.620 --> 00:53:15.470
and scientific disagreement

00:53:15.470 --> 00:53:17.450
is the bread and butter of science.

00:53:17.450 --> 00:53:18.960
There's nothing wrong with that,

00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:20.790
and scientists will sometimes

00:53:20.790 --> 00:53:23.270
have exceedingly vigorous conversations

00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:25.060
and arguments about who's right,

00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:29.900
and eventually a consensus
is going to emerge

00:53:29.900 --> 00:53:33.470
but when you're saying this model shows

00:53:33.470 --> 00:53:38.310
that in 15 years the ocean is
going to be raised three feet

00:53:38.310 --> 00:53:39.810
and somebody else says, okay,

00:53:39.810 --> 00:53:42.420
but your model is wrong in
here, here, and here and here,

00:53:42.420 --> 00:53:46.193
and my model shows that the
ocean will be up six feet.

00:53:48.210 --> 00:53:51.450
That is likely a legitimate
scientific controversy.

00:53:51.450 --> 00:53:55.100
For we laymen, in terms of the
climate change controversy,

00:53:55.100 --> 00:53:57.380
the important thing is, dang,

00:53:57.380 --> 00:53:59.500
the ocean's really gonna be raising a lot.

00:53:59.500 --> 00:54:01.510
We gotta do something about this.

00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:03.270
Splitting hairs over
whether it's three feet

00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:06.580
or six feet may not be the
big worry we should have,

00:54:06.580 --> 00:54:08.370
but people who are against the idea

00:54:08.370 --> 00:54:10.980
of anthropogenic climate change

00:54:10.980 --> 00:54:13.300
are usually attacking that kind of thing

00:54:13.300 --> 00:54:18.220
rather than the basic
physics behind warming gases

00:54:18.220 --> 00:54:20.150
and their effect on the planet.

00:54:20.150 --> 00:54:23.430
- Well, Eugenie, I wanna
thank you very much

00:54:23.430 --> 00:54:26.350
for coming to Berkeley
as the Hitchcock Lecture

00:54:26.350 --> 00:54:30.190
and taking time in that
visit to be on our program

00:54:30.190 --> 00:54:32.880
and I would like to show your book again,

00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:36.550
Evolution Versus Creationism,

00:54:36.550 --> 00:54:40.220
and it's quite a good
read for somebody wanting

00:54:42.260 --> 00:54:45.200
to learn more about that debate

00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:47.900
which you've played
such an active part in.

00:54:47.900 --> 00:54:50.030
Thank you very much
for being here with us,

00:54:50.030 --> 00:54:51.350
thank you.
- Thank you for inviting me.

00:54:51.350 --> 00:54:54.110
- And thank you very much for joining us

00:54:54.110 --> 00:54:56.620
for this Conversation with History.

00:54:56.620 --> 00:55:00.453
