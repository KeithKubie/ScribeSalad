00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.220
&gt;&gt; Robert Newlen: Good
evening, everyone.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.890
My name is Robert Newlen.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.650
I'm Deputy Librarian of Congress.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.230
And on behalf of the Librarian
of Congress, Dr. Carla Hayden,

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.660
it's my pleasure to welcome
you to the Library of Congress.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.120
I'm so glad to see so many of you
here tonight for the presentation

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:47.410
of the 2016 Rebekah Johnson
Bobbitt National Prize for Poetry.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.190
Before we begin, I'd like to note
that we are recording this event

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.620
for the Library's archive, and
for all to see on our website,

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.800
and would ask that you please
silence your cell phones

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.430
and any other electronics
you may have with you.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.720
The Bobbitt Prize is
awarded every other year

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.440 position:56%
to recognize the most
distinguished book of poetry written

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.080
by an American poet
over the last two years,

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.710
or the Lifetime Achievement
of an American poet.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.300
With so many great
poets working today,

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.520
that's really no easy distinction.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.780
We are indebted to the jurors who
read through over 120 submissions

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.450
from publishers large and
small, for this year's Prize.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.990
Betty Sue Flowers, former
director of the LBJ Library Museum,

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.610
an emeritus professor of English at
the University of Texas at Austin,

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.790
has anchored the panel
for many years

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.940
as the Bobbitt family
representative.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.120
Boston poet laureate,
Danielle George,

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.730
was selected by our own poet
laureate, Juan Felipe Herrera,

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.030 position:56%
and the Librarian of Congress
selected national book award winning

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.500
poet, Mary Szybist.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.150
To all future jurors, we thank
them for their hard work.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.980
I would also like to
acknowledge the publishers

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:12.260
of this year's co-winners,
Graywolf Press,

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.270
and New Directions Publishing,

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.100
two of the nation's
powerhouse independents.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.430 position:56%
And finally, thank you to Dr. Philip
C. Bobbitt for his generous gift

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.940
that makes this Prize possible.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.240
Professor Bobbitt is one

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.500
of the nation's leading
constitutional theorists,

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.360
the Herbert Wechsler professor,
a federal jurist prudence,

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.910
and director for the
Center for National Security

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.550
at Columbia Law School, a
distinguished senior lecturer

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.850
at the University of Texas, and
most importantly for us tonight,

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.320
his parents shared
a strong connection

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.550
to this wonderful institution.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.390
To tell us more about
that, please join me

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.510
in welcoming Philip to the stage.

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:04.510
[ Applause ]

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:10.190
[ Background Sounds ]

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.210
&gt;&gt; Philip Bobbitt: It's been my
great pleasure these last almost

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.930
three decades to say something at
these gatherings about my family,

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:24.000 position:56%
and especially about my mother, in
whose honor this Prize is presented,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.320
Becky Johnson of Johnson City, and
she was when she met my father here

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.250
at the Library of Congress,
in the 1930s.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.620
My parent's story is
a Washington story.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.050
Here they fell in love
during the Depression;

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.930
here they reluctantly
left when the War began.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.580
My mother didn't really
want to leave Washington.

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.440
One of her suitors had bribed the
orchestra leader at the showroom

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.700
to play "The Yellow Rose of Texas"
whenever she came to the ballroom.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.550
She wasn't going to get
anything like that in Austin.

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.650
She had, in fact, escaped Texas.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.500
And I don't think she really
wanted to marry a man from Texas.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.240
But they eloped to Mexico, they
lived together mainly in Texas

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:14.070
for 38 years until
my mother's death.

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.880
When she died, I found a cache
of some unusual index cards

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.490
in a pigeonhole in the
small green writing desk

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.880
where she did her correspondence
every day.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.120
Each card had a hole drilled
in the center of the top line,

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.350
and on each was typed poetry or in
some cases a rather lofty saying.

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:39.540
I took them from my father, and I
said, "What are all these cards?"

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.800
I mean, there were dozens of them.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.360
He said, "You remember that I
met your mother at the Library

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.080
of Congress when we were both
working our way through school."

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.720
My father had won a scholarship to
come to East to college from Texas.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.490
My mother was studying library
science, as it was called then.

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.160
My father said to me, "You know
that your mother was engaged

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.320
to another man when we first met."

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.510
I said, "Yes; I sort
of remembered -- "

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:19.070
[ Non-Topic Comments ]

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.100
I said, "Yes; I do
sort of remember that,

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.060
a Princeton graduate," I thought.

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.710
"Well, I had to dislodge
this fellow,

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.110
but the only time I ever
saw your mother was at work.

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.530 position:56%
And we had a very strict supervisor.

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:32.830
We worked in cataloguing.

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.970
And those cards are from
the card catalogues."

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:38.270
I mean, that explained the holes.

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.690
They really in fact belonged
in the bottom of the card.

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:43.870
"And we would exchange
notes as if we were typing

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.890
in reference information."

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:49.210
[Laughter] I've always
had a certain affection

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.930
for the Dewey Decimal System,
since I heard that story.

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.260 position:56%
Anyway, my father and I sat and we
talked, and out of that conversation

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:01.370 position:56%
that afternoon, came the idea of the
Poetry Prize here at the Library;

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:05.070
a Prize, which is now
in its 27th year.

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:08.420
Twenty-seven years ago, my
father and I came to the Library

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:11.900
of Congress, with a
librarian, and the poet laureate

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.430
to honor James Merrill,
the first recipient

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.310
of the Rebekah Johnson
Bobbitt Prize.

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:23.840
If the function of poetry
is not to inform, but evoke,

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.820 position:56%
as the classicists tell us,
perhaps you will recognize something

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.650
in the following short poem by
James Merrill, something other

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:34.590
than the [inaudible],
which you'll all recognize,

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:37.690
something of the season
that has just passed,

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:40.590
and perhaps lingers
still in this town.

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:42.830
It's called "Snow Jobs."

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:49.590
"X had the funds, the
friends, the plan.

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:54.490
Wise Frank Grin [phonetic]
was our common fate,

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:57.600
or really just a flash in pan.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:02.990
Z from the tender age of eight,
had thirsted to officiate.

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:04.290
We hardly felt him disappear.

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.830
The crooked and the X had the
funds, the friends, the plan.

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:08.570
The crooked and the
somewhat straight.

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:12.120
Now, where's the slush
of yesteryear?

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.420
[Laughter] Where's Teapot Dome?

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:16.070
Where's the Iran Contra Affair?

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:17.800
Where's Watergate?

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.950
Liddy, Magruder, Ehrlichman, their
shoes squeaked down the Halls

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:26.270
of State, whole networks
groaned beneath their weight.

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:31.320
Until spinster Clotho darted near
to shroud in white a running mate.

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:34.610 position:56%
Ah, where's the slush of yesteryear?

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:37.310
Like blizzards on a screen
the scandals thickened

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:41.420
at a fearful rate, followed
by laughter from a can,

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:44.720
and hot air from the candidate.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.510
With so much open to
debate, language that went

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:51.630
in one ear came out, "Oh,
well, hush, be delicate."

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:55.790
Where is the slush of yesteryear?

00:07:55.790 --> 00:08:00.990
Omniscient host, throughout your
great late shows the crystal wits

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:04.540
cohere, the flaky banks accumulate.

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:07.340
But where's the slush
of yesteryear?"

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:10.480
Well, that's from Jimmy Merrill.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.740
Depending on how you count,
this is either the 14th

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:15.620
or the 16th Prize to be awarded.

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.760
That's because tonight,
as only once before,

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.090
the Library is also
awarding a Bobbitt Prize

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:23.350
for Lifetime Achievement in Poetry.

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:26.080
So I thought I might just close
by saying something about how

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.880
that particular P Prize came about.

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:32.670
The members of my family have
never been, and should not be,

00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:36.170
involved in the selection of
the winners for this Prize.

00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:39.730
We're not poets, we're
critics, or editors of poetry.

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:44.240
And besides, the juries that have
selected past winners have done

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:46.030
pretty damned well.

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:50.660
Merrill, Glick, Strands, Ammons,
Colt, Bedard, Ferry, Fulton,

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:56.640
Fairchild, Merwin, Wright, Hicok,
Perillo, Smith, Stern, what a list.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:00.250
Robert Pinsky, our three-time
poet laureate said, and I quote,

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:05.150
"No other literary prize has set
such a high standard," end quote.

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:08.110
And this year's winner,
Claudia Rankine,

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:11.140
rightly joins this
remarkable collegiate.

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:17.310 position:56%
Of her work, "Citizen," one will not
hear what a witty critic once said

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:21.790 position:56%
of another long poem, "This book
will be read when every other volume

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:24.630
of poetry published this
year has long been forgotten,

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:26.990
but not until then."

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:31.510
[Laughter] For in fact "Citizen"
has been a smash success.

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:34.950
Nevertheless, there were
poets whose work we loved

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:40.040 position:56%
and hoped would be recognized with
the Prize given in my mother's name.

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.980
Howard Nemerov is one.

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:44.990
But he died shortly after
the Prize was inaugurated.

00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:46.290
[Inaudible] was another.

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:50.250
And he died, also without
ever having one.

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:53.740
I discussed the matter with some
of the persons here at the Library

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:56.740
who were familiar with
the selection process.

00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:59.490
[Inaudible] may be one of them.

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:03.310
Well, they told me,
"The person chosen

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:05.710
for the Bobbitt Prize has produced
the most distinguished work

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:07.790
in the last two years.

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:11.650
Those poets whose work you love,
Philip, may not have done that.

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:14.190
Some of them may not
even be writing now."

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:16.630
So for reason it was
decided to create a Prize

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:18.330
for Lifetime Achievement.

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:21.330
Naturally, I assume as
we go to an older person,

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:24.510
by which I mean older than I am.

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:27.460
[Laughter] I was the only child
of somewhat older parents,

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:30.790
the youngest grandchild
in my family.

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:33.570
Being a bright boy, much
brighter than I am now,

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:40.340 position:56%
I was always the youngest in my
class, in my schools, in my college.

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:44.130
One consequence of this was
that I've unconsciously assumed

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:47.750
that at any gathering, I
will be the youngest person.

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:51.360
[Laughter] It's not that I thought
of myself as particularly young,

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:54.700
I just thought of everyone
else around my age as older.

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:57.760
So imagine my shock to
realize that the winner

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:01.690
of the Lifetime Achievement Award
is a fellow I went to college with.

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:04.790
But you don't win the
[inaudible] 27, do you?

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:09.990 position:56%
Nathaniel Mackey would have been 27
at the same time I finished clerking

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:13.650
and moved back to Austin to live
with my parents, in a large house

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:16.910
and take up a professorship
at the University at Austin.

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:19.290
We were a very close family.

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:23.700
But none of us knew how little
time we three would have together.

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:30.590
Or were there four; for I haven't
mentioned my beloved Mary Lewis.

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:33.660
One ought to be circumspect
in discussing the suffering

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:35.310
and oppression of others.

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:37.010
Never looks the same
from the outside,

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:42.100
whether it's an ear
ache, or a racist remark.

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:45.840
American slaves were not settlers,
and they were not immigrants.

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.730
They were brought to this
continent in chains, and maintained

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:51.380
in their condition as chattels.

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:56.040
But that does not change
the fact so often ignored

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:58.320
that the US would not have thrived,

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:02.100
would not even have successfully
managed its independence

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:04.940
without the African Americans
who came here against their will.

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:09.950
I don't know all that we owe
those original generations

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:13.190
of African Americans and
therefore owe their descendants,

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:14.810
or even the best way
for us to discharge

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:17.430
that obligation if I did know.

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:22.480
But I know this, that African
Americans have always had a right

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:26.480
to be here, that they have
in Sam Houston's words,

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:28.540 position:56%
"Watered the soil with their blood."

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:32.420
And it is a source
of some dismay to me

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:35.310
that many don't feel fully
invested in this country,

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:38.430
don't feel that it is
properly and rightfully theirs,

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:41.370
not just as a matter of equality,
but as a matter of birthright.

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:44.230
Mary Lewis came to work

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:46.330
for my family a few
months before I was born.

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:52.950
I was a large, lazy baby, and my
mother was tall but not strong.

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:55.650
So she was there every
day and many nights.

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:59.560
She traveled with us and
toted me around the world.

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:02.940
In the end, she stayed
with us for over 40 years.

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:05.160
I talked to her daughter yesterday.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.120
And although we were very close,

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.750
it wasn't because of
me that she stayed.

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:13.480
It was because of the bonds
she had forged with my mother.

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:16.640
Now, my mother was a woman
of her time and place.

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:18.460
She was no egalitarian.

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:23.750
And I think she disapproved of most
people's behavior, white or black.

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:26.080
[Laughter] But she was
close to Mary Lewis

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:27.510
in a way that's hard to describe.

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:31.330
It has something to do with
there being women in a world

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:35.650
of headstrong men, and something
also with their shared love

00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:37.490
of patellio [phonetic] and style.

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:40.690
We know from antiquity of the birth

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:43.480
of a society comes
in crime and pain.

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:46.130
Think of "The Rape of the
Sabine Women," for example.

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:50.700
But whatever our desperate origins,
we have created an enduring society

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:53.970
when so many others have failed.

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:58.700
We should take pride in our
endurance; and not only endurance,

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:04.520
but that we have prevailed, all
of us, one nation out of many,

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:09.750
under God, still seeking
liberty and justice for all.

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:14.220
Our little daughter is
about 27 months old.

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:16.140
She is the eighth Rebekah
in our family,

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:19.280
named for the woman
this Prize commemorates.

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:23.950
What sort of past will she reflect
on when she and her brother stand

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:27.500
where I'm standing to present
this Prize 27 years from now?

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:31.750
Like a physicist, I'm an optimist,

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:35.790
by which mean I think
the future is uncertain.

00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:37.590
Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Robert Newlen: Thank you, Philip,

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:54.070
for supporting the Library's
tradition of honoring poetry

00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:56.960
with this prize in
your mother's name.

00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:02.100
In 2008 the Bobbitt Prize was split
between Bob Hicok for his book,

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:06.080
"The Clumsy Living," and future
poet laureate Charles Wright

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:08.010
for his lifetime achievement.

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:12.950
This was the first time the
Prize honored both categories,

00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:15.530
and now nearly a decade later,

00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:19.020
a pair of poets merit
this recognition again.

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:24.250
I am pleased tonight to award
the 2016 Rebekah Johnson Bobbitt

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:29.330 position:56%
National Prize for Poetry to Claudia
Rankine for her book, "Citizen,"

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:32.510
and to Nathaniel Mackey
for Lifetime Achievement.

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:43.720
[ Applause ]

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:47.920
In complementary ways, both of
our winners argue for poetry

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:52.490 position:56%
as an essential way to invent
myths, and interrogate institutions,

00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:57.290 position:56%
champion the music of direct speech,
and the complex lyricism of meaning,

00:15:57.290 --> 00:16:00.920
and give shape to our imagination.

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:03.140
Rankine's book, "Citizen," winner

00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:07.090
of the National Book Critic
Circle Award, the Forward Prize,

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:12.070
and the Jackson Poetry Prize,
achieved a rare feat for poetry.

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:14.620 position:56%
It reached and moved a mass audience

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:17.180
in this country, and
around the world.

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:21.680
The Washington Post called
"Citizen," "Part protest lyric,

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:24.690
part art book, and a
dazzling expression

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:28.960
of the painful double consciousness
of black life in America."

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:33.350
Book Forum added that, "'Citizen'
is an anatomy of American racism

00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:37.750
in the new millennium, a
slender musical book that arrives

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:40.710
with the force of a thunderclap."

00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:44.370
And finally, Robert Newlen says,

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:49.120
"'Citizen' is an astounding
collision of verse and visuals."

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:53.800
The National Endowment of the
Arts recognized the enduring power

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:55.830
of "Citizen" when they added it

00:16:55.830 --> 00:17:00.760
to their nationwide Big
Read initiative last year.

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:06.970 position:56%
The year before, Yale University
award the Bollingen Prize in Poetry,

00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:10.000
the Library's first poetry
prize, as well as the model

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.320
for the Bobbitt Prize,
to Nathaniel Mackey.

00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:19.660
The Bollingen judges declared
Nathaniel Mackey's decades long

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:23.970
serial work, "'Songs
of Andoumboulou,

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:26.240
" and 'Mu' constitutes one

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:29.520
of the most poetic
achievements of our time.

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:36.100 position:56%
'Outer Pradesh,' jazz-inflected,
outward writing, passionately smart,

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:41.620
open and wise, beautifully
continues this ongoing project."

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:46.240
Mackey's many other honors include
the Poetry Foundation's honor

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:50.720
for Lifetime Achievement,
the Ruth Lilly Prize.

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:54.010
In his citation for the Prize,
"Poetry Magazine" editor,

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:58.380
Don Share noted that, "Mackey's
poetry ambitiously continues an

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:02.580
American bardic [phonetic] line
that unfolds from "Leaves of Grass,

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:07.540
to Pound's 'Cantos,' to HD's,
'Trilogy' winds through the whole

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:13.130
of Robert Duncan's work, and
extends beyond all of these."

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:16.690
Mackey's own rare combinations
create an astonishing

00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:18.560
and resounding effect.

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:24.770 position:56%
His words go where music goes, a
brilliant and major accomplishment."

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:27.500
We could not be more
grateful to celebrate two

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:30.740
of America's trailblazing
poets tonight.

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:35.510
Please join me in welcoming Claudia
Rankine, and Nathaniel Mackey.

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:53.380
&gt;&gt; Claudia Rankine: Good evening.

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:54.680
&gt;&gt; Good evening.

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:55.980
&gt;&gt; Claudia Rankine: Whenever
I come to Washington,

00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:57.320
I feel like I come to America.

00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:06.120
[Laughter] It's very, very,
very monumental to be here.

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:10.470
[Laughter] I would love to thank
the Bobbitt Family for this Prize,

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:13.930
and everyone at the
Library of Congress.

00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:20.940
And also it -- I cannot
communicate to you how honored I am

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:22.810
to share this evening
with Nate Mackey,

00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:26.530
whose work has been
behind my own work.

00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:29.560
So I'm much younger than he is.

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:37.790
I just want you to -- [laughter]
no, he has been so important to me

00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:43.430
over the years, so it's a
double honor; a double honor.

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:50.200
I was thinking about
what Mr. Bobbitt said

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:53.870
about the future being uncertain.

00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:57.130
And that is probably the most
optimistic thing I have heard

00:19:57.130 --> 00:19:58.930
in a long time.

00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:03.450
[ Background Sounds ]

00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:06.510
I'm going to read three
poems from "Citizen."

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:13.800
[ Background Sounds ]

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:18.950
The first poem is in memory
of James Craig Anderson.

00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:26.340
He was killed by Deryl
Dedmon in 2011.

00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:37.640
And I've been thinking a lot about
young white men who are caught

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:44.050
by white supremacy inside
a kind of disassociation

00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:47.780
from their own humanity, and
from humanity in general,

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:52.890
and from America as their
country, and this sense

00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:58.110
that they would rather
become murderers

00:20:58.110 --> 00:21:03.370
than share this country
with people of color.

00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:12.570 position:56%
It seems to me a kind of
wrong-headed equation around a sense

00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:19.220
of feeling lost and
disaffected inside our landscape.

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:30.250
I read -- I recently read the
journals of Dylann Roof, and he --

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:36.890
they're fascinating, if you have
a Sunday afternoon to read them.

00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:41.780
And he said that killing
those nine people

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:46.330
in Charleston was something
he had to do.

00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:50.720
And he knew that he
would have to go to jail.

00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:58.930
But he also felt that he would
be pardoned, which is the one --

00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:00.940
of everything I read
it's the one thing

00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:04.710
that I haven't been able to forget.

00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:17.100
Because it is a sense of a certain
world that has come into power;

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:19.940
and that sense that that
world will save him.

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:30.640
"'In the next frame, the

this predictable way.

Were you dreaming of this day
all the days of your youth?

In the daydream, did the
pickup take you home?

Was it a pickup fueling the road
to, 'I ran that nigger over?'

Baldwin says, 'Skin color
cannot be more important

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:40.290
than the human being.'

an exploding whiteness out of you?

You are so sorry.

anger, an effective one.

00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:16.670
the migration of a
traveling group known as "we."

00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:21.900
In a country called "Nub."

00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:27.090
It bears some resemblance
to this country, a world --

00:41:27.090 --> 00:41:33.540
a planet called "Nub" bears
some resemblance to this planet.

00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:38.610
And this one was recently published
in the nation back in the fall.

00:41:38.610 --> 00:41:43.150
Even though it was written a few
years ago, it was actually written

00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:45.960
around the time of
the midterm elections.

00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:52.710
"Nub's pendular politics
took our wind away.

00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:57.690
Suf [phonetic] was all
sigh, exasperation.

00:41:57.690 --> 00:42:02.900
We'd sat on a beach, biting hard
apples during an early go-around.

00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:06.230
Nothing we knew amounted to much.

00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:12.180
Only this or that oscillatory
witness, a topography of grief,

00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:15.880
regret rolled out under our feet.

00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:19.350
I thought of [inaudible],
low-hanging hips,

00:42:19.350 --> 00:42:24.070
and the honey-based perfume her
night garments had given off.

00:42:24.070 --> 00:42:29.110
[Inaudible] of win, the book Sophia
wrote us into again and again.

00:42:29.110 --> 00:42:35.300
The word we thought meant 'injury,'
meant 'winding,' we found out.

00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:42.110
I wanted whatever might last
to last, knowing nothing would.

00:42:42.110 --> 00:42:46.990
The words '[inaudible]' eternity
as close as we ever come.

00:42:46.990 --> 00:42:54.120
The words 'conjoined rehearsal,'
each the others second recess.

00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:58.450
I wanted not to be yelling
what was wrong, but I was.

00:42:58.450 --> 00:42:59.980
'Mama too tight' [phonetic]
might have been

00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:02.880
on the box, but I wasn't sure.

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:10.460
So it was, or so it seemed, or
seeming so, it made me reckon,

00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:13.920
warble to one side,
moved clamor to another,

00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:17.480
a worrying of all it was we knew.

00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:21.050
One would know the
quality of what I fled

00:43:21.050 --> 00:43:24.500
by my awakeness [phonetic],
my doctrine held.

00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:28.720
Doctrinal as I had let
myself be, not very.

00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:31.920
Awakeness turned all doctrine away.

00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:37.660
So with my rescinding
of souls, weak resolve,

00:43:37.660 --> 00:43:41.520
Nubs rescinded steps
inoculant [phonetic],

00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:46.920
a mirror might I have
gotten it to look.

00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:50.520
So it was I wasn't the only
one yelled, 'What was wrong?'

00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:55.030
Nubs forward steps in consequence.

00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:58.340
Nubs turned back on cue.

00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:02.140
Netsonet [phonetic] pliant hips,

00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:07.210
remote planted [phonetic] honey
wafted my head lifted there.

00:44:07.210 --> 00:44:11.480
I was older now, [inaudible]
the elders, avatar,

00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:15.330
be he mine as well as me his.

00:44:15.330 --> 00:44:19.210
Nub's raw cry rubbed us bloodless.

00:44:19.210 --> 00:44:24.460
Gauge and more gauge I
reached into a nested set;

00:44:24.460 --> 00:44:27.100
some recollection lay inside.

00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:32.410
I requested a song, my
reluctance to sing built out from,

00:44:32.410 --> 00:44:40.280 position:56%
song number 40 times four; song
number four to the second times ten;

00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:45.330 position:56%
four to the third times five divided
by two; song I'd be tied in knots

00:44:45.330 --> 00:44:52.570
and now singles number; song
Nub's temporizing led me to.

00:44:52.570 --> 00:44:55.730
Netsonet, fresh from
her bath, I remembered,

00:44:55.730 --> 00:45:01.090
balm against Nub's regression,
regressive itself no matter.

00:45:01.090 --> 00:45:04.810
Soft cloths of fumes
with [inaudible] honey,

00:45:04.810 --> 00:45:08.280
skin so diffused as well.

00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:13.380 position:56%
All of this light years away, so
remote it appeared, an unreal world,

00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:17.960
or another world, or another life,
mine would insisted itself to be.

00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:25.130
I was older now, [inaudible] the
elders, avatar, he's mine as well.

00:45:25.130 --> 00:45:30.540
Nub's pendular politics
endless waft with respite,

00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:33.940
honey heart's would be regime.

00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:39.070
So said song number four
times 80, divided by two,

00:45:39.070 --> 00:45:42.550
the song a reluctance
to sing set forth.

00:45:42.550 --> 00:45:48.120
Song so undone by Nub's pendular
politics, Nub's back and forth,

00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:51.610
so much more back than forth.

00:45:51.610 --> 00:45:56.210
Song I made myself breathe
in, not wanting to sing.

00:45:56.210 --> 00:46:01.210
Suf, one with suffusion,
Suf, nothing but soul, soul,

00:46:01.210 --> 00:46:04.840
nothing at all, if not respite.

00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:12.320
[Inaudible], we were times
catch, reminiscent kiss,

00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:18.410
reminiscent caress,
Netsonet's must recombinant,

00:46:18.410 --> 00:46:26.020
song number four times 40,
song 320 divided by two.

00:46:26.020 --> 00:46:30.980
All was number, abstract figure,
[inaudible] such as we with no skin

00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:37.090
to be had remitted more than we
have seen, or admitted we saw.

00:46:37.090 --> 00:46:40.740
Song number four times
four, times ten;

00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:46.100
song number ten times two times
eight; song sung high on the moon

00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:51.450
without wind, [inaudible],
some distention it seemed.

00:46:51.450 --> 00:46:55.690
Was it us getting old, or
the world, everyone wondered.

00:46:55.690 --> 00:46:59.000 position:56%
Abstract figure, and I see falsetto.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:03.300
Song number 80 times 2.

00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:06.020
A true institute of
sentiment it seemed,

00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:09.810
reminiscent regard,
reminiscent regret.

00:47:09.810 --> 00:47:16.540
To the feel, to the feeling, memory
escalated, release come to haunt,

00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:23.450
release come to heal,
release newly other to itself.

00:47:23.450 --> 00:47:30.370
Snub, nubs, buns, [inaudible];
pure permutation.

00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:35.680 position:56%
Abstract figure, abstract
filigree, abstract blaze [phonetic].

00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:42.640
Snub, nubs, buns, and [inaudible]
spat, last love songs, seven,

00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:47.440
abstract boast, abstract
bluster would be dispatched.

00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:52.200
We were spinning our
wheels, beginners again.

00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:55.790
Splinters pricked us on the
ass on the learners bench,

00:47:55.790 --> 00:48:00.370
each of us a fool come off
a hill, as off a throne.

00:48:00.370 --> 00:48:05.500
Snub, nubs, buns, a
lesson we learned by rote.

00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:10.590
Snub, nubs, buns, part
past, part secret pledge,

00:48:10.590 --> 00:48:14.770
said as if never to be heard again.

00:48:14.770 --> 00:48:18.010
Funny time no sooner
rose that faded.

00:48:18.010 --> 00:48:21.100
Lucky for us who were
otherwise unlucky.

00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:26.630
Nubs knew cathartics, a rumble in
our stomachs, outside in, you know.

00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:32.200
We were marking time,
led by Nub's temporizing.

00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:35.960
Legs netted, fish with
feet it seemed.

00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:41.300
We were marked by time, run
to and fro, Netsonet's crew.

00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:45.710
Reaches will be done,
our sweet-tooth wish.

00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:49.070
What thus we'd have come
to, we could only guess.

00:48:49.070 --> 00:48:52.820
Going on the need to
go on, Nub-like.

00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:54.950
I wanted the past back.

00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:57.990
Netsonet visited me in a dream.

00:48:57.990 --> 00:49:00.730
I told her I think about her often.

00:49:00.730 --> 00:49:05.250 position:56%
She said to me not to tell her that.

00:49:05.250 --> 00:49:08.730
Sweet figment of one
day when we were young,

00:49:08.730 --> 00:49:12.400
admit I was Anunsio
[phonetic] the elder again.

00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:15.390
Autumn's tally lassoed my legs,

00:49:15.390 --> 00:49:19.160
hooves at whose ends
would've been fish feet.

00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:23.820
Song number fourscore twice.

00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:27.990
What to go on, but the
need to go on kept at us.

00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:31.830
Buzz inside and out
we were put on by.

00:49:31.830 --> 00:49:35.750
It was a question we swung
at, wanted to knock down,

00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:39.780
a question we waved
away as we could.

00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:47.540
Crossroads called us out, loomed
at us, leg bug lassoed our legs.

00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:55.700 position:56%
Netted where we fish, roped where
we cattle, song 640 divided by four.

00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:59.490
Pure figure, pure form,
pure permutation.

00:49:59.490 --> 00:50:09.260
We knew Nub's minions gun
us down with impunity.

00:50:09.260 --> 00:50:13.240
Was it time or a particular
time we wanted out of?

00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:17.210
Time itself tainted,
never not particular.

00:50:17.210 --> 00:50:21.570
Time's particularity, the rope we
were caught by, net we were caught

00:50:21.570 --> 00:50:24.980
up in, we needed to know.

00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:31.040
Song number two times two, times
two times 20, roundabout numbering,

00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:34.350 position:56%
naming, named where none was before.

00:50:34.350 --> 00:50:39.740 position:56%
A late entry in the book of soul,
her dire sport [phonetic] soul mate,

00:50:39.740 --> 00:50:45.810
the wise one, or the wounded one,
her dire sport soul mate he'd be.

00:50:45.810 --> 00:50:49.770
The wise one or the wounded one
walked holding my hand beside

00:50:49.770 --> 00:50:51.230
the ledge.

00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:55.260
I bit my lip, feeling
trudge along so.

00:50:55.260 --> 00:51:00.610
I held back tears, the wise one,
who was also the wounded one.

00:51:00.610 --> 00:51:04.570
Wise to what end I wanted to know.

00:51:04.570 --> 00:51:07.980
Which of us was the pilgrim,
I also wanted to know.

00:51:07.980 --> 00:51:11.960
No way, something told
me, were we both.

00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:17.890
On into the enveloping fable,
deeper it insisted we go.

00:51:17.890 --> 00:51:21.860
The thing that was happening,
all of it, the bit of it,

00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:26.450
the something somehow telling
it the tale we'd come to know.

00:51:29.290 --> 00:51:33.170
Up late watching election
results back when,

00:51:33.170 --> 00:51:36.520 position:56%
lineaments like none, Sophia sensed.

00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:42.400
Calling it names, Nubs, stub,
flub, scrub, no release, no matter.

00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:45.060
Honey musk may be a
match, but no matter,

00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:46.830
hell bound Edmar [phonetic] said.

00:51:46.830 --> 00:51:48.590
I said, 'They're all ready.'

00:51:48.590 --> 00:51:51.250
'The poverty of politics would be

00:51:51.250 --> 00:51:54.160
with us always,' Aja
[phonetic] put in.

00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:56.770
Bounty be found all the same.

00:51:56.770 --> 00:52:01.660
Thought of Netsonet crowded
the room, the night balm

00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:04.010
where none otherwise was.

00:52:04.010 --> 00:52:09.240
Calm came over us, to divide
between legs what recompense we

00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:13.000
who were not always meat and bone.

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:16.850
So it seemed and seeming
so, so it was.

00:52:16.850 --> 00:52:19.880
Young wager come back to be real.

00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:22.650
All I took to be [inaudible].

00:52:22.650 --> 00:52:27.570
Nub never not with us,
never not prod, pebble,

00:52:27.570 --> 00:52:29.510
pearl there would eventually be."

00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:39.260
[ Background Sounds ]

00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:44.300
Where are we on time?

00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:51.690 position:56%
Okay; this is the poem that follows
that poem, and the book that follows

00:52:51.690 --> 00:52:54.160
that book, which is
called "Souls Notice."

00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:57.810
And it's a book -- it's
a poem in the Mu series.

00:52:57.810 --> 00:53:03.540 position:56%
I've developed this habit of writing
about bands, or creating bands

00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:07.780 position:56%
in my writing, in my prose,
famously so, but it's also something

00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:12.580
that started happening in my poems.

00:53:12.580 --> 00:53:16.880
"Air bands," I guess
you would call them.

00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:19.410
[Laughter] And one
of them that has come

00:53:19.410 --> 00:53:23.170
to be is the over ghost orchestra.

00:53:23.170 --> 00:53:26.720
And this poem is called "The
Over Ghost Orchestra's Next."

00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:31.960
And this poem actually
led to a talk, lecture,

00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:35.740
a paper that I wrote called
"Breath and Precarity."

00:53:35.740 --> 00:53:44.750
It was written after the killing
of Eric Garner and his last words,

00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:52.300
"I can't breath," which
has become a rallying cry.

00:53:52.300 --> 00:54:01.900 position:56%
And I was thinking about how much
breath gets expended in black music,

00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:07.480 position:56%
which is one of the things that has
buoyed us up over all these decades.

00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:11.460
And the phrase, "No
matter we couldn't breathe,

00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:16.980
we blew" started things to happen.

00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:22.290 position:56%
One of the great things about living
in North Carolina now is that I got

00:54:22.290 --> 00:54:28.500
to visit High Point, which is
where John Coltrane grew up.

00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:31.260
And I actually found the
address of his old --

00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:34.040
of the house he grew up in, and
I went by there and visited,

00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:37.710
and was happy to find out that
it was right around the corner

00:54:37.710 --> 00:54:40.790
from the Toussaint
Louverture Mason Lodge.

00:54:40.790 --> 00:54:44.950
[Laughter] That comes up in
the poem towards the end.

00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:50.330
"Nubs knew facelift got old.

00:54:50.330 --> 00:54:54.180
War droned on, money stayed on top.

00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:58.200
The abandoned boy and girl
went by every name known.

00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:02.190
Still, we bit the bullet and blew.

00:55:02.190 --> 00:55:06.330
'I will be and I'll believe
when I blow,' we announced.

00:55:06.330 --> 00:55:11.570
'I will be and abide by
sound, my slave day done.'

00:55:11.570 --> 00:55:15.920
We were back on Saint Sufferhead's
[phonetic] porch, a promontory.

00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:20.470
Some same tunes temporizing
remit, reminiscent romance,

00:55:20.470 --> 00:55:26.730
the feral's black torso reached for
and found [inaudible] arrows again.

00:55:26.730 --> 00:55:31.930
We were the feral's black
torso, lost and found again,

00:55:31.930 --> 00:55:34.880
thick reeds stuck to
a dry lower lip,

00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:41.900 position:56%
chapped kiss calling itself song, or
siblings, some same tunes high cry.

00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:45.870
We were the feral's black torso
cloat [phonetic], a call for cover,

00:55:45.870 --> 00:55:48.730
shot body, sirening alarm, we lost

00:55:48.730 --> 00:55:51.350
and found again, pantomimes
[inaudible].

00:55:51.350 --> 00:55:58.690
So it was, so we said, or
so we played canting say-so.

00:55:58.690 --> 00:56:01.110
Torn cloaks rule unrelenting.

00:56:01.110 --> 00:56:04.600
Torn cloak routing the day.

00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:07.620
Could we but be a band it
would all go away we thought,

00:56:07.620 --> 00:56:10.010
or we played like we thought.

00:56:10.010 --> 00:56:12.820
Could we but be a band
it would all be okay.

00:56:12.820 --> 00:56:18.830
So it was we were in a band,
so it was not so the same.

00:56:18.830 --> 00:56:24.270
What we cut we'd call a release;
release what we called out for.

00:56:24.270 --> 00:56:26.520
It had been going on
for only a minute.

00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:30.530
It had been going on
for as long as we knew.

00:56:30.530 --> 00:56:34.490
Nub said to be having
a conversation,

00:56:34.490 --> 00:56:38.070
no such one were we in.

00:56:39.270 --> 00:56:43.660
Unable to breathe,
though we were, we blew,

00:56:43.660 --> 00:56:47.170 position:56%
the crook of Nub's arm on our necks.

00:56:47.170 --> 00:56:51.450
We played with our hands
up, axis untouched, release,

00:56:51.450 --> 00:56:55.290
it was Teji's [phonetic]
bet would be sweet.

00:56:55.290 --> 00:57:02.170 position:56%
Nub held my neck in the crook of its
arm, the unworded song we sang said.

00:57:02.170 --> 00:57:04.860
Nub took me down, but
I was swinging.

00:57:04.860 --> 00:57:06.750
I got up swinging.

00:57:06.750 --> 00:57:10.910
Could we only band or bond,
we thought, but it wasn't so.

00:57:10.910 --> 00:57:16.760
Together as we were, we
suffered original suffer heads.

00:57:16.760 --> 00:57:21.570
Original suffer heads for all
eternity it seemed, wise ones,

00:57:21.570 --> 00:57:24.770
and wounded ones it seemed.

00:57:24.770 --> 00:57:29.150
The empathetic string
ensemble skipped out.

00:57:29.150 --> 00:57:33.020
A gig in the Czech
Republic, they said.

00:57:33.020 --> 00:57:37.240
So it was we were on our
own, erstwhile accompaniment,

00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:42.220
in the ground we got up from,
hot lights spiraling behind.

00:57:42.220 --> 00:57:45.310
Pulling thread from
string, string from rope,

00:57:45.310 --> 00:57:49.180
we'd have been had they been
there, a fraught way to feel,

00:57:49.180 --> 00:57:54.440
a fugue for the wretched
blows to the head as we blew.

00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:58.460
Hands up, windpipes
crushed, we blew.

00:57:58.460 --> 00:58:01.950
Over ghost [inaudible], behest.

00:58:05.070 --> 00:58:09.020
A high falsetto wind put
parts in our hair again.

00:58:09.020 --> 00:58:13.170
We heard bells, an avid
choir breaking glass they hit

00:58:13.170 --> 00:58:14.580
such high notes.

00:58:14.580 --> 00:58:18.150
Heads, all honey housed it seemed.

00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:24.260
Choked, held, haloed, we wanted
to say, but came up short.

00:58:24.260 --> 00:58:27.510
Hot light popping swept,
no matter the high wind,

00:58:27.510 --> 00:58:30.760
no matter where we were,
wherever it was we were.

00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:33.240
Hot light away we dwelt elsewhere.

00:58:33.240 --> 00:58:37.150
It was never just there we were.

00:58:37.150 --> 00:58:40.960
Wherever it was we were,
we were birds again,

00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:45.150
each with our own song,
each with a tutor song.

00:58:45.150 --> 00:58:48.420
'Teach me, tutor me,' we sang.

00:58:48.420 --> 00:58:53.210
Not withstanding we
couldn't breathe, we blew.

00:58:53.210 --> 00:58:58.380
A Masonic windpipe we resorted to
circular breathing with we blew.

00:58:58.380 --> 00:59:01.360 position:56%
'Luvature' we called it, church key,

00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:04.410
millet beer wept what
words there were.

00:59:04.410 --> 00:59:11.160
It was an underground pipeline
we got our breath back through.

00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:16.520
'Teach me, tutor me,' the words
that were thirst a way of knowing,

00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:19.750
not knowing, naustic
[phonetic], more stoic now.

00:59:19.750 --> 00:59:24.380
Our first day in the
land of the dead it was.

00:59:24.380 --> 00:59:27.640
Breathless though we were, we blew.

00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:32.290
Took a stand we were
taking down, we justified.

00:59:32.290 --> 00:59:38.130
Arrest what of Earth we
remembered, all else taken away.

00:59:38.130 --> 00:59:43.480 position:56%
So went the record what we read
into the record, new tears for Eric,

00:59:43.480 --> 00:59:46.080
new tunes for another Eric,

00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:50.110
commiserative our posture
must release.

00:59:50.110 --> 00:59:52.930
'Live in the land of the
dead,' we might have called it.

00:59:52.930 --> 00:59:56.470
Not withstanding we
couldn't breathe, we blew.

00:59:56.470 --> 01:00:00.270
No matter we couldn't breathe,
we blew, we kept insisting.

01:00:00.270 --> 01:00:05.000
Over ghost tremolo, over ghost
vibrato, over ghost cul de sac,

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:09.890
come to and come back from;
over ghost conversancy, no end.

01:00:09.890 --> 01:00:14.330
In the heart of [inaudible],
west of Egypt,

01:00:14.330 --> 01:00:18.080
no matter we couldn't
breathe, we blew.

01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:25.030 position:56%
No pitch, no tone, pulse only, a
tutor song, police batons taught us,

01:00:25.030 --> 01:00:32.530
hexameters tapped out
with a stick; liner note.

01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:37.820
The idea was we were
dead, already dead,

01:00:37.820 --> 01:00:42.170
always the same whipped,
already dead.

01:00:42.170 --> 01:00:46.180
The idea was we blew, not
yet knowing we were dead.

01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:49.920
To blow was to hope
against hope we had air,

01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:53.680
no matter we couldn't breathe,
breathe in, breathe out.

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:56.630
No matter we couldn't
breathe, keep breathing.

01:00:56.630 --> 01:01:01.610
The idea was we were
a claim the dead made.

01:01:01.610 --> 01:01:05.770
The idea we were a
strain put on the living.

01:01:05.770 --> 01:01:09.930
The idea was time turned
back, put its back to us.

01:01:09.930 --> 01:01:15.510
Back at some serial onslaught,
back at us, again and again.

01:01:15.510 --> 01:01:19.900
[ Paper Sounds ]

01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:24.200
We convened around the
corner from Coltrane's house,

01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:28.430
the Toussaint Louverture
Masonic Lodge.

01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:32.240
Acknowledgment hit,
we bowed our heads.

01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:36.170
It was nothing if not love's
arcade, and we wanted that,

01:01:36.170 --> 01:01:40.710
the idea we'd grounded
off with that.

01:01:40.710 --> 01:01:43.880
'Live in outer space'
we might have called it.

01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:47.670
'Why did they send us off the
planet so soon,' we wanted to know.

01:01:47.670 --> 01:01:51.740 position:56%
Demanded someone say, got no answer.

01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:17.930
Better born a dog [inaudible] we
squalled, calling up step even so.

01:02:17.930 --> 01:02:23.220
Giant steps, no, not
even steps, step.

01:02:23.220 --> 01:02:27.310
'Step' said everything,
all that we're about.

01:02:27.310 --> 01:02:39.510
