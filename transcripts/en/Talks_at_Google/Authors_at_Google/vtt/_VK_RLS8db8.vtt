00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:03.630
SPEAKER 1: Thank you, everybody,
for coming here today.

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.050
Before I invite
our guest on stage,

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:08.840
I want to start
off with a quote.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.870
"We will scour the Eastern
bloc to find someone

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.100
who can take down Dan Gable."

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.090
That's what the coach of the
1972 Soviet Olympic wrestling

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.250
team said about today's
Talks at Google guest.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.170
Dan is from Waterloo,
Iowa, and quickly

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.390
got into wrestling
growing up, always looking

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.700
to train, to exercise, taking
the layman's concept of what

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.080
we know as Rocky Balboa
to drastic new levels.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.110
Unlike most athletes,
Dan didn't wrestle

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:36.760
to overcome his opponent.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.380
He in many ways wrestled
to overcome himself.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.990
Never intimidated because it
was himself he was challenging,

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.070
every match, every
run, every chin-up,

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.312
trying to push himself beyond
what he knew was possible.

00:00:47.312 --> 00:00:49.770
Teammates would have to carry
Dan off of the wrestling mats

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.490
after practice.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:52.850
So, go figure.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.450
He won a lot, all of the
time, every single time

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.870
through high school and
then the NCAA championships,

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.490
setting new records and amazing
the world, which followed him.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.790
And then one match, his last
college wrestling match,

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:05.510
he lost.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.610
And he learned so
much from that defeat

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.470
that he went on to become
America's Olympic hero who

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.850
went through the
Olympics unscored on

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.990
and then continued
as Team USA wrestling

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.460
coach, coaching eight medalists,
four of which were gold.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.110
Dan also became the head coach
of the University of Iowa,

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.560
leading the Hawkeyes to 15
NCAA championships, crowning 45

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.510
champions and 152 All-Americans.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.430
At one point, almost every
single wrestler who won

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.940
the NCAA championships during
one year was one of Dan's.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.360
Needless to say, October 25
was Dan Gable Day in Iowa.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.820
So fellow Googlers,
please join me

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.250
in welcoming Dan Gable, who will
share the lessons he's learned.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.190
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.977
DAN GABLE: Wow.

00:01:58.977 --> 00:02:00.310
I thought you were really smart.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.384
SPEAKER 1: There's not a
teleprompter, I promise.

00:02:06.384 --> 00:02:08.050
DAN GABLE: I mean,
that was really good.

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.512
And I didn't realize
that was there.

00:02:10.512 --> 00:02:12.970
SPEAKER 1: Lamar, I said to
hide it when Dan came on board.

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.130
DAN GABLE: Oh my gosh.

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.180
That was pretty good.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.710
I'm usually not a guy
that likes to sit.

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:20.870
Too antsy.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.180
Because last time I didn't
really get ready for a match,

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.299
I lost it.

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:28.840
That was about the
only time, though.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.450
But there was reasons.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.930
And you have to kind of
diagnose that pretty well

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.150
to figure out the reasons.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:45.750
But obviously, it was something
that you never get over.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.520
But you've got to get on.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.270
And that's one of
these things for me

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.410
that it actually
made me realize--

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.880
most people thought I was
really good up to that point.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.900
When you win and go seven
straight years without a loss

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.820
and your record's 181 and
0, people think you're good.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:13.240
Obviously, my opponent
didn't think that,

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.660
or he took on the challenge.

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.890
But what happened was then
I was able to really go

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.090
to a new level.

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.560
And so you wonder how some of
these people at a certain level

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.480
of efficiency-- so you
can take your own life

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.440
and you can look at it
and say, well, you know,

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.180
I'm at this level, and I've
been working all my life

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.720
to get to this level.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.220
But how do I get to that level?

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.660
And maybe you can do it
quickly, or maybe it's

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:42.770
going to take time.

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.100
If I had won that
match, it would've

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:53.950
taken me a longer time
than by losing that match.

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.600
That was the first
time I was ever

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.620
able to experience
something of that magnitude

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:06.560
in a sport that actually made my
efficiency go up really quick.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.000
I believe-- I say this.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.190
For seven years, from a
sophomore in high school

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:18.100
to my last match in college,
I was on a trend like this.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.230
Seven years, it took from
this point to that point.

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:26.090
But within one year after that
loss, I took those seven years

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.150
and I put it all in one gain.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.120
So whatever it [INAUDIBLE]
the steep went like that.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.680
And in one year,
I gained as much

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.490
as I gained in seven years.

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:40.280
So I kind of figured that
out through the feelings

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.620
that I had, but I also
looked at things later

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.250
on that made me,
like, look at a guy

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.850
like Michael Jordan
for basketball.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.620
And you know, he was one
of the greats three years

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.010
into his NBA.

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:04.790
But he all of a sudden jumped
to another level of success.

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.280
And I don't know
exactly why he did that.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.570
It might be the
10,000 hour rule.

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.080
It might be a lot
of different things.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.390
You know, I look at
that 10,000 rule--

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:18.870
there was a book out on that--
and I did figure out my hours

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.010
for wrestling.

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:24.740
And I realized that
10,000 hours was already

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.990
accomplished before
I ever wrestled

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.050
a college wrestling match.

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:35.870
So to me, there was
a lot of time put in.

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.640
It just so happens
that my high school

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.830
coach, who is a famous
high school coach,

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.620
kind of realized that
this kid coming in

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.250
was maybe more of
a leader than most.

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.840
And because of that, he did
things that you can't do now.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.080
I don't know exactly what
you can and can't do,

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.000
but a couple things I
know you probably can't do

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.280
is you probably can't give
a first-year high school

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.010
student a key to the school.

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:04.980
And that's what he
did for me, because he

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:09.130
knew that I was going to be the
first guy there in the morning

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:10.180
opening the door.

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.230
And he knew that if he
didn't give me that key,

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:16.600
he had to be there at 6
o'clock to open it up.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.890
So it actually gave
him an opportunity

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:24.000
to have another leader in
the program besides himself.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.260
And he was at a point
and time in his life

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.570
where maybe he didn't have
the energy or whatever it was,

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:31.870
and he actually lived
quite a ways away.

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:36.200
So you know, it was
one of those things

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.990
that he gave me the
opportunity to help the team.

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:42.230
And really, I was a young kid.

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:44.020
And because I was a
young kid, I really

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:45.460
hadn't had that respect yet.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.910
So it was kind of--
he took a chance.

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:50.830
SPEAKER 1: So I
heard a few things

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:53.200
that I think the audience
would love to dig into.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.370
It sounded like you were given
a great opportunity early on,

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:57.710
the keys to a wrestling room.

00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:58.710
You had mentors.

00:06:58.710 --> 00:06:59.960
DAN GABLE: Keys to the school.

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.730
SPEAKER 1: Keys to the school.

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:02.690
You had mentors.

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:04.190
You had the right
people around you.

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:09.110
I also heard, whether
it's how many hours you're

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:11.570
working, that Michael Jordan
moment when you're learning,

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:12.620
just significantly increase--

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:13.328
DAN GABLE: Curve?

00:07:13.328 --> 00:07:16.580
SPEAKER 1: The curve, thank you.

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:20.570
I'm curious, like,
which one of-- trying

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:22.690
to extract lessons
here that we could all

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:27.970
take with us as the curve,
the right people around you.

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:30.030
What are some other
key lessons do you

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:33.610
think that in the next 40
minutes, we should talk about.

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:36.210
In addition to those, maybe
if we just have three or four,

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:38.840
and then we'll hone in on
those, break them down,

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.210
see how you learned it.

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:43.054
And hopefully, we can take
it with us when we're done.

00:07:43.054 --> 00:07:44.970
DAN GABLE: Yeah, I think
one of the key things

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:47.720
is really what you're born into.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:52.840
And you know, I
think that it's sad

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:56.320
that some people are born
into a situation that

00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:02.310
is almost impossible, at least
in they're younger years.

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:08.410
And so maybe that's a good
place to start, with mentors.

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:11.710
And so everybody here
can help the world.

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:16.480
Everybody, just because
you affect somebody.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:20.200
Whether it be your children,
whether it be your wife,

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.850
whether it be girlfriends,
whether it be your friends,

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:25.350
whether it be-- whoever it is.

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:27.490
Or in another way.

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:30.310
I mean, this company affects
a whole lot of people,

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:32.030
unbelievably.

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:35.650
And so for me, it wasn't the
perfect situation, my mom

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:36.530
and dad.

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:41.210
But they did look out for
their kids, which was me

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:43.700
and a sister that was
four years older than me.

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:47.420
So I was born into
a good situation.

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:49.440
It wasn't perfect,
and I doubt if there's

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.890
a perfect situation out there.

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:53.610
But it definitely
was a good one.

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:57.120
And so they probably
realized that they had more

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.010
than they can handle with
me, and so they gave me more

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:01.870
opportunities at a young age.

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:02.820
Like, OK.

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:05.650
This kid's got a lot of energy.

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:07.490
You We want to teach
him some things

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:10.360
away from the home
besides schooling,

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:13.180
because I really hadn't
started school yet.

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:17.420
So they had the
local YMCA, and they

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:19.540
had good people that
were working there,

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:24.780
and they stuck me in programs
that actually helped teach me

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:28.480
how to be a competitor, helped
teach me how to actually have

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:32.390
social skills, helped teach
me how to actually have

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:34.650
my first job.

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:39.380
You know, because I actually
got a job within the YMCA.

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:42.630
And I only stayed at the YMCA
from the years four to 12.

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:45.730
SPEAKER 1: How did you go about
that theme of acknowledging

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:47.730
your current situation,
what you would have

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:50.560
a competitive advantage on,
what could you make the most of,

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:53.050
and surround yourself
with the right people?

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:56.990
So it sounded like you took
advantage of everything

00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:58.290
that you had.

00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:00.600
What about when you were
a coach for the Hawkeyes

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:04.510
and your wrestlers were training
to become Olympic athletes,

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:05.380
NCAA champions?

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:07.880
How would you help them
surround themselves

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.880
with the right people?

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:15.210
DAN GABLE: Well, you know,
I'm a guy that communicates.

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:20.650
And I had to learn the hard way.

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:22.350
And so there's not
a lot that's going

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:26.590
to go on without me actually
communicating something,

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:29.920
whether it's been
said before or not.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.322
I don't trust one
of those things.

00:10:32.322 --> 00:10:33.780
And the reason why
I don't trust is

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:38.380
because we'll shoot ahead
a little bit when I was 15.

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:40.630
And so I'm walking to school.

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:43.860
And as I'm walking
to school, there's

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:45.710
this kid that was
in our neighborhood,

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:47.810
but I had never walked to
school with him before.

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:50.610
And I knew a little bit
about his reputation.

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:54.445
And his reputation wasn't
a real good reputation.

00:10:54.445 --> 00:10:57.160
He'd been in kind of
trouble quite a bit.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.920
But we're walking to school, and
he just happens to say to me,

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:01.720
he said, hey, Gable.

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.320
I think he was a year
or so older than me.

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.115
And he just said,
you know, you're

00:11:06.115 --> 00:11:09.570
doing pretty good in
this sport of wrestling.

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:10.070
That's good.

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:10.600
That's good.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:11.100
You know?

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:15.560
And he says, you know, you
got a really cute sister.

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:18.230
And then he told me about
three or four other sentences

00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:22.090
that were, like, not
so good, you know?

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:26.820
But being a young
guy, what do you say?

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:32.710
You know, it's just-- it was
something that stayed with me,

00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:39.740
but I actually never brought
it out until after the fact.

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:43.510
And so it was probably six
weeks later when after the fact

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:45.870
happened.

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:52.000
And it was in a car ride back
from a fishing cabin 100 miles

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.600
from home with my mom and dad,
because my sister wasn't-- she

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:59.380
didn't show up on
time that morning.

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:05.110
And because of that, all of
a sudden, I'm riding home.

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:06.775
By the way, he murdered her.

00:12:06.775 --> 00:12:11.080
He broke into the house
and raped and murdered her.

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:17.100
So on the way home, I'm thinking
about that conversation.

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:18.680
And I got a mom
and dad that are--

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:20.750
a mom that is hysterical
in the front seat.

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:24.390
My dad, he's-- and I said, all
of the sudden, I say to them,

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:28.360
I say, I think I might
know something about this.

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:31.380
And it's like, my dad--
how could you know

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:33.960
something about this up here?

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:37.370
And so he kind of
swerved the car over.

00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:39.510
Went out, opened
the back seat up,

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:41.135
kind of picked me
up, kind of shook me.

00:12:41.135 --> 00:12:42.926
What do you mean, you
might know something?

00:12:42.926 --> 00:12:44.400
I said, Dad, I
don't know for sure,

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:49.220
but this is a conversation I
had with this guy six weeks ago,

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:51.129
walking to school.

00:12:51.129 --> 00:12:52.920
You know, at first my
dad was-- he actually

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:54.710
cracked me across
the face and he said,

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:56.420
why didn't you say, something?

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:58.660
And I said, Dad, I just
thought it was boy talk.

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:03.190
But it was actually a lead.

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:04.910
And they brought him
in for questioning,

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:08.430
and he actually admitted
everything right there.

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:11.930
And he was a young guy.

00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:16.870
But you know, for me,
it was like my family,

00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:20.350
what it did for
my family, it just

00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:23.900
was going to tear this family
apart, the family of three

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:25.460
that's left.

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:31.710
And so for me, it was like, I
didn't really feel the guilt,

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:35.220
but I felt more
like the motivation.

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:41.950
Like, I knew that Mom and Dad,
I needed to keep them together

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:44.830
because they were just fighting
and fighting and fighting,

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:46.210
and they continued to do that.

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:49.970
And I moved out of my bedroom,
and one night I got up

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:52.736
and I just looked at them
in the middle of the night

00:13:52.736 --> 00:13:54.620
when they were, like,
fighting and yelling.

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:59.580
And I think it took a
really strong statement

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:01.580
to get me out of bed.

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:04.890
And I think the statement
was really simple for my mom.

00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:09.060
She just said to my
dad that I wished

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:11.170
I would have raised
her to be-- I

00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:12.849
think she said the word whore.

00:14:12.849 --> 00:14:14.890
You know, and then she
would have gave in to him.

00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:19.580
And you know, she fought
for her life to not give in,

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:22.640
which I commend her for that.

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:24.910
But that got me out
of the bed, and that

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:27.240
made me realize that something
had to be taking place.

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:31.780
So a 15-year-old kid decides
to move into her room,

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:33.400
because that room
is kind of haunted

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:34.710
ever since we moved into it.

00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:38.617
So when I moved into that
room, that night, I actually

00:14:38.617 --> 00:14:40.950
went in there and told them,
and a little bit later they

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:43.000
just kind of snuck in
there and looked at me.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.460
And they looked at me
like I was sleeping,

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:46.130
but I wasn't sleeping,
I can tell you.

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:50.132
But it kind of started
things changing.

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:56.030
And the fact that
I would wrestle

00:14:56.030 --> 00:15:01.790
for her and for them and
for everybody else that

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:02.960
was pushing for me.

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:07.420
But you know, it gave
me a lot of motivation

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:11.480
on such a negative aspect.

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:14.460
But that's just one thing.

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:17.740
Because adversity, you know,
I'm going to talk-- adversity,

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:18.820
it happens to all of us.

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:22.270
I mean, it could happen
today, something.

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:28.470
And I used to talk about
adversity in two aspects.

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:32.440
Adversity, you take it
on, or you take it on.

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:36.790
And I think we can probably
find something in our life

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:39.240
that we either are
doing something,

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:43.090
or we're not about something
that we should be doing.

00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:48.280
And I really only had that line
for a short period of time.

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:53.570
The short period of time
eliminates the second part.

00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:55.140
Adversity, you take it on.

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:57.870
There's no or in adversity.

00:15:57.870 --> 00:15:59.950
And it's easier said than done.

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:02.400
Especially in Ls and
Ds, life and death.

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:05.070
Wins and losses,
that's another story.

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:08.010
Yeah, you've got to
take that on too.

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:12.020
But there's two
levels of grief there.

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:15.010
And obviously, life
and death is the one

00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:17.370
that's a little bit more
difficult, a lot more

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:20.990
difficult. But the
winning and the losing

00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:25.720
also can be a pretty--
can hit you pretty hard.

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:28.180
So I go seven years,
I have a loss.

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:30.170
And that's going to hit you.

00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:32.460
And that's why I was able
to go to that next level.

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:36.750
I've been hit hard at
special times in my life.

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:39.290
Record performance times.

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:40.500
I mean, seven years.

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:41.909
Finally have one
more match, only

00:16:41.909 --> 00:16:43.950
person ever going to be
undefeated in high school

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:50.520
and college, and
I get distracted.

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:52.960
I don't wrestle
up to my ability.

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:54.675
And had I wrestled
up to my ability

00:16:54.675 --> 00:16:56.550
and done everything
right, I can handle that.

00:16:56.550 --> 00:17:02.414
But when you don't do it
right and you get involved,

00:17:02.414 --> 00:17:05.410
you know that you're better,
that's harder to take.

00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:07.800
So then as a coach,
wouldn't you know it again?

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:12.020
Go almost 10 years without a
loss at the NCAA championship

00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:13.680
from a team point of view.

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:18.569
And then record
performance, we lose.

00:17:18.569 --> 00:17:21.920
But you've got to
analyze those losses.

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:25.060
You've got to analyze
the death, you know?

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:28.470
And obviously, the
communication aspect for me

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:30.520
has never been a
problem anymore.

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:33.100
When I hear something,
unless it's just

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:34.670
dead silence, you
know, that you've

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:38.750
got to keep this secret because
of no major reason or a really

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:41.850
good reason, you know,
you've got to communicate.

00:17:41.850 --> 00:17:46.810
But you know, the wins and
losses after seven years

00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:49.060
and after 10 years,
they hit you hard.

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:53.390
And you really go back and you
figure out what took place.

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:55.850
Go back 365 days a year.

00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:59.020
And I actually analyzed
every day up to that loss.

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:02.770
And even though the bottom line
was the kid got inside my head.

00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:05.490
He used tactics.

00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:08.894
I never even really paid much
attention to him on that loss

00:18:08.894 --> 00:18:11.060
until he came to the
tournament, and all of a sudden

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:15.400
at a press conference like
this, he shot his mouth off.

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:20.210
Which I absorbed it.

00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:23.570
And my focus went
from me to him.

00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:27.210
And because it went
to him, I wasn't

00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:28.760
worrying about my skills.

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:30.520
I was worrying about his skills.

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:34.950
And when you go into a
competition, wins and losses,

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:36.840
business and not
business, you've

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:39.244
got to focus on
what you're good at.

00:18:39.244 --> 00:18:40.910
And when you focus
on what he's good at,

00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:42.689
that means he's going
do something to you,

00:18:42.689 --> 00:18:44.980
and you're not going to be
at the best of your ability.

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:47.280
So that was pretty amazing.

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:52.300
But my team loss, my team
loss, this was my team,

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:57.980
it was because we were
celebrating too much

00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:00.080
and because we
just thought it was

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:02.500
going to be automatic because
you did this, you did this.

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:06.030
Nothing's automatic, and
there's always things

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:07.730
that you can change.

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:12.640
And when you see something
that needs changed,

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:15.660
and if you let it go in
your life or your business

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:19.290
or your family, every
day you let it go,

00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:23.690
there's a term called
the longer, the longer.

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:28.490
And that term means that the
longer you let it go upfront,

00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:32.340
the longer it's going to take
on the back to really get back.

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:34.420
Even thought as
soon as we lost, I

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:36.850
thought we'd get
right back on top.

00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:38.950
Well, it took us
five years to go

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:42.790
from-- we went two,
two, and three,

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:45.520
and went all way
down to, like, six.

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:47.360
And then we started
back up again.

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:50.780
But it took all that time, just
because it took all that time

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:52.040
to tear us down.

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:56.149
Now you'd have to analyze
how long you've been-- like,

00:19:56.149 --> 00:19:58.440
say you're in a marriage,
and you've got to look at it,

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:00.244
and it's not going so good.

00:20:00.244 --> 00:20:01.660
You've got to kind
of look and see

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:04.557
how long you've been
not being so good,

00:20:04.557 --> 00:20:06.640
and don't think it's going
to change right around.

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:10.140
You almost have to build it up
as long as you tore it down.

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:12.470
But you're always hoping
for the quickness,

00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:16.490
but the quickness
won't be stable.

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:17.909
And you need that consistency.

00:20:17.909 --> 00:20:20.200
When that consistency is
there-- I mean, I'll tell you,

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:22.970
it's 42 years now with my wife.

00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:24.225
42 years of marriage.

00:20:24.225 --> 00:20:25.185
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:25.185 --> 00:20:25.970
Same wife.

00:20:29.602 --> 00:20:30.700
I don't need that.

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:32.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:34.870
Because it might
be-- I don't know.

00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:38.610
But if I don't keep working
at it, it's not going be 43,

00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:41.302
I can tell you that.

00:20:41.302 --> 00:20:43.830
It's not going to be there
just because it's there.

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:48.420
So you know, when
it was shaky, it

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:56.064
was because we weren't doing
the right things, mostly.

00:20:56.064 --> 00:20:57.480
We weren't doing
the right things.

00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:00.084
One of the craziest things
that-- one of the best things

00:21:00.084 --> 00:21:01.500
I ever did in my
life-- and I know

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:05.360
it's not good for a lot
of you guys or girls--

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:19.822
is that 1987, which was 13,
16, 29 years-- I don't know.

00:21:19.822 --> 00:21:21.030
Can you add?

00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:23.230
SPEAKER 1: The
engineers, come on.

00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:25.710
DAN GABLE: Anyway--

00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:27.700
[LAUGH]

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:33.095
You know, I came home late.

00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:37.940
I had to get up early.

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:42.880
So then I came home,
and I said, never again

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:44.600
am I going to go to excess.

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:51.370
So it's been since
1987 that in one day,

00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:55.506
I've never had more than
two beers in my life.

00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:03.620
If I hadn't made that
vow and kept that vow,

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:05.060
I wouldn't have said 42 years.

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:07.940
There is no way,
because that would

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:09.810
have been gone a long time ago.

00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:11.840
That would have been gone.

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:15.480
It's just something that
for me-- and again, I've

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:17.680
got to work on that too,
because these guys are

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:20.310
trying to get me out
drinking tonight over here,

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:21.670
and I don't know.

00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:23.420
SPEAKER 1: It's the
wrestlers in business?

00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:27.100
DAN GABLE: Actually, I
get 32 ounces of beer.

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:29.322
You know, because if you
say two beers, I mean,

00:22:29.322 --> 00:22:30.780
some guy gives you
a quart of beer,

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:32.540
then he gives you
a gallon of beer.

00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:34.750
You know, so you've
got to actually define

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:36.640
it a little bit.

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:39.320
And I've stayed
that [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:41.170
And then you can't
also use two days.

00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:42.620
You can't go in a row, like, OK.

00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:44.970
It's 11:58, you drink two beers.

00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:47.990
And then it's 12:02 next day,
you can drink two more beers.

00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:49.490
And then you've got
a bigger bottle.

00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:51.190
I've got to be smart.

00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:55.040
You've got to be
right exact and know.

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:56.820
And you know, now
that I'm actually

00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:59.230
getting a little bit
older, even though I

00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:04.760
don't claim I'm over 29
on the workout machines,

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:09.200
because they always say age,
weight, all that kind of stuff.

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:13.420
I always say 29, and I
always win the damn thing

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:14.580
over the 29-year-olds.

00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:17.220
I'm always ending up the
first guy whatever I went.

00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:18.459
15 minutes at this level.

00:23:18.459 --> 00:23:20.000
And then they say,
it's how you rate.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.286
And every time I jump
off, if it's number one,

00:23:23.286 --> 00:23:24.160
you know, I jump off.

00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:27.600
It's number two, I've got
to go back and do it again.

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:30.862
But you know, that's
just the way I think.

00:23:30.862 --> 00:23:31.820
That's the way I think.

00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:39.640
But obviously, adversity has
been something that I hate.

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:41.370
I don't like it at all.

00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:44.350
A lot of people thrive on it.

00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:49.600
I like prevention of adversity.

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:52.579
The more adversity I
have, the more I get down.

00:23:52.579 --> 00:23:54.370
But some people can
thrive on a little bit.

00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:56.712
I've got a couple buddies
that actually, that's

00:23:56.712 --> 00:23:58.420
the only way they can
get good is if they

00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:00.020
have something go bad on them.

00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:04.405
But I like good, good,
good, good, good, you know?

00:24:04.405 --> 00:24:07.390
Even though it
hasn't been perfect.

00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:10.020
And I don't think there
will be a perfect situation,

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:11.430
on this earth anyway.

00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:15.657
So it doesn't mean you
can't strive for it.

00:24:15.657 --> 00:24:17.740
That doesn't mean I shouldn't
have won that match.

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:20.790
But if I would have
won that match,

00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:22.510
the way I wrestled
in that match,

00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:24.360
I probably wouldn't
have won the Olympics

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:25.360
like I won the Olympics.

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:27.360
You know, maybe I would
have won the Olympics.

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:29.460
But you know, I won them
and nobody scored on me.

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:32.360
I mean, I think the
last 21 matches I had,

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:38.440
Olympic competition and
Olympic games, was 130 to one

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:43.480
and 12 pins out of 21 matches,
with nobody scoring on me.

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:47.250
You know, that's like
domination, kind of.

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:49.750
Except for that one
point, you know?

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:51.470
Would you give us
any suggestions

00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:54.960
on how to find the lessons
from adversity without having

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:57.570
those catastrophic losses?

00:24:57.570 --> 00:25:00.390
Being able to think that
way, although you're not

00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:01.900
in such a situation?

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:04.390
Proactively hit that curve
you were talking about?

00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:09.860
I don't think it's possible.

00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:10.360
No.

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:12.620
I just don't think you
can be smooth sailing.

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:16.680
Because longer the
longer thing again.

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:18.820
When I look at that
coaching thing,

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:29.160
I was breaking down for
at least five years.

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:38.260
And by that, I mean we lost it
in '87, so in the start of '83,

00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:41.950
I was not doing all the
best decisions I can make.

00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:45.520
And the funny thing
was, in '83, we won.

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:47.270
In '84, we won.

00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:48.840
'85, we won.

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:50.210
'86, we won.

00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:53.600
So Google, I don't even
know what Google is.

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:57.090
But I asked you about it.

00:25:57.090 --> 00:25:58.290
I mean, I knew what it was.

00:25:58.290 --> 00:25:59.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:03.390
And I love your answer
about making things easier

00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:05.140
for everybody.

00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:08.730
Because that's kind of
why I was a good coach.

00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:13.710
If you're just a good wrestler,
you know, there's ways to win.

00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:18.020
But as you go higher of a level,
once you go from high school

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:21.020
to college, then on
to your Olympic level,

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:24.570
you're not going to win the
Olympics unless you have

00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:27.780
both hard work and smart work.

00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:29.940
And so that
efficiency of Google,

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:33.350
of trying to make things easier,
to get you access and so on,

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:35.050
that's like a wrestling match.

00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:39.930
I mean, I personally kept
getting better all the time.

00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:42.510
And all of the sudden, instead
of struggling to score,

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:45.236
I could score quicker,
easier, because the skills

00:26:45.236 --> 00:26:46.860
and the techniques
were getting better.

00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:50.230
I mean, for me, I got this
guy over here, Nick Gallo

00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:54.140
over here, that I used to
train with him all the time.

00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:57.420
He didn't like this
hard, tough nosed style

00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:59.770
of wrestling that I had.

00:26:59.770 --> 00:27:02.740
He liked slick, quick.

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:04.550
He didn't want to get tired.

00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:07.599
You know, for me, I had to
take and learn some of that.

00:27:07.599 --> 00:27:09.390
I don't mind getting
tired, because I never

00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:11.100
knew I got tired.

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:13.890
And so instead of
being really efficient,

00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:15.700
I just struggled--
not struggled,

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:19.300
but I would get to it
and finish and win,

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:20.780
but that's at that lower level.

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:23.230
As I got higher, I
had to actually know

00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:25.560
how to be more efficient.

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:30.424
And I've seen five people
try to jump Nick Gallo,

00:27:30.424 --> 00:27:32.090
and none of them could
get a hold of him

00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:34.255
because it was like a noodle.

00:27:34.255 --> 00:27:35.867
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:35.867 --> 00:27:36.700
He'd grab and he'd--

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:37.720
[SWOOSHING]

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:47.510
So things like that kind
of-- you've got to be-- OK,

00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:52.340
so I'm going to the woods,
and I love hard work.

00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:59.230
And I take my-- nowadays,
I take my chainsaw.

00:27:59.230 --> 00:28:01.150
The old days, you'd take an ax.

00:28:01.150 --> 00:28:02.410
But I'll tell you what.

00:28:02.410 --> 00:28:04.810
I run out of gas, my
engine breaks down,

00:28:04.810 --> 00:28:09.060
and I can't cut the trees down,
I still have my ax with me.

00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:12.060
So I've got my efficiency.

00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:12.900
I'm going to do it.

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:14.483
But if I have to do
hard work and I've

00:28:14.483 --> 00:28:16.080
got to get a certain
thing done, I'm

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:18.230
going to have a backup plan.

00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:21.280
And a lot of people
don't have backup plans.

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:24.897
And in your life, a lot of
times, especially with Google,

00:28:24.897 --> 00:28:26.480
I mean, you're just
constantly wanting

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:28.349
to do things efficiently
and everything.

00:28:28.349 --> 00:28:30.640
You know, sometimes you've
got to do a little hard work

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:32.210
to become efficient.

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:34.800
And you've got to stay
in that hard work.

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:38.080
And sometimes you've
got to work through that

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:43.640
to get to that great
ability to dominate.

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:46.060
So that's kind of my
relation with Google.

00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:49.310
Wrestling, there's
so many disciplines

00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:51.000
that you have to master.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.270
Otherwise, they show
right in front of you.

00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:55.600
Everybody sees them.

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:57.550
If you get tired in
a wrestling match,

00:28:57.550 --> 00:28:59.400
there's two people out there.

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:01.750
And if you see that
everybody's going

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:03.730
to-- all your coach,
your teammates,

00:29:03.730 --> 00:29:06.740
all the fans are
going to see who's

00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:08.700
going to be tired, who's
not going to be tired.

00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:11.920
Because they're going to watch
shoestring tricks, and that's

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:13.160
why they've eliminated those.

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:15.118
They don't even put
shoestrings a lot of times,

00:29:15.118 --> 00:29:16.975
or they make you tape them.

00:29:16.975 --> 00:29:18.350
Or if you're going
out of bounds,

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:20.599
and you want to go back in,
and they take the big walk

00:29:20.599 --> 00:29:23.577
around the circle to come
back in to get their breath.

00:29:23.577 --> 00:29:24.660
You know, stuff like that.

00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:29.420
Or just in life, say you
have to make a weight class.

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:31.206
Or you want to be
healthy in life.

00:29:31.206 --> 00:29:32.330
Because I'll tell you what.

00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:36.965
As you get older, it's really
critical to stay healthy.

00:29:36.965 --> 00:29:40.829
If you think you're going
to make it your whole life

00:29:40.829 --> 00:29:42.620
by not staying healthy,
you can do all this

00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:45.130
and do all that, I'm telling
you, you're kidding yourself.

00:29:45.130 --> 00:29:46.130
You're kidding yourself.

00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:48.320
So you know, for
wrestling a lot of times,

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:53.140
we have to master
nutrition and conditioning.

00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:56.400
And they go hand in hand, and
you have to read about it,

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:58.970
and you have to learn about
it, and you have to understand.

00:29:58.970 --> 00:30:00.570
I'm surprised that
some of the kids

00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:02.946
that I got to me
from high schools,

00:30:02.946 --> 00:30:04.320
even though they're
top recruits,

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:08.660
had no idea about the
scientific rules of, you know,

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:12.510
like, nutrition or
losing weight properly.

00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:15.400
You know, again, there's a lot
of-- I call them disciplines.

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:17.520
But of course, you also
have to know techniques.

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:19.560
You have to be updated on them.

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:22.430
You have to know your tactics.

00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:24.770
You have to know your
opponent a little bit.

00:30:24.770 --> 00:30:29.590
And so you know, it's just
what builds your mind, what

00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:32.080
builds your mind.

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:34.956
Because that's going
to decide, your mind,

00:30:34.956 --> 00:30:37.550
is whether you're
going to win and lose

00:30:37.550 --> 00:30:40.480
or how much life
you've got, or you're

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:42.840
going to be dead quicker.

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:44.880
A lot of it, whether
it's-- I mean,

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:47.510
there's freak things
that happen out there.

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:50.850
But you know, it's amazing.

00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:53.760
One of my good
friends just never

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:58.670
stopped partying after college.

00:30:58.670 --> 00:31:00.010
He partied all through college.

00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:01.140
Did really well.

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:05.400
He was, you know,
a genetic-type guy.

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:07.946
But he just kept on doing
that his whole life.

00:31:07.946 --> 00:31:09.320
But about 10 years
ago, you know,

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:11.750
when he's carrying
his oxygen tank around

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:13.460
with him because he
smoked all the time

00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:18.339
and he drank all the time-- and
he gave up smoking maybe seven

00:31:18.339 --> 00:31:19.380
years ago, I think I was.

00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:20.430
Eight years ago.

00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:28.120
And so he had 20% of one
lung seven years ago.

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:31.110
He's still got 20% of one lung.

00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:32.730
It's pretty amazing.

00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:34.670
I mean, today's a
little different.

00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:38.120
My mom and dad smoke,
drink pretty good,

00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:41.250
but the smoking part--
but there wasn't really

00:31:41.250 --> 00:31:44.520
any information out there.

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:52.040
And you know, they
lived till 67 and 73.

00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:54.180
But, you know, I got a
ways to go to get there.

00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:55.310
I'm 29.

00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:56.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:04.210
But it's one of these things
that, I never smoked, really.

00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:04.960
Maybe as a kid.

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:06.377
I shouldn't say that.

00:32:06.377 --> 00:32:07.210
But I never inhaled.

00:32:07.210 --> 00:32:09.830
I just thought it was cool
to smoke Swisher Sweets.

00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:15.230
Swisher Sweets when I was in
sixth grade and seventh grade.

00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:17.315
Sixth grade, I think.

00:32:17.315 --> 00:32:19.060
Fishing.

00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:22.895
But that was just
a temporary thing.

00:32:22.895 --> 00:32:25.070
But it's just one
of those things.

00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:28.160
And like I said, two-beer
limit probably helped me a lot.

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:30.520
And that's just one
of those things.

00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:33.241
But I do have my drawbacks.

00:32:33.241 --> 00:32:34.240
I just want you to know.

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:36.134
There's no perfect
situation out there.

00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:40.029
Mountain Dew.

00:32:40.029 --> 00:32:40.570
Mountain Dew.

00:32:40.570 --> 00:32:41.861
SPEAKER 1: That's the drawback?

00:32:41.861 --> 00:32:44.790
DAN GABLE: Yeah, I just--
somebody's got to kick my butt,

00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:46.040
get me off that.

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:47.612
But nobody can
kick my butt, so--

00:32:47.612 --> 00:32:48.272
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:48.272 --> 00:32:50.230
SPEAKER 1: Nick, do you
want to challenge that?

00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:52.594
NICK GALLO: I know
all his weaknesses.

00:32:52.594 --> 00:32:53.260
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:54.830
DAN GABLE: None.

00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:56.160
On the mat.

00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:58.280
SPEAKER 1: So thank
you so much for sharing

00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:01.880
your life story, your
perspective on just

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:03.020
accomplishing anything.

00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:05.660
So I feel like we have
so many pieces of wisdom

00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:08.526
from everything
you just explained.

00:33:08.526 --> 00:33:12.740
I'd like to invite all of you
to join us, ask a few questions.

00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:17.510
Before I do that, though, Dan
did author his autobiography.

00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:19.660
Do you want to tell
us about this book?

00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:21.420
Which all of you
can buy back there,

00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:28.448
and then we'll move to
Q&amp;A. Should we buy it?

00:33:28.448 --> 00:33:30.156
DAN GABLE: Unless you
want to get pinned.

00:33:30.156 --> 00:33:32.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:32.850 --> 00:33:33.900
No.

00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:38.356
Yeah a lot of people
have bought it.

00:33:38.356 --> 00:33:44.230
But it's one of those things
that if you like books

00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:47.810
that you can read a chapter
and set it down, and come back

00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:49.010
to it, that's fine.

00:33:49.010 --> 00:33:49.860
This is the book.

00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:53.210
I mean, it's like every
chapter's a new chapter.

00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:55.972
And there's a lesson
in every chapter.

00:33:55.972 --> 00:33:58.180
In fact, I got a new book
coming out in about a year.

00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:00.780
But I took a lesson
out of each chapter,

00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:04.560
and have a chapter on those
lessons in the next one.

00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:08.260
And this book actually
says a lot of good things

00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:10.600
about not just
wrestling by any means.

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:16.709
About family, about my
best friends growing up.

00:34:16.709 --> 00:34:18.500
And there's a lesson
with each one of them.

00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:22.679
Because I didn't get
to be who I am by just

00:34:22.679 --> 00:34:26.170
me and my mentors
of my mom and dad.

00:34:26.170 --> 00:34:29.440
It took a lot of help from a
lot of people along the way,

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:31.820
whether it be at the Y or
whether it be my coaches

00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:33.340
or teachers, or my friends.

00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:34.090
My friends.

00:34:34.090 --> 00:34:38.060
I mean, my friends were,
like, they looked out for me,

00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:42.300
because there was this crazy
kid that was a fanatic somewhat.

00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:47.409
And so my friends taught
me about having a beer,

00:34:47.409 --> 00:34:50.310
and they taught me about girls.

00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:53.300
SPEAKER 1: My favorite lesson
that I got from this book

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:55.100
was when you were
coaching Barry,

00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:57.930
and how you empowered him to
be an NCAA national champion.

00:34:57.930 --> 00:35:01.040
You didn't scare him to it.

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:03.770
Barry was not always--
he was sometimes into it,

00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:04.600
sometimes not.

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:06.200
He wasn't sure if
he really wanted

00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:08.491
to move through and put all
the dedication into winning

00:35:08.491 --> 00:35:09.890
the national championships.

00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:12.140
And Dan was just--
by supporting him,

00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:15.480
empowering him to accomplish
what no one else was

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:16.910
able to in his weight class.

00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:18.993
DAN GABLE: Well, Barry
Davis you're talking about,

00:35:18.993 --> 00:35:20.630
who was a three-time
NCAA champion.

00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:23.151
Well, he ran off on me,
and I had to find him.

00:35:23.151 --> 00:35:24.650
Most people, when
somebody runs off,

00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:26.450
they don't even bother
to go find them.

00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:29.380
Well, I'm pretty much of
a Sherlock Holmes expert,

00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:32.140
and so I had a lot of that
training when I was growing up.

00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:35.330
And so I always got a
lot of people to help me.

00:35:35.330 --> 00:35:37.490
It wasn't just me
looking for somebody.

00:35:37.490 --> 00:35:39.240
But Barry, I had to find him.

00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:40.750
And I got a little lucky there.

00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:43.550
And I think the more prepared
you are, the luckier you get.

00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:47.890
So I did luckily find him
at a point in his career

00:35:47.890 --> 00:35:50.400
which would have made a
big difference in his life.

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:54.540
And you know, I also,
when I did find him,

00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:56.950
pure emotion happened
between me and him.

00:35:56.950 --> 00:36:00.020
He was going to run
off, and I actually

00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:02.490
broke down crying a little bit.

00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:05.160
But I never pressured
him to come back.

00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:06.090
But he wanted to.

00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:08.150
I mean, he was just
waiting for me to find him,

00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:09.466
but he was hiding.

00:36:09.466 --> 00:36:10.840
And I got lucky,
and I found him.

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:14.100
So it's like, wow.

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:15.550
Some things are like karma.

00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:18.590
They're just like,
how'd that happen?

00:36:18.590 --> 00:36:22.150
But Barry is-- you know, he's
still working on it today.

00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:25.710
I mean, even though he's a coach
somewhere and a mentor of kids.

00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:27.360
And that's how I measure people.

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:31.260
So I measure people
by not really

00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:33.950
how they did with me
back 20 years ago,

00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:35.540
30 years ago, whenever it is.

00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:39.430
I kind of measure people, like,
where are they at right now?

00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:41.640
And you know, that's,
to me, more important.

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:44.100
And the ones that have
really gone on and do well,

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:46.310
then I'm really proud of them.

00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:48.030
And if they take
care of their family

00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:51.490
and if they've stayed
within our profession.

00:36:51.490 --> 00:36:55.785
Like, you just don't
let it go totally.

00:36:55.785 --> 00:36:56.410
You live on it.

00:36:56.410 --> 00:36:57.780
Because you know what?

00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:02.740
It's more about people having
these things to look up to.

00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:07.380
And it's like, it can be
gone tomorrow, you know?

00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:10.450
But it's like, will
you really be gone,

00:37:10.450 --> 00:37:12.102
or are you going to live on?

00:37:12.102 --> 00:37:14.372
And are people going to care?

00:37:14.372 --> 00:37:15.580
You know, that type of thing.

00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:21.110
And so for me, it's like, I
want to forever live, you know?

00:37:21.110 --> 00:37:25.290
Even though I'm
not on this earth.

00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:28.370
And if I can do that, that means
I've touched a lot of people,

00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:30.370
and I've given a lot
of people a chance

00:37:30.370 --> 00:37:36.840
to be a little bit better
with their own lives.

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:40.230
And so like I said,
family of four.

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:42.380
I'm the only one that's alive.

00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:44.760
Now it's a family at 21.

00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:47.500
And we talk about that
a lot in this book.

00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:50.140
And that 21 motivates me.

00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:54.640
It's why I'm here, for my
sport and for my family.

00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:56.950
For my sport and my family.

00:37:56.950 --> 00:38:00.910
And it's going to be
good for both of them,

00:38:00.910 --> 00:38:03.134
me being on a
Google Talk, right?

00:38:03.134 --> 00:38:04.300
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, absolutely.

00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:06.180
DAN GABLE: I mean, is this going
to actually go out to people?

00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:07.055
SPEAKER 1: Your call.

00:38:07.055 --> 00:38:07.732
DAN GABLE: Huh?

00:38:07.732 --> 00:38:09.065
SPEAKER 1: You can decide later.

00:38:09.065 --> 00:38:09.770
DAN GABLE: Oh, wow.

00:38:09.770 --> 00:38:10.380
SPEAKER 1: We can edit it.

00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:12.213
We could take out the
part of you beating up

00:38:12.213 --> 00:38:13.440
Nick, and whatever you want.

00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:15.090
DAN GABLE: Well,
actually, Nick is

00:38:15.090 --> 00:38:17.730
a guy that has scored some
quick takedowns on me,

00:38:17.730 --> 00:38:19.090
because he's slick.

00:38:19.090 --> 00:38:19.840
And you know what?

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:20.670
I had to learn.

00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:23.030
SPEAKER 1: You OK with us
putting that on YouTube?

00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:23.904
DAN GABLE: Of course.

00:38:23.904 --> 00:38:24.620
Nick Gallo?

00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:25.510
SPEAKER 1: All right.

00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:29.070
DAN GABLE: He already beat my
guy in the national finals,

00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:31.130
so I can give him some credit.

00:38:31.130 --> 00:38:33.140
SPEAKER 1: So we have
a question over here.

00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:35.619
Thank you.

00:38:35.619 --> 00:38:36.410
AUDIENCE: Hey, Dan.

00:38:36.410 --> 00:38:37.035
How's it going?

00:38:37.035 --> 00:38:38.900
Thanks so much for
your words of wisdom.

00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:40.530
You touched a little
bit on nutrition.

00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:43.680
I'm wondering if you have any
recommendations for resources

00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:46.390
for understanding nutrition
that are your favorite resources

00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:47.880
for understanding nutrition?

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:49.750
DAN GABLE: Well, I
usually like to read

00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:53.270
books that are directly
related with wrestling,

00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:56.090
but that's probably
not for the normal.

00:38:56.090 --> 00:38:59.150
But because you have to
be in superior condition

00:38:59.150 --> 00:39:01.470
in wrestling, they're
probably pretty good.

00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:02.970
I used to have-- I
think it's called

00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:06.022
an encyclopedia of health.

00:39:06.022 --> 00:39:07.480
But it was involved
with wrestling.

00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:13.370
But I tell you, there's
so much there, and so easy

00:39:13.370 --> 00:39:18.860
access to get it to, I mean,
you just go online, I think.

00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:21.270
Now here's the thing.

00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:23.280
Here's the thing with it.

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:28.620
And again, there's so
much that isn't good.

00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:31.580
So you've got to
go, like, to really

00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:34.414
a knowledgeable resource.

00:39:34.414 --> 00:39:36.080
Because people are
always trying to make

00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:39.820
money, and a lot of that
stuff isn't for real.

00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:42.460
So you've just got to go
to the general knowledge

00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:43.247
and go from there.

00:39:43.247 --> 00:39:45.080
AUDIENCE: Do you have,
like, a top one, two,

00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:47.000
or three
recommendations in terms

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.260
of maintaining good nutrition?

00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:53.960
DAN GABLE: Just
interview me long enough.

00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:59.100
But actually, I
think for me, it's

00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:03.820
the scientific
point, and not just

00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:05.640
the made-up type of things.

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:09.800
So I really-- I wouldn't
say that-- if you

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:13.240
see something that
looks easy, you

00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:16.365
go back to the
actual science of it.

00:40:16.365 --> 00:40:17.830
SPEAKER 1: So are
you gluten-free?

00:40:17.830 --> 00:40:18.190
DAN GABLE: Hm?

00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:19.520
SPEAKER 1: Are you gluten-free?

00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:22.530
Have you heard of
this Paleo diet?

00:40:22.530 --> 00:40:24.380
DAN GABLE: I'm just a
general science guy.

00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:25.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:27.460
SPEAKER 1: Find the
right scientists.

00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:28.000
DAN GABLE: No, I'm serious.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.090
I'm a general science guy.

00:40:29.090 --> 00:40:33.700
I don't go for these fads.

00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:35.116
SPEAKER 1: One
question over here.

00:40:35.116 --> 00:40:35.710
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:38.560
So you were talking
about adversity a lot,

00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:42.520
and I was wondering if you
have any personal experiences

00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:46.290
or tips or tricks you
have when you're competing

00:40:46.290 --> 00:40:49.480
and you're not performing the
way you wanted to perform,

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:51.220
and you weren't doing your best?

00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:53.549
Do you have a trick to get
yourself to do, again, what

00:40:53.549 --> 00:40:54.840
you want to be doing mid-match?

00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:59.960
DAN GABLE: Well, for me, anytime
I'm experiencing something

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:05.440
that I don't like, I
go the healthy route.

00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:08.062
And that means I go to the gym.

00:41:08.062 --> 00:41:10.270
Or that means I go
to the wrestling mat.

00:41:10.270 --> 00:41:14.490
Some of the worst times
in my life-- and you

00:41:14.490 --> 00:41:17.570
could have laid there
and just keep suffering,

00:41:17.570 --> 00:41:20.760
but I actually got up
and went to the gym.

00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:25.170
And I called somebody up to
get a wrestling match in.

00:41:25.170 --> 00:41:31.460
Or even during the days when
my sister was first murdered,

00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:33.617
it was like, what do you do?

00:41:33.617 --> 00:41:35.200
Everybody came over
to this one house,

00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:36.908
and everybody was just
in this one house.

00:41:36.908 --> 00:41:40.650
And all they did was just kind
of look at each other and talk.

00:41:40.650 --> 00:41:43.000
And I had to get out
and do some exercise.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:49.190
I think exercise is one of the
best things that can actually

00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:52.370
get you in a different frame
of mind, at least temporarily.

00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:56.430
At least temporarily, it will
make you feel a little better.

00:41:56.430 --> 00:41:58.880
And I know that I take
it right on again.

00:41:58.880 --> 00:41:59.680
I take it right on.

00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:03.470
And that's one of the ways
that I've been able to do it.

00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:06.717
AUDIENCE: Also, any
mid-match mentalities?

00:42:06.717 --> 00:42:08.050
You're in the middle of a match.

00:42:08.050 --> 00:42:08.950
DAN GABLE: Oh my gosh.

00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:10.840
If you have to think
during a wrestling match,

00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:11.589
you're in trouble.

00:42:11.589 --> 00:42:13.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:15.590
But I'm going to tell
you what I do sometimes.

00:42:15.590 --> 00:42:17.430
I have had to do it.

00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:21.790
And I talk myself into
performing at a higher level.

00:42:21.790 --> 00:42:24.690
I can remember, I
went in overtime once.

00:42:24.690 --> 00:42:29.060
And I knew I didn't
perform during the match.

00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:32.404
It was kind of a hang-on
match, and I never do that.

00:42:32.404 --> 00:42:33.820
And so when I was
in the corner, I

00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:38.540
was just kind of talking myself
into-- I got a higher level

00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:39.880
that I normally compete at.

00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:43.900
In fact, my athletes
actually, some of them,

00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:48.360
to get their game face on,
wanted me to slap them a lot.

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:51.180
And back in the days-- I hadn't
coached for a long time--

00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:53.520
back in those days, you
could get away with it,

00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:55.700
as long as they told
you you could do it,

00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:57.880
and their mom and dad
told you you could do it.

00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:01.440
But now, today,
they can tell you,

00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:03.580
and you've got to have
a signed agreement,

00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:04.656
and the parents can
tell you, you've

00:43:04.656 --> 00:43:05.490
got to get a signed agreement.

00:43:05.490 --> 00:43:06.630
And then you've got
to go get a lawyer

00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:08.450
and make sure all
this stuff works.

00:43:08.450 --> 00:43:11.420
So it was a little
different than today.

00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:13.409
But I can remember,
I've sometimes

00:43:13.409 --> 00:43:15.200
had to pull a trick or
two out of your hat.

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:18.324
And usually, if you have a
tremendous reputation going

00:43:18.324 --> 00:43:20.490
into that, you can pull a
few tricks out of your hat

00:43:20.490 --> 00:43:22.290
and get away with it.

00:43:22.290 --> 00:43:25.579
But you don't want to have to
count on it too much today.

00:43:25.579 --> 00:43:26.620
AUDIENCE: Thanks so much.

00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:28.660
DAN GABLE: Thank you.

00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:29.814
SPEAKER 1: Please.

00:43:29.814 --> 00:43:31.760
AUDIENCE: Hey, thanks,
Coach, for coming out.

00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:34.260
I have to say, I appreciate
your comment about Mountain Dew.

00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:35.890
I actually gave up
soda when I first

00:43:35.890 --> 00:43:37.470
started cutting in
the eighth grade,

00:43:37.470 --> 00:43:39.560
and I haven't had a sip since.

00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:41.420
I want to say it's like 2004.

00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:43.290
So that's all you've got to do.

00:43:43.290 --> 00:43:46.270
I can't say I took the same
route on beers, though.

00:43:46.270 --> 00:43:47.824
DAN GABLE: Oh, you've
had more beers?

00:43:47.824 --> 00:43:49.240
AUDIENCE: A couple
more than that.

00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:50.160
DAN GABLE: Oh.

00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:52.055
Does it get you
in trouble or not?

00:43:52.055 --> 00:43:53.096
AUDIENCE: No, not at all.

00:43:53.096 --> 00:43:53.684
DAN GABLE: OK.

00:43:53.684 --> 00:43:54.600
You're a good drinker.

00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:55.100
I wasn't.

00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:56.640
AUDIENCE: My
question for you was,

00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:59.440
I think we really appreciate
your story of adversity

00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:01.190
and working through
that yourself.

00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:05.946
But as a coach, how
do you approach maybe

00:44:05.946 --> 00:44:07.320
your athletes,
your wrestlers who

00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:10.019
are going through adversity, how
do you, instead of approaching

00:44:10.019 --> 00:44:11.810
it from your own head,
get out of your head

00:44:11.810 --> 00:44:14.280
and inside your athlete's
head to help them through it?

00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:15.760
How do you approach that?

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:16.620
DAN GABLE: Well, the
number one thing,

00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:18.494
you've got to develop
some kind of a respect.

00:44:18.494 --> 00:44:19.960
And that's on an everyday basis.

00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:22.990
And so over time, they
will look up to you.

00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:24.530
It's just like a parent.

00:44:24.530 --> 00:44:27.017
There's no difference from a
standpoint that if your kids

00:44:27.017 --> 00:44:29.600
just don't-- if you don't treat
them right and don't do things

00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:31.870
right, you're going to
have a lot tougher times.

00:44:31.870 --> 00:44:37.340
So it's a daily thing that
they all of a sudden see

00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:40.490
that they know that
you really care,

00:44:40.490 --> 00:44:42.980
and that you're working
harder than they are.

00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:44.780
That's a real key thing.

00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:48.540
And not necessarily
just during the match

00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:52.570
or during the
practice, but forever.

00:44:52.570 --> 00:44:58.430
It's just that whatever they're
doing in terms of their two

00:44:58.430 --> 00:45:02.000
hours of hard work, you're
putting in 10 hours of work,

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:02.749
or whatever.

00:45:02.749 --> 00:45:04.040
You know, that's another thing.

00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:06.380
Some people don't
like to take home

00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:08.000
what they have to take home.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.405
They like to leave it there,
then come back and get it.

00:45:10.405 --> 00:45:11.530
I'm just going to tell you.

00:45:11.530 --> 00:45:14.196
I've been one of these guys that
I've been able to take it home.

00:45:14.196 --> 00:45:16.076
I've been able to
take it home with me.

00:45:16.076 --> 00:45:19.030
And if I bring it home and it's
not good, then that's not good.

00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:26.180
If I bring it home and
share it and the family

00:45:26.180 --> 00:45:28.839
is on your side, which
my family is on my side.

00:45:28.839 --> 00:45:29.880
That's of the key things.

00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:33.260
I said four, they
were all on my side.

00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:38.820
The 21, including me,
they're all on my side.

00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:41.330
And a lot of it is because
of the amount of success

00:45:41.330 --> 00:45:42.360
too that you're having.

00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:44.950
If you're doing all this and
it's just not successful,

00:45:44.950 --> 00:45:47.630
and it's not good, then you
won't have those people on.

00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:51.964
So I don't know where I
went with that, but anyway,

00:45:51.964 --> 00:45:53.630
didn't I meet you in
the bathroom today?

00:45:53.630 --> 00:45:54.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:54.310 --> 00:45:56.351
AUDIENCE: For context, we
were washing our hands.

00:45:56.351 --> 00:45:57.233
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:57.233 --> 00:45:59.122
Yes sir, you did.

00:45:59.122 --> 00:46:01.580
SPEAKER 1: I love that we have
a handful of wrestlers here.

00:46:01.580 --> 00:46:05.510
I want to save a time for
people to buy books and give

00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:07.300
autographs.

00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:09.076
We'll finish right
after this question.

00:46:09.076 --> 00:46:10.620
DAN GABLE: No,
they've got two more.

00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:11.250
SPEAKER 1: Two more.

00:46:11.250 --> 00:46:12.583
DAN GABLE: Three more, actually.

00:46:12.583 --> 00:46:13.740
AUDIENCE: Hey Dan.

00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:17.060
So what fascinates me
about successful athletes

00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:18.800
is not getting to the top.

00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:21.547
It's how long they
can stay at the top.

00:46:21.547 --> 00:46:23.130
And I'd like to hear
a little bit more

00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:25.890
from you about what
drove you or what

00:46:25.890 --> 00:46:29.950
motivated you to
continue to get better

00:46:29.950 --> 00:46:32.260
after so many years of success.

00:46:32.260 --> 00:46:34.120
DAN GABLE: Well, I
really do believe

00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:36.250
that if you don't
have a lot of success,

00:46:36.250 --> 00:46:38.014
you're going to
fall off somewhere,

00:46:38.014 --> 00:46:39.680
and you're not going
to keep that drive.

00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:43.670
And I do feel that the
drive from the success

00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:45.822
really helped me.

00:46:45.822 --> 00:46:49.650
And at the crucial times of--
I had all this winning, then

00:46:49.650 --> 00:46:52.786
I had a loss, that's
a major adversity.

00:46:52.786 --> 00:46:55.650
But it's just that you
have so much success,

00:46:55.650 --> 00:46:57.120
you know what that
feeling's like.

00:46:57.120 --> 00:47:00.830
And when you don't have it,
it's kind of devastating.

00:47:00.830 --> 00:47:04.070
So I think you do have to
be successful a lot to be

00:47:04.070 --> 00:47:07.420
able to sustain it, sustain it.

00:47:07.420 --> 00:47:09.460
It's one of these
things, you get up there.

00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:18.500
I think I say that my low point
is like at most people's peaks.

00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:23.280
And because by that, I mean
when I drop down a little bit,

00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:25.780
you know, it's still higher
than almost everybody

00:47:25.780 --> 00:47:31.010
else in my work ethic or
my smartness for my sport.

00:47:31.010 --> 00:47:33.900
And on a daily basis, when
you're up at that level.

00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:35.870
You've got to have--
you can't stay up there.

00:47:35.870 --> 00:47:37.120
I don't like to
use the word can't.

00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:38.060
I shouldn't say that.

00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:41.030
But you know, it's
like, you still

00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:44.440
have to have what's called-- and
again, this is really critical,

00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:47.370
and I can't believe I
haven't pointed this out--

00:47:47.370 --> 00:47:51.070
because this, you have to
have what's called recovery.

00:47:51.070 --> 00:47:53.760
And people say, I'm going
to go fishing once a month

00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:55.400
or once a year.

00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:57.350
That's going to recover
me for the year.

00:47:57.350 --> 00:48:02.720
Or I'm going to go do
something, and I'll

00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:05.080
be ready to go for another year.

00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:07.920
Hey, it's every day.

00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:11.390
My recovery is every day.

00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:13.800
So what was I doing this
morning when I first got up?

00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:16.750
Well, I was in the steam room.

00:48:16.750 --> 00:48:18.960
I was in the sauna.

00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:22.100
I got a massage.

00:48:22.100 --> 00:48:25.610
You know, it's
like, I do things.

00:48:25.610 --> 00:48:27.310
And that's one of the keys.

00:48:27.310 --> 00:48:31.754
So when I come home
from work, I do

00:48:31.754 --> 00:48:33.670
things that are going
to help me recover to be

00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:35.550
ready to go for the next day.

00:48:35.550 --> 00:48:38.520
Most of them are,
like, for wrestling.

00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:40.330
But it's your whole life.

00:48:40.330 --> 00:48:43.020
So it could be my
homework when I was a kid.

00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:44.430
You know, that type of thing.

00:48:44.430 --> 00:48:46.320
But I can recover really quick.

00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:47.360
Really quick.

00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:50.560
And part of that recovery is
because I did a lot of things

00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:53.360
to my body and mind
that nobody else did.

00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:55.802
So practice was
over, I stayed after.

00:48:55.802 --> 00:48:57.510
But then I went through
all these things.

00:48:57.510 --> 00:48:59.970
Hot, cold plunges, hot plunges.

00:48:59.970 --> 00:49:04.540
You know, if somebody was
there in college for a massage.

00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:06.610
Just, I'd work on that,
but I didn't really

00:49:06.610 --> 00:49:08.870
know what I was doing
until I became a coach.

00:49:08.870 --> 00:49:11.430
And then you kind of
diagnose it, dissect it.

00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:13.370
And then you say, this is it.

00:49:13.370 --> 00:49:16.410
So my teams could
work extremely hard.

00:49:16.410 --> 00:49:17.912
This team can work
extremely hard.

00:49:17.912 --> 00:49:19.870
And you can come back
and do it again tomorrow,

00:49:19.870 --> 00:49:23.180
and you're totally recovered,
because you have a recovery

00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:23.680
process.

00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:26.280
So like I said, when I
wanted to go fishing,

00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:28.040
I had this cabin up
north in Minnesota.

00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:30.720
But I only get up there
three weeks a year,

00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:32.170
maybe two weeks a year.

00:49:32.170 --> 00:49:34.477
And all at the same time.

00:49:34.477 --> 00:49:35.310
So guess what I did?

00:49:35.310 --> 00:49:38.010
I built myself a
cabin in my backyard.

00:49:38.010 --> 00:49:41.090
So I go to my retreat every day.

00:49:41.090 --> 00:49:44.590
Plus, the fact that once
I retired from coaching,

00:49:44.590 --> 00:49:47.410
you know, I still wanted to
work on my sport and my life,

00:49:47.410 --> 00:49:50.807
my wife's house was
her house, you know?

00:49:50.807 --> 00:49:52.390
And so she kind of
said, why don't you

00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:53.762
build one just real close?

00:49:53.762 --> 00:49:55.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:55.410 --> 00:49:59.480
But, you know, it's like, I've
never had to sleep in it-- yet.

00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:00.720
But there is a bed there.

00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:01.990
SPEAKER 1: We'll have
to create our own cabin

00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:03.440
in one of these [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:06.280
For the remaining two questions,
feel free to just approach.

00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:09.660
Let's give Dan a thank
you, a round of applause.

00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:11.040
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:11.790
Books in the back.

00:50:11.790 --> 00:50:12.750
We'll do book signings.

00:50:12.750 --> 00:50:15.140
We'll be here for 10 minutes.
