00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.000
Hey it's me Destin welcome back to Smarter Every Day. So I've been learning a lot about guns underwater,

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.020
which is pretty cool. I mean, in the first video I learned all about what's happening back here

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.050
in the action. But the problem is because of limitations in my setup I didn't get to see

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.070
what happened when the bullet exits and goes into the water. Now I really want to see that,

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.090
so I had to think about it for a while and I had an ah-ha moment. You see instead of building an aquarium

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.120
that was keeping the water in with the gun, I built this, to keep the water out.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.700
But the problem is, even though I built all this cool stuff and got my hands on one of the

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.700
best high speed cameras on the market, I didn't have enough hands to run it all.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.730
So I invited some friends to help me.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.730
 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.880
It's gonna work.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Sickeningly good.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:43.770
(Destin) I was hoping to get

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.820
the widest view possible, that we can get inside that mirror.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.830
- So, we're gonna have to be as close to the mirror as possible with the wide angle otherwise we'll see the rig won't we.
- I think so.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.850
(Destin) What kind of lens do you think you're gonna use?
- Lens...

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.870
So you're gonna be in the middle.
- So we should have a lens, shouldn't we? [laughs]
- We should have a lens. [laugh]

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.910
- The problem with doing an AK under water is that

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.940
I can't trigger the camera, so that's the Slow Mo Guys who've come to help me.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.980
So what are you gonna run?
- Run the Phantom v1610 today which goes up to

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
18,000 frames per second at 720p.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.050
- I can't count that high.
- Definitely more than.. you've got fingers.

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.070
- Can you zip me?
- Unless you're from Alabama.
- Alright just to show you how cold

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.100
it is when we're doing this, that's about 40 degrees.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.130
And it is cooold. So the camera's gonna look into the top mirror, it's gonna bounce down

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.160
and then basically it's a periscope under water. I've got the gun here...

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.170
You can see it there, with the phantom.

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.180
[gun cocking]

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.280
 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.200
[gunshot]

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.240

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.980

[slowed down gunshot]

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.980
 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.390
[multiple bangs]

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.410
Alright, it has been very consistent. We're getting about

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.450
5-6 feet of bullet travel.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.680
 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.470
[gunshot]

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.480
 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.520
[slowed down gunshot]

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:44.700
 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.640
[slowed down gunshot]

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:58.490
 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.690
[bangs]

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.700
 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.730
[gun clearing]
OK. So, what did we just learn?

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.790
You can see that there's gas that comes out right here. It's a little gas bubble.

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.830
And the reason that's happening is because it's.. the piston is venting just

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.850
when it gets past... [laugh] I can't talk I'm freezing. As the bullet goes

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.890
down the barrel it passes this gas block and pushes gas against this piston.

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.910
Now you can see it starts to move the bolt but watch what happens.

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.950
Right there, it opens up this little gas port. That's why there's a bubble right

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.990
there during the shot. So if we take this off, you can see that the piston

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.010
vents after it goes only about a 1/4 of an inch back. If you think about

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.050
it that's cool because this very short pressure impulse is enough to overcome all the springs

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.070
and the friction in the weapon and cycle it, simply due to inertial forces.

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.110
[gunshot]

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.110
 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:55.480
[gunshot] [water spray]

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.540
 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.160
Oh gee.. it's cold.
[laughter]

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.180
Alright, so... So now we're gonna do over the shoulder?

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.820
- Yeah, yeah. Over the shoulder shot.
- Alright.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.230
(Destin) All clear to load?
- Clear to load.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.980
 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.260
- Clear to fire?

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:23.290
- Clear to fire.
- 3.. 2.. 1.. [gunshot]

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.300
(Destin) Weapon's clear.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.320
- Ohh.

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.620
 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.370
- Did you get it?
- I got it. I'll go check it.

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.080
 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.400
[slowed down gunshot]

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:42.030
 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:50.490
[multiple bangs]

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:56.020
 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.560
[slowed down gunshot]

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.590
[music]

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:21.470
    

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.790
[slowed down gunshot]

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:35.270
  

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:39.990
[bangs]

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:43.790
 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.890
[underwater gunshot]

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:57.030
 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.980
Yeah. I know that was gonna be cool, but not that cool. Let me try to explain what I think's going on here.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.990
So we got this oscillation that you can see after the shot in the bubbles. That's awesome.

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:10.030
I didn't understand why the bubble would start back up after it collapsed. But here's what's going on.

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:14.060
There's an equation called the Rayleigh-Plesset Equation that describes everything a bubble does under water.

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.110
It's too hard to solve by hand, you've gotta use computers to figure it out but this is basically what's going on.

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:22.130
At the initiation point you have a super high pressure inside of a bubble and it begins to

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:26.160
impart momentum to the fluid around it so it begins to grow. At some point

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.190
it passes the point where the pressure inside the bubble is equal to the pressure outside the bubble and it continues

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:34.220
to grow until eventually the water stops it. Now at this point you have low pressure

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.250
inside and high pressure outside so it begins to collapse again, and because of fluid momentum

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:42.280
it goes again beyond that equilibrium point and begins to compress.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:46.300
So it gets a super high pressure on the inside again and boom, another shock wave

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.340
and the process starts all over again. This oscillation occurs until you dissipate

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.380
all the kinetic energy in the system. Now at this point of

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.420
tightest closure, you have the highest pressure. At this point sometimes something can occur

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:02.460
called sonoluminescence. Sonoluminescence occurs when you get a flash of light

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:06.490
when a cavitation bubble is collapsing. Now as much as I want to believe this

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:10.530
is sonoluminescence I'm pretty sure it's just a really cool reflection from the sunlight above the pool.

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:14.540
But it's still really interesting that it occurs at the point of collapse. I wonder why

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.560
that's happening. OK there's something else we need to talk about. This is my favourite shot.

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:22.610
Originally I thought that the first gases out of the barrel were from where the bullet

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:26.630
exits and the expanding gases from the cartridge flowed around it, but look again.

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:30.630
Do you see that black colour trailing down the length of the bubble? That's the burnt gunpowder being

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:34.640
released from the barrel behind the bullet. So if you follow that powder down the bubble, it should

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:38.640
line up with that bullet. Yeah, there it is. So what's the first white cloud then?

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:42.650
If you have a flowing liquid and you speed it up, the pressure of that fluid drops.

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:46.700
Now it seems a little bit backwards from how it should be, but this is what happens. It's called

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:50.740
the Bernoulli principle, where flow is high and pressure's low. So let's look at this

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:54.750
phase diagram for water. The water we were in was about 4 degrees celcius and about

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:58.770
1 atmosphere. If we drop the pressure of the water below a certain point

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:02.790
the water turns to vapour. The inside of the barrel was full of water before we

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:06.810
shot right? And so the bullet pushed it out at a very high speed. So where

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:10.830
flow is high, pressure's low. Cavitation is happening in the barrel on the

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:14.860
front side of the bullet. I'm still trying to wrap my head around this but there it is. 

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:18.880
You can actually see it in the video. Once the bullet punches out of this cavitation cloud something else

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:22.900
is happening. You'll notice that the bubble on the right looks like a cloud and the bubble

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:26.940
on the left looks more like glass. Andrew Davidhazy took some awesome

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:30.950
shatter graphs of bullets in flight which show the shock wave on the front of the bullet. The area behind

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:34.980
the shock wave is lower in pressure. It turns to vapour. Because this

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.010
low pressure region has a smoother flow boundary it looks more like glass

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:43.040
instead of the fuzzy cloud look caused by the turbulent flow coming out of the barrel. So there you have it.

00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:47.040
You're not just shooting a bullet out of this gun, you're shooting three different things.

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:51.050
Now that we understand the physics behind cavitation you can clearly see the effects of each of these three

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:55.100
components in the high speed video. Oh yeah, and we also understand bubble bounce now too don't we.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:59.130
So a huge thank you to Gavin and Dan the man from the Slow Mo Guys. They came all the

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:03.170
way to Alabama to help me shoot this video. That's a pretty big deal. So we re-did a video

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:07.220
on their channel, something I did a while back, pistols under water, only we used a v1610.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:11.230
It's awesome. Go check it out on their channel, it's totally worth your time.

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:15.250
On my channel the intent here was to make an awesome video that you enjoyed and you also learn something, and

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:19.270
perhaps earn your subscription. So, if you think I got close, we got a little chemistry going on,

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:23.300
check out part 3 of this video, Russian frogmen guns. Yeah, they exist.

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:27.340
So I got my hands on some of those. I still have the ninja scope 3000 or whatever we're gonna call that thing.

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:31.380
You kinda see where this is going. Anyway, I'm Destin, you're getting Smarter Every Day,

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:35.400
have a good one. So we actually selected this pool for a reason.

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:39.450
Jimmy Neutron lives in the middle of nowhere, so if the bullet got away from us, everybody down range would be safe.

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:43.490
Please be smart, don't try this. So check out how he cuts the glass.

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:47.520
[scratching]
Huh?

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:51.560
[snap]
(Destin) What? What did he just do?!

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:55.600
[laughs]
(Destin) Get away from my computer, get away from my computer!

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:59.610
Alright we got the bullets. There was no damage but

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:02.620
you can definitely see the grooves from the rifling in the barrel.
