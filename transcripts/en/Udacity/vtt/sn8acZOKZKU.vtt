As we mentioned earlier, OCD used to appear in the DSM with other anxiety

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:11.274
disorders, however, in the DSM-5, OCD is in its own category. Now, remember at

00:00:11.274 --> 00:00:15.026
the beginning of the lesson we cautioned people from diagnosing themselves and

00:00:15.026 --> 00:00:18.722
this is one disorder where I have seen people mislabel and call themselves OCD,

00:00:18.722 --> 00:00:24.385
when in fact they do not have OCD. For example, I've heard students say oh, for

00:00:24.385 --> 00:00:29.275
all my classes I have to color-coordinate the folders and assignments. I'm so

00:00:29.275 --> 00:00:35.638
OCD. Being neat, tidy, and organized is not the same as having OCD. So what is

00:00:35.638 --> 00:00:37.790
OCD? Let's take a closer look.
