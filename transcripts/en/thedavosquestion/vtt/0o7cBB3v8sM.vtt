&gt;&gt;Hi, I'm Ann Veneman.
I'm the Executive Director of UNICEF.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.810
One of the issues we've been talking about
here at the World Economic

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:15.349
Forum is the issue of Haiti and the devastation
from the earthquake.

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:18.910
Of course, as the United Nations' children's
agency, we are most

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.980
concerned about the plight of children.
How does -- how do children get back into

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.970
school, for example?
Only 50 percent of the children were going

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.449
to school before the
earthquake.

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.170
One of the things in the process of rebuilding
the country not only has

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.660
to be the investment of businesses here -- those
businesses who are

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.600
committed here at Davos -- but also to rebuild
education systems,

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.710
health care systems, make sure the children
of Haiti are protected.
