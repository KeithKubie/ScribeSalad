00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:03.900
In this video,
we're going to show you

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.589
how to make frozen hot chocolate,

00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:07.160
a delicious summertime treat.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.800
[Music]

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.240
To get started making this
delicious frozen hot chocolate,

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.700
you're probably going to need
a quick trip to the grocery store,

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.520
although none of the
ingredients are too crazy.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.080
Here's the ingredients we'll need.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.630
A bar of your favorite chocolate,

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.260
about 4 and 1/2 ounces,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.580
some of your favorite hot cocoa mix,

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.320
regular white sugar,

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.820
some heavy whipping cream,

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:31.780
some milk,

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.500
and if you want to add a little bit
of extra sweetness to your dessert,

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.560
some whipped cream.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.240
For today, here's the basic idea.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.120
After whipping up a
few batches of our recipe,

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.330
we'll show you how to produce
the frozen hot chocolate

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.520
using a blender,
an ice cream machine,

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.330
a Ziploc bag full of ice,

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.740
or if you happen to have it,
some liquid nitrogen.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.180
With all of our ingredients gathered,

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.230
let's make our first batch,

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.660
and throw it in
the ice cream machine.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.380
Oh, no golden ticket.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.180
Let's start by chopping up
our chocolate bar

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.240
into a bunch of
really small pieces.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.080
[Music]

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.700
We want to melt all of our
chocolate in a double boiler.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.140
That's when you take one pan,

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.340
and put it in another pan
that's full of water.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.760
This prevents the pan
with the chocolate

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.840
from overheating and
burning your chocolate.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:22.780
[Music]

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.820
Once you have a smooth creamy
consistency in your chocolate,

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.320
it's time to add the next ingredients.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.920
2 tablespoons of hot cocoa powder,

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.640
and 1 and 1/2 tablespoons of sugar.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.260
Stir that in until you have
a uniform consistency.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.480
It won't be as smooth as it was before.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:45.740
[Music]

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.660
Once the sugar and
hot cocoa are mixed in,

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:48.670
let's take it off the heat,

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.160
and add 1/2 cup
of heavy whipping cream.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:58.380
[Music]

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.960
At this point,
I find that a whisk

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.960
works a little bit
better than a spatula.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.900
[Music]

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.341
With the cream thoroughly mixed in,

00:02:08.341 --> 00:02:10.020
now let's add one cup of milk.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:19.460
[Music]

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.340
At this point, what we have
is a deliciously rich, extremely

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.380
chocolatey mixture that's
frankly a little too strong.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.480
You wouldn't want to eat this plain,

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.880
except maybe a teaspoonful
about that size

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.600
because it's really really potent.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.280
So what we actually
need to do now

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.700
is water it down with water.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.500
Let's add 1 and 1/2 cups
of water into our mixture.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.000
[Music]

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.320
With the water diluting it,

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.420
it tastes like an extremely delicious,

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.300
but room temperature hot chocolate.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.680
So cool hot chocolate?

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.920
Cool chocolate?

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.580
Un-hot chocolate.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.580
Let's make it cold.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.079
Guys today's video
is sponsored by Blue Apron.

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:04.079
If you've never heard of them,

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:07.290
they are a food delivery company
that sends you all of the ingredients

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.080
and recipes you need
to make meals right in your home.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.480
So many ingredients.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.200
It's a really cool and convenient service

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.099
that's currently offering $50 off
of your first two weeks of food

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:20.120
for the first hundred people
to sign up with the link

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.120
down in the description.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.540
One of my favorite
things about Blue Apron

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.329
is that for every box you get,

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.209
you can actually choose from
a collection of eight different recipes,

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.339
and you can select
the ones that you want.

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:30.560
I've got these three right here,

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.620
the sesame chicken noodles,

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.160
the steak and spicy butter,

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.260
and the blackened ginger pork burgers.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.769
I am a huge fan of burgers,

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.079
so for today, I'm going
to be trying out with this one.

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:42.479
I love the little bottles.

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:44.489
They give you all the
sauces and stuff you need,

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.820
and they're just like
portioned out just the right size.

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:47.760
That's awesome.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:04:02.320
[Music]

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.980
I love burgers.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:13.860
[Music]

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:14.920
Yeah.

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.040
Oh, these smells so good.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.200
[Music]

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.220
Oh, this burger looks so good.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.030
It's got sauce kind of
running down the sides of it,

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.440
but I'm okay with it.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.260
[Music]

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.240
I don't have a ton of
experience with pork burgers,

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.380
but this is really good.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.600
Like, that's another great thing is,

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.440
like it comes to these recipes,

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.560
expand your horizons.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.200
Like learn new foods,

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.220
try them out,

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.380
and make them yourself, it's even cooler.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:45.520
Guys, this is amazing.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.020
Check the link in the description.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.431
The first hundred people
to sign up will get $50 off

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.840
of their first
two weeks of food.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:52.920
I highly recommend the burgers.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.160
If you've never used one of
these ice cream machines before,

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.180
they're pretty simple.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.120
This container goes in
the freezer for several hours

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.060
to lower the temperature quite a bit,

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.620
and then it just holds your liquid
while it spins in this machine.

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.140
Let's turn this on,
and pour in our mix.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:14.300
[Music]

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.120
The ice cream machine
method is very simple,

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.120
but it does take some time,

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.300
and while that's running,

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.640
let's get our next batch started.

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.090
[Music]

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.140
This time, we're using the blender recipe,

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:26.720
and with the blender recipe,

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.460
we now need to add three
cups of ice into our blender,

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.280
and then pour our mixture over that.

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.400
We don't add any water because
the melting ice will dilute it enough.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:43.300
[Music]

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.160
Once we blend up the ice,

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.880
this version of the frozen
hot chocolate is complete.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.140
Cheers.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.140
[Music]

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:55.400
The blender version gives
a much thinner consistency

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.090
than the other three methods.

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:58.490
So if you want a
version that you drink,

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.040
rather than eat with a spoon,

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.260
this is the way to go.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.360
Oh it's so good.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:06.539
There we go.

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.240
It has taken maybe 15-ish minutes,

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.780
and at this point,

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.889
our ice cream machine's
frozen hot chocolate

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:17.380
is just the right consistency.

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:25.700
[Music]

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:26.700
That's so good.

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:39.120
I can do this all day.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.900
As you can see, the ice cream maker
does give us a little bit thicker

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.440
of a consistency than when
we make it in the blender.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.180
For our next method, we're going
to be using something you may have done

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.120
if you've ever made ice cream at home.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.919
That involves putting what
we're going to freeze in a Ziploc bag,

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:56.020
and putting that bag
inside of a bigger bag,

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.680
and filling the bigger
bag full of ice and salt.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:03.960
I have here a 1 gallon freezer bag,
and a 2 gallon freezer bag.

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:06.620
So we've got our smaller one gallon bag.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.259
We're going to pour
our mix into there

00:07:08.259 --> 00:07:10.949
after adding the cream,
the milk, and the water.

00:07:10.949 --> 00:07:12.789
That's about 3 cups of cool liquid.

00:07:12.789 --> 00:07:14.540
So this is just room temperature.

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:16.980
We don't have to worry
about it melting the bag, or anything.

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:20.710
[Music]

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:23.020
Squeeze out as much of the air as we can.

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:26.780
Now, we just have a
bag full of liquid chocolate.

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.500
Now, we have our bag
of ice and a bunch of salt,

00:07:29.509 --> 00:07:30.920
I'm using ice cream salt,

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:32.779
you can use other salt if you like.

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:34.400
It should all work just as well.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:41.560
[Music]

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.819
Using about 8 cups of ice,

00:07:43.819 --> 00:07:46.580
and now, we'll add about
one cup of our salt.

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:50.080
[Music]

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.500
Get the salt and ice nice
and mixed up together,

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.560
and now we take our smaller bag,

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:59.060
put it inside our larger bag.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.540
Let's just make sure it's
nice and covered with our ice.

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:05.860
[Music]

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:10.440
I'm going to try and suck some
of the extra air out of this bag as well.

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:16.720
[Music]

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.000
That way all the ice should
pretty well stay in contact

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000
with the bag inside.

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:23.480
And at this point, we just
need to start mixing it up.

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:26.760
We shake it,
and we squish it,

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:27.960
and scrunch it.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:31.080
and just move it around
because we want all that salty ice

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:32.649
to be cooling down the mixture,

00:08:32.649 --> 00:08:34.579
and we don't want it
to present to a solid piece.

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:37.080
We want it to freeze into a nice slush.

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:40.440
With this method, you can kind of
choose the consistency that you want.

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:41.919
If you want it to be thicker,

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:44.620
just keep it moving around in your
ice and salt for a little bit longer.

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.820
A little bit more of
a drinkable consistency,

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:47.840
just take it out sooner.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.900
[Music]

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:52.960
After about 10 minutes of mixing
our hot chocolate around

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.840
inside that salty ice,

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:59.380
we have what is most definitely
not that same liquid consistency.

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:01.680
Now, let's rinse this off
so we don't accidentally end up

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.010
getting salt in our hot chocolate,

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:05.500
and scoop it out,
and see what it looks like.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.200
Of course I do want 
to rinse it very quickly

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.780
so I don't warm it back up.

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:21.060
[Music]

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:23.660
We have one more method to try,

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:25.360
and that is using liquid nitrogen.

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.600
Let's whip up one more batch,

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:30.400
and see how quickly we can make
frozen hot chocolate using that.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:40.840
[Music]

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:41.850
There's our chocolatey base.

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:43.621
Now, let's add some
liquid nitrogen to it,

00:09:43.621 --> 00:09:46.140
and see if we can
flash freeze this sucker.

00:09:46.140 --> 00:10:01.580
[Music]

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:04.060
All of the liquid nitrogen
down inside our mixture

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:06.490
bubbling up is giving
it a really interesting

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:08.160
frothy texture on top.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:19.200
[Music]

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.080
As you can see, all four
of these methods work great.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.860
Some people are going
to have an ice cream maker,

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:24.620
some people won't.

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:26.040
I think most people
will have a blender,

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:29.520
but if not, Ziploc bags are
really easy to get your hands on,

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.180
and that method works just as well.

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.240
Of course, if you want
to get really fancy with it,

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:36.400
you can start adding things
like whipped cream and garnishes.

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.020
Figure out which method
works best for you,

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:41.100
and enjoy a cool, refreshing
chocolate treat this summer.

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:44.660
[Music]

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:48.860
Mine.

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.440
Guys, there's still
more for you to see.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.680
That box up there will transport
you directly to our last video,

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:54.780
and you should go check it out.

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:56.579
The box down at the bottom
will show you what YouTube thinks

00:10:56.579 --> 00:10:57.579
you should be watching next,

00:10:57.579 --> 00:10:59.560
and this bomb right here
will subscribe to our channel,

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:01.200
so you never miss another video.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.380
Don't forget to ring that bell,

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:03.200
and we'll see you in the next one.

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:03.880
Talk to you then.
