00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.230
Ahmad Tejan Kabbah: Mr. Chairperson,
distinguished, faculty and students, of the

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:21.230
Columbia University, distinguished ladies
and gentlemen. I thank this school of international

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:28.980
and public affairs for the invitation at this
forum and for your kind words of introduction.

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:36.869
I understand that last year, Columbia University
celebrated its 250th anniversary. Let me extend,

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:51.030
albeit belatedly, sincere congratulations
to the entire university community. It is

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:59.940
fascinating that a 250 year old, at 250 years
old, Columbia is still going strong and maintaining

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:13.560
its exemplary standard of academic excellence.\
There are few countries whose leaders in public

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:21.719
life, business, science, and

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:28.429
humanities have not had some association
with Columbia University. Indeed,

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:32.569
there is hardly any country that has not

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:35.020
benefited from Columbia's outstanding

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:41.600
contribution to knowledge. Over they years,
many (inaudible) have been

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.139
fortunate enough to be a part of this

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:51.109
fine institution, both as students and staff.

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:58.109
Incidentally, my son obtained his degree
in this university. It is an honor to be

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:05.179
here at Columbia University and to speak

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:11.250
at the World Leaders Forum this

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.930
morning.
I thank you for this singular honor. This

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.860
form serves as a center for open dialogue

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:28.390
with world leaders, but I believe it also
provides a friendly environment for

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.310
learning for learning. In other words,

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.630
it provides some opportunity for the

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:43.630
audience some lessons learned in such
areas as war and peace, economic and

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.670
social development, and international

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.720
cooperation. We in Sierra Leone have

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:58.210
learned many challenges,

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:03.590
lessons over the past 14 years. I would like
to share

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.140
with you a few, mainly, conflict management,

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:15.140
and post conflict development.\
It is our experience in resolving conflicts

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.370
and literally building a bridge between

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:26.370
post conflict recovery and sustainable
development. While taking you through

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.710
conflict, we'll reflect finally on development

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.850
in this weapon free comfort zone of

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:41.320
Columbia University. I look forward to
learning through exchange of views on

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.740
these matters. You may be aware that Sierra

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.590
Leone has endured a decade long

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:56.150
internal conflict in the 1990's that unleashed
a campaign of unimaginable

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.970
bloodshed and devastation. I will not

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.030
recount here in full detail the extraordinary

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:12.890
brutality and immense suffering visited
upon the people of my country during the

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.100
course of the conflict, which left hundreds

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.470
of thousands dead and many more

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:26.440
grotesquely maimed.
The conflict also devastated our infrastructure.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.690
As a result, this senseless

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.889
violence and wanton destruction, the conflict
in Sierra Leone became

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:38.070
internationally known for its horrific

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.570
atrocities, particularly the widespread

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:48.420
amputation of civilians and sexual violence
perpetrated against innocent women

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.930
and children. Prior to the outbreak of

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.880
the armed conflict, Sierra Leone was not

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:02.880
only a developing country, but also one
of the least developed in the world. It still

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:11.480
is. Here, the 11-year rebel conflict only

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:20.220
exacerbated an already fragile economy.
However, the killing and maiming were abated

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:29.950
and the guns were silenced by our

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:36.370
commit to end the conflict and the will
of the people for a return to democratic

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.590
governance. Today, one of our greatest

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.260
achievements is our adherence to the

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:50.300
tenants of democracy and the rule of law.
Upon assuming the presidency in

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:55.180
March 1996, my own personal experience

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:59.370
in post conflict recovery, as a UNDP

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:04.160
representative and resident coordinator
of the United Nation system is East and

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.360
South Africa was put to the test in my

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:13.350
own country. I inherited a severely battered

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:19.020
nation.
I was conscious of my political, constitutional,

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.750
and also moral obligation and

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:28.750
strive hard and give every effort to bring
an early end to the war. The population

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:37.389
had already become war weary and in spirit

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:40.540
of my knowledge of the state of our

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:47.540
military and its inability to prosecute
the war against the rebels, I made the

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:55.660
enduring, the ending of the war, my campaign

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:01.650
pledge. I made this pledge in the

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:08.080
belief, by negotiations or sound reasoning,
I would be able to talk the rebels out

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.169
of their hostile activities against a

00:07:11.169 --> 00:07:16.760
population and persuade them to enter into

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:21.729
negotiations with a few concluding peace
agreements with them.

00:07:21.729 --> 00:07:28.729
In fact, the only option I saw available to
me then was to embark on negotiations

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:35.139
with the rebels. Accordingly, that is

00:07:35.139 --> 00:07:38.500
the approach that I pursued immediately after

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:45.500
my inauguration, despite the existent
problems concerning the capability of the

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:48.850
military and the fact that I was elected

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:51.330
president against a background of

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:58.330
increasing confidence of the eventual
ascendancy to power of the rebel group,

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:01.639
known as the Revolutionary United Front,

00:08:01.639 --> 00:08:06.669
RUF. A cross section of my people,

00:08:06.669 --> 00:08:12.680
including the print media, was against
negotiations with the rebels. But I knew

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:17.509
that the then army, not the people, had

00:08:17.509 --> 00:08:22.990
lost the war.
And since the people were not competent in

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:26.350
the strict sense of the word, I

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:33.350
convinced them into talking with the rebels.
It was an uphill task. The areas

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:38.800
manifests hostility toward my government

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:42.979
had been further increased. Insistence

00:08:42.979 --> 00:08:49.790
on elections before peace. This caused
the area a considerable sense of

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:54.770
frustration. Both of these factors, though

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:59.800
not fatal, will prove the weakening, the

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:04.270
baddening position of my government when
it entered the *Abidjan peace talks

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:10.460
with the (inaudible) in late 1996. In

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:13.240
Abidjan, a comprehensive peace agreement

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:20.240
was included despite all the acrimony
engendered by the rebels during

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.580
negotiations.

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:28.050
The agreement called for, among other things,
the total and immediate cessation

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:31.940
of hostilities, the disarmament demobilization,

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:35.360
and reintegration of all combatants

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:42.360
and the provision of amnesty for the (inaudible)
members. The people

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:44.680
(inaudible) welcomed the signing of this

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:48.310
agreement, as they regarded the accord

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:54.450
as the end of their woes and suffering
and expected that it will restore lasting

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:57.610
peace and stability to the country. It

00:09:57.610 --> 00:10:01.910
soon turned out, however, that the people

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:08.910
and the government had in fact been deceived
by the (inaudible). The message

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:12.540
of the rebel leader, intercepted by the

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:15.410
government, only days after the signing of

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:21.220
the agreement, clearly showed that the
*Ariyaf did not enter the peace

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:23.440
negotiations in good faith and had no

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:26.779
desire to abide by the term's resulting

00:10:26.779 --> 00:10:32.940
peace agreement.
And that message, for the (inaudible), the

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:35.580
rebel leader had communicated with

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:42.270
his deputy, the field commander *Sam Bokari,
alias Mosquito that he had agreed

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:45.450
to participate in negotiation and to sign

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:49.170
the peace agreement only as a pretext to

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:55.350
relieve himself of the pressure of the
international community. But he never

00:10:55.350 --> 00:11:01.430
intended to abide by its terms. In the

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:04.130
same message, he ordered his

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:10.410
commanders to resolve hostilities, even
with greater ferocity. Indeed, the cease

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:15.620
fire, which then prevailed, was then broken

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:18.010
by the Ariyaf immediately after the

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:24.350
signing on the agreement. A clear indication
that the Abidjan agreement was

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:27.930
doomed on fail. Attacks on civilians by

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:34.930
the Ariyafs stepped up over time.
In March 1997, military officers adopted the

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:40.980
name Armed Forces Revolutionary

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:47.500
Council, in collaboration with Ariyaf
rebels, and stages a bloody coup in Fretown,

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:51.700
the capital of Sierra Leone. My government

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:54.430
went into exile in neighboring

00:11:54.430 --> 00:12:00.149
Guinea, from where we operated and mobilized
international support for the

00:12:00.149 --> 00:12:03.560
immediate and unconditional restoration

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:07.589
of democratic rule. The people of Sierra

00:12:07.589 --> 00:12:14.589
Leone overwhelming rejoiced and rejected
the coup, some with their lives. In

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:21.959
response to the Ariyaf in transience and

00:12:21.959 --> 00:12:25.700
its increasing brutality against civilians,

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:32.700
Nigeria led a (inaudible) observer group.
Troops launched an offensive in February 1998

00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:39.830
to dislodge the *Jaunter. The

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:46.830
joint (inaudible) were forced out of Fretown
and my government was there after

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:51.149
restored. During the intervention, my

00:12:51.149 --> 00:12:55.720
(inaudible), many of the Farseian area

00:12:55.720 --> 00:13:02.050
\f0 forces escaped to the remote hinterlands
of the country and intensified their

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:04.839
activities predominantly in the diamond

00:13:04.839 --> 00:13:09.709
mining areas. There, they were able to

00:13:09.709 --> 00:13:14.870
mine diamonds which they exchanged cheaply
with weapons, which they armed

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:18.750
themselves to the teeth. This enabled

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:23.500
them to recoup, to regroup, and attack the

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:30.500
capital in January 1999. Slaughtering
thousands of civilians and virtually razing

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:35.610
the city in a matter of days.

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:41.420
This level of mayhem and destruction further
awakens (inaudible) general

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:45.839
international awareness of the plight

00:13:45.839 --> 00:13:51.360
of the civilian population. That incursion

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:58.360
accelerated the dire need for the peace
process. In collaboration with the

00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:01.660
economic committee of West African states,

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:04.589
a course, an international committee

00:14:04.589 --> 00:14:11.339
was now willing to intervene, at least
diplomatically. And they, together, with the

00:14:11.339 --> 00:14:14.209
government, were not determined to find

00:14:14.209 --> 00:14:16.959
a workable and lasting solution to the

00:14:16.959 --> 00:14:22.390
rebel (inaudible) in the country. This
led to the commencement of the dialogue,

00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:25.910
which resulted in the Lomi peace agreement

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:32.910
of 1999.
The initial stage of the dialogue was set

00:14:34.149 --> 00:14:37.070
when I was invited to Lo Mien Togo to

00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:43.730
sign a cease-fire agreement for the rebel
leader for the Sanko in March 1999. I

00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:49.300
did this, I missed a lot of misgivings

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:52.850
from the people of Sierra Leone. From the

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:59.490
bitter experience they had had regarding
(inaudible) attitude to the Abidjan peace

00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:03.360
accord, they, on the one hand, preferred

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:07.430
an all out war against the rebels, and an

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:14.430
attainment of peace by their defeat in
battle. I, on the other hand, was aware of

00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:21.670
the handicaps and limitations of the government

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:28.140
to proceed that way.
I was also aware of the pending restoration

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:29.899
of a democratically elected

00:15:29.899 --> 00:15:35.350
government in Nigeria, as a result of
which the continued stay of the Nigerian

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:39.339
contingent in Sierra Leone, which was

00:15:39.339 --> 00:15:42.560
by far the largest, could not be

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:49.560
guaranteed. Above all else, I could no
longer stomach the killing of innocent

00:15:49.589 --> 00:15:54.870
Sierra Leonins. Thus, I chose the path

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:58.709
of dialogue again. But this time, careful
to

00:15:58.709 --> 00:16:02.600
avoid the pitfalls and weaknesses in the

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:07.440
Abidjan peace accord. Along the lines

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:13.430
of the Abidjan peace agreement, the Lomi
peace accord included a blanket

00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:17.260
amnesty for competence and provided for

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.149
disarmament and demobilization and

00:16:20.149 --> 00:16:26.120
the reintegration of human rights and
truth and reconciliation commissions.

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:33.120
The parties also agreed to the deployment
of a neutral United Nations

00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:38.850
peacekeeping force. Most notably, it also

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:41.940
included a power sharing arrangement

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:47.990
among the elected government, the Ariyaf
and rebels and the AFRC. The Ariyaf

00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:52.720
leader for the Sanko was accorded a status

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.660
that was similar to that of the vice

00:16:55.660 --> 00:17:00.639
president and chairmanship of the important
commission for the management of

00:17:00.639 --> 00:17:05.240
strategic mineral resources and natural,

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:08.260
national reconstruction and

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:14.910
development. The MPC, the AFRC leader,
*Jonipul Koriman, was appointed

00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:18.540
chairman of the disarmament and reintegration

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:21.790
committee. With these

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:28.790
arrangements, expectations were high that
Sierra Leone had turned a corner and

00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:32.570
was on its way to lasting peace and stability.\

00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:39.570
On January 18, 2002, Sierra Leonins breathed
a sigh of joyous relief. For that

00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:46.460
memorable day marks the formal end of

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:50.309
the brutal conflict. We set ourselves

00:17:50.309 --> 00:17:56.440
specific goals in pursuit of sustainable
peace and national development. We

00:17:56.440 --> 00:18:01.280
shared the view that a peaceful and sustainable

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:04.230
environment, is a (inaudible) for

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:08.660
national development and by extension,
for achieving the millennium

00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:13.650
development goals. The starting point

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:18.730
was disarmament and reintegration of

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:25.730
competence by May 2004, a total of 72,490
competents were disarmed and

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:34.250
71,043 demobilized, including 6,845 child

00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:43.450
soldiers.
By the same period, 55,122 ex competents had

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:46.620
received support for their

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:53.620
integration into active committee life.
Also, most of the formerly, internally

00:18:54.770 --> 00:19:01.480
displaced persons and refugees where repatriated

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:05.620
and resettled. Indeed, the war

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:12.620
that's killed our people and ravaged our
country had become a thing of the past.

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:17.150
However, in order to ensure that the long

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:21.440
peace is consolidated, government

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:28.440
(inaudible) sustainable reforms in the
security sector. The underlying strategy is

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:31.799
to transform the security sector so that

00:19:31.799 --> 00:19:35.370
it is not only capable or responding

00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:42.370
adequately to threats, to the states,
and citizenry, but also to provide the enabling

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:46.809
environment to fight poverty and pursues

00:19:46.809 --> 00:19:53.809
the goals of national development.
This is particularly significant as what was

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:59.820
once a 17,000 person strong U.N.

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:06.450
peacekeeping force. (inaudible) is scheduled
to depart Sierra Leone within three

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:12.120
months that is by the end of this year.

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:17.640
As I pursued the peace process, I was

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:24.030
also cognizant of the fact that Sierra
Leonins were anxious. Not only to have

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:29.860
peace, but also to realize sooner than

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:34.700
the later, concrete dividends from this,

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:41.700
from the restoration of a democracy, of
a democratic government, which they had

00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:46.980
obtained after much toil and suffering.

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:52.140
We were constantly reminding ourselves that
lack of development breeds conflict

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:56.450
and insecurity. How then, do you keep

00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:59.690
the peace and maintain security under

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:05.340
those circumstances? While regarding peace
and security as being paramount,

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:10.429
we never abandoned our relief and development

00:21:10.429 --> 00:21:13.799
responsibilities. To this end,

00:21:13.799 --> 00:21:20.549
one of the most successful of our post
conflict initiatives was the establishment

00:21:20.549 --> 00:21:20.799
of

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:26.470
a national commitment for reconstruction,
resettlement, and rehabilitation. The

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:33.470
three R's. While it was evidently a response

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:35.720
to the humanitarian development

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:42.660
goals, in particular, for the rural areas,
which bore the brunt of rebel aggression,

00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:48.010
the NCRRR was in effect a bridge between

00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:50.250
the demand for immediate

00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:55.890
humanitarian relief and the equally important
need to prepare for a resumption of

00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:59.110
economic development activities that had

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:06.110
been ruthlessly disrupted by rebel war.
After all, people cannot remain or depend

00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:11.160
on humanitarian relief indefinitely.

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:17.970
Moving from relief to development, the
triple R commission was transformed into

00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:20.179
the National Commission for Social Action.

00:22:20.179 --> 00:22:25.120
NACSA. NACSA could be described

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:32.120
as the motive force for our post conflict
development. It is a showpiece in post

00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:37.020
conflict transition. While assuming responsibility

00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:40.350
for the previous reconstruction,

00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:46.160
resettlement, and rehabilitation programs,
NACSA also coordinated funding for

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:50.360
projects that promote economic growth

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:56.580
and sustainable development.
Working directly with local communities, it

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:59.820
supports projects and programs in

00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:06.450
such areas as water and sanitation, shelter,
public works, including agriculture,

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:13.330
fisheries, education, and micro financing.

00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:17.539
With almost 1,100 projects

00:23:17.539 --> 00:23:24.539
implemented, the ultimate objective of
NASCA is linked to our poverty reduction

00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:30.410
strategy. As stated above, even before

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:33.410
the war, poverty in Sierra Leone had

00:23:33.410 --> 00:23:40.410
become endemic and pervasive. By 1990,
statistics indicated that those, close to

00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:46.120
four-fifths of the population lived below

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:53.120
the poverty line of $1 a day.
In addition to income poverty, a large portion

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:58.080
of the population lacked access to

00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:03.760
basic social services, including health
care, education, potable water, and

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:07.620
sanitation. The war merely exacerbated

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:11.909
the death and severity of poverty,

00:24:11.909 --> 00:24:18.909
causing the living conditions of the majority
to further deteriorate. Following the

00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:23.620
election in 1996, my government began

00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:27.280
efforts to combat widespread poverty.

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:34.280
We begun by identifying five broad development
priorities. One, security and

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:37.620
world related issues such as disarmament,

00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:41.090
immobilization, reintegration, and

00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:48.090
resettlement, rehabilitation and reconstruction.
Two, education. Three, good

00:24:49.429 --> 00:24:52.980
governance and justice. Four, agriculture

00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:57.230
and food security. And five, health, with

00:24:57.230 --> 00:25:04.230
an emphasis on primary health care.
And in order to address these broad developmental

00:25:05.169 --> 00:25:09.190
priorities, we devised a

00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:15.980
poverty reduction strategy in the form
of an interim poverty reduction strategy

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:21.780
paper, which was completed in 2001. This

00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:25.400
strategy was designed to support the

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:32.400
transition from peace keeping to peace
building and from relief to an equitable

00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:36.340
and sustainable development. It calls

00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:39.840
for a two-phased implementation strategy.

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:46.840
A transition period, 2001-02 and a medium
term phase, 2003-2005. While the

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:53.780
transition period focused on immediate

00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:58.570
postwar reconstruction, resettlement and

00:25:58.570 --> 00:26:04.070
security challenges, the medium term phase
addressed long-term development

00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:06.289
strategy for property reduction within

00:26:06.289 --> 00:26:09.860
the context of the preparation of a full

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:16.860
poverty reduction paper, PRSP.
In addition, my government also provided for

00:26:17.539 --> 00:26:20.000
the implementation of a national

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:25.860
recovery strategy and (inaudible), which
was prepared and launched in October

00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:31.740
2002. A full cost on, the consolidation

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:35.510
of state authority and peace building, the

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:42.510
promotion of reconciliation and the encroachment
of human rights. Facilitating,

00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:49.450
resettlement and reintegration and rebuilding

00:26:49.450 --> 00:26:54.210
communities facilitating access to

00:26:54.210 --> 00:27:01.210
previously inaccessible areas and stimulating
economic recovery. The NRS

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:06.130
freeze represented the combined efforts

00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:08.919
of government and development

00:27:08.919 --> 00:27:14.280
partners and essentially served as a bridge
between emergency humanitarian

00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:16.230
assistance and longer term development

00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:23.230
challenges.
Both the IPRSP and the NRS were successfully

00:27:23.809 --> 00:27:27.929
implemented during 2001-2004

00:27:27.929 --> 00:27:34.929
with my government allocating significant
budget resources to form critical

00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:37.610
poverty reduction activities, particularly

00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:41.210
in the social sectors of health, education,

00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:48.210
water, and sanitation. This resulted in
sustained recovery of the economy during

00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:55.870
the period 2001-2004. Real GDP grew by

00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:05.140
5.4 percent in 2001, 6.3 in 2002, 6.5 in

00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:13.270
2003, and 6.4 in 2004. To consolidate
these gains, government adopted bold

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:23.640
economic and structural reforms geared

00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:27.549
towards sustaining the recovery and

00:28:27.549 --> 00:28:32.070
improving overall financial management
and service delivery.

00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:37.970
Other reform measures have included A: improving
the strengthing, policy

00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:44.590
making, budget planning, and execution.

00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:49.080
B: improving the capacity for accounting

00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:55.990
and reporting. C: reforming the public
procurement process. D: enhancing

00:28:55.990 --> 00:29:00.950
revenue collection and mechanisms through

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:04.070
the creation of a national revenue

00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:11.070
authority and E: public sector reform
generally. In order to achieve greater

00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:13.840
efficiency in the management of public

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:16.990
finances, and to ensure that public

00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:23.990
enterprises better serve the public of
Sierra Leone, we established a public

00:29:25.179 --> 00:29:28.450
enterprise privatization commission to

00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:31.320
oversee and monitor the oppression of

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:37.990
state enterprises and recommend their
privatization where appropriate.\

00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:44.049
Beyond that, we have been preoccupied with
institutional development as a

00:29:44.049 --> 00:29:47.679
means of not only expanding the institutional

00:29:47.679 --> 00:29:52.270
space, but also of modernizing our

00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:58.230
institutions so that they can provide
efficient service. Currently, Sierra Leone

00:29:58.230 --> 00:30:00.029
is

00:30:00.029 --> 00:30:07.029
aggressively pursuing a new strategic
direction to build towards the MDG targets.

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:14.360
It has formulated a 2005-2007 PRSB, which

00:30:15.650 --> 00:30:18.870
provides bold secturial policies and

00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:25.870
institutional reforms to achieve economic
growth, provide food security, job

00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:29.610
opportunities, basic social service, and

00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:36.610
efficient social security nets.
It proposes actions to address A: short term

00:30:37.919 --> 00:30:41.179
living conditions and B: long term

00:30:41.179 --> 00:30:48.179
causes of conflict and poverty. The poverty
reduction strategy paper constitutes

00:30:48.909 --> 00:30:52.529
Sierra Leone's first step towards achieving

00:30:52.529 --> 00:30:55.340
the Millennium development goals by

00:30:55.340 --> 00:31:02.340
2015. It is (inaudible) toward long-term
poverty reduction. It is multidimensional

00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:10.100
and achievable. As we all know, however,

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:14.059
neither the ongoing efforts of my

00:31:14.059 --> 00:31:20.279
government to achieve a meaningful improvement
in the welfare of our people,

00:31:20.279 --> 00:31:23.870
\f1 \uc0\u8232
\f0 nor our implementation of prudent fiscal

00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:26.980
and monetary problems can ever be
\f1 \uc0\u8232

00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:33.980
\f0 achieved if these efforts are not firmly
rooted in a solid framework of democratic

00:31:34.169 --> 00:31:36.320
practices and good governance.

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:43.320
That is why we are vigorously pursuing the
goals of good governance through

00:31:43.450 --> 00:31:46.980
several reform measures in improving the

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:50.360
performance and integrity of state

00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:56.890
institutions, fiscal public sector management,
and equality of public and political

00:31:56.890 --> 00:32:01.830
leadership. On my assumption of office,

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:04.440
my government immediately set up

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:11.440
improving the quality of governance and
later set up a governance steering

00:32:12.169 --> 00:32:14.279
committee under the chairmanship of a

00:32:14.279 --> 00:32:17.990
member of my cabinet. The committee

00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:23.679
has concentrated its efforts on rebuilding
democratic governance through

00:32:23.679 --> 00:32:28.149
constitutional and institutional reforms.

00:32:28.149 --> 00:32:30.950
Decentralization and local government

00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:36.710
reforms, public sector, and civil service
reforms, promotion of human rights,

00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:41.890
judicial and legal reforms, promotion

00:32:41.890 --> 00:32:48.890
of accountability and transparency.
The reduction of the incidents of corruption

00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:54.380
and abuse of power. In particular, my

00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:59.529
government views corruption as an impediment
to the promotion of good

00:32:59.529 --> 00:33:04.220
governance. Accordingly, combating endemic

00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:06.789
corruption is the cornerstone of our

00:33:06.789 --> 00:33:11.570
good governance program. We have, for
the first time in the history of Sierra

00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:15.510
Leone, appointed an ombudsman, whose role

00:33:15.510 --> 00:33:17.669
is to investigate complaints of

00:33:17.669 --> 00:33:24.669
abuse and capricious action on the part
of public officials. Also, for the first time

00:33:24.690 --> 00:33:29.500
in our history, and way ahead of other

00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:32.960
sub-Saharan African countries, we have

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:39.090
promulgated an anti-corruption act to
combat corruption and establish an anti-

00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:42.890
corruption commission with the mandate

00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:46.110
to investigate instances of alleged or

00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:52.020
suspected corruption and to take appropriate
action, including recommendations

00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:55.450
for prosecution.

00:33:55.450 --> 00:34:02.450
In a bid to stimulate economic development,
the rural areas and to extend

00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:12.210
democratic participation to the grassroots

00:34:12.329 --> 00:34:15.020
of the population, the government

00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:21.059
introduced legislation in early 2004 aimed
at promoting the centralization of

00:34:21.059 --> 00:34:24.539
government services and a reestablishment

00:34:24.539 --> 00:34:27.469
of elected local government

00:34:27.469 --> 00:34:33.369
councils. This initiative led to the enactment
of the Local Government Act in

00:34:33.369 --> 00:34:37.629
March 2004. Thereafter, local government

00:34:37.629 --> 00:34:40.729
elections were held nationwide in May

00:34:40.729 --> 00:34:47.729
\f0 of that year, in which municipal, town
and district councils were elected to replace

00:34:47.959 --> 00:34:51.849
the (inaudible) political appointed management

00:34:51.849 --> 00:34:54.450
committees that had been in

00:34:54.450 --> 00:34:59.009
These elections took government closer to

00:34:59.009 --> 00:35:02.829
the local community and considerably

00:35:02.829 --> 00:35:08.749
empowered them to take control of the
management of their own affairs. Another

00:35:08.749 --> 00:35:12.969
serious source of concern for my government

00:35:12.969 --> 00:35:16.459
is that of dealing with the

00:35:16.459 --> 00:35:21.920
dispensation of justice in Sierra Leone.
Accordingly, under the guidance of the

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:24.799
chief justice, the entire judicial and

00:35:24.799 --> 00:35:28.119
legal system is in the process of being

00:35:28.119 --> 00:35:34.670
completely overhauled. This activity,
which is aimed at developing an effecting

00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:37.999
and efficiently held and judicial system

00:35:37.999 --> 00:35:41.920
in Sierra Leone is part of the British

00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:48.140
funded Law Development Reform Project.
In line with our commitment, we now

00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:52.630
have a fully functioning law reform commission,

00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:55.069
whose mandate is to review all

00:35:55.069 --> 00:36:00.259
the laws of our country and to make recommendations
regarding the need for the

00:36:00.259 --> 00:36:03.299
(inaudible) amendment or repeal of laws.

00:36:03.299 --> 00:36:10.299
Further measures have been taken to provide
incentive and improve pay and

00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:17.029
other conditions of service for personnel

00:36:17.029 --> 00:36:19.890
in the legal service. The cumulative

00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:26.890
effect of all these, public sector reform
initiatives, is that Sierra Leone is gradually

00:36:28.119 --> 00:36:31.589
becoming the peaceful and wholesome society

00:36:31.589 --> 00:36:34.119
that it had been known to be at

00:36:34.119 --> 00:36:40.509
one time in the past. We are trying to
position Sierra Leone among the ranks of

00:36:40.509 --> 00:36:43.920
leading countries in Africa. Leaders in

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:47.170
addressing corruption. We will be leaders

00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:53.660
in human rights. We will be leaders in
electoral reform, we will be leaders in

00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:56.489
(inaudible) security. We must establish

00:36:56.489 --> 00:37:00.059
this reputation for leadership in order to

00:37:00.059 --> 00:37:07.059
begin to attract long term foreign investors.
We need foreign investment first in the development

00:37:08.559 --> 00:37:11.329
of infrastructure. Without

00:37:11.329 --> 00:37:16.319
adequate energy, telecommunications, transport,
and shipping services, we will

00:37:16.319 --> 00:37:20.229
not attract business investment. We are

00:37:20.229 --> 00:37:23.349
doing our best to provide a regulatory

00:37:23.349 --> 00:37:30.349
framework with particular, with predictable,
consistent, and simple procedures for

00:37:33.279 --> 00:37:37.400
doing business. Foreign enclaves mark

00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:40.339
our economic history, especially in the

00:37:40.339 --> 00:37:47.339
mining and commercial sectors. The business
of these sectors must be

00:37:48.079 --> 00:37:51.259
thoroughly integrated into our national

00:37:51.259 --> 00:37:54.809
economy. This is usually accomplished

00:37:54.809 --> 00:37:58.450
through the financial sector, including
the banks.

00:37:58.450 --> 00:38:04.229
We must enable national and foreign investors
to lend and borrow money in the

00:38:04.229 --> 00:38:07.890
local market. The financial links need

00:38:07.890 --> 00:38:11.049
to be developed between those who have

00:38:11.049 --> 00:38:16.150
money and those who want to invest money
in new businesses. Our banking

00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:22.670
system is starting to vigorously respond

00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:29.069
in the services to every district. Now, it

00:38:29.069 --> 00:38:36.069
must expand the kind of services it provides
and become a true hub for financial

00:38:41.170 --> 00:38:44.640
transactions between leaders, lenders,

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:49.519
and borrowers. The micro finance sector

00:38:49.519 --> 00:38:56.519
is emerging, is emerging, financial services
needs to expand to include medium

00:39:00.049 --> 00:39:03.650
sized loans, under commercial banks, and

00:39:03.650 --> 00:39:06.900
must finance agricultural and post

00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:11.599
harvest businesses to link agriculture
to industry.

00:39:11.599 --> 00:39:18.599
Private sector growth does not just refer
to foreign investment. We're witnessing

00:39:18.789 --> 00:39:21.890
a most encouraging response by farmers

00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:26.150
on the various initiatives of fields and

00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:32.339
schools and agricultural business units.
Last year, the minister of agriculture,

00:39:32.339 --> 00:39:35.549
forestry and food security provided seed

00:39:35.549 --> 00:39:40.209
rice to enable farmers to restore losses

00:39:40.209 --> 00:39:46.089
during the war and rebuild the acreage
necessary for food security. This year, the

00:39:46.089 --> 00:39:50.380
ministry is purchasing an additional 114,000

00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:54.549
bushels of rice, making these two

00:39:54.549 --> 00:40:01.549
years the largest efforts ever for government
support to expand, to the expansion

00:40:02.249 --> 00:40:04.640
of rice production.

00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:11.640
The agricultural business unit have pledged
to save 20 percent of their output

00:40:11.769 --> 00:40:16.930
and make a community contribution of 20

00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:22.380
percent to their local council. The

00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:28.729
successful harvest in 2005-2006 and the
commitment of these farmers to their

00:40:28.729 --> 00:40:34.160
pledges will launch a new era of agricultural

00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:37.539
business by small farmers. This is

00:40:37.539 --> 00:40:43.219
an encouraging development in the private
sector. We're hopeful that in 2006,

00:40:43.219 --> 00:40:47.660
this effort will culminate in Sierra Leone

00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:51.469
becoming once again a rice exporter.

00:40:51.469 --> 00:40:58.109
The task of achieving our own national
development goals on the MDGs, is

00:40:58.109 --> 00:41:02.410
daunting, especially for one of the least

00:41:02.410 --> 00:41:04.949
developed countries of the world, a

00:41:04.949 --> 00:41:09.869
country emerging from 11 years of armed
conflict.

00:41:09.869 --> 00:41:15.150
While acknowledging the need to strengthen
our capacity for good governance,

00:41:15.150 --> 00:41:19.380
mobilizing domestic financial institutions,

00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:23.259
etc. we have to make considerable

00:41:23.259 --> 00:41:30.259
efforts to create more jobs, to integrate
our youth into the economic and social

00:41:30.269 --> 00:41:34.799
mainstream of society. Here, I'm referring

00:41:34.799 --> 00:41:39.209
to the vast majority who never lifted an

00:41:39.209 --> 00:41:45.489
AK-47 rifle against anyone. We have learned
from experience that

00:41:45.489 --> 00:41:48.759
unemployment and disadvantaged youths

00:41:48.759 --> 00:41:52.079
provided a pool or recruits for the

00:41:52.079 --> 00:41:58.529
rebels. We have therefore created a new
ministry of youth and sports to enhance

00:41:58.529 --> 00:42:03.859
our ability, through well-designed projects.

00:42:03.859 --> 00:42:06.019
From meeting the needs of this

00:42:06.019 --> 00:42:13.019
important segment of the population.
In this regard, we have revised our national

00:42:14.130 --> 00:42:17.509
youth policy. It emphasizes youth

00:42:17.509 --> 00:42:22.769
empowerment and the mainstreaming of youth
activities and concerns as critical

00:42:22.769 --> 00:42:26.140
inputs in the development process. The

00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:29.630
major objective is the strengthening of

00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:36.630
partnership between the public and private
sectors to facilitate employment of

00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:44.910
youth. In coming up with this new policy,

00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:49.499
we realized that hard won peace as

00:42:49.499 --> 00:42:55.049
well as our efforts for sustainable development,
would be seriously jeopardized if

00:42:55.049 --> 00:42:58.959
we failed to address the youth problem

00:42:58.959 --> 00:43:03.630
speedily and effectively. We have to

00:43:03.630 --> 00:43:10.630
eliminate the rest of us sliding back
into conflict. The key lies in prevention.

00:43:13.569 --> 00:43:17.900
We agree with the Secretary General of the
United Nations that every step taken

00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:22.999
towards reducing poverty and achieving

00:43:22.999 --> 00:43:26.229
broad based economic growth is a step

00:43:26.229 --> 00:43:33.229
towards conflict prevention. We must create
a culture of prevention; one based

00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:39.369
on renewed commitment to address in a

00:43:39.369 --> 00:43:41.410
coordinated and comprehensive manner

00:43:41.410 --> 00:43:46.699
the problems of economic and social development.
I have no doubt whatsoever

00:43:46.699 --> 00:43:51.099
that this is the best means of insuring

00:43:51.099 --> 00:43:55.160
that Sierra Leone does not slide back into

00:43:55.160 --> 00:44:02.160
violent conflict. Ladies and gentlemen,
let me summarize what I believe, based

00:44:03.930 --> 00:44:07.099
on the Sierra Leone experience and lessons

00:44:07.099 --> 00:44:10.699
learned, are the key elements for

00:44:10.699 --> 00:44:16.410
meeting the challenges of post conflict
development.

00:44:16.410 --> 00:44:22.809
Least development countries emerging from
armed conflict face special problems

00:44:22.809 --> 00:44:26.150
that require special attention as well

00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:31.640
as specialized country specific solutions.

00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:38.509
Two, sustained economic and social development
is a key to the prevention of

00:44:38.509 --> 00:44:43.190
armed conflict. And perhaps the best means

00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:47.420
of preventing the reoccurrence of

00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:54.420
violence, violent armed conflict in developing
countries like Sierra Leone. Three,

00:44:55.569 --> 00:45:02.569
useless war related emergency relief and

00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:07.749
peacekeeping programs buttressed by

00:45:07.749 --> 00:45:14.739
comprehensive development programs, the
prospects for lasting peace will be

00:45:14.739 --> 00:45:19.009
dimmed.

00:45:19.009 --> 00:45:25.089
Four, development as an instrument of conflict
prevention and durable peace

00:45:25.089 --> 00:45:28.289
must also be considered in the context

00:45:28.289 --> 00:45:31.769
of regional peace and security. For

00:45:31.769 --> 00:45:38.049
instance, a strong and viable (inaudible)
union comprising New Guinea, Liberia,

00:45:38.049 --> 00:45:41.049
and Sierra Leone would help significantly

00:45:41.049 --> 00:45:43.699
and could alleviate most of the

00:45:43.699 --> 00:45:49.400
problems associated with the conflicts
in the sub-region. An equally strong and

00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:52.219
viable economy community of West African

00:45:52.219 --> 00:45:55.209
states. Focusing on its cooperation

00:45:55.209 --> 00:46:00.849
and integration would greatly enhance
the capacity of its member states to

00:46:00.849 --> 00:46:06.410
prevent armed conflict. Five, the concept

00:46:06.410 --> 00:46:13.410
of reintegration after armed conflict

00:46:13.809 --> 00:46:20.680
should be redefined.
It should be extended beyond the placement

00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:24.019
of ex competents in occupational

00:46:24.019 --> 00:46:29.489
and related activities to include the
integration of youth in the mainstream of

00:46:29.489 --> 00:46:34.619
society. And finally, small developing

00:46:34.619 --> 00:46:37.119
countries have very limited means to

00:46:37.119 --> 00:46:43.690
defend themselves against serious threats
to their security. Unless major powers

00:46:43.690 --> 00:46:46.509
and collective security arraignments are

00:46:46.509 --> 00:46:49.459
willing to provide the necessary

00:46:49.459 --> 00:46:55.680
assistance, when these states face serious
internal disturbances and/or external

00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:58.969
aggression, they will be doomed to perpetual

00:46:58.969 --> 00:47:03.719
turmoil. In the next two years, now

00:47:03.719 --> 00:47:10.719
that we have secured the peace, we will
constantly date the peace for future

00:47:10.749 --> 00:47:14.109
generations by developing Sierra Leone.

00:47:14.109 --> 00:47:21.109
We will be more strategic, we will be more
thorough. We will be more intolerant

00:47:21.309 --> 00:47:27.769
of corruption. We will protect the rights

00:47:27.769 --> 00:47:31.239
of women and children. We will secure

00:47:31.239 --> 00:47:38.239
and improve the education of our boy/girl
and our boy and girl children. We will

00:47:40.459 --> 00:47:43.799
continue to offer our youth the chance

00:47:43.799 --> 00:47:50.799
for literacy to recover the basic education

00:47:51.359 --> 00:47:57.769
they missed during the war. We will accelerate
the transformation of subsistence

00:47:57.769 --> 00:48:00.400
farming into surplus farming. We will

00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:05.039
build ability of our farmers to save and

00:48:05.039 --> 00:48:06.869
invest in their agricultural businesses.

00:48:06.869 --> 00:48:11.689
Above all, we will adhere to the tenants

00:48:11.689 --> 00:48:14.619
of participatory democratic governance

00:48:14.619 --> 00:48:20.339
and the rule of law. We have come a long
way, thanks to the invaluable

00:48:20.339 --> 00:48:23.089
contribution of every Sierra Leonin in

00:48:23.089 --> 00:48:26.160
various ways and to the support of the

00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:32.339
international community. Of course, we
acknowledge the fact that there is still a

00:48:32.339 --> 00:48:36.229
long way ahead of us. With commitments

00:48:36.229 --> 00:48:39.829
and hard work on the part of every

00:48:39.829 --> 00:48:45.749
Sierra Leonin and the support of friendly
countries and institutions, we will

00:48:45.749 --> 00:48:49.160
achieve the millennium development goals

00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:53.959
and targets. Finally, I hope you can

00:48:53.959 --> 00:49:00.959
appreciate that the path to peace and
development can be rugged. However,

00:49:01.729 --> 00:49:06.189
with determination, patience, and people's

00:49:06.189 --> 00:49:09.839
will, proper focus, and the grace of the

00:49:09.839 --> 00:49:14.049
Almighty, one is bound to succeed. I thank
you for your attention.

00:49:14.049 --> 00:49:14.299
}
