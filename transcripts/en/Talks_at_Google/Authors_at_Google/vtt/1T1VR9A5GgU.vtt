00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.700
&gt;&gt; DONNER: Welcome to Authors@Google. I'm
Marc Donner and I'm here to introduce Barbara

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.340
Probs Solomon. I've known Barbara many years
as a family friend and I've actually been

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:24.250
learning a little bit about her amazing career
and the time that we've been preparing for

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:33.330
this visit. As a teenager, shortly after the
end of World War II, Barbara did a rather

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.890
radical and sort of courageous thing and went
to Europe to look around and understand what

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:46.260
had happened there. At the time, when going
to Europe was not a luxurious trip to see

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:55.100
the sites and enjoy good food and live in
luxury. And there she got involved in the

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:02.420
struggle against the factious regime in Spain,
helping found a magazine called Peninsula

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.891
that was produced in Paris and smuggled across
the Pyrenees and to Spain and getting involved

00:01:08.891 --> 00:01:16.670
in rescuing political prisoners from Spanish
prisons and all kinds of amazing experiences,

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:26.100
coming back and becoming a world famous writer
here in the U.S. And we're here to celebrate

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.959
this new edition of her literary magazine
Reading Room. What's particularly interesting

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:40.749
about Reading Room from a sort of a geek perspective
is that it represents an entirely new approach

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:46.569
to publishing in a way that isn't obvious.
Because when you look at, it looks just like

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:51.789
a fairly conventional collection of pieces
of dead tree bound together. But what's remarkable

00:01:51.789 --> 00:02:00.179
is the production process doesn't involve
conventional publishing houses. The type setting

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:10.150
is done by the authors. And the book is printed
on demand by a service that they use. So no

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:14.819
longer is it the case that to get something
published, you have to commit a lot of capital,

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:20.810
print thousands of them and stick them in
a warehouse and then hope that they sell.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:28.999
So, there's lots of very interesting things
that I think she can teach us. So, Barbara?

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:40.840
&gt;&gt; SOLOMON: Well, first of all, I do want
to thank Marc Donner and Nicky Bausch [ph]

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:53.700
and all of you who come here to be with me
and hear this, for coming and for giving your

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:03.459
support. I'll probably use a mixture in my
usual offhand way of what I've written, and

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:15.769
also, my offhand comments. And then later
on, there are books there. And as a visual,

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:22.620
it's always been very important to us. I am--this,
I'll leave with Google, but these are all

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:34.220
different issues. And as you can see, we are
literary but with a big interest also in the

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:44.790
way things look, which, by the way, has helped
us. And I just want to speak a little bit

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:53.420
first about various things. Mainstream Publishing,
which after all my adventures in Europe as

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:59.159
a young--I came back to America belatedly
enrolled in the School of General Studies

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:08.420
and set out to be a writer. And then, so I
want to discuss that and I want to discuss

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:16.980
the modern technology involved. And to the
end, and I want a segway into a mutual discussion

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:24.200
of some thoughts for the future because we're
always just a little peg in the moment of

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.960
time going towards the next step. They'll
be your next step may not be mine. I mean

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:37.940
maybe, but still everything is always in transition.
Okay. For a moment, you know, the great best

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:44.700
sellers of the 90th century, of course, were
Harriet Beecher Stowe, Uncle Tom's Cabin and

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:51.060
Dickens, which were good books, but which
had some kind of a moral point. And there

00:04:51.060 --> 00:05:05.630
was a society out there ready to receive them.
And though--as Lincoln said, “Harriet Beecher

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:13.130
Stowe is a little lady who practically started
the Civil War." And sometimes, you have good

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:18.640
writing where writers are able to mesh their
talent, their ability to write with a social

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:24.460
temper of their times but not always. Just
take a quick look after a brief period of

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:33.280
recognition. Herman Melville was virtually
forgotten. Moby Dick was almost unknown until,

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:40.470
really he was reclaimed in the 1940s. F. Scott
Fitzgerald got off to a great start as the

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:51.090
bard of the Jazz Age. But then, his career
really ended abruptly in the crash, in the

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:57.680
Depression. He wasn't the writer for those
times. So it isn't just a question of ability

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:04.710
and talent. Then at a later point, of course,
we all know the Great Gatsby too. So it's

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:11.810
hard for us to imagine that when he died in
1940, he was a has-been sort of broke writer

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:17.410
trying to eke out a living in Hollywood and
nobody was thinking about the Great Gatsby.

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:27.190
So things come and go. Orwell sold 3,000 copies
of another classic when it was out here in

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:32.720
the early 50s; Homage to Catalonia, which
is now to it in probably every school. So,

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:41.980
it's a very up and down kind of road. Okay.
Marc gave that wonderful introduction and

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:48.730
we'll come back to him. But anyway, after
all of that, in my early--I'm about 22. I

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:54.000
don't know. But I came back to the United
States. I wanted to be a writer, although

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.660
my interest in Spain never stopped, went to
the School of General Studies to get belatedly

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:08.690
an undergraduate degree. And in one writing
workshop, I took one. We were explained the

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:15.830
dos and don'ts of how we writers would become
writers [INDISTINCT]. Now, one rule was that

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:21.610
you're only supposed to submit your story
magazine piece or novel to one magazine or

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:28.330
one publisher at a time. Now, I was stunned.
We knew that publisher sometimes kept managing

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:36.240
people for over a year. Sometimes magazines
didn't reply, and I, in my manner, said, "Well,

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:44.090
what kind of dumb rule is that? I mean, it's
sort of like signing a contract with someone

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:50.490
who didn't know you existed, whom you didn't
know existed and was under no obligation to

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:57.650
you. So right from the start, I shocked everybody
in the class and the teacher because I said

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:03.550
I was multiple submitting my work. I didn't
think it was unlikely to believe that anyone

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:09.990
or two people publish me for some bizarre
chance to publish one of my work. They would

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:17.310
probably want it more if they thought they
lost out to a competitor. Also, as I felt

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:26.520
that I was morally in the right, I was perfectly
willing to explain my reasoning in the unlikely

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:30.750
moment that a publisher would, two publishers
would want what I wrote. It never actually

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:38.599
happened. But I should--so I didn't have to
worry. But I always multiple submit it. Save

00:08:38.599 --> 00:08:45.260
myself a lot of time, watched my friends.
It was incredible. They would let these books

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:52.620
languish at a publisher, gave them some bizarre
sense of security, I think. But I do want

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:58.390
to make clear that none of us are born like
Venus straight out of a seashell. We're all

00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:05.190
influenced by our background. And I came from
the family of lawyers and law professors and

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:10.300
I had heard just enough legal eagle talk over
the dinner table. As an addition to being

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:18.130
a lawyer, by the way, my father was very successful
and innovative entrepreneur, to feel that

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:26.350
this publishing world was sitting on very
mushy terrain. And let me point out, my mother

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:33.790
also was an artist, so my later interest individuals.
So, you know, we all come from some place.

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:39.110
And usually, when we start our careers, we
deny it. Most Americans are not happy with

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:44.180
the way they're born. They think they're either
too poor, too middle-class, too rich, too

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:53.390
regular, too irregular. We never suited. But
anyway, we all come from somewhere. Among--and

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:58.190
I want to discuss this because I think it's
important even for Google to think about this.

00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:04.010
Among the other deadly sins, we, presumably
fledgling writers, were warned against, were

00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:11.240
vanity publishers. Although, the concept of
vanity publishing is not really in the minds

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:18.300
of your generation of entrepreneurial web
technology use, I think it's interesting to

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:25.330
look at its history a bit because I do think
it held back writers, that had an almost phobic

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:34.460
fear of vanity publishing and confusion about
what the term meant. And this interest me

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:40.480
because I've been interested as to why my
group, i.e., writers as distinguished from

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:48.750
artist and other people have been so up until
your generation, backward about pushing themselves

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:55.020
forward. Group theater productions have always
existed. Hollywood script writers, they had

00:10:55.020 --> 00:11:02.910
tough unions. I lives also a bit in the art
word and artists, certainly in the last 50

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:08.880
years, were not hesitant to get what they
wanted or to create the kinds of art galleries

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:17.110
that would represent their kind of work. And
interestingly enough, artists define themselves

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:24.870
and their success by the sale of their work
as we know, preparedly, for very high prices.

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:30.290
In those words, and those are such expressions
as you [INDISTINCT], which really basically

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:41.130
meant no sales. But in the literally world
where big sales were confused with best sellers

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:53.350
for a long time, it was very mushy. And although,
it's true what we were told, the vanity publishers

00:11:53.350 --> 00:12:01.730
to beware of them, they were fly-by-night
businesses that took the money of unsuspecting

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:10.380
writers, promising kind of weird results.
But what has to be straightened out is that

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:16.480
vanity publishing, which was sort of one of
many minor, very minor bad little things,

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:26.110
should not be confused with the almost inexplicable
passivity of writers. These are two different

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:34.760
things; at least, literary writers. So I think
we should dust it off and make clear the difference

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:43.100
between sleazy vanity publishing and the need
for writers as do all other artist to use

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:48.800
their own initiative. These are two different
things, because curiously enough, literary

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:58.670
writers--I'm sorry, have been--I thought they
were very passive. Now, I became lucky, my

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:04.290
editor, Ferneley, all my books was Cork Smith,
one of the great publishing editors. And it's

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:10.960
true; my books were published in first-rate
houses eventually. But nonetheless, I was

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:16.920
always sticking my nose in, whether it was
your--I was making sure that the photograph

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:24.210
I selected looked more the way I wanted to
project myself rather than the way I actually

00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:30.020
looked or by tramping to double days on Fifth
Ave. and other major bookstores with my book

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:35.020
under my arm, I would say, "The publicity
apartment says, 'To contact your local bookstore.'”

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:39.450
I think they were thinking of small town bookstore.
I would say, “Well, I'm in Manhattan, this

00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:44.350
is my local place. Would you put it in the
window?” They were sort of surprised, but

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:50.860
they usually did. In other words, it's a cliché.
Nothing ventured. Nothing gained. But this

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:57.750
is not the way literary writers thought. They
wanted to feel they were being taken care

00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:04.380
of. And as I once said in Spain a remark much
quoted: "In reality, there are no prestige

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:12.450
publishing houses. There are prestige writers
who lend publishing houses their prestige.

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:19.520
And let us be aware of two different things."
But by the 1980s, publishing which had started

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:26.850
out sort of a gentlemen's cottage industry,
with its goods and defects, it was essentially

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:32.899
over, the conglomerates had taken over. Publishers
needed to show Wall Street returns. Cork and

00:14:32.899 --> 00:14:38.690
I had talked it over, and interestingly, any
editor or writer who is not a total retard

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:43.990
had to understand at least the quarter of
century ago, that big time publishers now

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:53.430
had an infrastructure which only as a minor
sideline could include literary works. It

00:14:53.430 --> 00:15:02.810
was too unwieldy for this mammoth structure
that was sort of an MGM structure. And then

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:09.460
by 1986, when I covered the trial of the Nazi
work criminal Klaus Barbie Leon for American

00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:19.270
publication and for the Spanish--it was sort
of like Time Magazine, Cambio 16, I was then

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:25.899
on their staff, one of their correspondents.
I began to think about technology. By then,

00:15:25.899 --> 00:15:34.500
I had my first computer, but to Leon, I was
able to take a little tiny portable brother

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:40.740
which was like, “Oh, that's way to being
a computer.” It was like a mini kind of--I

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:50.110
mean, we look it now and we'd laugh. But it
did print and you could attach it to a portable

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:56.339
printer. A little mini thing that, again,
we would laugh at. And I now could get my

00:15:56.339 --> 00:16:03.210
pieces almost instantly from Leon, to Cambio
in Madrid or America overnight. As a journalist,

00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:12.690
I thought, "Wow! I mean, this little dinky
thing, it would--it could print like four

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:18.980
pages at a time." I mean, it had that kind
of capacity to hold maybe four, six pages

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:26.130
or eight. Enough for an article, you know.
And I began to see the world was beginning--because

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:34.200
I do a lot of journalism to change then in--I
think it was 2001. A friend of mine, literary

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:37.810
agent Eugene Winnick [ph] because he knew
I was always nattering on him about the need

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:43.390
for little magazines, etcetera, etcetera.
He said, "Come with me to this Expo in Chicago."

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:51.300
What I saw in Chicago was a demonstration
of Lightning's print on demand. A book was

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:57.140
put on one machine. It seems to be carried
through a conveyor belt to a series of machines

00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:04.140
that to me, looked like laundry machines.
But anyway, that would pop a book. Suddenly,

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:10.990
when I read all the brochures and the demonstrators
who took us around, and I began to sense what

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:16.689
they were doing. It flashed through my mind
that this might be a possible for me to achieve

00:17:16.689 --> 00:17:23.499
my long time dream of having my own literary
magazine. At this point, I have to confess

00:17:23.499 --> 00:17:30.789
something. My best subject, even though as
a writer, was always mathematics. So I heard

00:17:30.789 --> 00:17:37.320
my father's voice, the great entrepreneur,
he was successful, advising me, "Don't worry

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:42.960
about little luxuries, they can always be
stopped; just keep the basic net down, the

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:49.499
basic nut down.” I looked at these brochures.
There would be no warehouse cost, no middle

00:17:49.499 --> 00:17:55.830
man, the setup charges were minimal. If I
hire a good designer and art was important

00:17:55.830 --> 00:18:02.610
to me, I realize that the book and the print
type could look good. The books would go from

00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:08.679
Lightning to Ingram distributors directly
to online bookstores like Amazon and Barnes

00:18:08.679 --> 00:18:15.110
and Noble. You could also--if you got them
into independent bookstores, they could be

00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:26.159
there, and basically, you know, no warehouse,
no returns. And Ginny Winco [ph] but then

00:18:26.159 --> 00:18:32.210
at Lightning told me that Jason Eipstein of
Random House and I were the first people in

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:37.210
the literary publishing world to realize the
potential, not of other things but of print

00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:44.739
on demand. Jason was thinking books, but my
mind was going into another direction. A literary

00:18:44.739 --> 00:18:49.269
magazine that look like a magazine by that
time would have cost a fortune. And I could

00:18:49.269 --> 00:18:56.000
give some time, but I really couldn't afford
to lose money despite my so-called dazzling

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:05.190
career. My husband had died young. I had to
raise two daughters, one of them Marc knows,

00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:17.019
and that's my granddaughter, Catherine is
over there. I had a family to support and

00:19:17.019 --> 00:19:23.330
I managed but I didn't have at that point
in my life having, kind of raise my kids alone.

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:31.049
I didn't, as a writer, have the kind of money
that would have permitted me to lose money.

00:19:31.049 --> 00:19:41.279
I could give my time, but I couldn't lose
money. And anyway, I said to myself, “Distribution

00:19:41.279 --> 00:19:46.240
is already shaky. Stories are carried.”
Literary magazines were already going out

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:53.340
of business. So I thought what's to prevent
me from making a literary magazine in a book

00:19:53.340 --> 00:20:00.451
form, one that could go easily into online,
Barnes and Noble, et cetera, et cetera. If

00:20:00.451 --> 00:20:06.109
they were to be no returns and no this and
no that, and many of them goes, “There was

00:20:06.109 --> 00:20:14.350
basically no downside.” And I think at this
point, different parts of my personality meshed.

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:19.980
In my freshman year in high school, I was
the only girl who was chosen to work in the

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:29.330
print-liner type machine. My mother really
was a first-rate artist. And then, of course,

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:36.179
it was my informative experience in Europe
which Marc has already covered. But still,

00:20:36.179 --> 00:20:42.290
the fact that we were able to smuggle magazines,
cross borders, et cetera, et cetera, was on

00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:49.989
my mind when I made the Reading Room and I
also saw--knew how one little magazine made

00:20:49.989 --> 00:21:00.359
in cold, water rooms in Paris ended up being
part of Spanish history in a much, much, much

00:21:00.359 --> 00:21:15.720
later date. And so, Marc has discussed my
life in Europe, so I'm not really going to

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:21.470
go so much into that here now even though
you can question me more about it.

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:28.529
&gt;&gt; Hello. So, I have a question. I was wondering
if you could talk a little bit more about

00:21:28.529 --> 00:21:35.480
what it was like to go to Europe in 1948 and
really, was it for you the kind of mentality

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:39.190
that you seem to have in the beginning of
your literary career of nothing ventured,

00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:43.790
nothing gained. I mean, what was your real
inspiration to do that?

00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:48.989
&gt;&gt; SOLOMON: Oh, it's a good question. And
I think there are variety of explanations.

00:21:48.989 --> 00:21:57.460
One, I think as a child, I was interested
in Europe. My father had been--a private in

00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:03.609
the trenches, gassed in the first World War.
And I always thought, "Oh, it wasn't for certain

00:22:03.609 --> 00:22:09.730
bullet going the wrong way, I might not have
existed." Okay. So that was one reference.

00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:14.980
My mother was an artist. The truth of the
matter is some of my independence came from

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:22.440
the fact that she frequently abandoned the
family and she, in the '30s at times to World

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:29.240
War II, we take off for Europe, generally
for London. And then I had a nanny who was

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:35.299
from Germany. And as a Jewish child even though
the nanny came over here well before Hitler,

00:22:35.299 --> 00:22:45.600
it created also two things. So various things;
one, the fact that through--I was always wondering

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:52.950
what drew these people to Europe. Now my father,
he was drafted. Another--so, my--I had to

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:58.249
fix on that. And then, you know, I learned
to watch from the movies like every generation.

00:22:58.249 --> 00:23:04.009
When I was in the high school, the movies,
if you ever look, Turner classic movies, were

00:23:04.009 --> 00:23:12.159
all about World War II. So this was no exoteric
subject. In fact, I'm ashamed to say it looked

00:23:12.159 --> 00:23:19.409
rather glamorous, you know, so all these things.
And then I had I think a natural inclination

00:23:19.409 --> 00:23:26.320
too, even though I was curious because I was
a good student. But I don't think I was so

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:33.279
school-oriented, you know. I mean, when I
was little, I had read about Thomas Wolf.

00:23:33.279 --> 00:23:38.549
The first Thomas Wolf who was then a great
writer from the South convinced my parents,

00:23:38.549 --> 00:23:44.220
therefore, to--he was dead, to let me go to
a work camp, which is what they were called

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:50.399
then. They were cheaper. In North Carolina,
in the Appalachians, in the region where they

00:23:50.399 --> 00:24:00.039
shot, now, Cold Mountain a few years ago,
so I was sort of wanting to see what the [INDISTINCT]

00:24:00.039 --> 00:24:06.450
or it wasn't the [INDISTINCT], the equivalent
look like. And I was then about, I don't know,

00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:14.519
ten or eleven. So I think, combined with things
in the popular culture, which were the movies,

00:24:14.519 --> 00:24:22.690
if it wasn't some great history book, the
movies--the women in my family, my father's

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:33.279
early experiences as a private and my natural
of inclination to--there are many kinds of

00:24:33.279 --> 00:24:39.200
writers. I would never be a great player.
I'm never going to be a great poet. I don't

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:47.331
even think I was very good short-story writer.
I was good at writing what I saw, you know.

00:24:47.331 --> 00:24:55.859
So these things, does that answer your question
a bit?

00:24:55.859 --> 00:25:03.039
&gt;&gt; So we started to talk about a topic that
I'm very curious about. So I'll sort of put

00:25:03.039 --> 00:25:11.119
it out here for further comments. I studied
Spanish in high school, and I was sort of

00:25:11.119 --> 00:25:17.179
got advanced enough to be introduced to some
Spanish literature. The thing that I find

00:25:17.179 --> 00:25:23.200
remarkable about Spanish Literature versus
almost any other language with a major body

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:28.499
of literature is that it's largely unknown
in the English speaking world compared to

00:25:28.499 --> 00:25:36.519
Russian or French or Italian or German where
tremendous amounts of that literature is translated

00:25:36.519 --> 00:25:42.960
and sort of known, sort of by people who are
not in fact literati. Why is that?

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:50.369
&gt;&gt; SOLOMON: You're perfectly right. And what
we learned as students in school essentially

00:25:50.369 --> 00:25:59.799
was not European history. We learned English
history with a touch of French thrown in and

00:25:59.799 --> 00:26:06.979
it is curious because Spanish is one of the
great literatures. But aside from that, it

00:26:06.979 --> 00:26:18.490
was also until we took Cuba back from them
the Philippines which--I mean, we also took

00:26:18.490 --> 00:26:24.940
Spanish characters. I'm sure there's a lot
of that mixed into it. But it was the Holy

00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:32.749
Roman Empire. It had more command over the
world than England did. And so, I know that

00:26:32.749 --> 00:26:38.019
when I got back from Europe and went to college,
I was always translating in my mind. I thought

00:26:38.019 --> 00:26:43.330
what they're teaching me is English history.
There's no Don Quixote. There's no--you would

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:49.009
never know, even to this day. You would not
know, because I was listening to the talk

00:26:49.009 --> 00:26:55.519
about on the fourth of July, the American
Revolution. We know the French helped out.

00:26:55.519 --> 00:27:02.419
You would never know that more money came
from the Spanish and they helped out. I mean,

00:27:02.419 --> 00:27:08.419
for the wrong reasons, they had--first of
all, they had pacts with the French and they

00:27:08.419 --> 00:27:15.799
were zany British as the French were. So they
saw it as a great investment. Now, would any--I'm

00:27:15.799 --> 00:27:21.380
listening to these programs and I think, “Hey,
even though I reviewed books on this for the

00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:27.730
Wall Street Journal about a year ago. What
do we know about or--and apparently, and this

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:35.080
is according to Hugh Thomas, who's a British,
not a Spaniard. Apparently, America still--and

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:43.599
Benjamin Franklin still always paid a pot
of money. I mean, so your question is well

00:27:43.599 --> 00:27:50.700
taken, and then I think it was basically--I
don't know. We had England and France on our

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:57.059
minds basically. And then we were always at
war with something Spanish; later on, not

00:27:57.059 --> 00:28:08.669
then. But--and in a way, it is curious because
this new issue of The Reading Room which you

00:28:08.669 --> 00:28:17.450
can see over there which is--has really the--I
said the iconic figure. It's really the great

00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:23.989
Spanish geniuses of contemporary Spanish literature
over the last 50 years. Well, it's actually

00:28:23.989 --> 00:28:32.440
the first time they have been collected in
one volume. And we know we get a lot of support

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:44.179
for this issue. But the thing is again, it's
not normal that these world famous writers

00:28:44.179 --> 00:28:50.690
are so unknown in this country. And I'll go
further and say, “One reason that we were

00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:57.340
so startled by the so-called Spanish miracle
recovery after Franco is that we didn't have

00:28:57.340 --> 00:29:07.269
a clue as to the huge investments and modernization
that Spain already had done, you know, which

00:29:07.269 --> 00:29:16.649
is we didn't know.
&gt;&gt; I have two questions. One, with the--we

00:29:16.649 --> 00:29:22.419
follow the new technology and internet. It's
going to become easier and easier to first

00:29:22.419 --> 00:29:26.890
present your work. If you are a writer, all
you need to do is put it on the website. But

00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:30.799
also as you mentioned, it's going to become
easier and easier to actually create your

00:29:30.799 --> 00:29:33.869
own magazine because you don't need to select
the couple of...

00:29:33.869 --> 00:29:35.999
&gt;&gt; SOLOMON: I don't get the last sentence.
What?

00:29:35.999 --> 00:29:40.129
&gt;&gt; I'm saying, because it's also going to
become easier to create your own magazine,

00:29:40.129 --> 00:29:43.139
dictionary magazine when you put it online.
&gt;&gt; SOLOMON: Yes.

00:29:43.139 --> 00:29:50.529
&gt;&gt; You would also, I would also expect that
there's going to appear more and more of--say

00:29:50.529 --> 00:29:56.909
junky magazine. So how do you view the pros
of selection of quality, content in the future?

00:29:56.909 --> 00:30:02.759
&gt;&gt; SOLOMON: Okay. It depends from which point
of view do you mean from the reader, the buyer,

00:30:02.759 --> 00:30:07.460
or the editor, which?
&gt;&gt; Well, I mean, if I'm a reader and suppose

00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:12.029
there is a lot of magazines out there, how
would I actually know which one?

00:30:12.029 --> 00:30:22.659
&gt;&gt; SOLOMON: It's good question and it's sort
of a dilemma. And it's not totally easy to

00:30:22.659 --> 00:30:30.159
answer. I would still say--because one of
the ways that people use to select what they

00:30:30.159 --> 00:30:36.340
wanted to read or what they felt was good
was through book reviewing. They could read

00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:42.450
the reviews. Now, that is so closing down.
In fact, I was surprise to hear [INDISTINCT]

00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:49.369
house of the Times Book Review to refer to
what he does in the Book Review and he said,

00:30:49.369 --> 00:30:58.619
“And we include some literary fiction.”
They didn't use to be such a word because

00:30:58.619 --> 00:31:04.840
The Times didn’t do just a little bit. And
if they did fiction, it was literary fiction.

00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:21.830
So I think that--that kind of information
as to what you read, it goes to many channels.

00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:33.450
It goes through universities. In other words,
it depends what your world is. Even with all

00:31:33.450 --> 00:31:41.869
the technology, you're going to have to--the
down side, is that--which I think is really

00:31:41.869 --> 00:31:48.070
what you're asking is that there's a lot of
junk on there. And how do you avoid the junk

00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:56.070
and get to the good? And I think then you
get to know like there's a certain webpage

00:31:56.070 --> 00:32:03.169
is [INDISTINCT] is one run by Steve Wasserman.
That has--have good reviewing sections that

00:32:03.169 --> 00:32:09.269
you can believe in. And I think through--actually,
the way it was always done through your friends,

00:32:09.269 --> 00:32:19.950
through school, through asking around through
some better--whenever the good literary review

00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:35.499
things are. You get to know the--for example,
there's a good Jewish reviewing section. There

00:32:35.499 --> 00:32:42.789
are things for other languages. But I think
that it's something that you and your generation

00:32:42.789 --> 00:32:48.720
kind of have to figure out. I mean, in my
generation we said, “Hey, why don't you

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:56.379
read the New Republic?" or "Why don't read
you this?" or "Have you heard of this book?”

00:32:56.379 --> 00:33:05.609
But I think there's a downside which is where
your problem will be is somehow working your

00:33:05.609 --> 00:33:15.879
way and learning what not to go near, the
slush pile of the web. And I think there are

00:33:15.879 --> 00:33:26.229
even webpages that address that issue, but
you have to be a bit of a detective.

00:33:26.229 --> 00:33:33.320
&gt;&gt; And the second question is how do you feel
about the new electronic book reading devices

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:39.220
now like Amazon's Kindle or Sony Reader, do
you feel that they will replace the written--the

00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:43.179
printed content?
&gt;&gt; SOLOMON: You know, I think that they are

00:33:43.179 --> 00:33:53.899
good. I think it's--rather than seeing a particular
piece of technology as the answer, just the

00:33:53.899 --> 00:34:01.969
way I see the Reading Room as--I see it as
one chink, one stage. And I mean, we have

00:34:01.969 --> 00:34:09.340
digit or books that are digitalized. Hopefully,
at one point, they'll go on Kindle or some

00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:17.839
other book form, you know, they are digitalized.
But I think that just like the computer didn't

00:34:17.839 --> 00:34:26.909
stay--in the mini-computer I had in Leon in
1986. I think it's bad to think of anything

00:34:26.909 --> 00:34:37.020
as fixed. Nothing is fixed; everything is
in transition. So it may be that--and by the

00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:44.539
way, you should be--when uses more than one
technique at a time like the Reading Room

00:34:44.539 --> 00:34:53.919
has the old fashion ideals of Little Magazines
which, by the by, something like 80 or 90%

00:34:53.919 --> 00:35:00.520
of America's greatest writings including Ulysses
and [INDISTINCT] came out of Little Magazines

00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:07.789
not out of that big ball publishing. It's
import--80 or 90% of what we think are today's

00:35:07.789 --> 00:35:18.690
classic or great writers, which is astonishing.
So these were little mom and pop things. Many

00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:28.119
of them run by women. So, we use a combination
of old fashion techniques. In other words,

00:35:28.119 --> 00:35:34.420
when I want outreach--oh, I mean, one of the
assets, I would say, that I have is being

00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:41.079
a kind of well-known writer. I have friends
and we can have events and so forth and so

00:35:41.079 --> 00:35:49.619
on. So that's an old fashion technique. But
it's never going to stop with either print

00:35:49.619 --> 00:35:58.599
on demand or Kindle books or whatever they
are. At this stage it's--you're better off

00:35:58.599 --> 00:36:05.029
in taking the best of the past and always
thinking, “Hey, this isn't forever. This

00:36:05.029 --> 00:36:14.049
is one step along the way.”
&gt;&gt; I was wondering what it was like to be

00:36:14.049 --> 00:36:23.060
a woman in Spain in the later part of the
1940s, you know, Spain is in some ways for

00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:27.510
good and bad known for it's sort of machismo
culture, and I was wondering if you faced

00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:34.089
more opposition than you anticipated as an
independent woman there or if you expected

00:36:34.089 --> 00:36:36.839
to receive more than you did?
&gt;&gt; SOLOMON: Okay. The short answer is that

00:36:36.839 --> 00:36:44.010
women do well in wars and resistance movements
when there's nobody else around because they're

00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:51.060
needed. And I was living in Paris and these
Spaniards were living in Paris, which was

00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:59.270
a better place to be as a woman than the United
Sates at that time. Now, this was a sort of

00:36:59.270 --> 00:37:08.029
extraordinary little group. I would have to
say--but again, the circumstances were different.

00:37:08.029 --> 00:37:15.210
Everybody was sort of down and out and struggling.
And though, my remark to you maybe flipped

00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:24.329
about women do well when needed. Nobody was
looking at Spain even later on. And I used

00:37:24.329 --> 00:37:29.660
to tell my students, I said, "It's good to
know some stuff later on." When I was a writer

00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:39.370
back in New York, the fact that I actually
new something, like the resistance movements

00:37:39.370 --> 00:37:48.000
in Europe, help me get into American magazines
that would very machismo-like. The New Republic,

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:54.789
the New York Review of Books, which by the
way, in many ways I found far more prejudice

00:37:54.789 --> 00:38:02.049
against Europe women than the myths of Europe.
In other words, if you--even today with major

00:38:02.049 --> 00:38:08.010
American political women as figures, if you
look at the New York review, when you look

00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:15.839
at the New Republic even the New Yorker, you
will usually find three women to 25 men. So,

00:38:15.839 --> 00:38:25.589
I don't care what you call it. It's nuts.
&gt;&gt; You spoke a little bit about the conception

00:38:25.589 --> 00:38:30.849
of the Reading Room. Can you talk a little
bit more about how you choose a topic, for

00:38:30.849 --> 00:38:34.289
instance, or how you choose writers and the
pieces that go into it?

00:38:34.289 --> 00:38:45.990
&gt;&gt; SOLOMON: Yes. That is--first of all, it's--this
was a question asked to me by friends when

00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:50.069
I made--they said, “You'll never find writers
and agents.” They didn't seem to even in

00:38:50.069 --> 00:38:57.460
2002. I understand that was not going to be
our problem. They were out of it. The publishing

00:38:57.460 --> 00:39:05.940
world, excuse me, was totally out of sync
with anything that was going on. How do you

00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:11.609
find writers? Well, first of all, a lot just
came to us. Remember...

00:39:11.609 --> 00:39:14.590
&gt;&gt; How do you pick pieces...?
&gt;&gt; SOLOMON: Okay. I'm going to tell you. And

00:39:14.590 --> 00:39:22.690
then I was professor. I had been at the city,
I had been at Sarah Lawrence. Some of our

00:39:22.690 --> 00:39:33.950
interns and some of the writing pieces came
directly from there. We were all--it's not

00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:42.319
just us, any magazine. It's more deluged than
not, you know. And our things were always

00:39:42.319 --> 00:39:50.099
a mixture of super unknown mixed with Nobel
Prize winners. We had a big issue on Kenya.

00:39:50.099 --> 00:40:02.529
This is long before Obama. And I'd say we
were idiosyncratic. And--but from the writer's

00:40:02.529 --> 00:40:17.519
point of view--it sounds odd, but you're asking--are
you asking this from the writer's point of

00:40:17.519 --> 00:40:24.069
view? Or the editors, which...
&gt;&gt; I guess more--I think it's more from the

00:40:24.069 --> 00:40:27.670
editor's point of view. I mean, as a writer...
&gt;&gt; SOLOMON: Yes.

00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:32.109
&gt;&gt; You know, if I would get something to you,
you would look at it and--on one criteria

00:40:32.109 --> 00:40:35.770
or how do you decide then how to put together
one of these specifics?

00:40:35.770 --> 00:40:41.569
&gt;&gt; SOLOMON: Okay. Well, usually what happens
is that in the beginning of each issue, we

00:40:41.569 --> 00:40:48.431
usually have some things and then depending
on what writers are coming our way that we

00:40:48.431 --> 00:40:55.609
think are good. Interestingly enough, even
though it looks--the finish product looks

00:40:55.609 --> 00:41:03.289
as if we have carefully designated categories
and one leads into another, nothing like that

00:41:03.289 --> 00:41:11.019
ever takes place. The categories come after
we have enough material that we think works

00:41:11.019 --> 00:41:21.660
together and I would say there's this--it
comes in through my editors, it comes in through

00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:32.520
me, it comes in through the trans of--it's
a mixture. But it is totally idiosyncratic

00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:41.840
so that suddenly, you have all these things.
Now, this issue we knew we were going to make

00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:46.890
Spanish, although it's blended with American
things. And suddenly I say, “Well, we don't

00:41:46.890 --> 00:41:57.560
have something humorous or there's not enough
art, or we need some more essays and there's

00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:04.549
enough poetry.” So it's kind of--I would
say in the long run, every book--and this

00:42:04.549 --> 00:42:10.970
could be for mainstream or this sort of thing,
really represents the passions of the editor

00:42:10.970 --> 00:42:18.549
and the taste. There's no right or wrong.
Magazines usually take on the identity and

00:42:18.549 --> 00:42:23.210
the taste of the people who are running them
and making it, which is logical.

00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:26.249
&gt;&gt; Well, we thank you so much for coming today.
&gt;&gt; SOLOMON: And thank you.

00:42:26.249 --> 00:42:30.880
&gt;&gt; And we thank all of you for coming today
too. If you'd like to have your book signed,

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:35.569
please do that. And thank you so much.
&gt;&gt; SOLOMON: My pleasure. Goodbye.
