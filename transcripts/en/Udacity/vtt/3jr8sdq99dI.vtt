00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's see if we can find a positive solution.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The second insight is that any solution can be increased by 5^6,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
which is 15,625.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Suppose N is a solution. We take 1 away, and we do this.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Then N + 15,625 will move to this number by subtracting 1,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
which will move to this number over here.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Interestingly enough, this is the same as this expression over here,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
factoring out the 5^6.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Now, what's interesting is this expression over here 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
is the same as this expression over here.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
So this works 6 times in a row if N is a valid solution.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
This expression over here is now 5 times divisible by 5,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
so we can plug this into the next iteration,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and what we end up with is something like this--

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
5^4 times 16.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
We're going to go to 5^3 times 64 all the way while it's still divisible by 5.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
It's still an integer. We can do this 6 times.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Therefore, 5^6 minus 4 is a solution.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Now I want you to write the world's shortest Python program to solve this problem

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
that spits out a valid solution based on this insight.
