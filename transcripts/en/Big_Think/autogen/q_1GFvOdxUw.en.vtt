can and the reason they charge more is
 

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:42.980
can and the reason they charge more is
because they get the money I mean it's

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:07.290
very small number of people who are
 

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:09.170
very small number of people who are
occurring most of those costs so one

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:09.180
occurring most of those costs so one
 

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:10.430
occurring most of those costs so one
percent of the population is about

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:10.440
percent of the population is about
 

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:12.500
percent of the population is about
thirty-five percent of the cost five

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:12.510
thirty-five percent of the cost five
 

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:14.270
thirty-five percent of the cost five
percent population about fifty percent

ten percent of the populations eighty
 

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.530
ten percent of the populations eighty
percent of the cost so if we went to

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:18.540
percent of the cost so if we went to
 

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:20.570
percent of the cost so if we went to
that ten percent of the population or

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:20.580
that ten percent of the population or
 

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:22.760
that ten percent of the population or
eighty percent of the cost and did a

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:22.770
eighty percent of the cost and did a
 

00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:24.710
eighty percent of the cost and did a
much better job of delivering care to

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:24.720
much better job of delivering care to
 

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.950
much better job of delivering care to
those people we could make a huge

00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:27.960
those people we could make a huge
 

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.270
those people we could make a huge
difference in the cost of care in

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:29.280
difference in the cost of care in
 

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:31.400
difference in the cost of care in
America and we could also make care

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:31.410
America and we could also make care
 

00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:33.530
America and we could also make care
better and that's the opportunity the

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:33.540
better and that's the opportunity the
 

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:35.680
better and that's the opportunity the
real opportunity is to make care better

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:35.690
real opportunity is to make care better
 

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:38.330
real opportunity is to make care better
by focusing on the people who really

by focusing on the people who really
 

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:42.290
by focusing on the people who really
need team care in delivering that care

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:42.300
need team care in delivering that care
 

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:45.530
need team care in delivering that care
and doing in a systematic way and the

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:45.540
and doing in a systematic way and the
 

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:47.990
and doing in a systematic way and the
best way of doing that is to have

00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:48.000
best way of doing that is to have
 

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.570
best way of doing that is to have
computer support for your care the best

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:50.580

way of doing that is to have all of the
 

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:54.500
way of doing that is to have all of the

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:54.510
information about each of the patients
 

00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:57.230

frustrating for the caregiver and it's
 

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.760
frustrating for the caregiver and it's

you need you've got to get that
 

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.760
you need you've got to get that
information into a computer and then you

information into a computer and then you
 

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:03.830
information into a computer and then you
need to have the doctor able to access

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:03.840
need to have the doctor able to access
 

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.200

they know what the next treatments need
to be and also so there could be care

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:11.700
to be and also so there could be care

00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:17.300
plans about each patient right now the
care plans are also very siloed and

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:17.310
care plans are also very siloed and
 

00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:19.430
care plans are also very siloed and
isolated so the doctor who is treating a

with the internist who does not link up
 

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:27.350
with the internist who does not link up
with the cardiologist and so you end up

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:27.360
with the cardiologist and so you end up
 

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.030

00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:52.160
what was the thinking and and the
rationale behind it well Kaiser as you

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:52.170
rationale behind it well Kaiser as you
 

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:53.720
rationale behind it well Kaiser as you
said earlier is a vertically integrated

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:53.730
said earlier is a vertically integrated
 

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:56.990
said earlier is a vertically integrated
system so we have the largest private

00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:57.000
system so we have the largest private
 

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:57.630
system so we have the largest private

00:15:57.630 --> 00:15:57.640
medical group
 

00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:01.380
medical group
in the world we have a hospital system

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:01.390
in the world we have a hospital system
 

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:04.140
in the world we have a hospital system
that we own and operate we own our own

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:04.150
that we own and operate we own our own
 

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:07.950
that we own and operate we own our own
labs and clinics and have all the pieces

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:07.960
labs and clinics and have all the pieces
 

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:09.810
labs and clinics and have all the pieces
of the care delivery system what we

00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:09.820
of the care delivery system what we
 

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:12.570
of the care delivery system what we
didn't have was an integrated database

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:12.580
didn't have was an integrated database
 

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:15.960
didn't have was an integrated database
about all those patients so we also even

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:15.970
about all those patients so we also even
 

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:18.620
about all those patients so we also even
though we had integrated care delivery

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:18.630
though we had integrated care delivery
 

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:21.810
though we had integrated care delivery
and information silos didn't have the

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:21.820
and information silos didn't have the
 

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:23.700

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:23.710
connectivity didn't have real-time data
 

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:25.950
connectivity didn't have real-time data
and we said if we're going to take this

00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:25.960
and we said if we're going to take this
 

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:27.930
and we said if we're going to take this
very nice model which we're very fond of

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:27.940
very nice model which we're very fond of
 

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:30.390
very nice model which we're very fond of
of vertically integrated care system if

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:30.400
of vertically integrated care system if
 

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:31.920
of vertically integrated care system if
we're going to optimize this model we're

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:31.930
we're going to optimize this model we're
 

00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:35.160
we're going to optimize this model we're
really going to perfect it we need

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:35.170
really going to perfect it we need
 

00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:37.470
really going to perfect it we need
information we have to have the data we

have to have all of the data pieces

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:41.890
have to have all of the data pieces
 

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:44.280
have to have all of the data pieces
available in real time to the doctor in

the exam room so it went down that path
 

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:48.330
the exam room so it went down that path
and we said we're going to computerize

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:48.340
and we said we're going to computerize
 

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:51.060
and we said we're going to computerize
the entire database and we did and so

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:51.070
the entire database and we did and so
 

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:53.610
the entire database and we did and so
right now doctors in Kaiser Permanente

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:53.620

that cuts those deaths in half we really

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:53.730
that cuts those deaths in half we really
 

00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:55.279
that cuts those deaths in half we really
need that in this country and we need to

00:23:55.279 --> 00:23:55.289
need that in this country and we need to
 

00:23:55.289 --> 00:23:56.570
need that in this country and we need to
get all the hospitals on board with that

00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:56.580
get all the hospitals on board with that
 

00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:58.430
get all the hospitals on board with that
agenda we need to get all of the major

00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:58.440
agenda we need to get all of the major
 

00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:00.590
agenda we need to get all of the major
buyers on board with that agenda because

00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:00.600
buyers on board with that agenda because
 

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:02.720
buyers on board with that agenda because
we need to make Hospital safer in this

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:02.730
we need to make Hospital safer in this
 

00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:05.720
we need to make Hospital safer in this
country and have better outcomes and in

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:05.730
country and have better outcomes and in
 

00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:08.960
country and have better outcomes and in
the process will end up reducing costs

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:08.970
the process will end up reducing costs
 

00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:11.090

there was a study that came out about

00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:11.100
there was a study that came out about
 

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:14.509
there was a study that came out about
two weeks ago it was a fascinating study

00:24:14.509 --> 00:24:14.519
two weeks ago it was a fascinating study
 

00:24:14.519 --> 00:24:17.629
two weeks ago it was a fascinating study
because they analyzed each of several

00:24:17.629 --> 00:24:17.639
because they analyzed each of several
 

00:24:17.639 --> 00:24:19.610
because they analyzed each of several
thousand hospitals and they analyzed the

00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:19.620
thousand hospitals and they analyzed the
 

00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:21.710
thousand hospitals and they analyzed the
hospital's based on their process and

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:21.720
hospital's based on their process and
 

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:24.320
hospital's based on their process and
they rated them from one star which was

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:24.330
they rated them from one star which was
 

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:27.139
they rated them from one star which was
very weak internal process to five stars

00:24:27.139 --> 00:24:27.149
very weak internal process to five stars
 

00:24:27.149 --> 00:24:29.240
very weak internal process to five stars
which was very solid internal process to

and then doing follow-up care so they

00:24:34.129 --> 00:24:34.139
and then doing follow-up care so they
 

00:24:34.139 --> 00:24:35.749
and then doing follow-up care so they
rated them based on process then they

00:24:35.749 --> 00:24:35.759
rated them based on process then they
 

00:24:35.759 --> 00:24:37.850
rated them based on process then they
went back and looked at what's the

00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:37.860
went back and looked at what's the
 

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:40.669
went back and looked at what's the
difference in survival rate from once

00:24:40.669 --> 00:24:40.679

going to be doing things systematically
 

00:27:13.169 --> 00:27:17.060
going to be doing things systematically
and if you're at a hospital ask them how

00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:17.070
and if you're at a hospital ask them how
 

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:19.519
and if you're at a hospital ask them how
many code blue rehearsals they've done

00:27:19.519 --> 00:27:19.529
many code blue rehearsals they've done
 

00:27:19.529 --> 00:27:23.629
many code blue rehearsals they've done
and did they do simulations we have

00:27:23.629 --> 00:27:23.639
and did they do simulations we have
 

00:27:23.639 --> 00:27:27.580
and did they do simulations we have
actually at Kaiser Permanente we have

00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:27.590
actually at Kaiser Permanente we have
 

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:31.070
actually at Kaiser Permanente we have
mannequins mannequins that have heart

00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:31.080
mannequins mannequins that have heart
 

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:35.090
mannequins mannequins that have heart
attacks have strokes give birth whatever

00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:35.100
attacks have strokes give birth whatever
 

00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:36.470
attacks have strokes give birth whatever
and we actually drill with the

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:36.480
and we actually drill with the
 

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:39.799
and we actually drill with the
mannequins and so our people can instead

00:27:39.799 --> 00:27:39.809
mannequins and so our people can instead
 

00:27:39.809 --> 00:27:41.860
mannequins and so our people can instead
of drilling on live patients they can

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:41.870
of drilling on live patients they can
 

00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:46.279

00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:43.730
very basic process improvement hospitals
could make and if they made them they

lives but the most important thing
 

00:30:56.970 --> 00:30:59.690
lives but the most important thing
wasn't that just that he got hospitals

00:30:59.690 --> 00:30:59.700
wasn't that just that he got hospitals
 

00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:01.430

two thousand lives the important thing

00:31:03.170 --> 00:31:03.180
two thousand lives the important thing
 

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:05.660
two thousand lives the important thing
was the same learning they put in place

00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:05.670
was the same learning they put in place
 

00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:07.910
was the same learning they put in place
to save the hundred thousand lives is

00:31:07.910 --> 00:31:07.920
to save the hundred thousand lives is
 

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:11.290
to save the hundred thousand lives is
now in place and can be used for other

00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:11.300
now in place and can be used for other
 

00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:14.990
now in place and can be used for other
hospital improvement processes so it

00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:15.000
hospital improvement processes so it
 

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.610
hospital improvement processes so it
created a template it created at the

electronic medical record they started
 

00:34:42.359 --> 00:34:45.260
electronic medical record they started
about the same time we did they spend at

00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:45.270
about the same time we did they spend at
 

00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:48.320
about the same time we did they spend at
least twice as much money and they still

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:48.330
least twice as much money and they still
 

00:34:48.330 --> 00:34:52.099

don't have a system that's functioning

00:34:52.099 --> 00:34:52.109
don't have a system that's functioning
 

00:34:52.109 --> 00:34:54.320
don't have a system that's functioning
at the level that you would like it to

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:54.330
at the level that you would like it to
 

00:34:54.330 --> 00:34:56.300
at the level that you would like it to
function and one of the reasons is they

00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:56.310
function and one of the reasons is they
 

00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:57.770
function and one of the reasons is they
skipped that front end they skipped the

00:34:57.770 --> 00:34:57.780
skipped that front end they skipped the
 

00:34:57.780 --> 00:34:59.300
skipped that front end they skipped the
clever to built they skipped a doctor

00:34:59.300 --> 00:34:59.310
clever to built they skipped a doctor
 

00:34:59.310 --> 00:35:01.880
clever to built they skipped a doctor
buy-in and so they didn't have a bunch

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:01.890
buy-in and so they didn't have a bunch
 

00:35:01.890 --> 00:35:03.500
buy-in and so they didn't have a bunch
of very smart doctor say here's what we

00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:03.510
of very smart doctor say here's what we
 

00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:05.570
of very smart doctor say here's what we
can do in Great Britain to make care

00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:05.580
can do in Great Britain to make care
 

00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:07.099
can do in Great Britain to make care
better so what they did was they had a

00:35:07.099 --> 00:35:07.109
better so what they did was they had a
 

00:35:07.109 --> 00:35:12.980
better so what they did was they had a
system built by systems people exactly

00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:12.990
system built by systems people exactly
 

00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:16.640
system built by systems people exactly
yeah and so they don't have what so by

00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:16.650
yeah and so they don't have what so by
 

00:35:16.650 --> 00:35:18.800
yeah and so they don't have what so by
having a collaborative build up at the

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:18.810
having a collaborative build up at the
 

00:35:18.810 --> 00:35:21.680
having a collaborative build up at the
front end and then we also said that the

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:21.690
front end and then we also said that the
 

00:35:21.690 --> 00:35:24.500
front end and then we also said that the
system is going to be basically vanilla

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:24.510
system is going to be basically vanilla
 

00:35:24.510 --> 00:35:27.109
system is going to be basically vanilla
upfront so we're going to the same

00:35:27.109 --> 00:35:27.119

00:35:27.119 --> 00:35:29.240

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:53.410
things you can do differently on the
 

00:35:53.410 --> 00:35:55.260
things you can do differently on the
screen but everybody has their name and

00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:55.270
screen but everybody has their name and
 

00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:56.700
screen but everybody has their name and
everybody has a rage and everybody has a

00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:56.710
everybody has a rage and everybody has a
 

00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:58.920
everybody has a rage and everybody has a
diagnosis we use the same coding

00:35:58.920 --> 00:35:58.930
diagnosis we use the same coding
 

00:35:58.930 --> 00:36:00.600
diagnosis we use the same coding
everywhere and so the there's a

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:00.610
everywhere and so the there's a
 

00:36:00.610 --> 00:36:02.340
everywhere and so the there's a
standardization of the the basic

00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:02.350
standardization of the the basic
 

00:36:02.350 --> 00:36:04.530
standardization of the the basic
information that was really important

00:36:04.530 --> 00:36:04.540
information that was really important
 

00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:06.090
information that was really important
and there are some places that didn't do

00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:06.100
and there are some places that didn't do
 

00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:08.520
and there are some places that didn't do
that as well so if you don't have a

00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:08.530
that as well so if you don't have a
 

00:36:08.530 --> 00:36:12.210
that as well so if you don't have a
standard data sad if you don't have to

00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:12.220
standard data sad if you don't have to
 

00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:13.950
standard data sad if you don't have to
enter process and you don't have buying

00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:13.960
enter process and you don't have buying
 

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:16.500
enter process and you don't have buying
at the beginning and then you put out

00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:16.510
at the beginning and then you put out
 

00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:17.940
at the beginning and then you put out
electronic medical record and your

00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:17.950
electronic medical record and your
 

00:36:17.950 --> 00:36:19.260
electronic medical record and your
they're in trouble the other thing that

00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:19.270
they're in trouble the other thing that
 

00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:24.230
they're in trouble the other thing that
we did and this was hugely important is

00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:24.240
we did and this was hugely important is
 

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:28.050
we did and this was hugely important is
we deliver care for a living so we knew

00:36:28.050 --> 00:36:28.060
we deliver care for a living so we knew
 

00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:30.890
we deliver care for a living so we knew
that just having the data wasn't enough

00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:30.900
that just having the data wasn't enough
 

00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:33.360
that just having the data wasn't enough
that we had to have the data but then we

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:33.370
that we had to have the data but then we
 

00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:35.580
that we had to have the data but then we
had to have systems that extract of the

00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:35.590
had to have systems that extract of the
 

00:36:35.590 --> 00:36:37.710
had to have systems that extract of the
data the reach into the computer pull

00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:37.720
data the reach into the computer pull
 

00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:39.840
data the reach into the computer pull
the data out and for a given doctor say

00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:39.850
the data out and for a given doctor say
 

00:36:39.850 --> 00:36:43.410
the data out and for a given doctor say
for your panel of 2,000 patients here

00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:43.420
for your panel of 2,000 patients here
 

00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:45.420
for your panel of 2,000 patients here
are the six people that most need

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:45.430
are the six people that most need
 

00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:47.070
are the six people that most need
attention and here's the attention they

00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:47.080
attention and here's the attention they
 

00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:50.340
attention and here's the attention they
need that type of thing and we have been

00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:50.350
need that type of thing and we have been
 

00:36:50.350 --> 00:36:51.930
need that type of thing and we have been
experimenting so we've got eight

00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:51.940
experimenting so we've got eight
 

00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:54.690
experimenting so we've got eight
different versions of that which is a

00:36:54.690 --> 00:36:54.700
different versions of that which is a
 

00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:56.850
different versions of that which is a
good thing because we're doing it a

00:36:56.850 --> 00:36:56.860
good thing because we're doing it a
 

00:36:56.860 --> 00:36:58.110
good thing because we're doing it a
little differently in Hawaii than we're

00:36:58.110 --> 00:36:58.120
little differently in Hawaii than we're
 

00:36:58.120 --> 00:36:59.130
little differently in Hawaii than we're
doing at Portland we're doing it

00:36:59.130 --> 00:36:59.140
doing at Portland we're doing it
 

00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:01.620
doing at Portland we're doing it
differently in Denver and we're learning

00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:01.630
differently in Denver and we're learning
 

00:37:01.630 --> 00:37:04.140
differently in Denver and we're learning
from ourselves be in if there would have

00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:04.150
from ourselves be in if there would have
 

00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:06.710
from ourselves be in if there would have
been a single perfect template somewhere

00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:06.720
been a single perfect template somewhere
 

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:09.810
been a single perfect template somewhere
for that extract process we would have

00:37:09.810 --> 00:37:09.820
for that extract process we would have
 

00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:13.530
for that extract process we would have
gone there there isn't so we're learning

00:37:13.530 --> 00:37:13.540
gone there there isn't so we're learning
 

00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:15.060
gone there there isn't so we're learning
that as we go so we're building the

00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:15.070
that as we go so we're building the
 

00:37:15.070 --> 00:37:16.680
that as we go so we're building the
pieces of it and now we're sitting down

00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:16.690
pieces of it and now we're sitting down
 

00:37:16.690 --> 00:37:19.140
pieces of it and now we're sitting down
comparing how well does what we're doing

00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:19.150
comparing how well does what we're doing
 

00:37:19.150 --> 00:37:21.300
comparing how well does what we're doing
at Portland do compared to what we're

00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:21.310
at Portland do compared to what we're
 

00:37:21.310 --> 00:37:23.400
at Portland do compared to what we're
doing in Hawaii and what can we learn

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:23.410
doing in Hawaii and what can we learn
 

00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:24.810
doing in Hawaii and what can we learn
from Hawaii that will transfer to

00:37:24.810 --> 00:37:24.820
from Hawaii that will transfer to
 

00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:29.040
from Hawaii that will transfer to
Washington DC it's a very exciting

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:29.050
Washington DC it's a very exciting
 

00:37:29.050 --> 00:37:31.830
Washington DC it's a very exciting
process we got a lot of very very bright

00:37:31.830 --> 00:37:31.840
process we got a lot of very very bright
 

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:33.840
process we got a lot of very very bright
people right now who are highly

00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:33.850
people right now who are highly
 

00:37:33.850 --> 00:37:36.960
people right now who are highly
energized and very excited about the the

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:36.970
energized and very excited about the the
 

00:37:36.970 --> 00:37:39.390
energized and very excited about the the
opportunity to do this work and I've

00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:39.400
opportunity to do this work and I've
 

00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:41.880
opportunity to do this work and I've
heard several people describe it as

00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:41.890
heard several people describe it as
 

00:37:41.890 --> 00:37:43.620
heard several people describe it as
being like the internet when the

00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:43.630
being like the internet when the
 

00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:46.800
being like the internet when the
internet came into being people had a

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:46.810
internet came into being people had a
 

00:37:46.810 --> 00:37:49.050
internet came into being people had a
few generic ideas about they might do

00:37:49.050 --> 00:37:49.060
few generic ideas about they might do
 

00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:51.660
few generic ideas about they might do
with it and then those ideas expanded

00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:51.670
with it and then those ideas expanded
 

00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:54.840
with it and then those ideas expanded
and expanded and expanded and and now

00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:54.850
and expanded and expanded and and now
 

00:37:54.850 --> 00:37:56.950
and expanded and expanded and and now
there's a vast expansion

00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:56.960
there's a vast expansion
 

00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:59.050
there's a vast expansion
of all the kinds of things you can do

00:37:59.050 --> 00:37:59.060
of all the kinds of things you can do
 

00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:00.970
of all the kinds of things you can do
for connectivity and we're doing the

00:38:00.970 --> 00:38:00.980
for connectivity and we're doing the
 

00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:04.450
for connectivity and we're doing the
same thing we're we're expanding as well

00:38:04.450 --> 00:38:04.460
same thing we're we're expanding as well
 

00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:05.920
same thing we're we're expanding as well
we're also redefining the patient

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:05.930
we're also redefining the patient
 

00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:07.510
we're also redefining the patient
experience because the patients can not

00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:07.520
experience because the patients can not
 

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:09.040
experience because the patients can not
only get their medical record

00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:09.050
only get their medical record
 

00:38:09.050 --> 00:38:10.720
only get their medical record
electronically so each of our patients

00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:10.730
electronically so each of our patients
 

00:38:10.730 --> 00:38:12.849
electronically so each of our patients
can get their barrel medical record when

00:38:12.849 --> 00:38:12.859
can get their barrel medical record when
 

00:38:12.859 --> 00:38:14.980
can get their barrel medical record when
they when they want it but the other

00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:14.990
they when they want it but the other
 

00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:18.700
they when they want it but the other
thing that that's fascinating about they

00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:18.710
thing that that's fascinating about they
 

00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:20.380
thing that that's fascinating about they
you can also even travel with it if you

00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:20.390
you can also even travel with it if you
 

00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:21.550
you can also even travel with it if you
want to put it on a little drive and

00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:21.560
want to put it on a little drive and
 

00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:23.859
want to put it on a little drive and
take it along you can get it along but

00:38:23.859 --> 00:38:23.869
take it along you can get it along but
 

00:38:23.869 --> 00:38:25.810
take it along you can get it along but
the interesting thing is what patients

00:38:25.810 --> 00:38:25.820
the interesting thing is what patients
 

00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:30.520
the interesting thing is what patients
really like a lot is he visits really

00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:30.530
really like a lot is he visits really
 

00:38:30.530 --> 00:38:34.510
really like a lot is he visits really
like electronic visits in three years

00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:34.520
like electronic visits in three years
 

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:36.250
like electronic visits in three years
ago and we introduced electronic visits

00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:36.260
ago and we introduced electronic visits
 

00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:39.630
ago and we introduced electronic visits
we had 1 million patients first year

00:38:39.630 --> 00:38:39.640
we had 1 million patients first year
 

00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:43.390
we had 1 million patients first year
second year 3 million this year 6

he visits this year and I think there's

00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:47.630
he visits this year and I think there's
 

00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:49.810
he visits this year and I think there's
a good chance it will go to 12 I think

00:38:49.810 --> 00:38:49.820
a good chance it will go to 12 I think
 

00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:52.329
a good chance it will go to 12 I think
we're on the exponential growth in the

we're on the exponential growth in the
 

00:38:52.339 --> 00:38:53.859
we're on the exponential growth in the
reasons pointers because the patients

00:38:53.859 --> 00:38:53.869
reasons pointers because the patients
 

00:38:53.869 --> 00:38:58.380
reasons pointers because the patients
absolutely love it now I'm curious

00:38:58.380 --> 00:38:58.390
absolutely love it now I'm curious

actually worked really well was just a
 

00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:46.990
actually worked really well was just a
simple pilot that took a bunch of

issue was they actually got emails from

00:41:03.039 --> 00:41:03.049
issue was they actually got emails from
 

00:41:03.049 --> 00:41:05.079
issue was they actually got emails from
us reminding them and the people who

00:41:05.079 --> 00:41:05.089
us reminding them and the people who
 

00:41:05.089 --> 00:41:07.599
us reminding them and the people who
were getting those reminders over a few

that's a very kind of low tech high tech

00:41:12.819 --> 00:41:12.829
that's a very kind of low tech high tech
 

00:41:12.829 --> 00:41:15.190
that's a very kind of low tech high tech
type of thing but it's the kind of thing

00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:15.200
type of thing but it's the kind of thing
 

00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:17.710
type of thing but it's the kind of thing
that you don't do up front then you

00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:17.720
that you don't do up front then you
 

00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:18.819
that you don't do up front then you
start thinking about what kind of

00:41:18.819 --> 00:41:18.829
start thinking about what kind of
 

00:41:18.829 --> 00:41:20.440
start thinking about what kind of
connectivity can we have and how can we

00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:20.450
connectivity can we have and how can we
 

00:41:20.450 --> 00:41:22.779
connectivity can we have and how can we
use this equipment and a in an

00:41:22.779 --> 00:41:22.789
use this equipment and a in an
 

00:41:22.789 --> 00:41:25.839
use this equipment and a in an
interesting way and again we've got some

00:41:25.839 --> 00:41:25.849
interesting way and again we've got some
 

00:41:25.849 --> 00:41:27.910
interesting way and again we've got some
very smart people who are doing the

00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:27.920
very smart people who are doing the
 

00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:31.210
very smart people who are doing the
other thing that's really fun is the

00:41:31.210 --> 00:41:31.220
other thing that's really fun is the
 

00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:33.579
other thing that's really fun is the
research because we can do research and

00:41:33.579 --> 00:41:33.589
research because we can do research and
 

00:41:33.589 --> 00:41:35.950
research because we can do research and
nobody else can do so we went back and

00:41:35.950 --> 00:41:35.960
nobody else can do so we went back and
 

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:38.259
nobody else can do so we went back and
took a look at patient data that we had

00:41:38.259 --> 00:41:38.269
took a look at patient data that we had
 

00:41:38.269 --> 00:41:41.680
took a look at patient data that we had
from 35 years ago and we still have the

00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:41.690
from 35 years ago and we still have the
 

00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:43.509
from 35 years ago and we still have the
patience because we because of who we

00:41:43.509 --> 00:41:43.519
patience because we because of who we
 

00:41:43.519 --> 00:41:45.519
patience because we because of who we
are we keep patients for a very long

00:41:45.519 --> 00:41:45.529
are we keep patients for a very long
 

00:41:45.529 --> 00:41:48.490
are we keep patients for a very long
time so we have 35 years of data and we

00:41:48.490 --> 00:41:48.500
time so we have 35 years of data and we
 

00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:51.460
time so we have 35 years of data and we
identified that if you had high

00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:51.470
identified that if you had high
 

00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:56.019
identified that if you had high
cholesterol in your 40s and you had a

00:41:56.019 --> 00:41:56.029
cholesterol in your 40s and you had a
 

00:41:56.029 --> 00:41:59.410
cholesterol in your 40s and you had a
certain weight issue you were three

00:41:59.410 --> 00:41:59.420
certain weight issue you were three
 

00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:01.390
certain weight issue you were three
hundred and sixty percent more likely to

00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:01.400
hundred and sixty percent more likely to
 

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:03.849
hundred and sixty percent more likely to
have Alzheimer's in your section three

00:42:03.849 --> 00:42:03.859
have Alzheimer's in your section three
 

00:42:03.859 --> 00:42:06.370
have Alzheimer's in your section three
hundred sixty percent more likely we

00:42:06.370 --> 00:42:06.380
hundred sixty percent more likely we
 

00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:08.799
hundred sixty percent more likely we
identified which population we went back

00:42:08.799 --> 00:42:08.809
identified which population we went back
 

00:42:08.809 --> 00:42:10.140
identified which population we went back
we could take the current database

00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:10.150
we could take the current database
 

00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:12.940
we could take the current database
across a broad population and then sort

00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:12.950
across a broad population and then sort
 

00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:14.829
across a broad population and then sort
back into the characteristics of those

00:42:14.829 --> 00:42:14.839
back into the characteristics of those
 

00:42:14.839 --> 00:42:18.940
back into the characteristics of those
people 30 years ago and identify several

00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:18.950
people 30 years ago and identify several
 

00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:21.319
people 30 years ago and identify several
very important things about them

00:42:21.319 --> 00:42:21.329
very important things about them
 

00:42:21.329 --> 00:42:24.670
very important things about them
and in one of them was that and this is

00:42:24.670 --> 00:42:24.680
and in one of them was that and this is
 

00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:30.259
and in one of them was that and this is
very scary for those of us who carry too

00:42:30.259 --> 00:42:30.269
very scary for those of us who carry too
 

00:42:30.269 --> 00:42:32.660
very scary for those of us who carry too
much weight and had high cholesterol in

00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:32.670
much weight and had high cholesterol in
 

00:42:32.670 --> 00:42:35.420
much weight and had high cholesterol in
our 40s the likelihood of Alzheimer's is

00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:35.430
our 40s the likelihood of Alzheimer's is
 

00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:38.029
our 40s the likelihood of Alzheimer's is
way way up which also might explain why

00:42:38.029 --> 00:42:38.039
way way up which also might explain why
 

00:42:38.039 --> 00:42:39.170
way way up which also might explain why
there are so many more cases of

00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:39.180
there are so many more cases of
 

00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:40.539
there are so many more cases of
Alzheimer's now than they used to be

00:42:40.539 --> 00:42:40.549
Alzheimer's now than they used to be
 

00:42:40.549 --> 00:42:42.709
Alzheimer's now than they used to be
because I mean it's those kinds of

00:42:42.709 --> 00:42:42.719
because I mean it's those kinds of
 

00:42:42.719 --> 00:42:44.539
because I mean it's those kinds of
things so we're taking that kind of

00:42:44.539 --> 00:42:44.549
things so we're taking that kind of
 

00:42:44.549 --> 00:42:47.089
things so we're taking that kind of
research and learning things that we

00:42:47.089 --> 00:42:47.099
research and learning things that we
 

00:42:47.099 --> 00:42:50.120
research and learning things that we
couldn't have learned without large

00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:50.130
couldn't have learned without large
 

00:42:50.130 --> 00:42:52.880
couldn't have learned without large
amounts of data that that's current

00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:52.890
amounts of data that that's current
 

00:42:52.890 --> 00:42:55.339
amounts of data that that's current
about patients and longitudinal data now

00:42:55.339 --> 00:42:55.349
about patients and longitudinal data now
 

00:42:55.349 --> 00:43:00.319
about patients and longitudinal data now
we're adding to that DNA so we're

00:43:00.319 --> 00:43:00.329
we're adding to that DNA so we're
 

00:43:00.329 --> 00:43:02.599
we're adding to that DNA so we're
collecting DNA samples and we will have

00:43:02.599 --> 00:43:02.609
collecting DNA samples and we will have
 

00:43:02.609 --> 00:43:05.029
collecting DNA samples and we will have
the biggest private DNA database in the

00:43:05.029 --> 00:43:05.039
the biggest private DNA database in the
 

00:43:05.039 --> 00:43:08.029
the biggest private DNA database in the
world in a very short time we'll have

00:43:08.029 --> 00:43:08.039
world in a very short time we'll have
 

00:43:08.039 --> 00:43:10.339
world in a very short time we'll have
about 400,000 people who have

00:43:10.339 --> 00:43:10.349
about 400,000 people who have
 

00:43:10.349 --> 00:43:14.539
about 400,000 people who have
voluntarily put their DNA into our

00:43:14.539 --> 00:43:14.549
voluntarily put their DNA into our
 

00:43:14.549 --> 00:43:17.390
voluntarily put their DNA into our
database by the end of this next year so

00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:17.400
database by the end of this next year so
 

00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:19.099
database by the end of this next year so
a 400,000 people at the end of the year

00:43:19.099 --> 00:43:19.109
a 400,000 people at the end of the year
 

00:43:19.109 --> 00:43:21.979
a 400,000 people at the end of the year
and we'll have all the DNA and we'll run

00:43:21.979 --> 00:43:21.989
and we'll have all the DNA and we'll run
 

00:43:21.989 --> 00:43:24.109
and we'll have all the DNA and we'll run
the profiles and we will then have the

00:43:24.109 --> 00:43:24.119
the profiles and we will then have the
 

00:43:24.119 --> 00:43:26.749
the profiles and we will then have the
medical profiles so we'll be able to

00:43:26.749 --> 00:43:26.759
medical profiles so we'll be able to
 

00:43:26.759 --> 00:43:29.390
medical profiles so we'll be able to
identify all kinds of things that the

00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:29.400
identify all kinds of things that the
 

00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:31.189
identify all kinds of things that the
discovery that's going to come out of

then they can get the inhaler and then
 

00:47:26.810 --> 00:47:29.110
then they can get the inhaler and then
they can get the medication but in

00:47:29.110 --> 00:47:29.120
they can get the medication but in
 

00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:30.790
they can get the medication but in
addition to that covering them is not

00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:30.800
addition to that covering them is not
 

00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:33.340
addition to that covering them is not
enough in addition to that we need to

00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:33.350
enough in addition to that we need to
 

00:47:33.350 --> 00:47:35.140
enough in addition to that we need to
have information about every kid with

00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:35.150
have information about every kid with
 

00:47:35.150 --> 00:47:36.910
have information about every kid with
asthma we need to know who they are and

00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:36.920
asthma we need to know who they are and
 

00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:41.320
asthma we need to know who they are and
then we need something tracking whether

00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:41.330
then we need something tracking whether
 

00:47:41.330 --> 00:47:42.910
then we need something tracking whether
or not those kids are getting the

00:47:42.910 --> 00:47:42.920
or not those kids are getting the
 

00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:44.200
or not those kids are getting the
appropriate care whether or not they

00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:44.210
appropriate care whether or not they
 

00:47:44.210 --> 00:47:45.640
appropriate care whether or not they
refill in the prescription like I talked

00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:45.650
refill in the prescription like I talked
 

00:47:45.650 --> 00:47:47.380
refill in the prescription like I talked
about earlier with the heart patient we

00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:47.390
about earlier with the heart patient we
 

00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:49.830
about earlier with the heart patient we
need to know if those inhalers are being

00:47:49.830 --> 00:47:49.840
need to know if those inhalers are being
 

00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:52.060
need to know if those inhalers are being
refilled and if they're not when you'd

00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:52.070
refilled and if they're not when you'd
 

00:47:52.070 --> 00:47:53.650
refilled and if they're not when you'd
intervene and what we really need to

00:47:53.650 --> 00:47:53.660
intervene and what we really need to
 

00:47:53.660 --> 00:47:55.930
intervene and what we really need to
know is if the kid has a crisis if they

00:47:55.930 --> 00:47:55.940
know is if the kid has a crisis if they
 

00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:57.970
know is if the kid has a crisis if they
have a asthma attack and they're in the

00:47:57.970 --> 00:47:57.980
have a asthma attack and they're in the
 

00:47:57.980 --> 00:48:00.430
have a asthma attack and they're in the
emergency room we need to know that that

00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:00.440
emergency room we need to know that that
 

00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:02.500
emergency room we need to know that that
crisis happened and then that needs to

00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:02.510
crisis happened and then that needs to
 

00:48:02.510 --> 00:48:05.140
crisis happened and then that needs to
trigger an intervention so that somebody

00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:05.150
trigger an intervention so that somebody
 

00:48:05.150 --> 00:48:06.670
trigger an intervention so that somebody
can do something meaningful to make it

00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:06.680
can do something meaningful to make it
 

00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:09.490
can do something meaningful to make it
better and in the current unconnected

00:48:09.490 --> 00:48:09.500
better and in the current unconnected
 

00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:12.880
better and in the current unconnected
system nobody knows no one has a clue so

00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:12.890
system nobody knows no one has a clue so
 

00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:15.790
system nobody knows no one has a clue so
the person has the asthma attack and the

00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:15.800
the person has the asthma attack and the
 

00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:17.350
the person has the asthma attack and the
hospital has an information for the

00:48:17.350 --> 00:48:17.360
hospital has an information for the
 

00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:19.060
hospital has an information for the
hospital has no one to give it to and

00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:19.070
hospital has no one to give it to and
 

00:48:19.070 --> 00:48:20.410
hospital has no one to give it to and
they have no mechanism to give it

00:48:20.410 --> 00:48:20.420
they have no mechanism to give it
 

00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:23.380
they have no mechanism to give it
through and so what you end up with is a

00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:23.390
through and so what you end up with is a
 

00:48:23.390 --> 00:48:25.000
through and so what you end up with is a
kid having another attack another attack

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:25.010
kid having another attack another attack
 

00:48:25.010 --> 00:48:27.610
kid having another attack another attack
another attack some die and then some

00:48:27.610 --> 00:48:27.620
another attack some die and then some
 

00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:30.970
another attack some die and then some
crippled and debilitated and certainly

00:48:30.970 --> 00:48:30.980
crippled and debilitated and certainly
 

00:48:30.980 --> 00:48:32.950
crippled and debilitated and certainly
demoralized and then it's a bad

00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:32.960
demoralized and then it's a bad
 

00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:36.070

we're going to fix that we're going to
 

00:48:39.410 --> 00:48:40.990
we're going to fix that we're going to
make that better and we're going to use

00:48:40.990 --> 00:48:41.000
make that better and we're going to use
 

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.000
make that better and we're going to use
universal coverage and the new database

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:43.010
universal coverage and the new database
 

00:48:43.010 --> 00:48:45.220
universal coverage and the new database
to do that so that's what we need to do

00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:45.230
to do that so that's what we need to do
 

00:48:45.230 --> 00:48:46.570
to do that so that's what we need to do
as a country and if we fix a few things

00:48:46.570 --> 00:48:46.580
as a country and if we fix a few things
 

00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:50.410
as a country and if we fix a few things
if we fix congestive heart failure you

00:48:50.410 --> 00:48:50.420
if we fix congestive heart failure you
 

00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:51.670
if we fix congestive heart failure you
know we can cut to congestive heart

00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:51.680
know we can cut to congestive heart
 

00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:53.670
know we can cut to congestive heart

until everybody has coverage and until

there's a care coordination process

there's a care coordination process
embedded in the coverage but there's no

embedded in the coverage but there's no
reason not to do that and we will save a

reason not to do that and we will save a
 

00:49:09.850 --> 00:49:12.330
reason not to do that and we will save a
lot of money for the country and will

lot of money for the country and will

lot of money for the country and will
save a lot of misery and agony and

save a lot of misery and agony and
 

00:49:15.370 --> 00:49:17.460
save a lot of misery and agony and

how to use I just talked about how to
 

00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:52.530
how to use I just talked about how to
use for asthma care but when when people

00:49:52.530 --> 00:49:52.540
use for asthma care but when when people
 

00:49:52.540 --> 00:49:54.690
use for asthma care but when when people
talk about technology what they

almost magical thinking let's put all

almost magical thinking let's put all

almost magical thinking let's put all
the data on a computer and then care

00:50:03.150 --> 00:50:03.160
the data on a computer and then care
 

00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:06.090
the data on a computer and then care
will get better well that doesn't work

00:50:06.090 --> 00:50:06.100

care doesn't get better when you put it

00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:07.690
care doesn't get better when you put it
 

00:50:07.690 --> 00:50:08.790
care doesn't get better when you put it
on the computer then you have to do

00:50:08.790 --> 00:50:08.800
on the computer then you have to do
 

00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:11.130
on the computer then you have to do
something with the data and somebody has

00:50:11.130 --> 00:50:11.140
something with the data and somebody has
 

00:50:11.140 --> 00:50:13.980
something with the data and somebody has
to be accountable for doing that and so

00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:13.990
to be accountable for doing that and so
 

00:50:13.990 --> 00:50:16.020
to be accountable for doing that and so
you have to create a data infrastructure

00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:16.030
you have to create a data infrastructure
 

00:50:16.030 --> 00:50:17.190
you have to create a data infrastructure
but then you have to create an

00:50:17.190 --> 00:50:17.200
but then you have to create an
 

00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:18.450
but then you have to create an
accountability and then you have to

00:50:18.450 --> 00:50:18.460
accountability and then you have to
 

00:50:18.460 --> 00:50:20.460
accountability and then you have to
create the mechanisms and if all you do

00:50:20.460 --> 00:50:20.470
create the mechanisms and if all you do
 

00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:21.930
create the mechanisms and if all you do
is put it on the computer that's not

00:50:21.930 --> 00:50:21.940
is put it on the computer that's not
 

00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:25.950
is put it on the computer that's not
enough and then people know that but

00:50:25.950 --> 00:50:25.960
enough and then people know that but
 

00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:28.260
enough and then people know that but
what people talk about a front is let's

what people talk about a front is let's
 

00:50:28.270 --> 00:50:30.360
what people talk about a front is let's
get all the data on the computer so if

00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:30.370
get all the data on the computer so if
 

00:50:30.370 --> 00:50:32.460
get all the data on the computer so if

lot of pressure due to computerize my
office and they go down that path and

office and they go down that path and
 

00:50:37.060 --> 00:50:38.670
office and they go down that path and
they invest all the money to computerize

00:50:38.670 --> 00:50:38.680
they invest all the money to computerize
 

00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:41.690
they invest all the money to computerize
their office and then when they're done

00:50:41.690 --> 00:50:41.700
their office and then when they're done
 

00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:44.880
