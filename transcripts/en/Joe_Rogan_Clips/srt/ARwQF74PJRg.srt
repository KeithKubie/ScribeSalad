1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,490
Nightmare. You're a dog
person, not a cat person.

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:05,070
I'm just saying I would like a
hairless cat. Oh, like a sphinx.

3
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:07,650
I think they're cool. This shit
in a box in your house. Perfect.

4
00:00:07,651 --> 00:00:11,580
So do I piss your house? I'm going to
change my toilet to be Roman. Fuck you.

5
00:00:11,581 --> 00:00:13,920
I'm going to shit in a box.
Yeah, they shit in a box.

6
00:00:13,921 --> 00:00:15,180
But that's a great thing to grow.

7
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:18,300
Sometimes my dog's crap on the carpet
with their, you know, irritable.

8
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,480
But cats are weird, man. Cats. I
don't know if you can trust a cat.

9
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:25,890
You try some cats. You have a couple of
cats, don't you? You've got a fucking zoo.

10
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:29,780
I'm so jealous. I want to come over and
just pet everything in your house. Oh,

11
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:34,530
my dog's died recently. Oh, I'm sorry. I
guess it was probably almost a year now.

12
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,340
It was Marshall Sad.
He didn't understand what was going on.

13
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,070
He looks like he's just pure joy and
happy all the time. He's the happiest.

14
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:44,990
He's so he brings me joy.
I just started following him on Instagram.

15
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,170
He's so happy. Follow your dog on
Instagram. He's my buddy. He's, he's,

16
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:53,610
it's so weird. Like you can see you
guys have a straight bond. Let's see.

17
00:00:53,611 --> 00:00:56,660
So affectionate. Do you run him off leash
in the morning when you go? Oh yeah.

18
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,640
Yeah. No tickets. You know, he's been, um,

19
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,920
he's got tick medication that he's taking,

20
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:05,490
but we have caught him with a couple of
ticks home without all that luxurious

21
00:01:05,491 --> 00:01:09,640
hair. Those ticks or Pi like match. He,

22
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:10,650
he loves it though.

23
00:01:10,651 --> 00:01:14,850
He never seen anything in is pure joy
as that dog is like running through the

24
00:01:14,851 --> 00:01:18,990
canyons. He just loves it. He's so happy.
So how do you keep him so clean? I mean,

25
00:01:18,991 --> 00:01:21,240
I know you got that.
Like Joe Rogan experience money,

26
00:01:21,241 --> 00:01:23,280
but he is luxurious cold water.

27
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,370
Well all it takes everyone
else to hear clones up water.

28
00:01:26,371 --> 00:01:29,310
And I've seen these mangled beasts,
they really don't.

29
00:01:29,311 --> 00:01:34,110
And they wonder why they
lash out. Marshall's not
like for cats. When you die,

30
00:01:34,111 --> 00:01:38,700
cattle start eating your face and like
16 hours dogs wait about a week. Yeah,

31
00:01:38,701 --> 00:01:40,650
they probably don't even wait that
long dog to wait about a week.

32
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,500
They love you a little bit more.
They won't eat you right away.

33
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,240
I don't even know if
Marshall would eat you.

34
00:01:45,241 --> 00:01:48,240
I think you'd wait even know what you
were probably wouldn't understand it.

35
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,640
He would just keep throwing balls at you.
Just rolling them over to you,

36
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:56,490
which is wine. My woke me up
yesterday was fucking really annoying.

37
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:58,440
Whining.
You just decides to get up.
