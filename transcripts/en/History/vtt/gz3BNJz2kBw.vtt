DANNY: Las Vegas Golden Knights
goalie, Marc-Andre Fleury, came

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.120
to us with a dream that he's had
in his head of a wicked muscle

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.790
car that he's always wanted.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.880
We tracked down this Chevelle,
got his stamp of approval

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.210
on it being the right car, and
we went to work on this thing.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.330
Let me tell you-- this
baby is cool as ice.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.210
Marc is here today
to check it out.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.330
Come on, brother.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.080
- As I was here?
- No way.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.420
It ain't here yet.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.580
I hope he fulfilled
this man's dreams.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.330
Ryan, my brother, come on!

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:30.500
Bring out Marc's car.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.920
[music playing]

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:34.920
[engine revving]

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:35.710
Sounds good.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:36.670
DANNY: Oh, yeah.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:37.500
Oh, yeah.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:45.420
[laughs] I'm just watching him.
- Oh my god.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.420
She looks awesome.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.880
DANNY: Oh, yeah.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.330
[engine revving]

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.880
Oh, man, that's awesome.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.540
DANNY (VOICEOVER):
Marc said he wanted

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.000
a fun and sinister car he
could drive the kids around in.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.670
Talk about an interesting
combo-- but right up our alley.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.080
On the outside, we started with
a glossy jet black paint job

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.460
and added matte black
18-inch Ridler wheels

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.290
to complement that badass look.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.960
Inside, Paulie did his thing--

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.250
complimenting that
beautiful black exterior

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.040
with a blood red
interior and bench seats

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.040
shaped like buckets in the front
for a unique and comfortable

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.460
look.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.540
Then finally, Marc
wanted the car to be fun.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.750
So we put in an
LS2 engine pushing

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.710
500 horsepower, Hooker Headers,
and Borla dual exhaust.

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.460
We also equipped this baby with
tubular control arms, front

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.920
and rear coilovers, and Wilwood
brakes all the way around

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.290
so that he'll be driving
in comfort and style

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.960
while having fun every
time he steps on the gas.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.880
[engine revving]

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.830
[laughs]

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.500
Oh, that's awesome.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.290
[laughs]

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.580
You know, and-- and that's why
going to the LS motor was great

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.420
because when you're on the
road, you know, traveling,

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.330
and you do a lot of that,
you just come home--

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:57.500
it's sitting in your garage.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.170
It just will start
up every time.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.330
You don't even have
to hit the gas.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.670
It sounds wicked,
though, right?

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.250
- It sounds awesome, yes.
- Right on.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.290
So you've got tubular control
arms in your suspension.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.170
You've got coilover suspension
in all four corners.

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.080
So it's fully
adjustable for height,

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.170
and dampening, and stiffness,
and things like that.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.830
Paulie went crazy with
that beautiful canvas top.

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.330
Usually, you know, on the muscle
cars, they do, like, that--

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.500
like, a vinyl convertible top--

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.120
high-end canvas top on it.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.830
I wasn't too sure either.

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.290
I didn't know if I should have
went all blacked out, right?

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.330
But I really like the
little touches of chrome

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.500
around the car.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.040
I think it puts it
together, right?

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.210
RYAN: It's perfect.

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:35.290
You did a hell of a job.
The black--

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.460
No.
You did a hell of a job.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:37.710
RYAN: --blacking
out the bumpers--

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.120
I wasn't too sure about--

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.380
MARC-ANDR FLEURY: The
black bumpers, yeah?

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.290
RYAN: But man,
changed the whole car.

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.500
DANNY: I like them.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.000
It's just really
sinister back here.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.500
MARC-ANDR FLEURY: Yeah.
Looking good.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.040
DANNY: You know?

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.380
RYAN: This is my favorite part.
MARC-ANDR FLEURY: Yeah.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.540
In the trunk?
KEVIN: This is fantastic.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.710
DANNY: Bam.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:53.710
Just like your interior.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:54.880
MARC-ANDR FLEURY: Perfect.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.710
It compartments
your stereo setup.

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.000
So you got a lot of
sound in the car.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.210
But you don't see it.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.380
That still can
fit my hockey bags.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.790
So it's--
RYAN: Exactly.

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:03.460
KEVIN: It's perfect.
MARC-ANDR FLEURY: Yeah.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.790
That's good.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.040
Sticks out the window,
bag in the trunk?

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.380
[laughter]

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.420
I've been there.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.330
I love it.
Thump.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.080
I think we should
look under the hood.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.500
Yeah.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.250
DANNY: You perform on
the ice constantly.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.710
So you wanted something
that's American muscle

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.830
that you can drive every day
and have your performance.

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.750
So hiding under
here is a gorgeous--

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:26.540
MARC-ANDR FLEURY: Jeez.

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:27.580
Yeah.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:28.750
DANNY: --LS2.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.210
I like your
little touch there.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.210
Absolutely-- pushing
just about 500 horse--

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:35.170
Really?
Yeah?

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.040
DANNY: --in this car.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.420
It can get up there?

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.710
DANNY: Absolutely.
MARC-ANDR FLEURY: I know.

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:39.920
It looks awesome.
DANNY: Feels good?

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:40.540
MARC-ANDR FLEURY: Oh, yeah.
Yeah.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.250
For sure.

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.250
[laughs]
Jeez.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.380
Absolutely.
Thank you.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.250
Good.
I-- I know.

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.830
I know.
I don't want to touch it.

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.750
So Marc, now that you are a
classic American muscle car

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.120
owner--
- Yeah.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.420
--how you feeling about it?

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:56.790
Pretty good.

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.710
DANNY: I got to
say, I dig the car.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.790
But most importantly,
I'm glad that you dig it.

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.290
Thank you.
DANNY: Yeah, man.

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.420
So all we ask now is that
you put a big giant cup

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.750
in the back seat here.
[laughs]

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.880
Yeah.
I'll drive around with it.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.790
DANNY: Drive down with
a big cup in the back.

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.290
And-- your key.
- Thank you.

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.710
Absolutely, man.

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:16.790
Man, I got to tell
you-- having an NHL

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.250
hockey team right here in
the desert of Las Vegas

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:20.580
is seriously sweet.

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.540
Having one that went
to the Stanley Cup

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:23.960
in its very first season--

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.420
that's insane.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.920
And Marc-Andr Fleury
was a huge part of that.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.960
And today, I'm so happy
that we made this man

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.620
as happy as he made our city.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.170
I'm sure he's looking
forward to hitting

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.080
the streets in his
beautiful wicked Chevelle.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.830
And we're looking
forward to watching

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.330
the Golden Knights hit the ice
and make this city happy again.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.000
Stanley Cup, here we come!

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.420
Man, I'm glad you're happy, bro.
- Yeah.

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:47.670
Thank you.

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:48.960
It makes us happy
to make you happy.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:49.830
[laughs]
- Appreciate that.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.290
Amen.
Amen.

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:52.120
Let's go finish this up.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.500
All right.
