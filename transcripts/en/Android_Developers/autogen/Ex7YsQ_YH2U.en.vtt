Android actually uses an embedded

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230
Android actually uses an embedded
 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.500
Android actually uses an embedded
webview in order to display the contents

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510
webview in order to display the contents
 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.960
webview in order to display the contents
of the conversation we have all the HTML

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970
of the conversation we have all the HTML
 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.790
of the conversation we have all the HTML
fragments for each message in the

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800
fragments for each message in the
 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.530
fragments for each message in the
conversation stored in a database and

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540
conversation stored in a database and
 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.120
conversation stored in a database and
then we put to put those together and

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130
then we put to put those together and
 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.400
then we put to put those together and
display them in a web view but webview

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410
display them in a web view but webview
 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.690
display them in a web view but webview
actually looks like it's part of the

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700
actually looks like it's part of the
 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.490
actually looks like it's part of the
Gmail application because it is part of

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500
Gmail application because it is part of
 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.410
Gmail application because it is part of
the Gmail application for example if I

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420
the Gmail application for example if I
 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.600
the Gmail application for example if I
bring up the menu the menu contains all

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610
bring up the menu the menu contains all
 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.250
bring up the menu the menu contains all
the menu items you'd expect to see in

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260
the menu items you'd expect to see in
 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.799
the menu items you'd expect to see in
Gmail and not the kind of menu items

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809
Gmail and not the kind of menu items
 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.200
Gmail and not the kind of menu items
you'd expect to see in the browser

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210
you'd expect to see in the browser
 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.880
you'd expect to see in the browser
there's also two-way communication

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890
there's also two-way communication
 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.610
there's also two-way communication
between the content that's displayed in

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620
between the content that's displayed in
 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.260
between the content that's displayed in
the webview and the java application

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270
the webview and the java application
 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.990
the webview and the java application
that the Gmail application itself so for

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000
that the Gmail application itself so for
 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.029
that the Gmail application itself so for
example if I touch on the first item in

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039
example if I touch on the first item in
 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.219
example if I touch on the first item in
the list you can see that it expands and

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229
the list you can see that it expands and
 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.920
the list you can see that it expands and
the content for that comes from the

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930
the content for that comes from the
 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.690
the content for that comes from the
JavaScript that's running inside the

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700
JavaScript that's running inside the
 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.020
JavaScript that's running inside the
webview calling out into my Java code to

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030
webview calling out into my Java code to
 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.640
webview calling out into my Java code to
get the next fragment for HTML and

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650
get the next fragment for HTML and
 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.429
get the next fragment for HTML and
putting it back into the Dom you can

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439
putting it back into the Dom you can
 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.080
putting it back into the Dom you can
also have communication going the other

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090
also have communication going the other
 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.469
also have communication going the other
way

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479
way
 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.580
way
so if I star a message then my Java code

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590
so if I star a message then my Java code
 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.679
so if I star a message then my Java code
is going to push a change into the Dom

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689
is going to push a change into the Dom
 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.230
is going to push a change into the Dom
by executing some JavaScript and you can

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240
by executing some JavaScript and you can
 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.660
by executing some JavaScript and you can
see that here now if you want to use

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670
see that here now if you want to use
 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.219
see that here now if you want to use
these techniques yourself we have some

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229
these techniques yourself we have some
 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.960
these techniques yourself we have some
sample code available on the apps for

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970
sample code available on the apps for
 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.850
sample code available on the apps for
Android site that shows how to embed a

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860
Android site that shows how to embed a
 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.800
Android site that shows how to embed a
webview and how to have communication in

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810
webview and how to have communication in
 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.300
webview and how to have communication in
and out of that webview from your

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310
and out of that webview from your
 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.370
and out of that webview from your
activity using a webview is a really

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380
activity using a webview is a really
 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.749
activity using a webview is a really
good option if you already have a lot of

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759
good option if you already have a lot of
 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.179
good option if you already have a lot of
content and HTML and JavaScript and it

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189
content and HTML and JavaScript and it
 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.289
content and HTML and JavaScript and it
provides a really nice seamless

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299
provides a really nice seamless
 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.170
provides a really nice seamless
experience for the user
