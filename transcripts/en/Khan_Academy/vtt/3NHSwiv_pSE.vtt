00:00:00.571 --> 00:00:01.605
I've gotten feedback

00:00:01.605 --> 00:00:03.769
that all the Chuck Noris imagery in the last video

00:00:03.769 --> 00:00:05.703
might have been a little bit too overwhelming.

00:00:05.703 --> 00:00:07.105
So, for this video, I've included

00:00:07.105 --> 00:00:09.769
something a little bit more soothing.

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:11.770
So let's try to simplify some more expressions.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:13.370
and we'll see we're just applying ideas

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.272
that we already knew about.

00:00:15.272 --> 00:00:20.998
So, let's say I want to simplify the expression 2(3x + 5).

00:00:21.059 --> 00:00:23.703
Well, this literally means two "3x + 5".

00:00:23.703 --> 00:00:25.855
So, this is the exact same thing as...

00:00:25.855 --> 00:00:28.032
So this is one "3x + 5",

00:00:28.032 --> 00:00:30.639
and then to that, I'm going to add another "3x + 5".

00:00:30.639 --> 00:00:33.904
This is literally what 2(3x + 5) means.

00:00:33.904 --> 00:00:36.104
Well this, is the same thing as...

00:00:36.104 --> 00:00:37.688
if we're gonna just have a look right over here,

00:00:37.688 --> 00:00:40.005
we have now two "3x".

00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:49.014
So, we can write it as 2(3x), plus we have two "5".

00:00:49.087 --> 00:00:52.171
So, plus 2(5).

00:00:52.171 --> 00:00:53.188
But, you might say: "Hey Sal,

00:00:53.188 --> 00:00:55.704
isn't this just the distributive property

00:00:55.704 --> 00:00:57.037
that I know from arithmetic?

00:00:57.037 --> 00:01:05.324
I've essentially just distributed the two "2(3x)" plus "2(5)",

00:01:05.324 --> 00:01:08.434
And I would tell you: "Yes, it is!"

00:01:08.434 --> 00:01:09.854
And, the whole reason why I'm doing this,

00:01:09.854 --> 00:01:10.780
is just to show you that it is

00:01:10.796 --> 00:01:12.769
exactly what you all already know.

00:01:12.769 --> 00:01:14.355
But with that out of the way,

00:01:14.355 --> 00:01:15.704
let's continue to simplify it.

00:01:15.704 --> 00:01:21.270
So, when you multiply the 2(3x), you get 6x.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.703
If you multiply the 2(5), you get 10.

00:01:24.703 --> 00:01:28.482
So, this simplifies to 6x + 10.

00:01:28.482 --> 00:01:30.317
Now, let's try something that's a little bit more involved.

00:01:30.396 --> 00:01:34.230
Once again, really just things that you already know.

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:54.591
So, let's say I had 7(3y - 5) - 2(10 +4y).

00:01:54.591 --> 00:01:56.503
Let's see if we can simplify this.

00:01:56.503 --> 00:01:59.638
Well, let's work on the left-hand side of the expression.

00:01:59.638 --> 00:02:01.571
The 7(3y - 5).

00:02:01.571 --> 00:02:03.438
We just have to distribute the "7".

00:02:03.438 --> 00:02:06.038
So, this is gonna be 7 times 3y,

00:02:06.038 --> 00:02:08.188
which is going to give us 21y,

00:02:08.188 --> 00:02:11.761
Or, if I had three "y" seven times, this is going to be 21y

00:02:11.771 --> 00:02:13.190
(either way you want to think about it).

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.187
And then I have "7" times...

00:02:15.187 --> 00:02:16.271
We're going to be careful with the sign.

00:02:16.271 --> 00:02:18.370
This is "7" times negative 5.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.521
"7" times "-5" is "-35".

00:02:22.521 --> 00:02:24.038
So, we simplified this part of it.

00:02:24.038 --> 00:02:25.271
Let's simplify the right hand side.

00:02:25.271 --> 00:02:27.605
So, you might be tempted to say:

00:02:27.605 --> 00:02:29.701
"Oh, "2" times "10" and "2" times "4y",

00:02:29.701 --> 00:02:31.472
and then subtract them,

00:02:31.472 --> 00:02:33.996
and if you do that right and distribute the subtraction,

00:02:33.996 --> 00:02:35.035
it would work out.

00:02:35.035 --> 00:02:39.478
But, I like to think of this as... "-2".

00:02:39.478 --> 00:02:42.103
And we're just going to distribute the "-2" times "10",

00:02:42.103 --> 00:02:46.938
and then we're going to distribute the "-2" times "4y".

00:02:46.938 --> 00:02:53.303
So, "-2" times "10" is "-20".

00:02:53.303 --> 00:02:56.303
(minus 20, right over here).

00:02:56.303 --> 00:02:58.945
And then "-2" times "4y"...

00:02:58.945 --> 00:03:00.493
"-2" times "4" is "-8",

00:03:00.493 --> 00:03:03.299
so it's going to be "-8y".

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.438
So, let's write a "-8y" right over here.

00:03:06.438 --> 00:03:08.521
And are we done simplifying?

00:03:08.521 --> 00:03:10.770
Well no, there's a little bit more that we can do.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.570
We can't add the "21y" to the "-35" or the "-20",

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.355
because these are adding different things

00:03:16.355 --> 00:03:17.605
or subtracting different things.

00:03:17.605 --> 00:03:20.606
But we do have two things that are multiplying "y".

00:03:20.606 --> 00:03:22.303
We have the...

00:03:22.303 --> 00:03:24.571
Let me do them all in this green color.

00:03:24.571 --> 00:03:26.105
You have 21y, right over here.

00:03:26.105 --> 00:03:33.170
And then, from that we are subtracting 8y.

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.903
So 21 of something...

00:03:34.903 --> 00:03:37.520
If I have 21 of something and I take 8 of them away,

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.188
I'm left with 13 of that something.

00:03:39.188 --> 00:03:42.438
So, those are going to simplify to 13y.

00:03:42.438 --> 00:03:51.715
And then, I have "-35" minus "20".

00:03:51.715 --> 00:03:56.216
And so, that's just going to simplify to "-55".

00:03:56.216 --> 00:03:57.837
So, this whole thing simplified,

00:03:57.837 --> 00:03:59.769
using a little bit of distributive property

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:01.938
and combining similar or like terms,

00:04:01.938 --> 00:04:06.400
we got to "13y - 55".
