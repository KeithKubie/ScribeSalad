00:00:07.617 --> 00:00:12.108
Prolonged space travel takes
a severe toll on the human body.

00:00:12.108 --> 00:00:15.558
Microgravity impairs muscle
and bone growth,

00:00:15.558 --> 00:00:19.730
and high doses of radiation
cause irreversible mutations.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.719
As we seriously consider the human
species becoming space-faring,

00:00:23.719 --> 00:00:26.220
a big question stands.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.568
Even if we break free 
from Earth's orbit

00:00:28.568 --> 00:00:31.791
and embark on long-duration
journeys among the stars,

00:00:31.791 --> 00:00:35.429
can we adapt to the extreme
environments of space?

00:00:35.429 --> 00:00:39.081
This won't be the first time that humans
have adapted to harsh environments

00:00:39.081 --> 00:00:41.699
and evolved superhuman capabilities.

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:45.201
Not fantastical powers like laser vision
or invisibility,

00:00:45.201 --> 00:00:50.330
but physiological adaptations
for survival in tough conditions.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.861
For example, on the Himalayan mountains

00:00:52.861 --> 00:00:56.514
where the highest elevation 
is nine kilometers above sea level,

00:00:56.514 --> 00:01:01.201
an unacclimated lowland human
will experience symptoms of hypoxia,

00:01:01.201 --> 00:01:03.570
commonly known as mountain sickness.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.680
At these altitudes, the body usually
produces extra red blood cells,

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.431
thickening the blood 
and impeding its flow.

00:01:10.431 --> 00:01:13.892
But Himalayans who have lived on
these mountains for thousands of years

00:01:13.892 --> 00:01:17.732
permanently evolved mechanisms
to circumvent this process

00:01:17.732 --> 00:01:19.881
and maintain normal blood flow.

00:01:19.881 --> 00:01:25.412
Cases like that prove that humans
can develop permanent lifesaving traits.

00:01:25.412 --> 00:01:28.142
But natural adaptation 
for entire human populations

00:01:28.142 --> 00:01:30.853
could take tens of thousands of years.

00:01:30.853 --> 00:01:35.113
Recent scientific advances may help us
accelerate human adaptation

00:01:35.113 --> 00:01:37.291
to single generations.

00:01:37.291 --> 00:01:40.063
To thrive as a species 
during space travel,

00:01:40.063 --> 00:01:41.831
we could potentially develop methods

00:01:41.831 --> 00:01:45.782
to quickly program protective abilities
into ourselves.

00:01:45.782 --> 00:01:48.882
A beta version of these methods
is gene therapy,

00:01:48.882 --> 00:01:52.863
which we can currently use to correct
genetic diseases.

00:01:52.863 --> 00:01:55.913
Gene editing technology,
which is improving rapidly,

00:01:55.913 --> 00:01:59.562
allows scientists to directly change
the human genome

00:01:59.562 --> 00:02:04.292
to stop undesirable processes
or make helpful substances.

00:02:04.292 --> 00:02:06.444
An example of an unwanted process

00:02:06.444 --> 00:02:11.323
is what happens when our bodies
are exposed to ionizing radiation.

00:02:11.323 --> 00:02:15.072
Without an atmospheric barrier
and a magnetic field like Earth's,

00:02:15.072 --> 00:02:19.973
most planets and moons are bombarded
with these dangerous subatomic particles.

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:21.893
They can pass through nearly anything

00:02:21.893 --> 00:02:26.548
and would cause potentially cancerous
DNA damage to space explorers.

00:02:26.548 --> 00:02:29.565
But what if we could turn the tables
on radiation?

00:02:29.565 --> 00:02:31.984
Human skin produces a pigment
called melanin

00:02:31.984 --> 00:02:34.805
that protects us from the filtered
radiation on Earth.

00:02:34.805 --> 00:02:38.513
Melanin exists in many forms
across species,

00:02:38.513 --> 00:02:41.174
and some melanin-expressing fungi

00:02:41.174 --> 00:02:45.755
use the pigment to convert radiation
into chemical energy.

00:02:45.755 --> 00:02:47.973
Instead of trying to shield 
the human body,

00:02:47.973 --> 00:02:49.755
or rapidly repair damage,

00:02:49.755 --> 00:02:51.574
we could potentially engineer humans

00:02:51.574 --> 00:02:57.674
to adopt and express these fungal,
melanin-based energy-harvesting systems.

00:02:57.674 --> 00:03:02.775
They'd then convert radiation into
useful energy while protecting our DNA.

00:03:02.775 --> 00:03:04.255
This sounds pretty sci-fi,

00:03:04.255 --> 00:03:07.796
but may actually be achievable 
with current technology.

00:03:07.796 --> 00:03:10.227
But technology isn't the only obstacle.

00:03:10.227 --> 00:03:12.385
There are ongoing debates 
on the consequences

00:03:12.385 --> 00:03:16.736
and ethics of such radical alterations
to our genetic fabric.

00:03:16.736 --> 00:03:18.936
Besides radiation,

00:03:18.936 --> 00:03:23.566
variation in gravitational strength
is another challenge for space travelers.

00:03:23.566 --> 00:03:27.611
Until we develop artificial gravity
in a space ship or on another planet,

00:03:27.611 --> 00:03:32.196
we should assume that astronauts
will spend time living in microgravity.

00:03:32.196 --> 00:03:35.387
On Earth, human bone and muscle
custodial cells

00:03:35.387 --> 00:03:38.640
respond to the stress 
of gravity's incessant tugging

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.915
by renewing old cells in processes
known as remodeling and regeneration.

00:03:43.915 --> 00:03:46.331
But in a microgravity environment
like Mars,

00:03:46.331 --> 00:03:49.437
human bone and muscle cells
won't get these cues,

00:03:49.437 --> 00:03:53.157
resulting in osteoporosis 
and muscle atrophy.

00:03:53.157 --> 00:03:56.245
So, how could we provide 
an artificial signal for cells

00:03:56.245 --> 00:03:59.352
to counteract bone and muscle loss?

00:03:59.352 --> 00:04:00.887
Again, this is speculative,

00:04:00.887 --> 00:04:04.510
but biochemically engineered microbes
inside our bodies

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.229
could churn out bone and muscle
remodeling signaling factors.

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:11.306
Or humans could be genetically engineered

00:04:11.306 --> 00:04:14.966
to produce more of these signals
in the absence of gravity.

00:04:14.966 --> 00:04:18.998
Radiation exposure and microgravity
are only two of the many challenges

00:04:18.998 --> 00:04:21.997
we will encounter in the hostile
conditions of space.

00:04:21.997 --> 00:04:24.577
But if we're ethically prepared
to use them,

00:04:24.577 --> 00:04:28.829
gene editing and microbial engineering
are two flexible tools

00:04:28.829 --> 00:04:31.797
that could be adapted to many scenarios.

00:04:31.797 --> 00:04:35.117
In the near future, we may decide
to further develop

00:04:35.117 --> 00:04:39.168
and tune these genetic tools
for the harsh realities of space living.
