00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.040
On a Jury you know your options: guilty, or
not. But there's another choice that neither

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.549
the judge nor the lawyers will tell you -- often
because they're not allowed to and also it

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:10.429
might better if you don't know.

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:14.019
This video will tell you that third choice,
but be warned: simply watching may prevent

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:18.080
you from ever serving on a jury -- so this
is your last chance to hit the pause button

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.610
before you learn about...

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.740
Jury nullification: when the defendant is
100% beyond-a-reasonable-doubt guilty but

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.960
the jurors also think he shouldn't be punished.
The jury can nullify the law and let him go free.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.040
But before your on your next jury and yell
'Null! Booya!' at the judge you should know

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.860
that just talking about jury nullification
in the wrong circumstances can get you arrested.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.230
Though a video such as this one, simply acknowledging
the existence of jury nullification and

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.989
in no way advocating it is totally OK. 
And, while we're at it:

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.109
(CGP Grey is not a lawyer, this is not legal advice,
it is meant for entertainment purposes only.

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:52.800
Seriously, guy, don't do anything in a court of law
based on what an Internet Video told you. No joke.)

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:57.340
So why can't you do this? It's because nullification
isn't in the law , but exists as a logical

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.239
consequence of two other laws:

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.819
First: that juries can't be punished for a
wrong decision -- no matter the witnesses,

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.940
DNA evidence or video proof show. 
That's the point of a jury: to be the decider.

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:13.220
and, Second: when a defendant is found not-guilty,
that defendant can't be tried again for the same crime.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.610
So there are only two stated options: guilty
or not, it's just that jury nullification

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.250
is when the words of the jurors don't match
their thoughts -- for which they can't be

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.320
punished and their not-guilty decision can't
be changed.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.420
These laws are necessary for juries to exist
within a fair system, but the logical consequence

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.860
is... contentious -- lawyers and judges argue
about jury nullification like physicists argue

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.840
about quantum mechanics. Both are difficult
to observe and the interpretation of both

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.950
has a huge philosophical ramification for
the subject as a whole.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.979
Is nullification the righteous will of the
people or an anarchy of twelve or just how

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:46.710
citizens judge their laws?

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.900
The go-to example in favor of nullification
is the fugitive slave law: when Northern juries

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.330
refused to convict escaped slaves and set
them free.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.350
Can't argue with that.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.119
But the anarchy side is Southern juries refusing
to convict lynch mobs. Not humanity

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.220
at its best.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.440
But both of these are juries nullifying the law.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.670
Also juries have two options where their
thoughts may differ from their words. Jury

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.370
nullification usually refers to the non-guilty
version but juries can convict without evidence

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.000
just as easily as they can acquit in spite
of it.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.980
This is jury nullification too and the jurors
are protected by the first rule, though the

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.190
second doesn't apply and judges have the power
to overrule a guilty verdict if they think

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.530
the jurors areâ€¦ nt the best. And, of course,
a guilty defendant can appeal, at least for

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.120
a little while. Which makes the guilty form
of jury nullification weaker than the not-guilty

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.510
kind. Cold comfort, though.

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.230
Given the possibility of jurors who might
ignore the law as written, it's not surprising

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.420
when picking jurors for a trial, lawyers -- whose
existence is dependent on an orderly society

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.810
-- will ask about nullification, usually in
the slightly roundabout way:

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.569
"Do you have any beliefs that might prevent
you from making a decision based strictly

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:48.330
on the law?"

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.239
If after learning about jury nullification
you think it's a good idea: answer 'yes' and

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.250
you'll be rejected, but answer 'no' with the
intent to get on the jury to nullify and you've

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.819
just committed perjury -- technically a federal
crime -- which makes the optimal strategy

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:02.709
once on a jury to zip it.

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.030
But This introduces a problem for jurors who
intend to nullify: telling the other 11 angry

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.019
men about your position is risky, which makes
nullification as a tool for fixing unjust

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:13.650
laws nation wide problematic.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.629
(Not to mention about 95% of criminal charges
in the United States never make it to trial

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:20.879
and rather end in a plea bargain, but that's
a story for another time.)

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:24.629
The only question about jury nullification
that may matter is if jurors should be told

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:28.450
about it and the courts are near universal
in their decision: 'no way'.

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.409
Which, again, might seem self-interested -- 
courts depend on the law -- but there's evidence

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:36.580
that telling jurors about nullification changes
the way they vote by making evidence less

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.349
relevant -- which isn't surprising: that's
what nullification is. But mock trials also

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:45.060
show sympathetic defendants get more non-guilty
verdicts and unsympathetic defendants get

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.870
more guilty verdicts in front of jurors
who were explicitly told about nullification

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.310
compared to those who weren't.

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.409
Which sounds bad, but it also isn't difficult
to imagine situations where jurors blindly

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:57.080
following the law would be terribly unjust
-- which is the heart of nullification: juries

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.239
judge the law, not solely evidence.

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.400
In the end righteous will of the people, or
anarchy, or citizen lawmaking -- the system

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.909
leaves you to decide -- but as long as courts
are fair they require these rules, so jury

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:13.909
nullification will always be with us.
