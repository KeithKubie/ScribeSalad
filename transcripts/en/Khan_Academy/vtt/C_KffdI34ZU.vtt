00:00:00.249 --> 00:00:03.686
- [Voiceover] The price of a
visit to the dentist is $50.

00:00:03.686 --> 00:00:05.822
If the dentist fills any cavities,

00:00:05.822 --> 00:00:08.852
an additional charge of $100 per cavity

00:00:08.852 --> 00:00:10.687
gets added to the bill.

00:00:10.687 --> 00:00:13.450
If the dentist finds n cavities,

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.888
what will the cost of the visit be?

00:00:15.888 --> 00:00:17.595
Write your answer as an expression.

00:00:17.595 --> 00:00:18.454
Alright, so we're talking about

00:00:18.454 --> 00:00:19.591
the cost of the visit.

00:00:19.591 --> 00:00:22.070
So you're gonna spend $50 no matter what.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.874
And then you're gonna
get an additional charge

00:00:24.874 --> 00:00:27.057
of $100 per cavity it tells us.

00:00:27.057 --> 00:00:29.785
An additional charge of $100 per cavity.

00:00:29.785 --> 00:00:32.386
So lets see, if you have n cavities

00:00:32.386 --> 00:00:35.288
it's gonna be $100 times n.

00:00:35.288 --> 00:00:37.958
I can just write this as 100n.

00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:39.386
Now lets see if this makes sense.

00:00:39.386 --> 00:00:41.627
If you have no cavities, if n is zero,

00:00:41.627 --> 00:00:44.019
then you're just gonna pay your $50.

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:45.911
But if you have one cavity,

00:00:45.911 --> 00:00:48.756
you're gonna pay your
$50 plus 100 times one.

00:00:48.756 --> 00:00:49.754
If you have two cavities,

00:00:49.754 --> 00:00:52.494
you're gonna pay $50
plus 100 times 2, yeah.

00:00:52.494 --> 00:00:54.120
This seems to make sense.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.559
So lets check our answer.

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.125
We got it right, lets
do another one of these.

00:00:58.125 --> 00:01:01.689
Sunny earns $12 per hour delivering cakes.

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:04.649
She worked of x hours this week.

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:06.929
She worked for X hours this week.

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:10.199
Unfortunately, she was charged $15

00:01:10.199 --> 00:01:12.359
for a late delivery on Tuesday.

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:15.552
How much money did Sunny earn this week?

00:01:15.552 --> 00:01:18.326
So if you see that she earns $12 per hour

00:01:18.326 --> 00:01:19.987
and she worked for x hours.

00:01:19.987 --> 00:01:24.352
Okay, she got $12 per hour times x hours.

00:01:24.352 --> 00:01:25.864
So that's how much she would've made

00:01:25.864 --> 00:01:27.789
except for the fact that she also had,

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:29.856
she was charged, I guess her employer,

00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:31.528
charges her for late delivery.

00:01:31.528 --> 00:01:34.628
So she had to take $15
out of her paychecks.

00:01:34.628 --> 00:01:35.951
So this is what she would've gotten paid

00:01:35.951 --> 00:01:37.623
based on her hourly wage

00:01:37.623 --> 00:01:39.086
and the number of hours she worked.

00:01:39.086 --> 00:01:41.919
But then she has that late
fee that she has to pay.

00:01:41.919 --> 00:01:44.357
So it's gonna be 12 x minus 15

00:01:44.357 --> 00:01:47.654
is how much she actually earned this week.

00:01:47.654 --> 00:01:50.611
Lets do a few more of these.

00:01:51.261 --> 00:01:55.491
There are c players on
the Cougars hockey team.

00:01:55.491 --> 00:01:59.624
The team scored a total
of 36 goals this season.

00:01:59.624 --> 00:02:03.583
One of the players, Matthew,
scored two more goals

00:02:03.583 --> 00:02:06.125
than the average per player.

00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:08.923
How many goals did Matthew score?

00:02:08.923 --> 00:02:11.478
Alright, well lets think
about the average per player.

00:02:11.478 --> 00:02:12.640
Cause we know that he scored two more

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.125
than the average player.

00:02:14.125 --> 00:02:17.039
So the average is going to
be the total number of goals

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:19.523
divided by the number of players.

00:02:19.523 --> 00:02:21.288
And they tell us that they're c players.

00:02:21.288 --> 00:02:23.355
So this expression right over here,

00:02:23.355 --> 00:02:25.154
that will tell us the average,

00:02:25.154 --> 00:02:29.195
that that's the average goals per player.

00:02:29.195 --> 00:02:31.052
Now we know Matthew scored two more

00:02:31.052 --> 00:02:32.422
than this thing over here.

00:02:32.422 --> 00:02:34.791
So we can just add two to that.

00:02:34.791 --> 00:02:37.821
And that's how many goals Matthew scores.

00:02:37.821 --> 00:02:39.887
Lets check our answer.

00:02:39.887 --> 00:02:41.153
Now the key here, this might
seem a little confusing,

00:02:41.153 --> 00:02:44.020
but remember, this says
Matthew scored two more goals.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.585
Two more goals than the average player.

00:02:47.585 --> 00:02:51.149
The average player, the
average goals per player

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:54.795
is 36 divided by c.

00:02:54.795 --> 00:02:57.935
Lets do one more of these.

00:02:58.881 --> 00:03:02.120
Hannah has 127 books in her collection.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.547
Her school is hosting a book donation.

00:03:04.547 --> 00:03:07.055
There are z students at her school

00:03:07.055 --> 00:03:09.423
and they each plan to donate
the same amount of books

00:03:09.423 --> 00:03:13.754
and reach a total donation of 300 books.

00:03:13.754 --> 00:03:17.655
How many books will Hannah
have in her collection

00:03:17.655 --> 00:03:19.884
after her donation?

00:03:19.884 --> 00:03:21.254
Alright, so lets think about it.

00:03:21.254 --> 00:03:23.819
Hannah has 127 books in her collection.

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.292
That's how much she has in her collection.

00:03:26.292 --> 00:03:28.452
Her school is hosting a book donation.

00:03:28.452 --> 00:03:30.251
There's z students at her school

00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:32.945
and they each plan to donate
the same amount of books

00:03:32.945 --> 00:03:36.254
and reach a total of 300 books.

00:03:36.254 --> 00:03:38.994
How many books will Hannah
have in her collection

00:03:38.994 --> 00:03:40.085
after her donation?

00:03:40.085 --> 00:03:42.094
So 127, and I know I just reread it

00:03:42.094 --> 00:03:43.487
cause that first time
I was like, okay wait,

00:03:43.487 --> 00:03:45.484
is 127 the amount of books that Hannah has

00:03:45.484 --> 00:03:48.810
or the amount that her school
has would be very clear.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.892
127 is the number of book Hannah has.

00:03:51.892 --> 00:03:54.052
Then she's gonna donate
some of those books.

00:03:54.052 --> 00:03:56.525
So she's gonna donate some
of those books to her school.

00:03:56.525 --> 00:03:57.593
And we have to figure out how much

00:03:57.593 --> 00:03:59.358
is she going to donate to her school.

00:03:59.358 --> 00:04:02.527
And we see that the
students, the z students

00:04:02.527 --> 00:04:04.826
plan on together, they each want to donate

00:04:04.826 --> 00:04:06.149
the same number of books

00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:08.750
and together they're
gonna donate 300 books.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.797
So how much is each
student going to donate?

00:04:12.197 --> 00:04:15.925
Well, if z students
together are donating 300,

00:04:15.925 --> 00:04:19.721
each student is going to
donate 300 divided by z.

00:04:19.721 --> 00:04:22.972
300 divided by z.

00:04:22.972 --> 00:04:26.084
And so Hannah starts with 127 books.

00:04:26.084 --> 00:04:29.398
She's going to donate her
share of books to the school.

00:04:29.868 --> 00:04:33.073
And each student is going to
donate 300 divided by z books.

00:04:33.073 --> 00:04:35.058
So Hannah is going to be left with

00:04:35.058 --> 00:04:37.856
127 minus 300 over z books

00:04:37.856 --> 00:04:39.801
after her donation.
