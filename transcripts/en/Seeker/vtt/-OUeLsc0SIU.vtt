00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.539
Some people get a great feeling when they
go for a run, called a runner’s high.

00:00:03.539 --> 00:00:08.240
It makes me wonder, are we meant to run?

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.690
Hey runners, Julia here for DNews

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.629
Some people say that running is good for you.

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:18.470
I firmly stand on the side of another DNews
video in which we claim running marathons

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:19.750
might be bad for you so.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.460
I just stay on my couch and marathon shows,
just to be on the safe side.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.030
Running is a high impact sport, you’d think
it would do a number on your joints and bones.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.530
But there’s plenty of people who love going
for a long run and research shows that we

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:32.710
may be built for it.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.890
Though there are some people in this world
who take it to an extreme.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.690
The Trans Europe Foot Race (TEFR) pushes running
to it’s limits.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.010
Over the course of 64 days runners will rack
up over 4,500 kilometers.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.329
With such a test of endurance, it’s no wonder
scientists were interested in how this kind

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.940
of long distance running effects the body.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.720
Over the course of the race, some of the runners
had full body MRI scans every few days.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.950
As you might expect and as other research
shows, such high impact activity did a number

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.170
on people’s joints.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.040
Within the first 2,000 kilometers almost all
cartilage in their knee, ankle and hind-foot

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.080
joints showed significant degradation.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.070
But here is the weird thing, even as the runners
continued to run the other 2,000 or so kilometers

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.500
they had left… their cartilage started to
regrow!

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.930
Even their achilles tendon grew in diameter.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.270
The researchers conclude that “The human
foot is made for running.”

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.440
So is that true?

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.840
Are we made for running?

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.619
Well according to a 2004 Nature study, yes
we are.

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.680
The researchers found certain physiological
adaptations make us efficient endurance runners,

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.030
so efficient that we can outrun almost every
animal on this planet.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.770
This is what’s called the “Endurance Running
Hypothesis”.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.729
It’s the idea that around 2 million years
ago, our homo erectus ancestors chased their

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.479
meals across the African savannah.

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.050
They didn’t have good enough tools to kill
from a distance, so they did the next best

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:51.050
thing.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.670
They hunted antelope or game by chasing them
across a long distance until the animal collapsed

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:56.670
from exhaustion.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.979
So what’s the evidence for this hypothesis?

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.770
Well one is the way we sweat.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.650
We evolved to chase our food in a really hot
climate.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.170
Most animals release excess body heat by panting.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.700
While this might help your dog cool down on
a hot summer day, painting actually gets in

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:11.739
the way of breathing.

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.250
So panting and running never go well together.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.930
For example, dogs can only run for about 15
minutes before they have to slow down.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.989
By releasing our heat through sweating, panting
doesn’t slow us down.

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:28.980
The 2004 Nature study pointed to the way our
ligaments and tendons are built.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.400
The researchers point to a specific ligament,
the Nuchal ligament that helps stabilize our

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.400
heads.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.880
Other running animals like horses, dogs, and
rabbits have a version of this ligament, but

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.191
our early ancestors, like Lucy who lived 4
million years didn’t have it.

00:02:42.191 --> 00:02:46.870
It only arose around 2 million years ago when
we left the safety of the trees for the open

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:47.870
savannah.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.239
Even our butts help us run according to some
of the same researchers.

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.440
Most other running and galloping animals have
tails.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.599
It helps them balance.

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:58.120
While humans are famous for our lack of a
behind appendage.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.070
Our big bottoms make up for it.

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.989
No other ape has such large hindquarters and
upper part of the gluteus maximus.

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.260
And according to research the butt doesn’t
do much when we’re just walking.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.190
It’s real power comes from when we break
into a run.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.080
So one of the researchers believes that the
butt is "basically a substitute for a tail”,

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.819
it helps us balance when we run, Other evidence
like short toes, large joints and slow twitch

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:22.840
muscle fibers adds more to the theory that
we were built to run.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.870
Even that ‘runner’s high’ might a gift
from evolution.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.489
In a study published in the Journal of Experimental
Biology, researchers found that some animals

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.099
get a high from running and others don’t.

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:35.349
A runner’s high is basically a neurobiological
reward.

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:39.680
Like other reward mechanisms in the brain,
it’s caused from a release of Endocannabinoids,

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.700
the chemicals that make us feel good.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.379
So the researchers measured the levels of
these chemicals in the brains of humans, dogs,

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:46.849
and ferrets after exercise.

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:51.319
And like I said earlier, it seems dogs and
humans are some of the only animals who partake

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.599
in endurance exercise, ferrets do not.

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:58.989
The researchers found that those endocannabinoids
were released in dogs and humans but not the

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:00.450
lazier ferrets.

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.659
So not only are we built for running, we also
enjoy it.

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:04.739
We get high from it.

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.730
Maybe I’ll go to hit the gym now.

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.890
Who I am kidding, the ferret is totally my
patronus.

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:21.250
I’m just gonna go marathon some superhero
shows.

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:27.949
So are you a ferret or a dog?

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:28.949
Do you enjoy running?

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:30.300
Or does it feel like torture?

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:36.339
