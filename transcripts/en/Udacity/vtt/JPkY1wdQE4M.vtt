00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.469
Here's what we came up with.

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:06.720
Remember, this is by no means
the only way to build this site.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.600
I'm sure your sites look totally
different than this one.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.520
And that is totally cool.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.690
Like always,
when I started working on this.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.630
I started with a small viewport.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.530
At a glance the most
noticeable improvement.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.130
Is the fact that the text
is now a lot larger.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.060
This is a nice change,
to help improve readability.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.290
As to the new location column
in the sports score table, well,

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.090
it disappeared on mobile.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.330
When there's enough room for
the locations, I went ahead and

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.830
added Display Block, to the location
class to make them show back up.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.430
When the viewport is now
in the desktop range.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.040
I decided to shrink the text in
the Sports table, to make room for

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.300
the location.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.830
While I would rather
make a totally different,

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:55.110
snazzier table to make everything fit,
I thought that making the font smaller

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.090
was a nice compromise to keep all
the information I wanted in the table.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.250
Next on my list of changes
is the Latest News section.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.519
In the old version,

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.080
I didn't really like the way the text
was wrapping around these images.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.610
And I also didn't like the fact that
these images were just so small.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.550
I decided to give myself
a little bit of flexibility.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.890
So I turned each article or
snippet, into a flexbox.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.410
You can tell that at the smallest screen
size, I've totally dropped the thumbnail

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.650
images, and I've gone ahead and
cropped the text to three lines.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.190
Adding this ellipses here to
the end of the last line,

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.260
isn't super simple actually.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.470
So if you want to do the same,

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.450
I suggest starting with the link that
you can find in the instructor notes.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:38.520
As the page gets wider,

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.840
the images show back up, and
they scale with the width of the page.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.910
Next up, I tackle the thumb
nail images for the articles.

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.620
Originally, these images were being
scaled down from an image that

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.440
was something like 2000 by 1400 pixels,
which is just absolutely massive.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.400
And way too big for this use.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.490
So I used image processing software,
to scale the image down to

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.900
twice the resolution of the largest
resolution thumbnails could take.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.190
With this layout, thumbnails don't get
any larger than 245 by 164 pixels.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.340
High density displays,
need higher density images.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.620
So, I scaled the image
down to 490 by 327 pixels,

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.780
which is a much smaller file.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.070

images responsively and

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:31.680
responsibly, try our Responsive Images
Course, made by Google's Sam Dutton.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.790
For the final version of this project.

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.230
I put all of my code in to final.css.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.390
It's essentially just
a series of breakpoints, and

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.980
then small changes to the snippets and
scores.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.470
I'm not going to go in-depth
to my code at the moment.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.770
But the instructor notes,
has instructions on how to download and

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.170
play with my source code.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.160
All in all, I'm pretty happy with
my copy of The Brighton Times.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.520
But, this is just my layout.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.230
I want to see what you've done, too.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.810
Make sure that you post all
of your sites in the forums.
