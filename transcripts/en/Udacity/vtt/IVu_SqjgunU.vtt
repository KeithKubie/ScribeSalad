00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
When you do this, when you type in 3Ï€/4 but for the sine you get a positive answer--0.71.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.000
For the cosine, you should got a negative answer of -.071, and let's think why is that--well, let's see.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Trigonometric ratios have to do with the sides of triangles.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
In this case, the sine was comparing opposite to hypotenuse.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Notice that the opposite side well it's pointing above the x axis--it's a positive number

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and the hypotenuse, well we always call that a positive number.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So opposite over hypotenuse, positive over positive gave me a positive number.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Cosine, well let's see. The adjacent it goes to the left of the y axis--that's a negative value.

00:00:40.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Adjacent of hypotenuse negative over positive gives me this -0.71.
