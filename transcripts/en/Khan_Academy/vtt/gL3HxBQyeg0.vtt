00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.670
Let's find the volume of
a few more solid figures

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:04.370
and then if we
have time, we might

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:06.520
be able to do some
surface area problems.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.940
So let me draw a
cylinder over here.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.310
So that is the top
of my cylinder.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.910
And then this is the
height of my cylinder.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.710
This is the bottom
right over here.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.250
If this was
transparent, maybe you

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.960
could see the back
side of the cylinder.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.490
So you could imagine this
kind of looks like a soda can.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:30.220
And let's say that the height of
my cylinder, h, is equal to 8.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.450
I'll give it some units.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.750
8 centimeters,
that is my height.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.370
And then let's say
that the radius of one

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.930
of the top of my
cylinder of my soda can,

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.030
let's say that this radius over
here is equal to 4 centimeters.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.620
So what is the volume here?

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.100
What is the volume going to be?

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.046
And the idea here is
really the exact same thing

00:00:54.046 --> 00:00:55.920
that we saw in some of
the previous problems.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.550
If you can find the
surface area of one side

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.860
and then figure out
how deep it goes,

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.630
you'll be able to
figure out the volume.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.463
So what we're going to
do here is figure out

00:01:04.463 --> 00:01:08.120
the surface area of the
top of this cylinder,

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.510
or the top of the soda can.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.720
And then we're going to
multiply it by its height.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.970
And that'll give us a volume.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.594
This will tell us
essentially, how many

00:01:15.594 --> 00:01:17.640
square centimeters
fit in this top.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.950
And then if we multiply
that by how many centimeters

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.190
we go down, then that'll
give us the number

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.790
of cubic centimeters in
this cylinder or soda can.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.477
So how do we figure
out this area up here?

00:01:30.477 --> 00:01:32.060
Well the area at the
top, this is just

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.570
finding the area of a circle.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.820
You could imagine
drawing it like this.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.570
If we were to just
look at it straight on,

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.460
that's a circle with a
radius of 4 centimeters.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.810
The area of a circle with a
radius 4 centimeters, area

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.070
is equal to pi r squared.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.580
So it's going to be pi
times the radius squared,

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.940
times 4 centimeters squared,
which is equal to 4 squared,

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.970
is 16, times pi.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.690
And our units now are going
to be centimeters squared.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.390
Or another way to think of
these are square centimeters.

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.630
So that's the area.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.460
The volume is going to be
this area times the height.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.480
So the volume is going
to be equal to 16 pi

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:24.486
centimeters squared, times the
height, times 8 centimeters.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.540
And so, when you
do multiplication,

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.420
the associative
property, you can kind of

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.700
rearrange these things, and
the commutative property.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.716
It doesn't matter
what order you do it

00:02:38.716 --> 00:02:39.840
if it's all multiplication.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.690
So this is the same
thing as 16 times 8.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:43.190
Let's see.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.400
8 times 8 is 64.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.860
16 times 8 is twice that.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.360
So it's going to be 128 pi.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.060
Now you have centimeter
squared times centimeters.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.430
So that gives us
centimeters cubed.

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.130
Or 128 pi cubic centimeters.

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.220
Remember, pi is just a number.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.130
We write it as pi,
because it's kind

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.770
of a crazy, irrational number,
that if you were to write it,

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.490
you could never
completely write pi.

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:13.010
3.14159 keeps going
on, never a repeat.

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.550
So we just leave it as pi.

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.091
But if you wanted to figure it
out, you can get a calculator.

00:03:17.091 --> 00:03:20.020
And this would be 3.14
roughly, times 128.

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:25.230
So it would be close to
400 cubic centimeters.

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.390
Now, how would we
find the surface area?

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.350
How would we find the surface
area of this figure over here?

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.890
Well, part of the surface area
of the two surfaces, the top

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:35.540
and the bottom.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.430
So that would be part
of the surface area.

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.600
And then the bottom
over here would also

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.650
be part of the surface area.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:51.490
So if we're trying to
find the surface area,

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.520
it's definitely going to have
both of these areas here.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.990
So it's going to have the 16
pi centimeters squared twice.

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:59.470
This is 16 pi.

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.920
This is 16 pi
square centimeters.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.670
So it's going to have 2 times
16 pi centimeters squared.

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.520
I'll keep the units still.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.432
So that covers the top and
the bottom of our soda can.

00:04:11.432 --> 00:04:13.140
And now we have to
figure out the surface

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.050
area of this thing
that goes around.

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:16.820
And the way I imagine
it is, imagine

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.170
if you're trying to wrap this
thing with wrapping paper.

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:22.019
So let me just draw a
little dotted line here.

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.130
So imagine if you were
to cut it just like that.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.730
Cut the side of the soda can.

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:30.540
And if you were to
unwind this thing that

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.830
goes around it,
what would you have.

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.890
Well, you would have something.

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.850
You would end up
with a sheet of paper

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.170
where this length
right over here

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.560
is the same thing as
this length over here.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.430
And then it would be
completely unwound.

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.710
And then these two
ends-- let me do it

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:52.040
in magenta-- these two ends
used to touch each other.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.680
And-- I'm going to do it in a
color that I haven't used yet,

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.380
I'll do it in pink--
these two ends used

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.940
to touch each other when
it was all rolled together.

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.780
And they used to touch each
other right over there.

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.100
So the length of this
side and that side

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.320
is going to be the same thing
as the height of my cylinder.

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.660
So this is going to
be 8 centimeters.

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.850
And then this over here is
also going to be 8 centimeters.

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.290
And so the question
we need to ask

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:21.430
ourselves is, what is
going to be this dimension

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.027
right over here.

00:05:23.027 --> 00:05:24.860
And remember, that
dimension is essentially,

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.382
how far did we go
around the cylinder.

00:05:28.382 --> 00:05:29.840
Well, if you think
about it, that's

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.980
going to be the exact same
thing as the circumference

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.240
of either the top or the
bottom of the cylinder.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.950
So what is the circumference?

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:39.689
The circumference
of this circle right

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:41.980
over here, which is the same
thing as the circumference

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:47.110
of that circle over there, it
is 2 times the radius times pi.

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.890
Or 2 pi times the radius.

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:57.460
2 pi times 4 centimeters, which
is equal to 8 pi centimeters.

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.230
So this distance right over
here is the circumference

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:02.780
of either the top or the
bottom of the cylinder.

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.440
It's going to be
8 pi centimeters.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:07.890
So if you want to
find the surface

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:09.780
area of just the wrapping,
just the part that

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.380
goes around the cylinder,
not the top or the bottom,

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.580
when you unwind it, it's going
to look like this rectangle.

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.790
And so its area, the
area of just that part,

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:22.300
is going to be equal to
8 centimeters times 8 pi

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:23.389
centimeters.

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:24.430
So let me do it this way.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:31.880
It's going to be 8 centimeters
times 8 pi centimeters.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.190
And that's equal to 64 pi.

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:36.260
8 times 8 is 64.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:40.472
You have your pi
centimeters squared.

00:06:40.472 --> 00:06:42.680
So when you want the surface
area of the whole thing,

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.610
you have the top,
you have the bottom,

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:45.950
we already threw those there.

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:47.510
And then you want to find
the area of the thing around.

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:48.551
We just figured that out.

00:06:48.551 --> 00:06:54.470
So it's going to be plus
64 pi centimeters squared.

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:56.770
And now we just have
to calculate it.

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:02.580
So this gives us 2 times 16
pi, is going to be equal to 32.

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:09.480
That is 32 pi centimeters
squared, plus 64 pi.

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.400
Let me scroll over to
the right a little bit.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.240
Plus 64 pi centimeters squared.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:23.330
And then 32 plus 64 is 96
pi centimeters squared.

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:26.760
So it's equal to 96 pi
square centimeters, which

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:30.830
is going to be a little bit
over 300 square centimeters.

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:32.890
And notice, when we
did surface area,

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:35.920
we got our answer in terms
of square centimeters.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.610
That makes sense,
because surface area,

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:40.430
it's a two-dimensional
measurement.

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:42.550
Think about how many
square centimeters can we

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:45.080
fit on the surface
of the cylinder.

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:48.680
When we did the volume,
we got centimeters cubed,

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:49.907
or cubic centimeters.

00:07:49.907 --> 00:07:51.740
And that's because we're
trying to calculate

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:58.170
how many one by one
by one centimeter

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:01.010
cubes can we fit inside
of this structure.

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:03.210
And so that's why it's
cubic centimeters.

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:07.180
Anyway, hopefully that clarifies
things up a little bit.
