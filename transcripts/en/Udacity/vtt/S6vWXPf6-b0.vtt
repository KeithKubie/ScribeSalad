00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.210
Let's answer a few other questions about these algorithms--alpha, beta and gamma.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:11.550
First, I want you to tell me whether the best-case running time for given input size

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:18.330
is always no longer than the best measured time for each algorithm--true or false.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.310
Also, I'd like you to tell me whether the worst-case running time for given input size

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.390
is at least the worst measured time for each algorithm.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.120
I also like to know whether algorithm beta is the fastest for all inputs, not just 100, 200,

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:40.710
300 and 400 but any input I get that is algorithm beta faster always than alpha and gamma.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.610
And finally, I'd like to know whether the small inputs the algorithm with exponential behavior

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.400
is sometimes faster than the algorithm with polynomial behavior.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.700
So tell me which of these statements are true and which are false.
