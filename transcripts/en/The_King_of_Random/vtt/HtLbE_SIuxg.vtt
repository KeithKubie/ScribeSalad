00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.630
Hey guys

00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.639
I'm Nate welcome back to the workshop in the past grant has shown you a pretty cool experiment that he came up with that involved

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:10.289
Microwaving a large glass jar with a little bit of water in it until it was really full of steam

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.460
Pouring out the boiling water and lowering the glass jar down into some ice-cold water

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.149
Causes the water to violently rush in and fill the entire container

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.430
we're going to try and replicate his experiment and then expand on that idea with a couple other experiments of

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.729
Making a vacuum in a jar without using a pump to start off

00:00:26.729 --> 00:00:30.900
Let's put a little bit of water in our jar and then microwave it for a couple minutes, so it's nice and hot

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.300
take our glass bottle and put out that

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.780
So it's still filling with water

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:51.209
But because it took me so long to walk over here from the microwave. It's not giving us the explosive result we're hoping for

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:53.969
It's still pulling in quite a bit of water, though

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:59.459
Clearly we need to act faster, so let's move our setup to the kitchen and try again there

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:08.729
Wow

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.070
Yeah that did a pretty good job of filling up with water right there that was pretty incredible

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.070
I mean look how full this bottle is that?

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.159
Is a very full bottle and so all of that water is

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.889
Displacing steam that was inside this bottle so we can see how much the steam

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.359
Shrinks as it cools down. That's a lot that is crazy

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.449
There's another method of creating a low pressure inside a jar like this that you may have seen before and we're gonna try and replicate

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.020
again

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.960
it involves lighting a fire inside the jar and

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.579
Plugging up the top to get our fire inside the jar let's take a strip of paper towel

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.299
Light that on fire with the lighter and then drop it down into the jar at that point

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.519
I'll cover the top and we'll see what happens

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.829
I took one of these gauges that we use on our vacuum chamber to measure the negative pressure inside our container

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.398
And I rigged it up, so I should be able to just pop it down on top of this jar

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.869
And if there's any negative pressure that forms inside it we should be able to get a good measure of it

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.250
I

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.350
Started catching

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.029
The flame burns out we should begin to see

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:25.310
Our needle starts to rise there goes that is not a lot of rise we got our needle. We are up to about

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.440
two and a half

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.290
Maybe three inches of mercury. That's a pretty small result but it is lower pressure

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:40.939
See if it's enough to lift our jar it is is enough to lift our jar buy pressure back in

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.019
That's kind of cool. You watch the swirling air inside there

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.389
Try and get our piece of paper towel out of the jar that's the fun part a

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:58.910
popular demonstration of what happens when you create the lower pressure inside the jar is to see if you can take a hard-boiled egg which

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.910
Does not fit through the neck of the jar

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.050
Light the fire down inside and have the lower pressure pull the egg through the neck of the jar

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.020
Inside the bottle let's try and see if that work

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.839
So we've got air expanding inside there from the heat

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.779
Now as it burns all the air up

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:29.330
some beautiful that just pulled it right down into the jar that worked great, so now we have a jar full of smoke and

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.010
An egg that we can't get out because it doesn't fit out of the neck

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:35.760
There's a whole lot of

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.620
remnants of our burned paper towel

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:44.269
inside the jar and I'm filling with water and in addition to clearing out the burn paper towel the water rising up also does a

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:49.279
Great job of displacing all of the oxygen less smoke. That's filling our jar

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.639
So it should be easier to do this experiment again after we pour out the water

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.989
Or we'll try and pour out the water in the egg. Yolk plug it up. Oh it did

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.730
Well, there is an egg

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.429
Plugging up our jar. It's a pretty good plug right there in an attempt to get the egg out

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.800
I'm gonna see what happens if I pour a little bit of liquid nitrogen into our jar then flip it upside down

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.149
Hopefully keeping the nitrogen behind the egg so the nitrogen will expand

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.670
Increase the pressure and push the egg out this might not work at all oh

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:30.159
We did that worked great now we have a jar full of nitrogen gas as well our egg a little worse for the wear

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.080
Being sucked into a bottle and then blown back out of the bottle so that worked pretty well

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.910
And now I want to try combining the two ideas

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.900
I want to put a little bit of water in our bottle microwave it up so it's nice and hot again

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.549
And then use our pressure gauge on the bottle as we lower it down into our iced water

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:51.910
To see how much of a vacuum we pull just by shrinking the steam instead of replacing it with the ice-cold water

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.110
Once our microwave is finished cooking. I'll take it out pour out the water

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:04.210
I'm going to add one large marshmallow down inside it because marshmallows in a vacuum are always fun

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:09.129
And then I'm gonna put our pressure gauge on top of the bottle and lower it down into our ice water

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.110
We let it out

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.109
Fit a marshmallow in it doesn't have a lot of spare space

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.469
There we go now we get our negative pressure gauge

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:27.310
Onto our container and start lowering it down into the ice water to cool down all of the steam

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.730
Inside the bottle you can already see how much the gauge is raising

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:35.619
And if you look down into that bottle you can also see our marshmallow. It's starting to grow

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:40.900
Our marshmallow is also very soft because it's in contact with our very hot glass oh

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.480
Wow

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:52.029
We're already at 21 inches of mercury a pretty big marshmallow. It's certainly a less convenient way of making a vacuum chamber

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:56.050
Than with our actual vacuum pump, but it is working

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:03.609
All right, I think we've about hit our limit with our vacuum pump at this altitude. We can usually pull about 26

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:08.229
Maybe 26 and a half so this is pretty seriously empty

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:15.640
There is almost nothing except that marshmallow inside this jar here is an unexpected marshmallow and are

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:22.360
Heated by the glass and expanded marshmallow, you can see a pretty good sized difference there now to break the seal

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.529
I'm just gonna pull up on the rubber a little bit, and it should be able to pop right off

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:31.689
Smushed

00:06:31.689 --> 00:06:33.430
now it's just like a

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:37.919
Wrinkled melted husk of a marshmallow. There is one more thing. I'm going to try that's pretty similar

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:42.389
I'm going to wash out this marshmallow add a little bit of water nuke this thing in the microwave again

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:47.309
And once it's really hot. I'll take it out and then I'm gonna see how many of these eggs

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:52.739
I can get it to suck down into the jar as the pressure drops cooling it down in our water

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:00.719
In an effort to get our jar to pull as many eggs inside of it as we can

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:01.840
I've got a

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:06.869
PVC tube that we should be able to fit our hard-boiled eggs down into in a line when the jar is ready

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:11.519
I should be able to flip the PVC tube up put it over the neck of the jar and then lower it down into the

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:17.639
water
And hopefully as the steam cools off and it forms a vacuum inside the jar it will pull the eggs in one after another

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.579
I've never tried this before though so we'll see if it works

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:32.219
There we go we can see the eggs backed up to the pipe, I think we've got 10 eggs in this PVC pipe

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:36.538
Hopefully we can get 10 eggs sucked down into our jar

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:52.910
I

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:03.510
Think let me like the last one

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:11.249
That's it. That's it well. Good news and bad news bad news is we shattered our jar

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:16.440
The thermal shock I guess it was so hot and then being dropped into the ice water

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.529
that just broke it right up, but

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.440
Before it completely fell apart

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:25.230
We had enough low pressure

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:30.060
To pull 10 eggs through our tube into the jar that was pretty entertaining

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:33.150
That worked great

00:08:35.979 --> 00:08:37.979
But that's never been done before

00:08:38.410 --> 00:08:42.719
creating vacuum inside of a glass jar with a couple unorthodox methods

00:08:42.719 --> 00:08:46.469
We were able to drop a piece of burning paper towel down inside and with our vacuum gauge

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:49.860
We saw that we pulled about 4 inches of mercury which isn't a ton?

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:53.070
But it was enough that we were able to lift the jar with it that low pressure

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:56.640
Also had enough strength to suck a hard-boiled egg down inside of our jar

00:08:56.710 --> 00:09:01.229
Which was entertaining to get back out using a little bit of liquid nitrogen poured in behind the egg?

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:07.800
We also used boiling water and steam and then cooled it off in ice water to get the change in volume from the steam being

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.080
Fully expanded to contracting down a lot

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:14.999
We were able to get a lot of low pressure using that method we pulled almost 25 inches of mercury

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:20.819
Just by cooling our jar down in some iced water. That's not a full vacuum, but it is very low pressure

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:26.789
I thought it was very entertaining taking our jar full of hot steam lowering it down into some ice water with a tube of eggs

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:31.980
Above it and they all just got sucked down into it. It was really interesting. I love that noise it just

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:34.720
Pulling him down in

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:41.760
We did unfortunately have our jar shatter as a result of the change in temperature from the boiling heat to the ice-cold water

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:46.349
So unfortunately we were not able to pour liquid nitrogen into the whole jar full 10 eggs

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:49.530
Turn upside down and have it just shoot them all back out which is something

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:54.959
I wanted to do and we might have to try that again in the future eggs are cheap steam. Is cheap overall

00:09:55.060 --> 00:10:00.390
It's a really cool experiment that shows what kinds of vacuum pressure you can get without owning vacuum pump

00:10:01.459 --> 00:10:03.759
