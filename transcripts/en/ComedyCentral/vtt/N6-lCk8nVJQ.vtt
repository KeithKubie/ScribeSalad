- Okay people.

00:00:03.235 --> 00:00:05.571
The school board
is making us discuss

00:00:05.604 --> 00:00:07.807
the dangers
of drugs with you.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.176 align:start position:0%
Two cops are here
to talk about it.

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:13.146 align:start position:0%
Listen, don't listen,
I don't give a shit.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:15.148
[inhales deeply]
Mmm.

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:16.983 align:end position:100%
- So you little kids
like drugs?

00:00:17.016 --> 00:00:18.918
[cheering]
- Who doesn't?

00:00:18.951 --> 00:00:21.254 align:start position:0%
- You think a little puff-puff,
snort-snort's cool, huh?

00:00:21.287 --> 00:00:22.688
Sound like fun?
[cheering]

00:00:22.721 --> 00:00:24.257 size:84% position:58%
- Yeah, I'm high right now.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:25.992 align:start position:0%

how you feel about drugs

00:00:26.025 --> 00:00:27.193 align:start position:0%
after this slide show.

00:00:27.226 --> 00:00:29.062

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:33.499 align:end position:100%
- This is Timothy.
Handsome, innocent, smart.

00:00:33.532 --> 00:00:35.034 align:start size:44% position:56%
Only half Jew.

00:00:35.067 --> 00:00:36.769 align:end position:100%
He was on his way
to Harvard Business School

00:00:36.802 --> 00:00:37.770 align:start size:69% position:31%
on a full scholarship.

00:00:37.803 --> 00:00:40.173 size:75% position:38%
- Until he met JaMarcus.

00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:42.708 align:start position:0%
JaMarcus introduced
Timothy to marijuana.

00:00:42.741 --> 00:00:44.877 align:start position:0%
Now Timothy is
a fat, blimp loser

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.246 align:start position:0%
who can't see his feet
and smells like Funyons.

00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:48.781
- Legend.

00:00:48.814 --> 00:00:50.416 align:start size:72% position:28%
- This is Chang Chu Lu.

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:51.884 align:start size:72% position:28%
Honorable, disciplined,

00:00:51.917 --> 00:00:53.453 align:end position:100%
and we're assuming,
excellent at math.

00:00:53.486 --> 00:00:55.755 size:75% position:38%
- Until he met JaMarcus.

00:00:55.788 --> 00:00:58.291 align:start position:0%
- Damn, JaMarcus out here
slingin' like the boy Marlo.

00:00:58.324 --> 00:01:00.359 align:start position:0%
- It only took
one snort of nose candy

00:01:00.392 --> 00:01:02.462 align:start position:0%
before Chang
believed he could fly.

00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:04.664
He couldn't.
- Oh, snap!

00:01:04.697 --> 00:01:06.666
- Last and least,
meet Darryl.

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:09.302
Darryl was an honor student
and star of his football team,

00:01:09.335 --> 00:01:11.637 align:end position:100%
who surprisingly had
no illegitimate children

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.073
or police record.
- Until he met...

00:01:14.106 --> 00:01:15.508
all: JaMarcus!

00:01:15.541 --> 00:01:17.410
- JaMarcus gave Darryl molly.

00:01:17.443 --> 00:01:18.711 size:81% position:41%
It's a popular party drug,

00:01:18.744 --> 00:01:20.680 align:start position:0%
known to help kids
lose their inhibitions.

00:01:20.713 --> 00:01:22.181
[cheering]

00:01:22.214 --> 00:01:23.249
- Yeah, get it Darryl.

00:01:23.282 --> 00:01:24.417 align:start position:0%
- Darryl caught AIDS.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.418
- Ooh.
- Oh.

00:01:25.451 --> 00:01:26.719
- Not the Magic Johnson kind,

00:01:26.752 --> 00:01:28.554 align:start position:0%
the full-blown,
Matthew McConaughey

00:01:28.587 --> 00:01:30.022
in "Dallas Buyers Club" kind.

00:01:30.055 --> 00:01:31.190
- Nigga what?

00:01:31.223 --> 00:01:32.358 align:start position:0%
- So kids,
if somebody

00:01:32.391 --> 00:01:34.360 align:start position:0%
offers you drugs,
just say no.

00:01:34.393 --> 00:01:36.829
- Man, don't nobody
have to offer us drugs.

00:01:36.862 --> 00:01:38.498
We already got them shits.

00:01:38.531 --> 00:01:40.066 align:end position:100%
- You don't got
them shits anymore.

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:41.567 align:end position:100%
We raided your lockers
this morning.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.603 align:end position:100%
As of right now,
Chamberlain Heights

00:01:43.636 --> 00:01:45.605 align:end position:100%
is drier than
your teacher's clam.

00:01:45.638 --> 00:01:47.073
[class groaning]

00:01:47.106 --> 00:01:48.772 line:92%
