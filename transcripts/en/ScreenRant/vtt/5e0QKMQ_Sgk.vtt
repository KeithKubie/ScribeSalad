00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:08.250
Becoming a Hollywood star is hard, but maintaining
the success is even harder.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.740
From former child stars, to one hit wonders,
to total has-beens there are tons of stories

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.340
of actors and actresses falling from grace
without much notice.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:22.580
We are taking a look at some of the most interesting
cases for our list of 10 Popular Actors Who

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.269
Vanished Out Of Nowhere!

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.079
Jack Gleeson
Jack Gleeson is much better known as King

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.820
Joffrey from Game Of Thrones AKA the most
hated TV villain in recent memory.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.379
Gleeson was so good in the role that the entire
world truly despised him and when his character

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.399
was killed off, fans rejoiced.

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:56.320
While this is actually a testament to Gleeson’s
acting ability, it may have proved too much

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.970
for the young actor to handle as he decided
that Hollywood was not for him.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.149
Gleeson returned to school and is now finishing
up his graduate degree.

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.350
There is no telling if he will return to the
spotlight any time, but for now he is just

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:14.140
another example of an actor vanishing from
Hollywood.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.830
Jack Nicholson
Jack Nicholson is one of the most respected

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.020
actors still alive and his body of work is
as diverse as it is impressive.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.330
Nicholson has been nominated and awarded for
decades for movies like The Shining, The Departed…Oh,

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:26.890
and he was The Joker too!

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.310
Lately, we haven’t seen much form Jacky
and the reason why is actually quite sad.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.190
It was reported that Nicholson has stopped
acting because in 2013 he began to realize

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.760
that he was no longer able to remember his
lines.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.060
It’s very tough to see such an amazing talent
pulled out of the industry for this reason

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:49.390
and we will always cherish the great performances
that Nicholson has given us!

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.420
Macauley Culkin
These days we feel bad for Macaulay Culkin

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.300
as the only place his names seems to be showing
up is in lists of child actors who aged terribly.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.310
Culkin was absolutely amazing in the Home
Alone franchise and it truly seemed like he

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.320
was going to turn that young success into
a great career.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.920
Unfortunately, like so many others like him,
he got swept up in the fame, money and drugs

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.470
and vanished from Hollywood.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.480
Culkin is still remembered fondly by many
so perhaps there is a chance for redemption

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.490
for him, but we doubt it.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.740
Amanda Bynes
Amanda Bynes is one of the saddest stories

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.180
of a promising young actor fading into obscurity.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.560
As a teenager, Bynes was electric on her variety
show The Amanda Show and in movies like She’s

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.060
The Man and Hairspray but since then she really
hasn’t done much.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.590
A few years back, she began publically ranting
on Twitter and it came to light that Amanda

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.630
Bynes lives with some pretty challenging mental
illnesses.

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.060
These illnesses often begin to emerge in people’s
early twenties so it makes perfect sense when

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.590
and why Amanda Bynes disappeared from Hollywood
at exactly that time.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.010
We wish all the best for Bynes and hope she
has a successful comeback if she ever wants

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.010
one.

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.100
Daniel Day-Lewis
Daniel Day-Lewis is one of the most talented

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.830
and awarded actors of our generation.

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.930
He doesn’t seem to make a bad movie, but
maybe that is because he really doesn’t

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.000
make that many films.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.370
DDL is famous for completely disappearing
from Hollywood between his roles, for example

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.770
he has not been in a movie since he played
the titular role in 2012’s Lincoln.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.850
We are guessing that he is just a very picky
guy who only wants to do certain films, but

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.430
it’s definitely uncommon for an actor to
follow up an Oscar winning performance with

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.760
a 5-year drought.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.630
Daniel Day-Lewis will be appearing in an untitled
2017 film directed by Paul Thomas Anderson,

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.110
the guy who made There Will Be Blood.

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.870
Johnny Depp
While Johnny Depp hasn’t completely disappeared

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.520
from movies (yet), he seems to have disappeared
from good movies over the last few years.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.959
Depp used to be one of the most respected
working actors and was credited with being

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.550
able to completely transform into any role.

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.720
It seems like he may have lost his mojo as
he has been pumped boring, disappointing and

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.990
even creepy performances for years now.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:52.980
From Willy Wonka to The Tourist to Black Mass,
the actor seems to keep missing the mark.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.640
We’re fans of Depp and we are still hopeful
that he will be able to return to form and

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.210
turn in a few more great performances.

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.900
Jared Leto
Everyone knows that Jared Leto will be playing

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.470
The Joker for years to come in the DCEU but
did you know that there was a time when the

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.850
actor actually vanished from Hollywood.

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.120
In the early 2000’s the actors played some
amazing roles in movies like American Psycho

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.280
and Requiem for a Dream but then in 2009 the
actor seemingly vanished.

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.819
Where did he go?

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:24.230
Well Jared Leto was actually focusing his
time and energy on his band 30 Seconds To

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.620
Mars during those years and they achieved
some pretty big success.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.970
In 2013, Leto reappeared in impressive fashion
taking home the Academy Award for Best Supporting

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:38.740
Actor in Dallas Buyers Club, pretty impressive
for his first role back in Hollywood.

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.220
Tara Reid
Things were a lot different back in 1999,

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.850
people were worried about Y2K, TLC had the
number one song in the world and Tara Reid

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.460
was a relevant actor.

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.820
Reid started in the teen comedy American Pie
and with her looks and talents it seemed like

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.660
her career was headed for stardom.

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.720
Unfortunately for her, it never really panned
out and she has been constantly struggling

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.440
to appear in even the most insignificant roles.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.470
You know your acting career is in big trouble
when your most notable role in the last ten

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:14.250
years comes in 2013’s Sharknado.

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.070
Ralph Macchino
Quick, who plays The Karate Kid?

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:22.520
If you said Jaden Smith, you are probably
younger than us and might not know that the

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.680
original Karate Kid from the 1984 film was
actually played by Ralph Macchino.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.950
Ralph was amazing in the role and everyone
predicted that his career would skyrocket.

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:35.030
Unfortunately, Macchino is just one on the
long list of child actors whose careers have

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:36.780
tanked after their early success.

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:41.540
Over the years Macchino has made the odd appearance
in obscure shows and movies, but nothing really

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:42.540
notable.

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.340
For some funny moments of people making fun
of Ralph Macchino’s career, check out the

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.710
2016 Comedy Central Roast of Rob Lowe.

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.520
Lindsay Lohan
Every time Lindsay Lohan attempted to make

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.340
a comeback to the Hollywood Spotlight, it
goes poorly.

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.680
It’s too bad because as a young actor she
was really great in movies like The Parent

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.030
Trap, Freaky Friday and Mean Girls.

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:06.170
Lohan has famously gotten into a lot of trouble
with the law and the once beautiful actress

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:08.120
is definitely looking worse these days.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.110
We’re not completely ruling out a comeback
for Lohan, but until she figures things out

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.639
a little better with herself, we think its
bet that she stays vanished.

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:20.020
So there’s our list of 10 popular actors
who totally vanished from Hollywood out of

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.020
nowhere.
