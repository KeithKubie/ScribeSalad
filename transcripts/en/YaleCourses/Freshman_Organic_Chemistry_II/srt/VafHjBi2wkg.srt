1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,300
Okay.
I want to start with a,

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,440
with a question that was
asked by [inaudible] after
the last lecture regarding

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,510
fractional order kinetics.
Uh,

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,720
you remember that in the
reaction of methyl lithium,

5
00:00:15,721 --> 00:00:20,721
there was a pre equilibrium between
the tetramer and the and the monomer.

6
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:25,200
So the tetramer is dominant,
but the monomer is reactive.

7
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,790
So remember what that meant was that
at an equal, in this pre equilibrium,

8
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:32,730
the rate of association equals
the rate of dissociation.

9
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,120
So the concentration of monomer to the
fourth power is proportional to that of

10
00:00:38,221 --> 00:00:42,570
the tetramer. Or if you take the,
the fourth routes on each side,

11
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,340
it says that the concentration
of the, of the, uh,

12
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:51,830
reactive species is one fourth power in
the amount of material you actually add,

13
00:00:52,891 --> 00:00:55,790
which is the dominant tetramer.
But why each,

14
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:59,520
what Aisha pointed out is this seemed
to be similar to the case of a radical

15
00:00:59,521 --> 00:01:02,970
chain initiator, which also had
a fractional order. Remember,

16
00:01:02,971 --> 00:01:07,500
the idea was that the initiator,
uh, breaks to give to radicals.

17
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:12,720
Then the radical abstracts a hydrogen to
give the radical, which is part of the,

18
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,470
uh, cycling mechanism in
the, in the radical chain.

19
00:01:16,471 --> 00:01:19,890
The propagation steps of
the free radical reaction,

20
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,080
but ultimately that the machines are
destroyed by two radicals getting together

21
00:01:25,081 --> 00:01:26,790
in the termination process,

22
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,410
either forming xx or x
with our or our with our,

23
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:36,360
so at first glance, this doesn't look very
similar to the equilibrium on the top.

24
00:01:36,361 --> 00:01:39,210
This isn't an equilibrium at all,
right?

25
00:01:39,211 --> 00:01:41,070
You're not going back to
the starting material,

26
00:01:41,071 --> 00:01:45,620
you're not getting back to the
peroxide. So this one was, was uh,

27
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:50,940
uh, is an example of a steady
state instead of an equilibrium.

28
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,030
So when the machine gets,
when the,

29
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,100
the initiation is constantly going on,

30
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:01,020
the machine gets into a steady state
of how fast it's going around and

31
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:05,760
disappearing at the same time.
Then then you have the,

32
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,030
the amount of termination
equals the amount of initiation.

33
00:02:09,031 --> 00:02:11,040
So you have a steady amount of this,

34
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:14,280
which is going to determine the
rate of the reaction of the machine.

35
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,510
And since the termination is proportional
to the concentration of radical

36
00:02:18,511 --> 00:02:23,490
squared, it could be, it could be the
radical could be in the form either of x,

37
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,270
Adam or in the form of the are radical.

38
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:31,080
But whatever it is that when two
of them get together, that does it.

39
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:34,140
So the radicals concentration squared,

40
00:02:34,141 --> 00:02:38,940
how much machine there is squared is
proportional to the, to the initiation,

41
00:02:38,941 --> 00:02:43,410
to the concentration of
this. Okay. So this is,

42
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,240
this isn't an equilibrium as it was in
the top, but really it's the same deal.

43
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:52,290
The number of machines
then is proportional to the
square root of the amount of

44
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:54,120
the initiator.
Right?

45
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:58,440
And notice that this is
the same association equals
dissociation implies this

46
00:02:58,441 --> 00:03:02,620
relationship. Termination equals
initiation implies this relationship.

47
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:06,520
So really they are the same thing. Even
though when she asked me the question,

48
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:08,260
I thought they were completely different.

49
00:03:08,261 --> 00:03:11,920
So I've been teaching this for
45 years or something like that.

50
00:03:11,921 --> 00:03:15,490
And it never occurred to me that these
fundamentally where the same thing,

51
00:03:15,491 --> 00:03:18,190
the reason, the reason you have
this fractional order kinetics.

52
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:23,260
So this was a simplification
and generalization that
I Isha came up with and

53
00:03:23,261 --> 00:03:27,910
that's what constitutes progress in
science is when instead of having to

54
00:03:27,911 --> 00:03:29,500
memorize a zillion things,

55
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,650
you find out that they're all the
same and you just know that one.

56
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:37,570
So congratulations to Asia and keep
up the good work, all you people.

57
00:03:37,571 --> 00:03:41,590
That's what makes it fun to teach you.
After x years of teaching this,

58
00:03:41,591 --> 00:03:46,300
I'm still learning. Okay?
And I also ask questions.

59
00:03:46,301 --> 00:03:49,340
So on the 2009 exam, I asked, uh, uh,

60
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,640
consider this chlorination reaction,

61
00:03:51,641 --> 00:03:56,440
the one we talked about at the end
of last lecture and a certain Bond

62
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,130
Association energies. And then you're
supposed to figure out various things.

63
00:04:00,131 --> 00:04:02,170
But part g of this many part,

64
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:07,350
a question was why should the bond
association energies of NCL and RCL be so

65
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:14,620
different when those of
Nh and rh are so similar?

66
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,900
So NCL is 46,
and h is 92,

67
00:04:19,901 --> 00:04:24,901
twice as big a RCL and rh
are about the same energy.

68
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,020
Why is that?
Well,

69
00:04:29,021 --> 00:04:33,640
what I expected the answer I expected it
was based on this lone pair repulsion.

70
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:38,641
So here on the left we have
peroxide and and ethane,

71
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,090
they have the same number of electrons,
right?

72
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:47,020
And on the right we
have NCL and methyl cl,

73
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:50,140
the same number of electrons on the right.
Okay?

74
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:54,490
Now if you look at the
Bond Association energies,

75
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:57,130
this one is twice as strong as that one.

76
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,930
And this one is nearly
twice as strong as that one.

77
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:07,090
So what makes the ones on the top so
weak when really it's the same number of

78
00:05:07,091 --> 00:05:10,090
electrons involved up and down.
Okay,

79
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:14,350
well what you notice is that on top you
have lone pairs on the atoms that are

80
00:05:14,351 --> 00:05:17,830
being bonded, which will
repel one another. So the,

81
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:22,750
the Idi expected was that that would
weaken the bond. Now is this plausible?

82
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:29,950
Could the electron repair
electron pair repulsion?

83
00:05:29,951 --> 00:05:33,790
Explain the difference in Bond Association
energies between the top and bottom,

84
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:34,781
what we could look at,

85
00:05:34,781 --> 00:05:39,010
how the electrons actually are arranged
as we calculate it by quantum mechanics.

86
00:05:39,011 --> 00:05:44,011
And of course what it looks like depends
on what contour we draw this contour at

87
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,620
point double o two uh,

88
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:51,370
electrons per cubic bor radius
is not very informative.

89
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:56,640
But if we go in further to
higher densities to 0.01 to 0.05,

90
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,540
2.25,

91
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:03,250
now we see something different in
these two things you'd noticed.

92
00:06:03,251 --> 00:06:07,130
That's what that, uh,
in the, in the bottom,

93
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,980
the protons that are out here,

94
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:13,990
the Proton on the carbon as opposed to
where there is no proton on the oxygen

95
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:19,170
draws these electrons out. Right.
And the same thing here, the,

96
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:23,870
the hydrogen that's pulled out of the
nitrogen nucleus and put out here to

97
00:06:23,871 --> 00:06:28,871
become ch three that draws these
electrons out so that they don't repel one

98
00:06:28,881 --> 00:06:32,210
another as much. So, uh, uh,

99
00:06:32,211 --> 00:06:36,140
that seems a plausible explanation,
although it's not quantitative.

100
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,940
Okay. So we would say then that the
repulsion between the electrons,

101
00:06:40,941 --> 00:06:43,970
which is less in the case
where they've been drawn out,

102
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,870
might be an important factor in,

103
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,170
in stabilizing the ones where
the electrons are drawn out.

104
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,260
That was the answer I
expected on the exam.

105
00:06:54,261 --> 00:06:57,710
Cause we had talked about
lone pair repulsion, right.

106
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:01,400
So that seems a plausible
explanation for weakening.

107
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:05,750
Oh versus cc or NCL versus CCL.

108
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,950
But that wasn't the answer I got on a
lot of the, some people gave that answer,

109
00:07:09,951 --> 00:07:14,660
but a lot of them appealed to then that
difference of electronegativity so that

110
00:07:14,661 --> 00:07:19,661
CCL has a big difference in
electronegativity according
to the polling scale of

111
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,890
electronegativity.

112
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,160
So carbon has 2.55 chlorine 3.16
they're quite different in their

113
00:07:28,101 --> 00:07:33,101
electronegativity whereas nitrogen
3.04 is rather similar to the 3.16.

114
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:38,420
So that was what people had in mind then
was there'd be an important resonance

115
00:07:38,421 --> 00:07:43,250
structure for CCL. That would be c
plus cl minus. And that would be,

116
00:07:43,251 --> 00:07:47,600
we know, we associate the existence of
resonance structures with stabilization.

117
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:48,710
Uh,

118
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:53,360
now we've seen that we can understand
that thing in terms of the,

119
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:58,400
the energies of orbitals that the
concept that was involved there. Uh,

120
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:03,170
we, we start with a, with a bond
either with nitrogen to chlorine,

121
00:08:03,171 --> 00:08:05,780
which would have its electrons.
There are carbon to chlorine,

122
00:08:05,781 --> 00:08:07,700
which would have its electrons down there.

123
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:11,450
And then if we're going to break the bond,
those electrons,

124
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:16,540
if we're going to go to ions like end
plus or c plus and cl minus these electron

125
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:22,490
pairs would have to go onto the chlorine
and they have to go farther when

126
00:08:22,491 --> 00:08:23,540
they're on the nitrogen.

127
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:29,050
So that mismatch and energies aids
breaking them Hetero literally for the,

128
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:35,210
uh, for the carbon for case
where the carbon is mismatched,

129
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,540
you don't have to go up as much.
So it's easier to ionize,

130
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,950
but that's not what we're talking
about in bond association energy.

131
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,140
In Bond Association energy,

132
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:49,400
we're talking about breaking to two free
radicals where one goes on, one Adam,

133
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:54,020
one electron goes on the other from the
payer. And now as we talked about, uh,

134
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:59,230
early last semester in terms of bond
association energy or Homolysis,

135
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,780
it's the carbon chlorine bond is stronger,
right?

136
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:08,810
So this is putting a slightly
more quantitative stuff,

137
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:14,640
uh, ideas to bear on the
idea of why, uh, the,

138
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:18,510
you have that difference in bond strength,
but the idea of,

139
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:23,520
of electronegativity being associated
with bond strength is an interesting one

140
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,530
that's worth tracing down a little bit.

141
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:30,660
So I'm going to talk just a little bit
today about electronegativity and bond

142
00:09:30,661 --> 00:09:35,640
strengths. Uh, the first
few, as I've mentioned this
last semester in English, uh,

143
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,080
of, uh, of, uh,

144
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:42,530
of the word electronegativity was in
1837 and systems of mineralogy by James

145
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,540
Dwight Dana.
And we mentioned that James Might,

146
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:49,980
Dana was a professor
here at Yale, uh, in the,

147
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:54,080
in the 19th century. Uh, he, uh,

148
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:56,500
lived in this House that, that, uh,

149
00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:01,550
you've walked by and which is now
a national historical monument.

150
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,070
And he lived in the house with his wife,
Henrietta Dana.

151
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:08,910
Actually it was Henry at a Silliman.
Dana was her,

152
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:14,180
was her maiden name and she
was the daughter of Benjamin
Solomon whose statue is

153
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:17,970
just down past Nate out there on the,

154
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,120
as you see them on the way up I think is,

155
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:26,070
is a snow necklace has
gone this week. Okay. So,

156
00:10:26,071 --> 00:10:28,020
uh, Dana was well married. Okay.

157
00:10:28,021 --> 00:10:31,460
That's just to give you a
little local color on the bay,

158
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:36,200
but electronegativity in the sense
we use it. Uh, what, what, what puts,

159
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,240
what sense with Dana have been
involved in electronegativity in 1837,

160
00:10:41,431 --> 00:10:43,170
what idea was going around that,

161
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:48,360
where the negativity or positivity
of Adams would be important?

162
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:53,640
Dualism, right? Right. The idea
of what held things together,

163
00:10:53,641 --> 00:10:56,790
he thought if you could understand what
was negative and what was positive,

164
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:58,830
then you could understand
minerals in that case.

165
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:03,180
But electronegativity in the sense of
organic chemistry or Inorganic Chemistry

166
00:11:03,181 --> 00:11:08,181
for that matter was popularized by Linus
Pauling beginning with this paper in,

167
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:13,090
uh, in, uh, 1933, uh,

168
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,990
or 1932, it was published. Okay?

169
00:11:15,991 --> 00:11:19,290
So this is the key passage in that paper.

170
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:23,280
And remember that Pauling was
pushing this idea of resonance,

171
00:11:23,281 --> 00:11:27,540
that you get stabilization when you can
draw different resonance structures.

172
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:33,020
So he's talking about the attitude of
the energies of normal covalent bonds.

173
00:11:33,301 --> 00:11:38,301
He says there's empirical evidence in
support of the postulate that the energies

174
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:43,470
of normal covalent bonds are additive.
Now what does he mean by additive?

175
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,780
That is that if you have Adam's a and B,
you could have a,

176
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:53,770
you could have a baby and a
baby and you could have a B.

177
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:59,140
And his idea is that the bond strength
and a B should be the average of what you

178
00:11:59,141 --> 00:12:01,660
have in Aa and what you have in BB.

179
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:07,410
So he was a little confusing about that
because in some papers he used this

180
00:12:07,871 --> 00:12:10,270
concept using the arithmetic mean,

181
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:14,470
but in others he talked about
the geometric mean where
it was the square root of

182
00:12:14,471 --> 00:12:19,180
the product instead of the half
the sum. Okay. But at any rate,

183
00:12:19,181 --> 00:12:24,181
the idea was that normal covalent bonds
should be the average of the whole of

184
00:12:25,031 --> 00:12:28,840
the homo nuclear bonds.
So he uses them this,

185
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:32,680
this plot where he's measuring
the energies of the bonds,

186
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:37,780
Bond Association, energies in
unusual units for us electron volts,

187
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:42,520
right? It's you multiply by 23 to
get kilocalories per mole. Okay.

188
00:12:42,521 --> 00:12:45,940
So here are our HX bonds that are normal,

189
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:49,290
that that is calculated
if they were normal there.

190
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:54,300
The average of the HH and the xx for the
different halogens as you see fluorine,

191
00:12:54,491 --> 00:12:58,990
chlorine, bromine, and
item. Okay. But the actual,

192
00:12:59,260 --> 00:12:59,981
uh,
now,

193
00:12:59,981 --> 00:13:04,420
incidentally there's a little problem
here because he was using the wrong value

194
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:07,810
for the fluorine, fluorine bond
energy, and all of this work.

195
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:12,760
He thought it was 65 kilocalories from
all. Actually it's 38. It's a very,

196
00:13:12,761 --> 00:13:16,690
it's a rather weak bond because of all
these electron pair repulsions that we

197
00:13:16,691 --> 00:13:21,670
talked about. Okay. So his
numbers are a little bit skewed,

198
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,910
but then he rate that was
what he was doing. But now,

199
00:13:24,911 --> 00:13:28,660
so this is theoretical all
to get these red numbers.

200
00:13:28,661 --> 00:13:32,650
He used hh and x ax and just
took their average. Okay.

201
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:36,040
Now observed values are this,

202
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:39,040
the bonds are actually
stronger than you expect,

203
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,580
but they're not all stronger
by the same amount, right?

204
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,720
So you can look in Paul,
and the reason is in Pauling's theory,

205
00:13:46,721 --> 00:13:50,590
this residence theory that you can
have the polar resonance structure,

206
00:13:50,591 --> 00:13:53,590
which makes it more
stable and now you can,

207
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:58,330
what this suggests is that there's this
difference Delta between what you would

208
00:13:58,331 --> 00:14:01,960
expect if it were normal, the
average, and what you observed,

209
00:14:01,961 --> 00:14:05,200
which is what you have when you
have this polar resonance structure.

210
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:09,190
And what he says here, the greater
the ionic character of the bond,

211
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:13,060
the greater will be the value of Delta.
Okay?

212
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:17,140
So the need idea now
is we could use delta,

213
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:22,590
which is x based on experimental numbers
as a way to measure how important

214
00:14:23,051 --> 00:14:25,600
resonance is,
right?

215
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:31,380
So you could measure resonance
stabilization by Delta if you follow,

216
00:14:32,141 --> 00:14:36,550
if you adopt his assumptions that
normal bonds are the average,

217
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,640
right? And now you've measure these
and then you get the difference,

218
00:14:39,641 --> 00:14:42,490
tells you how important
resonance stabilization is.

219
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:47,530
And then you try to see if
there's something you can
correlate to predict how,

220
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:51,860
how important resonance
stabilization should be. All right?

221
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:55,820
So he has this rather complicated
table two in the paper,

222
00:14:56,090 --> 00:15:00,200
which has observed bond energies,
normal bond energies,

223
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:04,520
Delta and the square root of Delta.
Okay?

224
00:15:04,521 --> 00:15:08,030
Now let's show how that works by
taking one particular block here.

225
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:11,990
So we're comparing oxygen and fluorine,
okay?

226
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:17,570
So here on the table we look at oxygen,
oxygen, and it's Bond Association.

227
00:15:17,571 --> 00:15:21,110
Energy is 1.49 electron volts,
okay?

228
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:23,540
Or you can look over here and fluorine.

229
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:28,100
Fluorine is 2.8 so if
the bond were normal,

230
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:33,530
the oxygen fluorine bond would be the
average of those, right? Which is,

231
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:38,890
although remember actually this is 1.65
it's not 2.8 but put that aside for now.

232
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,600
Okay. Now then, if you look
at oxygen with fluorine,

233
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:49,900
the Bond Association energy observed
as 2.48 now we can compare that,

234
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,330
uh,
it's,

235
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,360
notice it's not the average
of 1.49 and 2.8 it's too high,

236
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:03,530
right? So we could calculate
what the normal would be,

237
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:06,500
what the average is of o and f,

238
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:09,680
F and then we can take the difference.

239
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:13,280
The difference is 0.33 that's delta.

240
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:16,730
That's how much in his view,
the,

241
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:21,850
the olf bond has been stabilized
because of the resonance structure.

242
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:27,440
Okay? Now, is there a way to predict
how big that Delta should be?

243
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:32,450
Well, here's the same deal
with carbon and fluorine.

244
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:37,790
And notice that the Delta for carbon
and fluorine is 2.2 much bigger than

245
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:39,440
between oxygen and fluorine,

246
00:16:39,441 --> 00:16:44,441
which was only 0.33 or you could look
in a different block and see what it is

247
00:16:44,811 --> 00:16:46,040
for carbon and oxygen.

248
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:50,690
It's 1.0 so we know carbon to oxygen,
how much it is,

249
00:16:50,691 --> 00:16:52,910
we know carbon to flury
and how much it is.

250
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:56,420
And we know oxygen to flury how big it is.

251
00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:00,590
Is there some relationship among these
that we could have? Knowing two of them,

252
00:17:00,591 --> 00:17:02,030
we could have predicted the third,

253
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:07,660
well not really because the difference
between CNF and the difference minus the

254
00:17:08,721 --> 00:17:13,520
difference between CNO is not the
difference between ONF. It doesn't work.

255
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:17,060
You can't add up the polarity
differences that way.

256
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:22,340
But then he tried something else.
He tried taking the square root of Delta.

257
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,590
That's the brown numbers here.

258
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:28,070
So this is the square root
of those stabilizations.

259
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:33,280
And now you see something interesting
that the difference between c,

260
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:34,070
uh,

261
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:39,070
between CEO and CF is the
difference between o and F.

262
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:41,540
Pretty close,
right?

263
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:45,500
So it's about the square
roots are about additive. Now,

264
00:17:45,501 --> 00:17:50,501
I don't think he had any good reason to
theoretically say say it should be the

265
00:17:50,551 --> 00:17:54,120
square root, but he fiddled with the
numbers that he noticed that worked.

266
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,750
So the question is, does it work
for all the elements? If so,

267
00:18:00,751 --> 00:18:05,010
then from something you can
predict the others. Okay,

268
00:18:05,011 --> 00:18:07,050
so here he has the here's he has those,

269
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:12,000
the square roots of Delta for
carbon versus other things. That is,

270
00:18:12,001 --> 00:18:15,390
how important is the resonance structure,

271
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,390
the square root of the
stabilization of the bond. How?

272
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:24,360
How important is that for ch four CN,

273
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:27,960
for CEO, for CF, for CECL, for CBR.

274
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:33,380
And can we use that to establish a scale
of how different the polarities are

275
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:36,720
among those different atoms?
Okay,

276
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:41,640
so here he has carbon and
here's hydrogen on one side,

277
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:46,200
then bromine, chlorine and
nitrogen, oxygen and fluorine.

278
00:18:46,201 --> 00:18:47,940
On the other side,
the distances,

279
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:51,330
there are those numbers we
just saw on the previous slide.

280
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:56,220
How important in after taking the
square root is that energy difference?

281
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,780
That stabilization. Okay, so
he did it with carbon. Now,

282
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:05,370
Eh, so you get some values. But
if those values are fundamental,

283
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:09,780
then you should get the same scale.
No matter what Adam you use.

284
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:11,700
You don't have to do carbon acts.

285
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:16,140
You could do nitrogen x or oxygen x or
anything else acts and you should always

286
00:19:16,141 --> 00:19:19,110
get the same scale if the
system is going to work.

287
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:23,640
So that's these other horizontal lines.
Noticed that in the case of carbon,

288
00:19:23,641 --> 00:19:27,570
the difference between carbon and oxygen
is one the difference between carbon

289
00:19:27,571 --> 00:19:32,571
and fluorine is 1.48 and
then the difference between
oxygen and fluorine is 0.48

290
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:38,430
and experimentally, if you measure
relative to oxygen, oxygen to flu,

291
00:19:38,431 --> 00:19:41,640
Rita's 0.58 not bad.
Okay,

292
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:46,230
so here are the others compared
to oxygen for the o x bonds.

293
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,950
And here they are relative to hydrogen,
right?

294
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:54,690
And notice that as you come down with
oxygen, fluorine, chlorine, nitrogen,

295
00:19:54,691 --> 00:19:58,110
bromine, carbon, they're
sort of the same, right?

296
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:00,120
It's the same order and
they're about the same.

297
00:20:00,121 --> 00:20:02,790
So this isn't the last word in theory,

298
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,280
but it looks like something
pretty fundamental.

299
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:10,650
And then here he used relative to
both h on one end and f on the other.

300
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,720
So he called these things
the scale electronegativity.

301
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:20,850
And here he gives the
increasing electronegativity,
which is just those numbers,

302
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:25,650
the square root of the stabilization of
the bond right from the previous slide.

303
00:20:25,651 --> 00:20:28,980
And here are the values for hydrogen,
phosphorus, iron and sulfur,

304
00:20:28,981 --> 00:20:29,820
carbon and so on.

305
00:20:29,821 --> 00:20:34,821
And these were the days when they still
did handwritten figures in the Journal

306
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:38,310
of the American Chemical Society,
which was a long time ago. Okay.

307
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:42,330
And then below that he looks at,
it's Matt,

308
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,000
I couldn't figure out for a long
time what the heck this was.

309
00:20:45,001 --> 00:20:48,040
But finally I figured out, he
doesn't say in the paper, but

310
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,050
it's a picture of the periodic table,

311
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,940
which has been distorted so that
it shows every atom at its proper

312
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:59,910
electronegativity. So here
are the halogens here, the
cow Kaja, nides, nitrogen,

313
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,870
phosphorous, carbon and
so on. In other words,

314
00:21:01,871 --> 00:21:06,871
he's taken the periodic table and he's
distorted that like that so that the

315
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:11,770
numbers go from red to yellow as
you go from left to right. Okay.

316
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,910
So that's where electronegativity
and the current sense,

317
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:19,870
the Pauling scale of electro negativity,
that's where it came from.

318
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:21,910
Okay.

319
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:26,680
And notice that what it really depends
on is what the periodic table depends on

320
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,720
is that as you go across here,

321
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,960
you have how the nuclear charge is
increasing the screened nuclear charge.

322
00:21:34,031 --> 00:21:37,120
We talked about that last semester.
And as you go down,

323
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:40,810
the number of nodes in the
valence shell is increasing.

324
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:43,420
That's what gives the
periodic table it's character.

325
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:47,830
That's what explains electronegativity.
Okay.

326
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:53,020
So the idea of this was to push the
idea of the, the concept of resonance.

327
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:58,380
Now is it surprising that we find that
bond strength correlates with differences

328
00:21:59,681 --> 00:22:01,480
in Pauline's electro negativities?

329
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:06,160
Remember that's how the Chi sub P is
Pauline's electronegativity values.

330
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,770
Remember how we got into this question?
We said,

331
00:22:08,771 --> 00:22:13,390
why are these polar bonds like
NCL unusually weak compared to,

332
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:18,340
to uh, to, uh, to, to bonds
that don't have that difference
in electro negativity.

333
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,920
And we said it was
repulsion of electron pairs,

334
00:22:20,921 --> 00:22:24,220
but some people said it's
electronegativity. Now I asked you,

335
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:29,230
is it surprising here that bond
strength correlates with Pauling's

336
00:22:29,231 --> 00:22:33,640
electronegativity scale?
Does anybody got a,

337
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:36,983
you have an opinion on

338
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:40,910
that after what I had been saying,
I've gone through this pretty fast,

339
00:22:40,911 --> 00:22:43,220
so I don't expect expect you to,

340
00:22:43,221 --> 00:22:46,730
but I was impressed by the question
I got after the last lecture,

341
00:22:46,731 --> 00:22:49,730
so I thought I'd give it a try here.
Yeah,

342
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,430
yeah.
No,

343
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:59,600
because that's where the electro
negativities came from in Pawling.

344
00:22:59,601 --> 00:23:02,780
He used the bond there member, it's
the square root of the, of the,

345
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:07,470
of the bond strength stabilization that
he used to get the electronegativity

346
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,830
scale. So it's not
surprising at all, Nate.

347
00:23:09,831 --> 00:23:14,831
You're exactly right that the appalling
electronegativity scale was defined by

348
00:23:14,901 --> 00:23:19,510
the differences and bond strengths
from the averages. Now, uh,

349
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:24,440
in the first issue of nature
of this week, this, this year,

350
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:28,460
this year has been proclaimed the
international year of chemistry.

351
00:23:28,461 --> 00:23:31,550
So you're sitting in the right class here.
Uh,

352
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:35,510
so the first issue of nature
was celebrating chemistry
and they had a bunch of

353
00:23:35,511 --> 00:23:37,820
essays and one of them,
uh,

354
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:43,270
on pages 26 to 28 was by Phillip Ball
and it was called beyond the bond.

355
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,700
Have we gone moved beyond bonds now?

356
00:23:46,701 --> 00:23:49,640
Can we just use quantum mechanics
to talk about things? I remember,

357
00:23:49,641 --> 00:23:54,260
this was the question we asked at the
end of last semester, right? If Bond,

358
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:59,290
if the history of chemistry hadn't
developed the way it did in terms of bonds

359
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,010
and we just had quantum mechanics with
anybody ever have talked about bonds,

360
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:07,700
if you could just calculate
all these numbers and the,

361
00:24:07,701 --> 00:24:10,280
a little squib about this,
uh,

362
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:13,340
about this article said
more than ever before,

363
00:24:13,341 --> 00:24:17,390
new techniques show the bond
to be a convenient fiction,

364
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:22,160
albeit one that holds the field of
chemistry together, finds Phillip Ball.

365
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:29,420
But one passage in that I
thought was particularly timely,

366
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:35,350
he said by the 1960s for all Pauling's
salesmanship ammo theory was generally

367
00:24:37,611 --> 00:24:41,600
agreed to be more convenient than his
resonance theory for most purposes.

368
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:43,580
So when I was a student,

369
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:47,510
resonance theory was a really big thing
and molecular orbital theory was just

370
00:24:47,511 --> 00:24:50,390
coming on. But it's
really different now. Now,

371
00:24:50,391 --> 00:24:53,480
molecular orbital theory is
what people mostly focus on.

372
00:24:53,481 --> 00:24:58,100
And only certain communities tend
to talk about resonance, but, but,

373
00:24:58,490 --> 00:24:59,323
uh,

374
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:04,040
but elementary teaching tends
to lag behind where people are.

375
00:25:04,041 --> 00:25:08,780
So resonance is still a big thing
in AP courses, I suspect, and so on.

376
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:13,100
But at any rate,
it's not surprising really,

377
00:25:13,101 --> 00:25:16,360
that it certainly is not surprising
that it should correlate with Pauling's

378
00:25:16,361 --> 00:25:21,280
scale because that's what
he used to define it. Bond
strengths. But the idea of,

379
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:23,840
of of polar bonds being,

380
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:28,130
having high bond association energy in
terms of what we've talked about first,

381
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:32,240
how far the electrons have to go up
when you break the bond to get two free

382
00:25:32,241 --> 00:25:36,500
radicals, that's it. We expect
that the energy mismatch,

383
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,970
we'll strengthen bonds.

384
00:25:37,971 --> 00:25:42,740
So accrued correlation of appalling
electronegativity scale plotted vertically

385
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:47,480
with other measures of how tightly
electrons are held. The orbital event,

386
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,250
orbital energy,
for example,

387
00:25:49,251 --> 00:25:52,550
how much energy it takes to pull
an electron away from an Adam,

388
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:56,300
or how much energy,
uh, do you, uh, do you,

389
00:25:56,330 --> 00:26:00,170
does it take to pull an electron
away from a charged ion? Right.

390
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:04,850
Both of those things are our
measures of, of orbital energy. Uh,

391
00:26:04,851 --> 00:26:08,090
and that's what's called
Mulligan's electronegativity scale,

392
00:26:08,091 --> 00:26:11,630
which he published two
years later in 1934,

393
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:16,250
the average of ionization potential,
an electron affinity. So this,

394
00:26:16,251 --> 00:26:18,230
this one,
Mulligan was the,

395
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:22,250
was the one of the chief originators
of molecular orbital theory,

396
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:25,250
which in the middle of the
century was in real competition.

397
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:30,230
It was like a little bit like a radical
theory and type theory 100 years

398
00:26:30,231 --> 00:26:33,950
earlier, right? There was a lot
of competition between them, but,

399
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:37,310
but mulligans theory,
which has to do with orbital energy,

400
00:26:37,311 --> 00:26:41,300
we can understand and we
see that it correlates more
or less well with Pauline's

401
00:26:41,301 --> 00:26:43,320
electronegativity scale.
So fine.

402
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:46,380
So electronegativity does
have something to do with it,

403
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:50,820
but electronegativity really is
not sort of a fundamental property.

404
00:26:50,821 --> 00:26:54,690
It was measured in terms of
these bond stabilizations. Okay.

405
00:26:54,691 --> 00:26:56,130
That's a little bit of a,

406
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:59,820
of a sidelight to what we're
actually talking about.

407
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,790
The Chemistry and physics
of Al Keel Haylight is,

408
00:27:02,791 --> 00:27:07,680
we're going to talk about now a free
radical halogenation introduces a

409
00:27:07,681 --> 00:27:12,190
functional group into alkanes normal
alkanes don't have a functional group,

410
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:14,430
a unusually high homo or low Lumo.

411
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:17,670
Once you've done a free
radical reaction on those,

412
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:22,110
now you have this unusually
low Lumo sigma star.

413
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,270
So you can be in doing things with it.

414
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:28,560
So what we're going to talk about now
having talked about free radical reactions

415
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:32,130
is the ionic chemistry
involving that Sigma Star.

416
00:27:32,131 --> 00:27:34,140
So we're going to talk
about the alcohol Halides,

417
00:27:34,141 --> 00:27:35,730
which now we know how to prepare.

418
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:40,950
So these are nuclear affiliate
substitution and acidity
is much the same thing.

419
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:44,700
We mentioned this preliminarily
last semester, uh,

420
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:48,750
that so there are non bonded
interactions and salvation,

421
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:51,750
which is key for ionic reactions.

422
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:56,250
And I just noticed that all the
work I did since last night is uh,

423
00:27:56,490 --> 00:28:01,290
is not in here cause I've redone
that slide. Uh, so the question is,

424
00:28:01,291 --> 00:28:05,850
am I going to put that in here or not?
It would take about two seconds.

425
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:10,880
Well it'll take about a minute to break
here and start again with the most

426
00:28:11,311 --> 00:28:12,720
recent version,
which I can't,

427
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:16,440
I can't sacrifice all the
work I did since last night.

428
00:28:16,441 --> 00:28:20,370
I stayed up late so
I'm going to save this,

429
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,440
uh,

430
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:26,423
pardon me.

431
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:38,220
Does by the steak this morning I loaded
the PR, the version that was on the web.

432
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,570
Okay.
I've got that saved now nearly.

433
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:55,620
Oh, it's saving it over the
web. That's the problem.

434
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,310
I hadn't reckoned on that one.

435
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,760
Are there any questions
while we're pausing for this?

436
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,293
Yeah,

437
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,770
it just incidentally,

438
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:14,190
how much did you learn about
electronegativity in high school?

439
00:29:14,191 --> 00:29:17,850
Was this a big focus of your AP course?
Yeah.

440
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,680
So now you know where it came from,

441
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:24,510
came from Dana down the
hill and then Pauling. Okay,

442
00:29:24,511 --> 00:29:25,830
there we go.
Now.

443
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,310
Yeah.

444
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:32,460
Let's see. I want the other
version that's here, I think.

445
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:36,243
Yeah.

446
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:41,950
And here we are.

447
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:48,940
So I'm going to do that last slide again
cause that's where I noticed things

448
00:29:48,941 --> 00:29:53,530
were bad. Uh, so free radical halogenation
introduces a functional group,

449
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:57,160
uh, and we're gonna now be
looking at that functional group,

450
00:29:57,161 --> 00:30:00,040
that chemical and physical
properties of alcohol. Hey Lights,

451
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:03,850
which involves sigma star, the functional
group we've been able to put in.

452
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:09,210
So we have sn one reactions in which
those electrons go on to x in order to

453
00:30:09,581 --> 00:30:10,414
break the bond.

454
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:14,950
And we have those in which the
new electrons have gone into,

455
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:18,640
into sigma star in order
to help the x leave.

456
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,920
And that's the sn two reaction.

457
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:25,600
And if the Adam in the
middle is h instead of our,

458
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,690
then this same thing as acidity,
right?

459
00:30:28,691 --> 00:30:31,930
So that's why we introduced
this concept last semester.

460
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:36,310
But we're going to talk about it in more
detail in terms of reaction mechanisms

461
00:30:36,311 --> 00:30:39,430
now, okay. Now in the process,

462
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:42,820
this makes uh,
uh,

463
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:45,940
this makes ions right?

464
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:51,100
So we have to go beyond the molecules
themselves and thinking about this

465
00:30:51,101 --> 00:30:56,101
reaction because non bonded interactions
and salvation turns out to be key for

466
00:30:57,941 --> 00:31:01,300
ionic reactions. You can't just
look at the reacting species.

467
00:31:01,301 --> 00:31:02,830
You have to look at the surroundings,

468
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:06,790
which makes everything ever so
much more complicated. Okay.

469
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:10,330
Now this is Henri
Victorville and you'll uh,

470
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,660
who lived as you see in the middle
of the 19th century and you know,

471
00:31:13,661 --> 00:31:14,470
is that a lot,

472
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:19,360
the first letter of his last name because
it said that that's where they are,

473
00:31:19,361 --> 00:31:23,470
comes from. It stands for renewal because
he did a lot of thermodynamics stuff.

474
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:28,840
This, Oh, PV equals NRT is this
man. Now in 1850 he wrote a book,

475
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:30,670
the first elements of chemistry,

476
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:34,720
and there's one passage about chemical
affinity here that I think is worth

477
00:31:34,721 --> 00:31:38,500
looking at. He says, for
chemical affinity to act freely,

478
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,870
substances must be dispersed.

479
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:45,700
Now this was of course writing an 1850
this was before bonds or anything,

480
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:48,430
but they knew you don't
just mix solids together,

481
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:52,000
you have to disperse them and
you can't just grind them right?

482
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:55,990
Since dispersion by mechanical
pulverization is incomplete,

483
00:31:56,350 --> 00:32:00,220
the molecules have to touch molecules,
not just particles of stuff,

484
00:32:00,221 --> 00:32:04,720
touch particles, right? They must be
taken into the liquid or gaseous state.

485
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:10,080
Previous chemists expressed this fact
by saying corporate known arduous Niecy.

486
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:15,760
So Luta substances do not
react unless they're dissolved.

487
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,310
So this very,
this dissolution,

488
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:21,790
the fact of what's around the things
is what's going to be important and

489
00:32:21,791 --> 00:32:23,290
understanding reactions.

490
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:28,830
So the theory of organic chemistry
became manageable in the first place when

491
00:32:28,961 --> 00:32:31,690
people started studying gases,
as you remember,

492
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:36,580
because it's often possible to focus on
a simple unit with strong interactions.

493
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:41,450
That's molecules or the individual
and bonds within them or the strong

494
00:32:41,451 --> 00:32:46,340
interactions with well-defined geometries
and energies as we discussed last

495
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:46,820
semester.

496
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:51,820
And you neglect the much more numerous
and complex intermolecular interactions

497
00:32:53,061 --> 00:32:54,740
with the solvent.
Right?

498
00:32:54,741 --> 00:32:58,400
But actually we are going
to have to consider those
because we're interested not

499
00:32:58,401 --> 00:33:00,440
just in the gas phase but in solution.

500
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:04,190
So it was essential to go into the gas
phase in order to get a toe hold on

501
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:06,380
understanding chemistry
in the first place.

502
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,990
But if you want to understand
real practical chemistry,

503
00:33:08,991 --> 00:33:10,670
you have to understand solutions.

504
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:15,500
So these weak intermolecular
interactions give organic materials,

505
00:33:15,501 --> 00:33:17,960
many of their most valuable properties.

506
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,080
Most of the properties of
what's important in your,

507
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:25,550
in your bodies are not things that
involve making and breaking bonds,

508
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:29,030
but changing non bonded
interactions between things.

509
00:33:29,031 --> 00:33:31,610
And that's what we're going to be
looking at for a little while now.

510
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:35,960
So non bonded classical energies.
Okay,

511
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:39,060
now suppose you have a uh,

512
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:42,380
just cool ohms law charge,
charge interaction.

513
00:33:42,381 --> 00:33:45,520
That's where we started last semester.
That's as you know,

514
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:49,570
the only true source of
chemical potential energy. Uh,

515
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:54,290
there's gravity and physics and magnetism.
But those are, those are tiny, right?

516
00:33:54,291 --> 00:33:56,090
They're nothing compared to cool ohms law.

517
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:59,150
There's the strong force
that's for physicist,

518
00:33:59,151 --> 00:34:01,460
that's way above what we
deal with in chemistry.

519
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:04,910
The cool ohms law is where we live,
right?

520
00:34:04,911 --> 00:34:07,790
That it's proportional
to one over R as we know.

521
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,000
And the constant for the proportionality
is minus 300 332 kilocalories per mole.

522
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,210
When you,
when you use angst from units.

523
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:22,220
So this provides a very long range
attraction, right? Even when you're,

524
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:24,920
when you're three angst drums apart,

525
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:29,300
the energy is still a hundred
kilocalories per mole, right?

526
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:31,850
Actually now where should
we start with zero?

527
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:35,900
We could start with zero when they're
infinitely far away and then we use cool

528
00:34:35,901 --> 00:34:38,240
ohms law to get the energy,
how the energy goes down,

529
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:40,220
or if we're thinking of breaking the bond,

530
00:34:40,221 --> 00:34:45,221
we could start at the bond distance and
then stress or the distance between two

531
00:34:45,681 --> 00:34:49,850
ions and see how much it takes to pull
them apart a certain distance, right?

532
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:54,260
So if we start a bond is one and a half,
let's take bigger ions.

533
00:34:54,261 --> 00:34:56,270
Let's suppose there
are two Ostrom's apart.

534
00:34:56,780 --> 00:35:01,780
That means they're at a 332 over
to the energy is minus 165 okay.

535
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,380
If we go to three on extremes,

536
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:12,400
then it's minus 100 so we've gone up
and energy by about 100 kilocalories per

537
00:35:12,491 --> 00:35:16,820
mole in going from two to three Ostrom's
and we have a lot further to go on the

538
00:35:16,821 --> 00:35:17,654
way out.

539
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:21,830
This is very different from covalent
bonds where when you get to three Ostrom,

540
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,120
that's the end of the line.

541
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:27,680
So covalent bonds are typically
a hundred kilocalories per mole,

542
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,120
but you get there very quickly,
so they're very stiff, right?

543
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:35,150
You break the bond, you,
you, as you break the bond,

544
00:35:35,151 --> 00:35:39,420
you go up and energy really quickly.
Who loan doesn't go up as rapidly,

545
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:41,460
but it goes up very,
very far.

546
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:46,170
So it's long range and that's why solve
this are so important because they saw

547
00:35:46,171 --> 00:35:50,700
another molecule can be rather far
away and still influence ions where it

548
00:35:50,701 --> 00:35:55,650
wouldn't influence free
radicals. Okay? So,

549
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,840
uh, eh, but this is media.

550
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:03,930
This is a attenuated by a solvent.
If you have a dielectric constant,

551
00:36:03,931 --> 00:36:08,070
as it's called in the solvent,
that reduces the magnitude of,

552
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:12,750
of the, uh, Coolum big energy
or the Coolum Vic forests. Now,

553
00:36:12,751 --> 00:36:16,680
how big are these values
of, of, uh, epsilon?

554
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:22,320
Right? Here's some values taken
from the, from the Jones book, uh,

555
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:26,720
noticed that hexane is a factor of two.
So that'll take things from that.

556
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:30,240
Take that constant from 300
down to one 50, still quite big.

557
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:33,870
But if you go to something
like water at 78,

558
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:38,160
that cuts it way down,
right? This is about,

559
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:43,290
this is about this, into,
this is something like four,

560
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:44,160
right?

561
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:49,160
So it's only four kilocalories per mole
rather than 332 kilocalories per mole.

562
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:55,100
If you're operating in water with
water all around the islands, right?

563
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:59,190
So that makes an enormous difference
how these ions are going to interact,

564
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:01,530
what solvent you're in,
and it makes quite a difference.

565
00:37:01,531 --> 00:37:06,480
What solvent and notice down to acetone,
the solvents might be considered polar.

566
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:09,510
That is,
they have pretty big dielectric constants.

567
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:13,830
So they really attenuate the energy
of interaction between the ions.

568
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:17,940
But chloroform,
ether hexane or not very polar,

569
00:37:17,941 --> 00:37:19,530
they don't cut it down very much.

570
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:25,850
Now this has to do with things like the
solubility or the melting point of salts

571
00:37:26,641 --> 00:37:29,730
like sodium chloride or uh,

572
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:32,460
or Tetra methyl ammonium iodide.

573
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:36,690
Because notice that these
ions are rather small,

574
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,550
so the charges are close together,

575
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,660
but these ions are big so they're
substantially further apart.

576
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,590
And that's going to make an enormous
difference in when you're starting to pull

577
00:37:46,591 --> 00:37:51,240
them apart, right? If you, if you
go to twice the distance here,

578
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:55,370
right? You really cut
this way down so that, uh,

579
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,230
so that cesium,
cesium iodide,

580
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:03,410
sodium chloride has a melting point
of something like 801 Celsius.

581
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,660
But cesium iodide,
the same charges,

582
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:11,680
but bigger ions is 200 degrees lower and
it's melting point and the solubilities

583
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,370
reflect the same thing.

584
00:38:14,371 --> 00:38:18,750
It's easier to get the solids apart
if you're starting with bigger ions.

585
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,730
Okay? So the big interaction
is charged, charged,

586
00:38:22,731 --> 00:38:26,610
but there are others that are
important to charge with dipole.

587
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,900
So if you have a molecule
that's not charged but has
a dissymmetry in the charge,

588
00:38:30,901 --> 00:38:33,630
that's within it.
So it has a plus and a minus in,

589
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:38,830
then those can interact and
that's proportional to one
over r squared so it dies

590
00:38:38,831 --> 00:38:41,560
away more rapidly.
Right.

591
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:45,850
And if the dipole can orient so that
you have to average over different ways,

592
00:38:45,851 --> 00:38:46,900
it could be oriented,

593
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:51,610
it would be oriented more likely in the
favorable than in the unfavorable way.

594
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:55,870
But that depends on the temperature
and if you have that situation,

595
00:38:56,050 --> 00:39:00,700
it turns out to be our to the minus forth
over temperature because of how much

596
00:39:00,701 --> 00:39:03,880
is favored one way or the other.
Okay.

597
00:39:03,881 --> 00:39:05,820
Then if you go to uh,

598
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:10,980
charged with something that's non polar
but could become polar if it's put in

599
00:39:11,901 --> 00:39:15,760
the field of another charge.
So you put the push the nucleus one way,

600
00:39:15,761 --> 00:39:20,761
the electrons the other way and now you
get a charge interacting with an induced

601
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:25,950
dipole that that depends on our to
the minus three one over r cubed.

602
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:30,940
Then you can have two dipoles
interacting with one another.

603
00:39:30,941 --> 00:39:35,590
That's also one over r cubed or you can
have to induce things interacting with

604
00:39:35,591 --> 00:39:38,830
one another. Have you ever
seen that before? Where the,

605
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:43,420
how the electrons are distributed
in this one, when they're over here,

606
00:39:43,421 --> 00:39:46,600
the ones here tend to be over there.
And when these are here, these are here.

607
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:49,900
Where did we encounter that before?
Yeah.

608
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:55,780
Correlation energies.
Right? Okay. So, uh, that,

609
00:39:55,781 --> 00:40:00,040
that turns out to be our to the sixth
power. So notice that these others,

610
00:40:00,041 --> 00:40:03,310
other than the Coolo,
they fall off very,

611
00:40:03,311 --> 00:40:08,080
very rapidly and they
start very weak, right? So,

612
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:11,800
so there you might think
you could neglect them,

613
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,840
but there could be a lot of them.

614
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:18,790
That's the problem when there are
many solvent molecules around. Okay.

615
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:23,740
Now let's look at some trends in the
highlights and whatever textbook you have,

616
00:40:23,741 --> 00:40:27,490
you'll find this guy did the, when we
talk about different functional groups,

617
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:31,720
we're talking about the alcohol haylight
now typically chapters in all the books

618
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:32,200
you look at.

619
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:36,340
We'll start with something about the
physical properties of those compounds and

620
00:40:36,341 --> 00:40:38,020
then go onto their chemical properties.

621
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:42,620
So this is a little bit about physical
properties of the highlights. So, uh,

622
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:44,440
here we look at the van der walls,

623
00:40:44,441 --> 00:40:47,860
radius of the Halogen X.
Right?

624
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:52,210
And here we look at the bond
distance between x and carbon.

625
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:55,420
And you notice they're
almost exactly the same.

626
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,790
And we learned something from that,

627
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:02,980
which is that non bonded distances or
something like twice bonded distances,

628
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:05,020
right?
Because the rate,

629
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:10,070
the radius of an atom is about the same
as the distance from the nucleus of the

630
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:15,700
atom is the nucleus of
the carbon, right? So the,

631
00:41:15,701 --> 00:41:19,850
so that means that the, that the
covalent radius is about half the, uh,

632
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:25,180
the van der walls radius.
Okay. Now here's the property,

633
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:29,800
the dipole moment, right? How,
how polar is the molecule,

634
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,220
right? And it's the, the dipole moment

635
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:34,791
shown here.

636
00:41:34,791 --> 00:41:37,700
What do you notice about that as you
go fluorine and chlorine and bromine?

637
00:41:37,701 --> 00:41:40,720
Iodine.
What's the first thing you do

638
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:45,010
notice about the trend
doesn't work for age,

639
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:50,560
Derek with h? Uh, well I
didn't put it, if you have age,

640
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:55,000
it turns out there is no dipole
moment because it's with methyl.

641
00:41:55,210 --> 00:42:00,210
So h c h three is a symmetrical molecule
in the center of the electrons is the

642
00:42:00,761 --> 00:42:04,900
same as the center of
the Nuclei. So, but what,

643
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:08,470
here's one. The red is a
trend as you go, well forget,

644
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:11,920
forget hydrogen because it's, it's
not really a halogen. But here,

645
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:15,880
here's radios, the d, The bond distance.

646
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:20,050
What's special about this one? About
the yellow, the orange one, Lauren.

647
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:25,400
Pardon me? It goes up and
down. It's not monotonic.

648
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,340
What do you learn when you see
trends that are not monotonic?

649
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:37,390
There must be two things
going on. So what's the other
thing here? We're interest

650
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:40,610
in the Po in how much charge is separated?

651
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:45,380
Here we have a ch three and a halogen.

652
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:51,460
So the dipole moment is
how big the charges are and
how much they're separated.

653
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:56,420
Right now we already see here
how much they're separated.

654
00:42:56,421 --> 00:43:00,530
That is what the distance is.
But how big is the charge? Right?

655
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:05,390
So if we look here, this is
incidentally majored in Dubai units,

656
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,500
which if you multiply by a,

657
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:11,900
which is 4.8 times the
charge times the separation,

658
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:14,870
now we know the separation.
Uh,

659
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:18,350
and we noticed that it's not
monotonic and here's the charge.

660
00:43:18,351 --> 00:43:23,090
How many electrons have been transferred,
right? And that's quite monotonic,

661
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:24,913
right?

662
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:30,410
But what we've seen here is that the
dipole moment is the product of two

663
00:43:30,411 --> 00:43:34,550
properties. How much charge
and how much separated, right?

664
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:38,030
But they're opposing trends.
As one goes up,

665
00:43:38,031 --> 00:43:41,840
the other goes down and
although they're both monotonic,

666
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:45,020
one is nonlinear,
more nonlinear than the other,

667
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:49,250
so they don't exactly cancel one another
and going up and down and you get weird

668
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:51,230
behavior. This, this, uh,

669
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:54,950
this when you have conflicting
nonlinear trends. Okay,

670
00:43:54,951 --> 00:43:58,760
so there were two things going on to
give the dipole moment. Now the other,

671
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:03,140
you can see similar kinds of thing in
another measure of the size of atoms,

672
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:05,420
which is so called a value.

673
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:10,750
That's how much is axial compared
to Ecuadorian in cyclohexane?

674
00:44:11,330 --> 00:44:14,630
Axial is more crowded than Ecuadorian is.

675
00:44:14,631 --> 00:44:18,890
We talked about this last semester.
So if we know how much is it,

676
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:22,070
what the energy differences
between axial and equatorial,

677
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:26,210
we have some measure of how
big that group is. All right?

678
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:30,710
So it's the axial minus energy
equatorial in kilocalories from also that

679
00:44:30,711 --> 00:44:32,340
measures size.

680
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:37,080
Now here are the values for the
halogens and hydrogen, incidentally,

681
00:44:37,081 --> 00:44:41,220
which is defined as zero because you're
comparing hydrogen with hydrogen.

682
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:45,990
Okay, so here it is, and again,
you see it's not monotonic,

683
00:44:45,991 --> 00:44:48,840
it goes up and down.
So there must be two things involved.

684
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:53,650
What are the two things? One of the
things is how big the Vanderwall is,

685
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:57,840
radius of the atom is, which clearly gets
bigger as you go. Flooring, chlorine,

686
00:44:57,841 --> 00:44:59,970
bromine, iodine. But why does this,

687
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:03,960
why does the effect on axial
versus equatorial? Go up and down.

688
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:06,600
Why doesn't it just go up?
The bond?

689
00:45:06,601 --> 00:45:08,860
This is between the carbon
and the substituent. Ah,

690
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:13,020
because the bond gets longer
as the Adam gets bigger, right?

691
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:18,030
So it's not not a tonic that suggests
there's a competition. So here's fluorine.

692
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:19,350
That's what's shown here.

693
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:24,120
And now watch this model is I
changed from fluorine to iodine.

694
00:45:24,121 --> 00:45:29,070
And what happened? The Adam
gets bigger, not shown to scale,

695
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,860
but the bond gets longer,
right?

696
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:36,240
So you have a larger Vander walls radius,
but it stands off further.

697
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,370
So it's not so dramatic.
The difference.

698
00:45:38,371 --> 00:45:42,600
Now compare that with what if
the group there is ch three,

699
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:48,000
right? Because ch three has, has this,

700
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:50,550
uh,
effective Vander walls radius.

701
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:54,180
So that's how I decided where
to put it on this scale, right?

702
00:45:54,181 --> 00:45:55,980
It's got the right Vanderwalt radius,

703
00:45:56,580 --> 00:46:01,580
but the bond distance for carbon carbon
is much shorter than it is for bromine

704
00:46:01,621 --> 00:46:05,880
and iodine or chlorine for that. Or it's
about, it's about the same as fluorine,

705
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:10,290
right? Or a little bit bigger. Okay. And
now when we put these two things together,

706
00:46:10,291 --> 00:46:13,860
in order to get the a value there,
there's,

707
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:18,300
we got this big group and it's come
in some compared to the halogens.

708
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:23,960
Now you see there's a really wild
outlier in this thing because of the,

709
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:29,040
because you now have a big group
to ch three and it's short.

710
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:34,260
So it, so even though, even
though the radius of, of, of, uh,

711
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:36,030
of methyl is about,

712
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:41,070
is about between bromine denied in its
effect on this as much bigger because it

713
00:46:41,071 --> 00:46:43,620
sits in closer.
Okay?

714
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:48,360
Now the boiling points of the [inaudible],
here's a table.

715
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:49,830
We could have taken it from any book.

716
00:46:49,831 --> 00:46:54,570
This particular one is from the Jones
tax that chose different al kill groups

717
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:59,850
and the hydrogen fluorine,
chlorine, bromine. I'd and
what are the boiling points?

718
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,340
Now,
let's just see if we can understand this.

719
00:47:02,341 --> 00:47:04,710
I'm going to go just a little
bit further because we had that.

720
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:09,180
We started late with people getting here
late and we had that little break in

721
00:47:09,181 --> 00:47:14,130
the class. Okay, so let's look
at the boiling points. So high,

722
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:16,110
so methane,
methane,

723
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:21,030
the one with hydro methyl with hydrogen
is very low boiling and then it gets

724
00:47:21,031 --> 00:47:25,740
higher and higher and higher. That is
the liquid tends to hold together more.

725
00:47:25,770 --> 00:47:30,220
Not to go into the gas phase. The
molecules are holding together more. Now,

726
00:47:30,221 --> 00:47:35,140
the question is why? Why when we replace
hydrogen by fluorine, by chlorine,

727
00:47:35,141 --> 00:47:39,340
by bromine,
by Ayah than does the boiling point Yo up?

728
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,620
What causes the molecules
to hold together?

729
00:47:45,710 --> 00:47:47,140
It's not covalent bonds.

730
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:53,540
We're talking about non bonding
interactions. What is it? That whole,

731
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:56,540
what could make them altogether?
We know the fundamental forces.

732
00:47:56,541 --> 00:47:58,110
That's what we just,
it's cool.

733
00:47:58,111 --> 00:48:01,700
It was law as colored by
dipoles and things like that.

734
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:05,450
They are here tiresome.
Taco hydrogen,

735
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:10,190
hydrogen bonds as an idea now that you're
not going to get hydrogen bonds when

736
00:48:10,191 --> 00:48:10,900
you don't have hydro

737
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:11,733
region,

738
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:14,320
right?
So the halogens I stuck on to work for,

739
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:18,100
and the next thing we're going to talk
about is hydrogen bonds that that'll come

740
00:48:18,101 --> 00:48:21,730
in the next class. Now, any other ideas
of what holds them together? Date,

741
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:28,330
I even have polar interactions,
right? So you'd have dipoles slid,

742
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:31,020
interacting even though
there are no charges. Okay?

743
00:48:31,021 --> 00:48:33,000
So let's look at the dipole moment,

744
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:37,290
which was on that previous table
and you see that methane has zero,

745
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:42,210
but fluorine has 1.85 so that's going
to allow the molecules to hold together,

746
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:46,860
okay? So raise the boiling point because
you could have them lined up this way,

747
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:51,870
right? But that's not just polarity
because if we go across here,

748
00:48:51,871 --> 00:48:54,900
the polarity went up,
but then it goes down again.

749
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:57,900
But the boiling point keeps going up.

750
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:02,370
So there must be something else other
than that these dipoles holding together.

751
00:49:03,330 --> 00:49:08,330
And that other thing is polarizability
how easy it is to shift the electrons in

752
00:49:10,081 --> 00:49:13,980
the molecule and how many electrons
there are to shift. So you see,

753
00:49:13,981 --> 00:49:16,410
if you look at fluorine,
chlorine, bromine,

754
00:49:16,411 --> 00:49:19,570
and I had an Adams rite fluid.

755
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:22,290
Adam is very not non polarizable.

756
00:49:22,291 --> 00:49:25,410
When you bring a charge
or a dipole near it,

757
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:29,730
it doesn't distort very much,
but chlorine distorts more bromine.

758
00:49:29,731 --> 00:49:33,780
And I had in the most, because it has
the most electrons, the most weakly held,

759
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:38,310
right.
Or if we and ch four is not polar.

760
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:43,500
And also it's not very
polarizable. Right. Uh,

761
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:44,760
the hydrocarbon is,

762
00:49:44,761 --> 00:49:49,620
is not very polarizable given that it's
five Adams of these are just one atom.

763
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:53,820
So, uh, next time we'll start,

764
00:49:53,850 --> 00:49:58,380
we'll start at this point and go in to
try to understand the boiling point of

765
00:49:58,381 --> 00:50:01,290
the alkanes without the halogen on them.

766
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:06,600
Thanks for Europe patients with
changing horses in midstream.
