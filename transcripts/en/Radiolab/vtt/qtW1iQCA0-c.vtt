00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.420
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich Radiolab.

2
00:00:03.421 --> 00:00:08.421
Today we are continuing our search for ways to outside oneself,

3
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.540
solve the problems going on inside oneself. Ooh, that's nicely done.

4
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.260
Now thinking back to Oliver's sexist story that we heard at the top of the last

5
00:00:16.261 --> 00:00:19.230
segment, this notion that you,

6
00:00:19.231 --> 00:00:21.540
one might use terror to, uh,

7
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.330
to broker a relationship with one's creative self or one's perhaps addicted

8
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.390
self. Let's take that idea and kick it up a notch. Maybe two notches.

9
00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:33.360
I mean for that we go to report or Gregory Warner.

10
00:00:33.361 --> 00:00:37.020
Reporter with marketplace though marketplace was nice enough to let us borrow

11
00:00:37.021 --> 00:00:40.320
him for this story. He's a budget. Tell right now. You understand that?

12
00:00:40.321 --> 00:00:44.130
I have no idea. Gregory. None. Whatever what it is you're about to tell me. I,

13
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.440
I have been purposely kept in the dark. Yes.

14
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.590
Unless of course you have already told me somewhere. No,

15
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.400
I'm sure you've forgotten to Greg. Just set it up.

16
00:00:53.401 --> 00:00:58.110
How did you find out about this? I heard about it, um, while washing dishes.

17
00:00:58.111 --> 00:01:02.010
Actually my wife was telling me about a friend's ex boyfriend who was an

18
00:01:02.011 --> 00:01:05.040
alcoholic. Friends, ex boyfriend friends,

19
00:01:05.041 --> 00:01:09.240
ex boyfriend is an alcoholic in Russia. He's, he's, he's Russian. And um,

20
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.390
this man didn't want to drink anymore and so the treatment that he got was to

21
00:01:15.591 --> 00:01:19.730
have a capsule surgically inserted under the skin,

22
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.690
some kind of chemical compound that if he drank again,

23
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.970
this capsule would explode into his bloodstream and kill it.

24
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.790
What? Which he was given the bomb. Yeah,

25
00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.210
but that would be triggered by his bed behave. Exactly. And that's all you knew.

26
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.270
That's all I knew. Well, but wait a second. Who would, who would do this? Who,

27
00:01:39.271 --> 00:01:42.710
who did he go to? Well, that's, that's what I did.

28
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.610
Fortunately I was on my way to Russia.

29
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.420
And what was the question in your mind was what's this real check check?

30
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.760
So I get to Moscow and I hired a fixer interpreter.

31
00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.660
Her name is Ana Musta Nova. It's hard to tell what street I'm on right now.

32
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.870
She had found this clinic that does this treatment.

33
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.200
We go in through the gate, call this area, lungs of Moscow, lungs of Moscow,

34
00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:15.290
because the wind is coming through this area and we arrive at this sort of large

35
00:02:17.191 --> 00:02:20.040
house, kind of a drab exterior.

36
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.220
They assured us immediately into a waiting room.

37
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.600
<v 1>[inaudible] there's a fish tank. Is there plants? The House pretty lush,</v>

38
00:02:30.601 --> 00:02:33.660
so it wasn't very hospitaly. No, not very hospitaly very,

39
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.210
very comfortable guys around lazy fish and then [inaudible]

40
00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.980
<v 0>for summit. Hi, my name is head doctor.</v>

41
00:02:43.981 --> 00:02:48.210
His name is just slow or slow yet just slow Davita. He greets us.

42
00:02:48.211 --> 00:02:52.500
We become into his pretty spare office. Going to describe the vouchers live.

43
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.560
That'd be enough. He looks actually exactly as you'd, yes.

44
00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.590
A a a Russian psychotherapist and our cologists with luck of no guessing for

45
00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.400
that. Maybe. Maybe I'd take that back.

46
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.200
He's got a beard and he's got a bulbous head.

47
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.210
He musically bright, bright green eyes.

48
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.770
[inaudible] this man is a doctor and this man is absolutely a doctor. No,

49
00:03:14.771 --> 00:03:18.600
I wish. No, there are degrees on the wall. [inaudible]

50
00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.090
<v 2>yeah, so usually this capsule is inserted into the buttocks,</v>

51
00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.370
right? The wind as well as therapy.

52
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.280
That actually if that's why it was cold at torpedo

53
00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:31.060
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

54
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.000
<v 2>because it is placed in a person's body and kept the way at RPD and Assembler</v>

55
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.113
ring is kept

56
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.100
<v 0>your butt well under the skin. And how does, if the person drinks,</v>

57
00:03:42.101 --> 00:03:45.700
does it make them sick or does it make them die?

58
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.740
<v 2>Basically she smeared Newseum. He said, you know, it doesn't,</v>

59
00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.473
shouldn't kill you.

60
00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.910
One can never exclude death,

61
00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.840
but of course the doctor is not going to kill his patient,

62
00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.280
which in block loop but personal with you,

63
00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.510
it's very bad, extremely bad. [inaudible]

64
00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.040
<v 0>you will have uh,</v>

65
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.680
pains almost in thereabout palate.

66
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.330
GALOP accelerated heart rate than that with shortness of breath, everything,

67
00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:24.170
nausea, vomiting, throbbing headache date, visual disturbance,

68
00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.550
mental confusion and circulatory collapse.

69
00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.680
<v 2>And these medicine can remain in the body from a short period of time, two,</v>

70
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:37.090
three years for instance.

71
00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.570
<v 0>But the pill is real well,</v>

72
00:04:43.571 --> 00:04:48.571
so that's exactly what I asked them next is the capsule in some way a placebo

73
00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.370
[inaudible] yeah, that's the new possible yet. It's not a policy.

74
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:54.423
<v 2>It's not a placebo.</v>

75
00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.850
[inaudible] if you don't believe I can give you a pill and that will be like

76
00:04:59.851 --> 00:05:01.050
coding for one day.

77
00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.430
<v 0>Okay. Hello. Wait, and you agreed.</v>

78
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.930
Freaking pal said I would and um, can you give me a pill that would last, um,

79
00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.870
three years, uh, but tell him yet the political

80
00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.890
[inaudible] [inaudible] if you agree, Greg Gray. What the phrase? No,

81
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.060
I'll tell you what I was thinking because at this point,

82
00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.570
IVF and I had been talking for like two hours and he hadn't let me out of the

83
00:05:26.571 --> 00:05:30.800
office. I had asked to see the procedure room. I'd asked to see the torpedo.

84
00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.730
And so I realized the only way to actually see it was to agree to have it done.

85
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.240
[inaudible] patient. Yeah. Ready? Yeah.

86
00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:44.850
That's cool. We leave the office, we go down a hallway and up some stairs.

87
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:51.000
There's no lush carpet, no fish tanks, no plants.

88
00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:56.920
Is that someone's screaming? Yeah. Yeah.

89
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:02.660
[inaudible] good buddies. It's a psychiatric clinic.

90
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.140
You don't want my translators getting worried. She's like a friend. You know,

91
00:06:06.141 --> 00:06:08.660
if you meet a friend in Russia, you have to go drinking with them. I said,

92
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:10.370
I'll die in his arm.

93
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.530
So he leads me into this room. It looks, I mean,

94
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.220
just like an exam room in a doctor's clinic.

95
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:23.740
There's this sink in the nurse part. Defibrillator machine. No. Yeah.

96
00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.590
Can I see the, uh, [inaudible] and he just immediately ignores me.

97
00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.060
Go ahead and get it. Picks up some instruments,

98
00:06:29.061 --> 00:06:33.450
washes his hands and I see the torpedo. Oh, I'm good. I guess it was.

99
00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:36.180
He then turns and he says, yes, there is a [inaudible].

100
00:06:36.181 --> 00:06:39.860
He does a stabbing motion with his foot. His hand make a small cut.

101
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:41.090
This is how deep it is.

102
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:46.670
[inaudible] so he's going in, well,

103
00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:49.640
just before he's going to actually cut open my butt.

104
00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.110
And he does this with everybody. He gives you a pill, which is the same drug,

105
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.820
but it only lasts for one day. And then he tests it. He tests it.

106
00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.750
How does that work? Can you take a pill and it'll give you a [inaudible]?

107
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:07.600
He puts just a drop of vodka, a small job of on your towel drop.

108
00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.800
Once that drop of vodka hits my tongue, I will feel all those symptoms.

109
00:07:12.801 --> 00:07:17.190
You had sinks. You can't breathe in January. A personal pills. He's dying.

110
00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:18.273
What bullet?

111
00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.570
[inaudible] sometimes people are so scared that urinate right here.

112
00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.420
Maybe a, uh, can I take it at home?

113
00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:38.800
So I, uh, actually no, I don't want to take chicken out. Can't do it.

114
00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:40.930
I'm not, I'm not strong enough.

115
00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:44.770
He at that point realized he'd won w and he shows me the pillows.

116
00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:49.300
This is what is inserted in the body. Really. This is it.

117
00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:54.800
It's so little little mmm.

118
00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:59.610
<v 2>About the size of a, uh, protect tech. Ticktack okay.</v>

119
00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:02.340
The Ticketek torpedo hits comes right off the lips.

120
00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:06.300
It turns out that inside that little pill is a very real truck.

121
00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:08.460
It's called [inaudible] and it was out.

122
00:08:08.461 --> 00:08:11.340
It was actually a substance that was used in the rubber industry.

123
00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:12.960
This Eugene did Eugene Reichel,

124
00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:16.050
I'm an assistant professor at the University of Chicago.

125
00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:19.050
He's writing a whole book about these treatment programs in Russia.

126
00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:22.620
He says this drug was discovered back in the early 19 hundreds and they found

127
00:08:22.621 --> 00:08:27.360
that the a workers in the rubber industry where unable to tolerate alcohol,

128
00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:30.300
this is kind of folk knowledge in that, in that industry for awhile.

129
00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:33.650
So it wasn't like don't give that guy a beer. He works in rubber. I know.

130
00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:40.640
Basically what they sell fram does is it creates a kind of toxic byproduct.

131
00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:44.960
They still for in blocks a certain enzyme from being absorbed and it causes all

132
00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:48.060
these very real symptoms. So you'd get a little bit poisoned. Yeah.

133
00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:51.980
And is this used outside of these Russian clinics? It is, but,

134
00:08:51.981 --> 00:08:55.860
but there is a big difference only in, in Russian clinics they have these

135
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:57.630
<v 0>long acting captain,</v>

136
00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.940
<v 4>the long acting form of Basal Harambe,</v>

137
00:08:59.941 --> 00:09:03.330
which is not something that exists.

138
00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:06.660
The subdermal implants basically,

139
00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:11.340
they don't actually release any deisel for em after, you know,

140
00:09:11.341 --> 00:09:12.900
the first week or something like that.

141
00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:15.400
<v 0>So, so if I had taken that drop of alcohol,</v>

142
00:09:15.401 --> 00:09:17.410
then I would have felt all those symptoms.

143
00:09:17.411 --> 00:09:20.170
But it doesn't last for longer than a week.

144
00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:25.220
<v 4>Yeah. So effectively. That's basically a scam.</v>

145
00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:30.200
I believe scam is the word you're looking for. Um, how mainstream is this?

146
00:09:30.201 --> 00:09:30.531
I mean,

147
00:09:30.531 --> 00:09:34.070
is this the equivalent of like guava pills or whatever they are where you,

148
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.790
you can find them in like vitamin shops, but they're kind of fringy.

149
00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:41.540
That's the thing is that this is not fringy at all. You know,

150
00:09:41.541 --> 00:09:46.541
over 60% of the treatment methods offered by Russian Nikon narcotics.

151
00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.990
<v 0>Zero 60 more than half. Yes. Yes.</v>

152
00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:53.720
And Eugene emailed later to say he was just being conservative.

153
00:09:53.721 --> 00:09:55.670
The real number is closer to 80%

154
00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:58.390
<v 2>mm. Wow. Coded,</v>

155
00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:02.890
which happened 15 years before he died. My, my own translator,

156
00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:06.550
honor her uncle went through this procedure when he, when he was drunk,

157
00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.670
he didn't care before.

158
00:10:09.671 --> 00:10:14.671
I remember my grandmother crying all the time because you could go fishing and

159
00:10:16.721 --> 00:10:20.810
then disappear for a night and this guy, textbook alcoholic,

160
00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:25.020
everybody knew that he was drunk, went through this coding procedure.

161
00:10:25.021 --> 00:10:28.150
It's called coding because it wasn't the drug form that goes in your bud.

162
00:10:28.151 --> 00:10:31.930
It was actually a, it's a kind of hypnotic suggestion that goes in your brain,

163
00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:36.490
but, but same general procedure doctrine, the light go,

164
00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:40.360
he was doing something with his hands, some,

165
00:10:40.361 --> 00:10:45.361
some gestures in front of Sergei's face and then he Sergei closed his eyes and

166
00:10:46.841 --> 00:10:49.050
he had a feeling that, uh,

167
00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:54.420
some we could force was pulled out of his body

168
00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:58.940
<v 0>and this guy finished high school. This guy was an aeronautical engineer.</v>

169
00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:00.580
<v 4>Oh. My sense is that,</v>

170
00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:06.260
that there's some people who suspend their disbelief because at some level they

171
00:11:06.401 --> 00:11:09.190
have the motivation to do that. But if it only lasts a week,

172
00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:13.540
why wouldn't people like after two weeks or a month or six months, just start,

173
00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.660
just take it to sip and realize, oh, nothing happened.

174
00:11:16.661 --> 00:11:19.270
And they just start drinking again. But some people do. Some people do.

175
00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:19.931
First of all,

176
00:11:19.931 --> 00:11:24.931
there are lots of people who do go to 12 step therapy and who guru could do go

177
00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:30.460
2% 60% you said that 80% no, no, no, no. I know, I know. It's,

178
00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:33.370
it is very prevalent and very popular. So No, the story,

179
00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:35.890
<v 0>we thought there's something Russian about this. Yeah.</v>

180
00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:38.920
That it's got a sense of submission and belief,

181
00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:43.720
all sort of asserted by a higher authority with no way to check or to second

182
00:11:43.721 --> 00:11:48.721
guess ev even the way in which repression is used instead of acceptance.

183
00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:54.370
It just feels very rushed and wouldn't work in Manhattan. Work in Los Angeles

184
00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:58.870
<v 4>wouldn't work in Chicago. I think that here's the distinction in North America,</v>

185
00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:02.320
the prevailing understanding of addiction is that it's a disease of denial.

186
00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:06.160
It's not about the substance as much as it is about the fact that you're kind of

187
00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:10.720
out of touch with some kind of truths about your self and your condition.

188
00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:15.400
That's a radically different understanding of what the problem is, um,

189
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:17.710
than the one that underlies the Saturday interrupt.

190
00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:21.800
<v 0>As a skeptical American, I got to say there is something about this treatment,</v>

191
00:12:21.801 --> 00:12:23.750
this Russian treatment that makes sense to me.

192
00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:25.910
Seems to me when you're in the grips of an addiction,

193
00:12:25.911 --> 00:12:29.270
you've already lost control of a certain part of yourself or a part of yourself

194
00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.310
is already in control. That shouldn't be,

195
00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:35.870
and you can try and kind of love that part and make peace with it and hug it and

196
00:12:35.871 --> 00:12:39.680
do the 12 step thing or you could destroy it, you know,

197
00:12:39.681 --> 00:12:42.660
build a wall around it so that you don't have to deal with it. That's

198
00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:45.690
<v 2>David [inaudible] is so good at imprisoning that part of you.</v>

199
00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:51.990
[inaudible] punish skeptic. Do you know what a panic attacks of panic are?

200
00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:56.280
Stuff like [inaudible] struck. Struck is fear. Fear.

201
00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:01.080
There is strong fear. Do you understand what it is? Strong, very strong fear.

202
00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:03.390
This is when somebody, Dr. David,

203
00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:08.340
I've told me that he had trained as a psychotherapist during the Soviet war in

204
00:13:08.341 --> 00:13:13.341
Afghanistan in the 80s he says to me it to where we just imagine a situation

205
00:13:14.311 --> 00:13:16.530
where a soldier sees his friend on the road.

206
00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:22.200
He has mines tied to his body. He has no ears, no eyes.

207
00:13:22.201 --> 00:13:25.830
His legs are compatible with these look normal, but he's still alive.

208
00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:28.170
[inaudible] private. According to all rules.

209
00:13:28.171 --> 00:13:31.120
This kind of person should be taken to the hospital. Wait, so,

210
00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:35.250
but after seeing this, every soldier says to his friend,

211
00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:39.390
if you find me in this kind of condition, tortured by the Mujahideen,

212
00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:44.820
godly kill me, just bloating, watching, go to these tortures,

213
00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:50.090
slammed Rizzio yesterday. Women can drive a person crazy beat.

214
00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:53.470
Is that just something he was having you imagine?

215
00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:57.330
Or are you saying that something he saw, that's something he saw?

216
00:13:57.390 --> 00:14:02.040
Would he learn from the way in which these mujahideen were fighting?

217
00:14:02.041 --> 00:14:05.100
This war is that you can,

218
00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:08.550
you can kill your enemy. That's one method of warfare.

219
00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:10.290
Or you can strike fear

220
00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:16.110
into the heart of your enemy and kill not only that soldier,

221
00:14:16.111 --> 00:14:19.470
but terrorize his whole Putin, uh,

222
00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:22.930
[inaudible] and what rules this world's throw

223
00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:31.880
[inaudible] if he could make you afraid he could change your,

224
00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:37.460
this coding, it's completely changed his life.

225
00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:41.300
This is your uncle? Yeah. He became very, uh,

226
00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:46.040
I had a feeling that he sort of discovered the life for himself.

227
00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:49.940
Once again, he started gardening.

228
00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:53.150
He picking mushrooms.

229
00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:56.390
Do you think coding worked?

230
00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:01.220
I guess? Yeah. I don't know how it worked,

231
00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:06.230
but it did work for him because he hadn't drank to the rest of his life.

232
00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:21.730
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

233
00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:25.780
<v 2>thanks Greg. All right, thanks. Okay. I got to say that,</v>

234
00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:31.030
that right there, that's Ulysses contract, except for instead of the rope,

235
00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:31.880
you got fear,

236
00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:36.200
<v 0>right? As opposed to say if a Ulysses went through, um,</v>

237
00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:38.480
went through, you know,

238
00:15:38.481 --> 00:15:43.310
counseling about the sirens and it's not necessarily, you know, in fact,

239
00:15:43.311 --> 00:15:46.700
the sirens aren't that hot. In fact, you'll die. Uh, yeah. And they, you know,

240
00:15:46.701 --> 00:15:49.190
you really have a wife and she's nice too. Anyhow,

241
00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:51.410
thanks to marketplace for letting US borrow. Greg.

242
00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:55.230
Greg has a great series he's putting together on, uh, what does it, yeah.

243
00:15:55.231 --> 00:15:58.460
A series of stories on marketplace about the economics of healthcare and in

244
00:15:58.461 --> 00:16:03.050
Russia, which you can get to from marketplace.org or also radiolab.org.

245
00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:06.910
And if you go there, you can subscribe to our podcast even while you listen.

246
00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:09.710
This is life. Penelope just signed up the other week.
