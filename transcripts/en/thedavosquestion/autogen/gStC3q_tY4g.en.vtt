so it was a good question that how the

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810
so it was a good question that how the
 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.200
so it was a good question that how the
whole India India where which lesson

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210
whole India India where which lesson
 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.640
whole India India where which lesson
village or India lives and urban India

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:15.650
 
 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.090
 
the real minimum of Cana me is only when

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:19.100
the real minimum of Cana me is only when
 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.480

every Indian is being benefited by this

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.490
every Indian is being benefited by this

every Indian is being benefited by this
economic growth

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560
economic growth
 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.179
economic growth
so what I believed strongly is that we

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189
so what I believed strongly is that we
 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.330
so what I believed strongly is that we
have to think big we have to think that

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340
have to think big we have to think that
 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.750
have to think big we have to think that
there is a system which is populated of

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760
there is a system which is populated of
 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.360
there is a system which is populated of
1.2 billion people and how this people

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370
1.2 billion people and how this people
 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.920
1.2 billion people and how this people
can sustain and how these people can

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930
can sustain and how these people can
 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.540
can sustain and how these people can
participate in to the economic process

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550
participate in to the economic process
 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.530
participate in to the economic process
so if we raise this question that means

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:47.540
so if we raise this question that means
 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.210
so if we raise this question that means
there has to be a mechanism in which

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:51.220
there has to be a mechanism in which
 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.100
there has to be a mechanism in which
Indians and large has to be participate

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110
Indians and large has to be participate
 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.680
Indians and large has to be participate
in to economic growth and it has to be

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690
in to economic growth and it has to be
 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.280
in to economic growth and it has to be
inclusive growth so the first step is

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290
inclusive growth so the first step is
 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.750
inclusive growth so the first step is
about

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760

combination of economy and are we going

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680
combination of economy and are we going
 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.160

economy are going to be the hard economy
 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.109
economy are going to be the hard economy
or the mix of the hard and soft and then

or the mix of the hard and soft and then
 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.880
or the mix of the hard and soft and then
the question arises do we have an

think this will take care of the whole
country and it will involve lot of

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230
country and it will involve lot of
 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.990
