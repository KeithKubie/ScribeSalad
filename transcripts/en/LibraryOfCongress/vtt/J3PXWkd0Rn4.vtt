00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.030
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Peterson: My
name is Betsy Peterson.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.170
I'm the director of the American
Folklife Center here at the Library

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.050
of Congress, and I'd like to
welcome you for the latest

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.960
in our ongoing Benjamin
Botkin lecture series.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.070
The Botkin series allows
the American Folklife Center

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.920
to do a couple of things.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.800
Most importantly, it allows
us to highlight the work

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.420
of leading scholars in folklore,
ethnomusicology, oral history,

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:51.860
and other cultural studies.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.830
And for the center in the library,
it also is an important part

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.680
of our acquisition activity.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.260
Each lecture is videotaped
and makes its way

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.350
into the permanent collections of
our center, and also makes its way

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.550
onto the web as a webcast
that allows us to share this

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.560
with patients throughout the
world and for generations to come.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.200
So with that said, please turn off
any electronic devices you might

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.550
have right now or you will
be in our archive forever.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.640
And today I have a wonderful honor.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.880
I have the honor of introducing
a distinguished folklorist

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.080
and dear colleague, Jane
Beck, who is the founder

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.530
and executive director emeritus
of the Vermont Folklife Center.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.570
Beck first became interested

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.650
in folklore while an undergraduate
student at Middlebury College,

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.990
and went on to earn a Masters
and Doctorate in folklore

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.550
at the University of Pennsylvania.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:58.530
In 1983 she returned to Vermont to
found the Vermont Folklife Center

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.510
in Middlebury, and subsequently
served as its executive director

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.430
until her retirement in 2007.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.420
And during this time she
grew the Folklife Center

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.250
into an incredible influential and
robust institution that continues

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.240
to provide outstanding
public education, research,

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.570
and archival services
to the state of Vermont.

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.800 position:56%
Jane is the author of numerous
articles, radio programs, curricula,

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.700
slideshows, videos,
books, museum exhibits,

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.150
you name it, she's done it.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.030
Jane has also published in
numerous journals and magazines,

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.710
including Canadian Folklore,
Yankee, and Vermont Folklife

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.270
and has been aired frequently

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:51.230 position:56%
on stations including Vermont Public
Radio and Adirondack Public Radio,

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.900
and in fact is the recipient of
a Peabody Award for radio work

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:02.320
that she did focusing on Daisy
Turner back in the '70s or '80s.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.620
&gt;&gt; '90s.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.190
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Peterson: '90s, okay.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.730
Over the course of
her impressive career,

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.040
Jane has also served two terms
as president and several years

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.520
as board member for the
American Folklore Society.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.240
She was a trustee for
Vermont Shelburne Museum.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.890
She sat on the Smithsonian
Advisory Council for the Bureau

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.770
of Folklife Programs
and Cultural Studies,

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.300
and most significantly
certainly for all

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.130
of us Folklife Center folks here,
she was a member of the Board

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.690
of the American Folklife Center.

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.560
Jane has received numerous
prestigious awards,

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.060
as you can imagine with
that sort of resume,

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.840
including the governor's
extraordinary Vermonter Award

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.290
in 1990.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.430
Ah, okay, a Peabody
Award in 1990 as well,

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.010
and the name of the radio program

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.500
on Daisy Turner was
called Journey's End.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.710
She's also an honorary doctorate
from Middlebury College,

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.140
a recipient of the
Benjamin Botkin Award

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.140
from the American Folklore Society,
the Vermont Governor's Award

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.490
for Excellence in the Arts, and
a Lifetime Achievement Award

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.490
from the Center for
Research in Vermont.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:20.000
So today we are delighted
to have Jane here

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.170
to discuss her latest
book, Daisy Turner's Kin,

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.740
An African American Family,
which has just been published

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.960
by University of Illinois Press
and, following today's talk,

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.220
Jane will be out front for
those of you who might wish

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.410
to purchase a copy or bring
the copy you already have

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.540
and have Jane sign it.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:42.920
It's really exciting.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:48.230
This is a culmination of
a life's work and focus,

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:52.470
and so we're really honored to
have Dr. Jane Beck here today

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.510
to talk about Daisy Turner.

00:04:54.510 --> 00:05:01.450
[ Applause ]

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.840
&gt;&gt; Jane Beck: Thanks, Betsy,
I don't know where you got all

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.710
that stuff from, but it's
certainly not something I gave you.

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.610
I apologize.

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.900
Now let's hope this
is all going to work.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.200
Here we go.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.300
Okay, this is Daisy Turner.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:38.380
And the fascinating thing to
me about Daisy Turner's Kin,

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:44.520
is that it's a family story
told over four generations

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:52.440
over two centuries by the
Turner's for the Turner's.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:06:00.910
And I know of no other family
story of African American descent

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:09.740
that goes from Africa to a
small town in Grafton, Vermont.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:17.820
This story was placed in a
larger context of social,

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:21.640
cultural, historical framework.

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:28.390
And the important thing to remember
about Daisy Turner is she was first

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:31.080
and foremost a storyteller,

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:36.620
and she comes out of the
West African griot tradition.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:40.020
Her grandfather was a Yoruba.

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:46.950
Griot is really the keeper of
knowledge of his community,

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:55.350
and he was a singer, a storyteller,
a historian, and a genealogist,

00:06:55.350 --> 00:07:00.530
and Daisy served all those
functions for her family.

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:03.500
Now I first heard about Daisy
Turner, I was sent a clipping

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.050
by Margaret MacArthur,
the musician and singer,

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:11.700
and she said to me, you
should go see Daisy.

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:15.780
She -- I always meant
to go collect her songs.

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:17.320
She's got a million songs.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:20.360
She's got all kinds of stories.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:24.040
And I had just -- at
that point I was working

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.040
for the Vermont Arts Council.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.940
I had done a big folk
art exhibit and I was --

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:34.680
my job was to bring the traditional
arts to the general public

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:38.310
of Vermont, and I thought,
hmm, in the clipping it said

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:40.780
that Daisy Turner was 100.

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:45.980
I thought -- and at that
point, this was 1983.

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:49.530
There are been two articles
that had come out saying

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:53.800
that Vermont was the
whitest state in the union,

00:07:53.800 --> 00:08:00.150
and here was Daisy Turner and I
thought her voice needs to be heard

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:05.450
by particularly the schoolchildren,
but other Vermonters as well.

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:08.310
So I was dying to meet her.

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:15.430
And so I said about that, and I
always looked for an introduction.

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:19.570
Well, I -- you can get an
introduction to the Governor

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:21.110
of Vermont without much trouble,

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:24.030
but I couldn't get an
introduction to Daisy.

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:28.160
And then pretty soon I
learned she had a gun

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.220
and was not afraid of using it.

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:33.690
So I decided to write her a letter.

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:38.270
And then I waited on
tenterhooks for about a week,

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:41.460
and finally called, no answer.

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:44.730
And I began to worry that
maybe her health was bad

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:50.500
and maybe she couldn't see me, or
maybe she didn't hear the phone.

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:54.680
So I called the next day and
I -- as I said, she was 100.

00:08:54.680 --> 00:09:00.280
I get this ringing hello,
and I say, Miss Turner?

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:06.420
Yes. And so I started in on
my spiel about how I wanted

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:08.080
to come see her and
yadda, yadda, yadda.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:12.220
Well, she listened for about five
seconds and turned the tables on me

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:17.460
and bellowed are you
a prejudiced woman?

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:24.300
And I was totally taken off guard
and I said, no, I don't think so.

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:26.270
And she said, well come any time.

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:30.550
I said, how about next Wednesday,
and we were off and running.

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:36.730
And I went down to see her, and
she was a marvelous storyteller.

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:40.730
She held me spellbound, but I
didn't know what I was hearing.

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:46.220
I was hearing about
Virginia, and about Africa,

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:49.860
and about New Orleans,
and then Maine.

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:54.320
And, as you know, oral history

00:09:54.320 --> 00:10:00.050
and memory are considered
notoriously unreliable,

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:02.170
but always meaningful.

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:08.620
And my job I felt was to
determine how this was meaningful.

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:15.220
Now, memory and oral history are
subjective, they're personal,

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:20.700
and often when a memory is
laid down and you return

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:25.390
to it you feel the
emotion that you once felt,

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:29.620
and this sometimes colors memories,

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:36.430
but it is also important
in understanding voice.

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:43.250
Now at the center of Daisy's
storytelling was her father.

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:47.310
And I'll just play you a brief clip

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:50.680
to show you how she brings
you right into the scene.

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:52.970 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Daisy Turner: And then on the top

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:56.120
of it all [inaudible]
terrible situation,

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:59.390
Lincoln was shot, shot dead.

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:03.860
Well then father said, as he
with his group were getting ready

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:09.380
to be mustered out, they heard my
father [inaudible] again and again,

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:12.960
he heard the [inaudible]
rode running away

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:15.460
from after shooting Lincoln.

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:19.450 position:56%
They were on the edge of
Washington ready to be mustered out.

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:24.710
And so father said what a time.

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:31.580
&gt;&gt; Jane Beck: Now her father
was a charismatic, powerful man.

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:34.330
He was a marvelous storyteller.

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:41.730
He was born in 1845 and, amazingly,
he was willing to look back.

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:46.360
Most people who had been
enslaved did not look back.

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:49.690
They wanted to look forward,
but he wanted his family

00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:52.980
to know where he had come from.

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:56.040
And so he was a fine storyteller.

00:11:56.040 --> 00:12:01.640
He was a good chronicler of events
obviously from his own point

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:07.540
of view, but his stories, the
Turner narrative are what --

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:12.380
are full of what I call
touchstone stories,

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:17.440
stories that cover pivotal events,

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:21.220
life-changing moments,
full of emotion.

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:25.600
For example, when he first
realized he was a slave,

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:29.930
or later how he killed
the overseer and was able

00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:32.680
to turn his back on slavery.

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:36.090
These were Touchstone stories.

00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:48.200
Now, his narrative begins about
1802 to 1810 when his grandmother,

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:51.720
or Daisy's great-grandmother,
who was an English woman went

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:57.360 position:56%
out to Africa on her honeymoon in
one of her father's trading vessels.

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:01.480
And Daisy always said
they went to Cape Town.

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:05.810
And I didn't understand, Cape
Town to me meant South Africa

00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:09.480
and I didn't understand
how that could be

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:14.490 position:56%
if her great-grandfather was Yoruba.

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:19.110
But what I learned was the
town behind Cape Coast Castle.

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:25.230
Cape Coast Castle was the
biggest English fort and the port

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:31.600
that the shipping guy
always sent his ships to.

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:37.690
The town behind it was Cape Town
and then things fell into place.

00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:45.010
So they -- Daisy's
great-grandmother went down --

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:54.700
downwind and here is Cape Coast
Castle, down around Accra,

00:13:54.700 --> 00:14:03.150
and somewhere around Porto Novo
[inaudible] the ship was wrecked,

00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:09.520
and it experienced
probably a tornado.

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:13.560
A tornado is the line storm that
comes before the rainy season

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.780
or after the rainy season.

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:19.600
And the family story was
the ship was wrecked,

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.950
her husband was drowned,
and she was saved

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:28.240
by an African chief's son,
who was a great swimmer.

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:30.380
And it was very important

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:34.650
that he was a swimmer,
was always underscored.

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:38.290
And you don't swim on
the coast of Benin.

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:41.730
The surf was huge.

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:47.920
There were all kinds of currents,
and then if that was not enough,

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:50.630
there were all kinds of sharks.

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:55.720
So the English woman was rescued,
but never returned to England.

00:14:55.720 --> 00:15:04.050
Instead, she had a son by her
savior and he grew up as a Yoruba

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:10.340
and became involved first in trade
and then eventually slave trading.

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:14.430
And, as Daisy said, got
too smart for his own good.

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:19.930
He was captured as a slave
himself and brought to this country

00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:23.910
in a schooner -- - a Spanish
schooner called the Phoenix

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:26.770
out of Havana, Cuba.

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:33.500
He was sold in New Orleans
to a man called John Golden.

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:38.390
And he was sold -- he always
said he was sold cheap

00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:44.970
because he was obstreperous
and didn't obey orders

00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:48.950
and caused a lot of trouble.

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:53.030
He was -- I later found
through research,

00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:55.370 position:56%
that he was probably sold illegally,

00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:58.410
and that may well have
been why he was sold cheap.

00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:03.980
But the important thing to
the family is to remember

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:06.930
that he didn't go along
with anything.

00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:08.660
He was a fighter.

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:15.100
And this was very important
within the family culture.

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:20.860
So he was sold to a man called John
Golden in Port Royal, Virginia.

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:22.740
This is about 1830.

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:30.230
Oh, yeah, 1830, and John
Golden was a sporting man.

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:35.560
And Daisy's grandfather
refused to work.

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:37.990
He was not going to be a slave.

00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:40.480
A slave was beneath him.

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:48.650
And so John Golden put him to
fighting gamecocks and to boxing.

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:57.380
And boxing, this is actually
Tom Molyneux and the Joe Cribb.

00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:00.560
Tom Molyneux was a slave boxer

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:04.300
who eventually gained his
freedom through boxing.

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:09.620
But the boxing matches
would've been between the --

00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:14.520
to enslaved men of
different plantations.

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:17.370
This was the underbelly of slavery.

00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:25.470
It was not widely known and it
was full of drinking and betting.

00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:29.930
And they say that there
was more money lost or won

00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:35.240
on these boxing matches than
on any of the horse races.

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:41.240
So Daisy's grandfather
became a local champion.

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:52.010
And I suspect that his owner, Jack
Golden, bet on all of these matches

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:56.970
because he came from a long
line of yeoman farmers,

00:17:56.970 --> 00:18:03.180
but suddenly he is able to buy 720
acres on the Rappahannock River,

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:10.930
prime land, land that only the
aristocratic plantation owners

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:12.610
could afford.

00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:17.660
And I suspect that
this money was gained

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:19.980
through betting on these matches.

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:29.530
He was also described as a man of
strong but uncultivated intellect.

00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:34.340
And that says to me, okay, he
was probably a yeoman farmer

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:38.270
with nouveau riche and was moving

00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:43.890
into the aristocratic
plantation owner's land

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:46.720
and they didn't like it much.

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:54.390 position:56%
Anyway, he -- this was his home and
Daisy's grandfather continued to box

00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:58.710
for him and he eventually ended

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:05.270
up with 2,000 acres
on the Rappahannock.

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:09.990
Whoops. Daisy's grandfather
continued to box

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:14.170
until he killed a Jamaican
in the ring,

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:17.080
and then he refused
to fight anymore.

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.870
He was still his own man.

00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:25.600 position:56%
And nothing John Golden could say
would make him fight, and he was set

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:32.470
to building a wheat barn, a rafter
fell on him and he was killed.

00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:36.990
This boxing match I think
also affected John Golden,

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:41.360
because he did something
really out of character.

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:44.450
He was a member of the
Liberty Baptist Church,

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:47.300
but up until this point
had not been active

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:49.610
in the Liberty Baptist Church.

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:57.960
And he took a group of parishioners
out of the Liberty Baptist Church

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:02.460
and founded the Bethesda
Baptist Church, which was based

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:08.260
on no selling of, no drinking
of alcoholic beverages.

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:12.790
And I think that was his penance.

00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:20.850
And he went about building
the Bethesda Baptist Church.

00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:25.380 position:56%
Now Alec was born in 1845 as I said.

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:30.920
This is where his mother's
house was, just sort of on --

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:34.630
this is the big house,
just on the outskirts.

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:40.240 position:56%
And we know this through John
Golden's will, and he mentions Rose,

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:45.060
who was Alec's mother and also
the plantation seamstress.

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:49.140
He mentions where her
cabin was in his will.

00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:56.770
She had a small house and
garden -- cabin and garden.

00:20:56.770 --> 00:21:05.360
And the mistress would come down
bringing all kinds of clothing

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:11.730
to be fitted, or Rose also
made all of the slave garments,

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:15.240
but she also made -- she
was working on a dress

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:18.930
for Zethi [assumed spelling], who
was three years older than Alec

00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:21.470
and was about to have a birthday.

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:29.170
Now Alec, at five, was playing
with both white and black children.

00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:32.990
There was no sort of
discrimination between the children

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:34.290
until they were a little older.

00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:38.250
And he suddenly began to realize
he was dressed differently.

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:43.590 position:56%
He just had a kind of smock and they
all had shoes and little ruffles

00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:46.030
on their sleeves and pants.

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:51.300
And he asked his mother why
he was dressed differently,

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:54.740
and she made him a
pair of red moccasins,

00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:58.680
and he was so proud of
those red moccasins.

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:03.380
And Daisy said used to strut
around in his red moccasins.

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:08.990
But he noticed that his mother took
them off every time a white person

00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:10.430
came down.

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:14.510
And one day he was strutting around
and Mistress Golden came down

00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:17.930
and caught him in these red
moccasins and threw them

00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:22.040
in the fire, at which Alec
went berserk, he's five.

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:25.200
He bit her, he scratched
her, he punched her.

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.980
She fell in a swoon
and was carted off.

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:34.310
But all he remembered was the
awful look in his mother's eye.

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:38.430
She just was frightened
to death that he was going

00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:41.220
to be sold off the plantation.

00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:50.350
And this obviously did not
happen, but this was the real fear.

00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:55.310
She was able to pull herself
together and finish Zethi's dress,

00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:58.780
and the next day they took
it up to the big house.

00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:05.340
And through this hall here,
which was loaded with tables

00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:10.790
of sweet meats and cookies
and all kinds of good things,

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:14.800
and they went in and they went
up this enclosed staircase.

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:16.770
Rose tried the dress on Zethi.

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:18.070
It fit fine.

00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:19.710
She called Alec to come.

00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:22.980
He was already charging down
the stairs and he went straight

00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:27.080
for a plate of ginger
soldier cookies

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:29.060
and began to bite their heads off.

00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:32.860 position:56%
So he was in trouble all over again.

00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:34.460
And this time he was punished.

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:38.030
He was punished by
a guy called Pusley.

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:40.160
Pusley was the overseer.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:42.310
And the Turners all
called him Pusley,

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:47.350
but actually his name Presley,
but I like Pusley better.

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:56.240
And so Alec was made to carry water
to the slaves that were working up

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:59.030
and down this long field.

00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:03.720
It's amazing to me that
these fields are still there.

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:06.320
He did this for two or three weeks.

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:10.860
And then went on -- he
took care of the cattle

00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:13.260
and the horses and the sheep.

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:20.250
And then he graduated again
to working in the milk house.

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:24.330
And Zethi, as I said, was
three years older than he was

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:29.060
and a great friend, and she
told him that he must get away.

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:32.550
He must get away to Vermont
where he would be free

00:24:32.550 --> 00:24:34.420
and she would help him.

00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:38.710
Now whether she was an
abolitionist or not, we don't know.

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:41.580
We know she was the
granddaughter of Golden,

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:45.030
perhaps it was a generational
gap, who knows.

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:49.500
But anyway, she was ready
to help him and she began

00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:51.310
to teach him how to read.

00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:56.690 position:56%
And it was behind the milk house
that she would bring down her primer

00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:59.660
and he began to learn how to read.

00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:06.050
One day her grandmother caught
them and sent Zethi to the house,

00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:08.590
lashed Alec with her whip.

00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:10.850
He held onto this primer
as she tries

00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:13.450 position:56%
to take it away, bled on the primer.

00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:18.420
And this primer he carried when he
eventually escaped the plantation,

00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:21.520
he carried with him
throughout the Civil War.

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:26.470
That was how important it
was for him and the signal

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:30.450
that he had been learning
how to read.

00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:35.480
Now Alec did other jobs
at -- on the plantation.

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:36.940
And one of them was
hauling [inaudible].

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:42.700
One of the things that he loved
was the spirituals that were all --

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:45.600 position:56%
the work songs that were often sung.

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:50.080
And he told his -- he taught
his children all these songs

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:52.470
and when they sang them.

00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:57.510
And so here is an example of one
he would sing while [inaudible].

00:25:57.510 --> 00:26:43.900
[ Singing ]

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:50.520
Now this is -- this is now 1862 and
Confederate soldiers were camped

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:53.010
out on the Golden property.

00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:59.280
And in the Golden house today
you can still see the stuff

00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:02.910
that they had lent to some of
the soldiers, two bed quilts,

00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:06.870
two white counterpanes,
father's blanket.

00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:12.670
It sort of brings you right
back to when Alec was there.

00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:15.230
At the same time, across
the Rappahannock,

00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:17.990
the first New Jersey
cavalry was camped out,

00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:21.990
and Ferdinand Dayton was
the assistant surgeon.

00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:25.350
And he came across the river and
Alec told his children later,

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:27.300
he didn't know what
made him so brave,

00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:29.810 position:56%
but he talked with Ferdinand Dayton.

00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:33.640
And Dayton told him when he got
together the people that wanted

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:38.730
to escape to wave white bedsheets
and he would come across,

00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:46.580
and that is how Alec escaped
and brought Captain Broderick,

00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:50.320
heard Alec talking with
another slave who had escaped

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:56.230
about some kind Confederate
outpost at the Golden plantation,

00:27:56.230 --> 00:28:02.090
actually John Golden's son, who
was right next to John Golden.

00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:08.460
And they planned a raid to cross
the river and Alec helped lead this

00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:13.270
to Tom Golden's -- to the
Chestnut Grove plantation.

00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:17.120
They captured an outpost
of eight [inaudible].

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:22.670
And while they're doing that
Alec goes half a mile away

00:28:22.670 --> 00:28:31.400
to where Pusley is living and
shoots him, and that enables him

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:33.970
to turn his back on slavery.

00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:41.480
It was the most important story
that he told over and over.

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:49.060
But it allowed him to then
turn that page and think

00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:51.530
about the rest of his life.

00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:56.530
He joined the first New Jersey
cavalry, or he worked for Dayton

00:28:56.530 --> 00:29:03.850
as an orderly and he went on a
campaign up the Shenandoah Valley

00:29:03.850 --> 00:29:08.520
and then part of the
Virginia campaign,

00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:11.350
Brandy Station, Gettysburg.

00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:18.110
And at that point Dayton
helped start

00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:20.710
up the second New Jersey cavalry,

00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:24.930
and Alec again was
to go with Dayton.

00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:34.390
What I learned was that he
had been given a furlough,

00:29:34.390 --> 00:29:39.300
and they were in Arlington
waiting for orders.

00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:46.140
The orders came through and Dayton
and his group left for Tennessee,

00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:49.160
and poor Alec was left behind.

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:52.610
The interesting thing is,
he never mentions this,

00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:55.830
or Daisy never mentioned this.

00:29:55.830 --> 00:30:00.060
She only thought he fought for
the first New Jersey cavalry.

00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:05.070
And just think how he must've
felt being left behind.

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:06.870
He probably went to City Point.

00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:09.020
It says he went to City Point.

00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:11.810
He probably worked
in a hospital there.

00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:15.960
And the interesting thing is,
he was there for over a year

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:21.650
and after the war Dayton came
back and found him, took them back

00:30:21.650 --> 00:30:25.110
to New Jersey, found him a
job, and got him enrolled in --

00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:29.130
to night school, where
Alec spent two years.

00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:33.120
Then he came back to Washington
through the Freedmen's Bureau,

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:38.720
got a job with A. H. Merrill, who
ran a slate quarry, of all places,

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:45.350
in Williamsburg, Maine, which
is really the end of the earth.

00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:52.240
And 38 ex-slaves went up and
worked in this slate quarry.

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:57.010
This is Alec right here.

00:30:57.010 --> 00:31:01.110
And when I saw this I knew
instantly it was Alec,

00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:07.140
but if you look closely
there is a watch fob there.

00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:11.150
And here he is again with
it on his wedding day.

00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:17.690
And he was a -- he used to take
men back and forth from Washington

00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:23.390
to Maine, and many of the men
could not survive the winter there.

00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:28.240
And on one of his trips
back he meets Sally Early,

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:30.750
who at that point was a girl of 14.

00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:32.250
He marries her.

00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:36.780
They have children.

00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:41.200
They have twins, and
then a third daughter,

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:45.530
and she is dying of consumption.

00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:53.680
And so Merrill gets her
a doctor down in Boston.

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:56.540
She hangs on to life.

00:31:56.540 --> 00:32:02.420
Alec got a job loading
freight at the north station.

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:07.160
And then he's scouring the
newspapers for another job

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:10.350
and finds one, of all
places, in Grafton,

00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:12.400
Vermont working for Charles White.

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:14.740
He comes up, he checks it out.

00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:18.320
They tell him Grafton
is a very healthy place,

00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:20.500
and he said a feeling just
went right through him.

00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:23.800
He knew that that was
the place for Sally.

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:31.130 position:56%
And they also told him that he would
not be able to earn enough money

00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:36.780
to put salt in his bread, and he
was determined to prove them wrong.

00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:42.170
And so he found out that all
Vermonters used 3 1/2 pound axe.

00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:48.720
He had a 4 pound axe made, and
he cut twice as much lumber.

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:55.140
His conduit into the town
was the general store.

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:59.390
And he helped unload freight,
he was a good storyteller,

00:32:59.390 --> 00:33:04.730
he was a wonderful singer, and
the men began to enjoy him.

00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:14.510
And finally one day was unloading
freight and the storekeeper, Wyman,

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:19.030
said you can have -- he
said he wanted some flour,

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:22.360
10 pounds of flour, and Wyman
said you can have that barrel

00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:24.720
if you can carry it home.

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:30.060
And Alec said you're going to
lose because I can do that.

00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:33.540
&gt;&gt; Daisy Turner: And Bill Wyman
said, if you can carry a barrel

00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:35.540
of that flour so Sally

00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:37.730
and the children [inaudible]
I'll give it to you.

00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:42.100
Well, father said, your loss
because I'll pick it up and I go.

00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:45.540
So father finally got
[inaudible] got started.

00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:50.950
So he put the barrel of flour and
he told me many a times just how

00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:54.490
to do it, just right
[inaudible] and started.

00:33:54.490 --> 00:34:01.710
When he got to the bridge,
the first bridge out there,

00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:07.340
he didn't take it all but
he chained it like that,

00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:12.200 position:56%
a little like that over, just a
little bit further, because he found

00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:14.990
that -- he knew he had to make
the hill and the barrel would have

00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:16.470
to lay a certain way there.

00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:20.310 position:56%
So he shifted it then and went home.

00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:24.980
And my father, [inaudible]
Alexander, my father,

00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:31.690
I'm proud to be your daughter, went
on up that road and up that hill

00:34:31.690 --> 00:34:35.200
and across that long field,
because we lived in the shanty,

00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:37.290
and my father never set that barrel

00:34:37.290 --> 00:34:41.220
down until he got up
in the shanty door.

00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:46.050
And there must have been at that
time 40 men all following him

00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:48.550
with [laughter] jugs of
[inaudible] cider and all.

00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:55.550
And mother told many a times
how after they all got --

00:34:55.550 --> 00:35:01.790
they all got drunk after father
set the barrel of cider down

00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:06.730
and they all was saluting
him and congratulated on him.

00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:11.170
And my father carried that barrel
of flour from Grafton Village

00:35:11.170 --> 00:35:15.700
up on our hilltop for us
children to eat, to have bread.

00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:20.960
Now that's the truth if I never
speak a word again [laughter].

00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:24.730
&gt;&gt; Jane Beck: She's quite
a storyteller, isn't she?

00:35:24.730 --> 00:35:31.020
Now Alec was -- he came to
Vermont in 1873, and by --

00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:35.640
and was known as a laborer
because he was cutting wood,

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:42.730
but by 1878 he was
considered a farmer.

00:35:42.730 --> 00:35:48.060
And what he did was he cleared
the land and then bought it cheap,

00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:51.620
and eventually build a house.

00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:59.520
And he owned by the time he
died something like 200 acres.

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:07.860
He had local help building the
house, everybody gave a day's work.

00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:15.080
He was also protected by the
town fathers, I think really

00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:21.760
from the underlying racism
in Grafton he became sort

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:26.070
of their slaves, their
way of helping.

00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:31.300
And they protected
him and eased his way.

00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:37.560
And he, once people
realized who he was,

00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:42.120
what a wonderful guy he
was, they supported him.

00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:49.330
And he was -- he became very
successful as a farmer in Grafton.

00:36:49.330 --> 00:36:54.640
And his family became
part of the community.

00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:56.660
And the kids all went to school.

00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:58.190
This is Daisy here.

00:36:58.190 --> 00:37:02.910
This is Susie, she
was a twin of Willie.

00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:06.420
Willie was kind of obstreperous.

00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:10.520
He -- they used to
-- the Turners used

00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:14.990
to sell poultry to
the Boston market.

00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:21.980
And so Sally, his mother, would be
killing chickens and he wanted --

00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:26.700
he noticed that they'd run around
after their heads were lopped off.

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:30.080
So he wanted to see if
his sister might run

00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:32.580
around with her head lopped off.

00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:35.920
So he went after her
with a 4 pound axe

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:38.660
and the mother just
got there in time.

00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:43.380 position:56%
So he was a little bit obstreperous.

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:50.050
And Alec then -- his
family began to grow

00:37:50.050 --> 00:37:54.230
and he began to have grandchildren.

00:37:54.230 --> 00:38:01.350
And the Turner hill property
really became a family seat.

00:38:01.350 --> 00:38:09.560 position:56%
And I thought I'd go through just
to give you some idea of his family.

00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:16.750
And this is one of the
oldest twin daughters, Rose.

00:38:16.750 --> 00:38:20.900
And the interesting thing
for me about Rose was

00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:27.640
that she kept an account book, not
really a diary, but she would put

00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:32.960
down important dates
in that account book.

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:42.190 position:56%
Daisy came to Boston in 1921 and
spent the night, or some such thing.

00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:51.440 position:56%
And most of the daughters, about the
time of 1890 when they began to look

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:56.660
for jobs, ended up by going
down to the Boston area.

00:38:56.660 --> 00:39:03.230
Her twin sister, Rachel, worked at
the Everett Hospital outside Boston

00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:06.410
and became a practical nurse.

00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:11.340
And Nellie was the
first to get married.

00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:15.220
Now they also went to
Boston to find husbands,

00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:17.980
because obviously the
black community

00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:20.610
in Vermont was nonexistent.

00:39:20.610 --> 00:39:23.450
And Nelly was the first to marry.

00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:29.650
That was her son you saw in
the photograph with Alec.

00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:32.920
And this is he at 21.

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:37.870
He was an outstanding
young athlete, a drummer.

00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:40.100
He was about to go to law school.

00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:46.020
He went into a race, had an
aneurysm, and died it 21,

00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:49.950
which was a real tragedy.

00:39:49.950 --> 00:39:52.800
Linsey Turner was the first son.

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:56.590
He born in 1875.

00:39:56.590 --> 00:40:00.040
And an interesting story
connected with him.

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:02.800
He had two sons out of wedlock.

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:06.290
One of these was Leslie Rogers.

00:40:06.290 --> 00:40:13.580
And about 10 years ago I got a call
from his daughter, Janet Severance,

00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:21.860
who wanted to go to Ireland and
she needed her birth certificate.

00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:27.560
And when she got her birth
certificate she discovered M,

00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:32.720
indicating her father's
race and she didn't --

00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:36.310
she was 50 and she knew
nothing about this.

00:40:36.310 --> 00:40:38.070
How would she feel?

00:40:38.070 --> 00:40:43.400 position:56%
And she went off to Ireland and sort
of got madder and madder and madder.

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:47.070
And her father was dead but
her mother was still alive

00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:50.810
so when she got back she
questioned her mother.

00:40:50.810 --> 00:40:58.190
And sure enough, her father was
Linsey's son and had been --

00:40:58.190 --> 00:41:02.310
had grown up in a white
family, the Rogers family.

00:41:02.310 --> 00:41:09.270
Her daughter, Tamara, went and
interviewed her grandmother.

00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:14.410
Her grandmother was very
uncomfortable talking about this,

00:41:14.410 --> 00:41:19.690
but Tamara was able to get her
story and it was one of racism.

00:41:19.690 --> 00:41:26.230
The family -- the mother's
family had disowned her

00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:33.560
and the community was not
always friendly to them.

00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:37.070
So Tamara collected all
these stories and told them

00:41:37.070 --> 00:41:44.850
to her siblings, and also to her
first cousin, who was the son

00:41:44.850 --> 00:41:51.960
of Janet's brother, and his
name was -- is David Rogers.

00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:55.050
And when she told him he
pulled off his hat and he said,

00:41:55.050 --> 00:41:58.430
now I know I why my hair goes
crazy when it rains [laughter].

00:41:58.430 --> 00:42:02.310 position:56%
And then he came back and he said --

00:42:02.310 --> 00:42:07.290
he began telling his
friends and they all knew.

00:42:07.290 --> 00:42:10.160
Grafton had not forgotten.

00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:15.240
It was David Rogers who we were
able to do a genome test on.

00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:21.880
He was the son of a son of a son
of a son, and it came back Yoruba,

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:26.160
confirming what Daisy had
told me, that they came

00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:29.460
from the Yoruba ethnic group.

00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:35.050
Now this is Willie, the same
one that went after his sister

00:42:35.050 --> 00:42:42.310
with the axe, and he
ended by being a sergeant.

00:42:42.310 --> 00:42:44.550
This is in World War I.

00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:52.760
He won the [inaudible] and
he was quite an amazing man.

00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:58.880
And his twin sister, who wanted
to be a missionary nurse,

00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:05.040
found she fainted at the sight
of blood, so that escaped her.

00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:10.990
But her daughter, Ronny
Lanier, became both a missionary

00:43:10.990 --> 00:43:16.910
and the first black Baptist
minister in New England,

00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:21.570
and was just a marvelous,
much beloved woman.

00:43:21.570 --> 00:43:30.580
And she -- in many ways she
encompassed Alec's strong religious

00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:33.560
underpinnings, but also
she was a great athlete

00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:39.800
and won some amazing
trophy for having something

00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:45.370
like 10 letters in high school.

00:43:45.370 --> 00:43:53.990
And her brother, Chester, won
the Golden Gloves in 1933.

00:43:53.990 --> 00:44:00.500
So you see, again, this
strain of real prowess

00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:05.120
and athleticism throughout
the Turner family.

00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:08.320
Now before -- this is Daisy,

00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:13.940
but before Daisy was born they had
an eighth son, who was known as --

00:44:13.940 --> 00:44:21.800 position:56%
who was called Alexander, but within
the family was known as Enough.

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:25.590
And sadly he died of
pneumonia at nine months,

00:44:25.590 --> 00:44:29.030
and after him they
had five more girls,

00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:31.970
Daisy being the first after him.

00:44:31.970 --> 00:44:33.270
And this is Daisy.

00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:39.060
Daisy never married, but
she had a torrid love affair

00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:43.520
with a white man called
Joseph Bonnet down in Boston.

00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:48.140
And they were supposed to
be married Christmas day

00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:53.220
and her father took ill
and she went home, he died.

00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:59.110
By the time she came back she
discovered that this guy had been

00:44:59.110 --> 00:45:07.730
with another woman, so she
brought suit for breach of promise,

00:45:07.730 --> 00:45:10.980
a black woman against a white man.

00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:14.890
Now don't think a white woman
had much of a prayer in hell

00:45:14.890 --> 00:45:18.200
of winning against a white man.

00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:23.810
And she had the, what do
you call it, the jurors,

00:45:23.810 --> 00:45:26.930
12 white men were jurors.

00:45:26.930 --> 00:45:36.590
She won a settlement
of $3,500 -- $3,550.

00:45:36.590 --> 00:45:39.250
And there's a wonderful
photograph of her

00:45:39.250 --> 00:45:47.330
in the Boston paper saying,
I have been vindicated.

00:45:47.330 --> 00:45:50.250
So she was tough.

00:45:50.250 --> 00:45:55.500
Violet was the first to
marry a white man, and Alec,

00:45:55.500 --> 00:46:00.120
because of slavery, did not
think that that was a good idea.

00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:04.400
And indeed she had
a hard time of it.

00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:15.470
George died early, but in the
meantime he had his dose of racism.

00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:23.800
This card was sent
and Godfrey, his son,

00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:30.010
kept this all his life
as a stark reminder.

00:46:30.010 --> 00:46:37.550
And this is Godfrey, who -- this
was his last walk up Turner Hill.

00:46:37.550 --> 00:46:42.620
He is 88 and every tree,
every stone had a story.

00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:45.150 position:56%
And I felt, as I walked up with him,

00:46:45.150 --> 00:46:51.770
I was suddenly inhabiting
the Turner family legacy.

00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:58.040
Zebbe was named after
Zethi, the little girl

00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:01.000
that taught Alec how to read.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:09.180
And she was the first daughter
born in the new house in Vermont.

00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:14.970
And Evelyn again married a white
man, a Swede, Dave Carlson.

00:47:14.970 --> 00:47:23.400
And Violet also she
married an Italian, Antonio,

00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:30.620
and this is Sally here with
one of her famous hands.

00:47:31.850 --> 00:47:39.380
And here is -- the place really
became a family homestead.

00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:44.570
The daughters came every summer
for as long as they could.

00:47:44.570 --> 00:47:51.760
The only one that didn't come
really was Willie, who was working

00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:54.480
down in New York, and
then eventually

00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:57.900
in South America for
the Swift Company.

00:47:57.900 --> 00:48:03.200
But it was totally a family place.

00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:09.300
And here Alec lived for
50 years, Sally for 60.

00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:14.530
She recovered within the first
year of being in Vermont.

00:48:14.530 --> 00:48:23.210
And so two slaves who never could
have dreamed of this felt --

00:48:23.210 --> 00:48:31.660
Alec always said that he had
been led to Grafton, Vermont.

00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:40.680
And Daisy, who kept this story, and
was such a marvelous storyteller,

00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:47.520
knew that the only way that
the story would survive was

00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:49.230
to have it in print.

00:48:49.230 --> 00:48:53.220
That basically ours
is a literate society,

00:48:53.220 --> 00:48:57.550
and so she began asking
me to write it.

00:48:57.550 --> 00:49:02.250
And I wasn't at all sure I
was the right person to do it.

00:49:02.250 --> 00:49:04.590
I wasn't particularly a good writer

00:49:04.590 --> 00:49:10.530
and I thought maybe an
African American should do it,

00:49:10.530 --> 00:49:14.800
but eventually I came round.

00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:19.350
But I said, which she
didn't believe.

00:49:19.350 --> 00:49:26.730
I think we've got to put, you
know, a larger framework behind it,

00:49:26.730 --> 00:49:30.630
and I did promise her
that I would do this.

00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:34.290
But at that point I was
working, I didn't have time.

00:49:34.290 --> 00:49:38.850
But I felt that the only way
her story really would be taken

00:49:38.850 --> 00:49:45.220
seriously was to document as much
of it as could be documented.

00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:49.510
And what I found was
that the stories ended

00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:57.310
up by being almost flag
posts to historical events.

00:49:57.310 --> 00:50:06.440
And so her story, this
really vibrant family story,

00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:12.490
with a distinct voice
about a critical time

00:50:12.490 --> 00:50:20.040
in our American history
has been preserved thanks

00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:25.380 position:56%
to Daisy's ability as a storyteller.

00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:30.960
And here is one last photograph
of Daisy on her 104 birthday.

00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:33.250
I thought she was going
to live forever.

00:50:33.250 --> 00:50:38.460
She recited on that birthday a
poem that went on for 20 minutes.

00:50:38.460 --> 00:50:41.090
She was just plain amazing.

00:50:41.090 --> 00:50:42.890

&gt;&gt; Well, [inaudible] ancestry.com
that people are finding

00:51:00.490 --> 00:51:02.700
out that more and more
people who thought

00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:05.460
that they were white
in fact are not.

00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:12.920
As a matter of fact I think I read
something that said the majority

00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:16.470
of white Americas have
African American blood in them.

00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:18.670
And the second thing is
that there is another family

00:51:18.670 --> 00:51:21.430
that can trace its
ancestry back to Africa,

00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:22.800
and those are the [inaudible].

00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:24.100

and then the family took it over

and so you'll see in [inaudible] and
they all trace their genealogy back

00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:43.650 position:56%
to [inaudible] Jamestown and they
and they have an unbroken history --

00:51:43.650 --> 00:51:44.950
&gt;&gt; Jane Beck: Wow.

00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:46.250
&gt;&gt; Of family from Africa.

00:51:46.250 --> 00:51:47.550

be the family genealogist.

00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:56.010
&gt;&gt; Jane Beck: Neat, thank you.

00:51:56.010 --> 00:51:58.670
I might add that the
Turner family that is left

00:51:58.670 --> 00:52:01.290
in Grafton is totally white.

00:52:01.290 --> 00:52:05.960
The ones that went to Boston
are African American which --

00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:07.260
&gt;&gt; Just -- I just wanted

00:52:07.260 --> 00:52:09.280
to [inaudible] interesting
thing happened to me

00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:11.130
at the Book Festival this year.

00:52:11.130 --> 00:52:15.970
I was in the History Pavillion and
somebody walked up to me and said,

00:52:15.970 --> 00:52:17.560
oh I have Ferguson's [assumed
spelling] in my family

00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:19.200
and it was a white woman.

00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:21.580
And I said, oh, where
are your Fergusons from?

00:52:21.580 --> 00:52:23.210
She said South Carolina.

00:52:23.210 --> 00:52:25.480
And I said so are my Fergusons.

00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:26.780
And it went on.

00:52:26.780 --> 00:52:28.600
And she said what part
of South Carolina.

00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:31.300
I said Orangeburg, and she said
so are my Fergusons [laughter].

00:52:31.300 --> 00:52:35.540
And then she said my Fergusons
were [inaudible] Presbyterian --

00:52:35.540 --> 00:52:38.550
or Scottish Methodist ministers.

00:52:38.550 --> 00:52:42.200
And I said my Fergusons were
all [inaudible] ministers.

00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:46.190
So we concluded at that point that
we had in fact found the white

00:52:46.190 --> 00:52:47.790 position:56%
and black Fergusons who [inaudible].

00:52:47.790 --> 00:52:50.090

&gt;&gt; Jane Beck: I did
with the plantation.

00:55:03.050 --> 00:55:08.900
I found the plantation and
the guy that owned it was --

00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:12.530
had done some archaeological stuff.

00:55:12.530 --> 00:55:16.680
And I knew where the graveyard was.

00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:23.990
I was dying to get him to dig,
you know, where Rose's cabin was.

00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:30.530
I was given the line of that
from the will of John Golden.

00:55:30.530 --> 00:55:38.780
But, you know, I didn't do a
lot of archaeological stuff.

00:55:38.780 --> 00:55:43.850
I wished I could've done -- I mean
I was -- it was private property.

00:55:43.850 --> 00:55:48.600
I would have, you know,
loved to have done more

00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:50.820
on the Golden plantation.

00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:53.210

00:55:53.210 --> 00:55:58.520
&gt;&gt; Did any of the next
generation continue stories?

&gt;&gt; Jane Beck: Yes, the
grandchildren all knew.

00:56:04.390 --> 00:56:08.180
In fact, in the -- in the book --

00:56:08.180 --> 00:56:11.110
at one point I was just
going to use Daisy's voice,

00:56:11.110 --> 00:56:14.250
and then I decided I
should use a family voice,

00:56:14.250 --> 00:56:18.980
and the family voice incorporates
many of the grandchildren.

00:56:18.980 --> 00:56:24.600
For example, some of the oldest
grandsons were attracted to Alec

00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:28.600
as a young boy on the plantation,
and they retained much more

00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:31.070
than Daisy did, who
didn't really care

00:56:31.070 --> 00:56:33.940
about being a young
boy on a plantation.

00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:40.030
And so they had more stories
about that than Daisy did.

00:56:40.030 --> 00:56:45.160
And they all said that his most
important story was shooting the

00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:49.850
overseer, and this was something he
told over and over and over again.

00:57:44.790 --> 00:57:55.400
But, you know, his name was Presley
and the records of overseers,

00:57:55.400 --> 00:57:57.460
you know, it's every 10 years.

00:57:57.460 --> 00:58:00.780
So I don't -- and there
was some discussion

00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:04.460 position:56%
as to whether he was black or white.

00:58:04.460 --> 00:58:09.580
And there was a slave
called Presley that worked

00:58:09.580 --> 00:58:13.420
for Jack Golden's father,
was this the Presley?

00:58:13.420 --> 00:58:16.320
I don't know.

00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:18.990
That's certainly a question.

00:58:18.990 --> 00:58:21.240
&gt;&gt; One more question.

00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:23.090
&gt;&gt; Jane Beck: Yes, yes?

00:58:23.090 --> 00:58:35.000 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Can you discuss any of the
research or [inaudible] to the next?

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:37.480
&gt;&gt; Jane Beck: Got mixed up?

00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:41.370 position:56%
Yes, I'll give you one good example.

00:58:41.370 --> 00:58:47.270
And that is the story Daisy
told about her grandmother,

00:58:47.270 --> 00:58:53.260
who was a Cherokee, full-blooded
Cherokee and her grandfather.

00:58:53.260 --> 00:59:01.290
They -- supposedly her grandfather
went with Golden to a place

00:59:01.290 --> 00:59:07.030
where North, South Carolina
and Georgia all come together,

00:59:07.030 --> 00:59:11.750
which is a Cherokee reservation.

00:59:11.750 --> 00:59:22.530
And Rose supposedly went and
saw him box, they fell in love,

00:59:22.530 --> 00:59:29.150
and Golden allowed Daisy's
grandfather to get married

00:59:29.150 --> 00:59:33.550 position:56%
in the Cherokee tradition, whatever
that was, and then carried them back

00:59:33.550 --> 00:59:38.380
by cart to the Golden plantation.

00:59:38.380 --> 00:59:42.440
And so I thought, you know,
I went down to Cherokee.

00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:48.740
I was trying to figure out
how Daisy's grandfather,

00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:50.740
who he would've fought down there.

00:59:50.740 --> 00:59:53.470
There were not plantations there.

00:59:53.470 --> 01:00:04.960
And then I came across a court
case, and it told me that Rose,

01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:10.190
and it only refers to her as black,

01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:16.140
and yet the family Alec always
said she was full-blooded Cherokee,

01:00:16.140 --> 01:00:21.590
so I believe that, but
that Rose had been owned

01:00:21.590 --> 01:00:22.890
by this guy called Miku
[assumed spelling],

01:00:22.890 --> 01:00:26.090
who was moving to Mississippi.

01:00:26.090 --> 01:00:34.390
And she had a bad hip, and he
sold her to Jack Golden, who came

01:00:34.390 --> 01:00:36.990
and said I have her husband.

01:00:36.990 --> 01:00:41.030
And Rose at that point had
her first child, George,

01:00:41.030 --> 01:00:44.600
who was Alec's older
brother by 10 years.

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:51.490
So there was documentation
of the sale in 1835.

01:00:51.490 --> 01:00:58.600
So what had happened was, two
stories I think had been collapsed.

01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:05.220
I think Rose came from where
North and South Carolina

01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:13.000
and Georgia all come together, but
how she was enslaved I don't know.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:23.550
And that is a good example of
mixing up over generations.

01:01:23.550 --> 01:01:25.410
Okay.

01:01:25.410 --> 01:01:27.160
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:32.400
&gt;&gt; Jane Beck: Thank you [applause].

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:36.100
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
