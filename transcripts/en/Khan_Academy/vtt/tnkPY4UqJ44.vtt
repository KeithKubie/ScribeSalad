00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.640
Divide and write the answer
as a mixed number.

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.770
And we have 3/5 divided
by 1/2.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.220
Now, whenever you're dividing
any fractions, you just have

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.200
to remember that dividing by a
fraction is the same thing as

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.970
multiplying by its reciprocal.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.810
So this thing right here is the
same thing as 3/5 times--

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.780
so this is our 3/5 right here,
and instead of a division

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.120
sign, you want a multiplication
sign, and

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.880
instead of a 1/2, you want to
take the reciprocal of 1/2,

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.510
which would be 2/1--
so times 2/1.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.770
So dividing by 1/2 is the
exact same thing as

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.360
multiplying by 2/1.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.000
And we just do this as a
straightforward multiplication

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.080
problem now.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.840
3 times 2 is 6, so our
new numerator is 6.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.950
5 times 1 is 5.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.360
So 3/5 divided by 1/2 as an
improper fraction is 6/5.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.220
Now, they want us to write
it as at mixed number.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.450
So we divide the 5 into
the 6, figure out how

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:05.300
many times it goes.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.530
That'll be the whole number
part of the mixed number.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.290
And then whatever's left over
will be the remaining

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.620
numerator over 5.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.160
So what we'll do is
take 5 into 6.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.600
5 goes into 6 one time.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.700
1 times 5 is 5.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.360
Subtract.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.960
You have a remainder of 1.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:34.460
So 6/5 is equal to one whole,
or 5/5, and 1/5.

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.610
This 1 comes from whatever
is left over.

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:43.630
And now we're done!

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.730
3/5 divided by 1/2
is 1 and 1/5.

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.350
Now, the one thing that's not
obvious is why did this work?

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.660
Why is dividing by 1/2 the
same thing as multiplying

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:54.880
essentially by 2.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.000
2/1 is the same thing as 2.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.890
And to do that, I'll do a little
side-- fairly simple--

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.870
example, but hopefully, it
gets the point across.

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.910
Let me take four objects.

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.850
So we have four objects:
one, two, three, four.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.790
So I have four objects, and if
I were to divide into groups

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.300
of two, so I want to divide
it into groups of two.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.210
So that is one group of two and
then that is another group

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.600
of two, how many groups
do I have?

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.400
Well, 4 divided by 2, I have two
groups of two, so that is

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.900
equal to 2.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.460
Now, what if I took those
same four objects:

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.990
one, two, three, four.

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.160
So I'm taking those
same four objects.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.890
Instead of dividing them into
groups of two, I want to

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.610
divide them into groups of 1/2,
which means each group

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.080
will have half of
an object in it.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.960
So let's say that would be
one group right there.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.900
That is a second group.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.140
That is a third group.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.690
I think you see each group has
half of a circle in it.

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.280
That is the fourth.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.070
That's the fifth.

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:01.390
That's the sixth.

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.790
That's the seventh, and then
that's the eighth.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.660
You have eight groups of 1/2,
so this is equal to 8.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.920
And notice, now each of the
objects became two groups.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.660
So you could say how many
groups do you have?

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.860
Well, you have four objects
and each of

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.290
them became two groups.

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:22.270
I'm looking for a
different color.

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.520
Each of them became
two groups, and so

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.840
you also have eight.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.710
So dividing by 1/2 is the same
thing as multiplying by 2.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.250
And you could think about it
with other numbers, but

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.020
hopefully, that gives you a
little bit of an intuition.
