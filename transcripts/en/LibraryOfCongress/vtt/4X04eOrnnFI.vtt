00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:03.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.360
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Hello.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.660
My name is Nancy Groce.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.300
I'm a folklorist at the American
Folklife Center here at the Library

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.950 position:56%
of Congress, and I'd like to welcome
you to the latest presentation

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.960
on our ongoing Benjamin
A. Botkin Lecture Series.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.980
The Botkin Series allows
us to highlight the work

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.300
of leading scholars in the
discipline of folklore,

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.320
ethnomusicology, oral history

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.230
and cultural heritage while
enhancing the collections here

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.110
at the American Folklife Center.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.370
For the Center and the Library,

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.780
the Botkin Lecture has
formed an important facet

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.320
of acquisition activities.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.920
Each lecture is videotaped
and becomes part

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.360
of a permanent collection.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.360
In addition, the lectures
are later posted as webcasts

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.620
on the Library's website where
they are available for viewing

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.890
to Internet patrons
throughout the world.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.950
So, if you haven't already done
so, now would be an excellent time

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.110
to turn off any electronic
devices you have with you.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.220
Very often the American
Folklife Center partners

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.620
with other divisions here at
the Library of Congress to put

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.140
on lectures and concerts, and
today I am delighted to say

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.310
that this event is
being co-sponsored

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.960
by the John W. Kluge Center, and
I want to thank the Kluge Center

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.060
for their help and
support in this project.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.800
One of the great joys as working as
a folklorist is the enormous scope

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.040
of topics that folklorists
are encouraged to study.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.830 position:56%
Although folklorists might be better
known for their research in music

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.810
and legends, myths and
customs and material culture,

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.350
many folklorists are also
involved in setting traditions

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.890
and practices surrounding food,
food preparation and preservation

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.640
and the use of food in
rituals and celebration.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.010
The American Folklife Center
archive contains an enormous amount

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:08.880
of materials about food and
food-related traditions,

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.790
and I welcome you all to come
and do research in our holdings.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.090
Today I have the pleasure

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.920 position:56%
of introducing folklorist Danille
Elise Christensen, who the last year

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.680
or so as a Kluge Fellow has
been here at the Library

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.160
and using the resources of the
American Folklife Center as well

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:34.570
as a holdings of numerous other
divisions to study [no audio]

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.700
which will be addressed
in today's talk.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.430
Dr. Christensen received her PhD
in Folklore from Indiana University

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.500
and is an assistant [no
audio] Virginia Tech.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.000
Her work focuses on ways people
shape everyday speech, actions

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.630
and the objects they seek to
influence and persuade others.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:04.180
She's especially interested in
gendered domestic labor as a side

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.150
of commentary and display.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.130 position:56%
In 2015, she was awarded the
prestigious John W. Kluge Fellowship

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.310 position:56%
by the Library of Congress and
she's presently completing her book,

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.250
"Freedom from Want: Home Canning
in the American Imagination,"

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.520 position:56%
which is based on her Kluge project.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.220
Today, she'll be speaking on home
canning, cultural narratives,

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.300
technological change and the
status of traditional knowledge.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.510
I'd ask you to join me in
welcoming her: Dr. Christensen.

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:44.100
[ Applause ]

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.730
&gt;&gt; Danille Christensen: Hello,
it's good to see so many friends

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.720
out there, and thank you for giving
up your lunch hour, and I apologize

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.810
in advance for talking about
food during the lunch hour

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.620
that you're giving up.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.730
[Laughter] My topic
today is home canning.

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.330
That is the preserving of heat
sterilized fruit, vegetables

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.270
and meat in sealed containers.

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.250
I'm interested in the technologies
involved, in the artifacts

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.540 position:56%
and processes that turn perishable
matter into stuff that can be stored

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.780
and exchanged according
to human desires,

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.460
but I want to also know how
technology -- excuse me --

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.810
I want to know how technologies
themselves in the societies

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.050
in which they are apart
are shaped by talk.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:23.250
So, in a moment, I'm going to
share some of the narratives

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.620
that circle around home canning.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.380 position:56%
What kinds of values and agendas has
canning been connected with and how?

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.390
Who is telling these
stories and why?

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.370
What kinds of power
relationships emerge?

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.480
Are there good guys and bad guys?

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.190
And how do changes in technology

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.260
and other material context affect
how these stories play out?

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.920
I'll spend some time sharing an
overview of cultural narratives

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.140
that emerge in materials
from the Library of Congress,

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.180
and then I'll shift into two
narratives about progress

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.040
and authoritative knowledge that
tend to erase women's roles.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.980
First though let me share
my appreciation for everyone

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.680
who has made my time here at the
Library of Congress so amazing.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.200
I've been here since February and,
unfortunately, I am headed back

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.180
to Blacksburg in 2 weeks.

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.250
I'm glad to be going back
to Blacksburg but sad

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.570
to be leaving the Library.

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.550
So to my Kluge colleagues who
are still in the United States

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.710
and made the trek over from our
offices in the Jefferson Building,

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.950
thanks for the conversation,
commiseration and willingness

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.530
to act excited over small
scholarly breakthroughs.

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.710
The Kluge staff also have my
gratitude for their support,

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.850
problem solving, ability to
procure European chocolate

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:33.240
and general good will.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.440
[Laughter] Nancy Groce and others

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.460
at the American Folklife
Center did the leg work

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.740
for this Botkin Lecture,
which is one small part

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.680
of the regular programming.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.890
My current work in
progress, as Nancy mentioned,

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:47.790 position:56%
is a book called "Freedom From Want:

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:49.740
Home Canning in the
American Imagination,"

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.090
and it got its start here at
the Library of Congress in 2012

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.950
when I was privileged to
receive a Parsons Fellowship.

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:58.100
During the two summers I
spent doing concentrated work

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.370
in the American Folklife Center
reading room, I read field notes,

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:05.020 position:56%
examined photographs and transcribed
interviews about food preservation

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.670
in the mountains of North
Carolina and Virginia

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:10.160
and West Virginia's Coal River
Valley, on ranches in Nevada,

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.370
and among immigrant families
in the American West.

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:19.140
My folklore colleagues here at the
Library offered invaluable help

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:22.300
and encouragement over those years

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.840
and the collections themselves
helped me understand how home

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:29.170
bottling traditions fit into a
matrix of preservation activities.

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:31.590
The Blue Ridge and Coal River
collections, for example,

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.560
demonstrate a range of
dehydration practices that continue

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:39.030
because they make sense in terms
of local tastes, social structures,

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:42.260
built environments and
values, such as reluctance

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.740
to be completely dependent
on electricity.

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.350
So there's J.A. Easter
and his technology.

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:52.580
Here's Carrie Severt .

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:58.210
Her, this image and her
interviews and things

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:01.400
in the collection demonstrate how
some technologies are dependent

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:05.150
on others such as her drying
rack and wood stove combination.

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:10.320
The drying rack is not too
useful without the stove.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.910
And I don't have a photo of
anyone using a car dashboard

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:17.510 position:56%
as a drying rack, but that's another
strategy that's very efficient.

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:21.330
Here's Maisy Beamer
of Galax, Virginia,

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:23.490
who noted that people dry
food on glass in the sun

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:25.270
if they don't have space inside.

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:28.150
A roof she said will dry food
in a hurry when it's a hot day.

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:30.090
In fact, she had gotten tired
of eating the fresh beans

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:32.190
in her refrigerator
and put some out to dry

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:34.610
on her cellar roof the day
folklorist Jerry Johnson stopped

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:35.910
to talk with her.

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:38.060
And I'll be showing lots
of photographs today.

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:42.920 position:56%
I spent at last two months in prints
and photographs and then two months

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:46.790
in Folklife and so I
wanted to showcase some

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:50.110
of the really great
resources that we have here.

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:54.150
Here's one last photo
from the AFC collections.

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:56.010 position:56%
This is from the Coal River Project.

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:59.050
Here is an example of "leather
britches beans" strung on thread

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:01.110
and hung from porch
beams or rafters.

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:02.600
The pods take four or five days

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:04.990
to dry outside unless
it is rainy or damp.

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:07.400
When the weather turns, you've
got to bring them inside.

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:11.020
The drying beans look pretty
in rafters and porch railings.

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:14.050
Like chili ristras in New Mexico
strung leather britches act

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:18.680 position:56%
as a visual symbol of shared culture
within Appalachian communities.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.700
I also spent a lot
of time, as I said.

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:22.000
in Prints and Photographs.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.350 position:56%
The staff there took me hostage for
two months always finding new things

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:27.520
for me to look at, and I'm
really grateful, thank you.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:30.450
I see you in the back row.

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:33.100
You'll see plenty of examples
throughout the presentation,

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:35.840
and I did finally make it to
Rare Books and Manuscripts,

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:38.940
so thanks to Michael North, Maphon
Ashman, Stephanie and others

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:44.370
who helped me track down the books
I needed including this book,

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:46.340
Ann Mary Dutton's book from 1800.

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:50.560
In 18th Century and 19th
Century English language sources,

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:53.130
they make clear distinctions
between the words "to preserve,"

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:54.690
which means to use sugar, right?

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:57.540
"To pickle," which means to
use a salt brine or vinegar.

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:01.200
And "to keep," which means to
maintain for a relatively long time

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:05.790
and relative means like
until Christmas or all winter

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:10.190
or the next year without the use
of a taste-altering preservative.

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:15.630
So that distinction and we often
think about as being just part

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:18.560
of contemporary canning where you
don't add sugar and things, right?

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:22.450
You can find it in these
older books as well.

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:26.990
This so called "cold water method"
to keep barberries that's up here,

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:30.350
that was still being advocated
in 1919 to preserve rhubarb,

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:35.130
cranberries, gooseberries and sour
cherries although the 1919 author,

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:37.940
Olive Hayes, noted in italics that,

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:40.590
"this method is not
always successful

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:43.530
as the acid content varies with
the ripeness and the locality

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:45.040
in which the fruits are grown."

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:49.550
I'll come back to her concern
with context a little bit later.

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:54.960
Also in Rare Books, I found this
British bill-of-fare published

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:58.740 position:56%
in 1708 which called for February
meals that included peas, asparagus,

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:01.200
strawberries and cream,
several apple pies,

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.440
raspberry cream and
gooseberry tarts.

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:06.190
Some of the fruit had probably
been over-wintered in cool cellars

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:07.780
or forced early in greenhouses.

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:11.040
The menus were created
by Henry Howard,

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.530
who was a well-regarded
chef employed

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:14.170
by several members of aristocracy.

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:16.590
So he would have had
access to hot houses,

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:18.640
but the gooseberry tarts were
possible because at least

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:23.080
by the late 1680s people knew
how to store firm, whole, firm,

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:26.110
acidic fruits including
gooseberries, currants, cherries,

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:29.820
bases and damsons in
sealed bottles and jars.

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:33.050
And basses and damsons like
plums belong to the genus prunus

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:38.180
but are smaller, drier and tarter
than their sweet, meaty cousins.

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:42.710
This book, which included the
menus, was first published in 1703.

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:46.130
By 1726 the book had gone
into a fifth printing.

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:50.000
A recipe Howard calls "to keep
gooseberries" appeared unchanged

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.810
in the second edition and fifth
printing and exactly as it appears

00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:58.040
in the original 1703 book as well.

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:01.540
As you'll see, the recipe relies on
two, the two procedures fundamental

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:03.310
to what we now call canning.

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:06.960
First, existing detrimental yeast,
mold and bacteria are killed

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.550
or retarded through the
application of heat.

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:11.850
And second, further
contamination is minimized

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:14.460
by sealing the container,
by stopping [inaudible].

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:19.350
Notice that he actually calls
for clarified mutton fat

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:22.160
to be used to seal the damsons.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:27.130
And what's interesting, so, in
the preface to this book he talks

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:28.430
about the different kind

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:30.550
of manuscript sources
that these come from.

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:34.940
All right, so finally, I'm indebted
to Allison Kelly and Connie Carter

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:38.050
in the Library Science
Technology and Business Division,

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:41.090
who have loaned me their
personal books, offered me snacks

00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:44.690
and sent me relevant materials
over the past four years.

00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:48.610
And actually the other day Connie
just gave me this replica Ball Jar,

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:49.980
so I brought it to show you.

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:53.510
In the stacks, I discovered more
than I thought I needed to know

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:57.420
about 19th Century
technologies like this wax sealer.

00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:04.700
And I also learned how fluid food
preservation processes in terms

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:06.220
for the turn of the century.

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:09.450
So, at the Third Annual
Lake Placid Conference

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:14.910
on Home Economics this
is Mrs. Melvil Dewey.

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:18.990
Annie Dewey who was the
wife of Melvil Dewey

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:20.290
of Dewey Decimal fame, right?

00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:24.130
And so she is setting out
sort of a schema of how

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:26.380
to organize preservation.

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:30.300
She's actually part of a
larger home economic section

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:31.610
of the Dewey Decimal System.

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:35.780
And I have found recipes for
preserving food with borax.

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:38.600
So that's not a mistake,

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:42.960
but the organizational scheme is a
little fuzzy to me here, you know,

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:48.120
boiling and sterilization can
overlap so there's sort of coming

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:53.880
to clarify those terms,
I guess, for themselves.

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:57.100
I also accumulated a
lot of food safety texts

00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:58.650
and food science and technology.

00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:00.670
And so I think this is as
good a time as any to go

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:05.190
over a few food safety
principles that would be useful

00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:07.830
in understanding the rest of
the conversation today, right?

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:12.200
So, first you need to kill
or disable existing microbes.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.410
You can do that through
sterilization,

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:17.190
high temps over sufficient
enough time.

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:20.730
You can also add sugar
or salt or acid

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:23.600
or you can dehydrate
things for desiccation.

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.770
Once you have sort of
disabled the microbes,

00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:27.690
you need to keep the
microbes out so you need

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:29.210
to have some sort of a seal, right?

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:31.280
So that's sort of the base of
parameters we're working within.

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:36.820
And you can see that in this
1876 set of instructions

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:41.640
where you take cold fruit and
put hot syrup and put into a jar

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:44.860
and place the open jar in a
boiler lined with a grate, pebbles

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:46.980
and straw to sort of
protect it from breakage.

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:52.360
You fill it up with water to the
neck, you cover the boiler and boil

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:56.760
for a specific amount of time
depending on what you're cooking.

00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:59.720
You remove it and let the
jar stand for five minutes

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:05.540 position:56%
and then you add a rubber ring and a
cap and screw it down with a wrench

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:10.130
because this is a zinc cap that you
have to really put a lot of effort

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:14.340 position:56%
in to getting it down there, but you
can see this is a little problematic

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:17.380
because it doesn't add the seal

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:19.750
until after the sterilization
has already processed, right?

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:24.870
So you've got a chance for
contamination to occur.

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:27.740
So, again, you need to
it in that order, right?

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:31.540
First you sort of cover
it, you sterilize it,

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:33.270
and then you make sure
that it's sealed.

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:34.780
Air tight.

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:38.700
Okay. So the last acknowledgement I
want to give is to Benjamin Botkin

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:40.770
for whom this lecture
series is named.

00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:44.120
He is shown here in this Victory
Garden during World War II.

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:45.420
Botkin championed the notion

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:48.930
that vernacular expressive culture
is always relevant to contemporary,

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:50.690
social and political life.

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:52.550
The pattern of things people say,

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:57.580
do and make in everyday life are
not merely practical or decorative,

00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:01.180
but in fact, they shape
structures of power.

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:03.550 position:56%
And home canning is a case in point.

00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:06.440
Shelf stable canned goods have been
a part of everyday American life

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:08.310
since the mid-19th Century.

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:12.490 position:56%
Where industrial canning utilized
metal tins and mechanized processes,

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:15.190
other forms of canning came
to rely on glass bottles

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:17.320
and the domestic labor of women.

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:21.090
I should reiterate that in the
United States home canning has come

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:23.200
to refer almost exclusively
to preserving fruit

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:27.460
and vegetables in air tight jars.

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:30.420
In the literature, it's not
unusual to hear people talk

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:34.280
about glass cans, right, when
they're referring to jars.

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:37.070
Of course the job has not
fallen exclusively to women.

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:39.190
So here you see this couple
from New Mexico working

00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:44.040
on currants and apricots.

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:46.310
That said, the story of
canning is complicated, right?

00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:49.680
Even in the early 1900s the
practice had multiple meanings.

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:52.710
For some, home canning was
old-fashioned, inefficient

00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:56.800
or embarrassing already
by like the early 1900s.

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:59.940
For others is a valuable skill
to be displayed in public

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:02.890
and mobilized in times of need.

00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:06.770
In today's context of economic
instability, automated systems

00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:09.030
and cultural and environmental
change,

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:12.700
do- it-yourself canning
is experiencing a revival.

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:15.150
More people are canning
their own food.

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:18.190
The process can be a way to
recall people and places;

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:22.320
to confirm authentic or esoteric
taste; and to enact abstract values

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:25.110
such as stewardship
or self-sufficiency.

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:28.150
That is a vernacular process
like canning becomes instrumental

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:31.740
in articulating and further
materializing ideographs:

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:34.720
Those seemingly self-evident
words and phrases that,

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:38.490
"function as guides,
warrants, reasons or excuses

00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:39.790
for behavior and belief".

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:41.590
And that's Michael McGee.

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:47.020
These one term sums of an
orientation include things

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:52.060
like tradition, heritage,
authenticity, art, identity,

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:54.410
but also a number of
key words and code words

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:57.800
that index broader cultural
narratives and ideologies.

00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.720
I'll show you a few examples.

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:04.430
So, one cultural narrative
or sort of ideograph

00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:08.190
that indexes these larger
cultural narratives is creativity.

00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:12.940
These images, one from 2011
and the other from the 1940s,

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:15.730
demonstrate how canning can be
an expressive creative practice;

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:17.560
not merely a practical one.

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:21.030
People often think of canning in
the past as people just did it

00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:23.770
because they had to but we do
it now because we choose to,

00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:29.210 position:56%
but that's not an accurate depiction
of what, from what I have found

00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:30.930 position:56%
of people's motivations for canning.

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:33.980
Beauty has always been something

00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:36.500
that people have been
interested in and sought after.

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:40.710
I'm going to show you a
range of photos that sort

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:43.520
of emphasize how home canning
can be a sign of display.

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:48.320
So here you have Mrs. Frank Jacobs,
who is carefully placing pears

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:51.700
in a jar and that has a
practical effect of making sure

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:53.710
that you got it closed
in efficient pack, right?

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:56.880
It seems to be floating up.

00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:02.460 position:56%
But it's also aesthetically pleasing
especially in terms of evenness

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:08.850
and regularity, which is often
valued by people who can.

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:14.300
Here's another sort of
sense of canning as display.

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:20.190
You can't see the sign very well
right here, but it's actually sort

00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:22.410
of a call for people
to contribute exhibits,

00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:24.860
sort of a rotating exhibit.

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:28.370
Each of these has the name
of the woman who made it.

00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:32.980
Some of them I have been able
to read with magnification,

00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:36.930
but this display is
interesting in that it sort

00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:39.190
of brings together
national security--

00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:41.400
which I'll get to in a
moment because it's part

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:45.240
of a World War I era display--

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:48.550
but it's also a chance in
this public venue, right,

00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:53.510
the Library for women to
display their handiwork.

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:58.030
And here we have the
Gonzales County Fair.

00:18:58.030 --> 00:19:02.630
I should say that display is not
incidental among many canners.

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:07.270
It may actually affect the
procedures that they employ.

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:11.280
One Illinois bacteriologist noted
in 1935 that taste, texture,

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:14.240
color and arrangement of jarred
foods are one thing when it comes

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.670
to earning social recognition
at the county fair,

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:19.630 position:56%
but concern about public health
risks should trump other performance

00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:21.050
agendas, he thought.

00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:23.940
He railed against housewives
and their ill-informed teachers

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:26.540
who use unsafe procedures
in the name of display.

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:29.820
Numerous books, he observed,
caution that "temperatures higher

00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:32.590
than boiling tend to
injure the delicate color

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:34.760
and texture of most fruits".

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:38.160
In an attempt to preserve flavor
and yet address growing awareness

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:42.030 position:56%
of microscopic threats, in the early
1900s some canners experimented

00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:46.580
with sterilization process in
which food was heated several times

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:49.000
but at temperatures below boiling.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:55.780
And this is also a similar process
was actually promoted by the USDA

00:19:55.780 --> 00:20:00.770
in the teens: the intermittent
method

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:05.390
as a way to sort of kill off...

00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:09.810
The idea was that spores might
not germinate the first day

00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:11.500
but if you waited another
day then they would germinate

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:13.370
and then you could boil them
again and kill that, right?

00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:20.080
In 1932, well, actually in 1913,
three students at Stanford died

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:23.870
because they ate food
using this method.

00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:28.230
So it does have some risks.

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:35.760
Here's another sort of version
of canning as a site for display.

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:40.050
This is from the 1960s and
it's part of a concerted effort

00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:46.270 position:56%
to make canning appealing to younger
women and what's really interesting

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:48.790
in this is that it says, "Can't
you just see yourself praised,

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:51.140
admired, envied, appreciated?"

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:53.690
and it goes through each
of these different sort

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:56.860
of potential audiences
this young woman might have

00:20:56.860 --> 00:21:02.020
and shows how canning could
help her win some social status.

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:04.440
Another sort of ideograph
or narrative

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:06.520
that indexes this idea
of abundance, right?

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:08.970
So here we're back
at this other image.

00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:10.690
Because it was produced
by the Office

00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:15.550
of War Information during World
War II, it's also concerned

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:20.970
with abundance and it actually sort
of steps out of display conventions

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:24.120
that many home canners
have when they're not--

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:26.180
this is posed by a
photographer, right?

00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:31.120
So, often these will be
arranged according to sort

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:33.440
of color and type of food, right?

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:38.410
And these are sort of mismatched,
but they show the variety

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:41.910
of different kinds of
foods from potatoes

00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:48.640
to beets and peas, greens, right?

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.340
That's available, that
can be available

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:52.640
to families during wartime.

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:58.700
Sometimes I have been overwhelmed
by the abundance that I have seen

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:01.150
in the FSA and OWI files.

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:03.500
This family is actually the Doc

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:06.780
and Julia Miller Family
near White Plains, Georgia.

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:10.680
They have eight kids,
four teenagers.

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:14.950
There is a lot of variety in the
kinds of foods that are in display,

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:18.250
but I have to wonder how
they got all that food

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:20.200
out in the middle of
the yard, right?

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:23.790
I mean here's sort of
another view and all the times

00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:28.530
when Farm Security
Administration photographers were

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:33.380 position:56%
in some ways documenting the
results of funds that had been given

00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:38.650
to families as part of various
recovery programs, and I'm afraid

00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:42.130
that at times it was
inconvenient for them to display,

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:45.820
but it is an impressive show.

00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:48.190
Here we see a narrative
of self-sufficiency.

00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:51.260
The idea that you can pull
yourself up by your bootstraps,

00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:54.820
but you might need a
little help along the way.

00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:59.600
So, on this one side, it says "John
was not getting the right kind

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:02.660
of food, no garden, no cow,
no canned stuff for winter.

00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:04.200
Thousands of farm families are sick

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:06.280
because they do not
grow their own food."

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:08.530
The other side John two years later

00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:11.380
after his family started
the Live at Home farming.

00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:13.440
"Plenty to eat, the
right things to eat.

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:16.660
The families have learned to grow
their own good health" and script

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:20.460
"through Farm Security's
Program of Live at Home Farming."

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:23.730
Okay and these exact same images
were used for another panel

00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:27.310
that was called "They need
our help to help themselves".

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:30.780
Okay, so sort of posing
a choice that's available

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:34.320
to the individual and
also to the society.

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:38.440
Another thing that you'll
see is economic security.

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:40.540
Actually if you think about
it, canning is a practice

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:43.320
that enacts a nation's
dominant economic system, right?

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:45.730
It is a literal accumulation
of capital stored

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:49.220
up to enable future
productive capacity.

00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:53.490
Another theme is National Security
both in terms of food produced

00:23:53.490 --> 00:23:56.230
at home and abroad

00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:59.690
so that [inaudible] food will
win the war and write the peace.

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:02.850
But also here you see
it as a metaphor

00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:07.420
for geo-political containment,
all right, of the Kaiser.

00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:12.810
And the National Security images
seemed to inspire lots of moments

00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:19.830
of levity, at least given
canning's tremendous pun potential.

00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:22.130
So, here we have women
from Summit, New Jersey,

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:25.540
dressed in food conservation
uniforms ready for a parade

00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:31.210
to promote Hoover's voluntary
Food Conservation Plan, right?

00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:34.580
There wasn't mandatory
rationing in World War I.

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:38.190
So there's a parade and they
made these signs that say Work

00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:40.970
or Waste, Can a Can for Uncle Sam.

00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:43.250
Canner Collapse.

00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:46.470
Preserve or Perish is another
one that's not up here, right?

00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:48.150
So they've got their placards,

00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:50.820
they've got their uniforms,
they're ready to go.

00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:55.270
I also found through various
youth groups including 4-H

00:24:55.270 --> 00:25:00.820 position:56%
and Red Cross groups and food
conservation groups who got together

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:02.720
and they would have these
songs that they sing.

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:06.140
So if anyone wants to sing
this, it's to the tune

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:09.330
of "O'Maryland" or "O Tannenbaum."

00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:12.340
I will give you this
jar of raspberry jam

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:15.260
that I made earlier this summer.

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:16.990
[Laughter] Any takers?

00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:18.290
Basically...

00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:19.590
[inaudible].

00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:21.050
So this last part is: [sings]

00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:25.950
"Our garden truck we here preserve
/ Our food supply we now conserve /

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:31.130
And so democracy we serve /
Right here in Thompson Center."

00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:33.250
[ Applause ]

00:25:33.250 --> 00:25:34.550
Thank you.

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:39.040
And I believe Thompson Center is
here close by in Maryland, right?

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:43.400
Okay, we also have other puns here.

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:46.040
We have Elise Borden
and her calf, Beulah,

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:48.130
and with help of Elmer
the bull in bringing

00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:49.430
in tomatoes from the garden.

00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:52.390
Notice that they're using older
called "lightning style jars"

00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:56.050
with the glass lid and wire bail
perhaps because of war shortages

00:25:56.050 --> 00:25:59.110
of metal but also for
nostalgic value.

00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:02.900
And so we see this idea of
preserving the American way

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:06.590
and encoded in that sort of
notion of the American way

00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:10.440
that you see here, is a
division of labor based in gender

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:15.640
and there's a strikingly similar
New Yorker cover by Helen Hokinson

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:20.670
that also illustrates
division of labor based

00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:25.220
in class and race as well.

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:28.500
So, canning along with
other domestic tasks

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:33.380 position:56%
and skills was also used as a tool
of assimilation and/or became a mark

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:36.100
of acculturation on
American Indian Reservations

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:38.390
and in boarding schools especially
at the turn of the Century.

00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:40.590
So this idea of a particular kind

00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:42.740
of domesticity is also
related to canning.

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:45.020
And this is a group
that's gathered to learn

00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:47.570
about pressure cookers in Oklahoma.

00:26:47.570 --> 00:26:50.390
The woman in the middle as
far as I can identify her

00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:54.650
in her 60s is Lydia Humanstriker
[phonetic] who was a school teacher

00:26:54.650 --> 00:26:56.260
and married to a local judge.

00:26:56.260 --> 00:27:00.560 position:56%
The four boys in front were 4-H boys
who had to gather wood for the fire,

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:02.820
but this canning is
also sort of a source

00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:05.400
of pride and connection, right?

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:08.860
About how preserving strategies
sync with indigenous fruit planting

00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:10.770
and harvesting traditions.

00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:15.410
So, this display of I can't
tell exactly but I imagine

00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:16.790
at least some of those are peaches.

00:27:16.790 --> 00:27:20.960 position:56%
It would make sense because of the
orchards that Diné people had tended

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:25.630
for hundreds of years and then
we also here's another image

00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:31.140
by Virginia Stroud that is
referring to gathering cactus fruit

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:34.860
and berries as has been practiced
in many parts of the United States.

00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:41.290
And then finally here is another
form of sort of connection, right?

00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:44.880
We have a celebrity
with common roots.

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:47.700
This post on Loretta Lynne's
official Facebook page was shared

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:50.030 position:56%
almost 3,000 times and liked by more

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:52.710
than 30,000 people in
less than 24 hours.

00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:55.740
And it elicited thousands of
really fascinating comments.

00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:59.020
So that's just a quick rundown of
some of the cultural narratives

00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:02.790
that canning plays a role in that
gives a sense of the discursive

00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:05.660
and ideological context that we're
talking about and the context

00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:07.400
in which canning has
or does play a part.

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:10.180
So I'm going to switch gears a
little bit now because my thinking

00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:13.040
about context has been
simulated in the last few months

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:15.630
by the book called "The
Mushroom at the End" of the World

00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:17.500
by Anna Lowenhaupt Tsing.

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:21.170 position:56%
The book's subject is the matsutake
mushroom, a much sought after fungus

00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:23.670
that flourishes in the
wake of dissuption.

00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:28.510
In Oregon, it loves living near
the large pole pines that emerge

00:28:28.510 --> 00:28:31.190
after the ponderosas are gone.

00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:35.590
In Japan, matsutake thrive in
forest soils scrapped clean

00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:37.350
by peasant foresting.

00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:41.050
This mushroom's life ways are
complex, always a-tuned to

00:28:41.050 --> 00:28:44.650
and responding to other factors
in its immediate environment.

00:28:44.650 --> 00:28:48.490
Matsutake's [inaudible] is out
of step with modern capitalism,

00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:52.490
which is predicated on the ability
to scale up, to expand smoothly

00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:56.090
in new spaces without having to
rethink its framing assumptions.

00:28:56.090 --> 00:29:02.330
Scalability is achieved, she
writes, by minimizing encounter.

00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:07.010 position:56%
Monoculture plantations, for
instance, become infinitely scalable

00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:11.460
by first wiping local context
clean by clear cutting forests,

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:13.280
concreting existing communities

00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:15.930
and then importing cologne
[phonetic] sugar cane sort

00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:20.270
of a plant life that's
oblivious to encounter

00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:23.560
and coerced labor that's been
shorn of social relations

00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:25.560 position:56%
that could make a difference, right?

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:27.910
This plantation style alienation

00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:30.530
where parts are infinitely
interchangeable and exchangeable

00:29:30.530 --> 00:29:33.800
in the market can also been
seen in fast food franchises,

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:37.570
which seem so similar and
the workers so dispensable.

00:29:37.570 --> 00:29:41.050
Blank slate ferments in the
food world are another example

00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:44.970
of an attempt to make production
predictable by mitigating context.

00:29:44.970 --> 00:29:48.510 position:56%
In this case, makers of cheese, beer
or wine produce a consistent product

00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:51.900
by first removing existing
organisms in the base liquid

00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:55.070
and then re-inoculating
it with a pure culture

00:29:55.070 --> 00:30:00.040
of the bacteria they
wish to do its work.

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:01.750
So I've been thinking about
scalability in relation to the ways

00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:03.410
that home canning is
often coupled narratively

00:30:03.410 --> 00:30:05.240
to fear and to compliance.

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:08.400
If you Google botulism, you
get pictures of Mason jars.

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:11.240
Botulism is a specter that
has haunted home bottling

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:13.150
since the early decades
of this century.

00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:16.770
Not long ago when I attended
a high-end canning workshop,

00:30:16.770 --> 00:30:19.690
traveling lecture Marisa
McClellan started her demonstration

00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:22.340
where she always starts
by asking "who's afraid

00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:24.430
of killing your whole family?"

00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:26.970
[Laughter] She then explains
why the food she makes--

00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:31.630
jams, jellies and chutneys is no
more dangerous than moldy bread.

00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:34.630
"You can't kill anyone with
pickles," she told the crowd,

00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:36.300
but people are still afraid.

00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:39.810 position:56%
And I should acknowledge here that
there are real health risks involved

00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:43.310 position:56%
in food processing and the deaths
from botulism earlier and especially

00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:44.730
in the bottling of
vegetables and meat.

00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:47.870
U- to-date canning guidelines
are important and I encourage you

00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:50.670
to consult the National Center
for Home Food Preservation

00:30:50.670 --> 00:30:54.020
at the University of Georgia
for more specific information

00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:56.210
about current recommendations.

00:30:56.210 --> 00:31:00.110
These nationwide guidelines are
intended to ensure safety for all,

00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:02.760
regardless of specific context.

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:05.940
In the wake of botulism scares
of the 1920s, for instance,

00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:07.240
government instructors were asked

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:10.270
to recommend only pressure
canning-- just to be safe.

00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:12.260
So for everything.

00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:15.170
Instruction books like
this Hazel Atlas Manual

00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:19.310
from 1924 started telling their
readers to boil the contents

00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:20.840
of every bottle of vegetables

00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:23.910
and meat before consuming
it, just to be safe.

00:31:23.910 --> 00:31:27.500
Context-free practices like these
that arguably define modern life

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:31.220
and notions of progress also do
violence to localized knowledge,

00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:33.740
which is learned through lifetimes
of observation and practice

00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:37.590
and developed within circumscribed
intertwined ecosystems.

00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:40.630
In the case of home canning, I'm
going to focus on two examples

00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:43.400
of metaphorical clear-cutting
in the name of progress.

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:45.430
First I'll explore how
the idea of invention

00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:49.320
and discovery raised the complex
networks that actually give rise

00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:52.690
to innovation and in this
case erroneously reduce women

00:31:52.690 --> 00:31:55.110
to passive consumers of technology.

00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:57.040
The histories of canning
that crop-up in everything

00:31:57.040 --> 00:32:01.610
from food magazines to microbiology
textbooks invariably celebrate a

00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:04.020
single father of canning,
Nicolas Appert.

00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:07.400
You can see he's a hero
in France, as well, right?

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:10.600
He has his own stamp
and this is a park

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:14.360 position:56%
with a statue that's devoted to him.

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:17.000
Further, Appert is depicted
as a scientist motivated

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.400
by military concerns and aligns
progress with the blank state

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:26.310
of a laboratory; a space positioned
in contrast to grandma's methods.

00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:30.020
Second I'll consider
clostridium botulinum.

00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:33.840
The bacteria whose spore
produces the botulism toxin--

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:37.270
an example of living complexity
not unlike the matusake.

00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:38.690
When that emerges from and, indeed,

00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:41.220
is created by the ruins
of the modern world.

00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:44.420
Preconceive the complexity of
this microbe life makes me weary

00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:47.440
of blaming traditional knowledge
when something breaks down.

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:49.610
The efficacy of some
local practices--

00:32:49.610 --> 00:32:53.140
canning corn and tomatoes, for
instance, or sealing cooked sausage

00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:56.340
and lard they are rendered
useless or even dangerous

00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:58.280
by external factors
that include changes

00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:01.590
in population mobility-so
people are moving to new places

00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:03.710
with different altitudes
and climates;

00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:06.500
by changes of environmental
conditions, food systems,

00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:10.270 position:56%
food technologies ; and even changes
in the chemistry of the food itself,

00:33:10.270 --> 00:33:13.890
but these practices and the people
who do them experience another blow

00:33:13.890 --> 00:33:17.350
and they are then blamed for these
failures by being characterized

00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:20.220
as backwards, sloppy, habit
driven or simply ignorant

00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:22.200
when existing systems break down.

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:25.710
And I'm not saying that local
practice is inherently harmless.

00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:29.950 position:56%
For instance, I would not try to can
Vienna Sausages in the dishwasher,

00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:33.500
which I have heard of
people trying to do.

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:39.160
[Laughter] So, let me just take
you through sort of this story

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:41.640
of home canning that
is often out there.

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:44.270
And I chose this one
because it's kind of fun.

00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:47.550
It's from the brochure that
was handed out in my hometown

00:33:47.550 --> 00:33:50.360
of Columbus, Ohio, in the 1950s.

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:53.850
And I found it at the National
Museum of American History.

00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:55.300
Here's the story, right?

00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:58.320
"Home canning was first started
by a great soldier and emperor."

00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:01.980
They were losing men and I'll give
12,000 francs to any Frenchman

00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:04.510
who finds a simple
way to preserve food.

00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:08.560
So, Appert, you know,
drops everything.

00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:11.550
He starts doing experiments.

00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:15.900
He has some setbacks like
any good inventor does.

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:19.530
And then after 15 long years:
"You see, if food is sealed

00:34:19.530 --> 00:34:20.990
from air it will keep
for a long time,

00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:23.510
but different foods need
different recooking times."

00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:25.860
"And made this time
chart for all foods?

00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:28.840
Amazing!" "Finally in 1810..."

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:30.140
he receives the prize.

00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:33.500
And "At the same time in England.

00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:36.320
'You're seeing food in metal
canisters, Mr. Burant?"

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:38.430
(And that should be Durant.)

00:34:38.430 --> 00:34:41.130
"Yes..., you might say I'm
canning food, might'en you?"

00:34:41.130 --> 00:34:43.940
Canning became widespread by 1850
but no one knew why it worked,

00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:48.230
but thankfully there was
Louis Pasteur and he figures

00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:51.300
out that the bacteria
is the cause, right?

00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:54.720
And heating kills them if
they're in a sealed container.

00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:58.520 position:56%
Then we jump to "The Mason
jar...invented 96 years ago," right,

00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:01.590
and some different
versions of canning jars

00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:03.530
and they claim today more
food is canned at home

00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:06.300
in the combined output
of all canning factories.

00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:08.800
I have not been able
to verify that claim.

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:13.250
In any case, this same
history has been repeated

00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:17.360
in almost every history
of canning that you find.

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:24.270
In the magazine Lucky Peach,
in a film that is distributed

00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:28.130
for science classes, for instance.

00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:34.230
And this USDA website that was
recently launched does an excellent

00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:38.060
job bringing together primary
resources and documents related

00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:40.940
to the history of home canning, and
I encourage you to check it out.

00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:45.990
It also depicts very effectively
what the dominant history

00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:48.800
of canning looks like
in these stories.

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:54.030
Okay, so you have this huge blank
before a pear comes on the scene.

00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:58.310
Then you have this then nothing

00:35:58.310 --> 00:36:04.200
until John Mason invents
the Mason jar in 1858

00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:05.790
and then the Ball Corporation
comes in.

00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:13.670 position:56%
So, this sort of, a pear gets
lionized and actually James Collins,

00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:16.840
who wrote sort of the history
that everybody goes back

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:19.220
to for the history of the
commercial canning industry,

00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:22.730
he writes that "Nobody had
ever preserved fresh vegetables

00:36:22.730 --> 00:36:24.030
or fruits before.

00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:26.350
For ages, the world had known
only drying, salting and smoking

00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:29.130
to keep meats, fish and a few
fruits from season to season,"

00:36:29.130 --> 00:36:34.130
and he's actually publishing this
in a canning trade periodical

00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:36.710
and asking for other commercial
canners to give him feedback

00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:40.920
so that this will reflect
well on the canning industry.

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:48.590 position:56%
So, this sort of story that he tells
is very similar to other histories

00:36:48.590 --> 00:36:50.500
of food preservation
generally, right?

00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:51.820
And it's a very gendered story.

00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:55.020
So this undated poster-- perhaps
intended to grace the walls

00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:56.570 position:56%
of a mid-Century home ec classroom--

00:36:56.570 --> 00:37:00.340
tells a heroic narrative in which
engineered cold replaces passive

00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:03.410
heat as a way to arrest
for food decay.

00:37:03.410 --> 00:37:04.980
"Food Preservation from Cave Man

00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:07.770
to Kitchen" chronicles
technological advances that begin

00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:10.170
with Egyptian slaves drying
fish in the sun and ends

00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:12.750
with an aproned housewife
unwrapping steaks pulled

00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:14.890
from the build-in chest
freeze in her modern kitchen.

00:37:14.890 --> 00:37:16.450
In between our decades

00:37:16.450 --> 00:37:19.360
of exploration experimentation
and conquest.

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:22.680
And you can see here this
is where, right here,

00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:25.400
is where the Napoleon
a pear story comes in.

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:30.240
In most of this pictorial
history, women are bystanders

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:32.890
to the various forms of physical
and intellectual labor involved

00:37:32.890 --> 00:37:34.250
in making food last except

00:37:34.250 --> 00:37:36.510
for the final three
frames of the chronology.

00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:38.520
Here they stand alone
with refrigerators

00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:41.640
and freezers apparently
enjoying freedom from extra work,

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:45.010
but historian Susan Strasser and
Ruth Schwartz Cohen have long

00:37:45.010 --> 00:37:47.270
since dispelled the notion
that new household gadgets,

00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:49.170
fuels and processes actually

00:37:49.170 --> 00:37:51.790
or automatically make
women's lives easier.

00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:55.050
New technologies have often
simply created different work

00:37:55.050 --> 00:37:57.540
so the full burden of work
on a single woman's shoulders

00:37:57.540 --> 00:38:00.580 position:56%
or removed compensatory satisfaction
such as soon as social interaction

00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:04.260
or opportunities to
display skill and beauty.

00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:06.550
The images in this poster
confirm these losses.

00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:09.720 position:56%
These liberated women, for instance,
are noticeably divorced from messy,

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:12.450
sensory stimuli and
human interaction.

00:38:12.450 --> 00:38:15.010
A more recent source
also asserts that men

00:38:15.010 --> 00:38:16.870
and their inventions
improve women's lives

00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:19.110
but does so a bit more suddenly.

00:38:19.110 --> 00:38:21.810
This 1975 canning guide
explains "Traditionally,

00:38:21.810 --> 00:38:24.770
man has provided food and
woman has preserved it,

00:38:24.770 --> 00:38:26.940
but traditions change
and roles switch.

00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:28.240
In fact, the canning process

00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:30.720
for preserving food was
discovered by a man..."

00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:33.370
The next paragraph
describes Appert's experiments

00:38:33.370 --> 00:38:37.650
at the behest of Napoleon.

00:38:37.650 --> 00:38:41.060 position:56%
Then it continues: "Appert's
discovery made life easier for women

00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:44.470
who had come to preserve summer
harvest for winter nourishment.

00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:48.100 position:56%
And so home canning soon became a
family tradition with one generation

00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:51.870
of women passing their special
canning secrets along to the next."

00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:54.810
Like the food preservation poster
the Bernardin Manual reduces the

00:38:54.810 --> 00:38:57.480
idea of liberation to
extra leisure time.

00:38:57.480 --> 00:38:59.590
Appert made life easier for women,

00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:02.440
but in addition unlike the
suffrage era Campbell's Soup ads

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:04.160
that Catherine Parkin has analyzed,

00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:07.000
this 1975 manual coops
feminist discourses.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.770
It raises the ideas of changing
gender roles, increased freedoms

00:39:10.770 --> 00:39:13.020
and distinctive kinds of
knowledge but it does so in order

00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:15.030
to reassert the authority of men.

00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:17.960
That is even in regard to
women's work men did it first

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:19.310
and they did it more rationally.

00:39:19.310 --> 00:39:22.300
So men discover and women
have secrets, right?

00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:25.840
Even this purported special
knowledge is undermined

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:27.170
by the next section of the manual

00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:30.230
which reveals just what
those canning secrets are.

00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:33.640
Continual improvements in canning
technologies often rendered the

00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:36.340
experiential knowledge
of women obsolete,

00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:37.890
and grandma's knowledge
was presented

00:39:37.890 --> 00:39:40.770 position:56%
as dangerous, even life threatening.

00:39:40.770 --> 00:39:42.540
So I just want to quickly show some

00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:44.670
of the predecessors
that were out there.

00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:49.970
There was an Italian Abbot who
in 1765 had done some experiments

00:39:49.970 --> 00:39:55.340 position:56%
with meat extracts in closed flasks,
but he didn't really apply that.

00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:57.360
So James Collins, who wrote
the History of Canning,

00:39:57.360 --> 00:39:59.310
thought that was sort of a lame.

00:39:59.310 --> 00:40:01.490
If you can't apply it in
the commercial world, right,

00:40:01.490 --> 00:40:04.810
it doesn't really count as a
discovery, but there's also

00:40:04.810 --> 00:40:11.360
if you look at the manuscript
sources you can see that these sort

00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:16.910
of food preservation processes
that don't involve sugar,

00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:22.060
that involve heating and
sealing are happening.

00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:26.130
This particular one uses an oven.

00:40:26.130 --> 00:40:29.360
This is from the same
cookbook of Mary Mott.

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:31.590
This is another recipe
for gooseberries.

00:40:31.590 --> 00:40:34.720
You can see that is quite close
to the one that was published

00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:36.930
in 1703 that we saw earlier.

00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:40.540
I'm going to compare these on a
graph because I don't have time

00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:44.160
to read all of these, but
you can see they appear,

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:48.050
and most of these sources are from
Great Britain, but there are some

00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:53.340
that are from the United States
especially in the 19th Century.

00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:56.470
This one the very first page of
this book, right, you get a recipe

00:40:56.470 --> 00:40:59.230
for preserving currants
and then there's also one,

00:40:59.230 --> 00:41:01.810 position:56%
there's another version right below.

00:41:01.810 --> 00:41:08.400
Here's one from 1829 and this
one has four different recipes

00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:09.700
for bottling fruit.

00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:23.730
Okay, and so let me just
show you this graph of all

00:41:23.730 --> 00:41:27.710
of these different recipes
based on place, ingredients.

00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:31.260
You'll notice that hardly any
of them use liquid, right?

00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:35.430
And hardly any of them use
sugar until you get into sort

00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:40.030
of later in the mid-19th Century.

00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:44.210
Almost all of them there are a
couple of that sort of bake things

00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:48.710
in the oven, but the others
are all scalded in water.

00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:55.600 position:56%
They're all except for these two
are sealed before and they're sealed

00:41:55.600 --> 00:42:00.380
after with some particular
kind of, with resin or pitch

00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:01.770
or other kinds of things.

00:42:01.770 --> 00:42:04.700
There's precautions to take
them from breakage, right?

00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:08.560
And also sometimes they're supposed
to be for a particular duration.

00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:13.050
Well, that sort of big takeaway
is that all of these, right,

00:42:13.050 --> 00:42:14.960 position:56%
that are going on people are sharing

00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:18.860
with each other they're attributing
them to other women, right?

00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:24.470
Before Thomas Additing in
England and Nicolas Appert

00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:28.320
in France actually get patents on
these sorts of processes, okay.

00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:32.490
So they are, this knowledge
is circulating and, in fact,

00:42:32.490 --> 00:42:38.340
in 1814 there's a review
that basically says, oh,

00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:42.440
you didn't discover this: In behalf
of our country we must observe

00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:44.600
that unless they have forsaken
the example and precepts

00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:46.560
of their ancestors, they
must, already be more

00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:50.670
or less acquainted already with
the methods of Mr. Appert," right?

00:42:50.670 --> 00:42:53.240
So there's this at least then
there's a sort of acknowledged

00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:56.550
that this is a common process
that people are building from,

00:42:56.550 --> 00:42:59.560
but it's been erased in
our histories since then.

00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:01.880
Let me just go over briefly
some of the technological shifts

00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:07.580
that were happening because they
explain why the climate is so sort

00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:10.540 position:56%
of confusing in terms of processing.

00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:13.910 position:56%
Over the course of the 19th and 20th
Centuries home canning technologies,

00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:16.770
containers, closures, processing
equipment and processing techniques

00:43:16.770 --> 00:43:19.720
and even raw foods themselves
underwent a series of small

00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:21.680
but ultimately dramatic changes.

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:24.400
Here's a small sampling of closure
types that people tried at the end

00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:27.220
of the 19th Century when
home bottling as opposed

00:43:27.220 --> 00:43:29.460
to long-standing salt, sugar,

00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:32.490
vinegar-based preservation
methods became more common.

00:43:32.490 --> 00:43:35.370
These closures of [inaudible] and
wax or liquid lead or air pressure

00:43:35.370 --> 00:43:37.920
or rubber rings or mechanical
pressure from wires or clamps

00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:42.020
or a combination of all of
these just for good measure.

00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:44.730
And then we have the
open kettle method.

00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:48.600
People are using visual measures
in order to sort of figure

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:52.600
out what's happening and if
they need to re-boil something

00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:57.320
or there's one example of one of
these recipes I showed you said,

00:43:57.320 --> 00:44:00.190
okay, well, it's good if
you can keep it on the shelf

00:44:00.190 --> 00:44:02.080
because then you can watch
to see if it starts bubbling

00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:03.830
and when it starts bubbling,
you should take it off

00:44:03.830 --> 00:44:05.130
and do something else, right?

00:44:05.130 --> 00:44:08.780
So people are really
using sensory information

00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:14.030
to evaluate what's happening
and the problem with botulism is

00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:21.010
that it is not detectable in the
ways that people have been trained

00:44:21.010 --> 00:44:23.660
to detect and manage
spoilage, right?

00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:29.390
So, it's odorless and
it's tasteless and so

00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:33.990
that presents all sorts
of difficulties.

00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:40.030
What I found interesting is that
rather than being presented as sort

00:44:40.030 --> 00:44:45.060
of ignorant or unaware
of what was going on,

00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:48.300
when you look at the transcripts
of people who had been canning

00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:55.500
for lifetimes, they'll often
express that they are very aware

00:44:55.500 --> 00:45:00.470
of the kinds of things that
are recommended, right,

00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:04.840
and they talk about the ways
that their own families have kind

00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:07.330
of mediated or managed
those kinds of things.

00:45:07.330 --> 00:45:10.280
So she's giving here
specific information

00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:13.540
about how long she's processing
it and things like that.

00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:21.330
I wanted to just close
today by talking about some

00:45:21.330 --> 00:45:26.830
of our own contexts that
are changing, right?

00:45:26.830 --> 00:45:32.490
So botulism is interesting and
that context always matters.

00:45:32.490 --> 00:45:35.920
It matters through
what your altitude is,

00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:40.130
it matters how much
fat is in your process.

00:45:40.130 --> 00:45:43.880
It matters what kinds of sort
of temperature or humidity

00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:46.240
that you're working with.

00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:51.860
And so and all of these things
can sort of combine or intertwine.

00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:55.690
Even now contexts are
changing in these.

00:45:55.690 --> 00:46:00.310
So there is a FreshTECH Homemade
Automatic home canning system

00:46:00.310 --> 00:46:03.590
that has been initiated, right?

00:46:03.590 --> 00:46:06.670
It capitalizes on the social
value of sharing homemade food

00:46:06.670 --> 00:46:08.000
and pitches itself as a solution

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.000
for busy household
perhaps for working moms.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.210
In any case, they say
it's as easy as 1, 2, 3.

00:46:14.210 --> 00:46:20.180
Literally you pick 1 out of 28
jam, jelly, pickle, tomato sauce

00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:24.350 position:56%
or salsa recipes, prepare 6 half
pint or 3 quart jars, load the jars,

00:46:24.350 --> 00:46:27.070
push the button that corresponds
to your recipe and walk away.

00:46:27.070 --> 00:46:30.080
As the online description declares,
this machine and it's 70-built

00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:35.680
in safety features take "the
guess work" out of canning.

00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:38.740
And there's a whole sort
of literature I could talk

00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:45.290 position:56%
to you about, the ways that
women's knowledge has been, sort of,

00:46:45.290 --> 00:46:50.540
it has literally been described
as "guess work," right?

00:46:50.540 --> 00:46:53.010
This kind of experimentation,

00:46:53.010 --> 00:46:56.780
sensory investment
in what's going on.

00:46:56.780 --> 00:47:00.600
Trial and error tends to
be dismissed as guess work.

00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:07.650
And with this latest, this latest
invention of Ball there are canners

00:47:07.650 --> 00:47:09.200
that are pushing back
against the latest

00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:12.530
against the latest tool's
remove of guess work, right?

00:47:12.530 --> 00:47:13.830
Comments on the website
make it clear

00:47:13.830 --> 00:47:16.950
that most viewers dislike the
confines of this automated system.

00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:19.840
Wanting the freedom to experiment
with recipes to can all types

00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:22.630
of foods and to further
develop their own skills.

00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:24.570
And some have pointed out that
the canner works on the logic

00:47:24.570 --> 00:47:26.280
of fear suggesting that
they will finally be able

00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:28.160
to can a safe product.

00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:30.780
By playing on the risk of danger
and the allure of dependency

00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:33.360
that have characterized much
discourse on domestic technology

00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:35.720
in the last century,
Ball can sell a product

00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:38.420
that is essentially an
electric water bath--

00:47:38.420 --> 00:47:40.570
but not everyone is buying.

00:47:40.570 --> 00:47:43.770
Contexts keep changing and
so will canning just...Not

00:47:43.770 --> 00:47:46.520 position:56%
that long ago Ball revealed that
because it's changed the composition

00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:50.110
of the sealing compound boiling
lids is no longer necessary and is,

00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:53.530
in fact, detrimental,
which caused a big outcry

00:47:53.530 --> 00:47:56.990
because it's the one thing that's
changed in the last 7 years

00:47:56.990 --> 00:47:58.290
in terms of canning, right?

00:47:58.290 --> 00:48:00.960
So people got concerned.

00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:09.810
And so what I hope that you'll be
thinking about today is a story

00:48:09.810 --> 00:48:12.630
about how modernity, with spatial
mobility and its rapid changes

00:48:12.630 --> 00:48:14.470
to work processes and
technological systems,

00:48:14.470 --> 00:48:18.060
emphasis on receive knowledge, can
undercut knowledge based in place,

00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:20.640
personal experience
and sensory perception.

00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:23.110
The women and the materials I have
encountered are not, by in large,

00:48:23.110 --> 00:48:24.820
sloppy, careless or unintelligent.

00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:27.670
Instead they are working with
a complicated set of variables

00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:32.330
that feel the ripples of seemingly
smaller unconnected actions.

00:48:32.330 --> 00:48:37.380
Like the matsutake ecosystem.

00:48:37.380 --> 00:48:40.370
It's also a story of how any
invention is really a network

00:48:40.370 --> 00:48:44.730
of skills and gestures, but by
consolidating things in the figure

00:48:44.730 --> 00:48:49.120
of a pear, a concrete person
with a particular method, right?

00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:52.230
We can identify a point
of before and after.

00:48:52.230 --> 00:48:58.040 position:56%
Time moves forward then as
[inaudible] says marked by progress.

00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:01.510
In reality, life is a messy
overlap of technologies, materials

00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:03.100
and environmental context.

00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:06.340 position:56%
Each of us work within these systems
but because canning in systems is

00:49:06.340 --> 00:49:09.380
so enmeshed in the physical
world, because in fact,

00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:10.680
death is on the line,

00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:13.110
these interconnections
become a bit more visible.

00:49:13.110 --> 00:49:15.520
Perhaps it can help us think
more clearly about the roles

00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:19.370 position:56%
or everyday material worlds play an
acquiring, articulating, validating,

00:49:19.370 --> 00:49:21.750
endorsing and affirming
expert status.

00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:23.550
Thank you.

00:49:23.550 --> 00:49:32.040
[ Applause ]

00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:36.840
I'll be happy to take any
questions that anyone has.

00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:39.670
&gt;&gt; Male audience member:
Could you maybe summarize some

00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:42.730
of the mechanisms for
the shift from,

00:49:42.730 --> 00:49:47.040
I think you call it grandma's
knowledge to this more industrial

00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:49.530
or scientific language of canning?

00:49:49.530 --> 00:49:55.830
I know you touched on them, but
what are some of the mechanisms

00:49:55.830 --> 00:49:58.780
or causal factors that
drove that shift.

00:49:58.780 --> 00:50:01.510
It wasn't just that
a pear showed up.

00:50:01.510 --> 00:50:02.960
&gt;&gt; Danille Christensen:
Right, right.

00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:11.820
Well, part of it I mean it leads
to, it links to the rise of...

00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:16.330
so when sort of the laboratory and
science is valorized as the site

00:50:16.330 --> 00:50:20.020
of authentic knowledge-- and
I could show you pictures

00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:23.530
of these men sitting
around on the jam boards

00:50:23.530 --> 00:50:26.890 position:56%
and they're like evaluating the jam.

00:50:26.890 --> 00:50:34.480
Then domestic science starts moving
from spaces that seemed less.

00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:36.340
So a laboratory is a
space in which you're able

00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:38.840
to isolate particular
variable, right?

00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:43.500 position:56%
It's the sort of blank slate in a
sense and things start to make sense

00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:45.160
because you're only looking
at one particular thing

00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:47.700
and you're bracketing
everything else out, right?

00:50:47.700 --> 00:50:54.000
And so even in terms of, sort of,
uniforms that people start wearing

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:58.500
in domestic science classes, the
ways that domestic labs are sort

00:50:58.500 --> 00:51:01.020
of set up as these sterile
environments, right?

00:51:01.020 --> 00:51:05.530
In some ways it's a way
to try to adopt the power

00:51:05.530 --> 00:51:07.680
of scientific discourse
for themselves.

00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:11.310
It happens through schools,
it happens through club work

00:51:11.310 --> 00:51:14.370
where kids are being taught,
you know, the scientific method.

00:51:14.370 --> 00:51:20.560
I think there's a picture I have:
So this is a jam board, right,

00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:23.160
of the USDA chemistry guys.

00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:26.590
These are women who are using
sort of doing community canning

00:51:26.590 --> 00:51:30.400
with a large steam cooker, right,

00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:33.850
or boiling water bath
alongside the creek.

00:51:33.850 --> 00:51:37.810
And here's another example
of sort of a canning class,

00:51:37.810 --> 00:51:41.860
a demonstration that's taking
place outside on the playground.

00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:43.880
Those are very different
from the laboratory

00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:48.320
but you also have these
more rationalized spaces,

00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:53.440
these community canning spaces
and here is a good example

00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:56.940
of a canning club girl who is
part of a tomato canning club

00:51:56.940 --> 00:52:05.400
in which the girls in the 19 teens
would do these experiments, right?

00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:09.930
So she is doing, she is blocking
out that one variable of what kind

00:52:09.930 --> 00:52:13.190
of fertilizer you're using
and they would write reports,

00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:17.590
they earned their own money,
they were proud of being involved

00:52:17.590 --> 00:52:19.560
in the scientific process.

00:52:19.560 --> 00:52:23.080
So this is another mechanism
in which that kind of happens.

00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:28.270
Then on the flip side you've
got popular magazines and things

00:52:28.270 --> 00:52:31.810
that are downplaying
grandma's knowledge

00:52:31.810 --> 00:52:36.380
as there's a really
great, let's see....

00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:43.450
There's lots of displays of
people with pressure cookers

00:52:43.450 --> 00:52:45.370
or pressure canners to show
that they know the right

00:52:45.370 --> 00:52:48.570
and safe way to do it, right?

00:52:48.570 --> 00:52:50.450
Here's some instructions.

00:52:50.450 --> 00:52:57.970
But then you've got like these
images of grandma in which anybody

00:52:57.970 --> 00:53:03.050
like these processes are so simple
that anybody can operate it.

00:53:03.050 --> 00:53:07.660
There's actually, this is an
interesting source that I found.

00:53:07.660 --> 00:53:11.530
I started out, I got to it
from Prints and Photographs,

00:53:11.530 --> 00:53:15.890 position:56%
but it basically says, you know,
"It's amazing how people can't read.

00:53:15.890 --> 00:53:18.710
A cup of granulated sugar means
a cup of anything sweet..."

00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:23.750
shows she's saying that long-time
practices of substitution

00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:26.150 position:56%
and flexibility, right, are no good.

00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:28.710
And "A good recipe
is important, too.

00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:31.040
Those wonderful old recipes
handed down from grandma work

00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:32.820
for your mother but
only 'cause she'd...

00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:34.870
experimented with them many times."

00:53:34.870 --> 00:53:37.410
There "were probably frequent
failures blamed on the bad weather

00:53:37.410 --> 00:53:38.710
or other insignificant factors.

00:53:38.710 --> 00:53:41.380
It's much better to
reply on modern guides.

00:53:41.380 --> 00:53:43.690
Most of them have been tested more
times than you'd care to count.

00:53:43.690 --> 00:53:46.940
" So the logic here is
really screwy because it says

00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:50.340
like your grandma's recipes worked
because they've been tried a lot

00:53:50.340 --> 00:53:52.760
of times, but you should
really try these other recipes

00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:55.330
that have been tried a lot of
times by different people, right?

00:53:55.330 --> 00:53:59.040
Like the scientists versus your
grandma and the scientists win so.

00:54:00.150 --> 00:54:01.530
Any other questions?

00:54:01.530 --> 00:54:02.830
Yeah?

00:54:02.830 --> 00:54:04.600
&gt;&gt;Male audience member: At some
time you showed us a timeline,

00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:06.680
I think from a website
at the University of

00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:07.980
[ Inaudible ]

00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:14.720
where you noted at the beginning
there's not much happening,

00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:16.020
but I was wondering
how does this relate

00:54:16.020 --> 00:54:17.320
to the history canning
on an industrial scale?

00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:18.620
&gt;&gt; Danille Christensen: I'm sorry.

00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:19.920
Can you repeat the last part?

00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:21.220
&gt;&gt;Male audience member: How
does that relate to the history

00:54:21.220 --> 00:54:22.520
of canning on an industrial scale?

00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:24.530
&gt;&gt; Danille Christensen:
An industrial scale.

00:54:24.530 --> 00:54:28.230
The commercial canners trace
themselves back to Appert

00:54:28.230 --> 00:54:33.550
and to Peter Durand [phonetic]
in England who basically--

00:54:33.550 --> 00:54:39.550
one scholar argues that Durand took
Appert's patent and just wrote it

00:54:39.550 --> 00:54:43.220
in English and also added other
stuff just for good measure

00:54:43.220 --> 00:54:46.520
and sent it in and then it was
actually bought by another company,

00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:53.440
who actually like who started
canning in tin using that patent.

00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:57.350
&gt;&gt; Male audience member: Did it
take off quickly after discovery?

00:54:57.350 --> 00:54:58.900
&gt;&gt; Danille Christensen:
Commercial canning, yes.

00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:00.200
Uh-huh. Yep.

00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:03.720
So in the United States by...

00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:10.430
by at least 1825 there were
commercial canneries operating

00:55:10.430 --> 00:55:11.870
in the United States.

00:55:11.870 --> 00:55:19.690
Often the early ones canned fish
or other kinds of goods like that.

00:55:19.690 --> 00:55:22.620
&gt;&gt;Stephen Winick: So
you showed some examples

00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:26.060
of canning recipes
from the 17th Century.

00:55:26.060 --> 00:55:31.020
I wonder how far back we can trace
the idea of heat sterilizing,

00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:34.390
heat canning, they didn't
know they were sterilizing it,

00:55:34.390 --> 00:55:38.520
but I know there are medieval
cookbooks, but I don't --

00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:40.100
&gt;&gt; Danille Christensen: -- I
would be interested to know.

00:55:40.100 --> 00:55:41.400
I haven't looked at any.

00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:46.470
These are the earliest manuscripts,
manuscript books that I found

00:55:46.470 --> 00:55:52.980
in Rare Books, but I
would love to know.

00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:54.960
I'm sure it goes back
much farther, right?

00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:56.260
Yeah.

00:55:56.260 --> 00:55:59.630
&gt;&gt;Betsy Peterson: So when
is your book coming out?

00:55:59.630 --> 00:56:00.930
&gt;&gt; Danille Christensen:
The manuscript is due

00:56:00.930 --> 00:56:02.300
in March of this next year.

00:56:02.300 --> 00:56:06.520
So probably it'll be a year
and a half or so-- I'm hoping.

00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:08.570
[Laughter]

00:56:08.570 --> 00:56:11.210
&gt;&gt; Female audience
member: Thank you so much.

00:56:11.210 --> 00:56:18.520
I really wish I could sing
because I really want that jar.

00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:19.820
[Laughter]

00:56:19.820 --> 00:56:21.330
&gt;&gt; Danille Christensen:
It would have been better

00:56:21.330 --> 00:56:23.410
than my singing I'm sure.

00:56:23.410 --> 00:56:26.790
&gt;&gt; Female audience
member: No, really I can't.

00:56:26.790 --> 00:56:38.040
It's really an extension of
the slide you have up here--

00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:45.690
this tension between
male expertise and so

00:56:45.690 --> 00:56:50.240
at the perception of
female incompetence.

00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:57.080
It reminds me of practices
around childbirth

00:56:57.080 --> 00:57:04.390
when midwives were saying women
should give birth on their fronts

00:57:04.390 --> 00:57:07.980
and men are saying, no, no, women
should give birth on their backs.

00:57:07.980 --> 00:57:09.280
[inaudible].

00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:14.300
So specifically what are
the specific criticisms?

00:57:14.300 --> 00:57:18.680
Like is it women don't
follow receipts, or...?

00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:20.540
What is the incompetence?

00:57:20.540 --> 00:57:24.610
&gt;&gt; Danille Christensen: I
think really that flexibility

00:57:24.610 --> 00:57:30.790
and variation is a big one,
especially when it comes to things

00:57:30.790 --> 00:57:35.700
like canning because one
thing that Appert did do

00:57:35.700 --> 00:57:40.270
that was innovative is that-- and
also a bit hubris in my own mind--

00:57:40.270 --> 00:57:47.760
is that he decided that,
I mean he figured out how

00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:53.760
to can every single thing that you
could ever thing of doing, right?

00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:56.890
He figured out how much time
you would need to and so

00:57:56.890 --> 00:58:00.050
for some vegetables and meats
it was like 4 or 5 hours

00:58:00.050 --> 00:58:03.140
of boiling before you could,
before you had pressure canners

00:58:03.140 --> 00:58:09.030
that you could raise the
temperature to 240 or 250 degrees.

00:58:09.030 --> 00:58:12.090
And so Appert, he decides
that he wants

00:58:12.090 --> 00:58:17.390
to can every single thing whereas
in most people's practice, right,

00:58:17.390 --> 00:58:22.080
they have this multiplicity of
techniques that meets their goals

00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:26.000
and their needs for like the
performance of the product, right?

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:28.060
So, frozen corn tastes better

00:58:28.060 --> 00:58:32.490
and lasts better than
canned corn, right?

00:58:32.490 --> 00:58:36.210
Or dried apples are better for
fried pies because they don't have

00:58:36.210 --> 00:58:39.030
as much moisture and they
don't get soggy, right?

00:58:39.030 --> 00:58:43.200
So people like women
in real life are sort

00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:48.690
of choosing all these things, but
Appert has rationalized the process

00:58:48.690 --> 00:58:52.280
so much that it's like this idea

00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:56.820
of the plantation alienation
in some ways, right?

00:58:56.820 --> 00:59:01.840 position:56%
He just likes we're going to apply
this to the, we're going to scale it

00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:04.400
up to every single thing regardless

00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:07.000
of how good it tastes
or whatever, right?

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:10.640
Could you remind me of
the initial question

00:59:10.640 --> 00:59:13.660
because I think I've
gotten off a little bit?

00:59:13.660 --> 00:59:15.780
&gt;&gt; Female audience member:
No, no, it's a great job.

00:59:15.780 --> 00:59:19.070
Just where is the perception
of the incompetence?

00:59:19.070 --> 00:59:20.370
&gt;&gt; Danille Christensen: Oh, right.

00:59:20.370 --> 00:59:27.570
So, multiplicity, flexibility
also there's interesting,

00:59:27.570 --> 00:59:32.660
so part of that flexibility
is flexibility in the kinds

00:59:32.660 --> 00:59:35.030
of technology that you're using.

00:59:35.030 --> 00:59:42.210 position:56%
And so there's in 1935 the same sort
of grumpy bacteriologist who is mad

00:59:42.210 --> 00:59:48.180
about other things that women
are doing says, you know,

00:59:48.180 --> 00:59:51.350
some people can in wash tubs,

00:59:51.350 --> 00:59:57.670
which is I can't imagine how
you get a sanitary product

00:59:57.670 --> 01:00:07.150
from a wash tub except that
it's all like boiling, right?

01:00:07.150 --> 01:00:19.180
I mean and so this idea of
whereas a lot of canning literature

01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:31.310
from earlier in the century is
encouraging like you can do this,

01:00:31.310 --> 01:00:36.950
everybody can do this,
this is accessible to you.

01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:44.860 position:56%
All you need is some sort of pan,
something to put in the bottom of it

01:00:44.860 --> 01:00:47.990
to keep your bottles
off the metal, right?

01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:51.510
And you're ready to go.

01:00:51.510 --> 01:00:58.920
So I think just the
open-endedness of it all, right?

01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:03.980
It doesn't fit within
that paradigm of control.

01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:05.740
&gt;&gt;Male audience member:
Explain to me the tension

01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:07.380
between like the rationalization
process

01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:09.030
and the folk practices of women.

01:01:09.030 --> 01:01:13.010
I wonder if you could kind
of help graph that out for me

01:01:13.010 --> 01:01:18.780
or explain the tension between
domestic and whether they kind

01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:22.360
of followed along the
same kind of graph.

01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:26.200
Because when I think of
canning I think of the opposite

01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:28.750
of consumption, right, you know?

01:01:28.750 --> 01:01:31.540
Instead of consuming
one is preserving,

01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:35.650
when one should be consuming.

01:01:35.650 --> 01:01:41.620
I think that's probably
why it's so popular now.

01:01:41.620 --> 01:01:43.300
&gt;&gt; Danille Christensen:
Because its production, yeah.

01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:46.770
&gt;&gt; Male audience member:
Resistance to consumption.

01:01:46.770 --> 01:01:52.520
I wonder if you can kind of help
me graph those things together

01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:53.820
or whether that --

01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:56.560
&gt;&gt; Danille Christensen: -- so you
mean how has commercial canning

01:01:56.560 --> 01:02:00.270
and home canning in
dialogue with each other?

01:02:00.270 --> 01:02:02.300
&gt;&gt; Male audience member:
Yeah or whether there is,

01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:05.950
whether that same kind of
tension between, you know,

01:02:05.950 --> 01:02:09.460
rationalized processes versus
domestic processes also at work

01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:15.710
in sort of commercial processes
versus domestic processes?

01:02:15.710 --> 01:02:17.170
You know what I'm saying?

01:02:17.170 --> 01:02:18.470
Or maybe not?

01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:19.790
&gt;&gt; Danille Christensen:
You mean where sort

01:02:19.790 --> 01:02:23.770
of domestic processes is
less rationalized relatively

01:02:23.770 --> 01:02:25.070
speaking than?

01:02:25.070 --> 01:02:26.370
&gt;&gt;Male audience memebr Yes.

01:02:26.370 --> 01:02:27.670
&gt;&gt; Danille Christensen: Yeah,

01:02:27.670 --> 01:02:28.970
I mean it definitely
happened on smaller scales.

01:02:28.970 --> 01:02:30.270
Although there are some people who
are doing lots of quantity canning.

01:02:30.270 --> 01:02:31.570
The-- one of the reasons that
people thought Appert was

01:02:31.570 --> 01:02:32.870
so revolutionary actually is that
he devised a plan for scaling

01:02:32.870 --> 01:02:34.170
up like this is, this
is how I did it

01:02:34.170 --> 01:02:35.470
and this is how we can build
a bigger apparatus and do it

01:02:35.470 --> 01:02:36.770
so that we can sell it, right?

01:02:36.770 --> 01:02:38.070
So that's one of the
things that happened.

01:02:38.070 --> 01:02:39.370
I would say that domestic sciences
and also sort of the threat

01:02:39.370 --> 01:02:40.670
of botulism has sort of taken
a lot of the flexibility

01:02:40.670 --> 01:02:41.970
out of home canning
procedures now, right?

01:02:41.970 --> 01:02:43.270
Because when people
move to different areas

01:02:43.270 --> 01:02:44.570
of the country they're using
maybe food stuff that are not as,

01:02:44.570 --> 01:02:45.870 position:56%
you know, tomatoes aren't as acidic
as they used to be or there are lots

01:02:45.870 --> 01:02:47.170
of sort of variables that happen
now that require this sort

01:02:47.170 --> 01:02:48.470
of blanket everybody do the same
thing so that everybody is covered

01:02:48.470 --> 01:02:49.770
and we're not going to have
any leeway because there's

01:02:49.770 --> 01:02:51.070
so many variables now
that have changed

01:02:51.070 --> 01:02:52.370
that people can't necessarily rely
on traditional methods anymore.

01:02:52.370 --> 01:02:53.670
So I don't know if I
answered your question but.

01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:54.970
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:02:54.970 --> 01:02:56.270
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: One more question.

01:02:56.270 --> 01:02:57.570
&gt;&gt; Danille Christensen: Yeah.

01:02:57.570 --> 01:02:58.870
Go ahead.

01:02:58.870 --> 01:03:00.170
&gt;&gt; Female audience
member: Thank you so much.

01:03:00.170 --> 01:03:01.470
I didn't get to the beginning
of your presentation.

01:03:01.470 --> 01:03:02.770
I'm wondering if you have covered
the practices in Eastern Europe?

01:03:02.770 --> 01:03:04.070 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Danille Christensen: I'm focusing
on the United States in context,

01:03:04.070 --> 01:03:05.370
yeah, but I would be
curious to know I know

01:03:05.370 --> 01:03:06.670 position:56%
that Eastern Europe has
traditionally had a lot of pickling.

01:03:06.670 --> 01:03:07.970
And I would be interested to know
if there is a strong non-sugar,

01:03:07.970 --> 01:03:09.270
non-salt, non-vinegar
based practice as well.

01:03:09.270 --> 01:03:10.570
&gt;&gt;Female audience member: Yeah,
and I have a couple of comments ...

01:03:10.570 --> 01:03:11.870
[ Inaudible ]

01:03:11.870 --> 01:03:18.380
You were talking about
botulism and doing things in ...

01:03:18.380 --> 01:03:20.330
[ Inaudible ]

01:03:20.330 --> 01:03:22.960
to justify ...

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:25.640
[ Inaudible ]

01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:33.180
started doing it less because
of the fear of botulism.

01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:35.500
Have you

01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:38.370
[ Inaudible ]

01:03:38.370 --> 01:03:49.090
to the economic situation,
to lack of social......

01:03:49.090 --> 01:03:50.390
[ Inaudible ]

01:03:50.390 --> 01:03:51.690
&gt;&gt;Danille Christensen:
Yeah, I think, you know,

01:03:51.690 --> 01:03:54.400
a lot of people don't know that
the things that people process

01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:57.870
at home most of the time nowadays--
jams, jellies, pickles, those, --

01:03:57.870 --> 01:03:59.730
botulism is not really an issue

01:03:59.730 --> 01:04:02.990
because you've got those added
preservatives already built in,

01:04:02.990 --> 01:04:04.290
right?

01:04:04.290 --> 01:04:08.600
By definitely in that sort
of 80s and 90s the canning,

01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:13.840
the canning industry people
were really like aware of all

01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:16.770 position:56%
of these sort of social factors that
were also affecting those practice

01:04:16.770 --> 01:04:20.770 position:56%
and yet I think it's easy for people
to say," oh, I'm afraid of doing

01:04:20.770 --> 01:04:22.990
that because I don't
want to do it wrong."

01:04:22.990 --> 01:04:25.640
It's an easy out for not having
to sort of being involved

01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:29.920 position:56%
in the practice especially if other
people think you should be doing it,

01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:31.220
right?

01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:32.520
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: I want
to thank you so much.

01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:36.600
I want to thank Danille
Christensen for coming and you all

01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:39.390
for coming and for a great talk.

01:04:39.390 --> 01:04:41.190
Thank you.
