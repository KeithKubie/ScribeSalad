00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
for some it's about brand loyalty for
some it's about aspirations that are

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.649
marketed and advertised different ways
but but let me try to answer it as a

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.650
kind of technical question question of a little bit
more as a technical question

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:19.320
so some of this comes down to
the ways in which we think about

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.760
computer systems

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:28.710
so generally if you think about it
this way you have what we would call the

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:36.149
hardware then on top of this we have a
special set of programs called the

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:43.200
operating system and on top of the
operating system you will have what's

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.710
called applications, yeah? now all of those also have what, broadly

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.600
speaking, is a windowing system

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.559
so this is the ways in which they present
themselves to you

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:03.899
this would be you, you would interact
with a window, say, and that window

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.970
would interact with what processing
applications say that what process an

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.409
application would ask that the
underlying operating system to do

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.880
certain things like opening a file and that
opening a file would make certain things

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.950
happen on the hardware. so there's quite a
long history of different operating

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.299
systems, from the very first inception
you would have different operating

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.250
systems which would run in different
manufacturers equipment so IBM would

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.200
have one Honeyware would have another ICL
would have another and all of those

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.079
different systems would each have their own
operating systems

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.630
so the BBC micro had one, the Commodore
64 had another and all of those would

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.430
come and go so they'd be closely kind of
tied to the hardware. historically

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.020
what's happened is that they'd also, each of
those manufacturers, would offer a

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.040
different way of presenting the computer
so they have different windowing

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.729
systems

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.750
so originally did they would simply be
commanding, you type out a command line

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:04.740
and something would happen

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.080
but macs and pcs have been two of the
main competitors, at one point

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.190
through the early eighties the big
diference that people would speak about

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.890
would be the windowing system difference.
one was graphical one had a desktop made

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.380
for it, the other didn't. with the advent of
that sort of facility on Windows

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.959
machines that difference is less clear

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:35.040
so a windows 8 machine and a Macintosh
interface uses icons many recognise in

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.030
in similar ways

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.010
but you still will have a religious
separation between people about both

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.069
each to each say but only in slightly
different ways

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:50.940
so today I think the real difference
between them is that Apple still own and

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.250
build the hardware that they put their
operating system on so they exist both

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.769
is a software company and a hardware
company and it's only recently that

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.709
Microsoft have even attempted to do that
again

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.989
so the microsoft surface is the first
time Microsoft have thought to do this

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.549
why is that important? Well, it's
important because what the operating

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:19.920
system has to do is translate the
applications needs into things for

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.840
the computer, the hardware, to do and if
you've built that hardware

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.450
you know how the hardware works, you can
optimize in particular ways. if you don't

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:36.180
then you can't necessarily do that
quite as smoothly and quite as

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.069
efficiently. So detecting things
happening in the hardware is more

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:46.950
difficult if you haven't built it because
you're relying on other people building

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.690
things. so that's why

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:54.690
the operating systems in Macintoshes can actually make

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.030
presumptions about the hardware and
it's use and therefore build an optimized

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.230
and can test it

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.150
so they've actually tested their systems
with the actual hardware that they

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.310
run on Microsoft have a different
orientation their operating systems

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.860
are installed in many manufacturers' hardware

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.120
and so they can't really test it on every single

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:23.690
possible machine, so that means that not
as optimal at that point or smooth at

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.730
that point and they're relying on what's
called device drivers being specifically

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:33.680
installed for each device so that would
translate the operating system commands

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:41.300
specifics of that hardware. that's why
often you see when you're using a pc

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.280
machine or Microsoft machine you will
see our own need to reinstall and update

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.160
and change different drivers, mostly

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.790
those are invisible in the Macintosh
because they're pretty much owned by

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:58.130
apple and installed by Apple and updated
by Apple. the plus side of this is that

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.560
it feels nice and and more efficient

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.930
the downside of this is you've only got
one machine that it runs on and therefore

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:13.310
you've got a concealed unit which means
that Macintosh machines are often accused

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.600
of being more expensive
because on windows, on windows type

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:18.380
devices,

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.640
you can run it on a range of hardware
from high to low end and you can

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.030
optimize the place of the hardware down
by running on that

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:30.770
where as you don't have that range of
hardware in quite the same way. i've used

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.450
Macintosh's and Microsoft as the kind of
classic divisions that people use, but if

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:39.590
you actually go through the the range of
others this separation down into

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.900
different systems also applies

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.280
so in terms of Linux, Linux roots are
from original open source unix

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:51.110
people of taking the converging unix
platform and ported and made it work

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:57.440
on a pc environment and set
pc environments and so that operating

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:02.000
system is capable of running across a
wide range of hardware. and also there is

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.680
a number of windowing systems that it
itself supports now the advantage with

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.580
Linux environments is that Linux environments
are open

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.190
so no corporation or company owns them
quite the same way

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:18.630
they're open source and modifiable by
people, and people can moderate

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:26.250
them and use them so its championed as one
of the classic, it's championed

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:30.210
one of the biggest forces for
keeping the internet and computer

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.210
systems open and accessible to all

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:42.009
floating-point looks at one tenth plus two tenth,
what you just typed in, 0.1 plus 0.2

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:48.490
in decimal, and it says that one tenth plus two tenth
does not quite

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:53.889
equal three tenths because, to its mind, it doesn't.
