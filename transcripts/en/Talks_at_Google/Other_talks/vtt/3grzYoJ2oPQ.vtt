CHRIS DIBONA: Hi, everyone.

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.470
I'm Chris DiBona.

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:05.440
It's good to be here.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.770
I'm here to introduce Chris
Anderson to you and the

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.080
offices that have VC'd in.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.420
Since we do have a number of
offices VC in and because it's

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.370
the right thing to do, if you
have any questions, we do have

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.280
a microphone set up in the
middle of the room

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.210
here near the front.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.850
So feel free to line up
and ask questions.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:24.820
Chris will talk about the

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.360
parameters of question answering.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.410
It's very important that
we get this right.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.950
But I think he's pretty
open to whatever

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:31.290
you want to do there.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.790
We do have some books available
at, what looks like,

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.250
a subsidized price over here.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.020
And I think, Chris, you're
going to do signings

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.140
afterwards, if you're
up for that?

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:39.640
CHRIS ANDERSON: Absolutely.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:39.940
CHRIS DIBONA: Yeah?

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.180
So his fingers have healed
since his long book tour.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.240
I don't really need to introduce
Chris too much.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.940
He worked at a couple of small
magazines, "The Economist,"

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.750
"Wired," "Nature?"

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:53.070
CHRIS ANDERSON: "Nature
[? of ?]

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:53.595
Science."

00:00:53.595 --> 00:00:54.090
CHRIS DIBONA: "Nature [? of ?]

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.800
Science," those little things,
and is now currently wanted

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.210
for supplying national security
secrets in the form

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.410
of drones to the world.

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.640
No?

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.990
No?

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.870
Is that not true?

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:08.925
CHRIS ANDERSON: Not
wanted yet.

00:01:08.925 --> 00:01:10.580
CHRIS ANDERSON: Not
wanted yet.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.670
So that's good.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.980
And maybe he'll talk about that
in his talk that he's

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.860
about to present today about his
new book, "Makers, The New

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.240
Industrial Revolution."
So Chris?

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.587
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:23.587 --> 00:01:25.450
CHRIS ANDERSON: Thank
you, Chris.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.920
This is my favorite
place to speak.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.780
This is the one group where I
feel like I can just geek out.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.440
And it'll be a good thing,
rather than the usual dazed

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.880
looks I get on this stuff.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.680
So what I'm going to be talking
about today is, I

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.040
think, kind of a big deal.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.720
This is basically the
industrialization

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.690
of the Maker Movement.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.340
But I feel that it's the third
wave of the Digital

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.970
Revolution, PC, web, and
then the real world.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.650
Bringing the web to the real
world seems like a pretty big

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:58.410
deal to me.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:04.300
And what I'm going to do is walk
you through the evolution

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.180
of what is both the Maker
Movement and its ultimate

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.080
economic impact, what could be
an Industrial Revolution, and

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.530
then give you an example of one
bit of it in the form of

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.510
my incredibly geeky hobby turned
company turned God

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.130
knows what in the forms
of drones and

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.650
robotics and all that.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:33.260
We're going to go from 3D
printers to open supply chains

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.200
and all that.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.790
But let me just start with
one page of thesis.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.930
And then this will be the
last text you see.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.330
Basically, this is simply it.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.210
20 years of finding a new way
to work together, of a new

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.780
innovation model.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.220
Well, that's what the
web really is, it's

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.140
an innovation model.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.630
Yeah, it's technology.

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:51.520
Yeah, it's infrastructure.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.320
But fundamentally, what it
unlocked is a exciting way to

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.060
tap spare cycles, latent
energies, talents that weren't

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.800
otherwise tapped in the existing
innovation models and

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.510
change the world.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:05.930
So we get it.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.620
But that's on the world
of screens and bits.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.500
And we live in the world of
atoms and real stuff.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.590
And if we can just apply that
innovation model to everything

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.640
else, just think what
could happen.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:19.950
We're starting to do that.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.070
But before we do, I
just wanted to--

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.690
I used the word Industrial
Revolution on the

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:25.380
cover of the book.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.200
And that's a big word.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.770
Let's remember what Industrial
Revolution is.

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:32.020
The first Industrial
Revolution--

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:36.330
we'll have a little quiz here.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.330
I'm going to give you
three centuries.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:40.440
And you can tell me when you
think the Industrial

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.690
Revolution--

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.820
How many people think the
Industrial Revolution happened

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.290
in the 1700's?

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.140
How many people thought it
happened in the 1800's?

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.890
And how many people think it
happened in the 1900's?

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:52.850
OK.

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.410
The answer is 1700's, 1776.

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.060
Same year as the American
Revolution was the deployment

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.230
of the spinning jenny, which was
basically a spinning wheel

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.980
with multiple wheels.

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.550
Now we'd had spinning wheels
since fairytale times, castles

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.240
and princesses and all
this kind of stuff.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.170
But what a spinning jenny did
is it used a foot treadmill

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.350
and then just spun multiple
wheels at the same time and

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.750
amplified human power and
basically continued the

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.220
movement of moving us from
muscle power to machine power.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.350
And that was first driven by
feet, and then by water, and

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.280
then by steam, and ultimately
created the factory.

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.450
And so this is what
you imagined.

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:38.530
This is a mid-1800's factory,
textile mill in England.

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.270
Now this did amazing things.

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.270
Not only did it turn us from
beasts of burden to more using

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.310
our heads, but it also
concentrated

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.050
us around the machines.

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.970
Now this is a good thing
and a bad thing.

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.840
It's a good thing in that it
created the city, it created

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:00.510
urbanism and everything we now
celebrate with concentrated

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.280
populations.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.170
It also vastly increased
quality of life.

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:10.520
This is what happened to life
expectancy as the factory was

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.030
created, as we moved
to cities.

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:13.530
It doubled life expectancy.

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.100
Now we think of rural England
as being pastoral and

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.700
wonderful and healthy and
all this kind of stuff.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.620
But in fact, they had no access
to clean water, no

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.700
sanitation systems, the walls
were damp, and no access to

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:25.910
good health care, et cetera.

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.970
What cities offered, despite
the old dark, satanic mills

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.080
and all this kind of stuff, what
they actually offered was

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.990
sewage systems, clean water
supplies, health care,

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:39.870
education, all these
kind of things.

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:44.080
And they very quickly doubled
the life expectancy.

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.940
And this is what they did
to the population.

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.050
That's what concentrating us
around the tools of production

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:55.320
did to the population
of England and then

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.660
the rest of the world.

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.630
Now that's all good.

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.080
What was bad--

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.910
or not bad, but one of the
downsides of this is that,

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:06.330
basically, it focused production
around the things

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.260
that made sense for factories,
around massive

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:09.050
economies of scale.

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.300
So the things that got made
were the things that were

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.110
mass-produced.

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.500
Now that's great, if you
want cheaper spoons.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.790
But it really limits
choice and variety.

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:22.940
And so we ended up with that
sort of Marxian construct of

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.120
power going to those who
control the means of

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.470
production and the man deciding
what gets made.

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:32.580
You just couldn't beat those
economies of scale.

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.300
Now that is, again,
no bad thing.

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.900
It improved quality of life
and gave access to

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:42.250
high-quality goods to everybody
or to many people.

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:45.820
But we did destroy the
cottage industry.

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:49.490
We did destroy craftsmanship,
artisanal construction.

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:53.560
And ultimately we ended up, as
that trend towards cheaper

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:57.200
labor continued, eliminating
many manufacturing jobs

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.170
outside of Asia.

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:01.630
That was the first Industrial
Revolution.

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:06.320
That took us from about 1776
to mid-20th century.

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.100
Then came, what we could call,
the second Industrial

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.470
Revolution, which is the
Digital Revolution.

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:13.800
Now I'm not showing
the mainframe.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.760
And I'm not even showing
a personal computer.

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:20.670
Instead, I'm using a different
construct here, which is

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:22.726
called publishing,
if you will.

00:07:22.726 --> 00:07:25.910
What I'm showing here is the
first laser printer, the Apple

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:27.670
LaserWriter from 1985.

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:32.830
It came out one year after the
Mac and cost about $2,500.

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:35.090
Now that created desktop
publishing.

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:36.890
And today, we think nothing
of desktop publishing.

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:40.400
But when that came out, these
more mind blowing words,

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.685
desktop publishing.

00:07:41.685 --> 00:07:46.030
Now publishing was
a factory job.

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:49.460
To publish, you had to buy ink
by the barrel, buy paper by

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:51.450
the railway car.

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:54.170
You needed to have a printing
plant to publish.

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:56.450
And now you could do
the same quality

00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:58.760
production on your desktop.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:07:59.430
That's good.

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:01.200
That's impressive.

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.700
Hundreds of years of
professional skills and

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:07.280
publishing were turned into
a bit of software

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:08.650
and a button press.

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:12.410
But you couldn't really be
a publisher, because you

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:14.280
couldn't distribute.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:17.160
You could make church
newsletters and missing cat

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.870
posters, but you couldn't
make millions and

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:19.820
get them out there.

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:21.660
And then, along came the web.

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:24.890
And "publish" turned into
a button that you

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:25.840
click on the screen.

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.470
And every time you press the
Publish button, whether it's

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:31.090
on your blog or whatever, you
don't think about it, but

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:36.270
you've basically turned what
used to be a industry run by

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:38.539
factories and professionals,
and you've turned it into a

00:08:38.539 --> 00:08:39.730
single click.

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:42.870
But that act of democratizing
the tools of prototyping and

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:46.840
then the tools of distribution
basically took the publishing

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.370
industry and opened it
up to everybody.

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:50.160
And we know what happened.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.110
That was the web and
the long tail.

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:54.480
And it changed the world.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.640
OK, but you take those
two analogies

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.930
and now fast forward.

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:04.080
Rather than the laser printer,
we have the 3D printer.

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:07.240
This is the new Replicator
2 from MakerBot.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:11.230
And it does the same thing as
a laser printer, which is to

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:12.910
say it takes bits on
the screen and

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:13.860
turns them into atoms.

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:17.040
Now a 2D printer takes bits on
the screen in turns them to

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.530
ink or toner or things
like that.

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:22.440
A 3D printer takes images,
polygons, designs on the

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:26.840
screen, and turns it into a
physical object that's built

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:30.400
up in layers of plastic
or other materials.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.150
But once again, it
takes all the

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:33.890
complexity out of the process.

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:35.060
You don't need to know anything

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:36.710
about plastic or machining.

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:38.860
You just press a button and,
poof, out it comes.

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:40.690
OK, that's great for
making one or

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:41.980
two or three of something.

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:42.990
It's great for prototyping.

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:45.600
They call rapid prototyping.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:46.910
But that doesn't make
you a manufacturer.

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:48.670
That doesn't make
you a factory.

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:51.660
The next step is actually less
understood, but probably more

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:56.090
exciting, and that is basically
cloud manufacturing.

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:58.590
The world's supply chains are
now impedance matched to the

00:09:58.590 --> 00:09:59.660
individual.

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:01.320
Now what does that mean?

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.450
What I'm showing here is a
picture of Alibaba, which is

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:05.060
one site among many
which gives you

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:07.830
access to Chinese factories.

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:10.780
Over the past decade or a little
less than a decade,

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:12.000
three things have happened.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.820
And I'm using Chinese factories
as one example,

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:15.240
though it extends beyond them.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.150
Three things have happened
to Chinese factories.

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:18.415
First of all, the
web generation

00:10:18.415 --> 00:10:19.400
has come into power.

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:20.650
They get it.

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:25.070
Opening a web interface is
the right way to work.

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:27.860
Number two, their own
manufacturing systems are

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:30.000
increasingly robotic and
automated, which means they

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:30.970
are very flexible.

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:32.090
They can make small batches.

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:33.890
And they can change the
design very quickly.

00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:36.890
And number three, they realized
that serving small

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:40.670
batches, serving a niche
interest actually is a higher

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:41.380
margin business.

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:44.570
That's the way they get out of
the commodity trap is by

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:47.500
offering small batch, custom
bespoke services.

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:51.470
Now I know this because about
five years ago I was messing

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:54.870
around my kids, and we came up
with this really cool robot

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:58.320
blimp using Arduino and
some LEGO parts.

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.440
And really, blimps are lovely.

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:01.760
If you have kids, blimps
are just the best

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.470
thing to have around.

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:04.280
They're like fish.

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:05.580
And they sleep on the ceiling.

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:07.270
It's great.

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:09.370
And we posted the
designs online.

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:11.470
And people were like,
that's cool.

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:13.200
I just don't think I want to
go to DigiKey and get these

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.470
parts and solder them
together myself.

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:16.010
Could you please make a kit?

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:18.500
And we're like, OK.

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:21.340
And then we learned something
about kit making.

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:23.180
When you're buying the
components to a kit, don't buy

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:26.860
them retail, because then the
kit gets really expensive.

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:28.060
So I had to buy them
wholesale.

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:30.070
And there were motors, two
motors in particular.

00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:33.640
And so it's like I want out to
Alibaba to find motors that I

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:34.980
could buy wholesale.

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:36.730
And it turns out that, although
they would sell me

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:38.585
motors wholesale, they actually
said, you know, it's

00:11:38.585 --> 00:11:40.260
just as easy for us to custom
make them for you.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:41.380
What specs would you like?

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:42.050
Shaft length?

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:42.690
Windings?

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:43.660
Motors?

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:44.260
Voltages?

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.230
And I was like, I don't
really know.

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:49.080
But they walked me through it
with a form I could fill out.

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.790
And then we did it.

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:53.820
And then I gave them my
credit card number.

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:58.530
And 10 days later, I got a box
of 1,000 motors with that

00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:00.210
little greasy sheen, because
they'd just come out of the

00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:02.845
factory and this foam
layer between them

00:12:02.845 --> 00:12:03.770
with all these little--

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:05.330
it was all perfectly made
in a layer of plastic.

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:06.500
And I was like, oh my god!

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:08.330
I just got a factory
in China--

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:10.770
I got robots in China
to work for me.

00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:13.820
And I didn't need anything
more than a credit card.

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:15.290
Now this may not seem like
a big deal to you.

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:17.690
But I used to live in China, and
I can tell you it didn't

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:19.520
used to be like that.

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:22.190
If you wanted a factory in China
to work for you, you had

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:23.610
to fly to Hong Kong.

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:26.930
You had to use a facilitator
or a finder to make an

00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:29.180
introduction to a factory.

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:32.560
Much trust or lack thereof
went on there.

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:33.580
You then went across
the border.

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:34.230
You got that introduction.

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:35.760
You had a very awkward
meeting.

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.380
This involved then going
to dinner together.

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:41.380
You had eat fish eyeballs, kind
of a hazing ritual thing.

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:44.770
And then more drinking,
karaoke.

00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:45.470
And this went on.

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:46.790
And then you had to get
a letter of credit.

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:47.960
And then a bank transfer.

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:51.170
And then like six months later,
after much negotiation,

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:52.950
you might get your samples.

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:55.010
And you had to be a company,
by the way.

00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:57.950
And I had just done it in 20
minutes with a credit card.

00:12:57.950 --> 00:12:59.370
And I'm just a guy.

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:03.230
And at that moment, I realized
that the world's supply chains

00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:04.940
had opened up to
the individual.

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:07.470
And it's only gotten
better since then.

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:10.620
So now we have this way.

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:12.770
What the Maker Movement
represents, what this part of

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:15.920
the Maker Movement represents is
the web generation getting

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.100
to physical stuff.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:20.100
And what that means is the
designs start on-screen.

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:23.800
They start with a digital
design, a CAD file, typically.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.550
And it could be electronics.

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:27.140
It could be physical.

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:31.720
And you can print locally on
your 3D printer or laser

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:32.810
cutter or CNC.

00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:35.370
Or you can print globally
by just uploading to

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:36.120
one of these services.

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:38.260
And the machines speak
the same language.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.600
In the desktop publishing
era, it was PostScript.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:42.590
So the machine on your desktop
spoke the same language as the

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:43.510
biggest printers in the world.

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:44.580
And now it's things
like [? Chico ?]

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:45.910
[? with their STLs. ?]

00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:48.470
It's the same language,
scale agnostic.

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:51.440
So we now have a scale-free
manufacturing system.

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:54.000
And that is the enabling
technology of the

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.550
long tail of stuff.

00:13:56.550 --> 00:14:00.730
OK, this is what I suddenly
realized when that

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:01.330
first box showed up.

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:05.440
I was like, oh my god!

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:06.600
I was meant to do this.

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:08.500
This is my grandfather.

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:09.850
His name is Fred Hauser.

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:11.640
I hadn't forgot about my
grandfather, but I'd forgotten

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:15.040
about this element of him
until this happened.

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:19.190
Fred Hauser was a Swiss engineer
who immigrated to Los

00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:24.130
Angeles in the late 1920s
and worked in Hollywood.

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:25.150
Hollywood was a very mechanical

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:27.030
business in those days.

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:29.280
The film transport,
lots of gears.

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:31.330
The audio was lots of
gears and pulleys

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:31.930
and things like that.

00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:36.830
And so it was a place for a
Swiss engineer good at gears.

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:39.260
But at night he was
an inventor.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:42.380
And this is what he
invented, the

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:43.800
automatic sprinkler system.

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:46.150
So if you have an automatic
sprinkler system, you have my

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:47.010
grandfather to thank.

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:49.410
By the way, this is exactly what
a Swiss engineer would

00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:51.210
invent if you put him in LA.

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:55.560
So LA is greening the deserts
with a sprinkler system.

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.020
And then the problem
is but you had to

00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:57.940
turn them on and off.

00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:00.400
And a Swiss engineer would just
put a watch on top of a

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:01.690
sprinkler systems.

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:03.670
And you know those dials
with the little pins

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:04.550
that you put in?

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:06.610
That's what he invented.

00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:07.770
So cool.

00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:09.980
That was great.

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:10.910
This was not so great.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.220
This is what you had to
do to get into market.

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:14.510
You had a patent it.

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:15.640
And he hated patenting.

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:16.340
It was expensive.

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:17.220
He hated working with lawyers.

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:18.440
It took forever.

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:21.430
But after you patented it,
you could license it to a

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:22.550
manufacturer.

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:25.910
And this is what was made, the
Moody Rain Master, which

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:29.120
allowed you to hang out at the
beach while your garden

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.130
watered itself.

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:34.030
And this is a huge
success, right?

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:36.950
This is a great victory of
20th century invention.

00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:39.970
His invention actually
made it to market.

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:41.990
He made some money.

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:42.670
This is good.

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:44.720
Almost nobody got this far.

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:48.460
But it's also a little tragic
in that he was an inventor,

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:50.510
but he wasn't an entrepreneur.

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:52.860
He never left his workshop.

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:54.430
He lost control of
his invention.

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:55.770
And it got made by
this company.

00:15:55.770 --> 00:15:57.500
And they changed it.

00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:59.490
And they kind of forgot
about him.

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:03.010
And I remember in the late
1970s, when I'd go visit him,

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:05.610
we went to see the factory.

00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:08.350
He was proud that his product
was being made.

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:10.780
And it was clear they couldn't
quite remember who he was and

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:11.470
why he was there.

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:13.740
And somebody finally reminded
them that this was Mr. Hauser

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:15.240
who had invented the
sprinkler system.

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:16.310
And they were all very polite.

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:18.470
But it was clear they didn't
need him, they didn't want him

00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:24.020
there, and that, once his
invention was done, that they

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:25.870
would take it from there.

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:27.990
Those who owned the factories,
those who owned the means of

00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:31.970
production still controlled
the product.

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:33.590
I spent my summers with him.

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:36.220
And he taught me how to do
mechanical drawing, which I've

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:38.440
entirely forgotten
at this point.

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:40.200
And then he taught me-- this
was kind of magical--

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:43.530
how to use a metal lathe
in a machine tool shop.

00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:45.040
One summer--

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:47.060
I think I was 12 this summer--

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:49.380
he said, this summer we're going
to make an engine, an

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:50.780
internal combustion engine.

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:51.500
And I was like, cool!

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.630
And he says, I've
ordered a kit.

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:56.200
So I show up and there's a
box there, sure enough.

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.540
And I knew what kits were.

00:16:57.540 --> 00:16:58.530
I'd built model airplanes.

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:01.850
There were lots of plastic
parts and numbers and

00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:02.770
instructions et cetera.

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:04.040
And we opened the box.

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:07.250
And there's these four blocks
of metal and a blueprint.

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:09.520
And I'm like, grandpa,
where's the engine?

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:13.030
And he's like, it's in there,
and we have to get it out.

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:13.859
And we did.

00:17:13.859 --> 00:17:14.609
We did.

00:17:14.609 --> 00:17:17.060
What a skilled machinist can do
is take blocks of metal and

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:18.050
put them on metal lathes.

00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:20.890
And curly-cues build up around
your feet, just like a

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:22.520
sculptor cutting away
the bit of marble

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:24.089
that isn't the figure.

00:17:24.089 --> 00:17:25.869
It's absolutely spectacular
and magical.

00:17:25.869 --> 00:17:29.680
And you can see that you could
make anything, if you have

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:30.880
those skills.

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:33.820
My grandfather was not just an
inventor, he was a machinist.

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:35.420
And you need to be a machinist
to take your

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:37.120
idea and make it real.

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.570
And so I realized at that point,
as I was looking at

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:42.000
this box full of motors that
showed up from China, and like

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:42.950
I made that.

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:44.330
Oh my god.

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:45.940
I can't believe I can do that.

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:48.590
Why had I forgotten that I'd
spent my summers with grandpa

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:49.330
making stuff?

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:50.910
And I realized it's because
I'm not a machinist.

00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:51.740
I didn't have those skills.

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:56.060
And I had no way to get my
ideas real, until now.

00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:57.780
So when you get a 3D printer--

00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:00.570
and my homework assignment for
any of you who have children,

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:03.180
but maybe even those that
don't, is get one--

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:04.000
it's mind blowing.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.940
But when you get a 3D printer
or a CNC machine or a laser

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:10.100
cutter or just want to use
these services, all those

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:13.620
skills that you used to
need to have go away.

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:14.060
They're abstracted.

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:15.790
The software handles that.

00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:20.040
And that barrier to entry of
making things real has

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:23.000
disappeared in the same way that
that Publish button on

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.980
Blogger et cetera took away
that barrier of entry of

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:28.030
having to own a printing
plant and understand

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:29.250
the publishing industry.

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:32.440
That is the magical thing here
is that, suddenly, there's

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:36.030
nothing standing between
ideas and practice.

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:41.000
And that step, right
now, is optional.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.970
There's a movie that came out
a few years ago called, "A

00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:45.870
Flash of Genius," that was kind
of a warning to those who

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:48.360
would pursue invention
in the 20th century.

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:50.600
This is about the invention of
the intermittent windshield

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:53.160
wiper, which is basically the
windshield wipers that pause

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.100
when it's not raining
very hard.

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:55.750
It's just a little
timer circuit.

00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:57.310
And there's a picture
from the movie.

00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:58.620
This is a guy, same
deal, just like my

00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:00.350
grandfather, in his basement.

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:01.520
Comes up with the invention.

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:03.490
He too patents it.

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:06.660
But rather than license it, he
decides that he wants to be an

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:07.400
entrepreneur.

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.750
He decides he wants
to make it too.

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:11.910
He wants to control his
invention, understandably.

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:13.130
Unfortunately, it was
really hard in those

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:13.980
days to make factories.

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:15.580
So he mortgages his house.

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:16.530
And he starts building
a factory.

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:18.110
He rents some space.

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:20.630
Assembly lines come
in, forklifts.

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:24.580
1961, '62, '63, he's
still not finished.

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:28.250
And in the movie, they portray
the scene where he's at 1964.

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:30.460
He's leaving his still
unfinished factory.

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:31.770
It's raining.

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:32.650
He's a little dejected.

00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:33.790
He turns the corner.

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:37.520
And the new 1965 Mustangs are
turning the corner to be

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:39.430
unveiled for the first time.

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:42.050
And their windshield
wipers are pausing.

00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:44.660
And he realizes that his
idea has been stolen.

00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:45.880
And he's ruined.

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:48.840
And his descent into
madness then fuels

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:49.690
the rest of the film.

00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:50.690
And it's all very
entertaining.

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:54.830
But the message was,
don't dare do that.

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:56.690
Don't be an entrepreneur
in the physical space.

00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:57.870
It's too hard.

00:19:57.870 --> 00:19:58.690
You need a factory.

00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:00.680
And factories are not for you.

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:02.990
So that's the way
it used to be.

00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:04.850
And this is the way it is now.

00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:06.050
Many of you may recognize
this.

00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:08.120
This is TechShop, just
down the road.

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:10.070
This is the new factory.

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:12.780
What you have here is
basically the gym.

00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:16.110
In the same way that a gym is
a place where, for a monthly

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:18.010
subscription fee, you get
access to machinery you

00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:20.990
couldn't afford or wouldn't want
in your house, training,

00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:24.340
other people who are doing the
same thing as an inspiration,

00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:26.640
this is that for
manufacturing.

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:29.930
You have access to 3D printers,
CNCs, laser cutters,

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:32.250
software tools, traditional
machining tools, all

00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:33.030
this kind of stuff.

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:34.370
They have trainers.

00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:35.440
They have classes.

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:36.990
They have other people doing
inspiring things.

00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:38.576
The guy here on the front is--

00:20:38.576 --> 00:20:42.660
I don't know whether my laser
pointer here works--

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:47.660
the guy here in the front here
is doing the wireless control

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:50.070
module for the smart grid.

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:53.900
The guy right there is doing a
vapor deposition chamber for

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:55.240
synthetic diamonds.

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:56.920
In the back, they're building
a lunar lander

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:59.520
because, why not?

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:02.650
And what's great is, because
they start on screen as

00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:05.420
digital files, they then do
some prototypes here.

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:08.370
And then they upload them to
the cloud, more or less.

00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:10.140
And they can be manufactured
at any scale.

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:12.350
This guy, interestingly, his
wireless control modules, when

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:15.780
he's done with them, they say
ABB, which is a big Swedish

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:16.990
engineering firm, on them.

00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:18.230
You probably think they're
made in a big Swedish

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:19.990
engineering factory,
but they're not.

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:25.370
They're made in small batches
by this guy and his team and

00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:26.770
simply distributed by ABB.

00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:30.670
But that's the power
of this model.

00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:33.470
Because these designs start
digital, and because the tools

00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:36.570
necessary to make them real are
so easy and accessible,

00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:39.360
that you get this kind
of long tail effect.

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:41.870
You get this explosion of
entrepreneurship and

00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:46.150
innovation happening in
using the web model.

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:50.990
This is a map of the current
spread of maker spaces or

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:52.750
hacker spaces.

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:54.490
A TechShop is a kind of
commercial chain.

00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:57.210
Actually, interestingly, the guy
who runs TechShop used to

00:21:57.210 --> 00:21:58.230
run Kinko's.

00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:01.590
And if you think of it, Kinko's
was the publishing

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:04.150
industry turned into a

00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:06.380
regionally distributed service.

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:08.340
And TechShop is the
manufacturing industry turned

00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:10.070
into a regionally distributed
service.

00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:12.080
And these maker spaces are
the same sort of thing.

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:13.910
They're places where you can go,
if you don't want to own

00:22:13.910 --> 00:22:16.920
your own 3D printer, laser
cutter, you can just have

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:19.500
access to one in a shared
environment.

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:20.600
So these are spreading
everywhere.

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:23.450
And this is very exciting that
it's not all clustered in the

00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:24.100
United States.

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:25.130
It can really happen anywhere.

00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:27.220
And things like the Fab Labs
that came out of MIT are a

00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:28.470
good example of this as well.

00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:32.900
The funding model, of course,
is Kickstarter.

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:34.930
I don't really need to tell you
more about Kickstarter and

00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:37.480
Pebble being one of the most
successful projects.

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:40.710
But basically, it does
three magical things.

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:42.690
The first magical thing
Kickstarter does is it moves

00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:44.600
money forward in time.

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:48.350
When you think about it, the
traditional method of

00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:50.940
manufacturing has got that whole
monetary flow all wrong,

00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:53.440
which is, basically, you pay a
lot of money up front to do

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:57.010
your R&amp;D and your prototyping
and your tooling.

00:22:57.010 --> 00:22:59.320
And then you have to assemble
your components and inventory

00:22:59.320 --> 00:22:59.820
your components.

00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:01.950
Then you have to build
the devices.

00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:03.440
Then you have to
warehouse them.

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:05.550
Then you have to put them into
the distribution channel.

00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:07.100
Then they sell.

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:07.990
Then they go through this.

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:09.370
Then the money comes in.

00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:11.740
Most of it gets taken away
by third-parties.

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:12.950
And then you get paid.

00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:14.990
So you have to spend all
your money at the

00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:15.880
front end of the process.

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:18.550
And you get some of it at the
back end of the process.

00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:21.220
And by simply taking pre-orders,
they move the

00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:23.870
money forward in time
to when you need it.

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:24.260
So that's great.

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:25.230
That's one thing.

00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:27.820
Number two is market research.

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:29.950
As you know, you have to pass
your goal to get approved.

00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:31.860
Now, in this case, the
goal was 100,000.

00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:33.780
The kind of blew through
that one.

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:38.290
But if they hadn't, that
would have been a gift.

00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:40.780
If you don't hit your goal,
that tells you the product

00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:41.780
probably would not have sold.

00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:43.490
And you just saved yourself
a ton of time

00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:45.130
and money right there.

00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:47.780
So free market research
is golden.

00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:48.820
And number three--

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:52.245
and this is the most important
thing, I think--

00:23:52.245 --> 00:23:54.000
is that it builds a community.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.110
And this is a community
of customers,

00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:58.270
but not just customers.

00:23:58.270 --> 00:24:00.240
They're also co-participants
in the

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.550
product development itself.

00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:03.650
So if that was you that followed
the Pebble watch--

00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:05.713
how many here backed
the Pebble watch?

00:24:05.713 --> 00:24:06.640
OK, a few of you.

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:07.030
Yeah.

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:09.630
I'm really looking forward
to this one.

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:12.350
Trust me, it'll come,
sooner or later.

00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:12.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:14.570
To starter projects, they're
notoriously late.

00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:17.610
That's part of the fun is just
listening to the explanations

00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:19.200
of why things have
been delayed.

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:21.330
Very educational into the
learning process of

00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:23.180
manufacturing.

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:28.170
So as those of you who backed
will remember, the community,

00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:30.960
after they backed this product,
started making

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:31.510
suggestions.

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:33.660
We'd like it to be
more waterproof.

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:36.290
The four guys in Palo Alto
said, OK, we can do that.

00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:38.290
They said, well, we'd like
it to be Bluetooth 4, not

00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:39.190
Bluetooth 3.

00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:39.580
Got you.

00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:40.850
Done.

00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:41.680
We'd like a new color.

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:42.310
Fine.

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:43.000
Done.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.940
And what that means is that
now these customers have a

00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:48.490
little bit of themselves
in the product.

00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:51.870
They're not just buyers,
they're backers.

00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:53.110
They are participants.

00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:55.950
They are co-creators of
something that's not just a

00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:57.990
watch, it's a movement.

00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:59.410
It's something they
believe in.

00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:02.830
And they become evangelists
and then marketers.

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:05.510
It's not just the moment of
backing, when you Tweet that I

00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:09.050
just backed whatsoever on
Kickstarter, but also, because

00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:11.930
they not only have bought into
this and made a bet on

00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:14.750
something before it exists, but
also contributed, many of

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:18.650
them, to its essence, they
really want this to succeed.

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:20.000
And they will promote
it in a way that no

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.400
regular customer would.

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:25.110
So it's a simple thing,
Kickstarter, pre-orders,

00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:27.260
threshold, comments.

00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:30.740
And what is created is a crowd
funding model that is

00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:32.860
perfectly suited for the
industrialization

00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:36.090
of the Maker Movement.

00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:38.690
What these tools mean, so in the
same way that that first

00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:41.155
desktop publishing software and
that first printer meant

00:25:41.155 --> 00:25:44.260
that you were a publisher, but
you have to get good at it,

00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:47.970
and we made these horrible
messes of font, dog's

00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:50.820
breakfast of fonts, and we knew
nothing about letting and

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:53.160
kerning and flow and
wrap-around, but we got

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:56.620
better, we learned, and
ultimately, we got pretty good

00:25:56.620 --> 00:26:00.180
at it, we're right there with
CAD and manufacturing and

00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:01.120
everything else.

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:03.100
It's like we're, small
d, designers.

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:05.470
Just like we became, small p,
publishers the moment we hit

00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:08.680
that Publish button, we're
now, small d, designers.

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:13.460
And hundreds of years of
industrial skills and

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:16.930
education are now turned
into software apps.

00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:19.380
I mentioned that my grandfather
invented the

00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:20.200
automatic sprinkler system.

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:21.970
As kind of a thought experiment
I said, well, what

00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:23.750
would grandpa do today?

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:25.060
How would he invent
the automatic

00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:26.470
sprinkler system today?

00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:28.870
And so this really was a
thought, I can remember,

00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:30.120
because I don't even
have a garden.

00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:34.770
So I just said, what
would an open

00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:36.110
sprinkler look like today?

00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:38.630
And I worked with a couple
of guys online.

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:41.350
And this is what we
came up with.

00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:45.970
It is an Arduino-based internet
of things sprinkler.

00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:49.820
And we started to ask questions
like, well, again,

00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:51.000
how would you improve
sprinklers?

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.330
And well, obviously, sprinklers
should be connected

00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:54.560
to the web, so if it's going to
rain tomorrow, it doesn't

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:55.290
water today.

00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:58.190
Obviously, you should be able to
turn it off with your phone

00:26:58.190 --> 00:26:59.350
or any other device.

00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:00.370
Obviously, you should
be able to plug in

00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:02.320
any sensor you want.

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:06.550
Obviously, it should talk to
other devices in your house.

00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:08.480
Obviously, it should be open,
so anybody can build a

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:10.630
community around it or find
new applications.

00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:13.460
By the way, it turned out that
we then made it and sold it.

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:15.870
It turns out the number one
customer for this is

00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:17.520
hydroponic pot growers.

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:18.435
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:18.435 --> 00:27:20.740
CHRIS ANDERSON: Who turn out
to have very demanding

00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:21.620
sprinkler needs.

00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:22.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:22.390 --> 00:27:24.290
CHRIS ANDERSON: I had no idea.

00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:28.720
But so this just an example of
what a guy who knows nothing

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:31.860
about sprinklers and a couple of
other people on the web who

00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:33.500
had never met can do.

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:35.530
And I'm not saying this
is the best sprinkler.

00:27:35.530 --> 00:27:37.650
It's certainly not the
only web-connected

00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:38.600
sprinkler out there.

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:41.410
But the point is that we did
this in a couple of weekends.

00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:44.010
And it's actually better than a
lot of the stuff you can buy

00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:44.265
commercially.

00:27:44.265 --> 00:27:47.280
And it costs like $70 And
there's no service fee for

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:49.810
access to the weather reports,
because it's the web.

00:27:49.810 --> 00:27:53.340
So that was my introduction
into this whole thing.

00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:56.860
And I was realizing, I really
have no business doing this.

00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:58.470
And yet, here I am doing it.

00:27:58.470 --> 00:28:00.700
I didn't have any business
ordering motors from China,

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:01.550
and there I was.

00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:03.140
I didn't have any business doing
a sprinkler system, and

00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:03.800
there it was.

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:05.290
And it's so easy.

00:28:05.290 --> 00:28:09.310
And this made me realize that,
if I could do it, anybody can.

00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:14.050
These are the tools
that we used.

00:28:14.050 --> 00:28:15.360
CAD used to be super hard.

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:18.070
It's still not super easy,
but it's getting easier.

00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:19.100
And they're free.

00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:21.840
Autodesk 123D is one
free example.

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:24.800
And the reason I'm showing you
this is that there's something

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:26.843
that, again, is kind
of mind blowing, if

00:28:26.843 --> 00:28:27.760
you think about it.

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:31.100
So in your word processor menu,
in Word or whatever, you

00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:32.870
go to the File menu,
and there's an

00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:33.580
item that says, Print.

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:36.000
And when you press Print, paper

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.170
comes out of this machine.

00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:39.475
And we think nothing
of it, right?

00:28:39.475 --> 00:28:40.120
It's a printer.

00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:42.180
That's what they do.

00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:46.570
Well, it is kind of magical, the
whole PostScript and atoms

00:28:46.570 --> 00:28:48.730
into bits, sorry, bits
into atoms, and all

00:28:48.730 --> 00:28:49.120
that kind of stuff.

00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:50.990
But nevertheless, we're
used to it.

00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:54.122
Well, of these CAD software
programs now have a menu item

00:28:54.122 --> 00:28:57.305
that says, Make.

00:28:57.305 --> 00:28:59.140
By the way, this was
the enclosure for

00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:00.050
the sprinkler system.

00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:01.750
This was my first CAD project.

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:03.000
It turned out my walls
were too thin.

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:08.290
But once I did it-- and this
took me like 20 minutes-- then

00:29:08.290 --> 00:29:09.420
you go to the Make.

00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:12.370
And then there's this software
wizard that walks you through

00:29:12.370 --> 00:29:14.910
these choices.

00:29:14.910 --> 00:29:16.980
Do you want to output it locally
on your own machine?

00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:19.430
Or do you want to upload it to
a service in the cloud that

00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:21.090
will do it for you in high

00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:22.780
resolution with better materials?

00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:25.350
Do you want to do it in
2D on a laser cutter?

00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:28.350
Or do you want to do it
in 3D on a 3D printer?

00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:30.110
How much you want to pay?

00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:32.720
What kind of material properties
do you want?

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:34.310
What are the volume
considerations?

00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:35.160
How big do you want to be?

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:36.780
There's some cost
aspects to that.

00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:39.450
And so, basically, this kind of
stuff that used to be and

00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:44.230
still is professional engineers,
entire industries

00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:46.570
focused on walking you through,
they're focused on

00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:50.830
doing this, of turning an idea
into a product, is now a

00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:55.560
software wizard that's just
built into the program.

00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:57.800
This is kind of,
again, amazing.

00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:59.440
This stuff used to
be really hard.

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:00.400
And now it just walks
you through it.

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:01.240
And you put in your
credit card.

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:03.330
It's like Picasa.

00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:04.900
Do you want to print your photo

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:06.250
locally on your own printer?

00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:08.870
Or do you want to upload
it to a service to be

00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:09.910
turned into a book?

00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:12.560
It's your choice, print
one, print 100.

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:13.900
One's free, the other
has a credit card.

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:16.260
But it's really just a matter of
click here or click there.

00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:19.300
And now we're doing the same
thing for manufacturing.

00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:22.470
My daughters are one
of the big users of

00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:23.530
all this in our household.

00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:26.790
They're really into The
Sims, which is a

00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:28.660
really cool video game.

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:29.560
It's basically a dollhouse.

00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:30.500
You build a house.

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:32.240
You populate it with figures
and furniture.

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:35.000
And you design something
that's just right.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:35.680
A lot of fun.

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:37.780
But we're kind of fascist when
it comes to video game time.

00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:40.460
And they get two hours
per weekend day.

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:42.650
And when the two hours are up,
it's like, screen off.

00:30:42.650 --> 00:30:43.860
You've got to go play
in the real world.

00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:45.980
By the way, you have a real
dollhouse, so why don't you

00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:47.200
play with that?

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:50.050
And they're like, yeah.

00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:51.450
So it's not as cool.

00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:51.770
Look.

00:30:51.770 --> 00:30:53.270
We've been designing
this mad man

00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:55.500
theme in our Sims dollhouse.

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:57.010
And our dollhouse furniture
is all wrong.

00:30:57.010 --> 00:31:00.290
Dad, will you buy me some
new dollhouse furniture?

00:31:00.290 --> 00:31:01.320
So I've heard that before.

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:02.370
And I'm usually pretty good.

00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:03.480
No, but I wanted to do
a little research.

00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:04.920
So I go on Amazon.

00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:07.850
And it turns out the dollhouse
furniture is A, super

00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:10.750
expensive, B, very little
choice, you can never get the

00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:13.380
right style, and C, it's
always the wrong size.

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:15.280
It turns out there's
no standard size

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:17.070
in dollhouse furniture.

00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:18.790
And you can't even tell whether
it's the right size.

00:31:18.790 --> 00:31:20.450
And it turns out the houses
and the figures are not

00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:22.520
actually scaled exactly
the same.

00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:23.210
And very complicated.

00:31:23.210 --> 00:31:25.220
And lots of disappointment
lies ahead.

00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:27.090
However, we have a Maker box.

00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:28.090
We have a 3D printer.

00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:29.590
So we go to Thingiverse.

00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:31.590
And this is the coolest thing.

00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:37.990
This New York set designer, a
theatrical set designer, goes

00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:40.080
by the name of
PrettySmallThings, has

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:43.110
uploaded the most beautiful
dollhouse furniture designs

00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:44.220
for free on Thingiverse.

00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:46.490
And we found a chair that
was just right.

00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:48.920
And then we printed it out.

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:51.030
And then the four-year-old
painted it.

00:31:51.030 --> 00:31:54.440
And they love their dollhouse
furniture now.

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:56.840
So if you're a toy company,
this should

00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:59.680
fill you with terror.

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:02.910
We basically did
this for free.

00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:04.060
The kids were super engaged.

00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:06.060
They got exactly what they
wanted and, by the way, at

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:07.200
exactly the right size.

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:08.890
There's little sliders,
so you scale so it's

00:32:08.890 --> 00:32:09.990
just the right size.

00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:11.930
Then they made it their
own with the painting.

00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:12.990
And they love this stuff.

00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:13.750
They treasure it.

00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:15.370
They actually take the doll's
furniture out of the dollhouse

00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:17.930
and they put it on their window
sill, because they're

00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:19.250
so proud of their dollhouse
furniture.

00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:22.870
They don't feel that way about
stuff they buy at Walmart.

00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:25.130
So is it better than the stuff
they buy in the Walmart?

00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:25.800
No.

00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:27.620
But it's righter for my kids.

00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:29.760
And there's something
of them in it.

00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:32.100
In the same way that buying
something from Kickstarter,

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:33.280
there's a little something
of you in it.

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:34.830
You care more about it than
you did from something you

00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:35.640
bought in a store.

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:39.660
It's something that you 3D
printed and then maybe painted

00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:42.500
or customized.

00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:43.740
There's a connection
you have there.

00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:46.280
You value this more than
something that's

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:47.950
mass-produced.

00:32:47.950 --> 00:32:49.820
We've seen this before
in music, right?

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:51.100
The best music is
the stuff that

00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:52.810
everybody else isn't into.

00:32:52.810 --> 00:32:55.720
That's the story of the long
tail is that appealing to your

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:59.660
individual needs, appealing to
what defines you as a person

00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:01.640
makes you value things more.

00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:06.340
Artisanal food, we get it.

00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:07.860
We're past one-size-fits-all.

00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:12.400
And this is very much a
one-size-fits-one approach to

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:13.830
dollhouse furniture.

00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:18.870
My boys, needless to say, are
into Warhammer 40K mechs.

00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:21.995
Same deal, download the design,
print it out, paint

00:33:21.995 --> 00:33:23.245
it, customize it.

00:33:25.690 --> 00:33:28.650
Not as good as an official
Warhammer 40K mech, but

00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:30.720
exactly what they want.

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:32.610
Now that's just in our house.

00:33:32.610 --> 00:33:35.070
I don't know what the killer
app for 3D printers is.

00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:38.970
But I do know that, when you
give a kid a 3D printer and

00:33:38.970 --> 00:33:40.830
they have access to Thingiverse
and easy tools to

00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:45.590
customize, that the imagination
runs riot.

00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:47.790
And what these kids know is
that anything they could

00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:48.840
imagine they can make real.

00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:51.560
Right now, they can make it real
in plastic in one color.

00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:53.380
Soon it'll be plastic
and multicolors.

00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:56.300
Soon it will be much
higher resolution.

00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:57.550
Soon it'll be multi-material.

00:33:57.550 --> 00:33:59.330
Then they'll be able
to integrate the

00:33:59.330 --> 00:34:01.130
electronics into it.

00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:02.370
They'll be able to
print in metal.

00:34:02.370 --> 00:34:04.060
We can see the way
this is going.

00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:07.480
It's not going to take 20 years
to get professional

00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:11.420
quality manufacturing
on your desktop.

00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:12.739
We've been in the dot
matrix period.

00:34:12.739 --> 00:34:16.290
We're now in the
inject period.

00:34:16.290 --> 00:34:18.139
We're going to get better,
faster, because it's built on

00:34:18.139 --> 00:34:21.390
the same technologies as
traditional printing.

00:34:21.390 --> 00:34:24.199
You know how Apple's slogan,
when it released

00:34:24.199 --> 00:34:25.290
the iPod, was "Rip.

00:34:25.290 --> 00:34:25.889
Mix.

00:34:25.889 --> 00:34:28.370
Burn." And that changed
the music industry.

00:34:28.370 --> 00:34:31.250
The idea that you could take
music, professional music, and

00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:33.909
you could rip it, bring
it into your computer.

00:34:33.909 --> 00:34:35.550
Then you could change
it, mix it.

00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:38.080
Then you could produce it.

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:39.510
Then you could make your
own CDs and distribute

00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:41.790
them and burn them.

00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:45.340
That idea, that sense of
control, that sense that the

00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:48.190
tools of production now were
within your reach, that was

00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:49.650
incredibly powerful.

00:34:49.650 --> 00:34:51.699
And it was scary for
the music industry.

00:34:51.699 --> 00:34:55.489
But it also unleashed this
explosion of creativity and

00:34:55.489 --> 00:34:57.460
changed the music industry,
I think, for the better.

00:34:57.460 --> 00:34:59.150
Adobe's slogan is "Rip.

00:34:59.150 --> 00:34:59.510
Mod.

00:34:59.510 --> 00:35:02.380
Make." And what does
that mean?

00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:04.760
How do you rip physical stuff?

00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:08.750
And the answer is called
reality capture.

00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:11.670
Right now, what you're seeing
right there is an app which is

00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:15.430
free on iPhone or IOS,
iPhone and iPad,

00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:17.480
which uses the camera.

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:18.320
You just take pictures.

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:19.520
You move around an object
and go click, click,

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:20.600
click, click, click.

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:22.400
It sends the pictures
up into the cloud.

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:23.630
It stitches them together.

00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:27.810
And then it generates
a polygon mesh.

00:35:27.810 --> 00:35:30.020
It's scans reality.

00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:33.200
We can now capture reality, at
relatively low resolution, but

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:33.770
they get better.

00:35:33.770 --> 00:35:36.580
So 3D scanning, which used to be
really hard, is now a free

00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:38.500
app in your phone.

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:41.260
And what you do with it is
you then output the mesh.

00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:41.830
You then clean the mesh up.

00:35:41.830 --> 00:35:43.390
And then you, of course, print
your head as a Pez dispenser,

00:35:43.390 --> 00:35:44.370
as one does.

00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:46.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:46.740
CHRIS ANDERSON: That's "Rip.

00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:47.140
Mod.

00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:48.010
Make," right?

00:35:48.010 --> 00:35:49.760
OK, it's a trivial example,
but think how

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:51.930
powerful that is.

00:35:51.930 --> 00:35:54.600
We don't have to learn CAD
tools, we can just capture

00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:58.300
reality and fix it, make it our
own, adapt it, and then

00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:01.010
print it in whatever
material we want.

00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:02.920
We saw what it did to
the music industry.

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:05.255
Just imagine what this might
do to everything else.

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:09.630
Let's pull back.

00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:11.530
What does this mean
for the world?

00:36:11.530 --> 00:36:12.930
Was does this mean
for industry?

00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:15.450
What does this mean
for the economy?

00:36:15.450 --> 00:36:19.480
I started by saying that the
real revolution of the web was

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:21.810
the innovation model, the fact
that we were able to bring

00:36:21.810 --> 00:36:24.420
everybody in and get them
to work together.

00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:28.050
And we now have an opportunity
do this with physical goods.

00:36:28.050 --> 00:36:30.720
I think what this creates is a
different kind of company.

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:33.380
The guy on the left here
is Ronald Coase.

00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:36.860
He was the University of Chicago
economist who came up

00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:38.683
with the, so-called,
Theory of the Firm.

00:36:38.683 --> 00:36:42.770
In the 1930s, he was puzzling
over the question, why do

00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:44.160
companies exist.

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:48.830
Why do we go to work under one
roof and for one company and

00:36:48.830 --> 00:36:52.140
with one job description and
with an aligned mission?

00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:53.180
Why do we do that?

00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:56.000
Why have we created
the corporation?

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.190
And he came up with the theory
of transaction costs.

00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:01.160
We work for a company.

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:04.140
You guys sit here and work for
Google, because it's the

00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:05.600
fastest way to get
things done.

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:07.730
Transaction costs are the costs
of communicating with

00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:08.420
each other.

00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:10.317
And because each of you has a
role and responsibility, you

00:37:10.317 --> 00:37:11.970
know who does what.

00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:14.490
So Accounts Receivable is here
and Accounts Payable is there.

00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:17.910
And you know how to find the
person to get stuff done.

00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:19.400
That's great.

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:22.370
20th century thanks
you for that.

00:37:22.370 --> 00:37:23.380
And it worked fine.

00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:25.360
However, the guy on the right,
Bill Joy, one of the

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:28.950
co-founders of Sun Microsystems,
accepted that.

00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:30.270
And he worked for a company.

00:37:30.270 --> 00:37:33.250
But he did reflect on one of
the truisms, which is, he

00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:35.800
said, "Whoever you are, the
smartest people in the world

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:38.030
don't work for you." This is
probably the one place in the

00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:38.680
world where that's not true.

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:39.626
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:39.626 --> 00:37:42.250
CHRIS ANDERSON: But it was
generally a truism, which is

00:37:42.250 --> 00:37:45.690
to say, statistically speaking,
for any given job,

00:37:45.690 --> 00:37:48.495
the smartest person in the world
is not the person who

00:37:48.495 --> 00:37:50.460
has that defined role and
responsibility and is in the

00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:51.650
cubicle next to you.

00:37:51.650 --> 00:37:53.270
They're probably out
there somewhere.

00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:56.365
They're probably in China or
India or whatever, but how are

00:37:56.365 --> 00:37:57.060
you going to find them?

00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:58.070
Right?

00:37:58.070 --> 00:38:01.480
The transaction costs of finding
the statistically

00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:05.530
smartest person in the world for
that job are too high, so

00:38:05.530 --> 00:38:07.840
you settle for the
one you're with.

00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:09.420
By the way, if you think about
it, this is probably true for

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:10.850
your spouse as well.

00:38:10.850 --> 00:38:11.740
And we just--

00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:12.250
don't go there.

00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:12.713
You go absolutely crazy.

00:38:12.713 --> 00:38:13.176
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:13.176 --> 00:38:15.700
CHRIS ANDERSON: You know, the
odds of the perfect person for

00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:19.000
you happened to grow up in your
town, so we love the one

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.800
we're with.

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:25.400
However, that's sub-optimal.

00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:30.420
It's like what we do with things
like what school did

00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:33.690
you go to, what grades did you
get, let me see your CV, your

00:38:33.690 --> 00:38:36.930
track record, let's get the
references, are you available,

00:38:36.930 --> 00:38:38.440
do you speak the right language,
do you have the

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:42.430
right visa, those are not
talent-optimizing.

00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:43.980
They are basically
access-optimizing.

00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:46.040
What we do is we're settling
for the safest

00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:47.170
person in the world.

00:38:47.170 --> 00:38:49.740
We know this person
can do the job.

00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:53.550
And the 20th century talent
filters were largely oriented

00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:57.180
around minimizing the difficulty
in finding someone

00:38:57.180 --> 00:38:58.250
who could do the job.

00:38:58.250 --> 00:38:59.930
But we didn't end up with
the right person.

00:38:59.930 --> 00:39:02.480
We didn't end up with the
best person for the job.

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:05.820
So I wanted to end with a story
about my own little

00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:08.740
adventure in this and how we may
have solved Joy's paradox.

00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:11.970
This is the cover of "Make
Magazine," which is the Bible

00:39:11.970 --> 00:39:15.780
of the movement, the
Maker Movement.

00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:19.630
And my little adventure with
my children, starting with

00:39:19.630 --> 00:39:21.540
blimps, went down
the rabbit hole.

00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:23.150
I'll show you in
a few minutes.

00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:24.780
But I ended up getting
into drums.

00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:26.590
And I built a community.

00:39:26.590 --> 00:39:29.000
And I met that guy there,
Jordi Munoz.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.880
And I just want to tell a little
story about Jordi And

00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:32.480
then we'll end.

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:35.660
And we'll take questions.

00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:38.240
So my own adventure with this
started with trying to get my

00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:39.900
kids interested in science
and technology.

00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:42.460
I started a site called GeekDad,
which is now run by

00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:42.920
other people.

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:47.170
But this is my eternal and
eternally unsuccessful quest,

00:39:47.170 --> 00:39:49.560
to get my kids more geeky.

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:52.740
I've got five kids.

00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:57.580
And every weekend I'd try to
find science and technology

00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:00.980
projects that were fun for
them and fun for me.

00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:04.180
So one Friday at the office at
"Wired," we got in a LEGO

00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:04.810
Mindstorms kit.

00:40:04.810 --> 00:40:06.620
And this was right before
they came out.

00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:07.710
So we got one of
the first ones.

00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:09.220
And we got a radio controlled
airplane.

00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:11.570
I thought, best weekend
ever, right?

00:40:11.570 --> 00:40:15.660
So on Saturday, we're going to
make a robot out of LEGO.

00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:17.250
And on Sunday, we're going to
fly a plane in the park.

00:40:17.250 --> 00:40:18.980
How could this go wrong?

00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:19.880
This is Erin.

00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:21.410
She was nine.

00:40:21.410 --> 00:40:23.070
She's building the first
project of the LEGO

00:40:23.070 --> 00:40:23.530
Mindstorms.

00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:24.065
It's a tripod.

00:40:24.065 --> 00:40:26.090
It's a three-wheeled robot.

00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:28.690
And what you do is you put
together the robot.

00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:32.660
And then you use this visual
programming language built on

00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:33.330
[? LabVIEW ?]

00:40:33.330 --> 00:40:34.820
to program it.

00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:38.440
And there's Daniel, 11.

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:41.630
And he's getting ready to
push the button and see

00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:42.950
whether it will work.

00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:48.125
So what it does is it goes
forward until it sees a wall.

00:40:48.125 --> 00:40:50.590
And then it backs up.

00:40:50.590 --> 00:40:53.410
And my kids are like, you've
got to be kidding.

00:40:53.410 --> 00:40:56.380
We've seen "Transformers."
We know what robots

00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:57.030
are supposed to do.

00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:58.570
Where are the lasers?

00:40:58.570 --> 00:41:00.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:03.580
CHRIS ANDERSON: This is not a
death-dealing, three-story

00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:06.170
killing machine.

00:41:06.170 --> 00:41:08.570
Hollywood has ruined robotics
for children.

00:41:08.570 --> 00:41:11.440
You cannot compete with CG.

00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:13.590
So they were really
disappointed and

00:41:13.590 --> 00:41:14.520
lost interest entirely.

00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:16.820
And so I was a little
upset about that.

00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:17.870
So I said OK--

00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:20.850
that was Saturday-- on Sunday,
we're going to fly a plane.

00:41:20.850 --> 00:41:21.970
This is the plane we got.

00:41:21.970 --> 00:41:22.950
And so we went to the park.

00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:24.170
And we'd seen YouTube videos.

00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:25.700
And it looked awfully cool.

00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:28.430
And this is what happened.

00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:29.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:29.350 --> 00:41:31.710
CHRIS ANDERSON: So I flew
it into a tree.

00:41:31.710 --> 00:41:34.160
And if that weren't humiliating
enough, it was dad

00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:36.260
climbing into the tree to get
it back, which is completely

00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:37.000
mortifying.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:37.730
And.

00:41:37.730 --> 00:41:39.560
I had to bribe them
with ice cream.

00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:41.800
And it was a bad scene.

00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:43.700
And once again, they were
reminded that any time Dad

00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:45.590
wants to do science and
technology projects, it ends

00:41:45.590 --> 00:41:47.790
up as a disaster.

00:41:47.790 --> 00:41:49.760
So I was kind of annoyed
about the whole thing.

00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:51.840
And went for a run
to clear my head.

00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:52.830
And I was out there thinking.

00:41:52.830 --> 00:41:57.670
I was like, phew, that sucked.

00:41:57.670 --> 00:41:59.180
A, the robots weren't
very fun.

00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:01.010
They just ran into a wall.

00:42:01.010 --> 00:42:03.073
And B, I can't fly.

00:42:03.073 --> 00:42:05.620
I thought, god, I'll bet the
LEGO could have flown that

00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:07.870
plane better than me.

00:42:07.870 --> 00:42:10.410
And then I thought about the
sensors that came in the kit.

00:42:10.410 --> 00:42:14.310
And it came with a gyro sensor
and accelerometer, it's called

00:42:14.310 --> 00:42:17.515
tilt sensor, and a magnetometer,
which is called

00:42:17.515 --> 00:42:20.520
a compass sensor, and a
Bluetooth connection.

00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:22.650
And I was like, oh my god,
you could almost build an

00:42:22.650 --> 00:42:24.000
auto-pilot out of this.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:24.600
So I came back.

00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:27.280
And I said, OK, kids,
one last thing.

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:29.420
We're going to build
an auto-pilot.

00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:30.950
And this is what we
came up with.

00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:34.415
And this is a LEGO auto-pilot.

00:42:34.415 --> 00:42:37.190
It's got gyros, accelerometers,
magnetometers,

00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:38.400
a RC interface.

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:40.210
It actually runs a
common filter.

00:42:40.210 --> 00:42:43.030
I actually had to Google
common filter.

00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:47.290
That was actually harder than
I expected to implement.

00:42:47.290 --> 00:42:50.660
I knew nothing about this, but
it kind of almost worked.

00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:52.500
We put it in a plane.

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:55.080
It actually kind of
flew on its own.

00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:57.890
This we had posted on Slashdot
this is, I think, technically,

00:42:57.890 --> 00:43:01.670
the world's first LEGO unmanned
aerial vehicle, UAV.

00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:05.930
It's now in the LEGO museum
in Billund, which

00:43:05.930 --> 00:43:07.380
we're very proud of.

00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:13.010
The kids and I got to go to
LEGO, to Billund for that.

00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:14.720
And we learned a
lot about this.

00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:20.510
We learned A, that this stuff
is not that hard, B, that

00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:23.460
what's going on with the
smartphone revolution, what's

00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:27.020
going on in your pocket that the
revolution in MEM sensors

00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:30.690
and ARM processors and GPS and
wireless and cameras and

00:43:30.690 --> 00:43:35.990
memory and integration, all
this kind of stuff, this

00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:38.460
driving a technological wave
that we've only seen the

00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:39.730
beginnings of.

00:43:39.730 --> 00:43:42.810
I just realized, thanks to
Mindstorms, that you can fly a

00:43:42.810 --> 00:43:44.780
747 with this.

00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:47.270
With the right app and the right
cable, you've got a--

00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:49.440
not terribly well, I wouldn't
recommend it--

00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:50.860
but you've got all it takes.

00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:54.350
And that just as Jobs and
Wozniak realized that

00:43:54.350 --> 00:43:58.250
original, what was it, an 8088
processor, et cetera, was

00:43:58.250 --> 00:44:00.600
available, and relatively
cheap and easy to use.

00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:02.380
And then you could, maybe, build
a computer out of it.

00:44:02.380 --> 00:44:03.810
And that ended up with
the Apple II

00:44:03.810 --> 00:44:05.110
and changed the world.

00:44:05.110 --> 00:44:08.040
We're right there with
the guts of a

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:08.660
smartphone right now.

00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:11.120
It has extraordinary
applications outside.

00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:13.960
And being able to fly a plane
is just one of them.

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:15.890
Now, in the course of doing
this, we learned a lot.

00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:18.950
We learned that auto-pilots are
considered cruise missile

00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:22.240
controllers by the State
Department's International

00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:25.500
Trade in Arms Regulations,
ITAR.

00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:30.190
And that's by my nine-year-old
developing an auto-pilot and

00:44:30.190 --> 00:44:32.942
putting it online that we,
technically, weaponized LEGO.

00:44:32.942 --> 00:44:34.238
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:34.238 --> 00:44:37.890
CHRIS ANDERSON: So it was quite
a learning process.

00:44:37.890 --> 00:44:40.480
So what I did is I decided
to just learn in public.

00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:43.340
So I started a community called
DIY Drones and just

00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:44.470
basically shared my ignorance.

00:44:44.470 --> 00:44:45.450
I knew nothing.

00:44:45.450 --> 00:44:48.180
And I just kept asking dumb
questions like, what's a

00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:49.970
common filter?

00:44:49.970 --> 00:44:52.650
And digital electronics, and
analog electronics, and

00:44:52.650 --> 00:44:56.720
aerodynamics, and dynamic
systems, and control theory,

00:44:56.720 --> 00:45:00.420
and I knew nothing about this.

00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:01.500
Everything I found, I shared.

00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:03.040
And people kept answering
my questions.

00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:05.030
And today, we're one of the
biggest robotics communities

00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:06.280
in the world.

00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:12.040
And people here at Google who
are probably members, and

00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:13.890
Apple, and Microsoft,
and IBM, et cetera.

00:45:13.890 --> 00:45:16.420
And by day, they do
awesome work here.

00:45:16.420 --> 00:45:19.060
And by night, they do awesome
work in auto-pilots and

00:45:19.060 --> 00:45:21.250
drones, et cetera, because
they're really into it.

00:45:21.250 --> 00:45:26.500
And we ended up, by accident,
competing with

00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:28.560
the aerospace industry.

00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:29.460
This is what we do.

00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:31.660
We make these auto-pilots
right now.

00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:34.120
We work with ETH in Zurich.

00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:36.390
The Swiss, by the way, turned
out-- thank you, grandpa--

00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:39.570
turned out to be the leaders in
robotics, because all those

00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:41.770
watch makers had extraordinary
mechanical skills.

00:45:41.770 --> 00:45:43.350
And robots used to
be mechanical.

00:45:43.350 --> 00:45:45.830
And now ETH and EPFL, which
are the two leading

00:45:45.830 --> 00:45:48.570
universities-- it's like
the MIT and Stanford--

00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:50.770
when I asked them to make that
connection, they say, well no,

00:45:50.770 --> 00:45:52.233
the most important thing is one
is German-speaking and one

00:45:52.233 --> 00:45:54.080
is French-speaking, so you can't
really make the MIT,

00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:55.140
Stanford connection.

00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:56.520
But anyway, they're
really good.

00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:57.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:00.880
CHRIS ANDERSON: And so anyway,
we work with them.

00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:04.820
And this is the stuff
we make now.

00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:08.850
This is like military grade
auto-pilots which are built on

00:46:08.850 --> 00:46:14.010
smartphone chips and
sell for $140.

00:46:14.010 --> 00:46:17.180
The Parrott AR.Drone, which some
of you may have and is a

00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:20.210
lovely piece of gear, it's a
quadricopter that you can

00:46:20.210 --> 00:46:22.990
control with an iPhone
or an Android.

00:46:22.990 --> 00:46:24.940
It's not really a drone,
I hate to tell you.

00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:28.200
Drones are autonomous, fully
autonomous, automatic takeoff,

00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:30.710
landing, missions, GPS
coordinates, et cetera.

00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:31.590
Our drone is teleoperated.

00:46:31.590 --> 00:46:33.210
It's remote control.

00:46:33.210 --> 00:46:36.810
Unless you rip out the guts and
put in our stuff, and then

00:46:36.810 --> 00:46:38.290
it's a real drone.

00:46:38.290 --> 00:46:41.450
So that's where we're
going on this.

00:46:41.450 --> 00:46:46.180
Just a little segue into why
this is happening now.

00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:48.290
It turns out that these
multi-copters, these

00:46:48.290 --> 00:46:51.080
quadricopters, are basically
solid state devices.

00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:53.370
But they don't have any moving
parts, except for the motors

00:46:53.370 --> 00:46:53.850
themselves.

00:46:53.850 --> 00:46:57.260
But they were not possible
until about a decade ago,

00:46:57.260 --> 00:46:59.190
because they're essentially
unstable.

00:46:59.190 --> 00:47:01.190
You can't fly them manually.

00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:05.130
You need a basic computer on
board to spin the props to go

00:47:05.130 --> 00:47:07.030
clockwise, to go
counter-clockwise, and just

00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:08.720
getting the math right.

00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:12.180
It needs to happen at 400 times
a second, 400 Hertz.

00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:14.640
But once you get it right, you
can do all sorts of amazing

00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:16.160
configurations.

00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:17.410
It's just math, right?

00:47:17.410 --> 00:47:23.240
It's just these look-up tables
that can control any shape,

00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:25.880
and how big a camera you want
to lift, whether you want to

00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:32.020
have an open field of view for
a camera, whether you want

00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:33.700
redundancy of motors,
et cetera.

00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:35.230
This is just math.

00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:39.150
And it's really kind of exciting
that you can now come

00:47:39.150 --> 00:47:42.500
up with these extraordinary
and before impossible

00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:45.980
configurations of aircraft and
fly them with an auto-pilot

00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:49.630
that costs just over $100.

00:47:49.630 --> 00:47:50.720
So we ended up with this.

00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:52.980
We started with the
Arduino platform.

00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:56.000
And actually, I have one of
the auto-pilots here.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.250
Here, I'll just grab it here.

00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:02.770
This is an auto-pilot
right here.

00:48:02.770 --> 00:48:04.940
It's just a little box.

00:48:04.940 --> 00:48:07.600
And you put this little
box in any vehicle.

00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:10.540
And it suddenly becomes a fully
autonomous drone, and

00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:12.080
including a car.

00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:15.390
Not quite as good as your
autonomous car, but this one's

00:48:15.390 --> 00:48:17.010
a lot cheaper.

00:48:17.010 --> 00:48:17.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:19.880
CHRIS ANDERSON: You know, you
could put it in anything.

00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:21.250
I don't have a boat up
there, but you can

00:48:21.250 --> 00:48:22.040
do boats, et cetera.

00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:23.270
But this is kind of magical.

00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:26.380
This is basically a triple-core,
Arduino board,

00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:28.450
GPS, lots of sensors,
et cetera.

00:48:28.450 --> 00:48:31.830
You just stick this in any
vehicle, and suddenly it's

00:48:31.830 --> 00:48:35.860
like a military grade UAV, minus
the weapons, of course.

00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:38.210
And then you've got these
ground stations.

00:48:38.210 --> 00:48:39.820
And you just point and
click waypoints.

00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:40.850
And you give mission commands.

00:48:40.850 --> 00:48:41.710
And it's scriptable.

00:48:41.710 --> 00:48:43.560
And you can script it
in Python or just

00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:44.520
manually like this.

00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:46.990
And automatic takeoff, and
landing, and loiter, and

00:48:46.990 --> 00:48:48.000
camera control.

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.860
And we have this cool Follow-me
function where you

00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:52.290
have it in a box that looks
a little like this.

00:48:52.290 --> 00:48:53.850
And let's say you're windsurfing
out there on the

00:48:53.850 --> 00:48:57.100
bay and you're really
doing well.

00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:58.250
And this is the GoPro
era, right?

00:48:58.250 --> 00:49:00.990
You totally need this
on YouTube.

00:49:00.990 --> 00:49:02.170
So what you just do is
you just push the

00:49:02.170 --> 00:49:04.640
button in the box.

00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:07.880
And your quadricopter with the
GoPro takes off from the

00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:11.140
beach, comes out to you,
positions itself 30 feet

00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:13.660
behind and 30 feet above you,
and then just follows you

00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:16.960
around as you do your thing with
the camera focused on you

00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:18.040
the whole time.

00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:19.150
And when the battery
gets low, it flies

00:49:19.150 --> 00:49:21.510
itself back to the beach.

00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:22.690
That's the Follow-me function.

00:49:22.690 --> 00:49:26.990
That's like the droids, you know
the personal droids in

00:49:26.990 --> 00:49:28.240
Star Wars, right?

00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:29.470
This is now possible.

00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:31.660
There are people doing
it right now.

00:49:31.660 --> 00:49:34.690
And this didn't come to
you from Boeing or

00:49:34.690 --> 00:49:35.590
from Lockheed Martin.

00:49:35.590 --> 00:49:38.320
It came to you from a community
of amateurs--

00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:40.440
we all have day jobs but, by
this, we're amateurs--

00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:42.540
working together using the web's
innovation model and

00:49:42.540 --> 00:49:46.050
open platforms like Arduino.

00:49:46.050 --> 00:49:47.940
So what we ended up
doing was being--

00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:49.740
and we ended up part of the
Open Hardware Movement.

00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:51.180
So MakerBot's open hardware.

00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:52.020
And there's a number
of others.

00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:57.590
But we realized that, by
accident, we'd figured out a

00:49:57.590 --> 00:49:59.520
way, along with many others, to

00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:00.940
industrialize the Maker Movement.

00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:03.270
We give away the bits
in the community.

00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:04.730
That software is all open.

00:50:04.730 --> 00:50:08.720
And then we sell the atoms in
the form of hardware with a

00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:10.650
robotic company.

00:50:10.650 --> 00:50:13.490
We don't have the best
technology in the world, but

00:50:13.490 --> 00:50:14.900
we have the cheapest technology
in the world.

00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:16.380
And we have the best innovation

00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:17.740
model, which is open.

00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:21.900
And the ability to apply the
web's innovation model to

00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:25.850
physical goods is the real tool
here, just in the same

00:50:25.850 --> 00:50:29.910
way the technologists created
TCP/IP and HTML, et cetera.

00:50:29.910 --> 00:50:32.570
But we, the regular people,
filled it with our ideas.

00:50:32.570 --> 00:50:34.490
And that's right where
we are with hardware.

00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:37.950
The technology is there
and easy and in place.

00:50:37.950 --> 00:50:40.410
And now we can just fill
it with our ideas.

00:50:40.410 --> 00:50:43.170
And the nice thing about
hardware is that there's no

00:50:43.170 --> 00:50:45.030
crazy debate over the
business model.

00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:46.980
The business model is you
sell products for

00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:48.206
more than they cost.

00:50:48.206 --> 00:50:49.200
Period.

00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:51.710
That's it.

00:50:51.710 --> 00:50:54.040
Business schools professors
keep saying, explain your

00:50:54.040 --> 00:50:54.220
business model.

00:50:54.220 --> 00:50:57.272
It's like, we sell products
for more than they cost.

00:50:57.272 --> 00:50:59.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:00.800
CHRIS ANDERSON: We made
money on Day 1.

00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:04.330
We actually sell it at 2.6
times the actual cost.

00:51:04.330 --> 00:51:07.760
2.6, that cost is the Bill
of Materials plus labor.

00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:09.440
And 2.6 is like this
magic number.

00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:12.130
It's basically two 40% margins,
one for us, and one

00:51:12.130 --> 00:51:15.070
for our distribution partners,
a wholesale and a retail

00:51:15.070 --> 00:51:16.970
margin, if you will, 2.6.

00:51:16.970 --> 00:51:19.310
2.6 times the Bill of Materials
is like an order of

00:51:19.310 --> 00:51:21.480
magnitude cheaper than
closed-source, sometimes two

00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:23.460
orders of magnitude cheaper.

00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:25.070
It's not rocket science.

00:51:25.070 --> 00:51:26.170
We learned it from other
people in the

00:51:26.170 --> 00:51:28.340
Open Hardware Movement.

00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:30.590
But it works great.

00:51:30.590 --> 00:51:32.590
And the customers do the product
development for us.

00:51:32.590 --> 00:51:33.810
They design the products
for us.

00:51:33.810 --> 00:51:34.600
They then give it to us.

00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:36.150
We then sell it back to them.

00:51:36.150 --> 00:51:39.980
If it's not right, they
fix it for us.

00:51:39.980 --> 00:51:41.370
If it needs customer support,
they do the

00:51:41.370 --> 00:51:42.290
customer support for us.

00:51:42.290 --> 00:51:43.540
They write the documentation.

00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:47.230
They catch our bugs.

00:51:47.230 --> 00:51:48.650
They do our regression
testing.

00:51:48.650 --> 00:51:49.936
It's just wonderful.

00:51:49.936 --> 00:51:50.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:52.660
CHRIS ANDERSON: Now, it's also
an incredible obligation and

00:51:52.660 --> 00:51:53.970
responsibility.

00:51:53.970 --> 00:51:56.280
Every morning, I wake up
to lots of customers

00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:57.140
with lots of demands.

00:51:57.140 --> 00:52:00.520
But the point is is that the
web's innovation model works

00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:01.340
in the real world.

00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:04.600
And we've seen what it does in
electronics, but just imagine

00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:07.410
what it can do in
everything else.

00:52:07.410 --> 00:52:08.640
So I just wanted to end
with that story.

00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:10.360
Jordi, I told you about Jordi.

00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:11.990
I showed you a picture
of Jordi Munoz.

00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:14.430
And I just wanted to tell
you what happened.

00:52:14.430 --> 00:52:17.490
So when we started DIY Drones,
it became clear that we needed

00:52:17.490 --> 00:52:20.090
to make a company.

00:52:20.090 --> 00:52:22.650
We put the files out there,
and we said, here.

00:52:22.650 --> 00:52:24.020
Here's the PCB file.

00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:25.160
Just have it batched.

00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:27.400
And then order the components
from DigiKey

00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:28.490
and then solder it.

00:52:28.490 --> 00:52:29.750
Come on.

00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:31.540
And people were like, could you
do that for us, because

00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:33.040
that's actually kind of hard.

00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:34.900
And we said, OK.

00:52:34.900 --> 00:52:36.940
And so we started on the kitchen
table hand soldering.

00:52:36.940 --> 00:52:37.560
And that was no fun.

00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:40.330
And then we sent it to China
and realized that, when you

00:52:40.330 --> 00:52:41.770
have to get economies of scale,
you have to order

00:52:41.770 --> 00:52:44.225
1,000, which means that, if
it's wrong, you just have

00:52:44.225 --> 00:52:45.230
1,000 dead boards.

00:52:45.230 --> 00:52:47.885
And also, if you order 1,000
boards or 10,000 boards, you

00:52:47.885 --> 00:52:50.180
actually have to sell them
before you change the design,

00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:53.040
or else all your money is
sunk in dead boards.

00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:54.760
And so we then brought
it back.

00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:56.120
And we said, well, we'll do
our own manufacturing.

00:52:56.120 --> 00:52:56.990
We'll start a factory.

00:52:56.990 --> 00:52:59.360
And so we started it in
a garage, as one does.

00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:02.150
There's Jordi on the right.

00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:06.240
Oh, by the way, Jordi was the
guy who just was doing the

00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:07.180
cool stuff in the forum.

00:53:07.180 --> 00:53:10.660
He was flying a helicopter
with a Wii controller.

00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:11.900
And he posted YouTube videos.

00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:13.090
And he showed he could do it.

00:53:13.090 --> 00:53:15.750
And so I'm like, that
guy is awesome.

00:53:15.750 --> 00:53:16.750
He knows all the cool stuff.

00:53:16.750 --> 00:53:18.290
He turned me on to Arduino.

00:53:18.290 --> 00:53:20.950
And I said, Jordi, do you want
to start a company together?

00:53:20.950 --> 00:53:21.780
And he said, sure.

00:53:21.780 --> 00:53:23.500
I said, tell me a little
something about yourself.

00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:26.430
And he turned out to be a
19-year-old from Tijuana.

00:53:26.430 --> 00:53:28.530
He just graduated from
high school.

00:53:28.530 --> 00:53:32.630
And today, he's the CEO
of 3D Robotics.

00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:35.270
This is like a tiny corner of
one of our two factories.

00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:39.630
We have one in San Diego
and one in Tijuana.

00:53:39.630 --> 00:53:42.100
We've got something like
24,000 square foot of

00:53:42.100 --> 00:53:42.700
[? pick-and-place ?]

00:53:42.700 --> 00:53:47.810
lines and CNC machines
and 50 workers

00:53:47.810 --> 00:53:48.950
right now and engineers.

00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:52.190
And we put twice as
many drones in the

00:53:52.190 --> 00:53:54.630
air as the US military.

00:53:54.630 --> 00:53:56.890
Our drones cost $600 and are
made out of plastic.

00:53:56.890 --> 00:53:59.410
And theirs cost $6 million and
are not made out of plastic.

00:53:59.410 --> 00:53:59.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:59.740 --> 00:54:00.930
CHRIS ANDERSON: But
still, we've got

00:54:00.930 --> 00:54:02.170
15,000 of them out there.

00:54:02.170 --> 00:54:03.930
And the military has 7,000.

00:54:03.930 --> 00:54:08.130
And Jordi has built this
by basically buying--

00:54:08.130 --> 00:54:09.760
the first [? pick-and-place ?]
we got on eBay.

00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:12.220
And he looked up the
manual on Google.

00:54:12.220 --> 00:54:16.260
And today, we're going for
ISO 9000 compliance.

00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:19.080
And that was three years.

00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:23.170
So that's the answer
to Joy's paradox.

00:54:23.170 --> 00:54:26.220
10 years ago, when the editor of
"Wired" was going to start

00:54:26.220 --> 00:54:29.110
a drone company, what are the
odds that he would end up with

00:54:29.110 --> 00:54:31.180
a Mexican teenager
from Tijuana?

00:54:31.180 --> 00:54:34.950
And yet, that was the best
person in the world for this

00:54:34.950 --> 00:54:36.810
job, that he was the smartest
person in the world.

00:54:36.810 --> 00:54:39.930
He failed all the 20th century
tests of talent acquisition.

00:54:39.930 --> 00:54:42.190
He did not speak the right
language, come from the right

00:54:42.190 --> 00:54:45.660
country, have the right degree
or any degree, have any

00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:47.310
professional experience.

00:54:47.310 --> 00:54:47.900
He would have failed.

00:54:47.900 --> 00:54:50.040
He would not have worked.

00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:54.950
Maybe your admission standards
have changed at Google, but by

00:54:54.950 --> 00:54:57.830
and large, I suspect he would
have failed your tests.

00:54:57.830 --> 00:55:01.610
And yet, he passed the test of
the web's talent discovery

00:55:01.610 --> 00:55:02.990
model, which is that
he could do it.

00:55:02.990 --> 00:55:04.540
And he showed what
he could do.

00:55:07.420 --> 00:55:09.625
Actually, I asked him questions
like, tell me a

00:55:09.625 --> 00:55:10.050
little something
about yourself.

00:55:10.050 --> 00:55:11.680
But it didn't matter any more.

00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:14.110
He'd already proven his
ability to do it.

00:55:14.110 --> 00:55:19.120
And today, it turns out it's
the best in the world.

00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:21.650
I thought I was picking him
because he knew a lot about

00:55:21.650 --> 00:55:23.790
technology, and he was really
innovative, and he turned me

00:55:23.790 --> 00:55:24.550
on to Arduino.

00:55:24.550 --> 00:55:26.310
But in fact, his real
asset was that he

00:55:26.310 --> 00:55:29.090
turned me on to Mexico.

00:55:29.090 --> 00:55:32.690
We have a second plant
in Tijuana.

00:55:32.690 --> 00:55:35.050
You may think of Tijuana as
being cheap tequila and drug

00:55:35.050 --> 00:55:39.270
cartels, but it's the Shenzhen
of North America.

00:55:39.270 --> 00:55:41.860
Every screen here was assembled
in Tijuana.

00:55:41.860 --> 00:55:45.130
The Samsungs and the Sonys have
massive plants there in

00:55:45.130 --> 00:55:47.340
the special economic zone.

00:55:47.340 --> 00:55:49.210
Mexico graduates more engineers
than the United

00:55:49.210 --> 00:55:52.370
States, 55,000 a year.

00:55:52.370 --> 00:55:56.490
We are outside of the export
control zone in Tijuana.

00:55:56.490 --> 00:56:00.650
We have access to ISO 6000,
9000, engineers and operations

00:56:00.650 --> 00:56:04.255
managers who we could never find
or afford in San Diego.

00:56:06.910 --> 00:56:08.580
Now I'm a maquiladora.

00:56:08.580 --> 00:56:11.450
I'm a Mexican, high-tech
entrepreneur.

00:56:11.450 --> 00:56:13.060
How did this happen?

00:56:13.060 --> 00:56:14.680
But the answer is Jordi.

00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:17.310
He taught me everything about
the stuff that really

00:56:17.310 --> 00:56:20.670
mattered, which was how do you
bring manufacturing back to

00:56:20.670 --> 00:56:21.130
North America.

00:56:21.130 --> 00:56:23.070
How do you do high-tech,
but built on the

00:56:23.070 --> 00:56:24.320
web's innovation model?

00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:26.840
How do you compete with the
aerospace industry with a

00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:29.430
bottoms-up, home brew computing
club model?

00:56:29.430 --> 00:56:31.220
It turns out he knew that.

00:56:31.220 --> 00:56:33.040
I didn't know I needed
to know that.

00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:34.280
But he just knew that.

00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:36.730
And because he'd proven himself
in the community, he

00:56:36.730 --> 00:56:38.600
was the right person
to do it with.

00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:41.670
So there's the answer
to Joy's paradox.

00:56:41.670 --> 00:56:43.450
You don't find people, the
right people, on the web.

00:56:43.450 --> 00:56:44.590
They find you.

00:56:44.590 --> 00:56:45.620
You put your idea out there.

00:56:45.620 --> 00:56:47.260
You start something.

00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:48.520
You share your ideas.

00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:50.130
And the smartest people
in the world will find

00:56:50.130 --> 00:56:51.520
you for their reasons.

00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:56.520
And ultimately, they turn out
to be the secret to this new

00:56:56.520 --> 00:56:58.430
industrial model.

00:56:58.430 --> 00:57:03.100
So with that, this is all
described and much more with

00:57:03.100 --> 00:57:06.110
many other examples in the book
that came out last week.

00:57:06.110 --> 00:57:07.290
But thank you, very much.

00:57:07.290 --> 00:57:08.547
I'll take your questions.

00:57:08.547 --> 00:57:12.840
[APPLAUSE]

00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:15.702
CHRIS ANDERSON: Thank you.

00:57:15.702 --> 00:57:18.140
MALE SPEAKER: So two questions,
if I could.

00:57:18.140 --> 00:57:21.980
The first is, when do you see
more advanced materials and

00:57:21.980 --> 00:57:25.050
potentially even molecular
synthesis being a feature of

00:57:25.050 --> 00:57:26.330
3D printers?

00:57:26.330 --> 00:57:29.910
The second is I, a little under
a year ago, saw this

00:57:29.910 --> 00:57:31.530
coming too and bought
some stocks.

00:57:31.530 --> 00:57:33.900
I bought 3D Systems at a pretty
reasonable [? P. ?]

00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:34.995
CHRIS ANDERSON: Good choice.

00:57:34.995 --> 00:57:37.100
MALE SPEAKER: But I think, if
there's other recommendations

00:57:37.100 --> 00:57:39.780
that you have in terms of
companies that are going to be

00:57:39.780 --> 00:57:43.110
paying off because of the trend,
actually, just the

00:57:43.110 --> 00:57:44.850
prototype, and getting more
and more, not only for

00:57:44.850 --> 00:57:48.010
individual makers, but also
probably replacing the lower

00:57:48.010 --> 00:57:49.780
segments of production
manufacturing

00:57:49.780 --> 00:57:50.560
as a whole as well.

00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:51.310
CHRIS ANDERSON: Right.

00:57:51.310 --> 00:57:53.850
OK, the second question first,
in terms of the other

00:57:53.850 --> 00:57:55.410
companies that are
leading this.

00:57:55.410 --> 00:57:57.250
Autodesk is doing tremendously
well.

00:57:57.250 --> 00:58:00.110
They're really pivoting towards
and recognizing that

00:58:00.110 --> 00:58:03.060
design is now a democratized
skill.

00:58:03.060 --> 00:58:05.800
So it's going to end up in
curriculums and making it free

00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:07.620
on Android and DEWA.

00:58:07.620 --> 00:58:09.310
Actually, they're on
IOS at the moment.

00:58:09.310 --> 00:58:10.700
But anyway, Autodesk
is a good choice.

00:58:10.700 --> 00:58:11.860
3D Systems is doing good work.

00:58:11.860 --> 00:58:12.815
MakerBot is not public.

00:58:12.815 --> 00:58:14.280
You can't invest in
it at the moment.

00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:16.260
But they're obviously doing
good work as well.

00:58:18.970 --> 00:58:21.740
We also used Cellworks and
a couple of others.

00:58:21.740 --> 00:58:26.330
But I would say buying Autodesk
is not a bad way to

00:58:26.330 --> 00:58:28.430
expose yourself to this.

00:58:28.430 --> 00:58:30.880
Your second question about the
materials, so right now, you

00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:34.490
can upload your stuff
to services like

00:58:34.490 --> 00:58:36.220
Shapeways or Ponoko.

00:58:36.220 --> 00:58:38.600
You don't need to own
a printer yourself.

00:58:38.600 --> 00:58:42.970
And they can print in a range of
materials, glasses, metals.

00:58:42.970 --> 00:58:47.170
They can do titanium, gold
plated, et cetera.

00:58:47.170 --> 00:58:50.130
On your desktop, I think the
next-- so right now, we're in

00:58:50.130 --> 00:58:52.740
the one-color ABS plastic
and PLA, which is a

00:58:52.740 --> 00:58:54.790
starch-based material.

00:58:54.790 --> 00:58:57.660
You can now buy, pretty easily,
two colors, which you

00:58:57.660 --> 00:59:00.790
can mix on layers, but
not intertwined.

00:59:00.790 --> 00:59:03.210
Soon we'll be able to mix three
colors simultaneously.

00:59:03.210 --> 00:59:08.390
So then you could put images
and shapes and texture or

00:59:08.390 --> 00:59:10.470
color onto the objects.

00:59:10.470 --> 00:59:12.515
So now you can simulate what you
can do with a combination

00:59:12.515 --> 00:59:16.360
of injection molding
and stenciling.

00:59:16.360 --> 00:59:19.260
Other materials are coming in.

00:59:19.260 --> 00:59:21.650
Right now, the first thing
is to bring hard and soft

00:59:21.650 --> 00:59:24.760
materials into the same mix.

00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:28.290
The next thing is to bring
some of these simple

00:59:28.290 --> 00:59:29.220
electronic layers.

00:59:29.220 --> 00:59:31.460
And I say electronic, I really
mean electrical layers, so

00:59:31.460 --> 00:59:34.120
wires, pretty in a
layer of wires.

00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:38.080
It's going to be a little harder
to do multi-layers of

00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:39.180
electronics.

00:59:39.180 --> 00:59:41.580
Like semiconductors, I think,
would be very, very hard.

00:59:41.580 --> 00:59:43.260
But you can start to see that
printed circuit boards are

00:59:43.260 --> 00:59:46.270
going to be something that you
can actually print as well.

00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:49.240
Then you go on.

00:59:49.240 --> 00:59:52.300
Like there, you can start
bringing metals, et cetera.

00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:53.590
Obviously, you're dealing with
thermal properties and

00:59:53.590 --> 00:59:55.010
cooling, et cetera, so
it's non-trivial.

00:59:55.010 --> 00:59:58.720
But the laws of physics don't
stand in your way.

00:59:58.720 --> 01:00:00.510
Then you project way out.

01:00:00.510 --> 01:00:03.520
And you start looking at
things like biology.

01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:06.680
So right now, we can already
print with stem cells and

01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:10.460
create things that are
biologically active.

01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:12.630
You can print a kidney, but not
a working kidney, because

01:00:12.630 --> 01:00:14.290
the vascular system's
not in there.

01:00:14.290 --> 01:00:17.680
But you can kind of see
where this is going.

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:19.460
Maybe you're just printing
the matrix on

01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:20.550
which the cells exist.

01:00:20.550 --> 01:00:23.610
And then you infuse them
with live stem cells.

01:00:23.610 --> 01:00:26.690
Anyway, I don't want to get
too crazy and scary there.

01:00:26.690 --> 01:00:28.630
MALE SPEAKER: What's the
horizon, though, for the more

01:00:28.630 --> 01:00:29.530
advanced materials?

01:00:29.530 --> 01:00:31.480
CHRIS ANDERSON: I would say
that we're looking--

01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:33.950
I would look at full color 3D
printing within five years on

01:00:33.950 --> 01:00:37.640
the desktop and multi-material,
including

01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:40.534
electrical circuitry, within
seven to eight.

01:00:40.534 --> 01:00:41.330
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

01:00:41.330 --> 01:00:43.560
CHRIS ANDERSON: Thank you.

01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:46.970
MALE SPEAKER: What's the status
of getting mechanical

01:00:46.970 --> 01:00:49.190
stuff made up out of
interchangeable parts?

01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:50.910
It seems overly custom.

01:00:50.910 --> 01:00:54.100
I'd like to make a design
and then send it out and

01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:55.930
have it made up.

01:00:55.930 --> 01:00:57.960
Just how that happened, the
same way, circuits are

01:00:57.960 --> 01:00:58.930
happening now.

01:00:58.930 --> 01:01:00.400
CHRIS ANDERSON: So I didn't
quite understand.

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:02.435
You said this was getting
mechanical parts?

01:01:02.435 --> 01:01:03.130
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

01:01:03.130 --> 01:01:05.760
Can I do mechanical CAD
and just have it sent

01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:06.830
out and have it made?

01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:09.640
And it's all known stuff
and it just works and

01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:10.395
it's already solved.

01:01:10.395 --> 01:01:11.040
CHRIS ANDERSON: Yeah.

01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:11.810
Yeah, you can.

01:01:11.810 --> 01:01:15.310
So right now, you can take your
CAD file and upload it to

01:01:15.310 --> 01:01:18.360
Shapeways and being made in
any material you want.

01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:21.025
If you'd rather have it
machined, rather than 3D

01:01:21.025 --> 01:01:24.630
printed, there's other companies
like mfg.com, which

01:01:24.630 --> 01:01:28.320
will basically do
CNC'ing for you.

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:32.220
Typically, you can have a single
file, which has all the

01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:34.890
moving parts printed at the same
time, manufactured at the

01:01:34.890 --> 01:01:39.160
same time, but those things tend
to be a little clunky.

01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:41.620
So gears might want to be made
out of one substance and then

01:01:41.620 --> 01:01:43.500
[? clothes ?] might want to
be made out of another.

01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:44.090
MALE SPEAKER: No.

01:01:44.090 --> 01:01:45.660
But like a service bureau
that makes the whole

01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:47.570
thing for me, say.

01:01:47.570 --> 01:01:49.110
CHRIS ANDERSON: Give me an
example of how complex the

01:01:49.110 --> 01:01:51.355
product is.

01:01:51.355 --> 01:01:54.272
MALE SPEAKER: An RC car.

01:01:54.272 --> 01:01:56.400
CHRIS ANDERSON: OK, that's
really complex.

01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:56.800
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:57.065
No.

01:01:57.065 --> 01:01:58.070
Just skip the radio.

01:01:58.070 --> 01:02:01.980
Just the car part, motors and
gears and wheels and chassis.

01:02:01.980 --> 01:02:04.430
CHRIS ANDERSON: Even that
is relatively--

01:02:04.430 --> 01:02:08.410
you can go to Thingiverse right
now and download all the

01:02:08.410 --> 01:02:10.260
body parts of an RC car.

01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:11.600
So they already have
that right now.

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:15.510
But you have to then buy a bag
which has the motor and the

01:02:15.510 --> 01:02:17.880
radio parts.

01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:19.900
So what you're describing, any
one of those things right

01:02:19.900 --> 01:02:23.490
there is basically about as
complex as you can get.

01:02:23.490 --> 01:02:25.320
You have lots of materials,
some of them are machined,

01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:26.670
some of them are printed,
some of them are

01:02:26.670 --> 01:02:28.240
injection molded, et cetera.

01:02:30.990 --> 01:02:32.890
We haven't gotten to
the replicator yet.

01:02:32.890 --> 01:02:36.600
You can't just say "watch," and
it will print it all out.

01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:38.940
MALE SPEAKER: No, but
basically, I'm

01:02:38.940 --> 01:02:40.010
thinking just a factory.

01:02:40.010 --> 01:02:41.760
And I send them the design.

01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:43.690
And they build it.

01:02:43.690 --> 01:02:44.395
And back it comes.

01:02:44.395 --> 01:02:47.590
CHRIS ANDERSON: So that is
actually something more like

01:02:47.590 --> 01:02:50.000
Alibaba or mfg.com.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:55.166
So take some mechanical
device, a clock work.

01:02:55.166 --> 01:02:58.930
That, you'd probably send it to
mfg.com and get a quote, or

01:02:58.930 --> 01:03:02.530
send to alibaba.com and
get a quote back.

01:03:02.530 --> 01:03:04.820
And what you'd find is that it's
actually probably being

01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:07.080
made with a combination of
manual and automated work--

01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:10.880
largely CNC work, but they've
abstracted so much of it and

01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:12.860
built it on standard materials
and you've uploaded your CAD

01:03:12.860 --> 01:03:14.280
file so you have certainty that
they're going to make

01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:15.250
what you want--

01:03:15.250 --> 01:03:17.170
that it might as well
be automated.

01:03:17.170 --> 01:03:18.840
And literally, two weeks,
three weeks

01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:21.193
later, you've got it.

01:03:21.193 --> 01:03:22.135
Yes, sir?

01:03:22.135 --> 01:03:25.100
MALE SPEAKER: You talked about,
in the publishing

01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:27.390
revolution, people figured
out fonts and kerning

01:03:27.390 --> 01:03:27.920
and all this stuff.

01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:30.170
But I don't think end users
figured that out.

01:03:30.170 --> 01:03:31.800
It was just that the software
got to that point.

01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:32.070
CHRIS ANDERSON: Yes.

01:03:32.070 --> 01:03:32.530
Exactly.

01:03:32.530 --> 01:03:36.226
MALE SPEAKER: And you alluded
to that with the 3D--

01:03:36.226 --> 01:03:38.130
CHRIS ANDERSON: 123 CAD--
the 3D [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:38.130 --> 01:03:40.170
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, the 3D
scanner thing and then some of

01:03:40.170 --> 01:03:40.630
the software.

01:03:40.630 --> 01:03:45.730
But I was wondering what's
remaining for

01:03:45.730 --> 01:03:47.240
it to really become--

01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:50.200
where do you see that analogy
playing out where we all have

01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:52.550
good enough software that prints
posters and prints

01:03:52.550 --> 01:03:54.230
stuff for us, that we don't
think about it.

01:03:54.230 --> 01:03:54.840
CHRIS ANDERSON: That's
a great question.

01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:56.900
It's a really interesting
information problem.

01:03:56.900 --> 01:03:59.540
So right now, what it does is,
right now, the wizards will

01:03:59.540 --> 01:04:02.120
walk you through a relatively
simple process, which is,

01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:04.420
basically, do you want to output
it on a 3D printer?

01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:06.480
Or do you want to output
it in 2D in layers?

01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:08.110
So you start there.

01:04:08.110 --> 01:04:09.740
Then they walk you through
some material choices.

01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:13.730
And this is based on both
structural considerations and

01:04:13.730 --> 01:04:14.730
cost considerations.

01:04:14.730 --> 01:04:18.190
Does he want it to be wood, or
cardboard, or plastic, or

01:04:18.190 --> 01:04:20.780
metal, or glass, or whatever?

01:04:20.780 --> 01:04:23.100
Then they walk you through some
volume-- you can make the

01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:26.730
model a little simpler, remove
some internal surfaces and

01:04:26.730 --> 01:04:28.780
reduce the cost and weight
and things like that.

01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:33.230
So that's kind of where
they're at right now.

01:04:33.230 --> 01:04:36.880
Now, when you go to high-end
CAD, then the CAD program

01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:39.770
itself is able to do things like
complex fluid dynamics

01:04:39.770 --> 01:04:41.820
and finite element analysis.

01:04:41.820 --> 01:04:43.560
And they go through the physics
of the materials

01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:44.340
themselves.

01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:46.480
And they'll start to do
things like, well,

01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:48.210
this wall is too thick.

01:04:48.210 --> 01:04:49.040
It doesn't need to
be that thick.

01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:51.190
And this wall is too thin.

01:04:51.190 --> 01:04:53.850
Here's a flex point which
needs to be bolstered.

01:04:53.850 --> 01:04:56.210
You might want to pick a
different material here, given

01:04:56.210 --> 01:04:58.020
the strength considerations,
weight

01:04:58.020 --> 01:04:59.320
considerations, things like that.

01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:00.380
That's high-end stuff.

01:05:00.380 --> 01:05:04.890
But it's increasingly within
a plug-in on some

01:05:04.890 --> 01:05:05.770
of these free tools.

01:05:05.770 --> 01:05:10.810
You can download CFD or finite
element analysis tools.

01:05:10.810 --> 01:05:12.970
And then you'd move to the next
level, which is, let's

01:05:12.970 --> 01:05:15.310
say you want to injection
mold something.

01:05:15.310 --> 01:05:18.210
So it's very easy to
3D print your part.

01:05:18.210 --> 01:05:19.120
You've got your prototype.

01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:20.970
Then take the inverse
and CNC it.

01:05:20.970 --> 01:05:22.160
Now you've got your mold.

01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:25.200
OK, that's great, except for,
actually flowing plastic into

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:28.230
a mold is not trivial.

01:05:28.230 --> 01:05:29.080
It's easy to put it in.

01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:32.240
But the problem is that
plastic shrinks.

01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:33.720
It basically goes
into one place.

01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:36.400
And you want the shrinkage
to avoid distortion.

01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:40.820
So guys who have been doing this
forever know exactly how

01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:43.910
to design a mold so the plastic
flows perfectly and

01:05:43.910 --> 01:05:48.100
then shrinks at an even rate
and you get high yield.

01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:50.540
Right now, that's basically--

01:05:50.540 --> 01:05:52.690
smart people have been
doing it forever.

01:05:52.690 --> 01:05:54.890
But there's no reason why
it can't be software.

01:05:54.890 --> 01:05:56.290
And I'm sure, if you have
enough money, there is

01:05:56.290 --> 01:05:57.760
software out there that
does it right now.

01:05:57.760 --> 01:05:59.730
But there's still an element
of craftsmanship that's in

01:05:59.730 --> 01:06:00.688
manufacturing.

01:06:00.688 --> 01:06:02.640
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:02.966
FEMALE SPEAKER: Hi.

01:06:02.966 --> 01:06:06.300
I have a question as to how
accessible you think this

01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:08.640
revolution really is, when we're
talking about people who

01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:11.750
might not even have internet
connections, who don't have

01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:15.770
$1,000 or more to buy a
MakerBot, and whether this

01:06:15.770 --> 01:06:18.250
revolution may just exacerbate
the effects

01:06:18.250 --> 01:06:19.585
of the digital divide.

01:06:19.585 --> 01:06:21.360
CHRIS ANDERSON: Well, it's
certainly a lot more

01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:23.400
accessible than it ever
has been before.

01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:25.880
So one of the things that Neil
Gershenfeld at the MIT Media

01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:29.670
Lab, or now, actually, the
Center for Atoms and Bits, did

01:06:29.670 --> 01:06:33.610
with his Fab Labs was
specifically target Africa and

01:06:33.610 --> 01:06:35.500
other places that didn't
have access.

01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:37.720
It's largely because these are
people who really don't--

01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:41.480
we have access to highly
manufactured quality parts,

01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:42.990
because we have Walmarts
and all that.

01:06:42.990 --> 01:06:43.820
They typically don't.

01:06:43.820 --> 01:06:46.920
And so there's a notion of
self-empowerment in that.

01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:49.000
Obviously, you have problems
like the technology is still

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.870
relatively expensive, you need
electricity, internet

01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:52.360
connection is good, et cetera.

01:06:55.270 --> 01:06:58.670
I think, electricity is kind of
a necessary element still.

01:06:58.670 --> 01:07:02.990
But putting that aside,
let's just start with

01:07:02.990 --> 01:07:04.650
the barriers to entry.

01:07:04.650 --> 01:07:06.435
The barrier to entry
used to be you

01:07:06.435 --> 01:07:07.170
needed machining skills.

01:07:07.170 --> 01:07:07.850
You don't need that any more.

01:07:07.850 --> 01:07:09.560
Then the barrier tended to
be you need this machine.

01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:11.790
And now you can either afford
the machine, or you can have

01:07:11.790 --> 01:07:13.220
access to it via a service.

01:07:13.220 --> 01:07:14.650
Then the barrier to
entry was CAD.

01:07:14.650 --> 01:07:17.010
CAD was super hard.

01:07:17.010 --> 01:07:20.360
Check out Tinkercad, which is
a web-based CAD program.

01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:23.190
It looks very toy-like and
game-like on the surface.

01:07:23.190 --> 01:07:24.960
But underneath, actually,
it's run by a

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:26.600
former Google engineer.

01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:27.620
FEMALE SPEAKER: It it free?

01:07:27.620 --> 01:07:27.875
CHRIS ANDERSON: Sorry?

01:07:27.875 --> 01:07:28.460
FEMALE SPEAKER: Is it free?

01:07:28.460 --> 01:07:30.140
CHRIS ANDERSON: Absolutely
free.

01:07:30.140 --> 01:07:30.790
Absolutely.

01:07:30.790 --> 01:07:32.550
That's the point.

01:07:32.550 --> 01:07:33.780
It's the web.

01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:35.120
I wrote a book on
that as well.

01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:38.010
[LAUGHTER]

01:07:38.010 --> 01:07:39.300
CHRIS ANDERSON: But underneath,
it's got a very

01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:45.450
powerful engine, basically a
polygon construction engine.

01:07:47.950 --> 01:07:51.360
A lot of the arcane
language of CAD is

01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:52.980
abstracted away in that.

01:07:52.980 --> 01:07:55.530
And then, finally, Minecraft.

01:07:55.530 --> 01:07:58.470
You don't think of Minecraft as
a CAD program, but it is.

01:07:58.470 --> 01:08:00.440
And so I think the kids
really grab--

01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:02.720
kids really understand 3D
spaces and polygons and

01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:04.870
navigating these screen
environments.

01:08:04.870 --> 01:08:07.930
And if you can navigate
Minecraft, you can basically

01:08:07.930 --> 01:08:09.840
navigate a CAD environment.

01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:13.540
And LEGO Digital Designer is
a good example of that.

01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:15.820
One of the nice things about
LEGO is that is a smart

01:08:15.820 --> 01:08:18.580
material in that the pieces know
how they fit together.

01:08:18.580 --> 01:08:20.600
You can't put them
together wrong.

01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:22.910
They snap into alignment.

01:08:22.910 --> 01:08:27.200
And what LEGO Digital Designer
is, is CAD for LEGO.

01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:30.490
But it allows you to create
relatively complex objects.

01:08:30.490 --> 01:08:31.700
And kids are great at that.

01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:33.790
So I think that a lot of the
intellectual barriers to entry

01:08:33.790 --> 01:08:34.729
are falling.

01:08:34.729 --> 01:08:36.130
I mean, obviously, you still
need a little money.

01:08:36.130 --> 01:08:37.770
And you need electricity,
et cetera.

01:08:37.770 --> 01:08:41.180
But the point is you can take
any computer lab today, add

01:08:41.180 --> 01:08:43.729
two 3D printers, and now
it's a design lab.

01:08:43.729 --> 01:08:45.540
And we have computer labs.

01:08:45.540 --> 01:08:47.069
And we have art classes.

01:08:47.069 --> 01:08:48.960
And the two don't
meet each other.

01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:51.310
And yet, you put two to three
3D printers in the computer

01:08:51.310 --> 01:08:54.399
lab, and now you've got that
synthesis of the two.

01:08:54.399 --> 01:08:59.500
And you're not just making a
finger painting to bring home.

01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:02.660
You're actually taking your
ideas and making them real and

01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:05.010
learning skills that are
basically 21st century

01:09:05.010 --> 01:09:05.670
competencies.

01:09:05.670 --> 01:09:09.460
So I think that that's the real
exciting thing here is

01:09:09.460 --> 01:09:13.490
that this is now, if it's easy
enough for kids to use, it's

01:09:13.490 --> 01:09:14.840
easy enough for everybody
to use.

01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:17.229
And fundamentally, growing up
knowing that you can make your

01:09:17.229 --> 01:09:20.370
ideas real is going to create
the generation of innovators

01:09:20.370 --> 01:09:22.310
that are going to drive the next
Industrial Revolution.

01:09:22.310 --> 01:09:23.100
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:24.819
Really quick follow-up
question.

01:09:24.819 --> 01:09:27.250
You alluded to your children
earlier on.

01:09:27.250 --> 01:09:29.330
What was actually their
level of involvement?

01:09:29.330 --> 01:09:33.620
I assume that they weren't the
ones drawing CAD diagrams or

01:09:33.620 --> 01:09:34.994
anything like that.

01:09:34.994 --> 01:09:39.560
CHRIS ANDERSON: So it's
a bit of a sore point.

01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:44.100
Their level of involvement is
always they're very happy to

01:09:44.100 --> 01:09:46.460
try something once with me.

01:09:46.460 --> 01:09:50.399
But if it's hard, they lose
interest pretty quickly.

01:09:50.399 --> 01:09:53.210
They love LEGO Digital Designer,
because they just

01:09:53.210 --> 01:09:54.000
want play on screens.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:55.460
And it's one thing we'll
let them do.

01:09:55.460 --> 01:09:58.130
We won't let them play video
games all the time.

01:09:58.130 --> 01:10:00.830
They tend not to
use CAD a lot.

01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:02.560
Instead, what they do is they
download files from

01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:03.943
Thingiverse and then
just modify them.

01:10:03.943 --> 01:10:04.790
FEMALE SPEAKER: OK.

01:10:04.790 --> 01:10:07.820
CHRIS ANDERSON: But given a
choice between anything on a

01:10:07.820 --> 01:10:10.730
screen and not on a screen,
they'll do anything on a

01:10:10.730 --> 01:10:11.370
screen if we'd let them.

01:10:11.370 --> 01:10:13.340
So we call this educational.

01:10:13.340 --> 01:10:15.080
And they'll do it.

01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:15.800
FEMALE SPEAKER: OK.

01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:16.520
Thanks.

01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:17.660
MALE SPEAKER: Thanks a lot.

01:10:17.660 --> 01:10:18.970
This was really, really
informative.

01:10:18.970 --> 01:10:20.870
A couple of points, I guess.

01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:23.070
One was an open question, which
is that, previously,

01:10:23.070 --> 01:10:26.440
when you wanted to control
dangerous objects or drones

01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:29.190
and so on, you had export
control norms and so on.

01:10:29.190 --> 01:10:30.650
And now you're ending up in a
world where you've got to

01:10:30.650 --> 01:10:34.510
control sale of machines that
could do anything from produce

01:10:34.510 --> 01:10:37.140
really helpful houses to drones,
which could be loaded

01:10:37.140 --> 01:10:37.840
with explosives.

01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:40.970
And there's a big risk to how
do you moderate and control

01:10:40.970 --> 01:10:43.100
this, at the same time,
keep the open model?

01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:44.615
So one is what's your
thoughts on that?

01:10:44.615 --> 01:10:46.600
CHRIS ANDERSON: So as you might
imagine, I get this

01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:47.180
question a lot.

01:10:47.180 --> 01:10:48.370
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, I'm sure.

01:10:48.370 --> 01:10:49.630
CHRIS ANDERSON: Open sourcing
drones, what

01:10:49.630 --> 01:10:52.120
could possibly go wrong?

01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:54.780
So the simple answer is that--
of course, this is true for

01:10:54.780 --> 01:10:55.730
any technology.

01:10:55.730 --> 01:10:59.080
You can misuse computers
as well.

01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:01.750
We feel that we have an
obligation to do two things.

01:11:01.750 --> 01:11:04.240
One is to promote best
practice, to promote

01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:06.390
responsible use.

01:11:06.390 --> 01:11:10.790
For example, you're not allowed
to fly drones in the

01:11:10.790 --> 01:11:13.150
US National airspace for
commercial purposes.

01:11:13.150 --> 01:11:15.300
But you can fly it
recreationally, as long as you

01:11:15.300 --> 01:11:19.040
stay below 400 feet and within
visual line of sight, so that

01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:21.370
you can provide that [? sense ?]
and be able to

01:11:21.370 --> 01:11:22.620
stay out of the way of
[? mandated ?] aviation.

01:11:27.890 --> 01:11:30.150
We know our technology can
fly beyond line of sight.

01:11:30.150 --> 01:11:32.120
We know it can fly
above 400 feet.

01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:34.650
We are hard core about
discouraging that.

01:11:34.650 --> 01:11:37.750
Anybody posts a video doing
that, we come down on them.

01:11:37.750 --> 01:11:42.130
We just bang on all the time
about safety and responsible

01:11:42.130 --> 01:11:44.390
use and about the
FAA guidelines.

01:11:44.390 --> 01:11:45.030
So that's one thing.

01:11:45.030 --> 01:11:50.420
The second thing is that we
don't feel we're competent to

01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:52.020
regulate or police this.

01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:55.370
We think it's our obligation to
inform the regulators and

01:11:55.370 --> 01:11:56.710
law enforcement agencies
about what's

01:11:56.710 --> 01:11:58.270
possible and what's happening.

01:11:58.270 --> 01:12:01.420
So what we do is we reach out to
the agencies out there and

01:12:01.420 --> 01:12:02.330
we invite them in.

01:12:02.330 --> 01:12:04.040
We tell our community
we invite them in.

01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:06.200
I get a quarterly check
up with the FBI.

01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:07.160
We're like, hey,
how's it going?

01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:09.190
Everything's going fine.

01:12:09.190 --> 01:12:12.960
And we say, if anybody starts
talking about something

01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:18.450
dangerous, we will ping our
friends in the FBI ASAP.

01:12:18.450 --> 01:12:21.780
If the FBI sees something that's
dangerous, we will--

01:12:21.780 --> 01:12:22.950
and we disclose this.

01:12:22.950 --> 01:12:23.840
We actually don't have
any information.

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:24.770
All we have is their
email address.

01:12:24.770 --> 01:12:27.790
But we will disclose
the email address.

01:12:27.790 --> 01:12:30.380
And I fly to Washington every
now and then to tell everybody

01:12:30.380 --> 01:12:33.430
what's possible, so that the
people who we've entrusted to

01:12:33.430 --> 01:12:36.170
protect us are informed
about what's possible.

01:12:36.170 --> 01:12:39.490
And we're really transparent
about this with the community.

01:12:39.490 --> 01:12:41.480
If somebody messes this up,
if somebody does something

01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:43.060
dangerous, this is going to
be bad for everybody.

01:12:43.060 --> 01:12:43.930
MALE SPEAKER: Yep.

01:12:43.930 --> 01:12:47.510
CHRIS ANDERSON: And we're just
like, do it, do it in public.

01:12:51.010 --> 01:12:52.760
We as a community have a
responsibility, if we see

01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:55.330
something that we think is
dangerous or irresponsible, to

01:12:55.330 --> 01:12:56.710
tell people about it.

01:12:56.710 --> 01:12:58.910
But we don't feel that we can be
the ones who ultimately are

01:12:58.910 --> 01:12:59.580
the police.

01:12:59.580 --> 01:13:01.650
We're not going to restrict
the technology we release.

01:13:01.650 --> 01:13:06.220
We're just going to inform the
responsible parties about

01:13:06.220 --> 01:13:07.890
what's being released and about
what's been done so that

01:13:07.890 --> 01:13:09.460
they can do the job.

01:13:09.460 --> 01:13:11.280
MALE SPEAKER: The other
follow-up questions that are

01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:14.390
related, but not connected, is
that, as you think about spare

01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:16.090
parts as the entire change
that's going to happen over

01:13:16.090 --> 01:13:21.150
the next 5, 10 or 15 years
of how production and

01:13:21.150 --> 01:13:26.000
mass-customization is going to
happen, where do you see

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.470
people evolving in
their skill sets?

01:13:27.470 --> 01:13:30.070
Because I think, for people who
grew up with CAD software,

01:13:30.070 --> 01:13:30.960
or if they're engineers,
it's easy.

01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:34.460
But for the rest of them,
they're away from that realm

01:13:34.460 --> 01:13:34.885
of learning.

01:13:34.885 --> 01:13:35.550
CHRIS ANDERSON: Yeah.

01:13:35.550 --> 01:13:37.680
Well, I think, in the same way
that you don't think that

01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:40.840
you're publishing when you
post to Facebook, I don't

01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:45.380
think you're going to think
you're doing CAD when you do

01:13:45.380 --> 01:13:48.930
reality capture of some object
and then make it cooler.

01:13:48.930 --> 01:13:53.280
I think that, basically, the
opportunity is to abstract the

01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:55.670
complexity and the professional
standards out of

01:13:55.670 --> 01:13:58.410
this and just come up with a
new design interface, a new

01:13:58.410 --> 01:14:00.350
design language that
allows people to

01:14:00.350 --> 01:14:01.850
express themselves naturally.

01:14:01.850 --> 01:14:03.490
MALE SPEAKER: And this is
for everyone else here.

01:14:03.490 --> 01:14:05.790
As Googlers, there is the
Garage, which is our shared

01:14:05.790 --> 01:14:07.860
working space, which also has
access to a 3D printer.

01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:09.360
Which I found out about
today, morning.

01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:09.900
CHRIS ANDERSON: Excellent.

01:14:09.900 --> 01:14:11.270
Thank you.

01:14:11.270 --> 01:14:12.890
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you
for coming to speak.

01:14:12.890 --> 01:14:15.060
You just talked about the
Open Hardware Movement.

01:14:15.060 --> 01:14:16.620
And you mentioned
MakerBot a lot.

01:14:16.620 --> 01:14:19.440
And I'm sure you're aware that
they seem to have backpedalled

01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:21.780
slightly on the Open
Hardware Movement.

01:14:21.780 --> 01:14:27.720
And also some concern over the
language in Thingiverse's

01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:30.080
agreements, to what you're
giving to them when you upload

01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:30.960
your models.

01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:33.300
Is that paranoia on the
community's part that

01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:34.240
something's happening there?

01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:35.120
Or is there something afoot?

01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:36.760
And what does that mean for
the future of the Open

01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:37.690
Hardware Movement?

01:14:37.690 --> 01:14:38.480
CHRIS ANDERSON: Great
question.

01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:39.620
Thank you, for raising that.

01:14:39.620 --> 01:14:42.680
The answer is a little
bit of both.

01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:45.410
So just the facts, for those
of you who aren't

01:14:45.410 --> 01:14:46.480
familiar with this.

01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:49.850
MakerBot is built on the RepRap
platform, which is an

01:14:49.850 --> 01:14:53.930
open-source hardware and
software platform.

01:14:53.930 --> 01:14:57.840
MakerBot was 100% open and, in
this latest version, had the

01:14:57.840 --> 01:14:59.090
Replicator 2.

01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:03.020
Just to put the facts on the
table, the biggest problem is

01:15:03.020 --> 01:15:04.870
not that they've closed it.

01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:06.560
The biggest problem is they
didn't say what they were

01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:07.830
doing on Day One.

01:15:07.830 --> 01:15:08.840
And so there was
some ambiguity.

01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:11.210
And people suspected
the worst.

01:15:11.210 --> 01:15:12.740
What they are actually doing--

01:15:12.740 --> 01:15:13.990
oh, and by the way, the
Thingiverse thing was a

01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:14.870
complete misunderstanding.

01:15:14.870 --> 01:15:17.120
Those Terms of Service were in
place for a year already.

01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:19.970
And that was just paranoia.

01:15:19.970 --> 01:15:23.760
But here's what's actually
happening is that they've

01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:27.700
looked at the product and they
said, what about this is

01:15:27.700 --> 01:15:31.200
usefully open, which is
to say, we get open.

01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:32.850
We understand that, if you give
something back, you get

01:15:32.850 --> 01:15:35.970
more in return and that you
create a platform for which

01:15:35.970 --> 01:15:36.730
innovation can happen.

01:15:36.730 --> 01:15:39.200
But there's certain elements
that are just not really

01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:41.040
practical for people.

01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:43.955
So for example, their enclosure,
which is powder

01:15:43.955 --> 01:15:47.360
coated steel, you need access
to machinery that regular

01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:48.640
people don't have to do that.

01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:50.290
And they didn't feel that that
was really adding a lot of

01:15:50.290 --> 01:15:51.510
value was the enclosure.

01:15:51.510 --> 01:15:54.160
Whereas, the circuit boards,
the electronics

01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:55.530
themselves, are open.

01:15:55.530 --> 01:15:57.450
They're actually the same ones
that were in the previous one.

01:15:57.450 --> 01:16:01.000
Their software, their underlying
slicing engine,

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:02.920
which does their
Gcode, is open.

01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:07.970
Their UI is not, on the grounds
that they want to have

01:16:07.970 --> 01:16:08.790
some protection.

01:16:08.790 --> 01:16:10.450
But they felt that the
underlying slicing engine was

01:16:10.450 --> 01:16:13.230
the most useful one
to release.

01:16:13.230 --> 01:16:15.560
So the big problem was they
didn't say that on Day One.

01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:17.310
And so people freaked out.

01:16:19.970 --> 01:16:22.610
So where they ended up is what
we call a hybrid model, which

01:16:22.610 --> 01:16:25.580
is you open what you think is
most useful and really serves

01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:26.290
the community best.

01:16:26.290 --> 01:16:31.310
And you close just enough to
give yourself a competitive

01:16:31.310 --> 01:16:33.620
advantage, so that you can build
a sustainable business.

01:16:33.620 --> 01:16:36.300
And I think they got it right.

01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:37.740
I'm not going to say they
got it 100% right.

01:16:37.740 --> 01:16:39.380
But I think that a hybrid
model is probably the

01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:39.830
right way to go.

01:16:39.830 --> 01:16:43.620
So for example, on our drones,
our hardware is 100% open.

01:16:43.620 --> 01:16:44.880
We release the [INAUDIBLE]
files.

01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:48.710
Our software is 100%
open, GPL'd.

01:16:48.710 --> 01:16:51.080
When we had laser cut stuff,
we released all those

01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:51.870
as laser cut files.

01:16:51.870 --> 01:16:54.910
We now have injection molded
arms when the designs are in

01:16:54.910 --> 01:16:55.940
SolidWorks.

01:16:55.940 --> 01:16:57.550
And we actually release the
dimensional drawings.

01:16:57.550 --> 01:17:00.980
But we don't release the
SolidWorks files, because

01:17:00.980 --> 01:17:02.730
you'd need an injection
molding machine and

01:17:02.730 --> 01:17:04.940
SolidWorks, which costs
$5,000, to use this.

01:17:04.940 --> 01:17:07.420
And we didn't feel that that
was adding a huge amount of

01:17:07.420 --> 01:17:09.320
value, when we also
are constantly

01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:12.260
ripped off by the Chinese.

01:17:12.260 --> 01:17:14.475
Our license allows you
to use our stuff and

01:17:14.475 --> 01:17:14.960
compete against us.

01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:18.900
But it doesn't allow you to
violate our trademark and not

01:17:18.900 --> 01:17:21.620
adhere to the terms
of the license.

01:17:21.620 --> 01:17:24.490
So we're like, you know what,
these injection molder arms

01:17:24.490 --> 01:17:25.470
are just going to make
it easier for the

01:17:25.470 --> 01:17:26.560
cloners to rip us off.

01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:28.110
And they're not adding a lot
of value to the community.

01:17:28.110 --> 01:17:30.250
So that's where we drew
the line right there.

01:17:30.250 --> 01:17:32.790
Now I'm sure there's someone
out there who thinks we're

01:17:32.790 --> 01:17:35.400
betraying the cause and
we've violated the

01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:36.490
ethic of open hardware.

01:17:36.490 --> 01:17:40.450
But we feel that we made a
reasonable decision to build a

01:17:40.450 --> 01:17:42.740
sustainable business.

01:17:42.740 --> 01:17:45.540
And the truth is, actually,
nobody has complained.

01:17:45.540 --> 01:17:47.193
Maybe they will now that
I've mentioned it.

01:17:47.193 --> 01:17:47.576
[LAUGHTER]

01:17:47.576 --> 01:17:48.370
CHRIS ANDERSON: But
so far, so good.

01:17:48.370 --> 01:17:50.410
So I think that we're all
kind of navigating--

01:17:50.410 --> 01:17:51.310
so I talk to [? Bria ?]

01:17:51.310 --> 01:17:51.780
from [? Maker ?]

01:17:51.780 --> 01:17:52.310
a lot about it.

01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:56.670
So we're all finding our way
towards being mostly--

01:17:56.670 --> 01:17:58.860
Raspberry Pi, for example,
is not open hardware.

01:17:58.860 --> 01:18:00.230
They're open software.

01:18:00.230 --> 01:18:02.850
And I think we had a good post
on Wired Design the other day

01:18:02.850 --> 01:18:05.585
where a designer said, you've
got to sell out a little to

01:18:05.585 --> 01:18:06.410
sell a lot.

01:18:06.410 --> 01:18:08.920
Now that's not exactly the way
I would have phrased it.

01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:15.590
But the point is is that we
didn't join a priesthood here.

01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:18.220
We believe in open source
because it works.

01:18:18.220 --> 01:18:18.830
We've done it.

01:18:18.830 --> 01:18:20.460
We've got years of experience
in this.

01:18:20.460 --> 01:18:22.360
We do it because it's a
practical way to build

01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:23.180
innovation communities.

01:18:23.180 --> 01:18:26.680
But we're not going to be
doctrinaire about it.

01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:29.020
We're going to get the balance
right, so that we can serve

01:18:29.020 --> 01:18:32.500
both our community and our
customers and, to be frank,

01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:34.400
our investors, because
these are big

01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:36.880
businesses now, at best.

01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:40.140
And that involves being flexible
and evolving the

01:18:40.140 --> 01:18:41.040
model as you go.

01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:41.610
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

01:18:41.610 --> 01:18:42.398
Thank you.

01:18:42.398 --> 01:18:43.892
CHRIS ANDERSON: Thank you.

01:18:43.892 --> 01:18:46.390
MALE SPEAKER: There's been
some rumblings about 3D

01:18:46.390 --> 01:18:48.380
printing on a much larger scale,
like people printing

01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:49.380
the walls to houses.

01:18:49.380 --> 01:18:49.850
CHRIS ANDERSON: Yeah.

01:18:49.850 --> 01:18:51.340
MALE SPEAKER: What do you think
is the timeline for that

01:18:51.340 --> 01:18:52.810
becoming more mainstream.

01:18:52.810 --> 01:18:54.710
And when can I print
out an apartment?

01:18:54.710 --> 01:18:55.280
CHRIS ANDERSON: Good question.

01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:56.720
So that is already possible.

01:18:56.720 --> 01:18:58.330
There's already some demos.

01:18:58.330 --> 01:19:00.680
I'm using poured concrete
and basically big heads.

01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:02.840
Now there's one really
interesting demo.

01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:06.800
One of the problems with the
house scale 3D printers which

01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:08.880
pours it, you actually have to
build a 3D printer as big as a

01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:11.610
house, or slightly
bigger, actually.

01:19:11.610 --> 01:19:14.740
There's some really cool
demos involving

01:19:14.740 --> 01:19:17.430
stringing wires from trees.

01:19:17.430 --> 01:19:20.740
You basically just need three
points like a hammock, minus

01:19:20.740 --> 01:19:21.680
one point, [LAUGHS]

01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:22.800
I guess.

01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:24.640
So you just string
wires from trees,

01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:25.990
cables of various sorts.

01:19:25.990 --> 01:19:28.690
And then you just
calibrate it.

01:19:28.690 --> 01:19:30.930
And then you let the head
move on these wires.

01:19:30.930 --> 01:19:32.650
And they have a three
dimensional axis.

01:19:32.650 --> 01:19:36.760
And you've basically created an
in situ, ad hoc, one off 3D

01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:38.420
printer for houses.

01:19:38.420 --> 01:19:41.430
Now this is definitely
experimental lab stuff.

01:19:41.430 --> 01:19:45.190
I wouldn't guarantee the
resolution of a 3D printer

01:19:45.190 --> 01:19:47.950
locked to a tree, which can
slightly bend a little bit.

01:19:47.950 --> 01:19:49.840
But you can kind of see
where this is going.

01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:52.760
And originally they were doing
it as an experiment in

01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:56.170
building, in making concrete
shapes that would be too hard

01:19:56.170 --> 01:19:59.895
to make through traditional
casting or pouring techniques.

01:19:59.895 --> 01:20:03.240
So this is kind of an
art thing right now.

01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:04.830
And don't forget, you also have
to put in things like

01:20:04.830 --> 01:20:06.520
rebar, et cetera.

01:20:06.520 --> 01:20:07.770
So there is that.

01:20:12.390 --> 01:20:13.770
I can't give you a timeline.

01:20:13.770 --> 01:20:15.790
I've seen it work in Italy.

01:20:15.790 --> 01:20:19.240
I don't know how commercial it
is at the moment, but I think

01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:22.810
we're talking a matter of
single digit years.

01:20:22.810 --> 01:20:23.656
MALE SPEAKER: Awesome.

01:20:23.656 --> 01:20:24.230
Thank you.

01:20:24.230 --> 01:20:25.954
CHRIS ANDERSON: Thank you.

01:20:25.954 --> 01:20:27.250
MALE SPEAKER: Hi, Chris.

01:20:27.250 --> 01:20:29.500
So how do you think this
revolution, the new Industrial

01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:31.670
Revolution, applies to also
to food products?

01:20:31.670 --> 01:20:33.950
We have these open source
communities that's creating

01:20:33.950 --> 01:20:34.880
recipes all the time.

01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:37.180
But every single person has to
know how to cook and have the

01:20:37.180 --> 01:20:38.320
utensils, right?

01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:41.360
So you have the spices and all
of the ingredients that make

01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:42.790
food taste a certain way.

01:20:42.790 --> 01:20:44.633
They can be printed
as well, right?

01:20:44.633 --> 01:20:44.860
CHRIS ANDERSON: Sure.

01:20:44.860 --> 01:20:46.640
MALE SPEAKER: So what
do you think?

01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:47.620
CHRIS ANDERSON: Yeah.

01:20:47.620 --> 01:20:49.360
So that's the Star
Trek replicator.

01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:52.100
You know that tea, Earl Grey,
hot, that Captain

01:20:52.100 --> 01:20:54.180
Picard asked for.

01:20:54.180 --> 01:20:55.060
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

01:20:55.060 --> 01:20:57.980
Japan has all these machines
where you can just decide the

01:20:57.980 --> 01:20:59.250
flavors of stuff.

01:20:59.250 --> 01:20:59.420
CHRIS ANDERSON: Yeah.

01:20:59.420 --> 01:21:01.435
MALE SPEAKER: And it prints
out your food.

01:21:01.435 --> 01:21:03.730
CHRIS ANDERSON: Well, you know,
we're already there in a

01:21:03.730 --> 01:21:04.530
trivial sense.

01:21:04.530 --> 01:21:07.220
The reason the first MakerBot
was called a cupcake is that

01:21:07.220 --> 01:21:10.720
it actually could print icing
on a cupcake, because icing

01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:14.650
tends to be like a fluid, that's
going to be a viscous

01:21:14.650 --> 01:21:16.140
fluid that actually works
really well in

01:21:16.140 --> 01:21:18.150
that particular extruder.

01:21:18.150 --> 01:21:18.500
Or sort of.

01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:20.110
Well, I actually never
got it working.

01:21:20.110 --> 01:21:21.960
But chocolate is a nightmare,
by the way.

01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:22.610
Oh, my god.

01:21:22.610 --> 01:21:25.160
I had horrible experiences
trying to temper chocolate, so

01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:27.460
it would go through
the 3D printer.

01:21:27.460 --> 01:21:27.890
[LAUGHTER]

01:21:27.890 --> 01:21:34.000
CHRIS ANDERSON: Anyway, so
again, there's a trivial

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:35.840
answer to this, which is, if
you've got something that

01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:40.360
looks like a goo, any food that
looks like goo, you can

01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:42.870
put it in a 3D printer.

01:21:42.870 --> 01:21:44.060
Do you want to eat that?

01:21:44.060 --> 01:21:47.160
I'm not sure.

01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:50.320
The more complicated question
is, are you going to be able

01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:54.700
to mix ingredients at the right
temperature, in the

01:21:54.700 --> 01:21:57.890
right consistency, at the right
time, in a way that's

01:21:57.890 --> 01:21:59.630
better than what you
can do by hand?

01:21:59.630 --> 01:22:05.260
And obviously, if you go
into a cake factory--

01:22:05.260 --> 01:22:07.410
if you go to a cake factory,
it's really amazing.

01:22:07.410 --> 01:22:09.140
They're a mass of
CNC machines.

01:22:09.140 --> 01:22:11.780
Basically, it's all automated.

01:22:11.780 --> 01:22:15.280
Every cake could be decorated
uniquely with a [INAUDIBLE]

01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:16.600
robot arm.

01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:18.880
It's a beautiful
thing to watch.

01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:20.630
I wouldn't call it a 3D printer,
but it's a complete

01:22:20.630 --> 01:22:23.170
robot cake factory.

01:22:23.170 --> 01:22:23.810
And they do mix it.

01:22:23.810 --> 01:22:26.480
But that's a custom factory
with ingredients that are

01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:28.730
really optimized
for that role.

01:22:28.730 --> 01:22:31.890
You can't do it on
your desktop yet.

01:22:31.890 --> 01:22:32.700
It's a good question.

01:22:32.700 --> 01:22:35.090
What would be the first food
that you would actually-- like

01:22:35.090 --> 01:22:37.740
a microwave oven that, rather
than putting the food the oven

01:22:37.740 --> 01:22:40.660
and pressing the number, you
put a plate in the oven and

01:22:40.660 --> 01:22:41.120
press the number.

01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:43.530
And the food is generated
on it.

01:22:43.530 --> 01:22:46.252
I don't know what that first
food's going to be.

01:22:46.252 --> 01:22:47.470
MALE SPEAKER: Say, for
example, pastas.

01:22:47.470 --> 01:22:51.960
You have all these sauces,
different types of--

01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:55.030
I was just thinking about things
that are bulk already.

01:22:55.030 --> 01:22:58.782
And you just mix different
ingredients.

01:22:58.782 --> 01:23:00.110
CHRIS ANDERSON: Does somebody
in here know

01:23:00.110 --> 01:23:00.720
anything about food?

01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:01.855
[LAUGHTER]

01:23:01.855 --> 01:23:03.695
CHRIS ANDERSON: Anyone want
to hazard a guess on that?

01:23:03.695 --> 01:23:05.521
FEMALE SPEAKER: Here at Google,
we have our Google

01:23:05.521 --> 01:23:05.769
[? supplies ?]

01:23:05.769 --> 01:23:06.018
[? list. ?]

01:23:06.018 --> 01:23:06.390
CHRIS ANDERSON: Yes.

01:23:06.390 --> 01:23:07.510
That's right.

01:23:07.510 --> 01:23:09.025
You have a robotic
food machine.

01:23:09.025 --> 01:23:09.915
[LAUGHTER]

01:23:09.915 --> 01:23:11.960
CHRIS ANDERSON: Yeah.

01:23:11.960 --> 01:23:14.140
I wish I knew more about food.

01:23:14.140 --> 01:23:17.630
My sense is that part of
food preparation is the

01:23:17.630 --> 01:23:18.760
pleasure in doing it.

01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:21.595
And so having a robot do it is
probably not so much fun.

01:23:21.595 --> 01:23:24.920
But anyway, I wish I had a
better answer for you.

01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:26.160
Any other questions?

01:23:26.160 --> 01:23:26.510
All right.

01:23:26.510 --> 01:23:27.440
Thank you, very much.

01:23:27.440 --> 01:23:32.173
[APPLAUSE]
