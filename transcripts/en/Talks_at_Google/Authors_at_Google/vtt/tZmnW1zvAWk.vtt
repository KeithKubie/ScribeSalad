00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.780
GERMAIN: How many people in here have had
an idea for business that they think could

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:22.370
work? Hands up. Okay. That's pretty good.
And how many people tried to make that idea

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:27.839
happen? A few hands, two hands. And how many
people made that idea work and it's a roaring

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:33.320
success now? Two people. That's great. I think
later we'll have great ideas of businesses.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:39.510
I think most of them happen on Friday nights
about 9:00 P.M. in pubs with your mates and

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.330
you go, we got to do this thing one day, you
know, maybe. And people talk a good game,

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:50.809
but rarely get down, to actually start things,
you know, make the idea happen. And I guess

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.750
that's where Innocent got to--Rich, Adam,
and John are the three founders of Innocent.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.070
I went to university with them. We managed
this since we were 18. And they were always

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.460
the people at the university who were going
to do something, you know, they're always

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.179
doing stuff, you know, basically, in terms
of being quite entrepreneurial in trying to,

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:14.870
you know, make a quick buck. And I definitely
wasn't really happy, just not being entrepreneurial.

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:25.620
And obviously, I have changed now in an incredibly
dynamic character. And it's interesting knowing

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.819
them back then, knowing them at about 18 or
so. And about the time we got to about 24,

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:34.140
when we left university and done a few other
things, they'd been talking about it for so

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.580
long that we should start a business. What
should we do? I don't know, but we should

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.979
just have a business. It would be great, wouldn't
it? Wait a minute, why should we have a business?

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.770
Yeah, I said the business, what should it
be? I don't know. They didn't, you know, they

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.759
didn't really know what they were going to
do, but you knew that they were going to do

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:53.229
something and they just have to get to an
idea, an idea that would work and act on it.

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:59.550
And Smoothie was, fortunately, for us, the
idea that works in the beginning and still

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.880
works today. Interestingly, the idea--some
of the ideas didn't work. This is one of the

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.259
ideas that didn't work. This is the--can anyone
tell me what that is? Easy, bath, but even

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:16.480
more--even more specifically? A death trap,
good, is the electric bath, the not-patented

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.159
electric bath. The patent is going if anyone
wants it. I think there's a company in Japan

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:26.620
called Auto Bath where they actually make
something in this realm. But the idea, the

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.140
idea behind it was great. And again, it was
really, like, 9:00 P.M. Friday night, pop

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:38.370
up idea, which is... I hate to run baths.
It's pretty boring. What do you do while you're

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.910
waiting? You know, just hanging around especially
with, you know, specifically British plumbing.

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.890
You know, if you ever lived in a flat where
the water comes out, you know, when it takes

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:53.049
20 minutes to run a bath, that is a real pain
in the bum. So, how can we make this? How

00:02:53.049 --> 00:03:08.159
can we make people's bath experience a better
place? And the only idea was that you could

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:22.600
kind of automate it. So, getting up in the
morning, let's say 7:15 A.M. and knowing that

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.849
your bath has already run to the right depth,
has the correct temperature, has the right

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:29.420
amount of bubble bath in it, is an amazingly
rewarding experience if only I could have

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:30.420
that experience. Well, I can't because I don't
have the electric bath. But maybe one day

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.099
you can use your electric bath because we're
going to design it and make it and that are--how

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:34.049
many hotel rooms are in the U.K.? Thousands.
We're going to get the electric bath with

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.379
every one of those. And how many new built
homes were there being built at the end of

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:39.209
the night? There's thousands, maybe tens of
thousands. We're going to get the electric

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.209
bath into every new home built by [INDISTINCT],
Wimpey, Taylor Woodrow, all those guys are

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.730
going to buy the electric bath. This is a
business with massive potential or death and

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.770
after, you know, after getting quite--seriously
quite excited about it for awhile, always

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.280
realized that when they would ultimately have
to go and sell these ideas to people that

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.959
might invest and give them cash to who wins
their business, they were going to have to

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:05.359
get past this one issue, the death trap issue.
But, you see, I would have been a great investor,

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:08.579
straight to the point. And so it never actually
made it to business plan phase. Luckily, some

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:14.510
other ideas, the [INDISTINCT] and... It's
amazing actually because the electric bath

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:20.570
is our favorite comedy idea that didn't work.
We get sent quite lot of ideas now. People

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.500
are going, oh, you know, Innocent, you seem
like quite a friendly approach with people.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.560
I have this idea for business and I think
you should make, you know, maybe you could

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:36.780
help me develop my idea for the cat bag, which
is--it's an amazing device, people have cats

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.970
and cats shed hair. I have a lovely flat and
I love my cat but there's hair everywhere.

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.150
What I'd love is this little, like, boiler
suit bag thing that I can put my cat in, and

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:51.640
so my flat will be clear and there will be
no hair in the flat. My cat could be happy

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.620
and I also support [INDISTINCT] boiler suit
bag thing, without, you know, but without

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:01.490
that person getting to the second step, which
is a like--what happens when the cat wants

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.930
to go poo. What happens then? I don't want
to be near the bag then. What happens when

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.750
the cat wants to do other stuff, run free?
How you going to take the bag off? But we

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:15.580
got--we seriously got send out as a business
idea that somebody believed in. The other

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:20.430
one--and there's a theme here. The other one
was dog nappies. We've been pitched dog nappies

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:25.640
because one of the scourges of life is the
fact that you spread dog poo in the park,

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.550
and wouldn't it be great if dogs just have
little, you know, little nappies they walked

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:34.060
around in and then you're going to have to,
like, scoop up with a plastic bag and they'll

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.691
[INAUDIBLE]. So you make a couple of ideas
here if you fancy and start your own business,

00:05:36.691 --> 00:05:48.010
cat bag, nappies. I have thought really stupidly.
I pitched three or four ideas to you there

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:52.900
quite quickly, which is what we were trying
to do back--about 10 years ago. What we realized

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.910
by the end of it in terms of having a great
idea was that we subsequently come up with

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:03.370
this thing called the Granny Test. In Hollywood
it would be the Elevator Pitch where you are

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:08.300
an aspiring screenwriter and you've got, you
know, you bump into Steven Spielberg on the

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:14.630
left and say, right, Spielberg, I've got a
great idea for a movie, it features a cat

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:20.530
that wears a bag and this dog and a nappy,
is going to be amazing. And you have that,

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:24.750
you know, you have that 10 seconds to maybe
make your [INDISTINCT] or fall flat in your

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:28.880
face. Our thing is slightly more prosaic because
we know that you're not going to bump in Spielberg

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.140
that often. Also, this is called the Granny
Test because most people got a granny. If

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:36.111
you don't have a granny, you can borrow somebody
else's granny to [INDISTINCT] around. And

00:06:36.111 --> 00:06:42.900
if you can't explain your business idea in
over a cup of tea with your granny, then it's

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:47.940
rubbish, then it sucks, because, you know,
your granny sees they're going to--you know,

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:52.990
if you get, "Oh, that's nice, dear. That's
okay. That's pretty. That might work," if

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:57.840
you just get a blank look and more tea, then
it's probably--it's probably not going to

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:02.150
work. Well, I think, in seriousness, testing
out in your friends and your family is the

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:07.740
only--is the only sure way it's beginning
to work out, that it's going to work. Like

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:12.880
that whole [INDISTINCT], because I don't--I
want to understand what's going on inside

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.630
[INDISTINCT] chap's brains apart from what's
probably not there. Maybe they--they broke

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:27.020
the mold. Or maybe the grannies were really
clever. So the second law of--or the second

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:32.140
bit we get to is, so having a great idea is
crucial for every business. I've come to skip

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:37.080
through it in five minutes with a few funnies,
but actually, you know, it's rare that great

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:43.020
ideas come. What we've also learned is that
when you think, "I've got a ton of ideas to

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:46.720
start a business," you start thinking like
an inventor. You start thinking that you've

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:52.680
got to invent something that nobody has ever
seen before. And, actually, what you tend

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:57.230
to do is not be an inventor. You tend to just
be an improver or an adapter, just tend to

00:07:57.230 --> 00:08:00.680
make things a bit better. So Smoothie has
all ready existed, right? We just make them

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:07.560
better, which got better ingredients. We created,
you know, a business and a brand that we think

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:14.490
sold the idea of Smoothies better to people.
We didn't invent. We're not crazy guys with

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:21.800
beards hiding in sheds. I have a shed. But
then, when you've had your idea, you got to

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:27.790
start and that's--arguably, that's even more
difficult than having the idea, because where

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:36.450
do we start. So where do we buy 10 tons of
mangoes? Who's got--do we need a machine,

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:41.539
or do we just do it ourselves? Do we just
hire loads of people to chalk it up? What

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:45.660
about bottles? Where do you get the bottles
from? We have to make those? And then somebody

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:50.440
is going to get them all in the shops. We
didn't know any of this stuff. We really didn't

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:55.230
know any of this stuff. And so, the starting
part is the hardest part because you just

00:08:55.230 --> 00:09:01.889
have to start somewhere. You just have to--how
many people in this room have done, say, a

00:09:01.889 --> 00:09:09.970
dissertation or a Ph.D., thesis, or something
in their time in education? How many of you?

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:15.600
And how many of you started without delaying,
without procrastination, without futzing around,

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:20.420
without drinking coffee, without just not
doing it for quite a lot of time? How many

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:27.220
of you just started like that? Come on, geeks.
Come on. Somebody did. No, you don't. You

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:32.100
don't. Even if you kind of know--even if you
kind of know what you're going to do, the

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:37.550
human race is based on a healthy dose of procrastination,
and it's the same in starting a business.

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:43.420
You don't really know where and when to start.
I guess in the end, we finally figured out.

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:47.709
It wasn't about the fact that we didn't know
how to make Smoothies. It was more of the

00:09:47.709 --> 00:09:52.009
point that we didn't really know if anyone
would like them, would like the stuff we were

00:09:52.009 --> 00:09:58.800
going to make. And so the place where we started
was in August '98 and that was in Parsons

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:04.100
Green, you know, Parsons Green and it's about
[INDISTINCT]. It's a small triangle of land

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:12.209
and this used to be small [INDISTINCT], on
the green, and we took a stall there, a small

00:10:12.209 --> 00:10:16.800
stall. I've got a sign up above the stall
saying, "Do you think we should give up our

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:22.800
day jobs?" And we had a bin, one that said
yes, and a bin that said no, and lots of smoothies,

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:27.800
lots of homemade proto smoothies on this table
and asked people about [INDISTINCT] come to

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:31.809
try them that weekend, to just tell us if
they like them. And that was how--that was

00:10:31.809 --> 00:10:37.629
how we started and that's--that's one of those
stories about Innocent that we've told lots

00:10:37.629 --> 00:10:41.139
of times to lots of people. And the more you
tell it, the more it starts turning into this

00:10:41.139 --> 00:10:47.350
weird myth. And you know, Bryan Blessed was
there, I think, and he tried to... And Paul

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:52.910
[INDISTINCT], he was there. There were all
these amazing people there, actually, [INDISTINCT].

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:59.720
It's not why I've told you those two there,
but anyway. I guess what I'm trying to say

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:05.699
is that we really did it. We really did test
our drink that way with those people, by putting

00:11:05.699 --> 00:11:12.740
the sign up and we made it--but we made it
that little tipping point, because between

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:17.629
the three of them, Rich and Adam, they'd agreed
on that weekend, if enough people say yes,

00:11:17.629 --> 00:11:21.980
if enough people throw their empties in to
the yes bin, so we should give up our day

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:26.300
jobs. On Monday, we gave up our jobs. And
unluckily--luckily for us now, but unlucky

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:30.370
for them at that time, because it kind of
freaked out, the yes bin was full at the end

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:37.110
of the weekend and the no bin was empty, apart
from three bottles from their [INDISTINCT].

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:44.139
They--on the Monday, they resigned from their
seemingly decent well-paying jobs and started.

00:11:44.139 --> 00:11:49.240
In fact, that's a story we've always told.
They only told me while I was writing the

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:54.139
book about somebody called the chairman with
a consultant on the Sunday evening, because

00:11:54.139 --> 00:12:03.600
now, we were really scared that we actually
have to do it, that the people had spoken,

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:08.899
the people of Parsons Green. They actually
had to go in and write their resignation letters.

00:12:08.899 --> 00:12:11.930
The chairman at this point [INDISTINCT] piece,
and they said, "If it flips, if we flip it

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:17.410
and it's three times the same way, then we
definitely have to give up our jobs." And

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:21.389
it was three tails and they've kept the chairman.
He's at work. This is ultimately like the

00:12:21.389 --> 00:12:26.680
big template used to get in the olden days.
And so, you know, thanks to the chairman,

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:30.639
we started the business on Monday--and the
people of Parsons Green, of course. And has

00:12:30.639 --> 00:12:39.309
anyone ever seen our drinks with the one with
all the little hats? So we do that. We do

00:12:39.309 --> 00:12:43.809
that once a year, in the winter, and that
raises money for Age Concern, gets money back

00:12:43.809 --> 00:12:49.279
to a lot of elderly people who need to help
with paying their heating bills. And this

00:12:49.279 --> 00:12:53.120
is a great idea--sorry, you'd have to read
the print. I just put it up there because

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:56.449
I have to grab it quickly. This guy down at
the bottom, Adam, he is called new Adam because

00:12:56.449 --> 00:13:01.720
we already have an Adam, so he is new Adam.
And he came to work with us after a couple

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:09.959
of years and he has this thing where he knits.
He is a bit of a softie and a very lovely

00:13:09.959 --> 00:13:17.899
man. And I think he knitted the first ever
little hat. See, for all that, it looked nice.

00:13:17.899 --> 00:13:25.089
A hat in it, well, yeah, it does, right? Could
you do some work now? And he suggested this

00:13:25.089 --> 00:13:28.939
idea, wouldn't it be great if, what, you know,
for a certain period, all the bottles in all

00:13:28.939 --> 00:13:31.970
the shops have the little hats. Wouldn't that
be great? Well, yeah, but how about, you know,

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:36.499
how are we going to do that? Who is going
to do the hats? You know, all those questions,

00:13:36.499 --> 00:13:37.813
all those panicky questions when a big idea
is sort of volunteered. How are we going to

00:13:37.813 --> 00:13:43.199
do it? Who is going to do it? Who's going
to put the hats on? What does it mean? Is

00:13:43.199 --> 00:13:46.119
it, you know, are the supermarkets going to
kick us out? Is there a health and safety

00:13:46.119 --> 00:13:51.279
thing? You know, everyone worrying, and actually,
Adam is--where we sit, we kind of chanced

00:13:51.279 --> 00:13:55.723
it. We said, well, if you think you can make
it work, make it work. Do it. And so he did.

00:13:55.723 --> 00:13:59.519
And in the first year--I think it says up
there--a few thousand, a few thousand on the

00:13:59.519 --> 00:14:05.949
shelves, not much impact. The next year, a
few more, you have few more. But he did it

00:14:05.949 --> 00:14:07.119
last year, you know, half a million hats on
the shelves, all the stalls in [INDISTINCT],

00:14:07.119 --> 00:14:14.279
I think, we did it with last year. Every [INDISTINCT]
store and raised, you know, 4 million quid

00:14:14.279 --> 00:14:23.079
for Age Concern, and it's just a little micro
example of how if you have a really, you know,

00:14:23.079 --> 00:14:25.970
seemingly quite dumb idea, but mighty quite
amusing. You know, but you sit down and you

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:31.339
make it work and you actually just start doing
it. It's the starting that seems to be the

00:14:31.339 --> 00:14:38.730
thing. Anyway, that's what we think. Now,
one of my favorite ladies, [INDISTINCT] on

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:48.339
TV [INDISTINCT]. Is anyone familiar with her?
With Pam AKA [INDISTINCT]? Yeah? Who doesn't

00:14:48.339 --> 00:14:54.800
know who she is? Okay. That doesn't matter,
because you can see from here that she is

00:14:54.800 --> 00:15:00.910
a striking lady and a very important lady.
And we have another test. So we have the granny

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:06.009
test. But our starting idea is called--is
the East Enders test, patterned after East

00:15:06.009 --> 00:15:15.589
Enders, the TV soap. And it goes a bit like
this that, usually, when you have an idea

00:15:15.589 --> 00:15:19.639
for business, you have another job, right?
You may be working at Google or at Innocent,

00:15:19.639 --> 00:15:24.800
you may have this idea that you have all your
friends that you really need to start, but

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:30.399
you get home and, you know, East Enders is
on and there's some wine, and I'm just going

00:15:30.399 --> 00:15:33.810
to sit down and drink some wine and watch
East Enders and maybe work on the business

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:37.610
thing tomorrow, you know, or maybe in the
weekend. I'll do it in the weekend, you know,

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:42.279
when there is no danger of East Enders being
on TV, but they might be dangerous for some

00:15:42.279 --> 00:15:49.189
wine. And people, again, people just procrastinate,
people don't get to it. The test is, test

00:15:49.189 --> 00:15:53.610
is, don't watch East Enders tonight, don't
drink the wine, don't watch When Pets Turn

00:15:53.610 --> 00:16:02.010
Bad, don't watch--don't watch anything. Turn
off, get rid of all booze and sit down and

00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:05.760
write your business plan, or talk to your
friends and plan how you're going to start

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:10.399
your business. There is no other way and there
is no better time than tonight when you get

00:16:10.399 --> 00:16:16.019
home. I'm not advocating everyone in the room.
You could get in trouble from the people in-charge.

00:16:16.019 --> 00:16:22.129
But the East Enders test, again, is just another
test of whether, I guess, whether you are

00:16:22.129 --> 00:16:25.879
entrepreneurially minded and whether you get--whether
you really care about your idea as well. So

00:16:25.879 --> 00:16:34.439
that's the East Enders test. Go, go away.
Great. Okay. So does anyone know what car

00:16:34.439 --> 00:16:45.059
this is? Punto? It's not the Punto. It's the
Uno, the Uno, the Fiat Uno. It's a great car.

00:16:45.059 --> 00:16:54.329
And persistence, so far what we've done, we
have an idea and we've made ourselves start,

00:16:54.329 --> 00:17:00.050
you know, stop whatever it is, start the business.
And so at this point when you go to see people

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:05.079
and say we got this great idea and we just
started, we started to make some smoothies

00:17:05.079 --> 00:17:11.319
and people really liked them--and, hi, Mr.
Big Juice Maker, can you make our drinks?

00:17:11.319 --> 00:17:19.769
No. No. Why can't you make it? Well, the haven't
got any preservatives in, I haven't got the

00:17:19.769 --> 00:17:23.709
additives to make them cheaper, they don't
use concentrates and sure, they're going to

00:17:23.709 --> 00:17:27.079
go off really quickly and no one is going
to buy them because they're too expensive.

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:32.880
So that's basically what we heard for--well,
every time we went and talked to anyone who

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:42.779
would be able to help us make our drinks.
And so I'm just--I already get really upset.

00:17:42.779 --> 00:17:51.860
This then is missing out. We have to be super,
super persistent, really persistent, because

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:57.080
everyone tells you, no, because you're nobody,
right? You're just three blokes with a Fiat

00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:04.221
Uno. And one meeting in particular sticks
out. It was in Wales. It was down [INDISTINCT],

00:18:04.221 --> 00:18:06.539
quite a long drive with some people who made
drinks and they make big, they made such a

00:18:06.539 --> 00:18:10.670
scale that we couldn't believe it. We thought
they might have a little machine in the corner

00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:17.480
that we could start using, you know, and make
our drinks, if you don't mind. And we had

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:24.039
to ask. We had to ask everyone. That's what
this thing is about, just being persistent.

00:18:24.039 --> 00:18:29.029
We asked everyone. Well, this was a special
day because Adams, Fiat Uno, which was the

00:18:29.029 --> 00:18:33.060
company car at that time, which he'd got on
his 17th birthday, so it must have been about

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:38.590
almost approaching 10 years old. And he got
into his car. He remodeled it because it didn't

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:42.090
have electric windows. He'd installed his
own electric window on the driver's side.

00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:45.539
I actually thought that was really cool when
he was 17. It was really uncool when you're

00:18:45.539 --> 00:18:52.649
27 because the electric window didn't work
and it was always stuck. It got stuck down.

00:18:52.649 --> 00:18:57.700
And so driving to Wales in the rain with the
window stuck down in really sort of cheap

00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:02.640
suits, but trying to look like businessmen,
but, you know, obviously not really [INDISTINCT].

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:10.880
And getting all the way down and being late
and being very wet in the car, fashioning

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:17.570
impromptu windows out of newspapers and magazines
in bags and stuff, and getting there and getting

00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:24.740
out of the car and the car park, it was right
where the meeting room window was--they looked

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:30.720
out, basically, on these idiots who arrived.
And we got out and we're bedraggled, getting

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:34.000
there with little bits of paper for their
PowerPoint ready and went, "Oh, what do we

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:42.080
do," and went in, and we're offered towels.
Our reception, the only business to leave

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:49.429
a wet patch in reception, we [INDISTINCT],
and then getting to the meeting room and establishing

00:19:49.429 --> 00:19:54.440
pretty much after about seven minutes, there's
absolutely nothing they could do for us. We

00:19:54.440 --> 00:20:00.539
offered them nothing of interest either. We'd
driven all that way and got very wet for nothing.

00:20:00.539 --> 00:20:04.380
But they were very kind because they offered
us petty money for the way back, and that's

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:11.990
very true. The interesting thing is, the interesting
thing is now [INDISTINCT] you there or not.

00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:15.179
I'm not going to because this doesn't really
matter. But we worked with this business now.

00:20:15.179 --> 00:20:19.770
We put millions of pounds of business their
way, you know, every day, every week. No,

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:26.280
for every year, that means [INDISTINCT] every
day, I'd get fired. That's not my part of

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:33.389
business. And we spend a lot of money with
them and I don't know if there are still people

00:20:33.389 --> 00:20:38.600
from that day 10 years ago. We don't talk
about that day with them anyway. But it's

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:44.730
just a strange thing, this little loop back
then, you know, about being persistent we've

00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:50.510
become one of their biggest customers, which
is a bit crazy. I need to tell you their office

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:54.679
is pretty uninteresting. But on the Fiat Uno,
the Fiat Uno, the only thing I can say about

00:20:54.679 --> 00:20:57.539
Fiat Uno is, I was delivering a fridge to
[INDISTINCT] for our second year, still our

00:20:57.539 --> 00:21:03.889
company car, slash delivery van slash everything
else, and it caught fire in [INDISTINCT] and

00:21:03.889 --> 00:21:10.240
High street and the engine blew up and I just
leapt away like Steven Seagal from the blaze,

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:21.110
but Adam was really cursing me because it
was his favorite car. Okay. That's just a

00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:26.529
little picture of the inside of the entrepreneur's
brain, because that's what happens, is that

00:21:26.529 --> 00:21:32.110
everyone tells you no. I always remember going
to a factory where they do the--put a print

00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:44.559
on the cap, because they don't have any bottle
with it. Yeah, great. On the top, on the cap,

00:21:44.559 --> 00:21:53.510
it says, instead of best before, it says,
"Enjoy by." And we used to have quite a big

00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:59.960
discussion with the guy who operated the machine,
that prints on the cap, because we wanted

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:08.080
it to say, "enjoy by," because we think use
by, it's a really weird thing, how do I use

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:14.260
a smoothie? I mean, I don't use it. I, you
know, I enjoy it. I drink it. I enjoy it.

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:15.260
I imbibe, whatever so, you know, whatever
word you've got in there, we figured that

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:18.880
the people of Great Britain and further afield
were smart enough to understand by "enjoy"

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:23.139
that I meant, you know, best to drink it before
that day. But then, going to factory and trying

00:22:23.139 --> 00:22:28.929
to explain that to the guy, you know, you'd
say, "Can we put 'enjoy by' on top?" And didn't

00:22:28.929 --> 00:22:33.429
say, like... See, it worked, you know. Well,
we've actually put "best before" on the label

00:22:33.429 --> 00:22:38.679
there, and we say, "For best before date,
see cap," because then they want to know what

00:22:38.679 --> 00:22:48.500
that means anyway. Yeah, but there is way
we can do it, because what we do, we go to

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:56.750
the machine and we go "E-N-J-O-Y." You need
to go so we can do that. We can break through.

00:22:56.750 --> 00:23:01.770
And after a few discussions, after [INDISTINCT]
getting really bored with us, we did it. We

00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:05.452
changed it and, you know, "on your head be
it" type thing, we did get told off about

00:23:05.452 --> 00:23:09.360
it a few times by the trading standards officer
that looked at our products, but we sent a

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:13.340
few letters and it eventually worked, established
that we were fine to do it. And so to this

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:19.693
day, we still say "enjoy by" on the caps and
that was just because we didn't, you know,

00:23:19.693 --> 00:23:22.910
we were persistent and we didn't just listen
to all the nos, because people will always

00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:29.510
tell you, no. I don't know. I mean, even now
at Innocent, I guess, in Google, you know,

00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:32.990
you'll have an idea for something and you
find quite a few people to tell you what works,

00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:42.289
what can't work, well, you know, that won't
work. It's all our duties to kind of politely

00:23:42.289 --> 00:23:48.139
ignore yes and move on. And Richard tells
an interesting story and I don't, you know,

00:23:48.139 --> 00:23:53.750
when he first told me this I was like, "Yeah,
that's not true." It's really not true, because

00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:59.190
that's sort of the story that you hear in
class, but he swears it's true. His dad is

00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:03.950
from Liverpool and went to school with a bloke
named Paul McCartney. He was in the same class

00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:08.520
at school, and always remembers the day when
you have--at the end of [INDISTINCT], you're

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:11.779
allowed to do what you want, bring in--for
you, you bring something in. Paul McCartney

00:24:11.779 --> 00:24:17.390
brought in his guitar who was about 10 or
12 years old, and the teacher, basically,

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:26.650
says to him, said, [INDISTINCT]. I'm lucky.
[INDISTINCT] know Paul McCartney? So I think

00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:39.809
that was an awful response. It's harsh. [INDISTINCT]?
Yeah. Okay. Anyway, good. So, this is about

00:24:39.809 --> 00:24:45.080
people, because then, it's what we do. We
have an idea, we started, we just started,

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:50.049
then we're really persistent, so we kind of
got the products up and running, and then

00:24:50.049 --> 00:24:54.269
there's a bit where you have to find some
people to help you because, you know, three

00:24:54.269 --> 00:24:57.509
people wasn't enough and then four people
wasn't enough, and then six, and then ten,

00:24:57.509 --> 00:25:02.301
then twenty. I guess there's no better example
in the world than Google finding great people

00:25:02.301 --> 00:25:05.929
and finding lots of great people quite quickly.
Hey, you're all great, by the way. So, I saw

00:25:05.929 --> 00:25:15.399
this guy speak once. He was head of talent
at Apple, he has got around the world finding

00:25:15.399 --> 00:25:21.630
great people to work at Apple and he was talking
to a lady. He told the lady about this, actually.

00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:26.130
He told the lady about snipers. You know,
she was in a business of a certain size and

00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:32.179
she was saying, well, you know, we've got
to this size now where there's a few hundred

00:25:32.179 --> 00:25:36.789
of us in the business and there's loads of
great people. There's a few people that are

00:25:36.789 --> 00:25:41.250
always having to go, you know, aren't particularly
positive, complaining about stuff, moaning,

00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:47.200
you know, just--and he said, well, you mean
snipers? She said, yeah, they're snipers because

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:52.049
they're people kind of you can't see, who
are just chipping away at the fabric of the

00:25:52.049 --> 00:25:55.620
business. And that's when he came out with
this and he said, well, you know, look--he

00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:59.909
wasn't referring to bullet holes. Let's be
absolutely clear about that. He was just referring

00:25:59.909 --> 00:26:03.799
to if you, you know, if there are people who
aren't working in your business, this is quite

00:26:03.799 --> 00:26:08.929
sort of tough thing to hear, especially for
somebody, for us as a business, Innocent,

00:26:08.929 --> 00:26:13.920
which was quite small and friendly and, you
know, slightly meek at the beginning, and

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:20.580
to hear--well, if people aren't working, then
they go, you know. This, businesses with the

00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:27.309
wrong people in them ain't going to work.
And the story follows for when you hire people,

00:26:27.309 --> 00:26:31.120
making sure you get the right person. There's
kind of a--there's a culture sometimes and

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:35.700
we've done it at Innocent a few times, because
we've been so desperate to get the right number

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:40.210
of people into building to do the right things.
You panic and you get people too quickly and

00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:46.429
you haven't really taken the time to check
whether they're going to fit…I guess, culturally

00:26:46.429 --> 00:26:48.889
is the word. You know, you got to make sure--there
is a culture of Google, there is a culture

00:26:48.889 --> 00:26:53.920
of Innocent, and the people that come in and
work at our place have to be spot on in that

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:58.080
regard. And if they're not, then we just leave
the gap and we wait, and we wait, and we wait.

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:03.820
And, you know, it takes two years to finally
find the right person. Our head of products,

00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:09.830
Lucy, who basically is responsible for inventing
new smoothies and inventing new recipes and

00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:17.559
new products, we waited ages for her. We used
to send her letters, a leaflet stuck outside

00:27:17.559 --> 00:27:25.559
her house, and we were on the line, I think,
but she didn't mind, I think. She still works

00:27:25.559 --> 00:27:29.610
for us. But we really persisted in--we knew
that if we had her in the building, we'd have

00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:34.629
somebody who can invent the right products
for us, and we didn't have that, and we decided

00:27:34.629 --> 00:27:35.629
it was her, so we just kept going back to
her and back to her. We had this--we had a

00:27:35.629 --> 00:27:43.539
bit of a gap. You know, we were just waiting
to get her, but we need, you know, she's here

00:27:43.539 --> 00:27:50.370
today inventing good stuff. So no snipers,
no assholes, sounds really tough, but I'm

00:27:50.370 --> 00:28:00.400
the last one. Just get great people for building.
Anyone know these people? Sometimes one person

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:04.289
knows Longaberger. Can anyone guess what Longaberger
do?

00:28:04.289 --> 00:28:09.759
&gt;&gt; Baskets.
&gt;&gt; GERMAIN: Yes, very good. I know some people

00:28:09.759 --> 00:28:14.440
would say, they, like, make picnics, or they
do, you know, just something like that, but

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:20.700
you knew. That's good. Longaberger make baskets,
and I think they're based in Columbus, Ohio,

00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:26.120
and I think in the U.S. is pretty much the
biggest manufacturer of the shopping basket

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:31.169
that you get in the supermarket through to
this executive wicker, picnic hamper and they

00:28:31.169 --> 00:28:37.381
do all sorts of baskets. And I like Longaberger
a lot and I have for a long time because they

00:28:37.381 --> 00:28:43.950
built a giant basket. They built a massive
basket somewhere in Ohio and if you go to

00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:48.350
longaberger.com, usually I say afterwards,
but this is definitely the first talk I've

00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:54.820
had when more people have got laptops than
have no laptops, but it's--that's the culture.

00:28:54.820 --> 00:29:02.789
You can just see loads of shots of the Longaberger
building, lit at night, in different angles,

00:29:02.789 --> 00:29:07.250
across the lake. I mean, it's definitely a
thing of beauty. The thing I love the most,

00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:12.549
the thing I love the most about Longaberger,
the Longaberger building isn't the--isn't

00:29:12.549 --> 00:29:17.799
just the fact that the basket exists, it's
the fact that there was a meeting and there

00:29:17.799 --> 00:29:23.340
was a meeting in the big room. Is there a
special room here where the big stuff gets

00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:33.650
decided? No? You do have? No oak paneling?
Okay. Awful lot of respect for you. There's

00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:38.490
a room, probably, but it wasn't in there because
they haven't build it at that time, but somewhere

00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:43.639
where the board of Longaberger, I guess, the
chief executive, the MD, the CEO, whoever

00:29:43.639 --> 00:29:47.470
it is, of the company have to sit down and
make a decision. And ultimately, one person

00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:52.270
has to make a decision like this, it's the
budget for the new HQ, and it is millions

00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:57.500
of dollars, millions. It's the most they've
ever spent on anything. And that person has

00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:03.639
to decide whether to build the giant basket
or not, or whether to build a pretty regular,

00:30:03.639 --> 00:30:08.750
you know, regular new HQ bit, like the last
one with better lifts, you know, or build

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:15.000
that. And somebody decided to build that one.
One person has to decide. This isn't--that

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.789
didn't happen by accident and so that's why
I love them. That's why I love them because

00:30:18.789 --> 00:30:23.320
I get the feeling. If I were to work there
and if I met that person and if I met everyone

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:28.990
who worked there, there would be a real shared
sense of purpose about what we were doing,

00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:35.649
you know. You don't forget what you're doing
if you work in there. You know where you're

00:30:35.649 --> 00:30:43.230
going. You know where you're--you know even
when you're five miles away in a cloudy Monday

00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:47.340
morning, you know what you do, because it's
there. So I love Longaberger, because they--because

00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:55.150
ultimately the main thing, you know, everything
is marketing, right? There is old marketing

00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:59.710
where, posters and stuff in TV and now, of
course, it's digital, you know, that kind

00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:04.520
of old, it must be a picture and some words,
but that isn't marketing. You know, marketing

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:07.909
is everything, and that's--they don't have
to--I don't think they do ads. I don't think

00:31:07.909 --> 00:31:14.770
they need to do ads? They just need to show
people, invite people over. They're fine.

00:31:14.770 --> 00:31:25.399
These people have some work to do. When we
started Innocent, our--that was our name,

00:31:25.399 --> 00:31:31.779
where we [INDISTINCT] Innocent. We had a handful
of innocents at that time. The first label

00:31:31.779 --> 00:31:37.070
we designed was the now-really-famous-fast-tractor
smoothie brand. I don't know if you can see

00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:42.570
that on the really fast tractor, which is
really suited up is the guy sitting there

00:31:42.570 --> 00:31:47.009
who is, you know, looking really happy, and
big old sideburns, he's probably a farmer

00:31:47.009 --> 00:31:53.279
and the idea was--what we were all about was
getting fruit from the country to town really

00:31:53.279 --> 00:31:58.409
quickly so it would be super fresh. We had
a really fast tractor to help us do that and

00:31:58.409 --> 00:32:04.539
we thought it was a great brand name. And,
you know, it might have been. I don't know.

00:32:04.539 --> 00:32:10.389
We might be sitting here talking about a different
business today. That might be the great name.

00:32:10.389 --> 00:32:15.960
We had some other names on the list. We found--this
was the best thing we found during the trawling

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:23.450
for stuff to put in the book. It's the list
of names and there was Monkey Vomit. There

00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:30.639
was Hungry Aphid. There was one called, and
there were little comments in the spreadsheet

00:32:30.639 --> 00:32:38.690
like, "Why is this a good name and why this
isn't a good name?" It's really--what was

00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:42.769
one of them? Hey, that's just a bit too aroma
therapy, at least comments that worked. I

00:32:42.769 --> 00:32:46.720
don't know what they--I don't know what we're
thinking at that time, but I'm really glad

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:50.460
that we call it Innocent. I'm really glad
it wasn't monkey vomit or fast tractor. But,

00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:54.720
you know, where we started from--where we
started from just this little bottle on the

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:59.720
shelf, packaging is becoming incredibly important
to us. It was and still is our prime bit of

00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:06.370
appetizing media, whatever space, you know,
to talk to people. Yeah, we do other conventional

00:33:06.370 --> 00:33:10.529
bits of marketing, but I still believe that,
you know, the pack is the place where we interact

00:33:10.529 --> 00:33:15.350
with people, a place where we talk to people,
and really have it called Innocent and not

00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:19.899
fast tractor, or else our tone, our style
would have to go down a whole different flight,

00:33:19.899 --> 00:33:25.080
you know, we would have to do farmer jokes
for 10 years. Red sky at night, you know,

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:31.929
where the smoothies really shine. Hilarious,
hilarious jokes like that. So we've made the

00:33:31.929 --> 00:33:38.019
pack our place, you know, what we do on the
back of the pack is free rein, you know. I

00:33:38.019 --> 00:33:44.309
remember how many conversation right at the
beginning which was--is a bit on a lot of

00:33:44.309 --> 00:33:48.960
packaging which says, "Your statutory rights
are not affected." Okay, I don't know what

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:55.370
my statutory rights are. Oh, dear. And I don't
think I've been affected. Do you think anyone

00:33:55.370 --> 00:34:01.460
else knows what they are? No. Let's not put
it on there. You know, all these things that

00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:05.750
you've seen on packaging and stuff throughout
your life, you just think, "Oh, well, we don't--do

00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:09.770
we need that?" Well, if anyone tells us we
need it, then we might put it back on later.

00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:14.670
We just took loads of stuff off, which left
us loads of room for just having bit of fun,

00:34:14.670 --> 00:34:18.800
which is bringing pictures of stuff that we'd
like, talking about things that we're interested

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:22.800
in, not necessarily fruit-related, not necessarily
health-related, just stuff, because people

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:27.190
like stuff, you know. People get bored if
you're just telling them the same things all

00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:31.090
the time. People are more interested in...
We've got a picture of a little, the second

00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:34.740
one from the left, that was really a small
dog with a jumper on, then people are going

00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:40.599
to like that. I like dogs that wear jumpers.
The most important thing, obviously, apart

00:34:40.599 --> 00:34:46.960
from the [INDISTINCT] when it comes down to
it is the stuff in the bottle, because in

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:49.780
the beginning we wrote this big marketing
plan. It was, you know, we're going to do

00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:54.460
this and that, and one day we'll have a TV
advert and we'll, you know, we're going to

00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:57.480
do this crazy thing [INDISTINCT]. Actually,
the only thing that people will really come

00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:02.079
back to is good products. It doesn't matter
how fancy our bottles are, it doesn't matter

00:35:02.079 --> 00:35:06.900
how good our website is, it doesn't matter
that we, you know, that we have a Twitter,

00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:10.990
a goddamned Twitter feed. It doesn't matter
about any of those things really because when

00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:15.369
people put the bottle into their mouth and
drink it, if it tastes rubbish, they will

00:35:15.369 --> 00:35:20.300
not buy again. So you can do what you can
to kind of attract people to go to the fridge

00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:24.849
in the first place, without anything that
you can then do and 95 percent of the work

00:35:24.849 --> 00:35:30.160
that we have to do is make the product great.
After that, it's fine. After that, it's just

00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:36.460
all gravy. And so, finding the best fruit,
getting in the kitchen, chopping into small

00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:39.940
pieces, putting it into a blender, that's
how we invent the recipes, we don't have any

00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:45.180
secret methodology. We buy fruit, we put it
in the blender, we mix it up, the stuff that

00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:48.880
tastes good, we work it out to make it to
scale and then we put it in the shops. It's

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:54.290
pretty damn straightforward. And so making
great products is the only thing we care about.

00:35:54.290 --> 00:35:59.950
So the pretty good things that worth the hardest
in the last few years is actually going backwards,

00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:03.910
finding out where does great fruit come from,
because they're going to be truly huge. Want

00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:09.130
to be big, want to be successful, want to
be profitable, want to be popular, and we're

00:36:09.130 --> 00:36:12.920
going to be all those things, if we're going
to do all that, then we need to taste better

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:16.839
than everyone else and we need to know who's
got the best fruit. So, our--the team has

00:36:16.839 --> 00:36:21.034
grown proportionately the biggest in Innocent
for the last few years is the procurement

00:36:21.034 --> 00:36:24.880
team. They are the lucky people that get to
go to Costa Rica, or Uganda, or India to find

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:30.030
great fruit. They're the people with all the--like
all the cool travel gear, they got the best

00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:37.130
bags that fold out into camp beds and falls
out into everything else. You know, they just--they're

00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:39.859
always on the road and I'm really jealous
because I don't get to go on those trips.

00:36:39.859 --> 00:36:47.550
But finding the best fruit is the thing. I
think I've got a few more minutes. Has anyone

00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:53.349
got any questions to the end just so I know
so I can save my time? Yeah, cool. Okay. Somebody

00:36:53.349 --> 00:36:59.660
asked. Where is that--where is that young
man who asked me about a banana phone? This

00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:06.420
is the banana phone. It's on a special velvet
cushion on a plinth. We have a lot of time

00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:10.690
to [INDISTINCT] our phone. We bought it in
Woolworths on Portobello Road right when we

00:37:10.690 --> 00:37:14.460
began, which is our office was just on the
other road. We needed a phone in the office.

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:24.030
We thought it would be hilarious to have one
of fruit. And there it is. It's real. It still

00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:30.010
exists. At the time when we first bought it,
it was the Batphone, you know, it was the

00:37:30.010 --> 00:37:33.680
one phone in the office and when it went off
it was like, "Ah, who is calling?" "I don't

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:39.600
know. You have to pick up the phone to find
out." You know, it was the thing that could--it

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:46.690
could be the guy from [INDISTINCT], that we're
not--you know, what we're going to do? We

00:37:46.690 --> 00:37:50.160
want that whole aisle to be your stuff. Whatever
you want, just have it. Or it could be--more

00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:53.119
likely, which is your mom asking if you're
coming home in the weekend, will you bring

00:37:53.119 --> 00:37:57.010
the [INDISTINCT]. Or, you know, just--but
you never knew who it was. It's very exciting.

00:37:57.010 --> 00:38:01.360
Picking that phone up was a special moment.
And you'd go, hello, Innocent banana phone

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:07.090
and wait for the magic. And we didn't plan
this, but now at Innocent, when people pick

00:38:07.090 --> 00:38:14.589
up the phone, if it's that number which has
been dialed, there's this crack team of people

00:38:14.589 --> 00:38:15.589
that are devoted to answering the Innocent
banana phone, they call the people's champions,

00:38:15.589 --> 00:38:20.910
they are just there to talk to people about
stuff. It might be a complaint, it might be

00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:27.700
about the smoothie. It might be praise. It
might be, you know, just somebody who wants

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:29.580
to ask a question, something who wants to
tell us where they've been on holiday. It

00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:34.272
could be anything at all. But they all come
to our banana phone. And if it doesn't get

00:38:34.272 --> 00:38:40.380
answered in three rings, then every phone
in the office rings, every desk, every desk

00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:47.460
rings, which is great, right, because it means
those guys might already be in a call and

00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:48.460
it means that everyone in the office gets
to talk to whoever, who could it be, I don't

00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:52.900
know, you have to pick up the phone to find
out. It could be anyone. And usually, basically,

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:57.660
it's the people that make our business work.
So if somebody who has spent one pound seventy-nine--not

00:38:57.660 --> 00:39:02.820
you, [INDISTINCT]--somebody has spent, somebody
has spent one pound and seventy-nine on buying

00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:06.270
a drink and wants to tell us about it and,
man, we need to--we really need to listen

00:39:06.270 --> 00:39:11.150
to that person, and listen to the next time
he phones and the next time, and the next

00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:17.650
time, because without them, we have no wages,
we have no business. They have the phone us.

00:39:17.650 --> 00:39:21.829
We have to be phoned by them. The moment that
we get, you know, we kind of outsource that

00:39:21.829 --> 00:39:26.660
bit and we don't know where those calls are
going and exactly what's happening with those

00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:30.650
calls is the moment when I definitely start
worrying, when the reason we started Innocent

00:39:30.650 --> 00:39:36.720
in the first place starts to kind of… So,
although it's just a plastic phone, it sums

00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:43.290
up, you know, a greater relief and a high
purpose, or something like that. That's our

00:39:43.290 --> 00:39:49.900
front door and we have... Again, we did that
because we thought it would be funny for just

00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:51.420
one day and then the sign stayed there because
we still think it's funny. When people come

00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:58.110
to the front door, they still kind of think
it's funny. We've only been burglared twice.

00:39:58.110 --> 00:40:00.200
And both times, they just walked in and pretended
they were [INDISTINCT]. A lesson to us all

00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:08.950
there. That is just a little wall when you
come in to reception. That's just stuff that

00:40:08.950 --> 00:40:16.839
people have sent us. People are always sending,
making stuff out of instant cards and sending

00:40:16.839 --> 00:40:23.740
us--there is this lady who makes us tapestries.
It just--well, sits there, makes the tapestries,

00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:28.980
every once in a while it's nice to receive
a tapestry in the post. People have decided

00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:32.200
that they really like what we do and they
really want to be involved and that's, you

00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:37.530
know, I like that. It's nice receiving a lot
of stuff. Again, it's the physical version

00:40:37.530 --> 00:40:41.760
of what people want to say and want to talk
about on the banana phones. It's just, you

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:46.990
know, people sending letter and sending ideas,
lots of ideas and new smoothie recipes, and

00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:52.960
long, it may continue, you know, one day I'd
like a whole office just to be plastered in

00:40:52.960 --> 00:41:00.330
that stuff we're working on. And that spirit
sort of openness and risking burglary extends

00:41:00.330 --> 00:41:05.760
to our AGM, which actually happens this Saturday.
So we have this thing called a grownup meeting

00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:12.579
every year where we just invite hundreds randomly
selected from a ballot Innocent drinkers and

00:41:12.579 --> 00:41:17.390
they come and spend the Saturday with us and
just tell us stuff, tell us what they think,

00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:21.970
tells us what's rubbish, because, you know,
we do those research groups and some stuff,

00:41:21.970 --> 00:41:29.470
you know, adverts and things like that. And
they always spook me a bit. You know, this

00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:33.870
research group thing I'm talking about, we
have eight people in the room, they ask probing

00:41:33.870 --> 00:41:39.130
questions and everyone kind of says what they
think they should say to make themselves look

00:41:39.130 --> 00:41:43.920
smart rather than just go [INDISTINCT]. Actually,
this is a wonderful, beautiful way of just

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:48.290
finding out what all these--what all these
people who spend their money on our drinks,

00:41:48.290 --> 00:41:53.481
things about our business and we have a [INDISTINCT]
last year doing this. You know, the founders

00:41:53.481 --> 00:41:55.809
tell people what we will be up to for the
next year, the next five years. Everyone gets

00:41:55.809 --> 00:42:00.440
to meet, everyone gets to have some tea, cake,
ask some questions, find out some new stuff.

00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:06.100
It seems like a really sensible thing to do,
and so you make sure that, you know, you've

00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:08.680
checked the building's insurance, stowed all
laptops away, our building's manager just

00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:14.730
get [INDISTINCT]. That's kind of our end.
That's the thread that runs through the book.

00:42:14.730 --> 00:42:29.730
It's telling a story of what we've done and
how we've done it. And the fact is it has

00:42:29.730 --> 00:42:32.059
been--[INDISTINCT] it has been uncomplicated,
right? It's a pretty uncomplicated product.

00:42:32.059 --> 00:42:36.010
We're relatively uncomplicated people. We
got a pretty simple idea at the beginning.

00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:42.610
We've just tried quite hard. We've been very
persistent in everything we've done. We haven't

00:42:42.610 --> 00:42:48.660
really taken no for an answer. And if you
come to our place, you're all welcome to come

00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:53.040
if one of you fancy. It still feels exactly
the same as it did 10 years ago. There's more

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:57.910
people there. There's more stuff. But I don't
know. It's quite difficult for me to describe

00:42:57.910 --> 00:43:03.400
having been there 10 years, the... It doesn't
feel any different showing up to work today

00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:09.800
as it did back then. I just got--just got
more friends. I'm just very fortunate that

00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:13.380
you'd get higher friends. And this is the
last thing I just wanted to show you, because

00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:20.849
[INDISTINCT]. It just shows the importance
of always listening to the people that...

00:43:20.849 --> 00:43:37.369
The importance of making sure you're always
listening to the customer. That's my lot.

00:43:37.369 --> 00:43:47.990
Thank you very much for listening. Thanks.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Any questions?

00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:56.309
&gt;&gt; So, Coke bought 10 to 20 percent last month,
can you talk a little bit of how you expect

00:43:56.309 --> 00:44:01.720
that to change to come to your company?
&gt;&gt; GERMAIN: Pretty much, well, the reason

00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:10.619
we chose Coke because we talked to about 18
to 25 different--well, individuals, corporations,

00:44:10.619 --> 00:44:17.020
investment groups, they were the only people
who didn't want us to do anything different.

00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:20.950
Everyone else wanted us to--have you thought
about doing this, if you thought about changing

00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:24.571
this, if you thought about moving your office
here, if you thought about having more people,

00:44:24.571 --> 00:44:29.480
less people, you know, we'd like to be involved
in that thing that part. And there people

00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:33.970
who said, "You seem to know what you're doing,
you seem to be quite good at it. Carry on."

00:44:33.970 --> 00:44:40.220
And that's--that was basically--that is the
rationale. We want--when we need more money,

00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:45.609
so when we drive in Europe we got nine offices
in Europe and now it's sold in 40 countries,

00:44:45.609 --> 00:44:49.890
but we are, you know, we are starting to spread
ourselves quite thin. And if we really want

00:44:49.890 --> 00:44:54.010
to in the next couple of years, I think, grow
probably in Europe as we have done in U.K.

00:44:54.010 --> 00:45:00.940
we just needed some capital to do that. And
Coke's people just said, great. It's an investment,

00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:06.711
right? If we get bigger, their investment
grows. They're not stupid and neither we.

00:45:06.711 --> 00:45:15.260
&gt;&gt; Talk a little bit, a bit more about your
footprint. You just mentioned that you are

00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:16.550
in 14 countries?
&gt;&gt; GERMAIN: Yes.

00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:22.299
&gt;&gt; And what are the biggest competitors, how
are you doing in those countries?

00:45:22.299 --> 00:45:27.550
&gt;&gt; GERMAIN: We're in all, all the bits of
Europe that we can kind of get to easily,

00:45:27.550 --> 00:45:32.380
because, well, we have a manufacturing hub
in Rotterdam and we have--also make lots of

00:45:32.380 --> 00:45:37.490
stuff in U.K. So, it's basically what we can
get to from those places. So about as far

00:45:37.490 --> 00:45:44.190
as we go is Finland, Austria, South of France,
and everything. I guess what we call Western

00:45:44.190 --> 00:45:50.369
Europe and Scandinavia. I guess the competition
there is Tropicana, is that Pepsi Coke? And

00:45:50.369 --> 00:45:57.220
Chiquita on mainland Europe, the big banana
company who now make [INDISTINCT]. And then,

00:45:57.220 --> 00:46:01.940
in each country you go, go to Germany, you
go to France, you go to Holland, they'll be

00:46:01.940 --> 00:46:08.980
some guys like us starting up trying to do
something new. See, we kind of--we kind of

00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:13.140
find ourselves slightly in the middle of the--the
new little guys and the big people like Pepsi

00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:17.941
coke, kind of whoever are doing it. So we
could get in that mark, but that's why we

00:46:17.941 --> 00:46:25.770
got to do it quickly, because if you don't,
there's no place for us and we won't--there

00:46:25.770 --> 00:46:33.309
will be relevance for us. So, we need to do
things now.

00:46:33.309 --> 00:46:40.630
&gt;&gt; Who you--do you have any kind of big critics
like the amount of--you all have to spend

00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:44.110
to ship all this stuff half way across the
world.

00:46:44.110 --> 00:46:47.000
&gt;&gt; GERMAIN: Yeah, oh yeah.
&gt;&gt; Who is your biggest producer?

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:53.000
&gt;&gt; GERMAIN: I guess--I don't know if there's
like a specific group of critiques. There

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:58.400
are people who drink in some drinks, who definitely
keep us on our toes. Now, we appeal to an

00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:03.390
audience with, you know, those people who
care about those issues, so if we--if they

00:47:03.390 --> 00:47:07.310
think that we're in the verge of screwing
up, they'll let us know. That's what, that's

00:47:07.310 --> 00:47:12.369
what a good insurance policy to have to know
that they care enough to tell you. I mean,

00:47:12.369 --> 00:47:17.320
we don't air freight anything. Everything
goes by land, rail, sea, so I mean you come

00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:23.400
out on massive wedge for the missions if you
don't have it right. You know, some other

00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:26.660
businesses, all the people who move food around
the world do air freight and that seems kind

00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:32.539
of crazy to us and we tried to stay as local
as possible. Mangoes, they not grow that well

00:47:32.539 --> 00:47:38.190
in the U.K., so we, you know, some stuff we
have to go and get somewhere else, but we

00:47:38.190 --> 00:47:44.049
will always be as, you know, sustainable as
we can possibly be. 2007, we launched the

00:47:44.049 --> 00:47:50.400
world's first the 100% recycled plastic bottle
to be used in a drink. Interestingly we were

00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:56.400
actually talking to Coke during the investment
process a lot. That's quite interesting to

00:47:56.400 --> 00:48:00.660
do that, you know. I wonder if we can do that.
Just tell us more about it. Now, if we can

00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:07.160
do things that make larger companies change
the way that they do business, then I'm all

00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:12.220
for continuing the way that we do business
and you know, working from within some of

00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:18.480
that is a really interesting thing [INDISTINCT]
in the future. [INDISTINCT] against no specific

00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:23.790
group of people, just good people who drink
our drinks.

00:48:23.790 --> 00:48:28.610
&gt;&gt; So, as the business grows bigger or more
on the spotlight and the--so I've heard of

00:48:28.610 --> 00:48:30.390
the exploding Smoothies.
&gt;&gt; GERMAIN: Yes.

00:48:30.390 --> 00:48:36.630
&gt;&gt; Question is, what are your biggest fears?
And is it more about customer perception?

00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:43.200
&gt;&gt; GERMAIN: Probably not the health and safety
stuff because they're the things that we can

00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:46.700
to get to quite quickly and the exploding
Smoothies stuff you referred is just if a

00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:51.470
Smoothie gets too warm, its fruit, it ferments.
We used to have these old caps that weren't

00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:55.780
so good as staying on the bottles. Now, we
have some new caps that have some kind of

00:48:55.780 --> 00:49:02.359
venting. So we sorted that one out. That's
fine. I guess my biggest fear is just about

00:49:02.359 --> 00:49:07.930
getting big and--Well, my greatest fear in
life is just getting big and old and slow,

00:49:07.930 --> 00:49:15.450
fat, you know. I don't want to be like that.
I want to retain, you know, an inquiring mind.

00:49:15.450 --> 00:49:20.402
I want our business to stay on its toes. That's
always question to things that happens. Because

00:49:20.402 --> 00:49:25.180
when you get bigger, that's when it starts.
Someone says no to you guys. Okay. I don't

00:49:25.180 --> 00:49:29.549
want to. I'd like to still be the annoying
person in the room. The same, I. Why, I got

00:49:29.549 --> 00:49:36.599
a three-year-old daughter, but she does it.
Why, why? Why, why? I just keep, you know,

00:49:36.599 --> 00:49:39.630
she never--she wants answers. You know, I'd
like our business to stay [INDISTINCT].

00:49:39.630 --> 00:49:49.570
&gt;&gt; What would you be doing if it wasn't for
Innocent?

00:49:49.570 --> 00:49:59.810
&gt;&gt; GERMAIN: Personally speaking, what would
I be doing? What would I be doing now if I

00:49:59.810 --> 00:50:03.819
haven't--if Innocent didn't happen 10 years
ago, I'd probably--I was a teacher before,

00:50:03.819 --> 00:50:15.960
I was an English teacher. So, I'd probably
be teaching. [INDISTINCT]

00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:20.380
&gt;&gt; Yeah. If you think yourself way back again
when you just started everything, how did

00:50:20.380 --> 00:50:23.280
you go about, I'm sure thinking that would
the hardest part of, you know, after you have

00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:29.750
the idea and you have your vision, how did
you go about getting funding? And how did

00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:35.809
you keep persistence in asking probably big
banks, small banks to get the funding for

00:50:35.809 --> 00:50:38.450
you?
&gt;&gt; GERMAIN: So, the persistence became very

00:50:38.450 --> 00:50:44.290
useful. At the beginning every bank that I
spoke to said no to us. Every VC, venture

00:50:44.290 --> 00:50:52.450
capital said no to us. Every individual who
had money said no to us. Everyone said no

00:50:52.450 --> 00:50:57.166
to us. So you're like three blokes who never
made a Smoothie before in your lives. You

00:50:57.166 --> 00:51:05.460
have you no experience of food and drink,
none of you. And it was only the very, very

00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:12.190
last guy after we'd sent an email to everyone
in our address books saying, "Do you know

00:51:12.190 --> 00:51:20.650
anyone rich?" in the subject line, and one
person who'd worked with John, a new guy from

00:51:20.650 --> 00:51:28.691
[INDISTINCT], American who said sometimes
invested in stuff. Crazy. I went to see Morris

00:51:28.691 --> 00:51:33.910
and he invested the first--he has 20% of the
business, roughly 20% of the business. Biggest

00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:37.580
money to [INDISTINCT]. We still see Morris.
He still sees us.

00:51:37.580 --> 00:51:49.099
&gt;&gt; That's all the time, I'm afraid. So, I'd
like to thank Dan very much once again.

00:51:49.099 --> 00:51:51.859
&gt;&gt; GERMAIN: Thank you.
END
