they mainly use the technique called

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959
they mainly use the technique called
 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.220
they mainly use the technique called
x-ray crystallography which is a way to

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230
x-ray crystallography which is a way to
 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.070
x-ray crystallography which is a way to
determine with very high precision and

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080
determine with very high precision and
 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.710
determine with very high precision and
resolution what molecules look like and

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720
resolution what molecules look like and
 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.110
resolution what molecules look like and
the ribosome after all is a molecule

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120
the ribosome after all is a molecule
 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.199
the ribosome after all is a molecule
it's an extremely complex one so it's a

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209
it's an extremely complex one so it's a
 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.720
it's an extremely complex one so it's a
very difficult problem to solve the

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730
very difficult problem to solve the
 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.550
very difficult problem to solve the

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.190
structure to understand how the atoms
are arranged in the ribosome but they

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200
are arranged in the ribosome but they
 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.840
are arranged in the ribosome but they
these real Orient's of actually solve

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850
these real Orient's of actually solve
 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.630
these real Orient's of actually solve
that problem now x-ray crystallography

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640
that problem now x-ray crystallography

you make what you basically what you do

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130
you make what you basically what you do
 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.610
you make what you basically what you do
is your purify ribosomes which in itself

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620
is your purify ribosomes which in itself
 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.400
is your purify ribosomes which in itself
isn't is an accomplishment then you have

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410
isn't is an accomplishment then you have
 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.500
isn't is an accomplishment then you have
to coax these ribosomes to form crystals

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510
to coax these ribosomes to form crystals
 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.870
to coax these ribosomes to form crystals
you know like a salt crystal but a

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880
you know like a salt crystal but a
 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.550
you know like a salt crystal but a
ribosomal crystal is much more difficult

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560
ribosomal crystal is much more difficult
 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.970
ribosomal crystal is much more difficult
to make an assault crystal and finally

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980
to make an assault crystal and finally
 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.090
to make an assault crystal and finally
you take your ribosome crystal and you

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100
you take your ribosome crystal and you
 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.330
you take your ribosome crystal and you
shine x rays onto it these x-rays will

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340
shine x rays onto it these x-rays will
 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.130
shine x rays onto it these x-rays will
scatter from the ribosomes in the

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140
scatter from the ribosomes in the
 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.020
scatter from the ribosomes in the
crystal and from the scattering pattern

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030
crystal and from the scattering pattern
 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.259
crystal and from the scattering pattern
you can if you're good enough and lucky

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269
you can if you're good enough and lucky
 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.810
you can if you're good enough and lucky
enough you can calculate what the actual

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820
enough you can calculate what the actual
 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.300
enough you can calculate what the actual
structure of the ribosome is and so how

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310
structure of the ribosome is and so how
 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.280
structure of the ribosome is and so how
difficult a task was it to be able to

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290
difficult a task was it to be able to
 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.560
difficult a task was it to be able to
get x-ray images of ribosomes so this

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570
get x-ray images of ribosomes so this

has been discussed for years in the

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:16.610
has been discussed for years in the
 

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:18.820
has been discussed for years in the
committee and we've been through every

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:18.830
committee and we've been through every
 

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:22.540

he's very important functional aspects
 

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:55.910
he's very important functional aspects
of how the ribosome actually

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:55.920
of how the ribosome actually
 

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:59.150
of how the ribosome actually
works so it's from this point of view it

00:09:59.150 --> 00:09:59.160
works so it's from this point of view it
 

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.420
