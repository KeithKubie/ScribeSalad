00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:09.400
Here you see MIT's Walter Lewin, about to
swing on a pendulum. We can write a function

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:15.440
for how the angle theta 1 depends on time,
which completely describes his motion.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.810
But what if Walter were to start swinging
from here, instead of there? We'd need a different

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.810
function, theta 2.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.650
And what if one of his students were to give
him a little push? That's rightâ€”we'd need

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.929
a third function, theta 3.

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:33.830
It would be great if we could write a single
rule, based on physical principles, that governs

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:38.840
the behavior of the pendulum. And every function
that describes pendulum motion would have

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.430
to satisfy this rule.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.470
This video will show you how to write rules
like these using the language of differential

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:47.720
equations.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.820
This video is part of the Differential Equations
video series. Laws that govern a system's

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.690
properties can be modeled using differential
equations.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:03.690
Hi, my name is Peter Dourmashkin. And I am
a senior physics lecturer at MIT.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.300
Differential equations are very important
in modeling physical phenomena. They describe

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:16.009
rules that constrain the behavior of many
complex physical and social systems.

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:21.530
Before watching this video, you should be
familiar with drawing free body force diagrams

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.310
and applying Newton's second law in polar
coordinates. You should remember how to write

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:34.299
a Taylor series expansion of a function about
a point, and understand what it means.

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:39.679
After watching this video, you should be able
to do the following 3 things:

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:43.350
Understand that the physical laws governing
a system's properties can be modeled using

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.759
differential equations,

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:51.630
Explain that the solution to a differential
equation is a family of functions,

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.490
And recognize that specifying initial conditions
determines a particular solution function

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.229
to a differential equation.

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.670
Let's see how differential equations arise
as a natural language to model the pendulum.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.819
To develop this model, we will use our knowledge
of physics.

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:17.819
First, what is a pendulum? A pendulum is typically
an object, called a bob, which hangs from

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.060
one end of a string. The other end is fixed
to a pivot point.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.580
Let's pause the video. Try to describe what
you think are the important properties of

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.380
pendulum motion.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.060
You might have said that
the behavior is periodic, that the same motion

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:47.250
repeats over and over. We say that the pendulum
exhibits oscillations, or harmonic motion.

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.660
Maybe you also noted that the motion is rotational,
moving in a circular path about the pivot

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.160
point.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:01.900
Finally, you may know that the motion eventually
stops, that is, the oscillations experience

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:08.900
a damping force. Overall we describe the motion
as "damped harmonic motion."

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:16.070
Now, let's develop a model for the pendulum.
A good first step is to choose a coordinate

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.870
system. Because the pendulum rotates about
a fixed pivot point, it makes sense to use

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:28.870
polar coordinates. Theta is the angle the
bob makes with the vertical, and r is the

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.570
distance of the bob from the pivot point.

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:38.580
Remember that when using vector in polar coordinates,
r-hat is the unit vector that points radially

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.940
outward from the pivot point, and theta-hat
is the unit vector that points perpendicular

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:49.200
to r-hat, tangential to the motion of the
pendulum.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.600
Whenever you model a system, it's important
to recognize that you are making some simplifying

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.560
assumptions. We are going to start by making
three:

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:59.600
1.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:06.600
The string has no mass.
2. The mass, m, of the bob is uniformly distributed.

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.400
3.

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.820
The string has length L and does not stretch
or shrink.

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:20.820
This means that all motion happens in the
tangential direction; none in the radial direction.

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:27.120
Now let's figure out what we need to know
to describe the motion of the pendulum.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.009
At the speeds we are dealing with, we can
ignore relativistic effects; there are no

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:38.870
electromagnetic forces, and the scale is large
enough that quantum mechanics isn't necessary.

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.650
So we'll use Newton's second law to describe
the motion of the pendulum.

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.090
What forces do you think we need to consider
in this problem?

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:59.229
Let's draw a free body diagram for an instant
where the bob is to the right of vertical,

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:01.620
and moving downwards.

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.139
There is the gravitational force acting on
the bob, due to the interaction between the

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:12.800
Earth and the bob, which points straight down
with magnitude mg. We treat this force as

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.189
acting on the center of mass of the bob.

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:21.699
The string exerts a force on the bob, which
you know as tension. We don't know what the

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:26.860
magnitude of this force is, so we'll just
write it as T, pointing inwards towards the

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.539
pivot point.

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:33.629
Finally, the motion will eventually stop,
so there must be damping forces acting on

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:39.460
the system. The damping forces are complicated.
For example, there is friction at the pivot

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:45.259
point, and air resistance on the bob. Let's
make an assumption that the damping force

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:51.830
due to friction at the pivot point is negligible
because the string is small and lubricated.

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:58.830
Then the damping force is almost entirely
from the drag due to air resistance.

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:05.259
The bob doesn't experience any drag when it
is stationary, and experiences larger amounts

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:11.569
of drag the faster it is moving. Because the
speeds of the pendulum are relatively slow,

00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:18.069
that is we do not expect there to be turbulence,
we can model the drag force as being linearly

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:24.729
proportional to velocity, and opposing the
direction of motion. Because we assume that

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:31.729
all motion occurs in tangential direction,
we can draw the damping force like so.

00:06:32.249 --> 00:06:38.809
Recall that Newton's second law is a vector
equation. Because force and acceleration are

00:06:38.809 --> 00:06:44.979
both vector quantities, we need to decompose
them into r-hat and theta-hat components.

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:51.539
Remember, acceleration can be decomposed into
two component vectors, one pointing radially

00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:57.839
inward called centripetal acceleration, and
a tangential component vector called angular

00:06:57.839 --> 00:07:04.839
acceleration. We also need to decompose our
force vectors. Notice that the tension force

00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:10.800
is already pointing radially inward, in the
negative r-hat direction. And the damping

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:16.419
force is pointing in the positive theta-hat direction,
opposite the direction of the angular velocity

00:07:16.419 --> 00:07:19.409
vector.

00:07:19.409 --> 00:07:26.120
So all we have to do is decompose the gravitational
force. We project that vector onto the r-hat

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:34.340
and theta-hat component vectors. In the r-hat
direction the magnitude is mg cos(theta) and

00:07:34.349 --> 00:07:40.770
points outwards. In the theta-hat direction,
the magnitude is mg sin(theta) and points

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:44.110
in the negative theta-hat direction.

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:49.769
Newton's second law can now be written as
two component equations. For the radial

00:07:49.769 --> 00:07:52.531
direction, we get this. 

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:54.849
And in the tangential direction,
we get this.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.960
This system of two equations has two unknowns.

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:03.000
The angle theta, and the tension.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:09.480
Remember, that we are trying to find an expression for
how the angle theta depends on time. This

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:16.490
second equation is more useful to us, because
we can express both the angular velocity and

00:08:16.779 --> 00:08:22.669
the angular acceleration in terms of theta.
Let's see how.

00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:29.660
The circular motion of the pendulum is a 1-dimensional
motion, parameterized by time t.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:37.779
The displacement of the pendulum away from center is the arc
length, which is L times theta. Because

00:08:37.779 --> 00:08:42.849
the angular velocity is tangent to the circle
of motion, it can be found simply by differentiating

00:08:42.849 --> 00:08:49.259
the displacement with respect to the parameter
t, which gives us that the angular velocity

00:08:49.259 --> 00:08:56.999
is L times the time derivative of theta. The
angular acceleration is just the time derivative

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:04.000
of the angular velocity, and is given by L
times the second time derivative of theta.

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:09.769
Observe that this works because we are only
looking for the angular velocity and angular

00:09:09.769 --> 00:09:13.750
acceleration which point tangent to our 1-dimensional
motion.

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:21.860
So now we've found expressions for the magnitudes
of the angular velocity and angular acceleration:

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:23.000
Here they are.

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:29.480
We can substitute these equations into Newton's
Second Law in the theta-hat direction; and we

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:36.480
obtain the following equation.

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:49.610
This is a second order ordinary differential
equation or 2nd order ODE.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:58.160
It is ordinary because there is only one independent variable,
time, that the angle theta depends on. It

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:03.079
is second order because the highest degree
derivative that appears in the equation is

00:10:03.079 --> 00:10:05.940
a second derivative.

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:11.639
Any function describing the pendulum motion
must satisfy this differential equation. Keep

00:10:11.639 --> 00:10:17.060
in mind that there are other forces we ignored,
such as friction at the pivot point. This

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:23.899
is a very simple but nontrivial model for
the non-linear pendulum.

00:10:23.899 --> 00:10:30.130
Notice that the first derivative term is our
velocity dependent drag force. If we decide

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:37.130
that this term is negligible, we would get
this equation.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:43.740
It is still complicated, but you might notice that it looks somewhat familiar.

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:49.149
If we assume that the displacement of the
angle is very small, we can approximate sin

00:10:49.149 --> 00:10:56.149
theta as the angle theta, which gives us this
equation.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:05.259
This is the equation of the simple harmonic oscillator. So you see that this
piece connecting the term sin theta and the

00:11:05.259 --> 00:11:11.740
second derivative of theta produces the oscillatory
behavior, and the first derivative term is

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:15.690
responsible for the damping of the motion.

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:20.500
We've seen that we can apply our knowledge
of physical laws to model a non-linear pendulum

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:22.820
with a differential equation.

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:31.680
How does this
differential equation describe the motion of a pendulum?

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:36.069
A differential equation is an equation where
the unknown element is a function, rather

00:11:36.069 --> 00:11:42.720
than a number or a single value. The differential
equation is a rule that describes how the

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:48.920
system evolves from any time t to a time t
plus Delta t.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:52.740
Where Delta t is a small time interval.

00:11:52.740 --> 00:12:00.200
 In particular, it describes the relationship between the angle theta and
its first and second derivatives as the system

00:12:00.209 --> 00:12:03.220
evolves over time.

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:08.540
Remember that to describe the motion of the
pendulum, we need an expression for the angle

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:15.209
theta as a function of time. Do you think
there is a unique solution to this differential

00:12:15.209 --> 00:12:19.569
equation? Pause the video here and discuss.

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:30.230
You probably have some sense that the motion
of the pendulum depends on how and where you

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:36.350
release itâ€”conditions we refer to as initial
conditions.

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:41.889
For example, if we barely move the pendulum
away from center, and release it from rest,

00:12:41.889 --> 00:12:48.550
the oscillation will be small. Larger displacements
will give larger oscillations, even though

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:55.129
eventually they all damp down to zero. All
of these pendulum motions satisfy the same

00:12:55.129 --> 00:12:58.069
differential equation!

00:12:58.069 --> 00:13:02.430
Since every starting position will give a
different dependence of theta on time, the

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:09.430
solution is not unique. We say that the solution
to a differential equation is an infinite

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:12.589
family of functions.

00:13:12.589 --> 00:13:17.199
But what if we were are interested in finding
one solution in particular?

00:13:17.199 --> 00:13:21.680
In the examples you just saw, we specified
the initial angle from which the pendulum

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:27.430
was released. Is this the only piece of information
we need to pick out a specific solution from

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:29.629
the infinite family?

00:13:29.629 --> 00:13:36.449
Let's test that. Here you see two identical
pendulums, each starting from the same initial

00:13:36.449 --> 00:13:40.069
angle. Are we guaranteed that the motion will
be the same?

00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:42.689
Pause the video here to make a prediction.

00:13:42.689 --> 00:13:47.049
Clearly not. What was the difference between
the initial conditions for these two pendulums?

00:13:52.629 --> 00:13:57.939
The initial angles of both pendulums were
the same. However, one was released from rest,

00:13:57.939 --> 00:14:03.529
and the other had an initial push. In other
words, the initial angular velocities were

00:14:03.529 --> 00:14:10.189
different. Remember, our differential equation
only holds after the pendulum is released

00:14:10.189 --> 00:14:14.860
because it doesn't include the action of the
pushing force.

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:20.870
Now we see the importance of specifying two
initial conditionsâ€”the initial angle and

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:26.910
the initial angular velocity. Remember, the
differential equation is the rule for how

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:32.819
the system evolves over time. In order to
solve this differential equation, we are going

00:14:32.819 --> 00:14:39.389
to use the Taylor series expansion for the
function theta about t=0.

00:14:39.389 --> 00:14:45.189
Recall that this is a polynomial series, whose
coefficients are determined by all of the

00:14:45.189 --> 00:14:52.189
derivatives of the function theta at time
t=0. So how can we find all of these derivatives

00:14:52.959 --> 00:14:55.540
of theta?

00:14:55.540 --> 00:15:01.350
Let's use the differential equation to find
the second derivative at time t=0. Notice

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:08.350
that it depends on both of our initial conditions:
initial angle and initial angular velocity.

00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:12.949
This is why we need those initial conditions.

00:15:12.949 --> 00:15:19.550
We can differentiate the differential equation
to find the third derivative at time t=0.

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:25.910
Notice again that the third derivative depends
on the initial angle, the initial angular

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:31.509
velocity, and the second derivative at time
t=0.

00:15:31.509 --> 00:15:37.850
We can continue this process and find recursive
formulas for the all of the higher order derivatives

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:46.680
of theta at time t=0! That's how the two initial
conditions allow us to pick out a solution,

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:53.680
by specifying all of the coefficients for
the Taylor series at t=0.

00:15:53.680 --> 00:16:01.399
Our Taylor series solution completely describes the function
theta. But it only works on the interval of

00:16:01.399 --> 00:16:08.399
convergence. If the series converges everywhere,
we're done! But if it doesn't converge everywhere,

00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:10.860
it must converge on some interval.

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:16.620
A differential equation determines
a specific function if we have enough pieces

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:23.449
of initial data to determine all the Taylor
coefficients for the function. In our case,

00:16:23.449 --> 00:16:28.959
with a second order ordinary differential
equation, we just needed two initial conditions.

00:16:28.959 --> 00:16:34.120
Pause the video. If you had a third order
differential equation, how many initial conditions

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:38.540
would you need to specify one solution? Pause the video.

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:46.680
That's right, three!

00:16:51.019 --> 00:16:55.439
We wanted to describe the motion of a pendulum.
We made a model, where we made

00:16:55.439 --> 00:17:01.339
some simplifying assumptions then we applied Newton's
Second Law.

00:17:01.339 --> 00:17:05.310
This gave us the differential equation, which
is the rule that angle theta

00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:09.279
and its derivatives must satisfy.

00:17:09.279 --> 00:17:15.520
We saw there is an infinite family of functions that solve our differential equation.

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:20.949
Because the differential equation was second
order, we needed 2 initial conditions to specify

00:17:20.949 --> 00:17:24.169
one unique solution.

00:17:24.169 --> 00:17:29.460
The initial conditions allowed us to determine
the coefficients of the Taylor series for

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:35.840
the angle theta as a function of time, which
solved the 
differential equation.

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:40.580
I hope you found this video helpful in understanding differential equations.

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:45.520
Now we challenge you to model other systems using differential equations.
