00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.700
- [Voiceover] What I
hope to do in this video

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:05.600
is give ourselves a more
intuitive sense of probabilities.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.200
Let's go back to an example
that we've seen before.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.434
We're rolling a fair six-sided die.

00:00:10.434 --> 00:00:12.333
There are six possibilities.

00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:15.666
We could get a one, a two, a three,

00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:19.268
a four, a five or a six.

00:00:19.268 --> 00:00:22.100
Now let's say we ask ourselves

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.800
what is the probability

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.325
of rolling a number that is

00:00:28.325 --> 00:00:32.607
less than or equal to two?

00:00:32.607 --> 00:00:34.023
What is this going to be?

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:38.067
Well, there are six equally
likely possibilities.

00:00:38.067 --> 00:00:40.133
Rolling less than or equal to two,

00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:43.253
well, that means I'm either
rolling a one or a two.

00:00:43.253 --> 00:00:46.038
So two, one, two, of the six

00:00:46.038 --> 00:00:49.400
equally likely possibilities
meet my constraints.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.667
So there is a 2/6 probability
of rolling a number

00:00:52.667 --> 00:00:54.567
less than or equal to two.

00:00:54.567 --> 00:00:56.812
Or I can just rewrite that
as an equivalent fraction.

00:00:56.812 --> 00:00:59.169
I could say there's a 1/3 probability.

00:00:59.169 --> 00:01:00.892
I could go either way.

00:01:00.892 --> 00:01:02.927
Now let's also ask
ourselves another question.

00:01:02.927 --> 00:01:07.866
What is the probability
of rolling a number

00:01:10.112 --> 00:01:13.570
greater than or equal to three?

00:01:13.586 --> 00:01:17.653
Once again, there are six
equally likely possibilities.

00:01:17.653 --> 00:01:19.319
How many of them involve rolling

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:21.066
greater than or equal to three?

00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:23.299
Let's see, one, two, three, four,

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:25.715
these possibilities right over here.

00:01:25.715 --> 00:01:28.490
Throw a three, a four, a five or six.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.300
So four out of the six
equally likely possibilities.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.902
Or I could rewrite this
as an equivalent fraction,

00:01:34.902 --> 00:01:36.933
as 2/3.

00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:38.666
So what's more likely?

00:01:38.666 --> 00:01:41.792
Rolling a number that's
less than or equal to two?

00:01:41.792 --> 00:01:44.538
Or rolling a number that's
greater than or equal to three?

00:01:44.538 --> 00:01:46.666
Well, you can see it right over here.

00:01:46.666 --> 00:01:48.867
The probability of rolling
greater than or equal to three

00:01:48.867 --> 00:01:51.266
is 2/3 while the probability
of rolling less than

00:01:51.266 --> 00:01:54.067
or equal to two is only 1/3.

00:01:54.067 --> 00:01:55.933
This number is greater.

00:01:55.933 --> 00:01:57.933
So this has a greater probability

00:01:57.933 --> 00:01:59.500
or another way of thinking about it,

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.520
rolling greater than or equal to three

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.786
is more likely than rolling
less than or equal to two.

00:02:05.786 --> 00:02:07.200
In fact, not only is it more likely,

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.984
you see that 2/3 is twice 1/3.

00:02:09.984 --> 00:02:12.433
This right over here is twice as likely.

00:02:12.433 --> 00:02:15.233
You're twice as likely to
roll a number greater than

00:02:15.233 --> 00:02:18.000
or equal to three than
you are to roll a number

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.389
less than or equal to two.

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:20.559
You can even see right over here.

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:22.366
You have twice as many possibilities

00:02:22.366 --> 00:02:26.000
of the six equally likely
ones, four versus two.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.340
Four versus two here.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.386
So you say, "Okay, I get it Sal."

00:02:30.386 --> 00:02:33.767
If the probability is a larger number,

00:02:33.767 --> 00:02:35.600
the event is more likely.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.466
It makes sense and in
this case, it's twice.

00:02:37.466 --> 00:02:40.600
The number is twice as large
so it's twice as likely.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.486
But what's the range of
possible probabilities?

00:02:44.486 --> 00:02:46.253
How low can a probability get

00:02:46.253 --> 00:02:49.100
and how high can a probability get?

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.466
Let's think about the first question.

00:02:51.466 --> 00:02:55.650
How low can a probability go?

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.200
How low, so what's the lowest probability

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.858
that you can imagine for anything?

00:03:01.858 --> 00:03:06.771
Well, let's give ourselves a
little bit of an experiment.

00:03:06.771 --> 00:03:08.604
Let's ask ourselves the probability

00:03:08.604 --> 00:03:12.469
of rolling a seven.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.076
Well, once and pause the video

00:03:15.076 --> 00:03:17.155
and try to figure it out on your own.

00:03:17.155 --> 00:03:20.013
Well, there are six equally
likely possibilities.

00:03:20.013 --> 00:03:22.523
How many of them involve rolling a seven?

00:03:22.523 --> 00:03:23.925
Well, none of them.

00:03:23.925 --> 00:03:25.600
It's impossible to roll a seven.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.385
So none of the six.

00:03:27.385 --> 00:03:30.161
We could say this probability is zero.

00:03:30.161 --> 00:03:32.233
If you see a probability of zero,

00:03:32.233 --> 00:03:34.586
someone says the probability
of that thing happening

00:03:34.586 --> 00:03:36.934
is zero, that means it's impossible.

00:03:36.934 --> 00:03:40.500
That means in no world can that happen,

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.254
if it's exactly zero.

00:03:42.254 --> 00:03:44.900
This right here, the probability is zero.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.104
That means it is impossible.

00:03:48.104 --> 00:03:51.718
It is impossible.

00:03:52.687 --> 00:03:54.900
Now how high can a probability get?

00:03:55.945 --> 00:03:59.325
How high

00:03:59.325 --> 00:04:02.107
can a probability get?

00:04:02.107 --> 00:04:03.061
Well, let's think about it.

00:04:03.061 --> 00:04:07.406
Let's say probability of rolling

00:04:07.406 --> 00:04:11.580
any number from one to six.

00:04:12.518 --> 00:04:17.162
Well, I have six equally

00:04:17.162 --> 00:04:20.176
likely possibilities
and any one of those six

00:04:20.176 --> 00:04:21.074
meets this constraint.

00:04:21.074 --> 00:04:23.511
I would have rolled a number, any number,

00:04:23.511 --> 00:04:25.961
from one to six, including one and six.

00:04:25.961 --> 00:04:29.100
So there are six equally
likely possibilities.

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.562
So the probability is one.

00:04:31.562 --> 00:04:35.396
Someone says the probability
is zero, it's impossible.

00:04:35.396 --> 00:04:37.753
If someone says the probability is one,

00:04:37.753 --> 00:04:40.513
that means it's definitely
going to happen.

00:04:46.325 --> 00:04:48.433
It's definitely going to happen.

00:04:48.433 --> 00:04:52.000
So the maximum probability
for anything is one.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.558
The minimum probability is zero.

00:04:53.558 --> 00:04:55.373
You don't have negative probabilities

00:04:55.373 --> 00:04:58.225
and you don't have
probabilities greater than one.

00:04:58.225 --> 00:04:59.528
You might be thinking, "Wait, wait.

00:04:59.528 --> 00:05:01.700
"I've seen things that they look like

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.600
"larger numbers than one."

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.381
You're probably thinking of
seeing this as a percentage.

00:05:06.381 --> 00:05:09.066
One as a percentage,
you can also write this

00:05:09.066 --> 00:05:11.356
as 100%.

00:05:11.356 --> 00:05:14.746
This right over here as
a percentage is 100%.

00:05:14.746 --> 00:05:18.373
100% is the same thing as one.

00:05:18.373 --> 00:05:20.946
You can't have a probability at 110%.

00:05:20.946 --> 00:05:25.392
110% would be the same thing as 1.1.

00:05:25.392 --> 00:05:28.703
Now this is really interesting
because you'd often see

00:05:28.703 --> 00:05:31.085
someone say, "Hey, something
for sure is going to happen

00:05:31.085 --> 00:05:32.292
"or something is impossible."

00:05:32.292 --> 00:05:34.448
But even a lot of the things
that we think for sure

00:05:34.448 --> 00:05:36.727
are going to happen,
there's some probability

00:05:36.727 --> 00:05:38.848
or some chance that they don't happen.

00:05:38.848 --> 00:05:41.074
For example, you might hear someone say,

00:05:41.074 --> 00:05:43.566
"Well, what's the probability that the sun

00:05:43.566 --> 00:05:45.900
"will rise tomorrow?"

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.833
Well, you might say it's
going to happen for sure.

00:05:48.833 --> 00:05:52.545
But you gotta remember some type of weird

00:05:52.545 --> 00:05:56.719
cosmological event might
occur, some kind of strange,

00:05:56.719 --> 00:06:01.233
huge planet-sized object
in space might come

00:06:01.233 --> 00:06:03.546
and knock the earth out of its rotation.

00:06:03.546 --> 00:06:05.492
Who knows what could happen?

00:06:05.492 --> 00:06:09.066
All these have a very low likelihood.

00:06:09.066 --> 00:06:12.066
Very, very, very, very,
very, very low likelihood.

00:06:12.066 --> 00:06:13.540
But it's hard to say it's exactly one.

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:14.938
If I had said the probability

00:06:14.938 --> 00:06:19.400
that the sun will rise

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.866
tomorrow,

00:06:22.866 --> 00:06:27.666
instead of saying one, I
would probably say it's 0.999.

00:06:27.666 --> 00:06:32.369
I would throw a lot of nines over here.

00:06:32.369 --> 00:06:35.423
I wouldn't say it's 0.9 repeating forever.

00:06:35.423 --> 00:06:38.379
Actually, there's an
interesting proof that 0.9

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:40.981
repeating forever is actually
the same thing as one,

00:06:40.981 --> 00:06:42.700
which is a little counterintuitive.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.874
But I would say there's
a very high probability.

00:06:44.874 --> 00:06:46.866
But even if it's such a high probability,

00:06:46.866 --> 00:06:48.700
it's going to be close to one.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.338
But I won't say it's exactly the one

00:06:50.338 --> 00:06:52.925
because there could be some
kind of quasar that blasts us

00:06:52.925 --> 00:06:53.719
with gamma rays.

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:56.163
Or who knows what might happen?

00:06:56.163 --> 00:06:58.446
But it's a very, very high probability.

00:06:58.446 --> 00:07:03.170
Same thing, the probability here,

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:07.243
probability that my

00:07:07.243 --> 00:07:12.243
pet gopher

00:07:14.649 --> 00:07:17.030
could write the next great novel.

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:21.353
Writes a novel.

00:07:21.353 --> 00:07:24.532
Actually not just a novel, a great novel.

00:07:24.532 --> 00:07:26.846
Just a novel wouldn't be
that impressive for a gopher.

00:07:26.846 --> 00:07:28.619
Let's say great novel.

00:07:28.619 --> 00:07:30.753
Well, once again, this
gopher sitting there

00:07:30.753 --> 00:07:32.056
typing at a keyboard.

00:07:32.056 --> 00:07:33.533
It would seem somewhat random

00:07:33.533 --> 00:07:38.074
but there is some probability
that it actually does it.

00:07:38.074 --> 00:07:39.453
There's some chance it does it.

00:07:39.453 --> 00:07:41.267
So I would put this at a very low

00:07:41.267 --> 00:07:42.900
and I wouldn't say it's exactly zero.

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.992
If we had an infinite number
of gophers doing this forever,

00:07:45.992 --> 00:07:49.323
who knows, maybe one of them
might write that great novel.

00:07:49.323 --> 00:07:51.700
In fact, if we had an infinite
number doing it forever,

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:53.800
eventually, a lot of people would say,

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.133
at some point you would.

00:07:55.133 --> 00:07:57.753
But just one gopher
trying to write a novel,

00:07:57.753 --> 00:07:59.286
what's the probability
they write a great novel?

00:07:59.286 --> 00:08:01.236
I would say it's pretty close to zero.

00:08:01.236 --> 00:08:06.202
I'd throw a lot of zeros here,

00:08:06.202 --> 00:08:08.828
and at some point you might
have something like this.

00:08:08.828 --> 00:08:12.033
Once again, not absolutely impossible

00:08:12.033 --> 00:08:14.000
but pretty close to,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.063
pretty, pretty close to impossible.

00:08:18.063 --> 00:08:19.556
So big takeaways?

00:08:19.556 --> 00:08:22.100
Higher probability, more likely.

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:24.333
The lowest probability
you can get to? Zero.

00:08:24.333 --> 00:08:26.200
Highest probability is one.

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.966
If your probability is more,

00:08:27.966 --> 00:08:30.466
when you're talking about coin flipping.

00:08:30.466 --> 00:08:34.133
If you say the probability
of heads for a fair coin

00:08:34.133 --> 00:08:35.376
and you say, "Well, that's 1/2,"

00:08:35.376 --> 00:08:37.933
that means it's equally likely
to happen or not happen.

00:08:37.933 --> 00:08:40.900
Anything that has a larger
probability than 1/2,

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:42.900
it's more likely to happen than not.

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:45.402
Anything that has a
probability of less than 1/2,

00:08:45.402 --> 00:08:48.586
it's less likely to happen than not.
