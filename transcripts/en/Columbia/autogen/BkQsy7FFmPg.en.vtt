01:18:44.010 --> 01:18:46.040 align:start position:0%
very good question and I think the fact
is<01:18:44.280><c> that</c><01:18:44.580><c> we</c><01:18:44.730><c> could</c><01:18:44.940><c> tell</c><01:18:45.240><c> where</c><01:18:45.480><c> every</c><01:18:45.780><c> case</c>

01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:46.050 align:start position:0%
is that we could tell where every case
 

01:18:46.050 --> 01:18:49.810 align:start position:0%
is that we could tell where every case

01:18:49.810 --> 01:18:49.820 align:start position:0%
was and could draw build a ring of
 

01:18:49.820 --> 01:18:53.060 align:start position:0%
was and could draw build a ring of

01:18:53.060 --> 01:18:53.070 align:start position:0%
vaccination around an immune immunity so
 

01:18:53.070 --> 01:18:55.490 align:start position:0%
vaccination around an immune immunity so
it<01:18:53.160><c> wouldn't</c><01:18:53.400><c> spread</c><01:18:53.760><c> with</c><01:18:54.600><c> a</c><01:18:54.630><c> real</c><01:18:55.050><c> advantage</c>

01:18:55.490 --> 01:18:55.500 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't spread with a real advantage
 

01:18:55.500 --> 01:18:59.960 align:start position:0%

01:19:09.390 --> 01:19:11.300 align:start position:0%

01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:19.170 align:start position:0%

01:26:58.140 --> 01:26:58.150 align:start position:0%

could<01:27:11.290><c> you</c><01:27:11.380><c> produce</c><01:27:11.590><c> some</c><01:27:11.950><c> rapidly</c><01:27:12.490><c> at</c><01:27:12.730><c> a</c>

on this they actually are producing
 

01:27:20.650 --> 01:27:22.350 align:start position:0%
on this they actually are producing

01:27:22.350 --> 01:27:22.360 align:start position:0%
