the pleasure of meeting you

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:51.330
a couple months ago--

00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:51.790

00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:52.100

00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:53.016

JAMES DRISCOLL: Napa, yeah.

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:56.841
And the first question that I
asked you when I had the chance

00:28:56.841 --> 00:28:59.120
was, of the songs that
you've written, which

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:00.680
is your personal favorite.

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:05.690
And without any hesitation, you
said "There Is So Much More."

00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:07.270
Has it changed, or
is it still that?

00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:14.080
BRETT DENNEN: That's
probably-- yes.

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:19.010
I think I'm-- I don't know
if favorite is the right way

00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:20.270
for me to describe it.

00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:27.700
I think it's the song that
I'm most pleased with myself

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:28.580
for writing.

00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:32.410
And I apologize, because
I didn't play it, but--

00:29:33.933 --> 00:29:35.516
JAMES DRISCOLL:
That's fine, but I was

00:29:35.516 --> 00:29:35.960
hoping you could talk about it.

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:38.190
BRETT DENNEN: I have--
yeah, I have-- so the song

00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:41.860
doesn't have any chorus, but I
still think it's a good song.

00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:46.160
And it's not really clear
what the song is about,

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:49.020
but I still think it's
a really good song.

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:52.340
And the song is
kind of monotonous,

00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:55.140
but it's still very
good in my opinion.

00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:58.250
And I think, for
all those reasons,

00:29:58.250 --> 00:30:03.300
I had a song without a chorus,
that is kind of sleepy,

00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:08.030
that you're not really
sure what's going on,

00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:09.590
it's about a lot of
things lyrically.

00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:12.980
But it still comes across as
a good song, and it's subtle

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:14.930
and it's simple.

00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:18.250
And as an artist,
I'm always trying

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:23.870
to find the best way to
say the most with the least

00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:27.120
amount of words and
chords and time,

00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:30.720
but still evoke some sort of
emotion and make people think.

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:34.480
And whatever it was
I was going through

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:37.640
or whatever I was
going for, I did it.

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:44.195
And it's the only time
I've done it so well.

00:30:44.195 --> 00:30:45.070
Does that make sense?

00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:46.720
JAMES DRISCOLL: Yeah.

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:47.750
BRETT DENNEN: OK.

00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:49.958
JAMES DRISCOLL: One other
thing I was thinking about.

00:30:49.958 --> 00:30:51.806
So a while back, you
toured with John Mayer.

00:30:51.806 --> 00:30:52.680
BRETT DENNEN: Uh-huh.

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:54.804
JAMES DRISCOLL: And he was
talking about your music

00:30:54.804 --> 00:30:58.960
and he said that you paint
landscapes with your music.

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:01.910
And I was thinking about that
in the context of where you

00:31:01.910 --> 00:31:03.160
are when you write your music.

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:06.030
And I know that-- I think you
retreated to the mountains

00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:08.370
to work on an album,
and now you live

00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:10.160
near the ocean in Venice Beach.

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:12.005
So how does the
landscape influence

00:31:12.005 --> 00:31:15.595
the music that you write and
the albums that you work on?

00:31:15.595 --> 00:31:16.970
BRETT DENNEN: Well
I think he was

00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:20.830
referring to just the imagery.

00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:26.140
I-- like, my favorite writers
are the ones who don't just

00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:29.630
say, like, I love you,
but they'll say I love you

00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:32.960
and this is what's happening
around me while I'm telling you

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:33.600
I love you.

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:35.970
And this is-- you know,
there's-- here are the sights

00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:37.010
and sounds and smells.

00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:40.970
And give you some sort of
imagery to help not only,

00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:43.630
like, give you something to
think about and set the mood,

00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:46.880
but also give you a
sense of place and time,

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:51.250
and even let the imagery
tell some of the story.

00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:56.750
But landscape
literally has a lot

00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:58.980
to do with the songs I write.

00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:03.810
Indirectly, just I can't-- I
have a hard time writing songs

00:32:03.810 --> 00:32:04.640
in a city.

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:06.610
I used to be able to
write songs on the road

00:32:06.610 --> 00:32:10.670
or in New York or San Francisco
or wherever with ease, just

00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:12.980
because I could tap into
the creative energy,

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:16.580
or whatever's happening in the
city that's kind of pulsating,

00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:19.520
and grab images from
what I see all around me.

00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:22.800
But it got harder and harder for
me to do that over the years,

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:25.670
and now what I need is quiet.

00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:28.260
And I need a place
like the mountains

00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:31.300
or the desert or
the ocean where it's

00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:38.610
like I'm staring out into some
form of a vast expanse which

00:32:38.610 --> 00:32:44.090
allows me to turn a little
more inside and focus.

00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:45.570
And I need quiet.

00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:49.880
And I usually need a
transitional season.

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:51.425
The list is getting longer.

00:32:51.425 --> 00:32:55.992
It's gotta be quiet,
it's gotta be beautiful,

00:32:55.992 --> 00:32:57.450
it's gotta be open,
it's gotta have

00:32:57.450 --> 00:33:02.030
some sort of strong landscape
energy, like a mountain.

00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:05.320
I have to be sad.

00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:08.360
It has to be, like, a
transitional season like autumn

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:11.010
or spring.

00:33:11.010 --> 00:33:13.790
Usually wine is involved.

00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:16.290
JAMES DRISCOLL: But do you find
if you're out in the desert,

00:33:16.290 --> 00:33:18.705
do you-- are you more likely to
write a sad song than if you're

00:33:18.705 --> 00:33:20.210
near the ocean and
you hear the waves?

00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:21.630
Then you might have a
little bit more beat.

00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:22.830
Something a little bit more--

00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:24.330
BRETT DENNEN: Yeah,
I think totally.

00:33:24.330 --> 00:33:27.260
Well I think the most
introspective songs

00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:29.250
I write come from
being in the desert.

00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:30.880
And I think being
around an ocean

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:36.060
is-- makes me-- ocean's a
different kind of energy.

00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:40.110
And there's all those ions
exploding all around me

00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:41.150
that make me feel good.

00:33:41.150 --> 00:33:45.480
So ocean, I would say, or
a river or a waterfall,

00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:48.680
would make me feel a
little more upbeat.

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:52.540
The mountains, though,
is strong kind of

00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:57.550
like we've been here
forever stoic energy

00:33:57.550 --> 00:34:01.564
that-- I don't know
what that does to me.

00:34:01.564 --> 00:34:03.730
JAMES DRISCOLL: As you were
describing those things,

00:34:03.730 --> 00:34:05.230
I got-- I don't
know about you guys,

00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:07.760
but I got all these crazy images
in my head of, like, Brett

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:13.060
playing music on top of a
mountain or in a waterfall.

00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:15.310
Like I know that doesn't
make any sense, but what does

00:34:15.310 --> 00:34:16.350
it look like when you write?

00:34:16.350 --> 00:34:18.266
Like, do you scribble
on the back of a napkin?

00:34:18.266 --> 00:34:19.600
Do you write on your phone?

00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:21.170
Are you, um, in the bathroom?

00:34:21.170 --> 00:34:22.753
BRETT DENNEN: It's
hard for me to talk

00:34:22.753 --> 00:34:30.610
about writing because sometimes
writing is just going to work,

00:34:30.610 --> 00:34:32.820
just sitting down and
forcing yourself to write.

00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:38.179
And then sometimes writing
is catching inspiration like

00:34:38.179 --> 00:34:42.190
it's some kind of a unicorn or
something that you don't really

00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:44.010
believe in, but you
don't-- it's here,

00:34:44.010 --> 00:34:48.040
all of a sudden it's here
and you're really inspired.

00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:51.699
And you're just trying to
capture the moment with a net

00:34:51.699 --> 00:34:53.139
or something like that.

00:34:53.139 --> 00:34:56.679
Or the net being whatever
tools-- whatever chords

00:34:56.679 --> 00:34:58.396
you know or words you know.

00:35:01.518 --> 00:35:06.510
Sometimes songs come from
just months and months

00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:10.640
of writing on a
computer, a laptop,

00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:12.877
or scribbling down
lyrics and poems

00:35:12.877 --> 00:35:14.710
and trying to find a
way to put it to music.

00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:18.560
Sometimes song-- like you're
messing around on a guitar

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:20.900
and you have a
progression or a melody,

00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:24.270
and you're like what sort
of words go with this.

00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:26.540
And sometimes you
put the two together.

00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:28.180
Sometimes you slave over it.

00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:30.770
Sometimes it comes like that.

00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:32.460
You never really know.

00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:37.890
That's why people
who know me and know

00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:40.890
that when I have to write, I
disappear for a while because I

00:35:40.890 --> 00:35:44.840
torture myself a
little bit, a lot.

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:46.940
And I don't feel good about
myself unless I write.

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:55.105
It's not healthy,
but it works for me.

00:35:55.105 --> 00:35:56.980
JAMES DRISCOLL: I'm glad
you brought that up,

00:35:56.980 --> 00:35:59.587
because we were talking before
your performance about what

00:35:59.587 --> 00:36:01.920
you're working on right now
and where you are right now.

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:04.530
And I think there's an
album coming out in May?

00:36:04.530 --> 00:36:05.280
BRETT DENNEN: Yes.

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:07.780
JAMES DRISCOLL: That I think
we're all pretty excited about.

00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:09.100
But you're still working on it.

00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:10.990
And you said that you've
finished with the recordings,

00:36:10.990 --> 00:36:13.320
but there are songs that
are going to have to be cut

00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:15.840
and there are songs that are
gonna have to be re-ordered.

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:17.590
Can you talk about
where you are right now

00:36:17.590 --> 00:36:19.420
in terms of your work?

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:20.920
BRETT DENNEN: The
album is finished.

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:25.160
We're-- the recording is done,
and I'm pretty happy with it.

00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:29.890
I think it's, for who I am
as a person and an artist

00:36:29.890 --> 00:36:32.590
and my process and the
craft that I've developed

00:36:32.590 --> 00:36:36.450
as a writer and the
things that I want to say,

00:36:36.450 --> 00:36:40.940
I feel very confident
in what I've done.

00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:46.160
We're just figuring
out how to release it.

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:48.810
And that could be
the marketing, that

00:36:48.810 --> 00:36:56.220
could be the album
packaging isn't done yet.

00:36:56.220 --> 00:37:01.090
You know, when you put-- it's--
the way the industry is now is

00:37:01.090 --> 00:37:04.810
artists like myself, we put
albums out every three, two,

00:37:04.810 --> 00:37:07.180
sometimes four to five years.

00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:09.990
So you really have to go
in with a lot of confidence

00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:13.190
when you're putting it out
there, and stand behind it.

00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:17.950
And we're just trying to figure
out the best way to do that,

00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:19.575
because I really want
people to hear it

00:37:19.575 --> 00:37:23.830
and I want it to get noticed
and I want to engage my fans,

00:37:23.830 --> 00:37:26.760
but I also want to
reach out to new people.

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:31.319
And so it may sound easy,
like oh, you just put it out

00:37:31.319 --> 00:37:33.110
and you sing your heart
out and it's great,

00:37:33.110 --> 00:37:35.620
but there's like
all kinds of things

00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:38.930
that you have to consider,
like what's the label releasing

00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:39.680
at that time.

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:41.560
Is there gonna be
competition with this.

00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:43.020
When should we tour.

00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:46.740
How, like, what's-- so that's
what we're figuring out,

00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:48.790
that boring stuff.

00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:51.180
JAMES DRISCOLL: So
boring stuff aside, I'm

00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:53.305
curious about your
intention, like specifically

00:37:53.305 --> 00:37:56.150
if there's one intention that
you have when you play music,

00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:59.635
and especially when you
share it at a concert.

00:37:59.635 --> 00:38:01.760
Your shows can create a
really intimate environment

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:02.840
with the audience.

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:04.172
And so I'm wondering, from
your perspective-- I'm sure

00:38:04.172 --> 00:38:06.588
you have several intentions,
but what's the one overriding

00:38:06.588 --> 00:38:10.150
intention that you have when you
share your music with people?

00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:11.160
When you play at a show?

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:13.630
BRETT DENNEN: It's
just, simply put,

00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:16.020
I want to make people feel good.

00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:17.960
The way I want to
make them feel good

00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:23.040
is I want to be open and
vulnerable and sensitive

00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:26.780
in the songs I write and
the way that I play them.

00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:32.120
And I hope that it
allows people to hear

00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:36.730
the song with an
open heart and feel,

00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:39.100
maybe go through some emotions
at the end of the concert

00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:44.360
or at the end of the album,
come out of it feeling good.

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:47.250
I may be dreaming,
but I would really

00:38:47.250 --> 00:38:50.882
love if people tapped
into their own--

00:38:50.882 --> 00:38:52.590
whatever they're going
through, their own

00:38:52.590 --> 00:38:55.550
struggles, and feel
good about themselves,

00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:58.380
beyond just feeling good.

00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:03.706
I want to give people hope
and make them cry and dance

00:39:03.706 --> 00:39:07.330
and just feel good about life.

00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:09.580
Comfortable with themselves.

00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:11.730
Because those are all
things that I struggle with,

00:39:11.730 --> 00:39:18.660
and sometimes I want to make
a sad song or a sad album

00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:20.560
or an angry song
or an angry album,

00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:24.180
but I can't-- it never seems
to happen because I want to put

00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:26.690
something positive out.

00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:29.930
Even if it comes from
a place of sadness,

00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:31.930
I just want to,
simply put again,

00:39:31.930 --> 00:39:33.310
to make people feel good.

00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:37.500
And feel like they're on drugs.

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:39.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:39.530 --> 00:39:41.262
JAMES DRISCOLL: The
legal ones, right?

00:39:41.262 --> 00:39:43.070
Um, thinking about that.

00:39:43.070 --> 00:39:44.625
So--

00:39:44.625 --> 00:39:46.410
BRETT DENNEN: By
acting like I'm stoned,

00:39:46.410 --> 00:39:49.450
then I make people,
like, feel high.

00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:51.200
JAMES DRISCOLL: You
did drink a lot of tea

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:51.950
before the performance.

00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:52.350
BRETT DENNEN: I did.

00:39:52.350 --> 00:39:53.030
I was dragging.

00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:53.900
JAMES DRISCOLL:
About like four cups.

00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:55.733
BRETT DENNEN: It's gonna
kick in any minute.

00:39:57.742 --> 00:39:59.200
JAMES DRISCOLL:
Well I also noticed

00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:00.783
that it seems like
a lot of your songs

00:40:00.783 --> 00:40:04.970
are about heartbreak and
the healing afterwards.

00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:08.782
And I was kind of wondering
about that in terms of,

00:40:08.782 --> 00:40:10.770
like, what are
the saddest lyrics

00:40:10.770 --> 00:40:12.020
you think you've ever written?

00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:17.660
BRETT DENNEN: I've written a
lot about death and loss, that

00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:18.450
is for sure.

00:40:18.450 --> 00:40:22.640
And then heartbreak
romantically,

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:25.740
and just through
letting go and change,

00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:28.959
and just the different
waves and ripples and things

00:40:28.959 --> 00:40:30.375
in life that are
hard to navigate.

00:40:32.202 --> 00:40:33.785
JAMES DRISCOLL: Is
there a single line

00:40:33.785 --> 00:40:35.150
that, when you sing it,
it breaks your heart

00:40:35.150 --> 00:40:36.150
a little bit every time?

00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:40.070
You guys know his music.

00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:43.630
There's a lot of
heartbreak in it.

00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:45.590
AUDIENCE: He's having
an Oprah moment.

00:40:45.590 --> 00:40:48.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:52.324
BRETT DENNEN: Well I'd
have to think about it.

00:40:52.324 --> 00:40:53.740
JAMES DRISCOLL:
Or how about this.

00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:56.822
Is there a line that always
brings you a lot of happiness,

00:40:56.822 --> 00:40:58.280
that's always
positive, that always

00:40:58.280 --> 00:40:59.446
resonates with the audience?

00:41:01.529 --> 00:41:02.320
BRETT DENNEN: Yeah.

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:04.990
Well one of the songs
I played recent-- here,

00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:07.174
when I was over
there, was a song

00:41:07.174 --> 00:41:08.340
called "When We Were Young."

00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:10.670
And there's a line in
there about high school

00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:12.810
being a failure factory.

00:41:12.810 --> 00:41:14.557
And I don't do it
that often, but that's

00:41:14.557 --> 00:41:16.640
like-- makes me feel good,
because I feel like I'm

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:18.373
sticking it to somebody.

00:41:18.373 --> 00:41:19.180
You know?

00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:22.460
And then I also feel that
most people can relate

00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:24.110
to that in one way or another.

00:41:24.110 --> 00:41:25.570
It might not have
been high school,

00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:29.960
but maybe like on a
social economic level

00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:34.140
they could be like yes, high
schools are failure factories.

00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:34.920
He is right.

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:39.890
Or they can be like yeah, nobody
understood me in high school.

00:41:39.890 --> 00:41:41.020
I like singing that one.

00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:42.756
That's the one that
makes me feel good.

00:41:42.756 --> 00:41:43.800
JAMES DRISCOLL: OK.

00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:44.300
Cool.

00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:45.899
I only have a couple
more questions,

00:41:45.899 --> 00:41:47.690
but we do have a mic
for audience questions

00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:50.362
if there's anything that
you wanted to ask Brett.

00:41:50.362 --> 00:41:52.300
But the first of two
questions I have for you,

00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:55.250
so this is really random and
awkward-- I apologize ahead

00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:58.120
of time-- but you have
a line that I really

00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:00.120
like in the song "Who
Do You Think You Are."

00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:02.690
I think it's "there's a homeless
man sleeping in the parking

00:42:02.690 --> 00:42:03.190
lot.

00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:05.170
I wonder what he dreams about."

00:42:05.170 --> 00:42:08.210
And so I'm wondering,
you're a musician,

00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:11.710
do musicians hear
music in their dreams?

00:42:11.710 --> 00:42:13.472
BRETT DENNEN: Yes.

00:42:13.472 --> 00:42:16.180
JAMES DRISCOLL: Could
I get some of that?

00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:18.430
BRETT DENNEN: You want some
of my dreaming music, or--

00:42:18.430 --> 00:42:20.596
JAMES DRISCOLL: I don't
have any music in my dreams.

00:42:20.596 --> 00:42:23.370
And I think if I had music in my
dreams, they'd be a lot better.

00:42:23.370 --> 00:42:25.200
BRETT DENNEN: You never
hear music in your dreams?

00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:26.866
JAMES DRISCOLL: No,
I've been trying to.

00:42:26.866 --> 00:42:29.440
BRETT DENNEN: Even like
a song that you know,

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:31.274
like "Going To The Chapel"?

00:42:31.274 --> 00:42:32.857
I don't know why I
said that one, but.

00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:39.310
That never come-- like a
song that you know and love,

00:42:39.310 --> 00:42:39.900
like if you--

00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:40.700
JAMES DRISCOLL: I
would love that.

00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:41.600
BRETT DENNEN: It's
never happened.

00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:41.900
JAMES DRISCOLL: No.

00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:42.650
BRETT DENNEN: Wow.

00:42:42.650 --> 00:42:43.977
Do you see colors?

00:42:43.977 --> 00:42:45.185
JAMES DRISCOLL: I don't know.

00:42:45.185 --> 00:42:46.887
BRETT DENNEN: Do you smell?

00:42:46.887 --> 00:42:47.970
JAMES DRISCOLL: I hope so.

00:42:47.970 --> 00:42:48.980
BRETT DENNEN: You fly?

00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:49.813
JAMES DRISCOLL: Yes.

00:42:54.515 --> 00:42:56.890
BRETT DENNEN: Do other people
hear music in their dreams?

00:42:56.890 --> 00:42:58.060
Yeah.

00:42:58.060 --> 00:42:59.440
JAMES DRISCOLL: He's a musician.

00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:01.400
BRETT DENNEN: And you've
come-- you've heard something

00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:03.770
that you wrote in a dream,
and you woke up and found it

00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:05.140
on whatever instrument you play?

00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:05.420
AUDIENCE: Absolutely.

00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:06.510
BRETT DENNEN: Yeah.

00:43:06.510 --> 00:43:10.800
It's-- I don't know what it is,
but I know when you play music

00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:14.340
you're constantly creating
pathways in your brain

00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:15.160
for melodies.

00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:17.260
And melodies are
everywhere, too.

00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:20.480
I mean, I may come up with
some brilliant melody,

00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:22.760
and then realize
that it's not mine,

00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:25.380
it's in a thousand other
songs and it's not--

00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:28.250
it may still be brilliant,
but I didn't come up with it.

00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:30.300
Melodies, they're already
in our subconscious.

00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:31.930
They're all around us.

00:43:31.930 --> 00:43:35.190
And dreaming definitely
taps into everything

00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:39.604
that's around us that we're not
aware of, especially emotions,

00:43:39.604 --> 00:43:41.020
things that we
didn't know-- don't

00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:43.930
know that we are
feeling or haven't felt

00:43:43.930 --> 00:43:47.910
or are ignoring or repressing.

00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:52.716
But I don't remember
my dreams that much.

00:43:52.716 --> 00:43:55.132
JAMES DRISCOLL: But you remember
that there's music in it.

00:43:55.132 --> 00:43:55.604
BRETT DENNEN: Yeah.

00:43:55.604 --> 00:43:57.020
JAMES DRISCOLL: That's cool.

00:43:57.020 --> 00:43:59.910
BRETT DENNEN: Well,
yeah, sometimes.

00:43:59.910 --> 00:44:02.780
Sometimes I'll wake up
with a melody in my head

00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:04.700
that came from a dream.

00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:06.270
And I'll turn it into something.

00:44:06.270 --> 00:44:09.330
Actually it happened in a song
I wrote for this new record,

00:44:09.330 --> 00:44:12.490
but it didn't make
it on the new record.

00:44:12.490 --> 00:44:14.410
So it's an endless--
it's a pointless story.

00:44:19.170 --> 00:44:20.670
JAMES DRISCOLL: So
the last question

00:44:20.670 --> 00:44:26.260
that I had has to do with partly
how you came to be here today.

00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:26.760
So you--

00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:27.620
BRETT DENNEN: Wine.

00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:28.494
JAMES DRISCOLL: Wine?

00:44:28.494 --> 00:44:29.510
Yeah.

00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:33.625
Your business partner, Ian,
was interested in promoting

00:44:33.625 --> 00:44:34.327
the new label.

00:44:34.327 --> 00:44:36.660
Beautiful label, I know that
you did the artwork for it.

00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:40.104
And it's a delicious wine,
too-- Charismatic Fool.

00:44:40.104 --> 00:44:42.020
And so Ian wanted to
have a wine tasting here,

00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:45.330
and I thought yeah, that sounds
great, but can Brett come

00:44:45.330 --> 00:44:48.120
and can he bring his guitar
and can he play and talk

00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:51.100
and can we get everything
out of him that we could.

00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:52.714
So hopefully we have.

00:44:52.714 --> 00:44:53.880
BRETT DENNEN: What'd he say?

00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:55.057
Yes or no?

00:44:55.057 --> 00:44:56.140
JAMES DRISCOLL: Yeah, he--

00:44:56.140 --> 00:44:58.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:00.317
You're here, so
it all worked out.

00:45:00.317 --> 00:45:01.650
But wine-making was interesting.

00:45:01.650 --> 00:45:03.191
So you're accomplished
as a musician,

00:45:03.191 --> 00:45:04.570
you're accomplished
as a painter,

00:45:04.570 --> 00:45:06.360
and now you're making wine.

00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:09.060
How did that happen,
and how's it going?

00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:12.840
BRETT DENNEN: Well my
friends Ian and Steve have

00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:18.390
a business where they get
artists such as myself who they

00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:23.920
think have somewhat of-- some
sort of lifestyle brands,

00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:27.180
but also have a love of wine
and an interest in making wine.

00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:29.040
Because I don't know
how to make wine.

00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:32.260
I'm learning through them.

00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:36.010
And so we get together and we
talk and we dream up an idea

00:45:36.010 --> 00:45:38.440
and they say, like, if you
were going to make a wine,

00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:39.360
what would it be?

00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:40.940
And I say, a rose.

00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:43.252
And they say, huh, OK.

00:45:43.252 --> 00:45:44.710
How are we going
to make this work?

00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:45.930
What about a sparkling rose?

00:45:45.930 --> 00:45:47.800
And then we start tasting wine.

00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:50.890
And they work with
an actual winemaker,

00:45:50.890 --> 00:45:55.830
and they buy grapes or juice,
and everybody gets involved.

00:45:55.830 --> 00:46:00.140
And I just paint the label
and drink a lot a wine.

00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:08.230
And it's a
collaborative process,

00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:13.980
but that I can't take credit
for other than the fact

00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:19.230
that I feel like
it's collaborative,

00:46:19.230 --> 00:46:23.576
but the wine comes
out tasting like me.

00:46:23.576 --> 00:46:27.007
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:27.007 --> 00:46:28.590
JAMES DRISCOLL: Can
you describe that?

00:46:28.590 --> 00:46:29.390
What do you taste like?

00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:29.730
AUDIENCE: Rose.

00:46:29.730 --> 00:46:30.980
BRETT DENNEN: Well, it's rose.

00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:33.910
It looks-- it's the
same color as my hair.

00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:40.270
And it's elegant and
graceful, but most of the time

00:46:40.270 --> 00:46:46.120
it's bubbly and-- it's
all about celebrating,

00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:52.980
but it has its moments
of being graceful.

00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:55.820
We went down this
road with a sparkling

00:46:55.820 --> 00:46:59.100
rose because we wanted a wine
that was all about celebration,

00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:01.340
but we wanted to make it
very approachable and easy

00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:04.170
drinking so that every day
could be a celebration.

00:47:04.170 --> 00:47:06.580
You don't have to wait until
New Year's or your birthday

00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:08.710
or whatever.

00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:11.120
It's at a price point
that's affordable so

00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:14.730
that you could just make
tonight or today or this morning

00:47:14.730 --> 00:47:17.850
or whenever, the
bathtub or the shower,

00:47:17.850 --> 00:47:20.790
a celebration, and just
feel good about-- again,

00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:23.669
feel good about life.

00:47:23.669 --> 00:47:26.210
JAMES DRISCOLL: Well you being
here I think makes a lot of us

00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:26.970
feel pretty good about life.

00:47:26.970 --> 00:47:28.450
So thanks for that performance.

00:47:28.450 --> 00:47:29.240
BRETT DENNEN: Yes.

00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:31.281
JAMES DRISCOLL: Are there
any audience questions?

00:47:31.281 --> 00:47:32.540
BRETT DENNEN: You're welcome.

00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:34.230
JAMES DRISCOLL: I think there's
a microphone, too, running

00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:35.190
around.

00:47:35.190 --> 00:47:37.170
BRETT DENNEN: Ooh.

00:47:37.170 --> 00:47:38.295
Attached to a person.

00:47:41.730 --> 00:47:44.330
AUDIENCE: Thanks so
much for coming, Brett.

00:47:44.330 --> 00:47:47.290
You described how you
want, in your shows,

00:47:47.290 --> 00:47:50.030
you want your audience to feel
good not just in the moment,

00:47:50.030 --> 00:47:52.754
but feel good about
themselves from the audience

00:47:52.754 --> 00:47:54.920
that you bring to them--
or sorry, from the attitude

00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:58.800
that you bring to them, which is
an attitude of, like, silliness

00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:00.027
and vulnerability.

00:48:00.027 --> 00:48:01.610
How would you said
that attitude helps

00:48:01.610 --> 00:48:04.240
them really understand
and makes them feel good

00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:05.080
about themselves?

00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:06.871
BRETT DENNEN: Well
thank you, first of all,

00:48:06.871 --> 00:48:09.840
for saying it much better
than I attempted to say it.

00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:11.090
That is exactly it.

00:48:11.090 --> 00:48:14.630
Silliness, vulnerable, openness.

00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:16.390
I think like when--
I didn't do it today,

00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:21.430
but normally when I perform
with a band, usually always,

00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:24.000
solo acoustic as well,
I don't wear shoes

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.395
just because I feel more
comfortable barefoot.

00:48:26.395 --> 00:48:27.770
So then everybody
here is staring

00:48:27.770 --> 00:48:32.860
at my feet, which, you
know, I'm not a foot model

00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:35.170
or anything like that.

00:48:35.170 --> 00:48:43.120
So here's this tall guy with
red hair who's kind of awkward.

00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:46.060
And I dance, and my dance
moves are kind of awkward.

00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:48.270
But I'm just trying
to tap into-- I'm

00:48:48.270 --> 00:48:52.500
doing it because I'm trying
to, like, harness my inner joy.

00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:54.900
I'm just trying to tap into
something to get into it,

00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:57.210
to play, to feel and
go to another place

00:48:57.210 --> 00:49:01.420
where I'm really not aware of
what is happening with my body.

00:49:01.420 --> 00:49:03.550
And I hope that
people look at that

00:49:03.550 --> 00:49:06.340
and they see oh,
here's a guy believing

00:49:06.340 --> 00:49:07.900
himself-- believing in himself.

00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:10.150
He's not-- he doesn't
look like the people

00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:11.140
you hear on the radio.

00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:14.030
He doesn't sound like the
people you hear on the radio.

00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:15.990
But he's up there having
the time of his life

00:49:15.990 --> 00:49:18.590
and he's playing good
music and he's singing--

00:49:18.590 --> 00:49:19.805
he's tapping into something.

00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:27.005
That hopefully makes them
feel good about their own skin

00:49:27.005 --> 00:49:29.890
and situation and set of
circumstances, at least

00:49:29.890 --> 00:49:32.510
in the moment, and they
can just-- we can all just

00:49:32.510 --> 00:49:35.660
have a great time together and
I can feed off of their energy.

00:49:35.660 --> 00:49:41.620
And then when they walk
out, they can feel good.

00:49:49.236 --> 00:49:50.440
AUDIENCE: Hey there.

00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:56.490
So I guess music is an
avenue towards, like,

00:49:56.490 --> 00:50:01.480
coming out on the other end with
more clarity, in some sense.

00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:03.830
And then I guess the question
would be, do you agree?

00:50:03.830 --> 00:50:06.275
And if so, what have you
learned about yourself?

00:50:11.810 --> 00:50:14.240
BRETT DENNEN: It's a
good point to make,

00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:18.210
that you may be-- I may be
going through something,

00:50:18.210 --> 00:50:21.810
and I write to try to figure out
what it is I'm going through.

00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:28.590
What have I learned about
myself, what sort of clarity

00:50:28.590 --> 00:50:31.170
have I gained?

00:50:31.170 --> 00:50:35.790
With this most recent
record that I've

00:50:35.790 --> 00:50:39.390
made that's yet
to come out, I've

00:50:39.390 --> 00:50:46.340
learned that I'm a lot more
sensitive and emotional than I

00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:47.005
thought I was.

00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:55.760
And the songs that I wrote
for this record came at a time

00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:59.410
when I didn't have
a lot of confidence.

00:50:59.410 --> 00:51:02.660
And I think it just--
a lot of things,

00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:06.110
just where I am in life,
being in my mid-thirties,

00:51:06.110 --> 00:51:10.090
where I am in my career,
like wanting more and wanting

00:51:10.090 --> 00:51:14.180
to branch-- artistically
wanting to expand.

00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:21.930
And I'm always trying to
push myself artistically

00:51:21.930 --> 00:51:24.105
to some new territory.

00:51:24.105 --> 00:51:25.890
I don't know what it
is or where it is,

00:51:25.890 --> 00:51:28.230
but to feel like I'm,
like, onto something,

00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:30.314
or like at least
something new for me.

00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:38.070
And if I'm not feeling
that way, I'm uninspired,

00:51:38.070 --> 00:51:46.320
and I'm learning that I
need to write all the time.

00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:48.050
I need to be productive
as an artist.

00:51:48.050 --> 00:51:52.450
But I also need to take
care of myself as a person,

00:51:52.450 --> 00:51:55.030
emotionally.

00:51:55.030 --> 00:52:00.930
That's all I've really learned
with-- so far with this record.

00:52:00.930 --> 00:52:02.890
Just things about
myself, I guess.

00:52:02.890 --> 00:52:08.530
And I'm lucky to do
it in a fashion that

00:52:08.530 --> 00:52:15.160
allows me to have a
career and do what I love.

00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:16.480
And hopefully people relate.

00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:21.138
Yeah?

00:52:21.138 --> 00:52:24.670
Oh yeah, you need it,
because we're broadcasting.

00:52:24.670 --> 00:52:26.390
AUDIENCE: Hi, Brett.

00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:29.340
I just wanted to know more,
like, superficial question.

00:52:29.340 --> 00:52:31.360
I know you're from
San Francisco,

00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:33.280
and I was surprised
that you moved

00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:35.950
to LA, or to Venice Beach.

00:52:35.950 --> 00:52:38.300
BRETT DENNEN: I'm actually
from Oakdale, which

00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:41.090
is a couple hours from here.

00:52:41.090 --> 00:52:43.840
But if we wanted to see
a concert or something,

00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:47.090
we'd come to San Francisco.

00:52:47.090 --> 00:52:49.180
And I don't know
if you want to get

00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:52.590
me started on that second
half of the question,

00:52:52.590 --> 00:52:59.720
because I have this theory
that, like, the north just

00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:02.700
always hates on the south.

00:53:02.700 --> 00:53:06.550
It's like people in LA
think people in San Diego

00:53:06.550 --> 00:53:10.430
are the worst, and then
people in San Francisco

00:53:10.430 --> 00:53:12.140
think people in
LA are the worst.

00:53:12.140 --> 00:53:14.769
And people in Portland think
that San Francisco-- I don't

00:53:14.769 --> 00:53:16.060
know, maybe I'm making this up.

00:53:16.060 --> 00:53:16.580
AUDIENCE: Is it better,
like, creatively?

00:53:16.580 --> 00:53:19.320
BRETT DENNEN: But
from what I've noticed

00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:21.970
from spending a lot of
time in the Bay Area

00:53:21.970 --> 00:53:27.470
and from spending a lot
of time in Los Angeles

00:53:27.470 --> 00:53:30.700
is people in the Bay Area
always say LA is so this, that.

00:53:30.700 --> 00:53:32.590
The people are so
this, that, and that.

00:53:32.590 --> 00:53:34.720
And then people in
Los Angeles just say,

00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:35.720
it's just cold up there.

00:53:39.390 --> 00:53:42.340
There's a lot of good
people in Los Angeles,

00:53:42.340 --> 00:53:46.195
and it's one of the most
vibrant cities we have.

00:53:49.390 --> 00:53:52.930
And I don't-- I mean, I
don't want to try to convince

00:53:52.930 --> 00:53:55.610
everybody that-- I'm
not an ambassador to LA,

00:53:55.610 --> 00:54:01.930
but I moved down there to try
to make something happen with

00:54:01.930 --> 00:54:03.160
music.

00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:04.720
And it did.

00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:06.820
And I might have been
able to do that up here.

00:54:06.820 --> 00:54:09.260
I might have been able to do
it in Nashville or New York.

00:54:09.260 --> 00:54:18.110
But LA has an amazing
mix of culture.

00:54:18.110 --> 00:54:19.530
And the weather's incredible.

00:54:19.530 --> 00:54:21.215
And the ocean is beautiful.

00:54:21.215 --> 00:54:29.410
And all my favorite
music, most of it

00:54:29.410 --> 00:54:31.490
came out of Los
Angeles in the '70s.

00:54:31.490 --> 00:54:36.826
And I wanted to see if I
could have a part of that.

00:54:36.826 --> 00:54:38.617
JAMES DRISCOLL: What
is some of that music?

00:54:38.617 --> 00:54:40.805
The Doors?

00:54:40.805 --> 00:54:42.930
BRETT DENNEN: The Doors
I'm starting to appreciate.

00:54:42.930 --> 00:54:47.120
But I love, like,
Crosby, Stills and Nash.

00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:50.435
That's one of the-- and
like that whole scene.

00:54:50.435 --> 00:54:55.570
The Eagles and Jackson
Browne and-- there's

00:54:55.570 --> 00:54:59.685
different areas in music that
are just completely golden,

00:54:59.685 --> 00:55:03.410
and different scenes come
from different towns.

00:55:03.410 --> 00:55:06.890
Like you have the British,
like the London in the '60s was

00:55:06.890 --> 00:55:07.800
that was it.

00:55:10.790 --> 00:55:13.610
And LA in the early
'70s, that was

00:55:13.610 --> 00:55:17.430
a special moment in
music that is probably

00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:20.056
my favorite era of music.

00:55:24.122 --> 00:55:25.580
AUDIENCE: Thank
you for being here.

00:55:25.580 --> 00:55:27.300
First of all, go Banana Slugs.

00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:28.300
BRETT DENNEN: All right.

00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:30.680
AUDIENCE: My
question is, did you

00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:34.140
have a moment or a pivotal point
in your career or your journey

00:55:34.140 --> 00:55:36.300
where you were at a
crossroads and you,

00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:39.430
like, didn't know to keep
going or do something else?

00:55:39.430 --> 00:55:41.820
And if you were,
like, how did you

00:55:41.820 --> 00:55:44.990
make the decision to continue
down the path of music?

00:55:47.702 --> 00:55:49.410
BRETT DENNEN: I had
one of those recently

00:55:49.410 --> 00:55:52.160
when I was-- right before
I was writing this album.

00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:54.950
I just felt a little
tapped out and uninspired.

00:55:54.950 --> 00:55:57.750
And I was going through
a lot personally.

00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:02.930
My girlfriend and I sort
of, like, took a break,

00:56:02.930 --> 00:56:06.590
and I felt like taking
a break from music.

00:56:06.590 --> 00:56:12.760
But I didn't tell anybody about
it because I felt pressure

00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:15.550
because I'm on a
major label now and I

00:56:15.550 --> 00:56:18.510
wanted to produce for them
and make everybody happy.

00:56:18.510 --> 00:56:21.510
And so I didn't
really deal with it,

00:56:21.510 --> 00:56:25.390
I just told everybody
I have some songs.

00:56:25.390 --> 00:56:27.700
They're almost done.

00:56:27.700 --> 00:56:33.010
And then I just--
I've somehow I worked

00:56:33.010 --> 00:56:36.892
through it, just by spending
a lot of time alone writing,

00:56:36.892 --> 00:56:37.850
being in the mountains.

00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:46.260
When I first started writing
songs, I wasn't-- like,

00:56:46.260 --> 00:56:51.950
I was trying to figure out life
by working at a-- I would work

00:56:51.950 --> 00:56:55.125
at a summer camp, and then
in the spring and the fall

00:56:55.125 --> 00:57:00.010
I'd work at another camp, like
an outdoor ed camp up here.

00:57:00.010 --> 00:57:03.029
And then I'd have
big gaps of time

00:57:03.029 --> 00:57:04.320
where I didn't know what to do.

00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:06.890
I'd go move back
in with my parents.

00:57:06.890 --> 00:57:10.280
And when I'd write songs
at that period in my life,

00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:13.222
for my first record, it
was kind of like music--

00:57:13.222 --> 00:57:14.930
I didn't know anything
about the industry

00:57:14.930 --> 00:57:18.800
or what it was like
to be a musician,

00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:21.550
I just wanted to be
in the band that I

00:57:21.550 --> 00:57:27.320
saw at the local club
that seats 300 people.

00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:29.930
I was like, if I could be
that, that's-- I'm set.

00:57:29.930 --> 00:57:31.780
I made it.

00:57:31.780 --> 00:57:35.620
And so I was writing
songs dreaming of that.

00:57:35.620 --> 00:57:42.260
And every time I wrote a song,
it was a thrilling experience

00:57:42.260 --> 00:57:47.550
because I'm introducing
myself through music.

00:57:47.550 --> 00:57:53.320
And then you start
to do it full-time,

00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:56.390
and sometimes
inspiration runs out

00:57:56.390 --> 00:58:00.060
and you have to find new ways
to say what you said before

00:58:00.060 --> 00:58:02.010
or go down new avenues.

00:58:02.010 --> 00:58:05.910
And it's tough to keep it going.

00:58:05.910 --> 00:58:08.800
And sometimes, if you
don't feel inspired

00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:13.470
and what you have to do
requires inspiration,

00:58:13.470 --> 00:58:16.680
it's hard to separate
yourself from your music

00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:17.800
or from your art.

00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:26.990
And it can lead to a really deep
rut that you can't get out of.

00:58:26.990 --> 00:58:29.700
But a piece of music
or a concert you go see

00:58:29.700 --> 00:58:32.635
or something can, like,
just make everything

00:58:32.635 --> 00:58:34.834
feel good again.

00:58:34.834 --> 00:58:39.720
AUDIENCE: Will you come through
Santa Cruz on your next tour?

00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:41.700
BRETT DENNEN: We are
planning a tour right now,

00:58:41.700 --> 00:58:47.260
and I don't think we
have Santa Cruz in there.

00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:54.470
But I will eventually, probably
in the fall at the soonest.

00:58:54.470 --> 00:58:56.990
JAMES DRISCOLL: I think we have
time for one more question.

00:58:56.990 --> 00:58:57.740
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:58:57.740 --> 00:58:59.360
That's me.

00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:02.345
So I, first of
all, I learned how

00:59:02.345 --> 00:59:04.470
to play guitar and, like,
singing and start playing

00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:05.910
music from your music.

00:59:05.910 --> 00:59:08.180
So I think, like, my
first Starbucks show ever,

00:59:08.180 --> 00:59:10.470
I did, like, a bunch
of your covers.

00:59:10.470 --> 00:59:12.510
So this is like awesome
that I'm here right now.

00:59:12.510 --> 00:59:16.070
But we kind of just
talked about how

00:59:16.070 --> 00:59:18.530
you make people feel
kind of like vulnerable

00:59:18.530 --> 00:59:19.800
and tap into their emotions.

00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:22.240
And I think part of that
is, like, your lyrics are

00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:23.840
so personal.

00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:25.951
And I just-- maybe
this comes easy to you,

00:59:25.951 --> 00:59:27.700
but if you have any
advice for those of us

00:59:27.700 --> 00:59:30.550
who it doesn't, like
sometimes when I write music,

00:59:30.550 --> 00:59:34.300
I'm worried to, like, be
so exposed to everyone,

00:59:34.300 --> 00:59:36.490
like, with-- it's, like,
your most inner thoughts.

00:59:36.490 --> 00:59:40.070
Like, do you have any advice
on how to get past that?

00:59:40.070 --> 00:59:43.320
BRETT DENNEN: Something
I learned recently

00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:47.220
that was really
hard for me to admit

00:59:47.220 --> 00:59:50.590
is that most people, when
they listen to music,

00:59:50.590 --> 00:59:53.260
the lyrics don't matter.

00:59:53.260 --> 00:59:58.890
And if they do matter, they
come second to the music.

00:59:58.890 --> 01:00:00.910
And that was hard
for me to swallow,

01:00:00.910 --> 01:00:06.030
because I spent so much
time slaving over lyrics.

01:00:06.030 --> 01:00:11.780
And you can have an
amazing lyric that's

01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:16.390
put to mediocre music,
and you put that up

01:00:16.390 --> 01:00:21.280
against amazing music
with a mediocre lyric,

01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:23.160
and that will win.

01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:25.910
The music always
wins, because music

01:00:25.910 --> 01:00:30.840
has a certain magic that you
can't grab or hold or feel.

01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:35.140
It just gets into-- it unlocks
memories and reminds you

01:00:35.140 --> 01:00:38.470
of things and gets
inside your heart

01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:41.280
and stirs your emotions up.

01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:43.760
Lyrics can do the same
thing, but the music does it

01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:47.610
on-- in a different way.

01:00:47.610 --> 01:00:53.280
So the point is, don't beat
yourself up over it too much.

01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:56.820
Just make sure it's honest.

01:00:56.820 --> 01:00:59.590
Doesn't have to be honest,
but if you're-- you sound like

01:00:59.590 --> 01:01:03.700
someone who really wants
to say something truthful.

01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:04.930
Then just be honest.

01:01:04.930 --> 01:01:07.217
And if you really
want to be honest

01:01:07.217 --> 01:01:09.050
and you want to say
something from the heart

01:01:09.050 --> 01:01:14.140
but you don't know how to
say it, I think you do,

01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:17.180
you just aren't giving
yourself permission,

01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:18.990
or you're not
digging deep enough,

01:01:18.990 --> 01:01:21.760
or there's something that
you know you want to say

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:23.860
but maybe you're
afraid to say it.

01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:25.570
And I'm projecting
on you right now,

01:01:25.570 --> 01:01:27.860
because that's what
always works for me.

01:01:27.860 --> 01:01:31.910
If there's something
I'm afraid to say,

01:01:31.910 --> 01:01:33.990
it is the most
meaningful to sing.

01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:39.490
And it doesn't have to rhyme.

01:01:39.490 --> 01:01:41.073
It doesn't have to--
there's no rules.

01:01:41.073 --> 01:01:44.273
It just-- as long
as it's authentic.

01:01:47.667 --> 01:01:48.750
JAMES DRISCOLL: Thank you.

01:01:48.750 --> 01:01:49.708
On that note, I think--

01:01:49.708 --> 01:01:50.534
[APPLAUSE]

01:01:50.534 --> 01:01:51.450
Thanks for being here.

01:01:51.450 --> 01:01:52.350
BRETT DENNEN: Yep.

01:01:52.350 --> 01:01:53.700
JAMES DRISCOLL: Thank you for
sharing your music with us

01:01:53.700 --> 01:01:54.200
today.

01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:57.200
[APPLAUSE]
