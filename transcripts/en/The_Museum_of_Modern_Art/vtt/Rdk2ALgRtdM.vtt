00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.010
Welcome to the Museum of Modern Art.

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.500
Here we are on the third floor in front of
"Louise Bourgeois: An Unfolding Portrait."

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:13.010
My name is Sewon Kang and I'm the curatorial
assistant helping Debbie Wai to curate the

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:14.010
show.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.080
Louise Bourgeois was a French-born, American
artist.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.200
She was first trained as a painter and a printmaker.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:26.609
And she only started to make sculpture in
the '30s and '40s, when she moved to New York

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.810
with her American husband, the well-regarded
art historian, Robert Goldwater.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:31.810
 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.220
She was just enamored with the skyscrapers
of New York.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.920
She was just thrilled by their verticality.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.300
That they were monuments to human achievement
was really exciting to her.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:48.500
And so she started to make these very anthropomorphized
works that harken to the skyscrapers that

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.360
were all around her.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.930
Louise Bourgeois was most well known for her
sculptures, her large-scale spiders and cells.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.399
But with this exhibition, we're trying to
show a lesser-known part of her practice,

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:02.440
which is the prints and the books.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.359
But first, a drawing from the '40s.

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:10.560
This is called "Sainte Sébastienne," and
you can see it's a similar feel as the totems

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.049
you saw in the other room.

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.060
Saint Sebastian was an early Christian martyr
and saint, and in the Renaissance, he started

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:25.280
to be depicted as this perfect, young man
being impaled with arrows.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.520
And in this moment of, maybe, his death he's
in incredible pain.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.140
You see he's, sort of like, in
this agony and this ecstasy.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.130
He's just perishing.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.349
He's been taken up as a subject by a lot of
different artists because of this, sort of,

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:45.789
non-normative depiction of desire and death.

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:51.739
But Louise Borgeois, in particular, was interested
in it as a depiction of pain.

00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:58.819
And so she called this "Sainte Sébastienne,"
because she wanted to feminize this very famous

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:00.270
or historical trope.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.999
This is the same subject, "Sainte
Sébastienne," that she did in the '90s.

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:11.650
So you see here that the figures come back
into the work with exaggerated features, so

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.129
you don't have any doubts that it's a woman
version of the saint.

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:18.130
And it's done in the printmaking technique,
drypoint.

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.560
And what's particularly fun and interesting
about her making, is that you can see how

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.659
an artist's imagination unfolds.

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:28.659
That's where the title of the exhibition comes
from actually.

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:32.129
It was a very generative medium for her in this way.

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:37.959
She loved working on the same image again
and again, and so each one became a different

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.180
exploration of the same topic.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.640
She likened the arrows to antagonisms, to
criticisms that she received, and that's where

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.790
this angry cat face comes out.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.250
It's, sort of, her mask, her protection.

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.299
So this wall is all working proofs.

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:55.900
And then the final products are over here.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.569
So these are two versions of the same image
that Louise ended up editioning.

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:06.829
And, in this example, it's stamped with the
metal sealing stamp of her father.

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:11.331
And she talked a lot about how her father
was very antagonistic toward her, that he

00:03:11.331 --> 00:03:16.840
criticized her all the time, embarrassing
her in front of their guests.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.749
And it really affected her.

00:03:18.749 --> 00:03:23.219
So in the second version, she's created her
own metal sealing stamp.

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:24.950
She and her father shared the same initials.

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.450
His name was Louis, and she was named Louise.

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:34.010
Actually, they were expecting a son and 
her mom named her Louise, because she wanted

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.620
to endear the child, who wasn't a boy, to
her father.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:43.870
But in contrast to her father's metal sealing
stamp, which is very hard to read, this calligraphic

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.500
LB, Louise's is much more geometric, much
more legible.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.459
And she did that because she said she wanted
to be readable.

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.459
She wanted people to understand her.

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.030
And she said that, "If people understood me,
they couldn't help but love me."

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.260
So here you see three eggs in this very strange and elaborate hairdo.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.969
She said that those were her three sons.

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:08.170
And, of course, she made this in the '90s.

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:15.349
Her sons were very much grown, and yet she
was looking to protect them from the criticisms

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:17.799
that she received herself.

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.759
And in this very large version you see here,
you see that she's failed.

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:32.250
She loses her head because she can't withstand
all of the pain of the antagonisms.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.680
And she likened these lines in the woman's
form to tree rings.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.220
Saint Sebastian, in traditional renderings,
is usually tied to a tree, and so you see

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.699
here that the woman has become the tree.

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:47.650
So these works are all from the '90s, when
she was an 80-year old woman.

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.039
She is highly prolific.

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:55.380
She was making art until the very last days
of her life when she died at 98.

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:00.069
But I also wanna show you this earlier work
that's very much related to these

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:01.590
works from the '90s.

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.849
So this is a self-portrait, another self-portrait
of Louise as a "bird woman."

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:08.680
And you see again the three eggs in the bowl.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.910
That's, again, her three sons.

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:15.200
And in contrast to the "Sainte Sébastienne"
works, this is a really happy scene.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:20.569
And you can tell it's a happy scene, because
of her beautiful long hair and because of

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:22.330
her pearl necklace.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.150
Those were recurring motifs in her life.

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:31.639
And so you can see she's in a very good mood
in this image, but she described

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:37.210
it in a way that reminds you of her pain and
that the subject of pain was the business

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:38.210
she was in.

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:39.629
That's what she said.

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:45.080
She said that she's ready to protect her eggs,
but if she needs to, she can also take flight.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.240
If she needs to get away, she can make a getaway.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.819
So since I've only been able to show you a
small portion of the works in the exhibition,

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:55.580
I hope you'll come in to the museum to see
it yourself.

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:00.181
And please check out "Louise Bourgeois: The
Complete Prints &amp; Books," which is the

00:06:00.181 --> 00:06:03.810
online catalog of all of her works in the
medium.

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:09.840
And we hope you'll check out the YouTube channel
to learn more about Louise Bourgeois and other

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:10.389
