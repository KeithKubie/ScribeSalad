00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.330
Cancer is made of cells, just like anything.

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.359
A cancerous tumor is simply a collection of
cells, that are rebelling.

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.630
There are trillions of cells in the human
body (estimates range from about 15 to 70

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:12.860
trillion, it’s hard to say for sure).

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.570
All these cells are making copies of themselves,
replicating and copying their own DNA all

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.570
the time.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.409
And as much as we want it to be, nothing is
perfect.

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:25.939
Sometimes, they just naturally rebel and become
cancer.

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.679
Let’s break this down so we all are on the
same page.

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:31.980
Different cells replicate at different rates
-- a red blood cell lives about four months,

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.920
a skin cell lives a few weeks, and cells in
the colon only live a few days.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.469
By the time you’re 50, you’ve gone through
about 4600 generations of colon cells!

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:42.829
That’s insane!

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.309
By the time you’re 70, you’ve almost had
six and a half thousand new colons… many

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.230
millions of cells in the colon dividing six
and a half thousand times with tiny errors

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.750
popping up here and there… it’s no wonder
cells become abnormal.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.090
Most of the time in talk about avoiding cancer
you’ll hear, like… don’t eat processed

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.620
meat, it’s a carcinogen!

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.540
Don’t smoke, the crap in the cigarettes
will give you lung cancer!

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.740
Stay out of the sun because UV light will
give you skin cancer!

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.550
And that is all true!

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.960
But, all those cancers happen for the same
reason.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.200
Simply put, compounds in the smoke, or meat
from the processing, or UV radiation from

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.880
the sun -- all mess with DNA in your cells.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.470
When your DNA is screwed with it can sometimes
mutate in such a way that it becomes cancer…

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.090
And this can happen even without outside influences.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.210
Mutations happen naturally!

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.790
So, two years ago, a paper was published that
said most cancers in the U.S. weren’t caused

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.130
by smoking or UV exposure, or lifestyle factors
--

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.440
but by regular ol’ DNA replication.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.290
Sometimes cancer just... happens.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.610
The paper says that while 40 percent of cancers
can be prevented with healthy lifestyle choices,

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.630
the remainder of cancer causes were inherited
traits or just dumb luck.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.250
Just problems in cell replication.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.360
Skeptical scientists were quick to jump on
this original paper -- in part, because it

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.820
was only done in the U.S..

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.410
The lives of people in the United States are
not the same as people everywhere -- it’s

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.650
not easily generalizable to all the humans
in the world, right?

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:13.650
Right.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.360
So, the scientists heard the critique and
did the whole study again.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.010
It took them two years.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.160
This time they included data from 69 countries,
and added more cancer types!

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.950
They found the same thing.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.570
66 percent of cancers just, happen.

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.090
And the rest were environmental factors, lifestyle
choices and genetics.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.550
For example: most brain and prostate cancers,
as well as cancers in children are caused

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.310
by DNA copy errors -- while some lung cancers
are mostly due to environmental factors!

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.690
So, DON’T SMOKE.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.909
But also, yikes for kids.

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:49.379
It’s probably not a surprise, but many doctors
aren’t happy with this paper.

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:53.849
How can we “cure cancer” if cancer is
a normal part of a healthy DNA replication

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:54.849
cycle?

00:02:54.849 --> 00:03:00.260
I mean, you can still cut your risk by nearly
half by living healthily, but overall -- cancer

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.409
may be just… inevitable, for some.

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:09.650
This is why we need to focus on UNDERSTANDING
cancer on top of the talk of CURING it.

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.519
You can cure a cancer as a symptom, but you
can’t cure cancer the mutation without a

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:15.519
lot more science.

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:20.140
If we just think of cancer as this infection,
that happens to people who don’t live right

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:26.000
or who are unlucky, then we’re ignoring
the pure mathematics of DNA replication.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.600
We’re not being honest with ourselves.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.830
Cancer sucks.

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.150
But it’s also a normal part of life on this
planet, and just like anything else -- the

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.640
sooner we accept it, and understand it, the
better off we’ll all be at figuring out

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.450
how we can all just live.

If cancer is just cells, and lots of animals
get cancer, I wonder if I’ve ever eaten

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:04.939
cancer?

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:05.939
Have you thought about that?

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:07.070
So gross.

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.480
Also gross things I’ve never thought about,

flesh taste like, and which bit of us is most
nutritious.”
