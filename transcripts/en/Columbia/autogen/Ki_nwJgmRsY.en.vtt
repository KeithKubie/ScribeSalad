really attached a lot of value to

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090
really attached a lot of value to
 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.750
really attached a lot of value to
hands-on practice and the

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760
sometimes this delicate dance that you
 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.650
sometimes this delicate dance that you
probably all know between users and

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660
probably all know between users and
 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.210
probably all know between users and
technologies or tools so like in the

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220
technologies or tools so like in the
 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.800
technologies or tools so like in the

iphone but sometimes may seem like the
 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.280
iphone but sometimes may seem like the
iphone is actually using you and this

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290
iphone is actually using you and this

visionary the the importance of making
 

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:18.670
visionary the the importance of making
use of semantic web standards but so our

to this kind of a cynical vision

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:24.530
to this kind of a cynical vision
 

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:27.570
to this kind of a cynical vision
sometimes on how technologies are

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:27.580
sometimes on how technologies are
 

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:31.659
sometimes on how technologies are
promoted or imposed upon cultural

heritage institutions so here we really

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:34.010
heritage institutions so here we really
 

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:36.700
heritage institutions so here we really
get back to the fundamental point of a

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:36.710
get back to the fundamental point of a
 

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:39.430
get back to the fundamental point of a
project so first of all and this is

00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:39.440
project so first of all and this is
 

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:41.760
project so first of all and this is
really a something which will be

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:41.770
really a something which will be
 

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:45.390
really a something which will be
explained in detail by my colleague max

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:45.400
explained in detail by my colleague max
 

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:48.850
explained in detail by my colleague max
all metadata are our messy so it's

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:48.860
all metadata are our messy so it's
 

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:50.800
all metadata are our messy so it's
extremely important to have look at

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:50.810
extremely important to have look at
 

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:53.440
extremely important to have look at
tools which you can use to kind of

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:53.450
tools which you can use to kind of
 

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:56.680
tools which you can use to kind of
diagnose the the quality of your of your

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:56.690
diagnose the the quality of your of your
 

00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:58.390
diagnose the the quality of your of your
metadata and the 10 or 15 years I have

00:08:58.390 --> 00:08:58.400
metadata and the 10 or 15 years I have
 

00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:59.680
metadata and the 10 or 15 years I have
been working in the field I've never

00:08:59.680 --> 00:08:59.690
been working in the field I've never
 

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:01.660
been working in the field I've never
received an export of a museum or

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:01.670
received an export of a museum or
 

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:04.540
received an export of a museum or
library which was completely clean so

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:04.550
library which was completely clean so
 

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:06.880
library which was completely clean so
it's just kind of a common stance or a

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:06.890
it's just kind of a common stance or a
 

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:11.140
it's just kind of a common stance or a
common ground which we should assume for

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:11.150
common ground which we should assume for
 

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:13.660
common ground which we should assume for
our project and for the publication we

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:13.670
our project and for the publication we
 

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:15.490
our project and for the publication we
worked on this summer we're extremely

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:15.500
worked on this summer we're extremely
 

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.340
worked on this summer we're extremely
happy to use or it wasn't obvious for us

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:18.350
happy to use or it wasn't obvious for us
 

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:21.400
happy to use or it wasn't obvious for us
to find an export of metadata upon which

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:21.410
to find an export of metadata upon which
 

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:24.430
to find an export of metadata upon which
we could work and so we're very happy to

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:24.440
we could work and so we're very happy to
 

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.110
we could work and so we're very happy to
cooperate with the people of the

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:26.120
cooperate with the people of the
 

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.449
cooperate with the people of the
Powerhouse Museum which have had over

00:09:28.449 --> 00:09:28.459
Powerhouse Museum which have had over
 

00:09:28.459 --> 00:09:30.160
Powerhouse Museum which have had over
the past and will have also in the

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:30.170
the past and will have also in the
 

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:33.570

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:36.400
future a very progressive vision on
publicly making available their data and

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:36.410
publicly making available their data and
 

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:39.280
publicly making available their data and
it's also a very nice example of what

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:39.290
it's also a very nice example of what
 

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:41.050
it's also a very nice example of what
actually happens or what other people

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:41.060
actually happens or what other people

Ruben will focus on

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:51.220
Ruben will focus on
 

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:53.699

show in a very hands-on manner how this

00:10:11.309 --> 00:10:11.319
show in a very hands-on manner how this
 

00:10:11.319 --> 00:10:16.170

this all works but so this was just a

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:16.180
this all works but so this was just a
 

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:18.449
this all works but so this was just a
very general introduction of the the

00:10:18.449 --> 00:10:18.459
very general introduction of the the
 

00:10:18.459 --> 00:10:20.309
very general introduction of the the
theme and the the content of the the

00:10:20.309 --> 00:10:20.319
theme and the the content of the the
 

00:10:20.319 --> 00:10:26.699
theme and the the content of the the
presentation but so the really the bulk

00:10:26.699 --> 00:10:26.709
presentation but so the really the bulk
 

00:10:26.709 --> 00:10:29.220

of the the talk of today will consist of

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:29.230
of the the talk of today will consist of
 

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:31.439
of the the talk of today will consist of
a very practical overview of how to use

00:10:31.439 --> 00:10:31.449
a very practical overview of how to use

Google refine for metadata cleaning and

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:35.170
Google refine for metadata cleaning and
 

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:37.259
Google refine for metadata cleaning and
reconciliation and then at the end

00:10:37.259 --> 00:10:37.269
reconciliation and then at the end
 

00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:40.530
reconciliation and then at the end
really hope or apparently are Robbie and

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:40.540
really hope or apparently are Robbie and
 

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:42.240
really hope or apparently are Robbie and
their colleague already told us a bit

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:42.250
their colleague already told us a bit
 

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:46.999
their colleague already told us a bit
about some issues that were perhaps

00:10:46.999 --> 00:10:47.009
 
 

00:10:47.009 --> 00:10:50.189
 
present in some digital library projects

00:10:50.189 --> 00:10:50.199
present in some digital library projects
 

00:10:50.199 --> 00:10:51.990
present in some digital library projects
really hope that at the end of the talk

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:52.000
really hope that at the end of the talk
 

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.090
really hope that at the end of the talk
we can discuss about the specific

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:54.100
we can discuss about the specific
 

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:57.449
we can discuss about the specific
problems you have and which way our work

00:10:57.449 --> 00:10:57.459
problems you have and which way our work
 

00:10:57.459 --> 00:11:01.559
problems you have and which way our work
could eventually help to to enhance some

00:11:01.559 --> 00:11:01.569
could eventually help to to enhance some
 

00:11:01.569 --> 00:11:05.129
could eventually help to to enhance some
of your metadata but so from a

00:11:05.129 --> 00:11:05.139
of your metadata but so from a
 

00:11:05.139 --> 00:11:08.639
of your metadata but so from a
methodological point of view the the

00:11:08.639 --> 00:11:08.649
methodological point of view the the
 

00:11:08.649 --> 00:11:12.030
methodological point of view the the
first step is really to use as a common

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:12.040
first step is really to use as a common
 

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:14.189
first step is really to use as a common
ground that all metadata are messy and

00:11:14.189 --> 00:11:14.199
ground that all metadata are messy and
 

00:11:14.199 --> 00:11:16.290
ground that all metadata are messy and
therefore it's extremely important to

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:16.300
therefore it's extremely important to
 

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:20.819
therefore it's extremely important to
analyze to try to gather a diagnosis of

00:11:20.819 --> 00:11:20.829
analyze to try to gather a diagnosis of
 

00:11:20.829 --> 00:11:23.549
analyze to try to gather a diagnosis of
the quality issues your collection is

00:11:23.549 --> 00:11:23.559
the quality issues your collection is
 

00:11:23.559 --> 00:11:27.079
the quality issues your collection is
faced with then the second step is to go

00:11:27.079 --> 00:11:27.089
faced with then the second step is to go
 

00:11:27.089 --> 00:11:29.040
faced with then the second step is to go
towards standardization and

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:29.050
towards standardization and
 

00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:31.679
towards standardization and
normalization again will show a lot of

00:11:31.679 --> 00:11:31.689
normalization again will show a lot of
 

00:11:31.689 --> 00:11:33.749
normalization again will show a lot of
concrete examples on how to do that and

00:11:33.749 --> 00:11:33.759
concrete examples on how to do that and
 

00:11:33.759 --> 00:11:36.360
concrete examples on how to do that and
then the last step which is in a way

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:36.370
then the last step which is in a way
 

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:38.100
then the last step which is in a way
fundamental here is the whole

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:38.110
fundamental here is the whole
 

00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:40.290
fundamental here is the whole
reconciliation or the mapping of your

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:40.300
reconciliation or the mapping of your
 

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:44.249
reconciliation or the mapping of your
local vocabularies with elements which

00:11:44.249 --> 00:11:44.259
local vocabularies with elements which
 

00:11:44.259 --> 00:11:45.809
local vocabularies with elements which
are already part of the linked data

00:11:45.809 --> 00:11:45.819
are already part of the linked data
 

00:11:45.819 --> 00:11:50.179

clouds but so before I give the floor to

00:11:50.179 --> 00:11:50.189
clouds but so before I give the floor to
 

00:11:50.189 --> 00:11:53.970
clouds but so before I give the floor to
max I would just like to briefly talk a

00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:53.980
max I would just like to briefly talk a
 

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.999
max I would just like to briefly talk a
bit about this notion of quality again

00:11:56.999 --> 00:11:57.009
bit about this notion of quality again
 

00:11:57.009 --> 00:11:59.370
bit about this notion of quality again
we were just an hour ago talking about

00:11:59.370 --> 00:11:59.380
we were just an hour ago talking about
 

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:01.319
we were just an hour ago talking about
this fundamental problem of how to

00:12:01.319 --> 00:12:01.329
this fundamental problem of how to
 

00:12:01.329 --> 00:12:03.900
this fundamental problem of how to
define quality because at the end of the

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:03.910
define quality because at the end of the
 

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:04.830
define quality because at the end of the

upon quality where is it we're living in

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:27.430
upon quality where is it we're living in
 

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:29.850
upon quality where is it we're living in
a pimpy racal world which keeps on

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:29.860
a pimpy racal world which keeps on
 

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:31.650
a pimpy racal world which keeps on
moving through our time so at no point

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:31.660
moving through our time so at no point
 

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:35.220
moving through our time so at no point
in time it's really fundamentally

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:35.230
in time it's really fundamentally
 

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:37.170
in time it's really fundamentally
possible to say are in a binary way

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:37.180
possible to say are in a binary way

possible to say are in a binary way
something is correct or not so that's

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:39.880
something is correct or not so that's
 

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:41.160
something is correct or not so that's
why it's important to realize that

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:41.170
why it's important to realize that
 

00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:43.440
why it's important to realize that
quality is fundamentally relative and

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:43.450
quality is fundamentally relative and
 

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:47.100
quality is fundamentally relative and
this gets back to the the second sense

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:47.110
this gets back to the the second sense
 

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:49.770
this gets back to the the second sense
of meta in metadata people always think

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:49.780
of meta in metadata people always think
 

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:53.430
of meta in metadata people always think
about metadata or major in meta data as

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:53.440
about metadata or major in meta data as
 

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.380
about metadata or major in meta data as
being on a more abstract level which is

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:55.390
being on a more abstract level which is
 

00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:57.330
being on a more abstract level which is
the first sense but it's also very

00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:57.340
the first sense but it's also very
 

00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:59.250
the first sense but it's also very
important to think about the second

00:12:59.250 --> 00:12:59.260
important to think about the second
 

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.830
important to think about the second
sense that made the house which is the

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:01.840
sense that made the house which is the
 

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:05.130
sense that made the house which is the
notion of change so metastasis or for

00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:05.140
notion of change so metastasis or for
 

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:09.570
notion of change so metastasis or for
example refers to this fundamental

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:09.580
example refers to this fundamental
 

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:12.630
example refers to this fundamental
notion of evolution to our time and this

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:12.640
notion of evolution to our time and this
 

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:15.090
notion of evolution to our time and this
gets us back to really the importance of

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:15.100
gets us back to really the importance of
 

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:17.610
gets us back to really the importance of
using a tool such as Google refine we

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:17.620
using a tool such as Google refine we
 

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:21.020
using a tool such as Google refine we
also have other types of tools to really

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:21.030
also have other types of tools to really
 

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:24.630
also have other types of tools to really

floor to max who will now really talk
 

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:53.340
floor to max who will now really talk
about the first fundamental step which

00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:53.350
about the first fundamental step which
 

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:59.640
about the first fundamental step which
is clean okay so yes let's go more

categories which will be really very

00:18:02.919 --> 00:18:02.929
categories which will be really very
 

00:18:02.929 --> 00:18:05.350
categories which will be really very
interesting to use that those are

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:05.360
interesting to use that those are
 

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:11.669
interesting to use that those are
keywords from controlled vocabularies

00:18:11.669 --> 00:18:11.679

we can first establish diagnosis of
 

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:36.220
we can first establish diagnosis of
what's what's okay in there and what are

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:36.230
what's what's okay in there and what are
 

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:39.490
what's what's okay in there and what are
the potential metadata problems and then

00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:39.500
the potential metadata problems and then
 

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:42.520
the potential metadata problems and then
how we can improve them in the same

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:42.530
how we can improve them in the same
 

00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:43.240
how we can improve them in the same

so let's start with the record IDs

00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:47.320
so let's start with the record IDs
 

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.510
so let's start with the record IDs
obviously all objects in the collection

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:49.520
obviously all objects in the collection
 

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:54.370
obviously all objects in the collection
should have 90 so here first operation

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:54.380
should have 90 so here first operation
 

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:59.460
should have 90 so here first operation
I'll create a facet and as I these are

00:18:59.460 --> 00:18:59.470
I'll create a facet and as I these are
 

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:02.770
I'll create a facet and as I these are
numerical values it's an Emmerich faucet

00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:02.780
numerical values it's an Emmerich faucet
 

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:07.500
numerical values it's an Emmerich faucet
so I create create that and we refine

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:07.510
so I create create that and we refine
 

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:12.640
so I create create that and we refine
finds out there that nearly all ids are

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:12.650
finds out there that nearly all ids are
 

00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:16.180
finds out there that nearly all ids are
never acquiesce pected we don't have

00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:16.190
never acquiesce pected we don't have
 

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:19.450
never acquiesce pected we don't have
blank values but we have non numeric

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:19.460
blank values but we have non numeric
 

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:22.690
blank values but we have non numeric
values only three but that's strange so

00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:22.700
values only three but that's strange so
 

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:26.580
values only three but that's strange so
let's have a look at them and in fact

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:26.590
let's have a look at them and in fact
 

00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:29.530
let's have a look at them and in fact
there are non-numeric because they're

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:29.540
there are non-numeric because they're
 

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:33.700
there are non-numeric because they're
black so why are aren't there here are

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:33.710
black so why are aren't there here are
 

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:37.000
black so why are aren't there here are
listed as blank it's because we have a

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:37.010
listed as blank it's because we have a
 

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:41.140
listed as blank it's because we have a
single white space here so okay it's as

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:41.150
single white space here so okay it's as
 

00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:44.950
single white space here so okay it's as
if they were blank and that's already

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:44.960
if they were blank and that's already
 

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:48.100
if they were blank and that's already
problem so we don't have anything here

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:48.110
problem so we don't have anything here
 

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:53.170
problem so we don't have anything here
we just have blank raus so we can remove

00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:53.180
we just have blank raus so we can remove
 

00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:57.280
we just have blank raus so we can remove
them because they're meaningless ok so I

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:57.290
them because they're meaningless ok so I
 

00:19:57.290 --> 00:20:00.390
them because they're meaningless ok so I
remove those three matching robes and

00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:00.400
remove those three matching robes and
 

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:05.440
remove those three matching robes and
I've already performed an operation so I

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:05.450
I've already performed an operation so I
 

00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:08.860
I've already performed an operation so I
had first i diagnosed that there was a

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:08.870
had first i diagnosed that there was a
 

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:11.110
had first i diagnosed that there was a
small problem it's very easy of course

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:11.120
small problem it's very easy of course
 

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:15.880
small problem it's very easy of course
three rows were blank and I already

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:15.890
three rows were blank and I already
 

00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:18.600
three rows were blank and I already
removed them without affecting the

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:18.610
removed them without affecting the
 

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:22.570
removed them without affecting the
original collection so the file i loaded

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:22.580
original collection so the file i loaded
 

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:26.140
original collection so the file i loaded
is remains unchanged but the project

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:26.150
is remains unchanged but the project
 

00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:28.990
is remains unchanged but the project
loaded into Google refine is changed and

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:29.000
loaded into Google refine is changed and
 

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.890
loaded into Google refine is changed and
at the end I can export it to have a new

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:32.900
at the end I can export it to have a new
 

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:38.350
at the end I can export it to have a new
file with the quality improved and if

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:38.360
file with the quality improved and if
 

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:41.800
file with the quality improved and if
you do any mistake there's a nice

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:41.810
you do any mistake there's a nice
 

00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:45.100
you do any mistake there's a nice
history of undo/redo here so you can

00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:45.110
history of undo/redo here so you can
 

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:48.640
history of undo/redo here so you can
always try and change things you can

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:48.650
always try and change things you can
 

00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:51.790
always try and change things you can
always go back with a kind of time

00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:51.800
always go back with a kind of time
 

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:54.730
always go back with a kind of time
machine here that's nice too

00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:54.740
machine here that's nice too
 

00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:58.690
machine here that's nice too
okay so next step we've been removing

00:20:58.690 --> 00:20:58.700
okay so next step we've been removing
 

00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:01.210
okay so next step we've been removing
blank cells but maybe there are so

00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:01.220
blank cells but maybe there are so
 

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:05.830
blank cells but maybe there are so
duplicates in their objects of figuring

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:05.840
duplicates in their objects of figuring
 

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:08.049
duplicates in their objects of figuring
twice or more in the collections in

00:21:08.049 --> 00:21:08.059
twice or more in the collections in
 

00:21:08.059 --> 00:21:12.910
twice or more in the collections in
order to see this we'll have to sort the

00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:12.920
order to see this we'll have to sort the
 

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:17.049
order to see this we'll have to sort the
objects by IDs these are numbers so I

00:21:17.049 --> 00:21:17.059
objects by IDs these are numbers so I
 

00:21:17.059 --> 00:21:19.780
objects by IDs these are numbers so I
check numbers and smooth first that's

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:19.790
check numbers and smooth first that's
 

00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:25.240
check numbers and smooth first that's
perfect okay let's solve them and in

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:25.250
perfect okay let's solve them and in
 

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:30.299
perfect okay let's solve them and in
order yeah the sorting should not be a

00:21:30.299 --> 00:21:30.309
order yeah the sorting should not be a
 

00:21:30.309 --> 00:21:33.910
order yeah the sorting should not be a
temporary it should be made permanent so

00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:33.920
temporary it should be made permanent so
 

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:36.790
temporary it should be made permanent so
I just check here reorder this Rose

00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:36.800
I just check here reorder this Rose
 

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:39.700
I just check here reorder this Rose
permanently I want them to stay in

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:39.710
permanently I want them to stay in
 

00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:46.720
permanently I want them to stay in
that's older okay now if two objects in

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:46.730
that's older okay now if two objects in
 

00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:51.549
that's older okay now if two objects in
a row have the same ID that's because

00:21:51.549 --> 00:21:51.559
a row have the same ID that's because
 

00:21:51.559 --> 00:21:54.840
a row have the same ID that's because
they're duplicates so to see this I'll

00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:54.850
they're duplicates so to see this I'll
 

00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:59.290
they're duplicates so to see this I'll
blank down another operation lying down

00:21:59.290 --> 00:21:59.300
blank down another operation lying down
 

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:02.470
blank down another operation lying down
all consecutive objects having the same

00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:02.480
all consecutive objects having the same
 

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:06.430
all consecutive objects having the same
idea I blind them down and I immediately

00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:06.440
idea I blind them down and I immediately
 

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:11.560
idea I blind them down and I immediately
see a t4 cells were affected here on the

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:11.570
see a t4 cells were affected here on the
 

00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:15.549
see a t4 cells were affected here on the
top so we'll have a look at those cells

00:22:15.549 --> 00:22:15.559
top so we'll have a look at those cells
 

00:22:15.559 --> 00:22:18.480
top so we'll have a look at those cells
having a new kind of facets and

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:18.490
having a new kind of facets and
 

00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:21.370
having a new kind of facets and
customized customized facets we have

00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:21.380
customized customized facets we have
 

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:26.880
customized customized facets we have
fasted by blank to find blank values and

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:26.890
fasted by blank to find blank values and
 

00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:29.950
fasted by blank to find blank values and
foremost objects it's false they're not

00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:29.960
foremost objects it's false they're not
 

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:34.270
foremost objects it's false they're not
blank but 84 of them are blank so we'll

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:34.280
blank but 84 of them are blank so we'll
 

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:37.299
blank but 84 of them are blank so we'll
have a look at them here they don't have

00:22:37.299 --> 00:22:37.309
have a look at them here they don't have
 

00:22:37.309 --> 00:22:40.510
have a look at them here they don't have
any record ID because it was blank down

00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:40.520
any record ID because it was blank down
 

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:45.640
any record ID because it was blank down
so how do we how could we be sure these

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:45.650
so how do we how could we be sure these
 

00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:49.840
so how do we how could we be sure these
are duplicates we can by switching

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:49.850
are duplicates we can by switching
 

00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:53.440
are duplicates we can by switching
between those two views here in Google

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:53.450
between those two views here in Google
 

00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:57.220
between those two views here in Google
refine have the rouse view just one row

00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:57.230
refine have the rouse view just one row
 

00:22:57.230 --> 00:23:02.680
refine have the rouse view just one row
44 yeah every different different row

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:02.690
44 yeah every different different row
 

00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:06.490
44 yeah every different different row
but we can also switch to wear a records

00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:06.500
but we can also switch to wear a records
 

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:08.320
but we can also switch to wear a records
view which

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:08.330
view which
 

00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:11.289
view which
I'll be doing now and here we have a

00:23:11.289 --> 00:23:11.299
I'll be doing now and here we have a
 

00:23:11.299 --> 00:23:15.460
I'll be doing now and here we have a
clear view that we had duplicate here

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:15.470
clear view that we had duplicate here
 

00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:18.419
clear view that we had duplicate here
those two objects are exactly the same

00:23:18.419 --> 00:23:18.429
those two objects are exactly the same
 

00:23:18.429 --> 00:23:21.240
those two objects are exactly the same
titles is the same day registration

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:21.250
titles is the same day registration
 

00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:25.570
titles is the same day registration
number also and so on and so on so by

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:25.580
number also and so on and so on so by
 

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:28.870
number also and so on and so on so by
switching to this records view I'm sure

00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:28.880
switching to this records view I'm sure
 

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:32.380
switching to this records view I'm sure
this were real duplicates that can be

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:32.390
this were real duplicates that can be
 

00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:34.779
this were real duplicates that can be
removed from the collection so I switch

00:23:34.779 --> 00:23:34.789
removed from the collection so I switch
 

00:23:34.789 --> 00:23:39.090
removed from the collection so I switch
back to the other view and I choose to

00:23:39.090 --> 00:23:39.100
back to the other view and I choose to
 

00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:45.549
back to the other view and I choose to
remove all matching rows also okay so no

00:23:45.549 --> 00:23:45.559
remove all matching rows also okay so no
 

00:23:45.559 --> 00:23:49.840
remove all matching rows also okay so no
it should be okay but still let's have

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:49.850
it should be okay but still let's have
 

00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:53.519
it should be okay but still let's have
another facet of blank facets on the

00:23:53.519 --> 00:23:53.529
another facet of blank facets on the
 

00:23:53.529 --> 00:23:59.409
another facet of blank facets on the
registration number and we see that over

00:23:59.409 --> 00:23:59.419
registration number and we see that over
 

00:23:59.419 --> 00:24:03.639
registration number and we see that over
100 are still blank is because the

00:24:03.639 --> 00:24:03.649
100 are still blank is because the
 

00:24:03.649 --> 00:24:07.149
100 are still blank is because the
Heather record ID but that's all we only

00:24:07.149 --> 00:24:07.159
Heather record ID but that's all we only
 

00:24:07.159 --> 00:24:09.850
Heather record ID but that's all we only
had an idea and nothing else so that's

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:09.860
had an idea and nothing else so that's
 

00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:12.840
had an idea and nothing else so that's
not a gravity issue here are some

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:12.850
not a gravity issue here are some
 

00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:15.789
not a gravity issue here are some
objects in collections were awarded an

00:24:15.789 --> 00:24:15.799
objects in collections were awarded an
 

00:24:15.799 --> 00:24:18.430
objects in collections were awarded an
ideal but there's nothing corresponding

00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:18.440
ideal but there's nothing corresponding
 

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:20.830
ideal but there's nothing corresponding
to this idea and we're not interested

00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:20.840
to this idea and we're not interested
 

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:23.889
to this idea and we're not interested
obviously in those objects right now we

00:24:23.889 --> 00:24:23.899
obviously in those objects right now we
 

00:24:23.899 --> 00:24:26.700
obviously in those objects right now we
should of course in a real well check

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:26.710
should of course in a real well check
 

00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:30.759
should of course in a real well check
why those IDs were attributed here we

00:24:30.759 --> 00:24:30.769
why those IDs were attributed here we
 

00:24:30.769 --> 00:24:32.769
why those IDs were attributed here we
don't need them so I can also remove

00:24:32.769 --> 00:24:32.779
don't need them so I can also remove
 

00:24:32.779 --> 00:24:39.759
don't need them so I can also remove
them I remove all matching rods okay so

00:24:39.759 --> 00:24:39.769
them I remove all matching rods okay so
 

00:24:39.769 --> 00:24:42.730
them I remove all matching rods okay so
we only worked with numbers but of

00:24:42.730 --> 00:24:42.740
we only worked with numbers but of
 

00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:44.470
we only worked with numbers but of
course we can look at something else

00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:44.480
course we can look at something else
 

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:48.879
course we can look at something else
like the production dates dates should

00:24:48.879 --> 00:24:48.889
like the production dates dates should
 

00:24:48.889 --> 00:24:51.909
like the production dates dates should
be number as well so i will check that

00:24:51.909 --> 00:24:51.919
be number as well so i will check that
 

00:24:51.919 --> 00:24:57.070
be number as well so i will check that
with an numeric facet and we we can see

00:24:57.070 --> 00:24:57.080
with an numeric facet and we we can see
 

00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:01.990
with an numeric facet and we we can see
most most objects are blank for that

00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:02.000
most most objects are blank for that
 

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.019
most most objects are blank for that
felt here I don't know if if you see it

00:25:05.019 --> 00:25:05.029
felt here I don't know if if you see it
 

00:25:05.029 --> 00:25:11.139
felt here I don't know if if you see it
it's grey but yes 755 thousands objects

00:25:11.139 --> 00:25:11.149
it's grey but yes 755 thousands objects
 

00:25:11.149 --> 00:25:13.990
it's grey but yes 755 thousands objects
don't have data at all so that's also an

00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:14.000
don't have data at all so that's also an
 

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.600
don't have data at all so that's also an
issue and in the remaining ones lots of

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:19.610
issue and in the remaining ones lots of
 

00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:22.180
issue and in the remaining ones lots of
them are non-numeric which is strange

00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:22.190
them are non-numeric which is strange
 

00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:26.980
them are non-numeric which is strange
for dates we can see why it's because

00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:26.990
for dates we can see why it's because
 

00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:30.909
for dates we can see why it's because
they use or they also use ranges okay so

00:25:30.909 --> 00:25:30.919
they use or they also use ranges okay so
 

00:25:30.919 --> 00:25:33.519
they use or they also use ranges okay so
in the same field here we have no

00:25:33.519 --> 00:25:33.529
in the same field here we have no
 

00:25:33.529 --> 00:25:38.080
in the same field here we have no
integrity constraint we have ranges with

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:38.090
integrity constraint we have ranges with
 

00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:42.490
integrity constraint we have ranges with
two different dates and we have real

00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:42.500
two different dates and we have real
 

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:46.619
two different dates and we have real
single dates as well in the same color

00:25:46.619 --> 00:25:46.629
single dates as well in the same color
 

00:25:46.629 --> 00:25:49.629
single dates as well in the same color
okay that's another interesting thing to

00:25:49.629 --> 00:25:49.639
okay that's another interesting thing to
 

00:25:49.639 --> 00:25:57.999
okay that's another interesting thing to
notice one yeah one more example here

00:25:57.999 --> 00:25:58.009
notice one yeah one more example here
 

00:25:58.009 --> 00:26:02.169
notice one yeah one more example here
with the dimensions if I do a blank

00:26:02.169 --> 00:26:02.179
with the dimensions if I do a blank
 

00:26:02.179 --> 00:26:05.320
with the dimensions if I do a blank
facets for example on the hate-filled

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:05.330
facets for example on the hate-filled
 

00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:12.159
facets for example on the hate-filled
field okay I ignore those that are blank

00:26:12.159 --> 00:26:12.169
field okay I ignore those that are blank
 

00:26:12.169 --> 00:26:17.320
field okay I ignore those that are blank
but the other ones most of them here are

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:17.330
but the other ones most of them here are
 

00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:21.850
but the other ones most of them here are
expressed in millimeters so if we look

00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:21.860
expressed in millimeters so if we look
 

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:26.340
expressed in millimeters so if we look
yeah it's always millimeters but i'll

00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:26.350
yeah it's always millimeters but i'll
 

00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:29.740
yeah it's always millimeters but i'll
use another tool the text filter to see

00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:29.750
use another tool the text filter to see
 

00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:33.850
use another tool the text filter to see
if other units are used as well for

00:26:33.850 --> 00:26:33.860
if other units are used as well for
 

00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:37.840
if other units are used as well for
instance centimeters and yes only eight

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:37.850
instance centimeters and yes only eight
 

00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:39.970
instance centimeters and yes only eight
objects were not expressed in

00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:39.980
objects were not expressed in
 

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:42.999
objects were not expressed in
millimeters but in centimeters instead

00:26:42.999 --> 00:26:43.009
millimeters but in centimeters instead
 

00:26:43.009 --> 00:26:48.220
millimeters but in centimeters instead
so that that's also a problem there's no

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:48.230
so that that's also a problem there's no
 

00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:51.999
so that that's also a problem there's no
reason why those eight objects should be

00:26:51.999 --> 00:26:52.009
reason why those eight objects should be
 

00:26:52.009 --> 00:26:58.330
reason why those eight objects should be
expressed in another units okay we could

00:26:58.330 --> 00:26:58.340
expressed in another units okay we could
 

00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:04.289
expressed in another units okay we could
correct them but I wonder this right now

00:27:04.289 --> 00:27:04.299
 
 

00:27:04.299 --> 00:27:07.480
 
yeah and so on you can perform all kind

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:07.490
yeah and so on you can perform all kind
 

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:13.810
yeah and so on you can perform all kind
of analysis uh no other fields here for

00:27:13.810 --> 00:27:13.820
of analysis uh no other fields here for
 

00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:19.350
of analysis uh no other fields here for
instance the weights field almost every

00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:19.360
instance the weights field almost every
 

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:25.480
instance the weights field almost every
yeah almost no object has hate only less

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:25.490
yeah almost no object has hate only less
 

00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:28.930
yeah almost no object has hate only less
than 200 have one so is this it feels

00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:28.940
than 200 have one so is this it feels
 

00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:34.210
than 200 have one so is this it feels
really yeah do we need this

00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:34.220
really yeah do we need this
 

00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:38.930
really yeah do we need this
this fields if so few objects have a

00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:38.940
this fields if so few objects have a
 

00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:45.289
this fields if so few objects have a
hates included in the system okay but

00:27:45.289 --> 00:27:45.299
hates included in the system okay but
 

00:27:45.299 --> 00:27:48.379
hates included in the system okay but
now i go for to the more interesting

00:27:48.379 --> 00:27:48.389
now i go for to the more interesting
 

00:27:48.389 --> 00:27:52.759
now i go for to the more interesting
parts I already talked before that's the

00:27:52.759 --> 00:27:52.769
parts I already talked before that's the
 

00:27:52.769 --> 00:27:57.169
parts I already talked before that's the
categories okay the categories I told

00:27:57.169 --> 00:27:57.179
categories okay the categories I told
 

00:27:57.179 --> 00:28:00.109
categories okay the categories I told
you where our keywords from controlled

00:28:00.109 --> 00:28:00.119
you where our keywords from controlled
 

00:28:00.119 --> 00:28:04.960
you where our keywords from controlled
vocabularies and you can see here that

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:04.970
vocabularies and you can see here that
 

00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:07.759
vocabularies and you can see here that
several key words are put together in

00:28:07.759 --> 00:28:07.769
several key words are put together in
 

00:28:07.769 --> 00:28:11.359
several key words are put together in
the same cell so they are separated by

00:28:11.359 --> 00:28:11.369
the same cell so they are separated by
 

00:28:11.369 --> 00:28:14.090
the same cell so they are separated by
the pipe character here the first object

00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:14.100
the pipe character here the first object
 

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:17.239
the pipe character here the first object
is classified under botanical specimens

00:28:17.239 --> 00:28:17.249
is classified under botanical specimens
 

00:28:17.249 --> 00:28:20.899
is classified under botanical specimens
but also numismatics two different

00:28:20.899 --> 00:28:20.909
but also numismatics two different
 

00:28:20.909 --> 00:28:23.299
but also numismatics two different
keywords separated by the pipe character

00:28:23.299 --> 00:28:23.309
keywords separated by the pipe character
 

00:28:23.309 --> 00:28:28.029
keywords separated by the pipe character
so the first thing we need is to split

00:28:28.029 --> 00:28:28.039
so the first thing we need is to split
 

00:28:28.039 --> 00:28:33.499
so the first thing we need is to split
those keywords but but but at the same

00:28:33.499 --> 00:28:33.509
those keywords but but but at the same
 

00:28:33.509 --> 00:28:36.049
those keywords but but but at the same
time keeping all of them links to the

00:28:36.049 --> 00:28:36.059
time keeping all of them links to the
 

00:28:36.059 --> 00:28:39.139
time keeping all of them links to the
right object we can we can do this with

00:28:39.139 --> 00:28:39.149
right object we can we can do this with
 

00:28:39.149 --> 00:28:42.230
right object we can we can do this with
Google refine with another operation in

00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:42.240
Google refine with another operation in
 

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:44.629
Google refine with another operation in
edit cells we have splits multivalued

00:28:44.629 --> 00:28:44.639
edit cells we have splits multivalued
 

00:28:44.639 --> 00:28:50.570
edit cells we have splits multivalued
cells up I'll do this I have to select

00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:50.580
cells up I'll do this I have to select
 

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:53.779
cells up I'll do this I have to select
the right character to separate and it's

00:28:53.779 --> 00:28:53.789
the right character to separate and it's
 

00:28:53.789 --> 00:28:59.350
the right character to separate and it's
the pipe character so that's okay

00:28:59.350 --> 00:28:59.360
the pipe character so that's okay
 

00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:07.399
the pipe character so that's okay
working for a few seconds

00:29:07.399 --> 00:29:07.409
 
 

00:29:07.409 --> 00:29:13.080
 
okay that's it so whereas we have before

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:13.090
okay that's it so whereas we have before
 

00:29:13.090 --> 00:29:17.279
okay that's it so whereas we have before
we had 75 thousand objects know we have

00:29:17.279 --> 00:29:17.289
we had 75 thousand objects know we have
 

00:29:17.289 --> 00:29:20.430
we had 75 thousand objects know we have
much more routes here you can see a

00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:20.440
much more routes here you can see a
 

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:23.879
much more routes here you can see a
hundred and seventy thousands that's

00:29:23.879 --> 00:29:23.889
hundred and seventy thousands that's
 

00:29:23.889 --> 00:29:26.759
hundred and seventy thousands that's
because for a single object they can be

00:29:26.759 --> 00:29:26.769
because for a single object they can be
 

00:29:26.769 --> 00:29:29.969
because for a single object they can be
many different keywords but if we switch

00:29:29.969 --> 00:29:29.979
many different keywords but if we switch
 

00:29:29.979 --> 00:29:33.779
many different keywords but if we switch
back to the records view we still have

00:29:33.779 --> 00:29:33.789
back to the records view we still have
 

00:29:33.789 --> 00:29:37.080
back to the records view we still have
the same number of records it doesn't

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:37.090
the same number of records it doesn't
 

00:29:37.090 --> 00:29:38.789
the same number of records it doesn't
change we then didn't change anything

00:29:38.789 --> 00:29:38.799
change we then didn't change anything
 

00:29:38.799 --> 00:29:44.009
change we then didn't change anything
and the the keywords are linked to a

00:29:44.009 --> 00:29:44.019
and the the keywords are linked to a
 

00:29:44.019 --> 00:29:50.729
and the the keywords are linked to a
single object okay now the most

00:29:50.729 --> 00:29:50.739
single object okay now the most
 

00:29:50.739 --> 00:29:53.099
single object okay now the most
interesting thing is that we can have a

00:29:53.099 --> 00:29:53.109
interesting thing is that we can have a
 

00:29:53.109 --> 00:29:55.799
interesting thing is that we can have a
text facet we didn't use that yet

00:29:55.799 --> 00:29:55.809
text facet we didn't use that yet
 

00:29:55.809 --> 00:30:00.509
text facet we didn't use that yet
because we didn't use text fields if we

00:30:00.509 --> 00:30:00.519
because we didn't use text fields if we
 

00:30:00.519 --> 00:30:04.229
because we didn't use text fields if we
do a text facet we'll ask Google refine

00:30:04.229 --> 00:30:04.239
do a text facet we'll ask Google refine
 

00:30:04.239 --> 00:30:08.310
do a text facet we'll ask Google refine
to list all different values possible

00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:08.320
to list all different values possible

different keywords and they are listed
 

00:30:14.049 --> 00:30:16.889
different keywords and they are listed
here on the right there are just under

00:30:16.889 --> 00:30:16.899
here on the right there are just under
 

00:30:16.899 --> 00:30:19.249
here on the right there are just under
five thousand key words used to describe

five thousand key words used to describe
 

00:30:19.259 --> 00:30:22.320
five thousand key words used to describe
objects in this collection and we can

objects in this collection and we can
 

00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:25.200
objects in this collection and we can
sort them by count to get the more

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:25.210
sort them by count to get the more
 

00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:29.879
sort them by count to get the more
popular keywords here we can see

00:30:29.879 --> 00:30:29.889
popular keywords here we can see
 

00:30:29.889 --> 00:30:32.519
popular keywords here we can see
numismatics is the most used followed by

00:30:32.519 --> 00:30:32.529
numismatics is the most used followed by
 

00:30:32.529 --> 00:30:35.029
numismatics is the most used followed by
ceramics clothing and dress and so on

00:30:35.029 --> 00:30:35.039
ceramics clothing and dress and so on
 

00:30:35.039 --> 00:30:39.659
ceramics clothing and dress and so on
okay and there are lots of them and I

00:30:39.659 --> 00:30:39.669
okay and there are lots of them and I
 

00:30:39.669 --> 00:30:43.139
okay and there are lots of them and I
will use this cluster functionality just

00:30:43.139 --> 00:30:43.149
will use this cluster functionality just
 

00:30:43.149 --> 00:30:48.269
will use this cluster functionality just
here to see if keywords are duplicates

00:30:48.269 --> 00:30:48.279
here to see if keywords are duplicates
 

00:30:48.279 --> 00:30:50.609
here to see if keywords are duplicates
or near duplicates and that's a powerful

00:30:50.609 --> 00:30:50.619
or near duplicates and that's a powerful
 

00:30:50.619 --> 00:30:53.700
or near duplicates and that's a powerful
functionality of google refine because

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:53.710
functionality of google refine because
 

00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:56.580
functionality of google refine because
here you can see that two different

00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:56.590
here you can see that two different
 

00:30:56.590 --> 00:31:00.690
here you can see that two different
categories were used just before because

00:31:00.690 --> 00:31:00.700
categories were used just before because
 

00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:04.859
categories were used just before because
of different in case or space or

00:31:04.859 --> 00:31:04.869
of different in case or space or
 

00:31:04.869 --> 00:31:09.509
of different in case or space or
something okay and we can have a look at

00:31:09.509 --> 00:31:09.519
something okay and we can have a look at
 

00:31:09.519 --> 00:31:13.649
something okay and we can have a look at
that obviously it's always the same here

00:31:13.649 --> 00:31:13.659
that obviously it's always the same here
 

00:31:13.659 --> 00:31:16.769
that obviously it's always the same here
documents with or without capital letter

00:31:16.769 --> 00:31:16.779
documents with or without capital letter
 

00:31:16.779 --> 00:31:18.960
documents with or without capital letter
and so on and so on and

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:18.970
and so on and so on and
 

00:31:18.970 --> 00:31:23.399
and so on and so on and
that's a cat here we just diagnose a

00:31:23.399 --> 00:31:23.409
that's a cat here we just diagnose a
 

00:31:23.409 --> 00:31:26.520
that's a cat here we just diagnose a
problem but we can solve it at the same

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:26.530
problem but we can solve it at the same
 

00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:30.480
problem but we can solve it at the same
time by selecting ok I select everything

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:30.490
time by selecting ok I select everything
 

00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:34.440
time by selecting ok I select everything
and I want to merge everything together

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:34.450
and I want to merge everything together
 

00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:40.380
and I want to merge everything together
so those two different those two

00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:40.390
so those two different those two
 

00:31:40.390 --> 00:31:44.399
so those two different those two
variations will be merged to this one on

00:31:44.399 --> 00:31:44.409
variations will be merged to this one on
 

00:31:44.409 --> 00:31:46.649
variations will be merged to this one on
the right and you can change if you

00:31:46.649 --> 00:31:46.659
the right and you can change if you
 

00:31:46.659 --> 00:31:49.770
the right and you can change if you
don't like what Google refine use as the

00:31:49.770 --> 00:31:49.780
don't like what Google refine use as the
 

00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:54.240
don't like what Google refine use as the

seven thousand cells were edited so
 

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:07.169
seven thousand cells were edited so
that's cool ok and we have different

00:32:07.169 --> 00:32:07.179
that's cool ok and we have different
 

00:32:07.179 --> 00:32:11.310
that's cool ok and we have different
methods to to cluster them together we

00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:11.320
methods to to cluster them together we
 

00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:13.799
methods to to cluster them together we
can switch to another one friend for

00:32:13.799 --> 00:32:13.809
can switch to another one friend for
 

00:32:13.809 --> 00:32:16.039
can switch to another one friend for
instance and Graham fingerprints here

00:32:16.039 --> 00:32:16.049

which is more aggressive sort of and you

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:22.210
which is more aggressive sort of and you
 

00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:26.990
which is more aggressive sort of and you
yeah it's a good way to remind you that

00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:27.000
yeah it's a good way to remind you that
 

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.669
yeah it's a good way to remind you that
Google refine is the tool but you're the

00:32:29.669 --> 00:32:29.679
Google refine is the tool but you're the
 

00:32:29.679 --> 00:32:32.159
Google refine is the tool but you're the
master because we will refine can make

00:32:32.159 --> 00:32:32.169
master because we will refine can make
 

00:32:32.169 --> 00:32:37.669
master because we will refine can make
mistakes and here you have to to yeah to

00:32:37.669 --> 00:32:37.679
mistakes and here you have to to yeah to
 

00:32:37.679 --> 00:32:41.640
mistakes and here you have to to yeah to
to have a good look because if we select

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:41.650
to have a good look because if we select
 

00:32:41.650 --> 00:32:44.190
to have a good look because if we select
everything the Google refine would be

00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:44.200
everything the Google refine would be
 

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:48.270
everything the Google refine would be
making a mistake can you see that by

00:32:48.270 --> 00:32:48.280
making a mistake can you see that by
 

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:58.830
making a mistake can you see that by
merging things together don't you yeah

00:32:58.830 --> 00:32:58.840
merging things together don't you yeah
 

00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:03.060
merging things together don't you yeah
shirts and t-shirts exactly so shirts

00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:03.070
shirts and t-shirts exactly so shirts
 

00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:07.020
shirts and t-shirts exactly so shirts
and t-shirts are very similar but

00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:07.030
and t-shirts are very similar but
 

00:33:07.030 --> 00:33:10.370
and t-shirts are very similar but
obviously they're not really the same so

00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:10.380
obviously they're not really the same so
 

00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:14.520
obviously they're not really the same so
why we could argue can argue that they

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:14.530
why we could argue can argue that they
 

00:33:14.530 --> 00:33:18.390
why we could argue can argue that they
could fit in the same category but here

00:33:18.390 --> 00:33:18.400
could fit in the same category but here
 

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:20.669
could fit in the same category but here
we have two distinct categories so we

00:33:20.669 --> 00:33:20.679
we have two distinct categories so we
 

00:33:20.679 --> 00:33:23.760
we have two distinct categories so we
can select everything to merge unless

00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:23.770
can select everything to merge unless
 

00:33:23.770 --> 00:33:26.220
can select everything to merge unless
shirt and t-shirts we keep them apart

00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:26.230
shirt and t-shirts we keep them apart
 

00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:32.130
shirt and t-shirts we keep them apart
and we re cluster everything okay

00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:32.140
 
 

00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:35.920
 
moral things are merged we have even

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:35.930
moral things are merged we have even
 

00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:38.620
moral things are merged we have even
more aggressive techniques but I won't

00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:38.630
more aggressive techniques but I won't
 

00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:41.970
more aggressive techniques but I won't
use them just to show you because it's

00:33:41.970 --> 00:33:41.980
use them just to show you because it's
 

00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:47.170
use them just to show you because it's
yeah it's but thats and let us know and

00:33:47.170 --> 00:33:47.180
yeah it's but thats and let us know and
 

00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:50.850
yeah it's but thats and let us know and
things like that I have other funny

00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:50.860
things like that I have other funny
 

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:56.170
things like that I have other funny
examples I think dresses and pressor so

00:33:56.170 --> 00:33:56.180
examples I think dresses and pressor so
 

00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:58.840
examples I think dresses and pressor so
you have to be careful of course nuts to

00:33:58.840 --> 00:33:58.850
you have to be careful of course nuts to
 

00:33:58.850 --> 00:34:03.040
you have to be careful of course nuts to
let Google refine do anything the user

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:03.050
let Google refine do anything the user
 

00:34:03.050 --> 00:34:08.350
let Google refine do anything the user
has to remain and Oh what else okay

00:34:08.350 --> 00:34:08.360
has to remain and Oh what else okay
 

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:10.720

yes honey okay so I I won't be merging

00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:14.390
yes honey okay so I I won't be merging
 

00:34:14.390 --> 00:34:20.830
yes honey okay so I I won't be merging
that and here we've already reduced the

00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:20.840
that and here we've already reduced the
 

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:23.940
that and here we've already reduced the
number of categories used because we

00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:23.950
number of categories used because we
 

00:34:23.950 --> 00:34:26.909
number of categories used because we
cluster them together still of course

00:34:26.909 --> 00:34:26.919
cluster them together still of course
 

00:34:26.919 --> 00:34:31.180
cluster them together still of course
there's always the problem of having a

00:34:31.180 --> 00:34:31.190
there's always the problem of having a
 

00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:34.060
there's always the problem of having a
very specific categories used only for

00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:34.070
very specific categories used only for
 

00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:36.640
very specific categories used only for
one or two objects that's another

00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:36.650
one or two objects that's another
 

00:34:36.650 --> 00:34:39.310
one or two objects that's another
problem we can't solve anything for

00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:39.320
problem we can't solve anything for
 

00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:41.320
problem we can't solve anything for
instance here we have that's very

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:41.330
instance here we have that's very
 

00:34:41.330 --> 00:34:45.220
instance here we have that's very
interesting category toy rabbits of

00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:45.230
interesting category toy rabbits of
 

00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:48.520
interesting category toy rabbits of
course there are not so many category

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:48.530
course there are not so many category
 

00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:51.419
course there are not so many category
not so many objects in the collection

00:34:51.419 --> 00:34:51.429
not so many objects in the collection
 

00:34:51.429 --> 00:34:55.120
not so many objects in the collection
corresponding to that keyboard but it

00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:55.130
corresponding to that keyboard but it
 

00:34:55.130 --> 00:35:02.170
corresponding to that keyboard but it
should have if I run text filter I if

00:35:02.170 --> 00:35:02.180
should have if I run text filter I if
 

00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:15.310
should have if I run text filter I if
it's okay it should have fit in toy

00:35:15.310 --> 00:35:15.320
it's okay it should have fit in toy
 

00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:20.140
it's okay it should have fit in toy
animals maybe which is how more general

00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:20.150
animals maybe which is how more general
 

00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:23.910
animals maybe which is how more general
so still there there are other problems

00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:23.920
so still there there are other problems
 

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:28.720
so still there there are other problems
but the cluster functionality is a good

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:28.730
but the cluster functionality is a good
 

00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:32.440
but the cluster functionality is a good
way to have a first and very quick and

00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:32.450
way to have a first and very quick and
 

00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:34.900
way to have a first and very quick and
efficient clustering to improve the

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:34.910
efficient clustering to improve the
 

00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:38.890
efficient clustering to improve the
quality okay no I'll give the match to

00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:38.900
quality okay no I'll give the match to
 

00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:41.800
quality okay no I'll give the match to
ribbon was going to go through the next

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:41.810
ribbon was going to go through the next
 

00:35:41.810 --> 00:36:06.000
ribbon was going to go through the next

00:36:12.019 --> 00:36:15.039
Art's yet I plan to do it so what have I
been drawing here then well sadly this

00:36:15.039 --> 00:36:15.049
been drawing here then well sadly this
 

00:36:15.049 --> 00:36:17.680

is the current metadata landscape this

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:17.690
is the current metadata landscape this
 

00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:20.579
is the current metadata landscape this
is how it works now it's all islands

00:36:20.579 --> 00:36:20.589
is how it works now it's all islands
 

00:36:20.589 --> 00:36:24.250
is how it works now it's all islands
every collection is in its own Island

00:36:24.250 --> 00:36:24.260
every collection is in its own Island

there's a powerhouse museum somewhere

00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:26.630
there's a powerhouse museum somewhere
 

00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:29.680
there's a powerhouse museum somewhere
there's larger collections there are

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:29.690
there's larger collections there are
 

00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:32.890
there's larger collections there are
also smaller collections but the general

00:36:32.890 --> 00:36:32.900
also smaller collections but the general
 

00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:36.910
also smaller collections but the general
thing is they're all islands and what we

00:36:36.910 --> 00:36:36.920
thing is they're all islands and what we
 

00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:39.569
thing is they're all islands and what we
really want us as metadata people it's

00:36:39.569 --> 00:36:39.579
really want us as metadata people it's
 

00:36:39.579 --> 00:36:42.579
really want us as metadata people it's

00:36:42.579 --> 00:36:42.589
connection that it's all about it's not
 

00:36:42.589 --> 00:36:44.019
connection that it's all about it's not
about this one collection with it about

00:36:44.019 --> 00:36:44.029
about this one collection with it about
 

00:36:44.029 --> 00:36:46.599
about this one collection with it about
how those collections relate to each

00:36:46.599 --> 00:36:46.609
how those collections relate to each
 

00:36:46.609 --> 00:36:50.079
how those collections relate to each
other and am basically by just having

00:36:50.079 --> 00:36:50.089
other and am basically by just having
 

00:36:50.089 --> 00:36:54.220
other and am basically by just having
metadata cleaned up we're not yet making

00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:54.230
metadata cleaned up we're not yet making
 

00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:58.230
metadata cleaned up we're not yet making
those bridges so the next part

00:36:58.230 --> 00:36:58.240
those bridges so the next part
 

00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:00.730
those bridges so the next part
reconciliation is going to be about

00:37:00.730 --> 00:37:00.740
reconciliation is going to be about
 

00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:05.079
reconciliation is going to be about
those bridges it's going to be about how

00:37:05.079 --> 00:37:05.089
those bridges it's going to be about how
 

00:37:05.089 --> 00:37:07.569
those bridges it's going to be about how
can we use the metadata to create some

00:37:07.569 --> 00:37:07.579
can we use the metadata to create some
 

00:37:07.579 --> 00:37:10.870
can we use the metadata to create some
universal sense of meaning to create

00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:10.880
universal sense of meaning to create
 

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:12.880
universal sense of meaning to create
metadata that can be shared across

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:12.890
metadata that can be shared across
 

00:37:12.890 --> 00:37:15.730
metadata that can be shared across
different collections and the idea is

00:37:15.730 --> 00:37:15.740
different collections and the idea is
 

00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:17.710
different collections and the idea is
that we're going to use controlled

00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:17.720
that we're going to use controlled
 

00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:19.960
that we're going to use controlled
vocabulary so the vocabulary you've seen

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:19.970
vocabulary so the vocabulary you've seen
 

00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:22.930
vocabulary so the vocabulary you've seen
now was more ad hoc vocabulary used by

00:37:22.930 --> 00:37:22.940
now was more ad hoc vocabulary used by
 

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:25.450
now was more ad hoc vocabulary used by
the powerhouse museum but the porous

00:37:25.450 --> 00:37:25.460
the powerhouse museum but the porous
 

00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:27.160
the powerhouse museum but the porous
museum has its own and other museums

00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:27.170
museum has its own and other museums
 

00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:29.200
museum has its own and other museums
have have different ones so there's no

00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:29.210
have have different ones so there's no
 

00:37:29.210 --> 00:37:32.079
have have different ones so there's no
real interoperability there so what

00:37:32.079 --> 00:37:32.089
real interoperability there so what
 

00:37:32.089 --> 00:37:36.420
real interoperability there so what
we're going to use as centralized

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:36.430
we're going to use as centralized
 

00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:40.059
we're going to use as centralized
vocabulary and that is to link every

00:37:40.059 --> 00:37:40.069
vocabulary and that is to link every
 

00:37:40.069 --> 00:37:42.120
vocabulary and that is to link every
collection to that centralized

00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:42.130
collection to that centralized
 

00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:47.499
collection to that centralized
vocabulary and in that way they'll also

00:37:47.499 --> 00:37:47.509
vocabulary and in that way they'll also
 

00:37:47.509 --> 00:37:50.079
vocabulary and in that way they'll also
be linked to each other indirectly so

00:37:50.079 --> 00:37:50.089
be linked to each other indirectly so
 

00:37:50.089 --> 00:37:53.370
be linked to each other indirectly so
this is what I'm going to show you now

00:37:53.370 --> 00:37:53.380
this is what I'm going to show you now
 

00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:58.720
this is what I'm going to show you now
so practically how does that work let me

00:37:58.720 --> 00:37:58.730
so practically how does that work let me
 

00:37:58.730 --> 00:38:03.819
so practically how does that work let me
quickly go to my slides so we will fuse

00:38:03.819 --> 00:38:03.829
quickly go to my slides so we will fuse
 

00:38:03.829 --> 00:38:05.799
quickly go to my slides so we will fuse
familiar with LC SH the Library of

00:38:05.799 --> 00:38:05.809
familiar with LC SH the Library of
 

00:38:05.809 --> 00:38:08.529
familiar with LC SH the Library of
Congress subject headings you've heard

00:38:08.529 --> 00:38:08.539
Congress subject headings you've heard
 

00:38:08.539 --> 00:38:10.960
Congress subject headings you've heard
about that I assume did you hear good

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:10.970
about that I assume did you hear good
 

00:38:10.970 --> 00:38:12.509
about that I assume did you hear good
things about that bad things who says

00:38:12.509 --> 00:38:12.519
things about that bad things who says
 

00:38:12.519 --> 00:38:16.769
things about that bad things who says
okay who said it's a good thing it's

00:38:16.769 --> 00:38:16.779
okay who said it's a good thing it's
 

00:38:16.779 --> 00:38:18.530
okay who said it's a good thing it's
everybody great

00:38:18.530 --> 00:38:18.540
everybody great
 

00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:22.010
everybody great
it has some problems also controlled

00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:22.020
it has some problems also controlled
 

00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:24.470
it has some problems also controlled
vocabularies are not having yet but they

00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:24.480
vocabularies are not having yet but they
 

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:26.840
vocabularies are not having yet but they
can be really useful as I'll just show

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:26.850
can be really useful as I'll just show
 

00:38:26.850 --> 00:38:31.940
can be really useful as I'll just show
in a second so the idea of using the LOC

00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:31.950
in a second so the idea of using the LOC
 

00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:33.950
in a second so the idea of using the LOC
subject headings is not only they are

00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:33.960
subject headings is not only they are
 

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:35.450
subject headings is not only they are
controlled but they're also accessible

00:38:35.450 --> 00:38:35.460
controlled but they're also accessible
 

00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:38.030
controlled but they're also accessible
online they're freely accessible so

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:38.040
online they're freely accessible so
 

00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:39.770
online they're freely accessible so
they're both human readable but also

00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:39.780
they're both human readable but also
 

00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:41.510
they're both human readable but also
machine readable so they're also a

00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:41.520
machine readable so they're also a
 

00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:43.790
machine readable so they're also a
machine-readable format accessible

00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:43.800
machine-readable format accessible
 

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:46.400
machine-readable format accessible
online so let me maybe quickly show you

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:46.410
online so let me maybe quickly show you
 

00:38:46.410 --> 00:38:50.420
online so let me maybe quickly show you
that on them on the website so this is

00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:50.430
that on them on the website so this is
 

00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:53.720
that on them on the website so this is
the Library of Congress website and

00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:53.730
the Library of Congress website and
 

00:38:53.730 --> 00:38:55.430
the Library of Congress website and
basically you have the different subject

00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:55.440
basically you have the different subject
 

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:58.640
basically you have the different subject
headings over here and some of them are

00:38:58.640 --> 00:38:58.650
headings over here and some of them are
 

00:38:58.650 --> 00:39:00.410
headings over here and some of them are
a specific some of them are really

00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:00.420
a specific some of them are really
 

00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:02.210
a specific some of them are really
general but they all have the

00:39:02.210 --> 00:39:02.220
general but they all have the
 

00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:04.760
general but they all have the
relationship to each other so you can

00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:04.770
relationship to each other so you can
 

00:39:04.770 --> 00:39:06.740
relationship to each other so you can
know which one is it the more specific

00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:06.750
know which one is it the more specific
 

00:39:06.750 --> 00:39:09.860
know which one is it the more specific
one of another and so on and the

00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:09.870
one of another and so on and the
 

00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:12.650
one of another and so on and the
interesting thing for for us is that you

00:39:12.650 --> 00:39:12.660
interesting thing for for us is that you
 

00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:16.540
interesting thing for for us is that you
can also download the whole thing and

00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:16.550
can also download the whole thing and
 

00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:18.560
can also download the whole thing and
once it don't know that you can use it

00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:18.570
once it don't know that you can use it
 

00:39:18.570 --> 00:39:21.320
once it don't know that you can use it
to reconcile a collection using Google

00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:21.330
to reconcile a collection using Google
 

00:39:21.330 --> 00:39:24.290
to reconcile a collection using Google
refine so that's what we've done we've

00:39:24.290 --> 00:39:24.300
refine so that's what we've done we've
 

00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:28.040
refine so that's what we've done we've
downloaded it and basically the data

00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:28.050
downloaded it and basically the data
 

00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:30.470
downloaded it and basically the data
formats they've used as a semantic web

00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:30.480
formats they've used as a semantic web
 

00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:32.540
formats they've used as a semantic web
format so who's familiar with the

00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:32.550
format so who's familiar with the
 

00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:36.260
format so who's familiar with the
Semantic Web here and who sets the good

00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:36.270
Semantic Web here and who sets the good
 

00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:40.010
Semantic Web here and who sets the good
thing that's everybody again that's

00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:40.020
thing that's everybody again that's
 

00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:44.270
thing that's everybody again that's
right now so am but linked data and

00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:44.280
right now so am but linked data and
 

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:46.190
right now so am but linked data and
semantic web provide really cool tools

00:39:46.190 --> 00:39:46.200
semantic web provide really cool tools
 

00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:48.140
semantic web provide really cool tools
because they're linked together

00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:48.150
because they're linked together
 

00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:50.420
because they're linked together
similarly like collections should be

00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:50.430
similarly like collections should be
 

00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:51.950
similarly like collections should be
linked together but they're also

00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:51.960
linked together but they're also
 

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:54.890
linked together but they're also
queryable so we just put the whole and

00:39:54.890 --> 00:39:54.900
queryable so we just put the whole and
 

00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:58.250
queryable so we just put the whole and
LCS H in a database which we can query

00:39:58.250 --> 00:39:58.260
LCS H in a database which we can query
 

00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:00.530
LCS H in a database which we can query
using sparkle and sparkle is basically

00:40:00.530 --> 00:40:00.540
using sparkle and sparkle is basically
 

00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:02.600
using sparkle and sparkle is basically
the Semantic Web granular language is

00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:02.610
the Semantic Web granular language is
 

00:40:02.610 --> 00:40:07.550
the Semantic Web granular language is
like SQL for that semantic web so let me

00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:07.560
like SQL for that semantic web so let me
 

00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:12.590
like SQL for that semantic web so let me
go back to Google refine and I'll just

00:40:12.590 --> 00:40:12.600
go back to Google refine and I'll just
 

00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:15.140
go back to Google refine and I'll just
use a small clean subset of the power

00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:15.150
use a small clean subset of the power
 

00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:17.120
use a small clean subset of the power
museum collection so this is the

00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:17.130
museum collection so this is the
 

00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:18.620
museum collection so this is the
collection after it has been cleaned

00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:18.630
collection after it has been cleaned
 

00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:22.460
collection after it has been cleaned
using the steps max has shown and

00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:22.470
using the steps max has shown and
 

00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:24.440
using the steps max has shown and
basically here we're interested in the

00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:24.450
basically here we're interested in the
 

00:40:24.450 --> 00:40:26.420
basically here we're interested in the
categories field of course because this

00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:26.430
categories field of course because this
 

00:40:26.430 --> 00:40:28.280
categories field of course because this
is the field that other items and other

00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:28.290
is the field that other items and other
 

00:40:28.290 --> 00:40:30.080
is the field that other items and other
collections are also going to have so

00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:30.090
collections are also going to have so
 

00:40:30.090 --> 00:40:32.359
collections are also going to have so
it's this field we're going to

00:40:32.359 --> 00:40:32.369
it's this field we're going to
 

00:40:32.369 --> 00:40:34.819
it's this field we're going to
reconcile to this centralized controlled

00:40:34.819 --> 00:40:34.829
reconcile to this centralized controlled
 

00:40:34.829 --> 00:40:38.420
reconcile to this centralized controlled
vocabulary how does it work well what I

00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:38.430
vocabulary how does it work well what I
 

00:40:38.430 --> 00:40:42.529
vocabulary how does it work well what I
did before is I added the LCS H database

00:40:42.529 --> 00:40:42.539
did before is I added the LCS H database
 

00:40:42.539 --> 00:40:46.640
did before is I added the LCS H database
the sparkle database to the system on

00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:46.650
the sparkle database to the system on
 

00:40:46.650 --> 00:40:48.049
the sparkle database to the system on
the website are the details on how you

00:40:48.049 --> 00:40:48.059
the website are the details on how you
 

00:40:48.059 --> 00:40:49.549
the website are the details on how you
can do it yourself but it's all

00:40:49.549 --> 00:40:49.559
can do it yourself but it's all
 

00:40:49.559 --> 00:40:51.109
can do it yourself but it's all
technical stuff so I won't bother you

00:40:51.109 --> 00:40:51.119
technical stuff so I won't bother you
 

00:40:51.119 --> 00:40:54.079
technical stuff so I won't bother you
with it but the important thing is that

00:40:54.079 --> 00:40:54.089
with it but the important thing is that
 

00:40:54.089 --> 00:40:56.269
with it but the important thing is that
it's really easy to reconcile so I just

00:40:56.269 --> 00:40:56.279
it's really easy to reconcile so I just
 

00:40:56.279 --> 00:40:58.279
it's really easy to reconcile so I just
go up to categories and I choose

00:40:58.279 --> 00:40:58.289
go up to categories and I choose
 

00:40:58.289 --> 00:41:01.579
go up to categories and I choose
reconcile starter I concerning and then

00:41:01.579 --> 00:41:01.589
reconcile starter I concerning and then
 

00:41:01.589 --> 00:41:04.249
reconcile starter I concerning and then
I choose from which to which M

00:41:04.249 --> 00:41:04.259
I choose from which to which M
 

00:41:04.259 --> 00:41:05.989
I choose from which to which M
centralized vocabulary I want to

00:41:05.989 --> 00:41:05.999
centralized vocabulary I want to
 

00:41:05.999 --> 00:41:08.319
centralized vocabulary I want to
reconcile in this case the LCS h and

00:41:08.319 --> 00:41:08.329
reconcile in this case the LCS h and
 

00:41:08.329 --> 00:41:11.059
reconcile in this case the LCS h and
what is doing no it's basically scanning

00:41:11.059 --> 00:41:11.069
what is doing no it's basically scanning
 

00:41:11.069 --> 00:41:12.440
what is doing no it's basically scanning
through all the different types i have

00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:12.450
through all the different types i have
 

00:41:12.450 --> 00:41:14.509
through all the different types i have
and based on that it will guess what

00:41:14.509 --> 00:41:14.519
and based on that it will guess what
 

00:41:14.519 --> 00:41:16.819
and based on that it will guess what
kind of elements and working with in

00:41:16.819 --> 00:41:16.829
kind of elements and working with in
 

00:41:16.829 --> 00:41:18.440
kind of elements and working with in
this case I'm indeed working with

00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:18.450
this case I'm indeed working with
 

00:41:18.450 --> 00:41:21.009
this case I'm indeed working with
concepts of course concepts and

00:41:21.009 --> 00:41:21.019
concepts of course concepts and
 

00:41:21.019 --> 00:41:23.989
concepts of course concepts and
basically this is it so now it has a

00:41:23.989 --> 00:41:23.999
basically this is it so now it has a
 

00:41:23.999 --> 00:41:26.059
basically this is it so now it has a
term and what to do and now i take the

00:41:26.059 --> 00:41:26.069
term and what to do and now i take the
 

00:41:26.069 --> 00:41:29.809
term and what to do and now i take the
start reconciling button and it just

00:41:29.809 --> 00:41:29.819
start reconciling button and it just
 

00:41:29.819 --> 00:41:32.269
start reconciling button and it just
does what it has to do and one thing you

00:41:32.269 --> 00:41:32.279
does what it has to do and one thing you
 

00:41:32.279 --> 00:41:33.650
does what it has to do and one thing you
should notice is that's going really

00:41:33.650 --> 00:41:33.660
should notice is that's going really
 

00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:36.529
should notice is that's going really
fast to imagine having to do this all by

00:41:36.529 --> 00:41:36.539
fast to imagine having to do this all by
 

00:41:36.539 --> 00:41:38.930
fast to imagine having to do this all by
yourself on many will I mean my laptop

00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:38.940
yourself on many will I mean my laptop
 

00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:40.670

is currently standing on the LCS stage I

00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:40.680
is currently standing on the LCS stage I
 

00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:42.259

know if you can see it but those big

00:41:42.259 --> 00:41:42.269
know if you can see it but those big
 

00:41:42.269 --> 00:41:45.349
know if you can see it but those big
books are the full thing so if you have

00:41:45.349 --> 00:41:45.359
books are the full thing so if you have
 

00:41:45.359 --> 00:41:47.539
books are the full thing so if you have
to do many buddy you'd spend hours on

00:41:47.539 --> 00:41:47.549
to do many buddy you'd spend hours on
 

00:41:47.549 --> 00:41:49.880
to do many buddy you'd spend hours on
that but no look it's it's already done

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:49.890
that but no look it's it's already done
 

00:41:49.890 --> 00:41:52.579
that but no look it's it's already done
in fact oh and what's the difference

00:41:52.579 --> 00:41:52.589
in fact oh and what's the difference
 

00:41:52.589 --> 00:41:55.970
in fact oh and what's the difference
well for example em a few minutes ago

00:41:55.970 --> 00:41:55.980
well for example em a few minutes ago
 

00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:58.160
well for example em a few minutes ago
there was also botanical specimens here

00:41:58.160 --> 00:41:58.170
there was also botanical specimens here
 

00:41:58.170 --> 00:42:00.620
there was also botanical specimens here
but it was in black know it and blue

00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:00.630
but it was in black know it and blue
 

00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:03.650
but it was in black know it and blue
it's linked actually so the thing is if

00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:03.660
it's linked actually so the thing is if
 

00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:07.819
it's linked actually so the thing is if
I click on this I go to the botanical

00:42:07.819 --> 00:42:07.829
I click on this I go to the botanical
 

00:42:07.829 --> 00:42:10.220
I click on this I go to the botanical
specimens webpage and what's the

00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:10.230
specimens webpage and what's the
 

00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:12.349
specimens webpage and what's the
difference well a few minutes ago

00:42:12.349 --> 00:42:12.359
difference well a few minutes ago
 

00:42:12.359 --> 00:42:14.779
difference well a few minutes ago
botanical specimens was only a text and

00:42:14.779 --> 00:42:14.789
botanical specimens was only a text and
 

00:42:14.789 --> 00:42:17.210
botanical specimens was only a text and
it had meaning to us because you

00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:17.220
it had meaning to us because you
 

00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:19.430
it had meaning to us because you
understand English but machines don't

00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:19.440
understand English but machines don't
 

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:22.279
understand English but machines don't
but thanks to this link it no also means

00:42:22.279 --> 00:42:22.289
but thanks to this link it no also means
 

00:42:22.289 --> 00:42:24.799
but thanks to this link it no also means
something to machines it not just let us

00:42:24.799 --> 00:42:24.809
something to machines it not just let us
 

00:42:24.809 --> 00:42:27.739
something to machines it not just let us
be OT and so on it's really disk a

00:42:27.739 --> 00:42:27.749
be OT and so on it's really disk a
 

00:42:27.749 --> 00:42:30.109
be OT and so on it's really disk a
degree of LCS h and this category is

00:42:30.109 --> 00:42:30.119
degree of LCS h and this category is
 

00:42:30.119 --> 00:42:32.630
degree of LCS h and this category is
also used by other fur and vocabularies

00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:32.640
also used by other fur and vocabularies
 

00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:34.729
also used by other fur and vocabularies
and by other collections so this is a

00:42:34.729 --> 00:42:34.739
and by other collections so this is a
 

00:42:34.739 --> 00:42:36.979
and by other collections so this is a
whole world of difference and this will

00:42:36.979 --> 00:42:36.989
whole world of difference and this will
 

00:42:36.989 --> 00:42:38.989
whole world of difference and this will
actually enable the coupling and the

00:42:38.989 --> 00:42:38.999
actually enable the coupling and the
 

00:42:38.999 --> 00:42:41.059
actually enable the coupling and the
interaction of different collections

00:42:41.059 --> 00:42:41.069
interaction of different collections
 

00:42:41.069 --> 00:42:44.150
interaction of different collections
together and this is it so this was

00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:44.160
together and this is it so this was
 

00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:45.710
together and this is it so this was
really really fast and

00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:45.720
really really fast and
 

00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:48.410
really really fast and
this is really powerful so don't be

00:42:48.410 --> 00:42:48.420
this is really powerful so don't be
 

00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:51.320
this is really powerful so don't be
misled by the speeds Google refine

00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:51.330
misled by the speeds Google refine
 

00:42:51.330 --> 00:42:53.120
misled by the speeds Google refine
because because this is really an

00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:53.130
because because this is really an
 

00:42:53.130 --> 00:42:55.400
because because this is really an
important concept if you want to do the

00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:55.410
important concept if you want to do the
 

00:42:55.410 --> 00:42:56.960
important concept if you want to do the
integration thing and I think this is

00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:56.970
integration thing and I think this is
 

00:42:56.970 --> 00:43:02.599
integration thing and I think this is
what we all should be working towards so

00:43:02.599 --> 00:43:02.609
what we all should be working towards so
 

00:43:02.609 --> 00:43:21.080
what we all should be working towards so

reconciliation that user will also find
the records with Argentina so that's

00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:34.560
the records with Argentina so that's
 

00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:36.680
the records with Argentina so that's
really a fundamental aspect of this

00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:36.690
really a fundamental aspect of this
 

00:44:36.690 --> 00:44:40.910
really a fundamental aspect of this
whole reconciliation process but so all

00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:40.920
whole reconciliation process but so all
 

00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:43.490
whole reconciliation process but so all

the same steps on the data set of the

00:45:04.530 --> 00:45:04.540
the same steps on the data set of the
 

00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:06.660
the same steps on the data set of the
powerhouse museum so here you have a

00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:06.670
powerhouse museum so here you have a
 

00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:09.300
powerhouse museum so here you have a
very detailed explanation of all of

00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:09.310
very detailed explanation of all of
 

00:45:09.310 --> 00:45:11.190
very detailed explanation of all of
these steps and we've been really glad

00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:11.200
these steps and we've been really glad
 

00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:13.980
these steps and we've been really glad
that different people have been using

00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:13.990
that different people have been using
 

00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:16.230
that different people have been using
these sets within their metadata classes

00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:16.240
these sets within their metadata classes
 

00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:20.510
these sets within their metadata classes
or within universities with students and

also regarding the reconciliation here

00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:26.590
also regarding the reconciliation here
 

00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:28.860
also regarding the reconciliation here
also again you have all the different

00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:28.870
also again you have all the different
 

00:45:28.870 --> 00:45:31.880
also again you have all the different
steps this can be a bit more technical

00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:31.890
steps this can be a bit more technical
 

00:45:31.890 --> 00:45:36.840
steps this can be a bit more technical
especially regarding the identifying the

00:45:36.850 --> 00:45:41.010
especially regarding the identifying the
LCS age as a reconciliation source but

00:45:41.010 --> 00:45:41.020
LCS age as a reconciliation source but
 

00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:43.530
LCS age as a reconciliation source but
as you perhaps already or also saw

00:45:43.530 --> 00:45:43.540
as you perhaps already or also saw
 

00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:45.360
as you perhaps already or also saw
within the interface you could also just

00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:45.370
within the interface you could also just
 

00:45:45.370 --> 00:45:47.700
within the interface you could also just
easily take for example dbpedia or I

00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:47.710
easily take for example dbpedia or I
 

00:45:47.710 --> 00:45:49.890

are just default reconciliation short
 

00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:55.320
are just default reconciliation short
sources which you can just you can just

00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:55.330
sources which you can just you can just
 

00:45:55.330 --> 00:45:57.900
sources which you can just you can just
take a box next to them and then see for

00:45:57.900 --> 00:45:57.910
take a box next to them and then see for
 

00:45:57.910 --> 00:46:01.440

example so with the powerhouse data

00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:01.450
example so with the powerhouse data
 

00:46:01.450 --> 00:46:03.630
example so with the powerhouse data
collection we had eighty percent of

00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:03.640
collection we had eighty percent of
 

00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:06.210
collection we had eighty percent of
reconciliation success but you could

00:46:06.210 --> 00:46:06.220
reconciliation success but you could
 

00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:08.010
reconciliation success but you could
also have a look at what happens for

00:46:08.010 --> 00:46:08.020
also have a look at what happens for
 

00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:11.220
also have a look at what happens for
example if you try to reconcile those

00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:11.230
example if you try to reconcile those
 

00:46:11.230 --> 00:46:14.100
example if you try to reconcile those
terms with for example dbpedia or

00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:14.110
terms with for example dbpedia or
 

00:46:14.110 --> 00:46:20.550
terms with for example dbpedia or
freebase so those were probably the most

00:46:20.550 --> 00:46:20.560
freebase so those were probably the most
 

00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:24.870
freebase so those were probably the most
important steps to have a look at so for

00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:24.880
important steps to have a look at so for
 

00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:27.150
important steps to have a look at so for
us as researchers it's very important to

00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:27.160

they are using authority Authority files
 

00:46:59.970 --> 00:47:03.870
they are using authority Authority files
in a very detailed manner so probably

00:47:03.870 --> 00:47:03.880
in a very detailed manner so probably
 

00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:06.300
in a very detailed manner so probably
over the next few months will develop a

00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:06.310
over the next few months will develop a
 

00:47:06.310 --> 00:47:09.130
over the next few months will develop a
case study based upon their date

00:47:09.130 --> 00:47:09.140
case study based upon their date
 

00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:10.930
case study based upon their date
but that will mainly focus on the

00:47:10.930 --> 00:47:10.940
but that will mainly focus on the
 

00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:13.210
but that will mainly focus on the
reconciliation especially for the

00:47:13.210 --> 00:47:13.220
reconciliation especially for the
 

00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:15.400
reconciliation especially for the
metadata cleaning part really still

00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:15.410
metadata cleaning part really still
 

00:47:15.410 --> 00:47:18.009
metadata cleaning part really still
looking for probably we should just

00:47:18.009 --> 00:47:18.019
looking for probably we should just
 

00:47:18.019 --> 00:47:19.809
looking for probably we should just

made the data will get the t-shirts or I

00:47:24.910 --> 00:47:24.920
made the data will get the t-shirts or I
 

00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:29.410
made the data will get the t-shirts or I
don't know will will get a price or para

00:47:29.410 --> 00:47:29.420
don't know will will get a price or para
 

00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:32.620
don't know will will get a price or para
but so this was really kind of a very

00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:32.630
but so this was really kind of a very
 

00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:34.809
but so this was really kind of a very
global approach of what's the project

00:47:34.809 --> 00:47:34.819
global approach of what's the project
 

00:47:34.819 --> 00:47:36.789
global approach of what's the project
about what's the whole methodology and

00:47:36.789 --> 00:47:36.799
about what's the whole methodology and
 

00:47:36.799 --> 00:47:38.859
about what's the whole methodology and
then now for us one of the more

00:47:38.859 --> 00:47:38.869
then now for us one of the more
 

00:47:38.869 --> 00:47:40.900
then now for us one of the more
interesting parts of getting here to the

00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:40.910
interesting parts of getting here to the
 

00:47:40.910 --> 00:47:43.420
interesting parts of getting here to the
US and to Colombia would be really to

00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:43.430
US and to Colombia would be really to
 

00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:46.599

00:47:48.769 --> 00:47:50.730
mythology or Google refiner the whole
reconciliation approach could be

00:47:50.730 --> 00:47:50.740
reconciliation approach could be
 

00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:55.450
reconciliation approach could be
valuable towards you so I would be more

00:47:55.450 --> 00:47:55.460
valuable towards you so I would be more
 

00:47:55.460 --> 00:47:57.609
valuable towards you so I would be more
than happy to just I don't know in which

than happy to just I don't know in which
 

00:47:57.619 --> 00:48:01.740
than happy to just I don't know in which
form it we could organize the discussion

00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:01.750
form it we could organize the discussion
 

00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:05.410
form it we could organize the discussion

have some specific questions regarding
 

00:48:07.039 --> 00:48:16.930
have some specific questions regarding
the cleaning or the reconciliation yes

exactly it's the perrito law that with

00:48:55.540 --> 00:48:55.550
exactly it's the perrito law that with
 

00:48:55.550 --> 00:49:00.640
exactly it's the perrito law that with
eighty percent we get eighty percent of

00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:00.650
eighty percent we get eighty percent of
 

00:49:00.650 --> 00:49:06.000
eighty percent we get eighty percent of
your results with twenty percent of what

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:06.010
 
 

00:49:06.010 --> 00:49:08.680

that we would have managed to get to to
 

00:50:00.799 --> 00:50:02.680
that we would have managed to get to to
that level but so just having a

this whole project is kind of based on a
paper we've written over the summer

00:50:47.110 --> 00:50:47.120
paper we've written over the summer
 

00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:50.260

which is currently in review but so here

00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:50.270
which is currently in review but so here

in this paper you'll find the whole
 

00:50:51.590 --> 00:50:55.870
in this paper you'll find the whole
methodology which we used to analyze the

00:50:57.490 --> 00:50:57.500
the quality of the wii conciliation
 

00:50:57.500 --> 00:51:01.150
the quality of the wii conciliation
process so the first thing we did is

00:51:01.150 --> 00:51:01.160
process so the first thing we did is
 

00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:04.000
process so the first thing we did is
just to take a big sample so i

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:04.010
just to take a big sample so i
 

00:51:04.010 --> 00:51:07.390
just to take a big sample so i

office the to really have a look at to
 

00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:16.510
office the to really have a look at to
see i really expected to find a lot of

00:51:16.510 --> 00:51:16.520
see i really expected to find a lot of
 

00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:19.300

to bali see me but for the five four or

00:51:25.630 --> 00:51:25.640
to bali see me but for the five four or
 

00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:31.270

five hundred records which i manually

00:51:31.270 --> 00:51:31.280
five hundred records which i manually
 

00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:34.270
five hundred records which i manually
analyzed no single records provided a

false match so I really expected to find

00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:37.930
false match so I really expected to find
 

00:51:37.930 --> 00:51:46.960
false match so I really expected to find
examples of what's a policy name for

00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:46.970
examples of what's a policy name for
 

00:51:46.970 --> 00:51:52.300
examples of what's a policy name for
example ha there's an example in the

woods the park but the huge advantage of

00:52:05.140 --> 00:52:05.150
woods the park but the huge advantage of
 

00:52:05.150 --> 00:52:09.070
woods the park but the huge advantage of
the LCS a LCEs H is that they never use

00:52:09.070 --> 00:52:09.080
the LCS a LCEs H is that they never use
 

00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:11.500
the LCS a LCEs H is that they never use
any ambiguous terms within their

00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:11.510
any ambiguous terms within their
 

00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:13.510
any ambiguous terms within their
collection so from the moment on that

00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:13.520
collection so from the moment on that
 

00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:16.120
collection so from the moment on that
you have a match it's also a

you have a match it's also a

you have a match it's also a
disadvantage in the sense that for a lot

very easy to reconcile like cup a cup

00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:24.830
very easy to reconcile like cup a cup
 

00:52:24.830 --> 00:52:27.370
very easy to reconcile like cup a cup
wasn't reconciled because cup in a way

00:52:27.370 --> 00:52:27.380
wasn't reconciled because cup in a way

when I was analyzing these 500 terms I
 

00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:40.269
when I was analyzing these 500 terms I
just I wasn't able I in a way I was very

just I wasn't able I in a way I was very
 

00:52:40.279 --> 00:52:42.099
just I wasn't able I in a way I was very
disappointed because I hope to find some

00:52:42.099 --> 00:52:42.109
disappointed because I hope to find some
 

00:52:42.109 --> 00:52:45.400
disappointed because I hope to find some
rare examples to just to prove that

00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:45.410
rare examples to just to prove that
 

00:52:45.410 --> 00:52:48.729
rare examples to just to prove that
there were sometimes some some

00:52:48.729 --> 00:52:48.739
there were sometimes some some
 

00:52:48.739 --> 00:52:50.349
there were sometimes some some
misunderstandings but I was completely

00:52:50.349 --> 00:52:50.359
misunderstandings but I was completely
 

00:52:50.359 --> 00:52:53.289
misunderstandings but I was completely
unable to find a record with which was

00:52:53.289 --> 00:52:53.299
unable to find a record with which was
 

00:52:53.299 --> 00:52:55.450
unable to find a record with which was
falsely matched so that was the first

00:52:55.450 --> 00:52:55.460
falsely matched so that was the first

00:52:58.539 --> 00:52:58.549
approach just a manual a look up and

approach just a manual a look up and
then Ruben worked on a kind of a

00:53:02.499 --> 00:53:02.509
then Ruben worked on a kind of a
 

00:53:02.509 --> 00:53:07.390
then Ruben worked on a kind of a
methodology to see how deeply the the

00:53:07.390 --> 00:53:07.400
methodology to see how deeply the the
 

00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:09.400
methodology to see how deeply the the
terms are actually matched I think we

00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:09.410
terms are actually matched I think we
 

00:53:09.410 --> 00:53:11.259
terms are actually matched I think we
would all agree that if we just speak

00:53:11.259 --> 00:53:11.269
would all agree that if we just speak
 

00:53:11.269 --> 00:53:15.400
would all agree that if we just speak
about terms like church or woods or a

00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:15.410
about terms like church or woods or a
 

00:53:15.410 --> 00:53:17.950
about terms like church or woods or a
table and you manage to reconcile that

00:53:17.950 --> 00:53:17.960
table and you manage to reconcile that
 

00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:20.319

all librarians would say are okay fair

00:53:20.319 --> 00:53:20.329
all librarians would say are okay fair
 

00:53:20.329 --> 00:53:24.190
all librarians would say are okay fair
enough but even if you with automatic

00:53:24.190 --> 00:53:24.200
enough but even if you with automatic
 

00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:27.220
enough but even if you with automatic
image recognition probably machine can

image recognition probably machine can
detect a person or like low level

semantics within an image or in a
 

00:53:31.279 --> 00:53:34.960
semantics within an image or in a

00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:34.970
document but so we developed this method
 

00:53:34.970 --> 00:53:37.150

to see how deeply embedded within the

to see how deeply embedded within the
 

00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:42.479
to see how deeply embedded within the
structure of LCS h-word the terms

00:53:42.479 --> 00:53:42.489
 
 

00:53:42.489 --> 00:53:46.599
 
reconciled to really see that a lot of

reconciled to really see that a lot of
 

00:53:46.609 --> 00:53:48.819
reconciled to really see that a lot of
these terms and for example rabbits what

00:53:48.819 --> 00:53:48.829
these terms and for example rabbits what
 

00:53:48.829 --> 00:53:51.789
these terms and for example rabbits what
was it rabbit toy you really have lots

00:53:51.789 --> 00:53:51.799
was it rabbit toy you really have lots
 

00:53:51.799 --> 00:53:56.140
was it rabbit toy you really have lots
of extremely detailed semantics which

00:53:56.140 --> 00:53:56.150
of extremely detailed semantics which
 

00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:58.630
of extremely detailed semantics which
have been reconciled if you want to have

00:53:58.630 --> 00:53:58.640
have been reconciled if you want to have
 

00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:00.489
have been reconciled if you want to have
more kind of details on that whole

00:54:00.489 --> 00:54:00.499
more kind of details on that whole
 

00:54:00.499 --> 00:54:02.950
more kind of details on that whole
methodology just have a look at paper

00:54:02.950 --> 00:54:02.960
methodology just have a look at paper
 

00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:06.249
methodology just have a look at paper
which is online on on the website it's a

00:54:06.249 --> 00:54:06.259
which is online on on the website it's a
 

00:54:06.259 --> 00:54:09.130
which is online on on the website it's a
very important question how to analyze

00:54:09.130 --> 00:54:09.140
very important question how to analyze
 

00:54:09.140 --> 00:54:11.170
very important question how to analyze
the quality of the reconciliation in a

00:54:11.170 --> 00:54:11.180
the quality of the reconciliation in a
 

00:54:11.180 --> 00:54:15.700
the quality of the reconciliation in a
way it's kind of just very populist to

00:54:15.700 --> 00:54:15.710
way it's kind of just very populist to
 

00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:17.319
way it's kind of just very populist to
say are we managed to reconcile eighty

00:54:17.319 --> 00:54:17.329
say are we managed to reconcile eighty
 

00:54:17.329 --> 00:54:20.739
say are we managed to reconcile eighty
percent it's a very important questions

00:54:20.739 --> 00:54:20.749
percent it's a very important questions
 

00:54:20.749 --> 00:54:22.539
percent it's a very important questions
from those eighty percent are we

00:54:22.539 --> 00:54:22.549
from those eighty percent are we
 

00:54:22.549 --> 00:54:24.759
from those eighty percent are we
speaking about important terms or just

00:54:24.759 --> 00:54:24.769
speaking about important terms or just
 

00:54:24.769 --> 00:54:27.099
speaking about important terms or just
about low level semantics but in this

00:54:27.099 --> 00:54:27.109
about low level semantics but in this
 

00:54:27.109 --> 00:54:29.140
about low level semantics but in this
case study we really found out that a

00:54:29.140 --> 00:54:29.150
case study we really found out that a
 

00:54:29.150 --> 00:54:31.630
case study we really found out that a
lot of the the reconcile terms were

00:54:31.630 --> 00:54:31.640
lot of the the reconcile terms were
 

00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:34.269
lot of the the reconcile terms were
actually very useful for information

00:54:34.269 --> 00:54:34.279
actually very useful for information
 

00:54:34.279 --> 00:54:38.920
actually very useful for information

which I can reuse so that would be kind

00:58:50.699 --> 00:58:50.709
which I can reuse so that would be kind
 

00:58:50.709 --> 00:58:53.789
which I can reuse so that would be kind
of an added value towards catalogers but

00:58:53.789 --> 00:58:53.799
of an added value towards catalogers but
 

00:58:53.799 --> 00:58:56.309
of an added value towards catalogers but
uh so over the next two to three months

00:58:56.309 --> 00:58:56.319
uh so over the next two to three months
 

00:58:56.319 --> 00:58:59.309

that all of these kind of steps would be
 

00:59:50.380 --> 00:59:53.489
that all of these kind of steps would be
of immediate use their collection and if

data quality methodologies or steps and
 

01:00:05.670 --> 01:00:09.179
data quality methodologies or steps and
if so how have you done them or

01:00:09.179 --> 01:00:09.189
if so how have you done them or
 

01:00:09.189 --> 01:00:12.870
