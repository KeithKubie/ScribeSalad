00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:05.800
UNDERNEATH THIS CANADIAN FOREST IS AN EXPANSIVE NETWORK OF CAVES,

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.540
THAT, UNTIL RECENTLY, HAS
NEVER BEEN SEEN BY HUMANS.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.820
THESE RESEARCHERS ARE BRAVING PRECARIOUS AND
CLAUSTROPHOBIC PASSAGEWAYS THIRTY FEET DEEP

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.740
IN THE EARTH&nbsp;— ALL IN A RACE TO DISCOVER
WHAT COULD SAVE MILLIONS OF OUR LIVES.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.740
ANN: You plunge yourself down into totally
pitch darkness.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.260
You can't even see your own hand.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.220
I have to confess here  that I have to turn my brain off,

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.120
so that I wouldn't imagine the
worst that could happen in the cave.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.620
I don't like caves, yeah... but I'm doing it for work.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:02.260
These soda straws are speleothems, which basically
means secondary mineral deposits.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:08.380
We thought the formation was caused by physical
and chemical interaction, but actually now

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:14.180
everywhere we look we see lots of bacteria
living in this soda straw formation.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:24.120
Each year, this grows only maybe 1 mm or smaller,
so these formations could be

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.040
500 years old or longer.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.540
A thousand years, this length.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:32.300
Or more.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.240
DR. NAOWARAT CHEEPTHAM, OR "ANN," IS COMBING THE IRON CURTAIN CAVE - AND OTHER CAVES -

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.299
FOR A NEW ANTIBIOTIC THAT CAN FIGHT
THE QUICKLY SWELLING CRISIS

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.580
OF DRUG-RESISTANT SUPERBUGS.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.880
ANN: If we go into a hospital these days,
some of us might not come back.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.360
I mean, I’m sorry but it’s that dire, 
the situation right now.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.080
We don’t have enough antibiotics in our
toolbox to actually fight against these infections.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.180
WHAT WOULD A WORLD WITHOUT EFFECTIVE ANTIBIOTICS REALLY LOOK LIKE?

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.500
MORE LIKE THE DARK AGES.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.280
SURGERIES ARE FAR MORE DANGEROUS.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.440
CHILDBIRTH MORTALITY RATES SOAR.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.099
TRAVEL BETWEEN COUNTRIES IS TOO RISKY, DUE
TO OUTBREAKS.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.500
BY 2050, THERE WILL BE TEN MILLION DEATHS
A YEAR FROM DRUG-RESISTANT INFECTIONS...

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.980
MORE THAN THE ANNUAL NUMBER
OF DEATHS FROM CANCER.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.800
AND IT’S HAPPENING BECAUSE OUR ONLY ANTIBIOTICS, MOST OF WHICH

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.480
ARE OVER THIRTY YEARS OLD, CAN
NO LONGER OUTSMART INFECTIOUS BACTERIA.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.200
ANN: Bacteria are way smarter than us.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.420
They adapt so quickly, and they
are very resourceful as well.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.940
Every life on earth, we want to survive.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.120
Bacteria are just like us in that sense. 
They want to survive.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.180
There will be one or two of them that are
strong enough, and stronger than the drug

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.760
that we put in, that they can still survive, 
and then they will multiply.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.680
Basically this is the the law of nature, that
you have these antibiotic-resistant

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.300
groups of bacteria.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.240
WHICH MEANS, EVEN IF ANN FINDS THE NEXT ANTIBIOTIC, ONE DAY,

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.860
BACTERIA WILL BECOME RESISTANT TO IT AGAIN.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.560
BUT A NEW DRUG WOULD STILL BUY US TIME.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.840
AND WITH OVER ONE TRILLION MICROBIAL SPECIES
YET TO BE DISCOVERED,

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.380
ANN HAS TO START SOMEWHERE.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.820
THE IRON CURTAIN CAVE ECOSYSTEM IS SO RICH
WITH LIFE BRAND NEW TO SCIENCE

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.620
THAT THERE’S HOPE AT LEAST ONE SPECIES COULD HOLD THE FORMULA FOR A NEW DRUG.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.960
ANN: The bacteria themselves are not truly
antibiotics in that sense,

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.540
but it is their metabolites that they produce.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.740
We use these molecules as our antibiotics and

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.760
basically the source of antibiotics and new drugs.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.520
SECONDARY METABOLITES ARE BIOLOGICALLY ACTIVE
SMALL MOLECULES THAT HAVE OFTEN

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.900
BEEN THE SOURCE OF MEDICINE IN THE PAST.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.060
THEY ARE A BY-PRODUCT OF BACTERIA, NOT REQUIRED FOR SURVIVAL,

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.700
BUT FOR A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE AGAINST OTHER SPECIES.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.920
HOWEVER, ANN AND OTHER RESEARCHERS THINK SECONDARY METABOLITES

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.260
COULD SERVE AN ADDITIONAL PURPOSE.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:09.310
ANN: I think there is more evidence now that
these types of metabolites that they produce

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:16.630
during their life cycle are used as a tool
for communication within themselves,

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:22.160
within their own species, and also between other
species as well.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:29.889
Instead of killing each other off and using
a competitive mode of living, wouldn’t it

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:36.819
be more beneficial for their own community
to actually communicate and work together,

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:38.900
to achieve the same goal of surviving?

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:45.550
With that said, we want to look deeper
into whether they produce certain kinds of

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.860
metabolites what we could use for our benefit.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.900
UNDERSTANDING ANY DETAILS LIKE THESE ABOUT
BACTERIA’S BEHAVIOR OR THEIR ENVIRONMENT

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.880
COULD HELP IN ANN’S QUEST FOR A NEW ANTIBIOTIC.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.280
AND AS IF THAT TASK WASN’T 
MONUMENTAL ENOUGH,

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.200
CAVE ENVIRONMENTS ARE FACING A NEW THREAT,

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.680
THAT, IF IT CONTINUES, COULD THROW ANN’S MEDICINAL RESEARCH OFF-COURSE.

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:15.720
ANN: I never planned to study with bats, but
I can see that it is important, and as a microbiologist,

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.740
I feel responsible.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.080
ANN HAS ADDED THE PLIGHT OF BATS TO HER RESEARCH, BECAUSE OF AN EPIDEMIC

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.680
CALLED WHITE NOSE SYNDROME.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.660
THIS FUNGAL INFECTION HAS ALREADY KILLED SIX
MILLION BATS IN NORTH AMERICA.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.419
WITHOUT BATS, CAVE ECOSYSTEMS WILL CHANGE.

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:34.280
AND THAT COULD BE A PROBLEM FOR FINDING THE
NEXT ANTIBIOTIC.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:39.960
AND EVEN THOUGH ANN IS A MICROBIOLOGIST, SHE
SEES THE ROLE OF BATS IN THE BIGGER PICTURE.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:46.990
ANN: Can you imagine, it’s just like you
look at this thousand piece puzzle, and bats

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:51.490
may be contributing to just one small piece
of that puzzle.

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:57.550
But if this piece of puzzle actually gets
lost, the whole puzzle will never be complete

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.520
in the same way.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:05.340
We need to be careful with our heads,
and also our hands... we have to make sure

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:13.660
we are not touching or breaking the mineral
deposits that the cave has.

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:19.880
ANN IS LOOKING FOR SODA STRAW SPELEOTHEMS
MADE OF CALCIUM CARBONATE OR CALCIUM SULFATE.

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:24.849
IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE IMPACT OF CALCIUM’S
POSITIVELY CHARGED IONS BETWEEN BACTERIA DNA

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:27.680
STRANDS COULD BE THE KEY TO KILLING BACTERIA.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:34.880
ANN: We would like to take soda straw, popcorn,
and then some samples,

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.280
especially from the octopus room.

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.660
And we would like to set up an experiment there.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.440
ANN’S RESEARCH IN THE IRON CURTAIN CAVE
HAS HAD PROMISING RESULTS SO FAR,

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.699
THOUGH IT IS A SLUGGISH PROCESS.

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:52.590
BACTERIA CAN TAKE WEEKS TO GROW, AND ONLY
THEN CAN ANN DETERMINE IF IT SHOWS PROMISE

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:55.120
AGAINST DRUG-RESISTANT SUPERBUGS.

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:00.600
ANN: Initially we found hundreds of bacteria.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:07.879
We tried to isolate bacteria that live in the
Iron Curtain Cave in the lab, and we found

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:14.910
fourteen of them, initially, that show activity
against multidrug-resistant bacteria,

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:17.200
all those bad bacteria.

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:20.610
AT THAT POINT, THE SAMPLES LEAVE ANN’S LAB
FOR GENOME SEQUENCING.

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:27.689
ANN: Now we actually singled out for the two
of them, so we have the two hopefully superheros

00:07:27.689 --> 00:07:29.010
right now.

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:33.539
OUT OF THE HUNDREDS OF SAMPLES SHE COLLECTED,
ONLY TWO HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BE WHAT ANN

00:07:33.539 --> 00:07:35.759
CALLS “SUPERHERO BACTERIA.”

00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:39.810
BUT JUST BECAUSE THEY WORK IN A PETRI DISH
DOESN’T MEAN THEY WILL WORK IN HUMANS.

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:44.310
IT WILL TAKE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND MANY YEARS 
TO MOVE FORWARD WITH ANY POTENTIAL DRUG,

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:46.120
AND THERE’S VERY LITTLE PROFIT TO BE HAD.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:50.360
THAT’S WHY THERE’S BEEN SLOW, IF ANY,
PROGRESS IN THE LAST FEW YEARS.

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:59.620
ANN: I do believe that we have solutions,
but all of us have to work together, not just

00:07:59.629 --> 00:08:05.110
scientists, not just politicians, not just
the pharmaceutical companies, not just the

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:06.379
policymakers...

00:08:06.379 --> 00:08:13.340
every one of us needs to understand the implications
of overuse and misuse of antibiotics in our

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:16.289
society, and how we can reduce that.

00:08:16.289 --> 00:08:19.360
ANN DOESN’T LET THE DAUNTING 
COMPLICATIONS WAIVER HER.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.680
INSTEAD, HER SEARCH CONTINUES.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:28.639
ANN: This cave gets its name because of this
beautiful backdrop here; you can see that

00:08:28.639 --> 00:08:34.200
it takes numbers of years, 
possibly millions of years, to form...

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:42.460
I can imagine how many species of bacteria
and microorganisms that live in that structure,

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:43.960
that formation.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:49.760
And maybe... maybe one of them could 
actually be our superhero

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.720
that could produce new antibiotics

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.740
for us one day.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.180
