00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:01.149
Vsauce!

00:00:01.149 --> 00:00:06.290
Five rare dogs, Four rare comic books, Three
rare video games, Two rare signatures and

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.090
One rare element

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.059
It's 5-4-3-2...

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:12.339
One rare element.

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:18.150
Astatine named from the greek astatos meaning
unstable; is one of the rarest elements on

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.150
Earth.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.449
It was first produced in 1940 by scientists
at The University of California Berkeley by

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:29.390
bombarding Bismuth-209 with alpha particles
in a particle accelerator to produce Astatine

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.850
211, which the scientists discovered was radioactive.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.890
Three years later Astatine was found naturally
in radioactive decay chains.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:43.460
At any given time only 25 grams of naturally
occurring Astatine exists on the planet.&nbsp;

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.880
Two Rare Signatures

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.790
There are only six existing signatures of
William Shakespeare that are attached to four

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:55.060
different legal documents including a deposition,
the purchase of a house in London, the mortgage

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:00.460
of the same house, and his will which contains
three of the six, one on each page.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:06.040
Neil Armstrong signed plenty of autographs...
until 1994 when his signature became one of

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.590
the rarest because of his decision to stop
signing anything.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.890
He was known to be quite a recluse and never
really like signing them in the first place.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.640
In an biography by James Hansen it says that
Charles Lindbergh advised him to never sign

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.950
autographs and Armstrong claims to regret
not taking the advice.&nbsp;

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.880
Three rare video games

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.500
For this I'm going to defer to rare gaming
expert PatTheNESPunk.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.500
Go!

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.500
Hey,Vsauce!

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.500
Pat here.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.070
Up first is Mr. Boston for the Vectrex system.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.700
This was a modified version of the Pac-Man
clone, Clean Sweep.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.070
Mr. Boston was distributed by the liquor store
company of the same name.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.210
Now less than 10 copies are known to exist
so if you want a cart you're gonna have to

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.150
pay at least a few thousand dollars.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.300
If you can find one!

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.820
Air Raid for the Atari 2600.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.160
A game so mysterious that collectors weren't
even 100% sure about its name until a box

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.299
for it surfaced in 2010.

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.369
Not many were produced and distribution was
extremely limited.

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.820
Now if you want a copy of the game - which
is a strangely-shaped blue cart...

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.770
You're gonna have to pay at least $3,000 or
so.

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.040
But if you want the box and the game you're
looking at a price tag of at least 30 grand!

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.970
Finally, the Nintendo World Championships
1990 gold cart.

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.029
The holy grail of video game collecting.

00:02:18.029 --> 00:02:22.480
26 of these were given away as prizes for
a Nintendo Power magazine contest.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.630
A gold version of the gray ones used during
Powerfest 1990.

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.750
This is a competition cart consisting of Super
Mario Brothers, Rad Racer and Tetris.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.510
If you can find someone willing to part with
one of these treasures you're gonna have to

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:35.779
spend at least $25,000.

00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:44.569
Now, who would be dumb enough to spend that
type of ludicrous cash on a video game?

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:45.569
Uhhh...?

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.400
Four rare comic books

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:54.499
Action Comics #1 was Superman's first appearance
that came out in 1938 and a single original

00:02:54.499 --> 00:02:57.569
copy sold for over two million dollars..

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:02.749
There is said to only be 50-100 original copies
that still exist and even fewer that are in

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:04.370
collectible condition.

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.930
Detective Comics #27 came out in 1939 and
was the first to introduce Batman.

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:17.459
It is considered one of the most valuable,
selling for auction in 2010 for $1,075,000.

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:23.419
Superman #1 was the first to be a superhero
self-titled comic book that premiered in 1939

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:27.519
with a highest sale record of $250,000.

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:32.849
Batman #1 was another instance where the superhero
was so popular they got their own self-titled

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:39.919
comic book, it first appeared in 1940 and
has been sold for $315,000.&nbsp;

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:41.359
Five rare dogs

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:46.290
The Norwegian Lundehund is a small dog that
was bred for hunting puffins and their eggs.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.189
They have six toes and an amazing range of
motion in their joints.

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:54.590
They have the ability to bend their head backwards
all the way to their spine.

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.140
They were almost extinct after after 1963
because of canine distemper.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.889
Only 6 dogs survived, but with some careful
breeding the population is estimated to be

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:06.159
back around 1,500 to 2,000.&nbsp;

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:12.129
The Neopolitan Mastiff is an ancient dog that
dates back to ancient Egypt, Persia, Mesopotamia,

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:13.129
and Asia.

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:17.799
When the Romans conquered Greece they adopted
the giant dogs and used them in battle, hunting,

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:18.840
and the arena.

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.520
After almost becoming extinct after World
War 2, a group of dedicated Italians organized

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.760
and promoted the breed which was first officailly
recognized as a breed in 1948.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.770
The Pachon Navarro is a rare Spanish hunting
dog known for its double nose.

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.240
Once thought to have superior sensing abilities
because of the double nose, it is now known

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.370
that it is only a cosmetic difference.

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.770
The height of their popularity was with Spanish
nobility during the 18th and 19th century,

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.830
but were almost extinct after the Spanish
civil war.

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.759
With the help of some dedicated Pachon Navarro
Lovers the breeding stock has been re-established.&nbsp;

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:59.229
The Chinook is a rare breed of sled dog developed
in the 20th century in the US and is the official

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:00.840
state dog of New Hampshire.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:06.960
By 1981 only 11 breedable Chinooks were left,
but with the efforts of breeders is Maine,

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.509
Ohio, and California they've managed to save
them from extinction.

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:16.470
Only about 800 are registered today with only
around 100 pups born annually worldwide.&nbsp;

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:21.470
The Carolina dog, also known as the american
Dingo, is said to be the oldest canine species

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:22.610
of North America.

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.759
They were discovered in the 1970's in Southeastern
United States and lived without domestication

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:29.810
for thousands of years.

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:35.599
Their DNA is at the base of the canine family
tree suggesting ties to primitive canine lineage;

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:40.289
possibly descendants of ancient dogs that
came over the Bering Strait land bridge thousands

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:41.289
of years ago.&nbsp;

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:44.789
