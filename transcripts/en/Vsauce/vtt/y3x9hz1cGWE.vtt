00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.850
A real Zelda Tresure chest?

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.630
And coming soon from 7-Eleven: two cups, one straw.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.220
Vsauce, Kevin here. This is Mind Blow. A few
years we were treated to a functioning

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.340
NES controller coffee table.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.750
Well, here's a brand new one with custom NES

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.140
art and a place to store all your games.
Now you just need a place to store the

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.970
controller, so...

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.720
Here's a NES console coffee table with a giant

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:38.200
wireless controller inside. Want a more
interactive table? Check out this

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.550
four-player pong table. For instructions
on how to build this, find the link below.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.550
Alright, enough with the coffee tables.
How about dancing robots?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.660
No? How about being a robot?

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.200
This robot exoskeleton is an alternative
mobility solution for people with severe

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.900
walking impairments.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.880
It can walk upstairs and even helps you
fight the alien queen.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.020
If you want technology in the opposite
direction, just sit in this connect

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.450
powered chair. You control it with your hand motions

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.609
and we're on our way to WALL-E.
Hey, do you mind if I park my car in your house?

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.100
Eh, no problem, just let me open it.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.770
There we go. Thanks. One innovation we
need is the public bathroom

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.520
toe-pener. It's a handle at the bottom of the
door, so you can open it with your foot.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.799
An innovation this lady needs is an
uncomfortable looking chair that she can

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.319
fit in her pocket for some reason.

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:40.200
And one mini weapon that I need is this tiny crossbow.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.280
It's made of silver, gold and steel

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:49.600
and can even shoot flare arrows.
This loopy drawing is a euthanasia coaster

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.810
designed to send terminally ill people off

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.139
in a final exhilarating ride to their doom.
Which

00:01:55.139 --> 00:02:00.810
is pretty morbid, right? Right. So here's a
fan-made Megaman children's book cover.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.389
It's not exactly a car that runs on garbage,

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:08.350
but here's an RC car that uses soda can
tabs for fuel.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.060
The aluminium is mixed with sodium
hydroxide and water to create

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.879
a small hydrogen fuel cell. And here's how
to erase a CD with photonic induction

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.640
Emperor Palpatine would be proud. Finally, here's
a look at an epic new shooter from

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.430
Cave.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.580
I'm gonna leave you with a riddle.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.180
"With pointed fangs it sits in wait. With

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:49.520
piercing force it doles out be fate.
Over bloodless victims proclaiming its might.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.520
Eternally joining in a single bite."

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.510
What is it?

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.180
Leave your answer in the comments below and
we're going to do the genius of the week

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.560
a little differently this time.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.709
It's a number scavenger hunt.
There are

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.810
5 clues. Each clue leads to a number.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.209
Three clues are on this page.
One clue is at

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.640
Facebook.com/VsauceGaming
and the final clue is in fact number

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.239
three.

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.269
Find all five and add up the numbers and
give us the total.

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:20.569
Leave your answer in the comments below and
I'll give you a hint

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:24.000
for the one in fact number three.
Sodas rank.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:25.380
Good luck.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.320
And as always,

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.500
thanks for watching.
