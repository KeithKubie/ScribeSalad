MARK JARZOMBEK: Architecture shapes our
culture, our identities, our way

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.320
of life, and even our understanding
of the cosmos.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.280
It continues to shape our current
reality, just as it's shaped our

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.750
reality for thousands of years.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.240
To know who we are today requires that
we know who we were, for as William

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.690
Faulkner once said, "The
past is never dead.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:34.080
It's not even past."

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.670
Some buildings are admittedly in ruins
or have disappeared altogether.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.230
But buildings have amazing longevity.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.640
Even buildings that are hundreds and
thousands of years old can still serve

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.610
as living elements in our culture.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.690
We no longer build pyramids,
of course.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.505
But the pyramids are certainly a
permanent element in our cultural

00:00:51.505 --> 00:00:53.490
imagination.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.290
In this course I've picked up some
important moments in the history of

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.880
architecture, that if you begin to add
them together constitute a global

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.130
perspective.

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.440
First societies still exist in
many parts of the world.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:20.460
We, as modern and agriculturalists,
our history is only 5,000 years.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.540
The buildings I talk about
place architecture in

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.590
the dynamics of history.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.290
Someone had to make the first pyramid.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.490
Someone had to design the first
church or the Buddhist temple.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.470
Someone had even to design
the first tipi.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.100
Architectural history is filled with
moments of transition and innovation,

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.270
brought on by changes in power,
religion, trade, ecology, and

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.400
techniques of production.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.740
We'll start with the architecture of
our first society ancestors, some

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.840
150,000 years ago, and take the story
to about 1400 CE to the doorstep of

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.390
our modern age.

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.930
But in all cases, we're talking about
buildings at shaped our modernity in

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.980
one way or another.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.000
So the caves, these are
not cave people.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.970
They're not living in the caves.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:08.680
The caves are the sacred places of
discourse, if you will, with animals

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:09.930
and ancestors.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.460
I will cover some buildings that might
be well-known, but just as many that

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.390
might be new to you if you are coming
to architectural history

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.390
for the first time.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.210
Having visited many of these places
myself over the years I want to try to

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.820
bring some of the excitement of these
buildings into the classroom as they

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.480
are part of our global civilizational
legacy.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.340
In these lectures, I try to give you
the context of the buildings.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.480
I'll try to give you also the larger
geopolitical story and framework

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.470
architecture within that.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.090
I also try to explain how buildings
function, which is not just a question

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.670
of how they're used, but how buildings
evoke or even model certain

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.230
imaginaries, which I think is an
important part of how architecture

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.680
works, and why buildings are such
exciting things to study.
