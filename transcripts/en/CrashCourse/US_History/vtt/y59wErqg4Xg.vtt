Episode 30: America and World War I

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.310
Hi I’m John Green, this is Crash Course
U.S. history and today we’re finally going

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:06.450
to make the military history buffs happy.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.980
That’s right, today we’re going to talk
about how the United States with its superior

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.730
technology, innovative tactics and remarkable
generalship turned the tide of World War I.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:16.730
Mr. Green, Mr. Green.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:17.730
Finally.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.810
I’ve been waiting for months to learn about
tanks and airplanes and Ernest Hemingway.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.800
Well that’s a shame, Me from the Past, because
I was kidding about this being an episode

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.060
full of military details.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.181
But I do promise that we will mention Ernest
Hemingway.

00:00:28.181 --> 00:00:36.770
And in a few weeks I will tell you about how
he liberated the martinis of Paris.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:43.110
intro
Americans were only involved in the Great

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.850
War for 19 months and, compared with the other
belligerents, we didn’t do much fighting.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.899
Still, the war had profound effects on America
at home, on its place in the world and it

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:57.149
also resulted in an amazing number of war
memorials right here in Indianapolis.

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.039
So, The Great War, which lasted from 1914
until 1918, and featured a lot of men with

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.800
hats and rifles, cost the lives of an estimated
10 million soldiers.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.770
Also the whole thing was kind of horrible
and pointless, unless you love art and literature

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.050
about how horrible and pointless World War
I was in which case, it was a real bonanza.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.400
So, when the war broke out, America remained
neutral, because we were a little bit isolationist

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.300
owing to the fact that we were led, of course,
by President Wilson.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.420
But many Americans sided with the British
because by 1914 we’d pretty much forgotten

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.920
about all the bad parts of British rule, like
all that tea and monarchy.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.180
Plus, they’re so easy to talk to with their
English.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.140
But there were a significant number of Progressives
who worried that involvement in the war would

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.250
get in the way of social reforms at home.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.630
In fact, Wilson courted these groups in the
1916 presidential campaign running on the

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.560
slogan “He kept us out of War.”

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.410
And will continue to keep us out of war until
we reelect him and then he gets us into war.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.410
But, for that slogan to make sense, there
had to have been some way in which war was

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.240
avoided, which brings me to one of the classic
errors made by American history students.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.240
What?

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.240
I haven’t even said anything yet.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.370
But you were about to, Me From the Past, because
if I had asked you what event led the U.S.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.009
to enter World War I, you would have surely
told me that it was the sinking of the cruise

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.000
ship Lusitania by German submarines.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.210
124 American passengers died when the ship,
which had been carrying arms and also guns,

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.250
was torpedoed off the coast of Ireland.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.570
Even though Secretary of State William Jennings
Bryan had warned Americans not to travel on

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.890
British, French, or German ships, Wilson refused
to ban such travel because, you know: freedom.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.110
Bryan promptly resigned.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.500
So how do I know it wasn’t the immediate
cause of our involvement in the war?

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.770
Because the United States declared war on
Germany and the Central powers on April 2,

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.780
1917, almost two years after the sinking of
the Lusitania.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.470
So why did the United States declare war for
only the fourth time in its history?

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.660
Was it the Germans’ decision to resume unrestricted
submarine warfare in early 1917?

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.590
Was it the interception and publication of
the Zimmerman Telegram in which the German

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.040
Foreign Secretary promised to help Mexico
get back California if they joined Germany

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.150
in a war against the U.S?

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.200
Or was it the fall of the Tsarist regime in
Russia, which made Wilson’s claims that

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.420
he wanted to fight to make the world safe
for democracy a bit more plausible?

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.210
Yes, yes, and yes.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.130
Also there was our inclination to help Britain,
to whom we had loaned a $2 billion.

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.070
That’s the thing about wars.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.530
They never start for easy, simple reasons
like Lusitania sinkings.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:21.990
Stupid truth, always resisting simplicity.

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:26.570
Oh, it’s time for the Mystery Document?

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:27.770
The rules here are simple.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.370
I guess the author of the mystery document.

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.310
I’m either right or I get shocked
I. [or possibly “one”] Open covenants

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.060
of peace, openly arrived at, after which there
shall be no private international understandings

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.540
of any kind but diplomacy shall proceed always
frankly and in the public view.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:45.540
II.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.260
[I’m starting to think these are Roman numerals]
Absolute freedom of navigation upon the seas,

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.520
outside territorial waters, alike in peace
and in war, except as the seas may be closed

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:00.060
in whole or in part by international action
for the enforcement of international covenants

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.860
III.

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.910
The removal, so far as possible, of all economic
barriers and the establishment of an equality

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.670
of trade conditions among all the nations
consenting to the peace and associating themselves

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:12.670
for it’s maintenance.

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:13.670
[And] XIV.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:14.860
[I’m going to guess we skipped some.]

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.590
A general association of nations must be formed
under specific covenants for the purpose of

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:25.220
affording mutual guarantees of political independence
and territorial integrity of great and small

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.570
states alike.

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.510
Stan, thank you for throwing me a softball.

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.260
That’s my favorite kind of ball.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:31.260
Other than you, Wilson.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.300
With its mention of self-determination, freedom
of the seas, open diplomacy, and liberal use

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.930
of Roman numerals, I know it is Woodrow Wilson’s
Fourteen Points.

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:46.470
Our second consecutive Woodrow Wilson week
and my second consecutive non-shock.

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.580
Given all of his quasi-imperialism, there’s
something a little bit ideologically inconsistent

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.970
about Wilson, but his Fourteen Points are
pretty admirable as a statement of purpose.

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.210
Most of them deal specifically with colonial
possessions, and were pretty much ignored,

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.910
but I suppose if we have learned anything,
it’s that in American history, it’s the

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.250
thought that counts.

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:09.240
[Libertage]
America’s primary contribution to the Entente

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:14.310
powers winning the war was economic as we
sent all sorts of arms and money “over there.”

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.370
Troops didn’t arrive until the spring of
1918 and eventually over 1 million American

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.070
doughboys served under General John J. Pershing.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:22.500
Not all of these people saw combat.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.680
They were much more likely to die of flu than
bullet wounds, but their sheer numbers were

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.360
enough to force the defeat of the exhausted
Germans.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.510
And now, as promised, I will mention Ernest
Hemingway.

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:36.530
He served as an ambulance driver, which gave
him a close up view of death and misery and

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:41.460
led to his membership in the so called Lost
Generation of writers who lived in Paris in

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.550
the 1920s and tried to make sense of everything.

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.320
Turns out, it’s pretty hard to make sense
of and you’re just going to end up with

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.830
a lot of six-toed cats and then eventually
suicide.

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.580
Okay, so I said earlier than a lot of American
Progressives were anti-war, but certainly

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:53.610
not all of them.

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.199
Like, according to Randolph Bourne, “War
is the health of the state.”

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:01.120
And for progressives like him, “the war
offered the possibility of reforming American

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:06.310
society along scientific lines, instilling
a sense of national unity and self-sacrifice,

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:08.060
and expanding social justice.”

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.540
Let’s go to the ThoughtBubble.

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:13.370
World War I made the national government much
more powerful than it had ever been.

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:18.540
Like, in May of 1917, Congress passed the
selective service act, which required 24 million

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:23.220
men to register for the draft and eventually
increased the size of the army from 120,000

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.290
to 5 million.

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:28.710
The government also commandeered control of
much of the economy to get the country ready

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:33.100
to fight, creating new agencies to regulate
industry, transportation, labor relations,

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:34.240
and agriculture.

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.910
The War Industries Board took charge of all
elements of wartime production setting quotas

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:44.220
and prices and establishing standardized specification
for almost everything, even down to the color

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:45.220
of shoes.

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:50.979
The Railroad Administration administered transportation,
and the Fuel Agency rationed coal and oil.

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:53.850
This regulation sometimes brought about some
of the progressives’ goals.

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:58.570
Like, the War Labor Board, for instance, pushed
for a minimum wage, eight hour days and the

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:00.310
rights of workers to form unions.

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:05.210
Wages rose substantially in the era, working
conditions improved and union membership skyrocketed.

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:10.229
But then so did taxes, and the wealthiest
Americans ended up on the hook for 60% of

00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:11.229
their income.

00:07:11.229 --> 00:07:15.240
Also, in World War I as never before, the
government used its power to shape public

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.240
opinion.

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:20.370
In 1917 the Wilson administration created
the Committee on Public Information, which

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:22.350
only sounds like it’s from an Orwell novel.

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:27.110
Headed by George Creel, the CPI’s team created
a wave of propaganda to get Americans to support

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:31.610
the war, printing pamphlets, making posters
and advertising in swanky motion pictures.

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:36.270
The best known strategies were the speeches
of 75,000 four minute men, who in that amount

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:40.800
of time delivered messages of support for
the war in theaters, schools, and other public

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:41.800
venues.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:45.590
The key concepts in the CPI propaganda effort
were democracy and freedom.

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:50.009
“Creel believed that the war would accelerate
movement towards solving the “age old problems

00:07:50.009 --> 00:07:55.810
of poverty, inequality, oppression, and unhappiness,”
because, obviously, war is the most effective

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:56.810
antidepressant.

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:57.810
Thanks, Thoughtbubble.

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:00.680
So the aforementioned Randolph Bourne might
have had good things so say about war, but

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:05.830
he was also correct when he suggested that
the war would encourage and empower the “least

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:07.949
democratic forces in American life.”

00:08:07.949 --> 00:08:11.590
World War I may have been a war to make the
world safe for democracy but according to

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:16.260
one historian “the war inaugurated the most
intense repression of civil liberties the

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:17.650
nation has ever known.”

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:18.930
War suppressing civil liberties, eh?

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:20.280
I’m glad those days have passed.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:23.990
Speaking of the repression of civil liberties,
the NSA is about to start watching this video

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:25.850
because I’m about to use the word “espionage.”

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:32.130
The Espionage act of 1917 prohibited spying,
interfering with the draft and “false statements”

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:34.389
that might impede military success.

00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:38.969
Even more troubling was the Sedition Act passed
in 1918, which criminalized statements that

00:08:38.969 --> 00:08:43.419
were intended to cast “contempt, scorn or
disrepute” on our form of government or

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:45.790
that advocated interference with the war effort.

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:49.889
So basically these laws made it a crime to
criticize either the war or the government.

00:08:49.889 --> 00:08:54.800
In fact, Eugene Debs, the Socialist who ran
for president in 1912, was one of those convicted

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.509
for giving an anti-war speech.

00:08:56.509 --> 00:09:01.819
He was sentenced to 10 years in prison and
he served three of them, but he ran for president

00:09:01.819 --> 00:09:04.329
from prison and got 900,000 votes.

00:09:04.329 --> 00:09:07.569
Fortunately, thanks to checks and balances,
you can turn to the courts.

00:09:07.569 --> 00:09:09.420
Unfortunately, they weren’t very helpful.

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:13.550
Like in Schenck v. the U.S., the Supreme Court
upheld the conviction of a guy named Schenck

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:17.759
for encouraging people to avoid the draft
and ruled that the government can punish critical

00:09:17.759 --> 00:09:22.089
speech when it presents a “clear and present
danger,” to the state and its citizens.

00:09:22.089 --> 00:09:26.220
This was when Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes
introduced the famous exception to free speech,

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:29.230
that it is not okay to “shout fire in a
crowded theater.”

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:33.699
Nor apparently is it okay to shout, “We
shouldn’t be in this war, I don’t think.

00:09:33.699 --> 00:09:34.699
Just my opinion.”

00:09:34.699 --> 00:09:35.699
But, some went even further.

00:09:35.699 --> 00:09:40.910
The 250,000 strong American Protective League
helped the Justice Department identify radicals

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:43.760
by harassing people in what were called “slacker
raids.”

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:47.129
Good thing those stopped before you got to
high school, right Me from the Past?

00:09:47.129 --> 00:09:48.129
Slacker.

00:09:48.129 --> 00:09:53.139
In Bisbee, Arizona vigilantes went so far
to put striking copper miners in boxcars,

00:09:53.139 --> 00:09:55.800
shipped them out to the middle of the desert
and left them there.

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:59.399
The war also raised the question of what it
meant to be a ‘real American.’

00:09:59.399 --> 00:10:03.910
Like, public schools “Americanized” immigrants
and sought to “implant in their children,

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:09.870
so far as can be done, the Anglo-Saxon conceptions
of righteousness, law and order, and popular

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:10.870
government.”

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:14.439
Many cities sponsored Americanization pageants,
especially around the Fourth of July, which

00:10:14.439 --> 00:10:18.029
the CPI in 1918 re-christened “Loyalty Day”.

00:10:18.029 --> 00:10:21.720
Hamburgers, a German word, became liberty
sandwiches.

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:26.110
World War I certainly didn’t create anti-immigrant
feeling in the United States, but it was used

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:27.389
to justify it.

00:10:27.389 --> 00:10:31.470
Like, IQ tests, introduced to screen army
applicants, were soon used to argue that certain

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:36.209
immigrant groups were inferior to white protestants
and could never be fully assimilated into

00:10:36.209 --> 00:10:37.209
the United States.

00:10:37.209 --> 00:10:40.000
Now, of course, those tests were tremendously
biased, but no matter.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.769
But, to return to the questions of dissent
and free speech, the suppression continued

00:10:43.769 --> 00:10:48.209
after the war with the 1919 Palmer Raids,
for instance, named after Attorney General

00:10:48.209 --> 00:10:51.670
A. Mitchell Palmer and headed up by a young
J. Edgar Hoover.

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:53.980
To be fair, someone did try to blow up Palmer.

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:57.259
So there was some dissent related to the suppression
of dissent.

00:10:57.259 --> 00:11:02.189
Also, more than 4 million workers engaged
in strikes in the United States in 1919 but

00:11:02.189 --> 00:11:07.600
that didn’t legally justify the arrest of
more than 5,000 suspected radicals and labor

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:08.600
organizers.

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:12.399
Most of them were arrested without warrants
and held without charge, sometimes for months.

00:11:12.399 --> 00:11:15.579
And it’s difficult to imagine that all of
this would have happened without the heightened

00:11:15.579 --> 00:11:18.490
sense of patriotism that always accompanies
war.

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:21.720
However, there were a handful of good things
to come out of the Great War, and not just

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.350
the stylings of Irving Berlin.

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:27.769
Like, students are often taught that the war
led directly to the passage of the 19th amendment,

00:11:27.769 --> 00:11:31.839
although a number of states had actually granted
the franchise to women before the war.

00:11:31.839 --> 00:11:35.170
In Montana, for instance, women didn’t just
vote, they held office.

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:39.279
Congresswoman Jeannette Rankin voted against
the declaration of war in 1917, and was the

00:11:39.279 --> 00:11:44.290
only member of the House to vote against the
declaration of war against Japan in 1941.

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:48.279
New opportunities in wartime industry also
provided incentives for African Americans

00:11:48.279 --> 00:11:53.040
to move north, thus beginning the so-called
great migration and the growth of black populations

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:55.439
in northern cities like Chicago and New York.

00:11:55.439 --> 00:12:00.110
The biggest gain was in Detroit where between
1910 and 1920 the black population rose from

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:05.509
5,741 to 40,838, a 611% increase.

00:12:05.509 --> 00:12:10.309
So it’s true that World War I provided some
new opportunities for African Americans and

00:12:10.309 --> 00:12:14.589
women, but if World War I was supposed to
be an opportunity for America to impose its

00:12:14.589 --> 00:12:17.709
progressive ideas on the rest of the world,
it failed.

00:12:17.709 --> 00:12:21.709
The Versailles peace conference where Wilson
tried to implement his 14 Points raised hope

00:12:21.709 --> 00:12:23.309
for a new diplomatic order.

00:12:23.309 --> 00:12:26.279
But, the results of the treaty made the 14
points look hypocritical.

00:12:26.279 --> 00:12:31.009
I mean, especially when Britain and France
took control of Germany’s former colonies

00:12:31.009 --> 00:12:35.299
and carved up the Arabian provinces of the
Ottoman Empire into new spheres of influence.

00:12:35.299 --> 00:12:39.820
Wilson’s dream of a League of Nations was
realized, but the U.S. never joined it largely

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:43.959
because Congress was nervous about giving
up its sovereign power to declare war.

00:12:43.959 --> 00:12:49.179
And disappointment over the outcome of World
War I led the U.S. to, for the most part,

00:12:49.179 --> 00:12:52.079
retreat into isolationism until World War
II.

00:12:52.079 --> 00:12:54.660
And therein lies the ultimate failure of World
War I.

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:58.151
It’s not called “The World War,” it’s
called “World War I,” because then we

00:12:58.151 --> 00:13:00.249
had to go and have a freaking other one.

00:13:00.249 --> 00:13:03.420
We’ll talk about that in a few weeks, but
next week we get to talk about suffrage.

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:04.420
Yes!

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:05.639
We finally did something right.

00:13:05.639 --> 00:13:06.639
I’ll see you then.

00:13:06.639 --> 00:13:08.639
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller.

00:13:08.639 --> 00:13:10.480
Our script supervisor is Meredith Danko.

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:11.889
The associate producer is Danica Johnson.

00:13:11.889 --> 00:13:15.920
The show is written by my high school history
teacher Raoul Meyer, Rosianna Rojas, and myself.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.579
And our graphics team is Thought Café.

00:13:17.579 --> 00:13:19.329
Every week, there’s a new caption for the
Libertage.

00:13:19.329 --> 00:13:23.040
If you’d like to suggest one, you can do
so in comments where you can also ask questions

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:25.660
about today’s video that will be answered
by our team of historians.

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:28.970
Thanks for watching Crash Course and as we
say in my hometown, don’t forget to be awesome.

00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:34.079
Stan, can you do some movie magic to get me
out of here?

00:13:34.079 --> 00:13:34.730
Perfect.
