and so there's an incentive to get it
 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:15.679
and so there's an incentive to get it
right and this wonderful manipulative

wasn't registering their answers so all
 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.009
wasn't registering their answers so all
they had to do is think what their

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019
they had to do is think what their
 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.809
they had to do is think what their
answer was and then tell you afterward

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819
answer was and then tell you afterward
 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:31.159

you would see is it was a random task so
 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.030
you would see is it was a random task so
most of the time people were having

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040
most of the time people were having
 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.729
most of the time people were having
about a 50/50 percent success rate and

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739
about a 50/50 percent success rate and
 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.009
about a 50/50 percent success rate and
along comes the opportunities to cheat

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019
along comes the opportunities to cheat
 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.170
along comes the opportunities to cheat
and if people's accuracy suddenly jumps

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180
and if people's accuracy suddenly jumps
 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.099
and if people's accuracy suddenly jumps
up at that point

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109
up at that point
 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:51.740
up at that point
aha that's how you detect a cheat or

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750
aha that's how you detect a cheat or
 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.050
aha that's how you detect a cheat or
someone who's long at that point so the

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060
someone who's long at that point so the
 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.550
someone who's long at that point so the
question becomes what's going on in the

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560
question becomes what's going on in the
 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.649
question becomes what's going on in the
brains of people who achieve is it those

00:03:57.649 --> 00:03:57.659
brains of people who achieve is it those
 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:03:59.509
brains of people who achieve is it those
opportunities and what you saw was as

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519
opportunities and what you saw was as
 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.939
opportunities and what you saw was as
soon as that active came up their

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:01.949
soon as that active came up their
 

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:04.819
soon as that active came up their
frontal cortex is activated like mad

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829
frontal cortex is activated like mad
 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:07.369
frontal cortex is activated like mad
they're wrestling with Satan they're

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379
they're wrestling with Satan they're
 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:09.140
they're wrestling with Satan they're
wondering if they should do it or not

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150
wondering if they should do it or not
 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.610
wondering if they should do it or not
they're wondering if they should have

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620
they're wondering if they should have
 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.110
they're wondering if they should have
done it the last time when they were

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120
done it the last time when they were
 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.849
done it the last time when they were
honest they're wondering if they're ever

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:13.859
honest they're wondering if they're ever
 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:16.189
honest they're wondering if they're ever
good they're wrestling all of that okay

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:16.199
good they're wrestling all of that okay
 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:18.259
good they're wrestling all of that okay
so that makes sense then you look at the

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269
so that makes sense then you look at the
 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.420
so that makes sense then you look at the
people who cheating opportunity or

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430
people who cheating opportunity or
 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.300
people who cheating opportunity or
otherwise never cheat so what's going on

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310
otherwise never cheat so what's going on
 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.000
otherwise never cheat so what's going on
of them and we've got the two models

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010
of them and we've got the two models
 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.740
of them and we've got the two models
there one of we

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750
there one of we
 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.050
there one of we
power is because they've got frontal

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060
power is because they've got frontal
 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.010
power is because they've got frontal
cortexes that can chest like be be stoic

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020
cortexes that can chest like be be stoic
 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.320
cortexes that can chest like be be stoic
and Calvinist and gumption out the wazoo

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330
and Calvinist and gumption out the wazoo
 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.440
and Calvinist and gumption out the wazoo
there or is it the state of grace they

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450
there or is it the state of grace they
 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.540
there or is it the state of grace they
don't cheat because you don't cheat and

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550
don't cheat because you don't cheat and
 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.180
don't cheat because you don't cheat and
the prediction there is if it's all

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190
the prediction there is if it's all
 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.770
the prediction there is if it's all
about willpower as soon as the

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780
about willpower as soon as the
 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.990
about willpower as soon as the
opportunity to cheat comes up their

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000
opportunity to cheat comes up their
 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.940
opportunity to cheat comes up their
frontal cortices are going to go through

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950
frontal cortices are going to go through
 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.340
frontal cortices are going to go through
the roof in terms of activity if it's a

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350
the roof in terms of activity if it's a
 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.640
the roof in terms of activity if it's a
matter of grace whatever and it was a

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650
matter of grace whatever and it was a
 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.350
matter of grace whatever and it was a
matter of grace the people who never

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360
matter of grace the people who never
 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.360
matter of grace the people who never
cheated it wasn't because they had the

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370
cheated it wasn't because they had the
 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.000
cheated it wasn't because they had the
struck strongest frontal cortexes it's

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010
struck strongest frontal cortexes it's
 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.370
struck strongest frontal cortexes it's
because you don't do that it was that

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380
because you don't do that it was that
 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.950
because you don't do that it was that
simple it wasn't a temptation and that's

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960
simple it wasn't a temptation and that's
 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.040
simple it wasn't a temptation and that's
much more of a model of it's not a realm

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050
much more of a model of it's not a realm
 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.100
much more of a model of it's not a realm
of just having to work so so hard to

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110
of just having to work so so hard to
 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.040
of just having to work so so hard to
feel for somebody else or not pocket

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050
feel for somebody else or not pocket
 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.750
feel for somebody else or not pocket
that thing even though nobody's looking

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760
that thing even though nobody's looking
 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.960
that thing even though nobody's looking
you just don't do that it's automatic

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:21.970
you just don't do that it's automatic
 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:25.220
you just don't do that it's automatic
