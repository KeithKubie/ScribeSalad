00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.710
I think we have mastered a lot of the physical
problems that come along with space travel.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:01.970
But then psychologically we haven't really
understood the amount of stress and strain

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:15.380
that people are going to be under.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.970
Astronauts need to be on constant alert. Maintaining a stress response for a long period of time

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.650
can lead to exhaustion, we also have problems
with things like inter group conflicts.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:32.830
If you are put in a closed environment with a
lot of other people, this can be very difficult.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:38.630
We also have problems with workload. They
are asked to do too many experiments and they don't

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:46.110
get enough down time. It can be very difficult
for that individual to say, 'actually I have

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.270
some thoughts of anxiety,' or 'I'm starting to
feel some elements of depression'.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.240
It can be easier to cover up those issues than actually
be honest.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.950
These problems can lead into increases
in human error. These are not big issues when

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.619
you are on Earth, everybody makes these everyday
slips, however if your doing that in a very

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.989
risky environment, then that can have really
adverse effects.

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.049
Measuring bodily stress is done now in the
space station, they take urine samples, blood

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:24.569
samples and so on. But when you are talking
about the psychological stresses of space

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:32.290
travel the situation is much more complex.
One way that we think we can help is to look

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.840
at their speech, or in particular look at
their speaking. In other words the way in

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:45.520
which they use speech, they way in which they
sound and the kinds of words they use when they speak.

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:50.400
Speech is quite a good test of all kinds of
states of wellbeing, because it is effected

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.430
by both the physiological state and the psychological
state of the individual. So to explore whether

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:02.950
we could use voice to detect changes in mood
and psychological well being, we look at the

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:10.730
recordings made during the Mars 500 simulated
mission to Mars. Six cosmonauts were sent

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:18.069
on a 9 month trip inside a module, although
the module didn't go anywhere it was just

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:19.209
parked in a car park.

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:26.849
What we were able to show was that analysis of the
audio recordings did indeed show situations

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:36.749
where a particular speaker may have changed
their mood, or changed their level of excitement,

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:45.249
or the topic of discussion became exciting
which changed the way in which they spoke.

00:03:45.249 --> 00:03:52.459
We were able to identify particular recordings
which, in our sense, were anomalous.

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:58.980
They did not seem to follow the standard pattern
of the person's speech. So we could say; on

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.909
this particular day, on this particular recording,
the way in which this person was speaking

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:05.480
was unusual.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.040
Whether the way in which they feel effects
the way that they speak and whether we can

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:17.180
pick up those signals automatically, and then
from that analysis of their voice try and

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:22.930
raise the alarm that the characteristics of
their voice are outside their normal parameters.

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:30.389
So anything we can do that we can try to monitor
and detect these psychological stresses might

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:33.829
be very valuable in protecting the health
of the astronaut.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:39.940
On short term space missions, psychological
issues are manageable, but on longer term

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:46.400
space mission they can become much more important
and overcoming them will really help us in

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.530
our quest to travel to the stars.
