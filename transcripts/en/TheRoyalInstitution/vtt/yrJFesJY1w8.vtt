00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.500
So I've invited my good friend Greg here
over to the Royal Institution to have a bit

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.070
of a BBQ.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.580
But to make it a bit more interesting I thought
that we should do this BBQ without any coals.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.580
Woah!

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.960
So we've come up with a few alternative ways
of cooking with our food here. And Greg over

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.810
at the BritLab channel you're going to be
using some chemistry?

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.610
Yeah, so we've gone for some quite hazardous
chemistry processes to try to cook steak.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.600
So if you're new here and you like what we
do then feel free to reward us with a sub

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.350
and look out for the link at the end to go
to the BritLab page and see Greg and me playing

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.579
around with some chemistry. And don't forget
to subscribe to them when you're over there

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:43.139
as well.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.780
So this little device is going to pump some
mains electricity through a little bit of

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.999
steak. I've got our steak there, I've also
got this bit of steak over here. I've been

00:00:55.999 --> 00:01:00.499
soaking it in salt water to try and increase
the conductivity and hopefully that will give

00:01:00.499 --> 00:01:01.519
us some more action.

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:06.760
And clearly because you really like salty
steak. Exactly. Exactly. Who doesn't love

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.700
a bit of salty steak.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.740
Hopefully we should see some action but I'm
not promising anything. - Ok great.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.450
Ooh, we're getting some bubbles.
It's fizzing.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.780
And it's turning white.
It's cooking!

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.670
It is cooking.
- It's cooking!

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.000
It's working!
- Huh.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.660
So what's the setup here Andy?
We're plugged into the mains...

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:32.420
Yeah, we're plugged into the mains.
We're also plugged into a kettle down here.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:33.640
There we go.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.970
The kettle is actually just acting as a resistor,
It's making sure I'm not drawing too much

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:38.600
current basically.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.720
We're plugged into the mains,
we have 240 volts passing through this steak.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.810
So the electricity is going up through one
fork,

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:48.580
conducting through the meat,

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.610
because you've put salt on it.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.560
Ooh, lovely.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.510
That's genius.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.690
Smells alright, doesn't it?
Oh there we go. There we go.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.060
Quickly stepped away there!

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.240
So the reason why it's cooking is that we're
pushing all these electrons through, all this

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.590
electricty through the steak. And as the electrons
are being forced through, they're bumping

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.890
into all the other atoms in the steak and
all the molecules and transferring all the

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.310
energy. Because the steak doesn't conduct
that well, you have to push those electrons

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.500
really hard and then they transfer a lot of
energy when they bump into things. So this

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.140
process is called Joule heating. Basically
the way electricity heats things up as it

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.489
flows.

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.349
And that was orange as well, wasn't it.
- It was orange.

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:30.209
So that's really interesting. Because I was
soaking this in salt, sodium chloride, the

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.090
sodium ions in there, when the electricty
passes through them, they excite the ions

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.540
and you get that orange glow which is the
same orange you get in sodium streetlights.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.799
The characteristic colour of sodium.

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:41.480
Safety first.
- Indeed.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.120
Exploding sausage and LEDs.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:44.879
OK, ready?
- Yeah.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.740
It works!
- Look at that.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.820
You've got a meat circuit going on here.

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:55.489
That is amazing.

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.689
That's groundbreaking science
happening right here at the Royal Insitution.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.240
So what we're hoping to do is to...
Well we were hoping to before it started to

00:03:08.249 --> 00:03:12.469
pour with rain outside.
- Good old British summer.

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:19.370
Was to use the sun's radiation to shine on
the parabolic dish focussing all of that energy,

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.980
into one point of the focus of the parabola,
to cook the steak. The parabola has this interesting

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:30.769
property that when you have parallel beams
arriving on the parabola, all those beams,

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:35.200
wherever they hit the surface, all get reflected
to the same poiint. So it's kind of collecting

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.560
all the energy that falls over this whole
area and focussing it down to one point. So

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.200
you're actually creating an amazing amount
of heat.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.299
And is that why you've got two? So if you
fire one at one, does that produce parallel

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:48.980
rays?

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.189
Exactly the same thing in reverse. So if you
produce radiation at one focus it will spread

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:57.609
out and then get reflected and you'll have
parallel beams and then obviously collected

00:03:57.609 --> 00:03:58.439
at the other focus.

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:00.029
I'll tell you what, I'll look...
Oh, it's going, it's going!

00:04:00.029 --> 00:04:03.729
I thought I'd look next to it for smoke and
we're getting smoke.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.460
That doesn't look bad at all. I mean that's
almost edible.

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:08.579
Yeah, I'd say that...

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:10.419
Should we try it?
- I think we should.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.640
You got that? And then flip it over.
And the other side is rare.

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.070
A bit warm.
-Let's go for it.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.680
Sorry, I've thoroughly
manhandled your bit but you know.

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:24.480
Thanks, mate.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:26.240
It's delicious.

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:28.240
That's great.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.660
That's another winner.
-That is another winner.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.260
This is going so much better than we ever
thought it would.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:46.020
I've got a little bit of alcohol at the bottom.
It's isopropyl alcohol which is not your regular

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.900
ethanol kind. So I'm sloshing this around.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:56.120
So in there we have the alcohol mixed with
the oxygen in a vapour so it's a perfect combustible mix.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:01.229
And we're going to have just a couple of toasted
prawns. I have no paprika, it's the one thing

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:02.470
I forgot.

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.000
Woah!
- Haha!

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.759
Sorry, that was my bad, I flinched.

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:09.099
And I was all like...

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:17.069
It's just like a Saturn V rocket isn't it?
We've got the fuel there premixed with oxygen

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:21.800
so it's all ready to burn. And all the thrust
is coming upside down, I guess it's like an...

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.000
upside down Saturn V. If you need to BBQ a
prawn you've got to turn your rocket upside

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.669
down as the proverb goes.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.360
And potentially send a prawn into space.
- Yeah, OK.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.760
is it warm at all?
- It's warm-ish.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.840
It's not crispy.
I think we can do better.

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.220
I think what we need to do is almost strap
the prawn down. Because at the moment your

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.729
upside down Saturn V is trying to blast the
prawn off into space.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.700
Now the gauze on top.

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.880
I don't know why people haven't done this
before really.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.160
This is surreal.
- It's an interesting woosh rocket, isn't it?

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.079
Woah.
- That might be it.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.310
Look at the prawn shape on it.
- Amazing.

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:42.230
Do you like isopropanoly prawns?
- I'll give it a go.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.400
Really?
- Yeah.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.760
Is it warm?
- It's warm.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.520
Yeah, it tastes a bit disgusting,
I'll be honest with you. - Weird that.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.360
Well that was pretty good.
- That was amazing.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.599
Overall I think we've done well.
So we electrocuted a steak. That worked well.

00:06:59.599 --> 00:07:04.030
That was tasty. We used the parabolic mirrors,
we had the heatlamp going and that was tasty

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:08.710
as well. The prawn... you know... it was fun
but I'm not going to say that's the best way

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:12.479
of cooking prawn I've ever seen in my life.
So that was the extreme physics approach to

00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:18.250
a BBQ. So yeah, if you want to check out the
extreme chemistry approach then click on the

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:20.639
link, head over to BritLab and see how Greg
and I got on over there.

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:22.199
It was a lot of fun.
- It was a lot of fun.

00:07:22.199 --> 00:07:22.949
And firey.

00:07:22.949 --> 00:07:27.750
So yeah, that's about it, don't forget to
subscribe. I hope you liked what you saw here

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.760
And see you next time.
