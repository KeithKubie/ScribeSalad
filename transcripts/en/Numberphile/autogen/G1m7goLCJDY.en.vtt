00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.050
okay today we have a puzzle so I'm gonna

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060
okay today we have a puzzle so I'm gonna
 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.539
okay today we have a puzzle so I'm gonna
give you all the numbers from 1 to 15 I

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549
give you all the numbers from 1 to 15 I
 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.460
give you all the numbers from 1 to 15 I
suspect you're gonna shorten this

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470
suspect you're gonna shorten this
 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.190
suspect you're gonna shorten this
dramatically in the edit your challenge

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200
dramatically in the edit your challenge
 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.690
dramatically in the edit your challenge
is can you take numbers from 1 to 15 and

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700
is can you take numbers from 1 to 15 and
 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.780
is can you take numbers from 1 to 15 and
can you rearrange them into a new water

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:13.790
can you rearrange them into a new water
 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.810
can you rearrange them into a new water
such that any two adjacent numbers add

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820
such that any two adjacent numbers add
 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.750
such that any two adjacent numbers add
to give you a square number so for

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760
to give you a square number so for
 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.300
to give you a square number so for
example you could put 1 let's give it a

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310
example you could put 1 let's give it a
 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.609
example you could put 1 let's give it a
go we go to try we can put one there and

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619
go we go to try we can put one there and
 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.800
go we go to try we can put one there and
then next to it we could put 3 you go

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810
then next to it we could put 3 you go
 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.450
then next to it we could put 3 you go
okay that's pretty good because 1 for 3

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460
okay that's pretty good because 1 for 3
 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.370
okay that's pretty good because 1 for 3
is 4 that's a square number I could

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380
is 4 that's a square number I could
 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.590
is 4 that's a square number I could
check 6 here because 3 plus 6 is 9

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600
check 6 here because 3 plus 6 is 9
 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.380
check 6 here because 3 plus 6 is 9
that's a square number Oh what am I

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390
that's a square number Oh what am I
 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.420
that's a square number Oh what am I
gonna do what can I add to that to make

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430
gonna do what can I add to that to make
 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.619
gonna do what can I add to that to make
it a square number 10 no what right and

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629
it a square number 10 no what right and
 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.260
it a square number 10 no what right and
then so on so we'll give you a second if

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270
then so on so we'll give you a second if
 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.029
then so on so we'll give you a second if
you want to try it so we have to use all

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039
you want to try it so we have to use all
 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.639
you want to try it so we have to use all
of them yeah fuse all of them in one

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649
of them yeah fuse all of them in one
 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.580
of them yeah fuse all of them in one
long line any order you want that any

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590
long line any order you want that any
 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.799
long line any order you want that any
two that are adjacent have to add to a

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809
two that are adjacent have to add to a
 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:05.940
two that are adjacent have to add to a
square number

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950
 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.930
welcome back thank you for trying the

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940
welcome back thank you for trying the
 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.600
welcome back thank you for trying the
puzzle if you got it could be it could

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610
puzzle if you got it could be it could
 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.060
puzzle if you got it could be it could
be days later my goodness how you have

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070
be days later my goodness how you have
 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.190
be days later my goodness how you have
aged but you know you gave it a go you

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200
aged but you know you gave it a go you
 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.300
aged but you know you gave it a go you
saying buddy you didn't think it was

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310
saying buddy you didn't think it was
 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.440
saying buddy you didn't think it was
possible like it feels unlikely you know

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450
possible like it feels unlikely you know
 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.810
possible like it feels unlikely you know
but it can be done and I gave you a

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820
but it can be done and I gave you a
 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.180
but it can be done and I gave you a
false start it doesn't work if you have

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190
false start it doesn't work if you have
 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.400
false start it doesn't work if you have
these numbers in this order so I

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:27.410
these numbers in this order so I
 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.230
these numbers in this order so I
deliberately and very meanly gave you a

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240
deliberately and very meanly gave you a
 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.460
deliberately and very meanly gave you a
starting point that does not work why

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470
starting point that does not work why
 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.110
starting point that does not work why
would you do this because I'm a jerk I

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:35.120
would you do this because I'm a jerk I
 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.070
would you do this because I'm a jerk I
want people to work it out for

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080
want people to work it out for
 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.510
want people to work it out for
themselves but why doesn't it work right

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520
themselves but why doesn't it work right
 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.550
themselves but why doesn't it work right
because this does that this fulfills the

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560
because this does that this fulfills the
 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.550
because this does that this fulfills the
requirement every two of these do add to

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560
requirement every two of these do add to
 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.860
requirement every two of these do add to
give you a square number but then you

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:44.870
give you a square number but then you
 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.930
give you a square number but then you
just you can't join up the rest of them

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940
just you can't join up the rest of them
 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.640
just you can't join up the rest of them
right you've run out of another room so

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650
right you've run out of another room so
 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.010
right you've run out of another room so
the way I went about solving this when I

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020
the way I went about solving this when I
 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.840
the way I went about solving this when I
first did it was I thought okay I'm

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850
first did it was I thought okay I'm
 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.719
first did it was I thought okay I'm
gonna draw all the possible links

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729
gonna draw all the possible links
 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.160
gonna draw all the possible links
because you start looking at this and

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170
because you start looking at this and
 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.200
because you start looking at this and
you're like okay where 10 works with 15

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210
you're like okay where 10 works with 15
 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.930
you're like okay where 10 works with 15
cuz I get 25 but 10 also works with 6

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940
cuz I get 25 but 10 also works with 6
 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.870
cuz I get 25 but 10 also works with 6
and so actually I've got other options

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880
and so actually I've got other options
 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.139
and so actually I've got other options
for how I put them in the same order and

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149
for how I put them in the same order and
 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.900
for how I put them in the same order and
some of them have more possible links or

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910
some of them have more possible links or
 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.250
some of them have more possible links or
neighbors they could go with then you

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260
neighbors they could go with then you
 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.660
neighbors they could go with then you
can actually put in a long line so I was

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670
can actually put in a long line so I was
 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:14.979
can actually put in a long line so I was
like right right I'm gonna do this

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989
like right right I'm gonna do this
 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:18.580
like right right I'm gonna do this
there's why but one over here I can do

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590
there's why but one over here I can do
 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.430
there's why but one over here I can do
them in order that's one okay 2 1 &amp; 2

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440
them in order that's one okay 2 1 &amp; 2
 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.050
them in order that's one okay 2 1 &amp; 2
don't add to give you a square number so

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060
don't add to give you a square number so
 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.100
don't add to give you a square number so
I'm gonna put 2 over there out of the

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110
I'm gonna put 2 over there out of the
 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.500
I'm gonna put 2 over there out of the
way right ok 3 nothing I can add link to

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510
way right ok 3 nothing I can add link to
 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.470
way right ok 3 nothing I can add link to
1 because that gives me 4 that is a

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480
1 because that gives me 4 that is a
 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.470
1 because that gives me 4 that is a
square number now four doesn't work with

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480
square number now four doesn't work with
 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.100
square number now four doesn't work with
anything so far but does work with five

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110
anything so far but does work with five
 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:42.070
anything so far but does work with five
so five over there six works with three

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080
so five over there six works with three
 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.720
so five over there six works with three
and so you can see if I only had the

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730
and so you can see if I only had the
 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.330
and so you can see if I only had the
numbers from 1 to 6 it wouldn't be

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340
numbers from 1 to 6 it wouldn't be
 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.460
numbers from 1 to 6 it wouldn't be
possible to order them so every single

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470
possible to order them so every single
 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.979
possible to order them so every single
pair adds to a square number put 7 into

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989
pair adds to a square number put 7 into
 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.320
pair adds to a square number put 7 into
the mix 7 goes with 2 because it gives

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330
the mix 7 goes with 2 because it gives
 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:59.470
the mix 7 goes with 2 because it gives
you 9 8 adds on to 1 gives you 9 9 fits

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480
you 9 8 adds on to 1 gives you 9 9 fits
 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.220
you 9 8 adds on to 1 gives you 9 9 fits
in off 7 because I get 16 10 links into

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230
in off 7 because I get 16 10 links into
 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.770
in off 7 because I get 16 10 links into
6 16 11 and still now I've got these

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780
6 16 11 and still now I've got these
 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.090
6 16 11 and still now I've got these
series I could use in fact if this looks

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100
series I could use in fact if this looks
 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.160
series I could use in fact if this looks
familiar that there is the original

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170
familiar that there is the original
 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.120
familiar that there is the original
series I gave 8 1 3 6 10

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130
series I gave 8 1 3 6 10
 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.850
series I gave 8 1 3 6 10
is one possible ordering but there's no

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860
is one possible ordering but there's no
 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.290
is one possible ordering but there's no
way so far to link it up with the rest

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300
way so far to link it up with the rest
 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.670
way so far to link it up with the rest
of them we'll keep filling these in 12

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680
of them we'll keep filling these in 12
 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.130
of them we'll keep filling these in 12
to 4:13 we'll also link to 12 because I

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140
to 4:13 we'll also link to 12 because I
 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.340
to 4:13 we'll also link to 12 because I
can get 25 but I can also get 16 so that

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350
can get 25 but I can also get 16 so that
 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.910
can get 25 but I can also get 16 so that
links to AHA okay so now we're starting

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920
links to AHA okay so now we're starting
 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.280
links to AHA okay so now we're starting
to join this all together let's put in

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290
to join this all together let's put in
 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.820
to join this all together let's put in
14 and 14 is the first number where now

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830
14 and 14 is the first number where now
 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.760
14 and 14 is the first number where now
everything holds together because 14 25

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:44.770
everything holds together because 14 25
 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.420
everything holds together because 14 25
and 16 we've now got a connected network

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430
and 16 we've now got a connected network
 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.850
and 16 we've now got a connected network
or graph whatever you want to call it

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860
or graph whatever you want to call it
 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.950
or graph whatever you want to call it
but there's no path right so this would

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:52.960
but there's no path right so this would
 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.750
but there's no path right so this would
work but you've missed one and eight

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760
work but you've missed one and eight
 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.220
work but you've missed one and eight
that would work but you've missed these

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230
that would work but you've missed these
 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.310
that would work but you've missed these
so at 14 it's all joined together but

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320
so at 14 it's all joined together but
 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.890
so at 14 it's all joined together but
doesn't work 15 is the one you need to

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900
doesn't work 15 is the one you need to
 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.590
doesn't work 15 is the one you need to
hold it all together because 15 fills in

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600
hold it all together because 15 fills in
 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.160
hold it all together because 15 fills in
this gap 1 there's 25 and 16 and now

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170
this gap 1 there's 25 and 16 and now
 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:13.800
this gap 1 there's 25 and 16 and now
there's our solution 8 1 15 10 6 3 13 12

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810
there's our solution 8 1 15 10 6 3 13 12
 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.870
there's our solution 8 1 15 10 6 3 13 12
and then all the way along that tail and

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880
and then all the way along that tail and
 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.360
and then all the way along that tail and
so that is the order you've got to put

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370
so that is the order you've got to put
 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.940
so that is the order you've got to put
those numbers so that every single pair

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950
those numbers so that every single pair
 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.190
those numbers so that every single pair
between them adds to a square number and

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200
between them adds to a square number and
 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.710
between them adds to a square number and
I annoyingly I picked this bit here of

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720
I annoyingly I picked this bit here of
 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.200
I annoyingly I picked this bit here of
this curve knowing that that is not a

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210
this curve knowing that that is not a
 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.470
this curve knowing that that is not a
valid part of the path that goes all the

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480
valid part of the path that goes all the
 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.050
valid part of the path that goes all the
way through this square sums Network

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060
way through this square sums Network
 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.680
way through this square sums Network
that makes 15 that makes 15 a prisoner's

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690
that makes 15 that makes 15 a prisoner's
 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.450
that makes 15 that makes 15 a prisoner's
remember it's the first number for which

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460
remember it's the first number for which
 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:40.920
remember it's the first number for which
you can order the numbers so every

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930
you can order the numbers so every
 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.900
you can order the numbers so every
single so you you a right braiser thing

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910
single so you you a right braiser thing
 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.430
single so you you a right braiser thing
that doesn't feel likely and it's

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440
that doesn't feel likely and it's
 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.590
that doesn't feel likely and it's
because I pick 15 because up until then

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600
because I pick 15 because up until then
 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.560
because I pick 15 because up until then
doesn't work I could pick 16 actually

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570
doesn't work I could pick 16 actually
 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.760
doesn't work I could pick 16 actually
because 16 you can add on to 9 to get 25

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770
because 16 you can add on to 9 to get 25
 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:54.210
because 16 you can add on to 9 to get 25
okay

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220
okay
 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.000
okay
oh wait all 17 okay so 17 goes over

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010
oh wait all 17 okay so 17 goes over
 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:58.740
oh wait all 17 okay so 17 goes over
there and so now you think well there

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750
there and so now you think well there
 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:59.370
there and so now you think well there
you go

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380
you go
 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.890
you go
and there's a path 16 all the way

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900
and there's a path 16 all the way
 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.070
and there's a path 16 all the way
through to 17 you have a perfectly valid

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080
through to 17 you have a perfectly valid
 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.900
through to 17 you have a perfectly valid
solution but why stop there why not do

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910
solution but why stop there why not do
 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.900
solution but why stop there why not do
it from 1 to 18 18 fits in over here if

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910
it from 1 to 18 18 fits in over here if
 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.270
it from 1 to 18 18 fits in over here if
there's 18 oh now now we've got a

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280
there's 18 oh now now we've got a
 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.320
there's 18 oh now now we've got a
problem because if you put 18 over there

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330
problem because if you put 18 over there
 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.810
problem because if you put 18 over there
there's no longer a way to go through

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820
there's no longer a way to go through
 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.720
there's no longer a way to go through
the whole network going through every

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:21.730
the whole network going through every
 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:23.640
the whole network going through every
single number once and once only because

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650
single number once and once only because
 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.350
single number once and once only because
we've got a tail here sticking off and

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360
we've got a tail here sticking off and
 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.610
we've got a tail here sticking off and
we've got a little tail sticking here

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:26.620
we've got a little tail sticking here
 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.880
we've got a little tail sticking here
and if we start here and go that way we

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:29.890
and if we start here and go that way we
 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:31.590
and if we start here and go that way we
can never get back to 18

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:31.600
can never get back to 18
 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.300
can never get back to 18
we start here we can never go back for

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310
we start here we can never go back for
 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.940
we start here we can never go back for
these guys so we've broken it so it

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:35.950
these guys so we've broken it so it
 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:39.870
these guys so we've broken it so it
works for all the numbers from 15 to 17

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880
works for all the numbers from 15 to 17
 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.960
works for all the numbers from 15 to 17
and then 18 breaks it but what if it

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:42.970
and then 18 breaks it but what if it
 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:44.100
and then 18 breaks it but what if it
works again after that

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110
works again after that
 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.550
works again after that
so we'd call this a graph in mathematics

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560
so we'd call this a graph in mathematics
 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.410
so we'd call this a graph in mathematics
and graph theory is what we're kind of

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:49.420
and graph theory is what we're kind of
 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:51.240
and graph theory is what we're kind of
using to solve this puzzle and we're

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250
using to solve this puzzle and we're
 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.910
using to solve this puzzle and we're
looking for a path a path there's any

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:53.920
looking for a path a path there's any
 

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.890
looking for a path a path there's any
kind of journey which doesn't go through

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:55.900
kind of journey which doesn't go through
 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.670
kind of journey which doesn't go through
the same vertex more than once and if we

00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680
the same vertex more than once and if we
 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.020
the same vertex more than once and if we
have a path that goes through every

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030
have a path that goes through every
 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:02.640
have a path that goes through every
single vertex then it's called a

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:02.650
single vertex then it's called a
 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.530
single vertex then it's called a
Hamiltonian path and so to solve this

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:04.540
Hamiltonian path and so to solve this
 

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:05.940
Hamiltonian path and so to solve this
puzzle you're looking for the

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:05.950
puzzle you're looking for the
 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:07.560
puzzle you're looking for the
Hamiltonian path which goes all the way

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:07.570
Hamiltonian path which goes all the way
 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.530
Hamiltonian path which goes all the way
through the graph so let's try adding on

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:10.540
through the graph so let's try adding on
 

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:14.310
through the graph so let's try adding on
a few more numbers and see if we can get

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:14.320
a few more numbers and see if we can get
 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.500
a few more numbers and see if we can get
to work for a bigger value if I add 19

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:16.510
to work for a bigger value if I add 19
 

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:19.350
to work for a bigger value if I add 19
over here that doesn't solve our two

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.360
over here that doesn't solve our two
 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.440
over here that doesn't solve our two
tails problem over there so as long as

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:22.450
tails problem over there so as long as
 

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:25.800
tails problem over there so as long as
this exists there are no solutions 20

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:25.810
this exists there are no solutions 20
 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:27.960
this exists there are no solutions 20
doesn't help Oh actually let's now

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:27.970
doesn't help Oh actually let's now
 

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:32.280
doesn't help Oh actually let's now
solved one tail problem so we can come

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:32.290
solved one tail problem so we can come
 

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:34.890
solved one tail problem so we can come
in here oh babe if we come in here we

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:34.900
in here oh babe if we come in here we
 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.180
in here oh babe if we come in here we
either go around that way or we go

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:36.190
either go around that way or we go
 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:37.770
either go around that way or we go
around that way because we had it have

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:37.780
around that way because we had it have
 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:39.530
around that way because we had it have
to come off and do the rest of this and

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:39.540
to come off and do the rest of this and
 

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:42.030
to come off and do the rest of this and
because of this bottleneck here and here

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:42.040
because of this bottleneck here and here
 

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.700
because of this bottleneck here and here
you do one way if you loop around then

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:44.710
you do one way if you loop around then
 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:46.530
you do one way if you loop around then
you can't get out so that's still not

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:46.540
you can't get out so that's still not
 

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.060
you can't get out so that's still not
solvable we need another way out of this

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:48.070
solvable we need another way out of this
 

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:49.700
solvable we need another way out of this
loop before we can do it

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:49.710
loop before we can do it
 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:53.130

here because it links 15 which I'm gonna

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:56.770
here because it links 15 which I'm gonna
 

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:00.330
here because it links 15 which I'm gonna
run under there too for so these are

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:00.340
run under there too for so these are
 

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:01.590
run under there too for so these are
crossing but that's that's not a new

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:01.600
crossing but that's that's not a new
 

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.270
crossing but that's that's not a new
vertex right obviously I'm just drawing

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:03.280

the links 22 links up 3-2 14 does that

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:07.090
the links 22 links up 3-2 14 does that
 

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:08.490
the links 22 links up 3-2 14 does that
get us out of our problem because we can

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:08.500
get us out of our problem because we can
 

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.010
get us out of our problem because we can
come through here and out but then we

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:11.020
come through here and out but then we
 

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:12.930
come through here and out but then we
can't get ours - it's still not doable

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:12.940
can't get ours - it's still not doable
 

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:17.460
can't get ours - it's still not doable
it can be done once we get to 23 so if

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:17.470
it can be done once we get to 23 so if
 

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:21.840
it can be done once we get to 23 so if
we put 23 in let's pop it down there now

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:21.850
we put 23 in let's pop it down there now
 

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:25.590
we put 23 in let's pop it down there now
it is possible to trace all the way

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:25.600
it is possible to trace all the way
 

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.410
it is possible to trace all the way
through this network show shall we give

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:28.420
through this network show shall we give
 

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:31.770
through this network show shall we give
it a go I have spoken too soon okay we

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:31.780
it a go I have spoken too soon okay we
 

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:33.630
it a go I have spoken too soon okay we
can work this out so okay see if we can

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:33.640
can work this out so okay see if we can
 

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:34.860
can work this out so okay see if we can
do this you go start from 18 because

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:34.870
do this you go start from 18 because
 

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:36.810
do this you go start from 18 because
that's like a little tail over here if

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:36.820
that's like a little tail over here if
 

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:39.000
that's like a little tail over here if
we come in here and we all the way

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:39.010
we come in here and we all the way
 

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:40.230
we come in here and we all the way
around here

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:40.240
around here
 

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.870
around here
I suspect we need to mop up these

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:42.880
I suspect we need to mop up these
 

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.940
I suspect we need to mop up these
because if we leave any of these behind

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:44.950
because if we leave any of these behind
 

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:45.360
because if we leave any of these behind
we're gonna be

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:45.370
we're gonna be
 

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:47.370
we're gonna be
troubles that's come down take those get

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:47.380
troubles that's come down take those get
 

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:49.920
troubles that's come down take those get
into here come up here oh yeah here we

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:49.930
into here come up here oh yeah here we
 

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:55.230
into here come up here oh yeah here we
go then we go across 21 15 10 6 1917 8 1

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:55.240
go then we go across 21 15 10 6 1917 8 1
 

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.930
go then we go across 21 15 10 6 1917 8 1
and there you go so it's possible to

00:07:57.930 --> 00:07:57.940
and there you go so it's possible to
 

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:01.680
and there you go so it's possible to
find a Hamiltonian path on the graph as

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:01.690
find a Hamiltonian path on the graph as
 

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:04.920
find a Hamiltonian path on the graph as
soon as we add node 23 but very sadly

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:04.930
soon as we add node 23 but very sadly
 

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:08.520
soon as we add node 23 but very sadly
when we add node 24 it breaks again so

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:08.530
when we add node 24 it breaks again so
 

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:15.000
when we add node 24 it breaks again so
24 joins 1 to 12 24 goes there and then

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:15.010
24 joins 1 to 12 24 goes there and then
 

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:20.700
24 joins 1 to 12 24 goes there and then
one thinks to 12th and now it's broken

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:20.710
one thinks to 12th and now it's broken
 

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:24.360
one thinks to 12th and now it's broken
again but when you add 25 its fixed

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:24.370
again but when you add 25 its fixed
 

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:27.300
again but when you add 25 its fixed
again and it then works for 26 it works

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:27.310
again and it then works for 26 it works
 

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:30.029
again and it then works for 26 it works
with 27 and it works all the way up so

00:08:30.029 --> 00:08:30.039
with 27 and it works all the way up so
 

00:08:30.039 --> 00:08:34.589
with 27 and it works all the way up so
we think as far as we're aware from 25

00:08:34.589 --> 00:08:34.599
we think as far as we're aware from 25
 

00:08:34.599 --> 00:08:37.290
we think as far as we're aware from 25
onwards it works for every possible

00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:37.300
onwards it works for every possible
 

00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:40.680
onwards it works for every possible
value you can somehow find a path

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:40.690
value you can somehow find a path
 

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:43.200
value you can somehow find a path
