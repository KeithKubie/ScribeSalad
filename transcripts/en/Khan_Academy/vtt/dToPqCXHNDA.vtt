00:00:00.703 --> 00:00:02.184
- [Instructor] Let's
do a few more examples

00:00:02.184 --> 00:00:04.675
of thinking of strategies
for dividing decimals.

00:00:04.675 --> 00:00:06.016
In the future, we're gonna come up with

00:00:06.016 --> 00:00:07.533
a more systematic way of doing it,

00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:08.756
but it's really important

00:00:08.756 --> 00:00:10.567
to come up with some of these strategies

00:00:10.567 --> 00:00:13.189
because it gives you an
intuition for dividing decimals.

00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:14.732
And frankly, it's an easier thing to do,

00:00:14.732 --> 00:00:16.423
especially when you're trying

00:00:16.423 --> 00:00:18.630
to eventually divide
decimals in your head.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.423
So let's say we want
to figure out what six

00:00:22.423 --> 00:00:25.673
divided by 0.2, or 2/10, is.

00:00:27.745 --> 00:00:31.432
Pause the video, and see
if you can figure it out.

00:00:31.432 --> 00:00:33.775
So we've already explored
multiple strategies.

00:00:33.775 --> 00:00:36.556
One strategy is, well, let's
express this as a fraction.

00:00:36.556 --> 00:00:39.639
This is the same thing as 6 over 0.2,

00:00:42.905 --> 00:00:46.095
And maybe we can multiply the
numerator and the denominator

00:00:46.095 --> 00:00:48.936
by some value so we're not
dealing with decimals anymore.

00:00:48.936 --> 00:00:50.966
And, if you wanna get rid of
the decimal in the bottom,

00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:54.589
we have 2/10, well we can
multiply the bottom by 10.

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:56.168
But if we multiply the bottom by 10

00:00:56.168 --> 00:00:58.534
we need to multiply the numerator by 10.

00:00:58.534 --> 00:00:59.937
So essentially we're multiplying

00:00:59.937 --> 00:01:02.167
this fraction by 10/10,
which is just multiplying

00:01:02.167 --> 00:01:05.045
it by 1, so it doesn't change its value.

00:01:05.045 --> 00:01:08.712
So this is going to be
equal to 60, so 6, 0,

00:01:11.277 --> 00:01:14.664
over 2/10 times 10, let's go and move

00:01:14.664 --> 00:01:16.792
the decimal one to the right,

00:01:16.792 --> 00:01:19.931
and that's just going to be equal to 2.

00:01:19.931 --> 00:01:22.264
Now what is 60 divided by 2?

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.936
Well, 60 divided by 2 is
fairly straightforward,

00:01:26.936 --> 00:01:29.533
6 divided by 2 is 3 so 60 divided by 2

00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:31.783
is going to be equal to 30.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.658
So that's 30. And so we're done.

00:01:35.658 --> 00:01:37.541
Now another strategy is
you could've thought of

00:01:37.541 --> 00:01:39.848
all of these numbers in terms of tenths.

00:01:39.848 --> 00:01:44.309
You could've said this is
6, do that orange color,

00:01:44.309 --> 00:01:48.142
You could've said this
is 6 tenths divided by,

00:01:49.907 --> 00:01:53.324
oh, let me be careful, this is 60 tenths,

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.813
6, is 60 tenths,

00:01:59.696 --> 00:02:03.196
60 tenths divided by 2 tenths is equal to,

00:02:09.257 --> 00:02:11.150
well if 60 is something
and I were to divide

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.803
it into groups of two of that something

00:02:12.803 --> 00:02:14.446
I would have 30 groups.

00:02:14.446 --> 00:02:17.321
That's going to be equal to 30.

00:02:17.321 --> 00:02:19.713
Let's do another example.

00:02:19.713 --> 00:02:21.836
This will be our most involved one,

00:02:21.836 --> 00:02:23.349
before we really try to show you

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:27.037
the standard way of dividing decimals.

00:02:27.037 --> 00:02:29.467
Let's say we wanted to compute

00:02:29.467 --> 00:02:33.300
4.2, or 4 and two tenths,
divided by 3 tenths.

00:02:37.462 --> 00:02:41.034
Pause the video and see if
you can figure that out.

00:02:41.034 --> 00:02:42.440
Well you've already seen multiple

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.896
techniques for tackling this.

00:02:43.896 --> 00:02:45.960
It never hurts to try to
write this as a fraction.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.932
So this, you could write it as 4.2

00:02:48.932 --> 00:02:50.599
divided by 3 tenths.

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.194
And now we could try to
get rid of the decimals.

00:02:55.194 --> 00:02:57.192
Now the best way to do
that I could imagine,

00:02:57.192 --> 00:02:59.021
I have tenths here, I have tenths here,

00:02:59.021 --> 00:03:02.067
If I multiply the numerator
and the denominator by 10,

00:03:02.067 --> 00:03:04.668
that might help out a lot,
because the numerator,

00:03:04.668 --> 00:03:07.448
this would move the
decimal one to the right,

00:03:07.448 --> 00:03:09.605
so the numerator I would get 42,

00:03:09.605 --> 00:03:13.188
4.2 times 10 is 42,
over 3 tenths times 10,

00:03:16.205 --> 00:03:19.114
well that is going to be equal to 3.

00:03:19.114 --> 00:03:21.697
And so what is 42 divided by 3?

00:03:22.785 --> 00:03:24.906
Well, there's multiple ways to do that,

00:03:24.906 --> 00:03:26.491
you can try to do it in your head,

00:03:26.491 --> 00:03:28.229
or you just try to actually do

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:30.766
a little bit of medium long division,

00:03:30.766 --> 00:03:32.625
this shouldn't be too long.

00:03:32.625 --> 00:03:34.926
So let's see, 3 goes into 4 one time,

00:03:34.926 --> 00:03:38.176
1 times 3 is 3, subtract, 4 minus 3 is,

00:03:40.426 --> 00:03:42.366
oh why did I write 43, I knew something

00:03:42.366 --> 00:03:43.533
was fishy, 42.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.676
3 goes into 42, my
brain is malfunctioning.

00:03:47.676 --> 00:03:51.329
Alright, 3 goes into 4
one time, 1 times 3 is 3,

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:55.144
you subtract 4 minus 3
is 1, bring down the 2,

00:03:55.144 --> 00:03:58.063
3 goes into 12 four times.

00:03:58.063 --> 00:03:59.980
So this is equal to 14.

00:04:00.895 --> 00:04:02.449
And so this one right over here

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:04.127
is going to be equal to 14.

00:04:04.127 --> 00:04:05.925
And just like we saw in the last example,

00:04:05.925 --> 00:04:09.425
you could also think of this as 42 tenths,

00:04:11.191 --> 00:04:12.858
divided by 3 tenths,

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.386
in which case 42 tenths,

00:04:19.386 --> 00:04:21.344
42 of something divided into groups of 3

00:04:21.344 --> 00:04:22.793
of that something,
you're gonna end up with

00:04:22.793 --> 00:04:26.043
14 groups, you're gonna end up with 14.

00:04:27.295 --> 00:04:29.034
So hopefully you appreciate these ideas,

00:04:29.034 --> 00:04:31.199
express it as a fraction,
see if you can multiply

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:33.893
the numerator and
denominator by the same value

00:04:33.893 --> 00:04:36.362
so maybe the decimals get eliminated,

00:04:36.362 --> 00:04:38.436
maybe you can think of these numbers

00:04:38.436 --> 00:04:40.761
in terms of tenths, or hundredths,

00:04:40.761 --> 00:04:42.550
and then think of it that way.

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.984
And any of these combinations are gonna be

00:04:44.984 --> 00:04:46.433
effective strategies, or hopefully

00:04:46.433 --> 00:04:48.176
effective strategies, for dividing

00:04:48.176 --> 00:04:49.644
decimals or dividing numbers where

00:04:49.644 --> 00:04:51.859
the quotient might be a decimal.

00:04:51.859 --> 00:04:53.142
And in future videos we're gonna learn

00:04:53.142 --> 00:04:54.171
a more standard systematic way of

00:04:54.171 --> 00:04:57.138
doing it but this is always valuable.

00:04:57.138 --> 00:04:59.724
I still, if someone walked up to me on

00:04:59.724 --> 00:05:03.017
the street and said
what's 4.2 divided by 0.3,

00:05:03.017 --> 00:05:05.105
this is how I would actually do it.

00:05:05.105 --> 00:05:06.921
I would say okay that's the same

00:05:06.921 --> 00:05:09.344
thing as 42 divided by 3, and then

00:05:09.344 --> 00:05:12.250
I would say okay, 3
goes into 42, let's see,

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.018
3 times 10 is 30, and
then 3 times 4 is 12,

00:05:16.018 --> 00:05:18.035
yeah that would be 14 times.

00:05:18.035 --> 00:05:19.688
That's how my brain would do it if

00:05:19.688 --> 00:05:21.871
I was trying to do it in my head.
