00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:11.180
It’s a skill that’s just as important, but far less studied, than knowing how to start things off.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:17.040
We’re typically appalling at it. We mumble, we delay, we become strange, we hedge…

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.660
And there’s one reason we make such a mess of it.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:25.340
It’s not that we’re inept or dumb or cruel. It’s that we’re trying to be kind.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.920
That's the origin of all our ineptness, stupidity and cruelty.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.660
We hesitate to be cold and try to be nice because we are sentimental.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:42.200
The essence of sentimentality is the desire to be liked, even by those you don’t like and can no longer be bothered with.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:49.060
It’s a narcissistic longing to continue to receive the emotion of love without wanting to pay for it.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.780
But kindness has no role whatsoever to play at the charred end of relationships.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.140
Being sweet and understanding merely prolongs the torture for the other person.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:06.620
If we're being so tender, is it really possible that we truly mean the dark things we are ostensibly saying?

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.640
Could we be so loving and at the same time, calling it a day?

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:17.160
We need above all else to kill hope. But instead, too often, we just waffle.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:25.580
Marcel Proust wisely observed: ‘At the end of relationships, it's the one who is not in love who makes the tender speeches.’

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:31.260
Parting lovers may end up in the grotesque situation of one person crying because they are being left,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.320
and the other crying because of the distress that announcing the departure has caused them...

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.180
tears that are mistaken by the abandoned party for signs of care.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.360
The kindest way to end a relationship is just to make extremely brutal speeches...

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:52.480
of a sort that will leave the other person in no doubt at all that you’re not an especially nice person.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:58.760
The truly courageous way to leave is to allow yourself to be hated by someone who loves you.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.760
That's generosity.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.620
There’s no excuse for delay.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:09.740
Don’t imagine that you’re doing someone a favour by dragging out how long they can persist in the benign illusion that you want them.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.680
Their real priority is to stop wasting their lives.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:19.420
Don’t imagine that they won’t ever find anyone else like you: they may believe that now and might even sweetly tell you so.

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.340
But they won’t believe it when they finally understand who you actually are.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:31.980
Real kindness means getting out – even though the holiday has been booked and it will be terribly awkward to tell everyone at this late stage.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.460
There’s nothing at all wrong with deciding that someone isn’t for you.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.100
There is something very wrong with ruining large chunks of someone else’s life

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.980
while you squeamishly and sentimentally hesitate to get out of the way.
