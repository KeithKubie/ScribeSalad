00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.590 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Rowell: Michael Cunningham
has written a new book called A Wild

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.550
Swan: And Other Tales and he's
brought his friend Yuko Shimizu

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.960
who has done extraordinary
illustrations for the book.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.630
You know, like you
all I know Michael

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.920
through his work and
through his books.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.480
I've been lucky because I was also
able to publish some of his fiction

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.000
and nonfiction over the years as
an editor, but also I just wanted

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.120 position:56%
to pass on it was exactly 20 years
ago that I got to study with Michael

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.110
for a week at the Provincetown
Fine Arts Work Center.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.430
And so what you do is send in
two short stories, you know,

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.760
as an audition and then you
hope that they go over well

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.560
and that accepts you, so it was my
good fortune to have that happen.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.830 position:56%
So, you know, we were already in awe
of Michael because of the two books

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.740
that we knew, and so from
the very first day he came in

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.160
and he started talking about this
other book that he was working on

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.320
and he said, you know it's
got Virginia Woolf in it

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.400
and it has ghosts, I don't
really know what I'm doing,

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.530
but I don't know I
kind of love it and I'm

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.180
into it and, you know, we'll see.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.350
Who knows what it's going to be?

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.320
And for those of us
aspiring writers, you know,

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.940
just to hear an author like this,
you know, won't give us any crumbs

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.900
at all was just remarkable.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.030
And, you know, he was kind
of showing us what it is

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.670
to be vulnerable and
to also have a project

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.660
that you're not necessarily
always in charge of

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.300
but the work is the
thing and he said,

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.060
you know I'm just it feels right,
I don't know where it's going.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.310
And so we were just kind
of knocked out by that.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:46.110
You know, we felt in those days
like we were part of his circle.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.790
Michael said a couple of things
during that week that I just want

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.030
to share with you because they've
stayed with me ever since and one

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.340
of them was, you know, he was
just talking about his writing

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.400
and at some point he said that he
basically considered any paragraph

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.170
that he wrote to be
or what he wanted it

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.050
to be was a bouquet of sentences.

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.610
I never heard that before and
I've never heard it after.

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.060
And if you know Michael's work
you know just how true that rings

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.620
because Michael is such
an incredible stylist

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.550
and he shapes his sentences
so beautifully

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.710
and what he was saying was the
effect of the paragraph, you know,

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.730 position:56%
it's not that every sentence is
trying to out do the other sentence.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.030
It's how you put them together.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.020
It's the effect, and that whole
week he was so trying to kind

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.190
of push us toward imagery that
was startling and original.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.560
And he said, you know, if you write
a line and it says lips are as red

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.670
as apples, then you know
that's not good enough.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.930 position:56%
You have to push yourself, you
don't want anything that's familiar.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.730
And so that had a huge impact
on me as an aspiring writer

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.760
and the other thing a little bit
more perverse that he shared was,

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.690
so you know, you send in these
two short stories and at the end

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.470
of the time or at some point in the
time he talks to you about them.

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.100
And so we were always
in anticipation

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.160
of have you had your
time with Michael yet?

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.650
You know and so mine was at the
very end, and so we sat down

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:16.190
and he had my two manuscripts
and he said, so okay, okay.

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.200
He read them and he said, you know,
basically I think that this story

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.830
and he held the other one up and he
said I think that this story should

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.290
and I wasn't quite sure
where he was going.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.800
And I can't say the actual word
that he said, but since we're

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.080
in Washington I'm going
to choose have relations.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.240
[laughter] So he said
basically I think

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.700
that this story should have
relations with this story

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.920
and what comes out of that
is what you should be doing.

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:47.730
[laughter] So when
you've heard something

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.480
like that you can never quite
look at eight and a half

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.170
by eleven paper quite
in the same way.

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.570 position:56%
[laughter] But I also understood
what he was saying and so, you know,

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:00.100
in many ways what I've been trying
to do ever since then is work

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.440
on the baby for those two stories.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.320
[laughter] Anyway, so
as you know, Michael,

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.640
that book that he was talking
about then went on to be The Hours,

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.620
went on to win the Pulitzer Prize.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:16.610 position:56%
He is the author of other books such
as Specimen Days and Darkness Falls

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:21.090
and The Snow Queen and a
beautiful book about Provincetown

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.880
and the spirit and
beauty of that town.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.420
And Yuko whose work I mean
basically you know her work

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:29.760
from everywhere you look.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.930
She has had work in Rolling
Stone and The New Yorker,

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.960
the cover of books,
Time, and Newsweek,

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.390
but also she's created
this incredible poster.

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.760
[applause] So hopefully she can
talk to us a little bit about that.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.480
So let's welcome them to the stage.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.510 position:56%
Michael Cunningham and Yuko Shimizu.

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.510
[ Applause ]

00:04:50.510 --> 00:05:24.040
[ Background Sounds ]

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.340
&gt;&gt; Michael Cunningham: Are we set?

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:26.640
Are we audible?

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:27.940
&gt;&gt; David Rowell: Can
everyone hear us?

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.240
Yes?

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.540 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michael Cunningham: Great, great.

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:31.840
David, thank you.

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.140
That was so by the way, you
turned out awfully well.

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.130
I have the temerity
to be proud of you.

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:41.730
Am I tell me if I'm not
audible in the back, okay?

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:45.010
But, yeah, yeah.

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:49.100 position:56%
20 years ago two stories got married

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.950
and produced generations
of younger stories.

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:54.250
&gt;&gt; David Rowell: Right.

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.770
&gt;&gt; Michael Cunningham: I
remember that conversation.

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.570
&gt;&gt; David Rowell: So stories,
I mean you know a lot of us

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:01.810
who are short story
lovers have wondered

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:05.380
when Michael might ever
publish a short story collection

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:06.990
and here we have it.

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.340
This is the book.

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.660
And so basically I kind
of think of this book

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:18.010 position:56%
as Michael being a great jazz
pianist who is playing the standards

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:21.980
which is to say there are
some stories that, you know,

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.720
he maybe plays a little
bit straighter,

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:30.170
some he totally reverses, some
he bends the bridge or the verse,

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:31.930 position:56%
and some he just totally reimagines.

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.710
So I mean it's thrilling to see
what he does with each story.

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:36.010
Each story is different.

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:40.280
So one of the things,
Michael, I wonder about is

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:45.810
so in this book you have kings
and jesters and spells and castles

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:48.500
but you also have clothing
my Marc Jacobs.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.800
&gt;&gt; Michael Cunningham: Right.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.660 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Rowell: And subway
turnstiles and apartments with cable

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.000
and a part, you know, bars
where people go for hookups,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.230
and so I'm wondering if
you felt like you had

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:03.390
to establish any kind
of rules going into it.

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:07.040
How the contemporary would
speak to or intersect

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.240
with the traditional kingdom.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.870
&gt;&gt; Michael Cunningham: You know,
that was one of those things

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:13.790
that sort of the came
out as I wrote.

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:18.370
You know, these are these
sort of reinterpreted,

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:22.460
reimagined fairy tales and
as far as I can tell most

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:28.340
of the fairy tales I knew as a kid,
most of the ones I sort of retold

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:34.860
in this book are medieval
kings, castles, you know,

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:39.200
yeah sort of vaguely 13 to 1400s.

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:44.780
And there was something
it's hard to some

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:47.610
of this stuff is hard
to be specific about.

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:54.690 position:56%
It felt a little kitsch setting them
in their original fairy tale time,

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:59.170
but then it also felt
sort of contrived

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:01.820
to set them in contemporary times.

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:05.590
You know, you're kind of damned if
you do, damned this way and damned

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:10.260
that way and I thought if I
if there are kings and castles

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:14.680
and laundromats and strip
malls, maybe it will just sort

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.820
of lift them out of time.

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:18.120
&gt;&gt; David Rowell: Uh huh.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.430
&gt;&gt; Michael Cunningham: So
that by the juxtaposition

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:27.210
of of our lives now and the 14th
century, we're not sort of thinking

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:30.330
so much about the time in
which these stories take place.

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:31.630
&gt;&gt; David Rowell: Uh huh, uh huh.

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:32.930
&gt;&gt; Michael Cunningham:
It could be any time.

00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:34.230
&gt;&gt; David Rowell: Sure.

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:37.970
And so were the stories completely
finished before you turned to Yuko,

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:40.340
or was she brought into
the process at some point?

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:44.040
Or talk about how she
became part of the book.

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:46.050
&gt;&gt; Michael Cunningham: Well, I
would love to turn it over to Yuko,

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:51.720
but the stories were pretty
much finished and it was clear

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:55.620
that a book of fairy
tales needs illustrations.

00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:02.630
And we had a hard time
finding anybody who felt right.

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:07.750
The book was published by Farrar,
Strauss and Giroux, a great

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:11.270
and venerable publishing
house and I sort of imagined

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:17.010
that they would have reams
of illustrators to call.

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:18.310
They don't.

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:19.720
[laughter] They don't really.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:23.870
They had some children's
books illustrators but nobody

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:29.090
who felt I kind of had a
vague idea of the sensibility

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:35.470
which would be sort of you
know perverse but beautiful.

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:41.660
I had a rough sense of the
artists we were looking for

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:43.340
and we weren't finding that person,

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:47.570
and I finally just
Googled illustrators.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.430
[laughter] And came up with Yuko.

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:53.120
&gt;&gt; Yuko Shimizu: Wait is
that how you found me?

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.450
&gt;&gt; Michael Cunningham: Yeah.

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:55.910
[laughter] They didn't
tell you that.

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:57.250
&gt;&gt; Yuko Shimizu: No, no, no.

00:09:57.250 --> 00:09:58.900
&gt;&gt; Michael Cunningham:
I Googled you.

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:01.010
&gt;&gt; Yuko Shimizu: Oh,
I had zero idea.

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:04.400 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michael Cunningham: No one at God
damned FSG was doing shit about it.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:05.830
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:08.420
It's turrets like I will
try to watch my language.

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:12.360
&gt;&gt; Yuko Shimizu: I got a call
from the cover art director

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:17.010
in [inaudible] FSG who I
actually had worked with in past.

00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:18.630
And he, you know, he mentioned

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:23.340
like you know Michael wrote these
short stories and he want this

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:25.960
to be illustrated and what
do you think about it.

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.650
And like we think, you
know, you're a perfect match

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:31.930
and like I just assumed he
found me because, you know,

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:35.840
I have worked with him before, but
it was a completely different kind

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.160
of book because I'm a
Japanese and I do a lot

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:42.440
of you know Japanese period
style art and it was one

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:47.800
of [inaudible] books so it
was very period Japanese,

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.810
woodblock print type of work.

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:51.110
It's very different.

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:52.410
&gt;&gt; Michael Cunningham: Yeah, yeah.

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:53.900
&gt;&gt; Yuko Shimizu: So I'm finding
out something very interesting.

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:56.210
&gt;&gt; Michael Cunningham:
I know, I know, I know.

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:58.870
I don't mind if Rodrigo
took credit for it,

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:01.330
but in fact, it was me, girl.

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:03.140
I found you all by myself.

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:04.440
[laughter]

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:05.740
&gt;&gt; Yuko Shimizu: Thank you.

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:07.040
[laughter]

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.340
&gt;&gt; David Rowell: So

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:10.180
&gt;&gt; Michael Cunningham: Just
quickly there was it's incredible

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:12.260
work online.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:16.280
It was very Asian, but I
thought oh, the sensibility

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:17.710
that doesn't that's no problem.

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:24.290
You know, that's anybody who can
do what you can do can do anything.

00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:25.590
&gt;&gt; Yuko Shimizu: Thank you.

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:28.080
&gt;&gt; David Rowell: So, Yuko,
you know we all kind of grew

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:31.840
up with those stories but
also a style of illustration

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:37.410
with those stories often, and I
wonder how you went about kind

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:39.660
of sorting through your
own sense of parameters.

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:42.530 position:56%
Did you feel liberated from the kind

00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:45.420
of traditional approach the
way these are often illustrated

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:48.990
or did you feel like you
needed to work within that?

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:52.030
&gt;&gt; Yuko Shimizu: So it was a
very interesting creative process

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:54.970
because nowadays, you know,
everyone knows in any field

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:58.190
like nobody have meetings.

00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:01.040
I mean especially if you're a
freelancer and nobody calls.

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:07.120
Like everything is on email and
so I don't see any of my clients.

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:11.080
I don't see any of my
collaborators for a very long time,

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:16.040
but FSG actually called
us to be in the meeting.

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:19.680
So we had multiple meetings
throughout the stages,

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:22.710
different stages, maybe
three or four times.

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:24.010
&gt;&gt; Michael Cunningham: Yeah.

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:25.310
&gt;&gt; Yuko Shimizu: Over
the course of start

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:29.040
to finish initially
like let's sit and talk.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:32.240
You know like what are you
thinking, what Michael is thinking,

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.000 position:56%
what we as a publisher are thinking.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.860
Let's come together and talk.

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:41.840
And so that was a start and then
also Michael said like Yuko,

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:44.070
I'm an artist, you know I write

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:46.630
and that's what I do
and you're an artist.

00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:51.580
You draw, that's what you know
how to do, so I picked you

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:56.670
and I completely trust what you
do and you come up with something,

00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:58.510
you know, that you feel is right.

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:03.890
And of course then like a meeting
follows and I went to Books

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:07.530
of Wonder which is a
children's bookstore

00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:14.370
and which is probably mostly known
as the model of You've Got Mail.

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:16.910
That's where Meg Ryan works.

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:19.150 position:56%
[laughter] And it's an old location.

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:23.610
I asked them actually, it's an
old old nice children's bookstore

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:28.650
and actually it's right on
the first floor of FSG office,

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:30.520
so I went in there and they have

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:33.840
like different sections not
just a contemporary kids books

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:36.860
but they have a rare book
section and they also

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:39.140
that have republished old books.

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:43.510
So I read Michael's
almost completely finished,

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:45.170
you did a little bit of editing

00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:48.840
but it was almost completely
finished set of stories,

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:55.720
and it feels like it's right to
use sort of like turn of the 19th

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:58.850
to 20th century children's
book from, you know,

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:00.810
mainly Europe like England.

00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:07.140 position:56%
Like really dark line based work
that was popular around that period.

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:10.140
And because I do black
and white line work

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:14.380
and okay this direction my work
and I went in before the meeting

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:18.170
and bought whole bunch of books
from time period and then brought

00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:20.810
that in and we started talking.

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:22.110
&gt;&gt; David Rowell: Uh huh.

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:23.410
&gt;&gt; Yuko Shimizu: And then
from there, you know,

00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:25.910
like every time I do
some sketches we meet

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:28.850
and every time I do some
more finished we meet

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:33.050
and then gradually moved forward.

00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:36.290
&gt;&gt; David Rowell: And, Michael,
were there images or things

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:40.670
that she had seized on within
your stories that surprised you?

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:42.190
&gt;&gt; Michael Cunningham: Yes.

00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:44.930
And in the best possible sense.

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:46.620
You want to be surprised.

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:51.930
You hope to be pleasantly
surprised and yeah, yeah.

00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:59.360 position:56%
As Yuko said, I felt like, you know,
I just want do whatever you want.

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:06.060
I mean although this the
prose came before the images.

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:09.000
I wanted it to be a collaboration.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.280
I wanted Yuko to use the
stories as a departure point

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:19.670
for whatever she wanted to
do, and they started coming

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:22.670
in and they were ravishing.

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:25.250
I said I just showed them
to people and say, okay,

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:28.000
you're not going to
believe this one.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.410
And I know you we talk about
it, there were a few times

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:36.100
where you thought either this or
that and we talked about that,

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:38.310
but essentially what's

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:45.000 position:56%
in the published version are exactly
the drawings you you produced.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.070
They're fantastic.

00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:48.370
&gt;&gt; Yuko Shimizu: Thank you.

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:51.940
&gt;&gt; Michael Cunningham: They're it
was really interesting to me to see

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:56.390
which image from the
story spoke to you.

00:15:56.390 --> 00:16:02.720
And I feel like we talk about
two stories getting married,

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:07.890
I feel like this book is a
sort of marriage of the stories

00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:11.270
and your illustration which
are distinctly related

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:16.490
but the illustrations are not
subsidiaries of the stories.

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:18.520
The illustrations are
almost a book of their own.

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:19.820
&gt;&gt; David Rowell: Uh huh, uh huh.

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:21.230
So let's talk about
some of these stories.

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:24.670
I mean some of the tales that
you take on are Snow White.

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:25.970
&gt;&gt; Michael Cunningham: Uh huh.

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:28.030 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Rowell: And Rumpelstiltskin
and Jack and the Beanstalk

00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:32.490
and Beauty and the
Beast and Monkey's Paw

00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:35.010
which is not doesn't
always show up in those.

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:36.310
&gt;&gt; Michael Cunningham:
That's a bit of a cheat.

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:37.610
I know. That's not
really a fairy tale.

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:39.220
I just figured it's my
book, I can do what I want.

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:42.320
&gt;&gt; David Rowell: Of course.

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:47.130
[laughter] So I want to talk
about and you, I'll take your cues

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:49.600
because there may be some specifics
about stories that you don't want

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:53.120
to give away or reveal,
but I'd love to talk

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:56.390
about the Rumpelstiltskin story
if we could a little bit because

00:16:56.390 --> 00:17:00.740
and one of the things that's so
great about this book is, you know,

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:04.260
the villains the people
we're not rooting

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:09.640
for in these books are generally,
you know, kind of one dimensional

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:11.990
in the stories that we have read.

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:13.290
&gt;&gt; Michael Cunningham:
Right, right, right, right.

00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:16.700 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Rowell: And so what Michael
has done consistently is he's taken

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:18.840
some of those characters
and it's almost as if that's

00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:22.020
where his sympathies lie, or
at least there's a curiosity

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:24.650
and he steps back and
he says, well lets kind

00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:26.050
of maybe probe a little bit

00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:28.510
about how this character
maybe got to this point.

00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:32.490 position:56%
And Rumpelstiltskin so you know with
Rumpelstiltskin there is that notion

00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:35.920
that he wants the woman
who becomes the queen,

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:38.060
he wants the queen's
daughter and of course we grew

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:39.360
up thinking, well how horrible.

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:41.000
Why should Rumpelstiltskin
have a child?

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.270
He's single, you know,
he's a hunchback.

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:46.010
[laughter] He's you
know he's small, right.

00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:50.670
That would be the worst thing,
and so and Michael's take,

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:53.750
Michael from the very
beginning of that story says,

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:55.700
why shouldn't he have a child?

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:59.470
What's wrong with Rumpelstiltskin
wanting a child?

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:00.770
&gt;&gt; Michael Cunningham: Yeah.

00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:04.260
&gt;&gt; David Rowell: So did that
impulse to kind of shift

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:09.630
in some ways the point not the
point of view so much but to focus

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:12.450
on the different character
than what we are used to,

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:17.290
was that a plan going
into the entire project?

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:21.110
&gt;&gt; Michael Cunningham: It was, you
know I hardly ever have anything

00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:27.070
as useful as a plan, but I have
a sort of sense of smell almost

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:29.640
about what I'm doing and then
it begins to reveal itself

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:32.130 position:56%
as some kind of something plan like.

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:38.750
And I think maybe the sort of
underlying notion of this book is,

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:41.380
as you say, the traditional
fairy tales

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:43.130
which I love, these are homages.

00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:46.860
They're not wiseacre
rifts on archaic forms.

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:48.160
&gt;&gt; David Rowell: Right.

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:49.460
There's something ironic, yes.

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:51.090
&gt;&gt; Michael Cunningham: These
are stories that I still love

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:58.010
and the characters are in fact
almost inevitably one-dimensional.

00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:00.740
They're evil or they're
good, you know.

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:05.860
They're virginal or they're corrupt
and without being so conscious

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:08.040
of it I guess I was thinking,

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:12.810
but what if they were all
more complicated than that?

00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:14.110
&gt;&gt; David Rowell: Right.

00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:17.880
&gt;&gt; Michael Cunningham: What if
I being a 21st century writer,

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:21.770
though I dwelt long in the 20th
century as well, I mean it's all

00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:29.270
about like most contemporary
fiction writers human complexity.

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:30.570
&gt;&gt; David Rowell: Uh huh.

00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:32.360
&gt;&gt; Michael Cunningham: There's
no good guy, there's no bad guy.

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.860
We're all the good
guy and the bad guy.

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:38.070
It depends on the day, it
depends on the situation.

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:41.530
And you mentioned earlier that some

00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:45.240
of the fairy tales hue pretty
closely to the originals

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:50.880
and others don't, and what I found
was it was kind of interesting.

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:58.850
That if you if you try to imagine
why Rumpelstiltskin would want a

00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:08.120
child so so much, what would
lead a girl to fall in love

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:14.260
with essentially a seven foot
yeti in a great coat and a saber?

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:17.610
If you follow the characters,

00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:20.970 position:56%
some of them demanded very different
versions of the traditional stories

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:24.680
and some of them made the
same story all over again.

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:25.980
&gt;&gt; David Rowell: Uh huh.

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:27.280
&gt;&gt; Michael Cunningham: Which
says something about destiny

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:29.970
that I'm not smart
enough to quite tackle.

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:31.560
But you know what I'm saying?

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:35.680
That some of the existing fairy
tales had room for characters

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:39.000
with free will and free
choice and so went exactly

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.190 position:56%
where the fairy tale went anyway and
some of them went somewhere else.

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:44.280
&gt;&gt; David Rowell: Uh huh, uh huh.

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:49.610
So I know that, Michael, as a child
your parents read these stories

00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:51.970
to you very often and they
meant a great deal to you.

00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:56.330
Yuko, I'm wondering what your
relationship was to these stories

00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:59.230
as a child or later in life or

00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:03.660
&gt;&gt; Yuko Shimizu: I my
parents did read a lot to me

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:07.240
and then also I was a bookworm.

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:12.670
You know like someone who it's
like after lunch outside it's sunny

00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:17.410
and everyone is going outside and
doing dodge ball and I'm the one

00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:21.990
who is staying inside and either
reading books or drawing pictures.

00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:23.290
&gt;&gt; Michael Cunningham:
Uh huh, uh huh.

00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:25.400
&gt;&gt; Yuko Shimizu: You
know so I did know,

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:30.410
except for Monkey Paw I didn't
know, but I knew all the stories.

00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:34.400
It's interesting, you know, my
friends and people I know read it

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:37.990
and there are always different
stories they don't know

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:40.980
like I didn't know this,
I didn't know that.

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:43.960
And there are not many people
who knew every one of them

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:49.340
but fairy tales are
interesting because Disney has

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:53.840
like since very sort of
like sanitized everything,

00:21:53.840 --> 00:22:02.110
but it's really dark and, you
know, tragic often and not many

00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:04.720
of them have happy endings.

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:10.920
So in that sense Michael's book is
more true to the actual fairy tales

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:14.650
than Disney's stories are.

00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:17.540
It's like fascinating I ask people

00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:23.860
like do you know how Little
Mermaids end at the end and most

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:25.300
of the people don't know.

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:26.600
Most of the kids don't know.

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:29.220
I teach college art school and many

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:33.660
of the college students don't
know and that worries me.

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:41.650
Like it's almost like bringing back
what is real in a 21st century way.

00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:42.950
&gt;&gt; Michael Cunningham:
Would you remind us

00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:44.410
of how the Little Mermaid
actually ends.

00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:45.710
[laughter]

00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:47.010
&gt;&gt; Yuko Shimizu: You
remember, right?

00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:48.310
&gt;&gt; Michael Cunningham: I do.

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:49.610
I do.

00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:50.910
&gt;&gt; Yuko Shimizu: Yes.

00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:52.540
You so like she kills
herself, right?

00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:58.980
Like because he, the
prince, picks the other woman

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:02.140 position:56%
who he thought saved him who didn't.

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:05.680
The little mermaid saved
but she couldn't say it

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:10.820
and then he picked her
and they get married

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:17.020
and then the contract was she
can get him and she will either

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:20.000
like turn like yeah she
has to kill herself.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.480
So she kills herself but she
turns into like a water bubble

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:25.670
and travels around the world.

00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:28.250
I think that's the ending, right?

00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:29.550
&gt;&gt; Michael Cunningham:
Yeah, that's the ending.

00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:30.850
&gt;&gt; Yuko Shimizu: Yes.

00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:32.150
&gt;&gt; Michael Cunningham: Okay.

00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:35.470
Just quickly Sleeping
Beauty, the prince gets

00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:39.490
into the tower and kisses her.

00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:40.830
No effect.

00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:44.280
He goes off, he does other things,

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:48.730
he thinks you know I've just been
thinking about that comatose girl

00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:51.260 position:56%
so he goes back and kisses her again

00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:53.840
and this time she wakes
up but she's pregnant.

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:57.790
This is the true original
Sleeping Beauty

00:23:57.790 --> 00:24:00.120
because what he we
know what he did to her

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:02.850
that first time while
she was comatose.

00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:04.290
[laughter] It wasn't just a kiss.

00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:08.720
This is the Sleepy Beauty
as originally conceived.

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.880
I did not darken these fairy tales.

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:12.680
I did not make them more perverse.

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:16.880
&gt;&gt; Yuko Shimizu: No, and then Snow
White kills the evil stepmother

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:18.180
at the end.

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:19.480
&gt;&gt; Michael Cunningham: Yeah, yeah.

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:21.760
That one I've always liked
that one in particular.

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:23.060
&gt;&gt; Yuko Shimizu: Do you know this?

00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:25.480
If you don't please read them.

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:27.430
We're not making this up.

00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:28.730
[laughter]

00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:30.030
&gt;&gt; Michael Cunningham: I think Snow
White is an especially interesting

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:32.720
one because, you know, yeah,
she kills the stepmother.

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:36.520
By the way, the prince is
just riding through the forest

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:41.060
and he sees a dead girl in a
glass coffin and kisses her.

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:42.860
What's that about?

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:46.090
[ Laughter ]

00:24:46.090 --> 00:24:48.270
&gt;&gt; Yuko Shimizu: There must be
something wrong with him, right?

00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:51.260
&gt;&gt; Michael Cunningham: Well,
you know a kiss you know

00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:54.570
if a beautiful corpse is still a
corpse and it's a stranger and it's

00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:59.280
in the woods, and there's seven
little people huddled around it,

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:01.580
I might not kiss that girl.

00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:04.390
[laughter] Or I might,
but you know, it's just

00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:05.690
&gt;&gt; Yuko Shimizu: I won't.

00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:07.610
&gt;&gt; Michael Cunningham:
It's there are you're I'm

00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:11.310
so glad you're pointing
this out because they're so,

00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:17.440
they're so fabulously
peculiar and perverse and dark

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:22.070
and the ones the Disney
versions that certainly I grew

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:24.450
up with this is a whole
other conversation.

00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:26.210
But I don't hate the
Disney versions.

00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:32.210
I have complicated feelings
about being so terrified

00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:34.040
about the Arthur Rackham
illustrations

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:36.590
in the childhood book I grew
up with that I couldn't,

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:39.460
I couldn't go into the
room where it was kept.

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:42.160
[laughter] Like I wanted
to hear the stories.

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:44.210
&gt;&gt; Yuko Shimizu: He was my
favorite artist growing up.

00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:47.290
&gt;&gt; Michael Cunningham: But
they just so freaked me out.

00:25:47.290 --> 00:25:51.770
And like I said, I think the whole
the sanitized Disney versions are

00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:55.870
not a good thing, they're
a complicated thing.

00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:57.170
&gt;&gt; David Rowell: But
speaking of the complications,

00:25:57.170 --> 00:26:01.260
Michael is the only writer who
would take the sort of Snow White

00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:05.340 position:56%
and the Seven Dwarfs and think about
later, okay so they're together

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:07.280
but at some point she feels
obligated to have the dwarfs

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:11.770
over for a dinner party
and they kind of resent him

00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:14.470
and so later they're talking
about the dinner party

00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:17.500
like oh yeah, that went well.

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.990
[laughter] So, you know,
I mean one of the things

00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:21.290
that Michael is constantly doing

00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:24.180
in these stories is he is
you know these stories seem

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:26.150
to be very ridged in their ending.

00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:31.650
They're very final in one sense
that good has triumphed over evil

00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:32.980
and what else is there to know.

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:38.030
But Michael, you know, in these
stories comes in and says but what

00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:40.780
about the next day, and
maybe six years from now.

00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:43.430
How are things going in the castle?

00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:47.830
And you know I mean that ambiguity
is I mean what all writers want

00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:50.990
ambiguity, of course, but
it also keeps these stories

00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:53.100
from being predictable
because there's

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:55.500
so many surprises in each of them.

00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:56.800
&gt;&gt; Michael Cunningham:
Yeah, yeah, I hope so.

00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:59.100
You know that actually
stems from my childhood

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:04.340
when we would my mother mostly
would read these fairy tales to me

00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:07.260
and she would get to and
they lived happily ever after

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:11.030
and it took me a long
time to get over this.

00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:14.370
I would look at her like go on.

00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:16.510
And she would say, no that's
the end and I would say,

00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:18.430
no that can't be the end.

00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:22.780
What happens what happens to the
prince with the one swan wing?

00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:24.400
What if Snow White
doesn't like the castle?

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:25.700
What if, what if, what if?

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:27.340
And she would just kind
of light a cigarette

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:29.510
and say, well that's the end.

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:32.100
[ Laughter ]

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:33.400
Go to bed.

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:36.880
So I had to do, I had
to do the work myself.

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:38.760
&gt;&gt; David Rowell: So this is
a question for both of you

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:40.250
and I'll start with you, Michael.

00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:46.160
If you had tried this project
10 years ago or 20 years ago,

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:50.110 position:56%
do you imagine that these you would
have brought different inclinations,

00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:51.790
insights [inaudible]
to these stories?

00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:54.740
Would they have been very
different do you think?

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:56.040
&gt;&gt; Michael Cunningham: Wow.

00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:58.800
You know I, I, I imagine
they would have been.

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:00.100
I mean I hope so.

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:06.060
You hope you're not the same writer
10 years or 20 years down the line.

00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:11.390
I was just talking to
somebody about this yesterday.

00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:16.770
This is I think they would have
I suspect they would have been

00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:21.470
different in at least one way
that comes immediately to mind.

00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:34.200
Twenty years ago when I was 50 I no
when I was younger, say in my 20s,

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:45.950
I was, I was so dead
set against anything

00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:48.770
that suggested sentimentality.

00:28:48.770 --> 00:28:54.970
As young people often are,
as my students often are.

00:28:54.970 --> 00:29:03.820
Some of my most brilliant students
are just so terrified of sentiment

00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:07.430
that what they produce is
barren and like, you know,

00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:13.480
like an ice cube, and
we talk about that.

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:21.460
And I certainly now that I am know
longer in my 20s, I no longer feel

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:29.610
like oh, anything that isn't barren
and hopeless and wind blasted

00:29:29.610 --> 00:29:32.710
and without any nourishment
or kindness

00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:35.120
to speak of is no use to me.

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:36.420
&gt;&gt; David Rowell: Ha ha.

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:38.490
&gt;&gt; Michael Cunningham: I'm not
that guy anymore, you know.

00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:39.790
&gt;&gt; David Rowell: Sure.

00:29:39.790 --> 00:29:42.960
&gt;&gt; Michael Cunningham: I hope,
I hope I haven't gotten mushy,

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:53.060
but I certainly at this age am not
as opposed to rampant expressions

00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:57.850
of love and sorrow as I would
have been when I was younger.

00:29:57.850 --> 00:29:59.320
&gt;&gt; David Rowell: Yuko,
how about you?

00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:02.830
If this had been a project
much earlier in your career.

00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:07.180
&gt;&gt; Yuko Shimizu: I bet it would
be different and I teach college,

00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:11.060
college level art students
and illustrations classes

00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:16.350
and I also went to the same
school as a student and going

00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:18.960
through four years as a
student then started teaching

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:23.150
and I've been teaching there
for I think 12 or 13 years,

00:30:23.150 --> 00:30:29.200
fairy tales often come up
as a subject for assignments

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:31.710
because everyone knows fairy tales.

00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:34.540
Everyone has relationship
with fairy tales.

00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:38.900
It's kind of an easy topic
to give as to students

00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:43.940
but at the same time it's one
of the hardest because like ever

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:48.650
since we were little child like
we're bombarded with imagery

00:30:48.650 --> 00:30:53.210
like Disney or not, you
know, like dark or happy.

00:30:53.210 --> 00:30:58.400
Image of children's books from,
you know, like Grimm and Andersen

00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:04.300
and all those famous stories and
we have certain ideas in our head.

00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:08.220
It's really really
difficult to get away from it.

00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:13.630
So if I don't give my students
intentionally fairy tale assignment

00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:18.690
because it's they will come
out with something like yeah,

00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:20.300
I've already seen that before

00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:23.640
and like why are you
drawing Snow White this way?

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:27.060
That's how you remember
from Disney movies.

00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:30.000
So there are all these
things that is

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.490
like keeping you from
freeing yourself.

00:31:32.490 --> 00:31:36.040 position:56%
So like going back to your question,

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:39.820
I hope I'm a better
artist than when I started.

00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:43.560
I've been doing this for
about 15 years or so,

00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:48.610
and so if I got this
assignment 15 years ago,

00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:56.660
I would have tried my best but like
how much how good would I have been

00:31:56.660 --> 00:32:02.360
to get away from these
images that traps us?

00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:06.740
And the better you get, the
more sophisticated you get

00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:11.510
as a visual artist or writer
or any kind of art form,

00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:17.190
you know like is getting away from
and it makes it easier for you

00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:22.160
to come out with something that is
fresh, and it's really hard to do

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:24.110
at early stage in your career.

00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:25.410
&gt;&gt; David Rowell: Uh huh.

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:31.290
&gt;&gt; Yuko Shimizu: So I'm glad
that I got it maybe like 12 years

00:32:31.290 --> 00:32:35.230
into my career and how I
remember this is the first time

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:39.520
so the art director Rodrigo
who designed this cover too

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:44.500
and he called me and he said like,
you know, Michael is interested

00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:48.550
in your work so like are you
interested in working with this.

00:32:48.550 --> 00:32:52.830
Like I'm calling you
because you're not like one

00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:58.730
of those young young talented
artists who can't handle this yet.

00:32:58.730 --> 00:33:01.310
I think you have enough
experience to handle

00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:05.980
like I clearly remember had I
said like you're not just a kid,

00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:07.640
I think you can handle this.

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:10.200
So that's my answer.

00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:11.920
&gt;&gt; Michael Cunningham:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:13.220
&gt;&gt; David Rowell: Well,
I have the feeling

00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:15.560
that this is probably a group that
would like to ask some questions,

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:18.630
so in the time we have left,
we have about 10 minutes,

00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:19.930
there are two microphones

00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:24.510
that if there are questions we
could certainly we have time, sure.

00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:37.740
[ Background Sounds ]

00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:41.890
&gt;&gt; I'm just curious about
cultural differences.

00:33:41.890 --> 00:33:45.630
About 25 years ago I worked in
advertising in Tokyo and one

00:33:45.630 --> 00:33:50.930
of my clients, I was a
copywriter, was Shiseido.

00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:54.870
And so my boss a Japanese woman
came to me I said I want you

00:33:54.870 --> 00:34:00.230 position:56%
to promote this skin cream because
it brings harmony to a woman's life.

00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:05.130
And I'm going because I was
selling to western women and I had

00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:08.430
to convince her that's
not going to work.

00:34:08.430 --> 00:34:12.200
[laughter] So I'm wondering if
you had any cultural differences

00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:15.630
in working as a writer
and illustrator.

00:34:15.630 --> 00:34:19.910
&gt;&gt; Yuko Shimizu: The cultural
difference that me coming

00:34:19.910 --> 00:34:22.870
from different background
or cultural difference

00:34:22.870 --> 00:34:25.240
between artist and writer?

00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:27.080
&gt;&gt; You being Japanese.

00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:28.430
&gt;&gt; Oh, I being Japanese.

00:34:28.430 --> 00:34:34.940
I actually grew up here as a kid so
like I'm a Japanese citizen still

00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:39.510
and I still have lived in Japan
longer than I have lived here,

00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:42.690
but I went middle stool in U.S.,

00:34:42.690 --> 00:34:46.980
and so that's when you know a
kid develop their personal ID

00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:49.780 position:56%
and you know like sense of identity.

00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:54.580
So since then I went
back to Japan when I was

00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:57.350
in high school and
then came back here.

00:34:57.350 --> 00:35:00.590
I always feel like I'm
neither, so I'm half and half

00:35:00.590 --> 00:35:05.290
or like you know both and
I miss I lack little bit

00:35:05.290 --> 00:35:07.930
of like American common sense.

00:35:07.930 --> 00:35:11.370
I lack a little bit of
Japanese common sense

00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:13.480
but I'm also well rounded in both.

00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:20.550
You know like you can't be double,
you can't have like perfect both,

00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:31.570
so I think I'm pretty good and of
course as an artist who is working

00:35:31.570 --> 00:35:37.180
with my name attached like I have
to like what I have to do is I have

00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:41.100
to do something that is fresh.

00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:42.400
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:46.510
&gt;&gt; Yuko Shimizu: And if my being
hybrid makes it fresh like and if

00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:49.170
that works, that's enough for me.

00:35:49.170 --> 00:35:53.160
&gt;&gt; Michael did you
feel any difference or

00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:55.050
&gt;&gt; Michael Cunningham:
Not working with Yuko

00:35:55.050 --> 00:36:02.170
but when I was writing the stories
I read more nonwestern fairy tales

00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:06.700
than I had before and
Asian fairy tales,

00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:10.730
African fairy tales
are really different.

00:36:10.730 --> 00:36:12.030
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:14.280
&gt;&gt; Michael Cunningham:
Profoundly different in their sense

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:16.620
of the stories a child
should be told.

00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:19.620
A lot of them are much more of
them are neolistic [phonetic],

00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:26.680 position:56%
western fairy tales one must much
more to moral improvement than a lot

00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:29.210
of Asian and African fairy tales.

00:36:29.210 --> 00:36:32.990
But finally, it was a bit of a
no brainer because I just felt

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:39.870 position:56%
like in another kind of book, you
want to try to transcend to the best

00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:49.050 position:56%
of your ability your localness, your
Americanness, your tiny little head

00:36:49.050 --> 00:36:51.780
in your tiny little life.

00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:57.000
But I could not it would
have felt so fraudulent.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.300
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:01.010
&gt;&gt; Michael Cunningham: To
try to reimagine stories

00:37:01.010 --> 00:37:05.760
that were not the stories
I was told as a child.

00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:07.290
That would have felt
like some kind of creepy

00:37:07.290 --> 00:37:09.350
&gt;&gt; Yeah. You're talking
about being American,

00:37:09.350 --> 00:37:13.820
one of the things I'll never forget
was my boss was, he wasn't my boss

00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:16.560
but I worked with him, a creative
director, he was Japanese,

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:19.410
he didn't even speak English,
he had never been to the U.S.

00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:22.310
But I taught him a little bit of
English and he would introduce me

00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:26.080
and say, this is Nan
san, my name is Nan,

00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:28.510
she's from New York but she's nice.

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:32.340
&gt;&gt; Michael Cunningham: Thank you.

00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:33.640
&gt;&gt; David Rowell: Yes.

00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:38.330
&gt;&gt; I was wondering have you ever
thought of trying a different style

00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:40.070
when it comes to drawing?

00:37:40.070 --> 00:37:43.010
Maybe something more
like art nouveau.

00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:44.310
&gt;&gt; Yuko Shimizu: For this?

00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:48.880
&gt;&gt; No, for anything.

00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:51.800
&gt;&gt; Yuko Shimizu: If the
right project comes up.

00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:56.870
So like the job of an illustrator
is like you know try to do my thing

00:37:56.870 --> 00:38:02.270
and at the same time like
pick some concept that works

00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:05.150
with the problem I need to solve.

00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:10.420
For this problem like how I needed
to solve was a turn of the 19th

00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:13.730
to 20th century European
children's book style.

00:38:13.730 --> 00:38:17.530
So if any project comes up
that calls for art nouveau,

00:38:17.530 --> 00:38:21.110
I would do it, but at this
point I haven't seen it yet,

00:38:21.110 --> 00:38:23.440
so that's why I haven't done it.

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:25.640
&gt;&gt; Okay, thank you.

00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:26.940

00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:29.440

sentimentality earlier

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:30.740
and about avoiding it.

00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:33.120
I was just wondering this is
a question for both of you

00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:36.250
if you're concerned, if
something whether it's art

00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:40.850
or literature is too sentimental
then it lapses into kitsch

00:38:40.850 --> 00:38:44.910
or it lapses into the territory
of being sappy or trite.

00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:48.060
Is that something that
both of you try to avoid

00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:50.510
and how do you avoid that?

&gt;&gt; Michael Cunningham: I'll go.

00:38:54.930 --> 00:39:04.390 position:56%
I'm really talking about veering
closer to the edge of sentimentality

00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:09.780
which is as opposed to
saying 10 miles away from it

00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:13.960
so that there's no danger that
you'll ever be maudlin or mawkish.

00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:19.480 position:56%
As I grow older I'm more interested
not only as a writer but as a reader

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:27.870
in work that sort of acknowledges
our emotionality and is willing

00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:29.830
to risk going a little too far.

00:39:29.830 --> 00:39:34.070
And the trick is trying never
to go too far and I'm fortunate

00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:39.090
in having a small body of
terrifically cruel friends

00:39:39.090 --> 00:39:46.100
who are readers who are merciless
and I really I have to say

00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:48.890
that without Ken Corbet
[phonetic] and Marie How [phonetic]

00:39:48.890 --> 00:39:52.150
and Adam Moss [phonetic]
and several other people,

00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:56.790
I can't imagine how I would do
this because one of their jobs is

00:39:56.790 --> 00:40:00.020
to say, honey that's too much.

00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:05.270
[laughter] And I have the
good sense to listen to them.

00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:08.480
&gt;&gt; Yuko Shimizu: So from
the artist's point of view,

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:11.390
I think it's like sentiment
is like well

00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:14.780 position:56%
like there are different definitions
so like looking back at something

00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:19.060
and like oh that was nice and
try to like re create that.

00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:25.090
And what I always keep in mind
is like regardless of what I feel

00:40:25.090 --> 00:40:30.430 position:56%
about that nostalgia or time period
I'm looking back to like we live now

00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:35.080
and how to bring the
contemporary feel to something old.

00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:38.630
If I'm like imitating something
old in this case, you know,

00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:42.500
the old children's book or like
maybe art nouveau at some point,

00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:48.760
if I just redraw what was then
there then it becomes kitsch

00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:55.910
or it becomes just copy, so
I try to like put my mindset,

00:40:55.910 --> 00:41:02.280
yes I'm doing this, I'm duplicating
the style but also I live now

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:04.950
and how to make it
look contemporary.

00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:07.530
And there is no like
one way of doing that

00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:12.370
but the mindset really
helps I think.

00:41:12.370 --> 00:41:13.670

more question, sure.

&gt;&gt; Michael, I have a question.

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:25.100
Earlier in your career you focused
on gay relationships in novels

00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:28.030
and I'm a person who is writing

00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:32.240
about controversial subjects
the way women are treated

00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:33.900
in the hard sciences.

00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:37.050
And I've received so much criticism
and I wonder if you could talk

00:41:37.050 --> 00:41:39.230
to criticism you might
have gotten back

00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:43.030
in the 90s I guess
in your first books.

00:41:44.330 --> 00:41:48.970
Could everybody hear that?

00:41:48.970 --> 00:41:52.330
You know I, I've, I think
I've always written novels

00:41:52.330 --> 00:41:57.980
in which there are gay characters,
more gay characters than are

00:41:57.980 --> 00:42:01.980
in most books, but also straight
character, more straight characters

00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:04.510
than there are in most books
with gay people in them.

00:42:04.510 --> 00:42:11.810
[ Laughter ]

00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:13.980
I think our situations
are different.

00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:16.100
I think the world's
perception, I think,

00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:21.240
I think the world tortures
women in ways slightly different

00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:24.480
from the way it which
it tortures gay men.

I on one hand this stuff was
just sort of ignored, you know,

00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:40.240
it was niche writing, it was,
it was the genre known as gay.

&gt;&gt; Michael Cunningham: Yeah, yeah.

00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:45.330
&gt;&gt; David Rowell: In
bookstores there's sort

00:42:45.330 --> 00:42:46.630
of that one section
of gay literature.

00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:52.310
&gt;&gt; Michael Cunningham: But I
have to say, a lot of people,

00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:55.210
many of them gay, many

00:42:55.210 --> 00:42:58.780
of them people whose sexual
orientation was whatever it was

00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:00.430
but who were especially interested

00:43:00.430 --> 00:43:04.480
in gay [inaudible] paid
particular attention.

00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:13.370
It was, it wasn't planned, but it
was actually kind of helpful to be

00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:18.760
out there writing about lives
that hadn't appeared much

00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:24.280
if at all in fiction before.

00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:34.800 position:56%
And I'm, I'm still slightly
surprised even after all these years

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:38.290
that I got first I kind
of got out of the niche,

00:43:38.290 --> 00:43:41.790
and then they just closed
the niche altogether.

00:43:41.790 --> 00:43:44.690
There aren't gay sections
in bookstores anymore

00:43:44.690 --> 00:43:47.350
and I for one don't
miss them, you know.

00:43:47.350 --> 00:43:48.650
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:43:48.650 --> 00:43:50.570
&gt;&gt; Michael Cunningham: Put the
books in with everybody else.

00:43:50.570 --> 00:43:52.370
&gt;&gt; David Rowell: Right.

00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:55.040
[ Applause ]

00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:57.100
&gt;&gt; Do you have any advice for women

00:43:57.100 --> 00:43:59.470
like myself writing
on these subjects?

00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:01.440
&gt;&gt; Michael Cunningham:
Off the top of my head,

00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:03.670
fuck anybody who gets in your way.

00:44:03.670 --> 00:44:04.970
[laughter]

00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:06.270
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:44:06.270 --> 00:44:07.600
&gt;&gt; David Rowell: That's a
pretty good note to end on.

00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:11.620
Let's have a round of
applause for Michael

00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:13.510
and Yuko for joining us today.

00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:19.800
[ Applause ]

00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:23.460
Thanks everyone.

00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:25.810
Thanks very much.
