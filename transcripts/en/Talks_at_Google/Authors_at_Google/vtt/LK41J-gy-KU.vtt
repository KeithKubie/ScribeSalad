[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.256 --> 00:00:09.380
LAURA SLABIN: Hi, everyone.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.180
I'm Laura Slabin, and
I'm very excited to have

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.290
with us today Gillian
Anderson and Jennifer Nadel,

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:18.910
who wrote the book, "We--

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.710
a Manifesto for
Women Everywhere."

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.730
I will start with their bios
and a little bit about the book,

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.820
and then we'll go
into some questions.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.000
So Gillian Anderson is an
award-winning film, television

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.430
and theater actor and
producer, writer, and activist.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.840
She currently lives in London
with her daughter and two sons.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.170
And Jennifer Nadel is an
award-winning broadcast

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.710
journalist, qualified
attorney, writer, and activist.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.850
American-born, she lives in
London with her three sons.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.210
So "We," the way
they've described it,

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.730
"is a movement for
change, a manifesto

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.720
for female-led revolution,
a quiet, peaceful about face

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.410
that doesn't require the
consent of those in power.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.800
It just asks each one of
us, one woman at a time,

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.730
to be the change and take
the journey from me to we."

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.410
And when I read that, when
I was reading the book,

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.440
I thought it was
extremely timely

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.050
given what is going
on in the world

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.390
today with different
leadership here in America,

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.180
with Brexit in London.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.320
So I want to thank you
both for being here.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.690
I know it's been a very hectic
week with your schedules.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.150
Before I delve into
the book, I wanted

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.370
to discuss two
ideas that I think

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.600
that this Google audience would
find of particular interest.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.260
And that women in tech
as well as pay equality.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.100
So how many people
here in the room

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.000
were fans of Scully
and "The X-Files"?

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.570
I have to raise my hand as well.

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.920
And how many of you are
familiar with the Scully Effect?

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.420
A few?

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.330
Just a few.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.590
So for those that have not
heard of the Scully Effect,

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.260
it's believed that
Gillian's character, Scully,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.009
who was a medical doctor,
an FBI specialist,

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.040
inspired many young women to
pursue careers in science,

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.520
medicine, and law enforcement,
bringing an actual perceptible

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.520
increase in the number
of women in those fields.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.980
So that's pretty
interesting, and I

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.230
know we talk a lot
here at Google of how

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.780
do we get more women in tech?

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.270
Who are the role
models, et cetera?

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.810
And how do we get more
diversity and inclusively?

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.960
So I think Hollywood, as well,
seems to be having a shakeup

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:35.890
right now.

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.010
And I'm wondering what are some
of the factors that are helping

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.990
to bring about that
change and what

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:46.030
do you think can be done
to further stimulate change

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.177
in Hollywood or
in women in tech?

00:02:49.177 --> 00:02:51.010
GILLIAN ANDERSON: Well,
it seems like things

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.140
are being stimulated
in Hollywood, you know,

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.060
when someone like
Patricia Arquette

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.290
makes a statement at the
Oscars and Meryl Streep

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.430
has been very, very vocal about
pay equality in that industry.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.200
And overall, having women
very publicly speak out

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.120
about the fact of it, and you
all may know of the letter

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:19.150
that Jennifer Lawrence wrote,
which was beautifully worded--

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.920
those things, I think,
on the one hand,

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.280
it keeps the conversation
alive, and also it

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.930
emboldens women to
have that conversation.

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.150
It empowers them to be able
to have that conversation

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.380
for themselves.

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.420
It's a complicated
issue, you know.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.670
And I don't know what
the percentage is

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.340
of female employees at Google.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:51.310
But I know in my
industry, it feels

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.910
like something one actually has
very, very little control over.

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.780
Because at the end
of the day, it's

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.270
up to the writers, the casting
directors, the producers.

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:10.510
And as we all know, so often
the roles of females to men

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.640
not only are minimal, but they
end up being women in their 20s

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.190
when their love interests
or their husbands

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.100
are in their 50s, et
cetera, et cetera.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:28.360
But it is an ongoing
and increasingly talked

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.970
about conversation
that I think that there

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.489
are some changes in the
process that are being made.

00:04:35.489 --> 00:04:37.030
JENNIFER NADEL: And
I think all of us

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.000
can have an influence as well,
because ultimately Hollywood

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.840
is giving us what
Hollywood thinks we want.

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.640
So if we start
changing what we want,

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.960
which is part of what this book
is about-- this book is about

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.400
really getting to recognize
what is intrinsic to us, what

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.210
our authentic wants
and tastes are,

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.870
and those that have been imposed
and that we've just absorbed

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.450
without even realizing
that we have internalized,

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.150
you know, the male gaze.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.630
We have internalized a
very typically male way

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.280
of looking at women.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:15.200
And as we start to shed that,
Hollywood needs to make money

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.320
and wants to make
money, so it's up to us

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.100
where we decide to put
our bottoms on seats.

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.356
LAURA SLABIN: Makes sense.

00:05:22.356 --> 00:05:23.730
So I want to delve
into the book.

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:26.600
And it's a very
personal, and I would

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.830
say, deeply personal book.

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.040
And I'm going to share
a quote with everyone.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.950
It says, "Let us out of darkness
from a place where both of us

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.400
were suicidal and in despair
and into a way of life that

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.030
has meaning and purpose."

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.020
So sharing that,
I'm just curious

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.670
why you decided
to write the book

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:47.600
and share such personal
stories throughout.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.980
And I'm curious also if you
were reticent about sharing

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:52.999
those vulnerabilities.

00:05:52.999 --> 00:05:54.290
JENNIFER NADEL: Good questions.

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:56.990
I mean, we're quite
extreme cases.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.710
We like to take
things to extremes.

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:01.640
And you know, I
think both of us have

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.620
been seekers since our teens.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.990
We've been up against the
edge of things since then.

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.880
And so as a result, we
have really been obliged.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.690
The reason we're still here
and able to sit in front of you

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:19.020
reasonably, sometimes
articulately-- not always--

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.650
is because of the stuff that
we have distilled down and put

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:22.370
in this book.

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:26.360
That's why we're alive today,
because we were obliged

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.460
to really, really seek answers.

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.300
And the reason we wanted
to put those answers down

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.340
was, I think, that
it's a gift in a way,

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.740
if you've had no option
but to look for answers.

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:41.510
But many people live with
a level of misery and pain,

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:43.420
many women, in particular.

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:46.060
It just isn't
necessary to live with.

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:50.050
And if we look at
rates of self-harm--

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:52.340
Gillian's got a
good figure on that.

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:58.280
And addiction and eating
disorders and depression

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:02.450
amongst women in particular,
you know, we have an epidemic.

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:06.590
So something is not working,
despite this amazing society

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:07.970
that we've created
for ourselves.

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:10.235
Something is going badly wrong.

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:15.170
So that was one of the things
that we wanted to address.

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:16.670
GILLIAN ANDERSON:
And also, the book

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:20.060
is based on nine principles,
which are essentially

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:25.580
tools or universal values
like honesty and humility

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:29.780
and courage and trust.

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:32.630
But one of the
foundation principles,

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:34.567
actually, the first
one is honesty,

00:07:34.567 --> 00:07:36.650
which goes throughout all
of the other principles.

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:39.260
Because unless we
can really, really

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:44.180
get honest about what's going
on for us, where our sorrow is,

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:47.430
what the truth of our lives
and what works for us is,

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:49.970
then it's very difficult
to then step out

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.520
of that and into
another solution.

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:58.820
And so in asking readers to be
that honest in their process,

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:01.510
it became very
important that we too

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:04.850
were willing to get honest
about some of the stuff that's

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:05.690
gone on for us.

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:08.360
And it's been interesting
the last week,

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:13.194
because I speak in the
book about a couple things

00:08:13.194 --> 00:08:14.360
that I've gone honest about.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.820
One is periods of
time where I've

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:20.810
suffered from
massive panic attacks

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:24.080
and also with my
struggles with parenting

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.810
and how hard I sometimes
find parenting.

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:31.340
And in this last week,
a lot of the headlines

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:37.250
has been, celebrities
with mental health issues.

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:40.070
Part of what we're trying
to do with this book

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:44.480
is to talk about them and
the solution, the solution

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:48.470
to those things
that bring up panic

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:51.020
and anxiety and
uncertainty and fear

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:55.070
and the desire to eat
six tubs of Haagen-Dazs

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:59.420
or spends 15 hours of
gaming every afternoon

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:02.960
or whatever it is
that is our escape.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.090
Part of what we talk
about in the book

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:08.330
are ways that we can start to
wean ourselves off those things

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:11.580
and do things that bring much
more meaning in our lives.

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:16.310
And so it's interesting how
in being honest about some

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:18.380
of the things that I
have gone through it

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:20.300
then becomes a negative.

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:22.040
There's the negative
twist on it,

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:25.280
which is part of what--
we're used to being bombarded

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.250
by so much negativity
when actually it's

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:31.042
a means to an end, ultimately,
if you look at it that way.

00:09:31.042 --> 00:09:32.750
LAURA SLABIN: Will
you share a little bit

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:36.020
about how you came up
with the nine principles?

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:38.805
I'm sure at some point there
were maybe more than nine.

00:09:38.805 --> 00:09:39.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:40.950
Then how you wittled them down?

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:42.140
JENNIFER NADEL: That's
such a good question.

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:43.340
That's such a good question.

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:45.650
What we found, we
kind of put everything

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:47.380
that we wanted to say--

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:50.080
the book really takes
the reader on a journey.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.370
And it starts off,
as Gillian said,

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:55.390
with honesty and with our
relationship with ourselves.

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:57.860
And then it finishes
with kindness,

00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:00.920
which is about how we engage
with the world at large

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:04.400
and how we go about helping
to be a part of bringing

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.680
the changes that need to be
brought so that our society is

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:11.170
more compassionate and
fairer and more equal.

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:14.340
So we put everything
down, and we just thought,

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:16.800
what are the essentials in here?

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.080
And often they
were similar words.

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:23.130
We had a long debate about
kindness or compassion.

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:25.620
What should the
ninth principle be?

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:30.360
So sometimes it was
kind of something

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:31.750
that was close, but not quite.

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:33.120
So we had to pick and choose.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.880
But in terms of the nine, they
kind of revealed themselves,

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:36.630
I think.

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:38.963
GILLIAN ANDERSON: Also one
of the things we wanted to do

00:10:38.963 --> 00:10:46.399
was to use the positive
side of the principle

00:10:46.399 --> 00:10:47.440
that we're talking about.

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:50.040
So courage, for
instance, is actually

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:53.250
really about anger and
resentment and the things

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:58.080
that we're holding onto that we
can't quite seem to let go of,

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.930
and really digging
honestly into those things,

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:03.630
and being courageous
enough to look

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:07.560
at the things which actually eat
away at us on a daily basis--

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:11.640
those little hurts that
maybe we haven't let go of,

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:14.130
or the person that we haven't
talked to in a few years,

00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:18.330
those areas where we end up
getting very tightly closed

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:22.660
and not wanting to deal with,
having the courage, to then,

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:26.340
to face them, and to
get honest with what

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:28.710
our own part in that dynamic is.

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:32.820
And so courage is actually
a lot about resentment,

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:37.920
and it's the principles are
the positive side of maybe

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:40.150
trickier things to deal with.

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:42.900
LAURA SLABIN: And one of the
things that you recommended

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:46.080
in your book, in addition to
following the nine principles,

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.210
was meditation.

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:50.220
And I personally
continue to hear

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:51.930
how wonderful meditation is.

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:54.420
I have attempted many times.

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:56.730
I have apps on my
phone that are supposed

00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:57.870
to help with meditation.

00:11:57.870 --> 00:12:02.100
I do yoga, and I still
have not personally

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:03.210
gotten something to stick.

00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:04.830
And if you'll just
share a little bit

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:06.810
about what your
personal meditation

00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:14.700
practices are and any advice for
us on how can we find our own?

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:18.930
I think that those of us at
Google, we're traveling a lot.

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:19.920
We're busy.

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:21.420
There's a lot going
on in our minds.

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:24.226
So I think finding that
practice would be very helpful.

00:12:24.226 --> 00:12:26.850
JENNIFER NADEL: I think it's so
important because so many of us

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:28.560
are so identified
with our thoughts

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.950
that we don't realize that
that's not who we are.

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:33.540
Our thoughts are
just our thoughts,

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:37.590
and our true self
resides in a silent place

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:38.590
underneath our thoughts.

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:41.730
But I found
meditation impossible

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:43.710
for a long period
of time, because I

00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:46.401
would go-- even that little bit
at the end of the yoga class,

00:12:46.401 --> 00:12:48.900
where you're just meant to lie
still, that would be torture.

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:51.090
Because I would feel
like I was lying

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:53.610
with a swarm of angry wasps
that were just going to come

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:55.980
and sting me if I lay still,
which was my thinking,

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:59.280
you know, those attack
thoughts that we all have.

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:03.210
And then a friend suggested
just try two minutes.

00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:05.400
And I was like, what's
the point of two minutes?

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:06.480
I'm an extreme person.

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:10.190
I like extreme, big answers.

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:10.920
And it worked.

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:12.970
Because anyone can
find two minutes.

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:14.430
And you can set
it on your phone,

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:16.930
and it doesn't matter
how much pain it has.

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:20.340
But what that two minutes
did was it started a habit.

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:23.550
A meditation is a habit.

00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:25.650
And once you start--

00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:28.837
really small, don't stretch
beyond where you can.

00:13:28.837 --> 00:13:30.420
And we describe in
the book-- we start

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:32.220
with suggesting that practice.

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:35.970
But a lot of the time, we have
to kind of scrape away and heal

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:36.840
a lot of our wounds.

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:39.720
Because otherwise, it is
torture to sit with ourselves.

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:42.030
So it's further on
in the book that we

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:44.160
talk about how to
deepen that practice

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.986
and stretch it out to--

00:13:46.986 --> 00:13:49.379
you know, I try and
do 20 every day.

00:13:49.379 --> 00:13:50.670
GILLIAN ANDERSON: Yeah, me too.

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:58.950
But I started meditating when I
was in high school, initially,

00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:01.440
but also extended it
into periods of time

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:03.900
when I was drunk.

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:06.540
Now it's a very different
practice that I have.

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:09.990
But one of the things that
used to drive me insane

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:12.576
was if I didn't have the
candle, if I wasn't facing

00:14:12.576 --> 00:14:15.200
the right way, if I didn't have
the right cushion, if I didn't,

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:17.800
then it didn't feel like
it was perfect in some way,

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.700
or that the experience
of the meditation

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:24.100
was as deep as it
could have been.

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:27.390
And then I was away
filming something,

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:32.100
and the only viable
place to meditate

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:35.280
was on the kitchen floor
next to the refrigerator.

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:39.600
And I had one of the most
extraordinary meditation

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:45.690
experiences of my life,
and it was purely a gift

00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:48.915
to show me that I could
kind of do it anywhere.

00:14:48.915 --> 00:14:49.790
I can do it anywhere.

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:50.700
I can do it on set.

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:52.020
I can do it in hotel rooms.

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:52.530
I can do it.

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:59.030
I don't need to have all those
perfect environmental things

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:01.975
to have it work for me.

00:15:01.975 --> 00:15:03.600
JENNIFER NADEL: And
also, you know, you

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.190
talked about having
it on your phone.

00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:07.559
It's kind of been
co-opted meditation,

00:15:07.559 --> 00:15:09.600
and it's become another
thing that we have to do.

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:12.510
Have I done my meditation yet?

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:13.650
Have I done my exercise?

00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:15.990
And actually, it's
not about doing.

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:18.150
It's about being.

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:21.630
And if one's doing it
to get an end result,

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:25.750
then you're kind of
shortchanging yourself.

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:27.330
And if you can just trust--

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:31.380
so often we need to know
what's going to happen.

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:33.960
But if you can just
trust that process,

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:37.500
and trust that those
millions of people who've

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:42.720
done it through the
centuries know something,

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.170
then it will start to work.

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:45.750
LAURA SLABIN: I'll
find two minutes

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:48.612
before going to
bed this evening.

00:15:48.612 --> 00:15:50.820
I mentioned that I thought
it was an interesting time

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:52.530
in the history right now.

00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:56.070
And women, I think,
are mobilizing

00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:59.760
more and more with marches,
with strikes, et cetera.

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:01.980
And from reading the book
and a little bit more

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:04.320
about both of your
backgrounds, it's clear

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:08.520
that you are both feminists,
and I think strong role models

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:10.356
for many women out there.

00:16:10.356 --> 00:16:11.730
And I'm wondering
what your hopes

00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:16.740
are for the women's
movement, and in writing

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:18.615
this manifesto, and et cetera.

00:16:18.615 --> 00:16:19.380
JENNIFER NADEL: Well,
it's interesting.

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:21.510
You talked about the timing,
because two years ago,

00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:23.700
when we started
writing it, Gillian

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:26.062
had this very
strong sense that it

00:16:26.062 --> 00:16:27.270
should be called a manifesto.

00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:30.940
And everyone was like, women
don't want a manifesto.

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:31.800
It's too political.

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:32.880
It's too dogmatic.

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:33.660
No one cares.

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:34.920
No one cares.

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:36.150
And Gillian just had--

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:39.570
I think because, well, for many
reasons, but that meditation.

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:42.160
You know, when you
meditate regularly, you--

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.020
anyway, you intuit.

00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:45.730
She's got a very
strong intuition.

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:47.938
That's what I'm trying to
say about my writing buddy.

00:16:47.938 --> 00:16:51.270
But it turns out,
two years on, no one

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:53.490
is saying we don't
need a manifesto.

00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:55.410
Unfortunately, no
one is saying, why

00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:57.720
have you written a
manifesto for women?

00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:00.330
Unfortunately,
it's all too clear

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:01.980
that we do need something.

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:07.410
And our hope is-- we're all
going to need to be resilient.

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:09.450
Activism is no longer a choice.

00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:10.950
It's now an essential.

00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:13.920
All of us who have the
capacity and the voice

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:16.560
need to show up, particularly
for those who are

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:19.150
too scared and most at risk.

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:22.569
And if we're going to do that,
we need to develop resilience,

00:17:22.569 --> 00:17:24.540
because just as you
can burn out from work,

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:26.160
you can burn up from activism.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:27.829
And there's no point
in going into it

00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:31.830
if you're driven by your
ego, because often there

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:34.140
are no quick results.

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:38.310
And often it is just about
showing up and saying, I care.

00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:39.510
I believe.

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:40.650
I'm here.

00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:43.825
I'm not going away.

00:17:43.825 --> 00:17:44.700
Sorry, this is very--

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:46.410
GILLIAN ANDERSON: No, go ahead.

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:52.260
JENNIFER NADEL: Anyway, so this
book is really a blueprint.

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.481
It's a handbook
and it's a manual.

00:17:54.481 --> 00:17:56.730
And one of the things that
we really hope will happen,

00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:59.100
has already started to
happen-- and it only came out

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:03.480
a week ago-- already, it's
very inspiring hearing back

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:04.980
that it is happening,
is that women

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:08.530
will gather together with
other women and start circles.

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:10.696
You know, the image on
the front of the book,

00:18:10.696 --> 00:18:12.570
if we have an image of
the book-- yes, there.

00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:13.810
There.

00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:16.860
It is a circle.

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:19.680
So gathering together with
one or more other women

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:22.530
and having the conversations
that are in the book,

00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:25.080
doing the work that
is in the book,

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:27.600
and then you'll
see there's a link.

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:30.900
You know, the circles, there
are three circles linked

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:32.100
on the cover.

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:34.890
And then linking up
with other women,

00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:37.140
and growing and
growing and growing.

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:39.580
So I hope that it
will be very relevant.

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:41.760
And we hope that women
will find other women

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:46.470
whether in the workplace,
online, school gates,

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:49.350
going into whatever
age-- schools,

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:52.560
old people's homes-- and
just starting conversations,

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:53.520
forming connections.

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:57.570
Because whenever two or more
women are gathered together,

00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:00.790
amazing things can happen.

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:03.880
LAURA SLABIN: Do you have
any role models today

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:06.340
that you look at as we
think about how to mobilize

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:10.180
or who you're having
these circles with?

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:13.390
GILLIAN ANDERSON: One of
the most amazing young women

00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:15.880
out there today is
Malala Yousafzai

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:19.270
and how incredibly
courageous and articulate

00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:23.310
she is, standing up for
education in schools

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:28.360
at the cost of quite a lot and
in the face of quite a lot,

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:34.150
in a way that we certainly don't
yet anyway have that experience

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:39.020
in are apparently
free countries.

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:42.070
LAURA SLABIN: And as
we think about impact,

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:44.830
I think a lot of us at Google
think about impact at scale,

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:47.860
because our company is all
about reaching people at scale.

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:50.710
And I'm curious if you have
any suggestions for those

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:54.310
of us here who do want to have a
larger impact of what you think

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:58.864
we can be doing at scale
to make a difference.

00:19:58.864 --> 00:20:01.030
JENNIFER NADEL: Telling it
as it is, not shying away

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:05.650
from the truth, and providing
a platform for other people

00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:07.930
to organize and to connect.

00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:09.790
That's one of the
things that we've

00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:12.850
been looking for is a way of--

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:15.055
women joining together
face-to-face is essential.

00:20:15.055 --> 00:20:18.700
But how can we all join up.

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:22.960
So many of us wake up at
3 o'clock in the morning,

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:24.820
and that's the moment
when we actually want

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:26.329
to connect with someone else.

00:20:26.329 --> 00:20:28.870
And that's the moment when it's
not appropriate most the time

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:31.800
to connect with someone else.

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:35.190
So you can come up with a way.

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:37.215
LAURA SLABIN: I'm
often up at 3:00 AM.

00:20:37.215 --> 00:20:38.340
JENNIFER NADEL: All of us--

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:41.020
GILLIAN ANDERSON: I've got
two answers to this question.

00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:44.380
My first response was,
kindness is contagious.

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:47.620
And we really, really
need more kindness

00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:50.900
in the world today than
ever before, I think.

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:54.790
And it is contagious,
and that can scale up.

00:20:54.790 --> 00:21:01.090
But also, we are interested in
creating a community of women

00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:03.430
online as well as in person.

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:09.010
And so much of that has to do
with funding and sponsorship

00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:14.830
and ideas, ideas from people who
know how to make that happen,

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:18.700
to create a safe place
for women to communicate

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:21.940
and to communicate about
things that are not

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:25.990
just important to them and
their experience with this book,

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:32.290
but also communicate in an
altruistic way about how they

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:35.547
are going out into
the world and showing

00:21:35.547 --> 00:21:37.630
that the change that they're
working on the inside

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:40.390
is having impact on the outside.

00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:42.920
And we say women specifically
for the community,

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:46.210
because there's
a lot of violence

00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:47.500
against women out there.

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:50.590
And there's a lot of
women who experience

00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:52.150
that on a daily basis.

00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:54.100
And creating a
safe place for them

00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:57.370
to be able to talk
openly and feel

00:21:57.370 --> 00:22:01.900
like they're not
getting further abuse

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:04.930
is a really important thing.

00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:07.990
LAURA SLABIN: Trolls online,
it's definitely an issue.

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:12.140
So the manifesto is obviously
a manifesto for women,

00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:15.980
but I'm curious, do you think
your principles apply equally

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:16.480
to men?

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:20.175
And why is it not a
manifesto for all?

00:22:20.175 --> 00:22:21.550
JENNIFER NADEL:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:23.830
All the men we know
who've read the book

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:25.540
love it and say what about me?

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:28.314
And the truth is that any
man can read this book

00:22:28.314 --> 00:22:29.230
and get a lot from it.

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:32.230
And if you take the
cover off, there's

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:34.700
a really anonymous thing.

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:37.600
So if you're embarrassed about
reading a manifesto for women,

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:41.530
you guys, just
take the cover off.

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:43.302
But yeah, the principles
are universal.

00:22:43.302 --> 00:22:44.260
They apply to everyone.

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:46.480
But for the reasons
that Gillian said,

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:47.800
we need to start with women.

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:52.150
Women do 75% of the
work across the globe,

00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:55.630
earn 10% of the wages, and
own 1% of the property.

00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:58.780
We need to start
with us and also

00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:03.610
because a lot of the time
as feminists we're fighting

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:08.740
for access to 50% of a
system that doesn't work,

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:13.630
a system that has left us with
facing runaway climate change,

00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:16.120
hate crimes on the rise,
depression on the rise,

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:18.790
self-harm on the rise,
inequality growing, things

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:21.280
that we know are not OK.

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:22.975
And yet, our system
doesn't fix them.

00:23:22.975 --> 00:23:25.570
It exacerbates them.

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:27.400
So part of our hope
for the book as well

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:29.650
is that it's not
just about trying

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:31.750
to get 50% of a broken system.

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:33.470
It's about a paradigm shift.

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:37.030
It's about co-creating a
world that works for women

00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:40.760
and for men, because I think men
are as trapped by our existing

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:41.260
structures.

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:43.150
Because they're
really about power.

00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:46.060
They're really about units
of labor that traditionally

00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:48.410
have been male, and
so no one needed

00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:51.400
to take account of the fact that
they may have responsibilities

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:52.450
beyond the workplace.

00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:55.960
But most men today do, and
most men today want to.

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:59.170
So it's about
together saying, as we

00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:01.720
were saying about
Hollywood, we've

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:03.430
got to say it in every area.

00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:04.810
This is not what we want.

00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:05.490
It doesn't work.

00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:06.820
Actually, we want equality.

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:08.350
Actually, we want fairness.

00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:11.440
Actually, we will take
home less in our pay packet

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:14.260
so that we can take care
of those who are sick,

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:17.320
or who aren't able to earn
in the way that we are.

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:21.929
It's about co-creating
a fairer world.

00:24:21.929 --> 00:24:23.470
LAURA SLABIN: One
thing you discussed

00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:25.780
was a gratitude practice.

00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:29.310
I find that much
easier than meditation.

00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:30.970
And I just thought
it'd be fun if you

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:34.570
would share with us what was
in your gratitude practice

00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:37.630
yesterday.

00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:40.880
GILLIAN ANDERSON: Well,
yesterday was a snow day.

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:43.180
So I had a lot of
gratitude yesterday.

00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:49.190
I had gratitude for pajamas,
and snow, and a hotel room,

00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:51.050
which sometimes is really nice.

00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:58.630
And I mean, most of the
time my gratitude has

00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:00.610
to do with the simplest things.

00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:03.520
One of the statistics
in the book,

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:05.080
I believe if I've
got this right,

00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:07.870
is that if you have
a refrigerator,

00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:13.330
you are richer than
75% of the population.

00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:19.892
So I'm grateful
for a lot, a lot.

00:25:19.892 --> 00:25:20.850
LAURA SLABIN: Jennifer?

00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:23.450
JENNIFER NADEL: Yeah, I had the
snow, because I love the snow.

00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:25.230
I've got my son
with me, so that's

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:27.350
a huge source of gratitude.

00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:31.400
I found cabs, even though I was
told there would be no cabs.

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:33.800
I found them, and the
drivers were all lovely.

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:37.070
And for me, those
moments of kindness,

00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:38.780
those moments of
human connection,

00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:43.410
often just little things like
buying a newspaper from someone

00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:47.090
and forming a human contact,
not just throwing the money

00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:50.180
and taking the goods,
but actually connecting.

00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:56.030
You know, love is all
around if we're open to it.

00:25:56.030 --> 00:25:57.500
LAURA SLABIN: We have time--

00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:59.760
this will be the last question.

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:04.820
What's next for you
after writing this book?

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:07.850
JENNIFER NADEL: Aside from
trying to start a movement,

00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:10.670
I'm going to go and
write my second novel,

00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:12.440
maybe even finish my PhD.

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:15.650
Oh, and I'm making a film for
the Green Party in the UK.

00:26:18.254 --> 00:26:19.670
GILLIAN ANDERSON:
Immediately next

00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:23.120
is actually a big
lump of nothing,

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:27.940
which I have been asking
for for a really long time.

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:31.370
And a series of what,
on the one hand,

00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:33.620
might be unfortunate
events, have actually

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:36.470
turned into fortunate
nothingness.

00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:40.570
And because I've been pretty
much either on a plane,

00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:45.530
on a set, or with my kids
for years, years, and hearing

00:26:45.530 --> 00:26:47.534
myself say, I've
got to slow down.

00:26:47.534 --> 00:26:48.450
I've got to slow down.

00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:52.370
I've got to-- I've got
to, you know, and I've

00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:59.650
been given this space and
time to clean out my closet,

00:26:59.650 --> 00:27:04.100
clean out my purse,
explore my neighborhoods.

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:09.410
One of the biggest things is
actually I do a lot of work

00:27:09.410 --> 00:27:11.120
speaking up about
human trafficking

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:12.580
and modern-day slavery.

00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:15.770
And one of the things that
drives me a little bit crazy

00:27:15.770 --> 00:27:18.050
is that the busyness
of my schedule

00:27:18.050 --> 00:27:21.050
means that I can't
necessarily be on the ground

00:27:21.050 --> 00:27:26.720
or be as physically
involved as I'd like to be.

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:30.870
So that's partly what I'd like
to do is to get physically more

00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:31.892
involved.

00:27:31.892 --> 00:27:34.100
LAURA SLABIN: That sounds
like an aggressive and busy

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:34.958
nothingness.

00:27:34.958 --> 00:27:37.298
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:39.060
Is there anything--

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:40.726
GILLIAN ANDERSON:
Every once in a while.

00:27:40.726 --> 00:27:41.860
JENNIFER NADEL: Good spot.

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:43.610
LAURA SLABIN: Any part
of the nothingness,

00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:46.532
like sitting on a beach
or hiking or meditating?

00:27:46.532 --> 00:27:47.490
GILLIAN ANDERSON: Sure.

00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:48.502
I'm sure there will be.

00:27:48.502 --> 00:27:49.460
I'm sure there will be.

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:53.299
I might have to be
taught how to do that.

00:27:53.299 --> 00:27:55.340
LAURA SLABIN: So I just
want to thank both of you

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:59.120
for being here with
your busy schedule,

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:02.970
and I hope that we
do start a movement.

00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:04.380
So thank you very much.

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:06.130
GILLIAN ANDERSON: Thank
you for having us.

00:28:06.130 --> 00:28:07.940
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:16.690
as
