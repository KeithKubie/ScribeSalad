00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.359
&gt;&gt; All right Charles, what do you think?

00:00:01.359 --> 00:00:04.210
&gt;&gt; Okay, so being in the version space just means

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.920
that you're consistent with the, data that you see. Right?

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:07.855
&gt;&gt; Good. Mm-hm.

00:00:07.855 --> 00:00:11.450
&gt;&gt; Okay, so we should be able to very quickly go through this. So X1,

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.200
just copy X1 over. Well, if we look at the training data, in the first

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.690
case, X1 is zero and the output is zero. Second case, X1 is one and

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.210
the output is one. So that is, in fact, consistent with just always copying X1.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.360
&gt;&gt; So that is in the

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.220
version space, right?

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.184
&gt;&gt; Right. And without even having to think about it, since x1 is in

00:00:29.184 --> 00:00:30.864
the version space, doing the opposite of

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:32.790
x1 can't possibly be in the version space.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:33.220
&gt;&gt; Agreed.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.680
&gt;&gt; So let's skip that.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.790
&gt;&gt; Looking at x2, we can see that in the first case, you go

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.680
x2 0, c of x is 0. Yeah, so yeah that's looking good. That's consistent

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.780
so far. But then on the next row you get 0 and then you

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.980
get the, opposite of 0. You get 1, the compliment of 0. So, that definitely

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.940
is inconsistent with just copying over X2, so you can't have X2

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.150
and by very similar reasoning you can't have the opposite of X2.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.240
&gt;&gt; Agreed.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.510
&gt;&gt; Okay, so, true is clearly not consistent because

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.144
we got a 0 once and a 1 once.

00:01:04.144 --> 00:01:04.870
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.440
&gt;&gt; And by the same argument false is not consistent because we

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.510
got a zero once and a one once. Now or, let's see or.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.830
&gt;&gt; But in case it's not clear, I probably could have been clearer about

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.060
this, but here, zeroes and falses are the same thing and ones and trues

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.830
are the same thing.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.260
&gt;&gt; Right. Just like in C.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.897
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:01:18.897 --> 00:01:21.380
&gt;&gt; Okay. So I just assume everything you do

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.530
is written in C, Michael, so, it just works that

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:24.710
way. In fact there's a C right up there at

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.500
the top of the, at the top of the slide.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.880
&gt;&gt; Yeah so I feel like I should do this. Now I understand what's going on.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.830
&gt;&gt; Right, now it's in C.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.900
&gt;&gt; Much better. Okay, so, or. Or means if either one of them

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.590
is true, then you say yes and, huh! That's actually consistent with or.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.180
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.400
&gt;&gt; Hm. But it is not consistent with and,

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.920
because one and zero would be zero, not one. Second

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.510
case, XOR, well, I already know it's consistent with XOR,

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.620
because I happen to know that that's the target concept.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:55.160
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.112
&gt;&gt; And an equiv would be not

00:01:58.112 --> 00:02:02.810
consistent. Though interestingly, not equivalent would be consistent.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.360
&gt;&gt; Yes, because not equivalent is XOR.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.120
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah, that's right.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.291
&gt;&gt; All

00:02:06.291 --> 00:02:09.630
right, so that's, yeah, that's it, X1, OR, AND, XOR.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:10.610
&gt;&gt; Excellent.

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:11.420
&gt;&gt; Cool.
