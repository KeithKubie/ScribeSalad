00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.210
On your math quiz, you earn
5 points for each question

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:05.900
that you answer correctly.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.850
In the table above, q represents
the number of questions

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.380
that you answer correctly
on your math quiz,

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.290
and p represents the
total number of points

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:16.960
that you score on your quiz.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.900
The relationship between
these two variables

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.430
can be expressed by the
following equation--

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.320
p is equal to 5q, where
p is the points you get

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.760
and q is the number of questions
you answered correctly.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.300
And you could see
that in the table.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.980
If q is 0, if you got
no questions right,

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.290
you get 0 points.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.445
If you got no questions
right, well, 5 times 0

00:00:36.445 --> 00:00:37.910
is going to be 0.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.880
If you get one question
right, well, 1 times 5 is 5.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.930
You get 5 points per question.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.705
Two questions right,
well, 2 times 5 is 10.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:50.970
3 times 5 is 15.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.600
So this all makes sense.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.010
So then they ask us, which
of the following statements

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.510
are true?

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.427
Check all that apply.

00:00:57.427 --> 00:00:58.510
So let's think about this.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.490
They say the
dependent variable is

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.450
the number of points you score.

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.390
So when you think about
what's happening here,

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.250
is your number of
points you score

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.420
is being driven by how many
questions you get right.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.610
It's not like somehow the
teacher says you got 15 points

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.860
and now you have to get
exactly three questions right.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:17.943
It's the other way around.

00:01:17.943 --> 00:01:19.730
The number of
questions you get right

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.970
is the independent
variable, and that's

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.176
driving the number
of points you score.

00:01:24.176 --> 00:01:25.550
So the number of
points you score

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.460
is the dependent variable.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.630
And typically, the convention is
to have the dependent variable

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.020
be equal to some
expression involving

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.080
the independent variable.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.670
And you see that
right over here.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.869
p is dependent on
what happens to q.

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:42.410
Depending on the
number of questions,

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.260
you multiply it by
5, and you get p.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.520
So the dependent variable is
the number of points you score.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.080
The dependent
variable is the number

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.410
of questions you
answer correctly.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:51.909
No, we've already
talked about that.

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:53.700
That's the independent variable.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.020
The independent variable is
the number of points you score.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.910
No, that's not right.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:59.845
That's the dependent variable.

00:01:59.845 --> 00:02:01.510
The independent
variable is a number

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.090
of questions you
answer correctly.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.881
Well, that's right.

00:02:03.881 --> 00:02:06.360
That's what's driving
the dependent variable.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.660
And we can check our answer.
