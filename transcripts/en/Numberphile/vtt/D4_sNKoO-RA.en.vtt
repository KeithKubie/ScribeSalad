00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.560
BRADY HARAN: The last video here
on "Numberphile" was all

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.240
about gaps between
prime numbers.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.470
Specifically, it was about this
paper, which is a proof

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.370
that's just been published.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.280
And what it basically says is
no matter how high you go in

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.660
the number line, no matter how
high you count, there is

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.140
always a pair of numbers still
to come with a gap of less

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.600
than 70 million.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.550
What that exact number is,
it doesn't quite say.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.240
70 million sounds like
a really big number.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.230
But when you think how big
numbers can get and how rare

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.760
prime numbers become as you get
higher and higher, it's

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.700
pretty close.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.250
But what's really exciting is
that a lot of people are

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.150
saying this paper is taking us
a step closer to proving the

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:46.920
twin prime conjecture.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.480
And what that says is that there
are an infinite number

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.230
of prime numbers separated
by just two.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.850
So that means no matter how high
you count, when you get

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.730
to a googolplex or Graham's
number or well beyond, there

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.370
is still an infinite number of
prime numbers ahead of you

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.830
that are separated
by just two.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.450
And when you get that high,
prime numbers become

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:11.770
incredibly rare.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.220
So to think that all these
pairings are still out there

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.670
is quite an extraordinary
thought.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.340
Now, this proof is 56 pages
long, and it's probably beyond

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.520
most people.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.680
But we did make a video about
it, and I hope you've watched

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.440
that already.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.720
And if you did, there was few
off takes and a few extra bits

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.750
and pieces from that video that
we didn't use that I've

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.840
now put into this video.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.930
So have a watch of that, and
then I'll tell you what I

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.490
think this paper at the end.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.280
ED COPELAND: I love it.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.710
I love it.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.580
I get excited about everything,
but I've always

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:45.410
loved numbers.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.700
And just look at the magnitude
of the kind of things.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.290
How on earth does someone
come up with that

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.700
these are the primes?

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.350
They're the largest
twin pair primes.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.970
And who knows what the
significance of these will be?

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.680
I love it just for the sake of
mathematics and the numbers.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.170
And I'm full of admiration
for people that can this.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.900
When I was 18, I had a decision
to make, whether to

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.910
do physics or whether
to do mathematics.

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.600
And I went the physics route,
and I'm very happy I did.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.950
But if I'd have gone through the
mathematics route, this is

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.530
the kind of thing I would
have loved to do.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.340
But I'm not sure I'm
good enough.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.370
Ones that differ by two are
called twin primes.

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.640
You also get, of course, ones
that differ by four.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.710
These are called
cousin primes.

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.330
And there's even those
that differ by six.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.610
And these are called
sexy primes.

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.350
TONY PADILLA: Now, in principle,
it's believed

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.270
there's an infinite number
of these twin primes.

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.740
It's believed there's an
infinite number of these

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:46.530
cousin primes.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:47.470
It's believed there's
an infinite number

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:48.320
of these sexy primes.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.060
In fact, it's believed that
there is an infinite number of

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.130
each possible even gap
between the primes.

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.050
But it's not been proven.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.440
So what we have here is
a pair of primes.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.570
And they differ by 2n.

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.100
What Zhang has shown is that
there are an infinite number

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.280
of prime numbers where
this difference does

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:19.010
not exceed 70 million.

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.660
There are an infinity
of these guys.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.810
What's even more remarkable,
actually, about the proof that

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.210
Zhang came up with is that it
didn't actually do anything

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.090
completely different.

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.440
It was really just application
of existing ideas but just

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.570
perseverance.

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:35.620
And that's quite unusual.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.600
Sometimes when something hasn't
been proven for a very,

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.640
very long time, it really need
some sort of order and

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.110
magnitude shift in the
way people think.

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:43.470
But this didn't happen here.

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.910
He just really stuck at it,
perhaps more than others had.

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.950
It's a pretty impressive
proof.

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:51.820
There's no doubt about it.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:52.060
Here it is--

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.470
56 pages of it.

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.330
So 70 million--

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.260
I was talking about potentially
the googolplex,

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.500
Graham's number, these kind
of crazy numbers.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.110
But even then, there's gaps
of only 70 million.

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.190
So it's a tiny number
in that context.

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.450
But actually, of course,
it's a lot bigger

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.920
than 2 or 4 or 6--

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.980
it is believed that the methods
that Zhang used could

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.670
be optimized even more.

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.130
And you could get this
number down to 16.

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.870
That's what's anticipated
here.

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.120
So that would be pretty
impressive.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.410
If there's an infinite number
of prime numbers that are

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.692
separated by only 16 numbers,
that would be really

00:04:31.692 --> 00:04:32.600
impressive.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.150
BRADY HARAN: But not 2.

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:34.370
They don't reckon he
can get it to 2.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.190
TONY PADILLA: It's not
anticipated that these methods

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.050
would actually get
it down to 2.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.410
16 is the odds.

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.910
And it's related to the fact
that a lot of what Zhang did

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.870
was based on work
of these guys--

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.600
Goldston, Pintz, and Yildirim.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.800
And they almost got there.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.480
They almost got there.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.730
What they proved--

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.310
well, they proved a
couple of things.

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.370
One thing that they
proved was that--

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.680
so you have this average
gap of log n.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.950
So that's the average gap of
between prime numbers.

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.050
So for example, if n is a
googolplex, this average gap

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.280
is around the google, is
of that order anyway.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.650
So now the question is, what
did Goldston, Pintz and

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:24.800
Yildirim show?

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.020
They showed that you take
any fraction, any

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.280
fraction you want--

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.670
so I take some large n and
you take any fraction you

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:32.460
want of this gap--

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.470
and I could prove that the gap
between primes is less than.

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.750
So I take some fraction,
let me call it epsilon.

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:44.080
So any epsilon greater
than zero.

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.110
GPY showed that there exists--

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:49.540
so I'm going to show you a
little bit of mathematical

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:50.790
symbol here, that
there exists.

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:55.410
That means there exists,
that backward e.

00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:04.400
There exists prime pairs
separated by less than epsilon

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.320
log n for larger N. So
you might think,

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.030
so what is he showing?

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:10.720
And this is any epsilon.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.760
This just falls short of
proving the conjecture.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.250
Now, why does it just
fall short?

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.360
Well, in principal, I could just
take n bigger and bigger

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.210
and bigger and bigger.

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.270
If n's finite, then
OK that's fine.

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:25.370
But n can be infinite here.
n can really get big.

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.010
So that's not enough, because it
just falls short of proving

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:32.720
the conjecture, because we're
talking big n here.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.110
And n, essentially, you want
to tend n to infinity

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:37.720
ultimately to prove that there
are an infinite number of

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:38.970
these pairs.

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:44.230
You can take this fraction
to be arbitrarily small.

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:47.490
But the thing it's multiplying
is getting arbitrarily big.

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:53.670
So it's not clear that this
overall size is actually

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:56.050
getting smaller and smaller,
can stay small,

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:57.290
can even stay finite.

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:59.060
It may even become infinite.

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.600
So they fell just short of
proving the conjecture.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.440
BRADY HARAN: Our hero of the
day today has also fallen

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.440
short of proving the
big conjecture.

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.550
TONY PADILLA: He least proved
that there was a finite gap,

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:14.060
that ultimately there
is a finite gap.

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.780
And there's an infinite number
of these guys with finite gap.

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:18.820
So what GPY did show--
and this is where

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:21.090
the 16 comes in--

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:23.700
is they showed that if
something called the

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:28.600
Elliott-Halberstam conjecture,
and we don't know it's true.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.090
It's expected to be true, but
they don't know it's true.

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:35.000
Then there are an infinite
number of prime numbers which

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.140
differ by less than 16.

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:39.060
So this is where the
16 comes in.

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.930
BRADY HARAN: Just to go back to
our hero of today, what is

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:45.170
it about his proof that makes
70 million seem such an

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:47.340
arbitrary number, and yet it's
such a perfect round number?

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:52.390
TONY PADILLA: So when people do
number theory, how do they

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:54.980
actually go about doing
these proofs?

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:57.370
They tend to use sieve theory.

00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:02.370
Now, the simplest version of a
sieve theory comes back from

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:05.020
ancient Greece, a guy
called Aristophanes.

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:06.925
ED COPELAND: He wanted to work
out what all the primes were,

00:08:06.925 --> 00:08:09.400
so he began by just writing
out all the numbers.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:14.560
So he begins with 2, because
you know one is not

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.580
defined as a prime.

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:18.420
So he begins with 2, 3, 4.

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:21.000
And I'll do 31 and 32.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.640
And it goes on and
on, of course.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.770
And what he said is
you begin at 2.

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:27.370
That's going to be your
first number.

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:31.350
And cross out every number
that's divisible by 2.

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:32.049
BRADY HARAN: Why?

00:08:32.049 --> 00:08:35.039
ED COPELAND: Because that
can't be a prime.

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:38.840
A prime is defined as a number
that's divisible only by

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:44.560
itself, possibly by 1, but
1 doesn't count usually.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:45.270
We begin with 2.

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:47.470
So 4 across all the
even numbers now--

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:48.860
immediately wipe out.

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:49.510
I'm sieving.

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:51.010
They're falling through
the sieve.

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:52.920
That's exactly what's
going on.

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.170
And so I've got rid of that.

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:57.470
So now you move to 3, which
is the next one by itself.

00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:58.530
And you do the same thing.

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:02.150
Well, 6 already has
been ruled out.

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:04.000
But 9 goes.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.060
12 is already gone.

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:08.820
15 goes, 27 goes, 30 is gone.

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:10.520
4 is already gone.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.736
5 is the next one.

00:09:12.736 --> 00:09:15.660
So then you start
going through.

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:19.380
Anything divisible
by 5 is removed.

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:20.670
So 10 is already gone.

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:21.740
15 is already gone.

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:22.750
20 is already gone.

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:25.120
25 hasn't gone yet,
but has now.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.600
What you're now left with
actually are all the primes.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:34.192
If I just label the ones that I
left, you've got 11, 13, 17,

00:09:34.192 --> 00:09:39.840
19, 23, 29, 31.

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:41.510
I've got all the primes
up to 31.

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:45.200
And this is the technique that
you can use to actually sieve

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.240
out the primes.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.080
This would give me
all the primes.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.720
If I had enough computing power
and enough time and I

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.740
could do it faster, I would
get all the primes just by

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:56.952
writing out this series
and just doing it.

00:09:56.952 --> 00:09:58.103
BRADY HARAN: And all
infinity of it.

00:09:58.103 --> 00:09:59.050
ED COPELAND: And all
infinity of it.

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:01.880
It took me a long, long time,
an infinite amount of time.

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:03.577
But I could do it.

00:10:03.577 --> 00:10:04.920
BRADY HARAN: Do you know how
long it would take you?

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.500
ED COPELAND: Infinite
amount of time.

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.270
So we haven't got that.

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:11.630
The funding agencies won't fund
us for that kind of--

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:12.910
BRADY HARAN: We don't have an
infinite amount of time.

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:16.160
We've got another 26 minutes.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.340
ED COPELAND: What people have
done is they've refined this

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:24.650
sieve in such a way that it's
not as accurate as this.

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:27.910
So maybe you think of it as a
bit more coarse-grained sieve.

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:32.070
And so more things will
fall through.

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:36.570
But what you are left with,
rather than having these fine

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:39.300
primes immediately left, what
you're left with are groups of

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:42.870
numbers with which you
improve your chances

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:44.190
of finding the primes.

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:47.730
So you have some idea of the
kind of values of numbers

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:48.910
you're looking for.

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:51.000
You develop your sieve
accordingly.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.460
And then all the other stuff
comes through, and you're left

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:56.030
with this range of numbers,
within which you hope you're

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:57.940
going to find these
big primes.

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:00.570
Just look at the sizes that
we're talking about.

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:06.550
And so these modified sieves are
used by mathematicians to

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:11.350
try and establish these
bounded sets.

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:16.390
And the work of Zhang has been
based on some earlier work by

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:24.270
a group of mathematicians who
almost got there to find this

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:26.215
bound, but couldn't
quite make it.

00:11:26.215 --> 00:11:29.260
And what he did is he basically
modified the sieve

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.580
that he was using, which meant
he had just a slightly

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:37.370
different way of getting the
bigger prime numbers.

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:39.950
And from it, he was able to
demonstrate that indeed there

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:44.050
is a bound just based on the
type of sieve he was using.

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:46.740
And this bound turned
out to be 70 million

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:47.910
that he came up with.

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:52.030
BRADY HARAN: So 70 million is an
artifact of the sieve that

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:53.500
he arbitrarily chose.

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.380
ED COPELAND: There
are two things.

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:58.620
There's a sieve and then there's
something which I just

00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:00.370
can't get my head around
called the level of

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:05.040
distribution which tells you
how the prime numbers, how

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:09.550
regular they become when you're
looking on for very

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:10.790
large values.

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:15.610
And it was this combination that
he used and out of it,

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:17.960
which no one else had
been able to do.

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:24.790
And there is a nice aspect
to this story, which is

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:27.900
a, he's over 50.

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:29.110
And no one had knew about him.

00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:30.850
He works at the University
of New Hampshire.

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:35.450
He'd obviously been working
away, which means you can do

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:37.580
great math over 50.

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:39.470
You're not totally burnt out.

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:45.420
And b, he wasn't that he came up
with some phenomenally new

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:46.170
breakthrough.

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:50.100
He just kept plugging away at
the techniques people have

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:50.730
been doing.

00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:53.630
And just by doing that he
was able to modify them

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:55.190
sufficiently to make this.

00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:59.460
And he sent it to the
journal in April.

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:04.170
And the journal editor,
to their credit--

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:07.050
mathematics journals must be
inundated with people saying

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:09.440
they've solved these problems,
because the problems are so

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:10.900
easy to say.

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:15.610
There's an infinite number of
primes who differ by two.

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:18.520
I remember trying to prove this
at school, thinking that

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:19.877
can't be that difficult.

00:13:19.877 --> 00:13:21.427
BRADY HARAN: The "Numberphile"
inbox is

00:13:21.427 --> 00:13:22.739
inundated with people claiming--

00:13:22.739 --> 00:13:23.700
ED COPELAND: I'm sure it is.

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:27.200
So to their credit, the
editors of the journal

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.210
realized this guy knew what
he was talking about.

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:30.940
Apparently, the paper
was beautifully

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:32.640
written, crystal clear.

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:34.400
And they fast-tracked
it through

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.450
the refereeing process.

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:39.280
They must have some way of
putting it on a conveyor belt

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:43.200
that sends it to the referees
who all unanimously said this

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:46.720
is potentially really
important.

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:50.310
TONY PADILLA: I scanned the
proof, but I went online and

00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:54.470
found some really nice
explanations, because one

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:58.550
thing that happened is he
gave a talk at Harvard.

00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:00.130
And it was extremely
well-received.

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:02.470
And people were very
excited about it.

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:03.530
Everybody loves prime numbers.

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:05.070
So there were people coming
from different

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:07.620
fields to see this talk.

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:10.140
But what people have done is
some people who were at that

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:13.980
talk have put some really nice
explanations online of what

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:16.890
the proof involved.

00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:21.425
So those I find particularly
useful, because they were

00:14:21.425 --> 00:14:23.230
written by people who weren't
number theorists.

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:26.610
And I'm not a number theorist,
so that was very useful to me.

00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:31.990
Incidentally, there's a nice
little quirk of fate which

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:36.210
happened while that talk was
going on, in that a paper came

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:38.070
online while that talk was
going on, which actually

00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:41.390
proved another one of these
crazy conjectures.

00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:45.320
And it was the Goldbach
conjecture, at least a

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:48.510
weakened version of the
Goldbach conjecture.

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:50.250
So the original Goldbach
conjecture, which is one of

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:53.285
the great problems
of mathematics--

00:14:56.830 --> 00:14:57.880
you get one of these
Millennium prizes

00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:00.150
if you solve it--

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:04.400
is that to prove that every even
number can be written as

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.440
the sum of two primes.

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:10.970
So the weakened version this guy
proved that came out while

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:16.390
Zhang was giving his talk was
that every odd number greater

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:19.670
than five can be written as
the sum of three primes.

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:21.520
So he proved there is a slightly
weakened version of

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:22.770
the original conjecture.

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:28.610
There's been two really big
events within number theory

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:30.570
coming together at
the same time.

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:35.560
And the implications for
this in terms of--

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.650
now that there's new ideas
coming in, there's even hope

00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:43.155
that maybe one could solve
the Riemann hypothesis.

00:15:43.155 --> 00:15:45.540
So the Riemann hypothesis
states that there's a

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:48.240
particular function called the
Riemann function, which I can

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.960
write down quite
straightforwardly.

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:56.690
It has the form z through zed is
the sum of n of one over n

00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:58.450
to the zed.

00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:00.170
The Riemann hypothesis
asks where are the

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:01.420
zeros of this function.

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:07.660
It seems what he says
is that they all lie

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:08.580
in the complex plane.

00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:10.560
I'm thinking, where are they
in the complex plane?

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:15.460
They all lie on the line with
real number one half.

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:16.600
Not obvious--

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:18.370
it's a hypothesis.

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:21.380
Great minds have failed to prove
this time and time and

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:22.430
time again.

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:28.290
And one thing that is hoped is
that now might be progress to

00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:29.210
proving this.

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:31.480
So all these things together,
this kind of hope that's

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:32.680
there's going to be
real progress now.

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:36.290
Incidentally, we used this
Riemann zeta function in

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:37.480
quantum field theory as well.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:41.800
So this has applications beyond
just number theory.

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:42.730
BRADY HARAN: You're
a physicist, not a

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:44.240
mathematician.

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:46.570
Does this excite you when you
read about this and see this?

00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:49.270
TONY PADILLA: I think everybody
loves prime numbers.

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:53.110
I think you can't fail to
love prime numbers.

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:54.800
I think the great thing--

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.450
I was thinking about this
because I knew you'd ask me

00:16:57.450 --> 00:16:59.640
that, Brady--

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:03.370
the thing about prime numbers
that I think fascinates

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:06.770
anybody who's interested in
math, physics, that kind of

00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:12.710
thing is that they seemingly
lack some sort of structure.

00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:16.300
We like to think that we
understand nature, that things

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:19.200
ultimately will adhere to some
sort of structure and we could

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.400
make sense of that.

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:23.869
Thus far, prime numbers seem
to sort of evade that

00:17:23.869 --> 00:17:24.170
possibility.

00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:26.680
They seem to just be so
higgeldy-piggeldy.

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:30.320
What is the structure that
underpins prime numbers?

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:33.700
And these sort of conjectures
are sort of going some way

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:41.040
towards giving prime numbers
these elusive things that have

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:46.910
thus far refused to come on to
the grip of our trying to make

00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:49.370
sense to them and to apply
structure to them.

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:52.200
These sort of conjectures,
improving them is heading some

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:53.770
way to doing that.

00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:57.140
And that's why it's sort of
like, is it an almost final

00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:59.270
frontier of our understanding
in some way?

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:02.220
We're making sense
of something--

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:04.395
everybody can understand why
three is a prime number, a

00:18:04.395 --> 00:18:05.400
five is a prime number.

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:07.370
And it's something that's
familiar to you.

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:11.360
And yet seemingly we understand
so little about it.

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:12.190
That's the fascination.

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:14.320
BRADY HARAN: Do you know what
else a prime number is?

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:14.630
TONY PADILLA: What?

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:15.690
BRADY HARAN: 19.

00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:18.660
Stewart Downing.

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:20.120
TONY PADILLA: He's has a good
second half of the season,

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:21.512
Stewart Downing.

00:18:21.512 --> 00:18:23.440
BRADY HARAN: Was he
a good signing?

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:26.255
TONY PADILLA: I don't want
to say definitely yet.

00:18:26.255 --> 00:18:27.870
He had a good second
half of the season.

00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:28.840
I will say that.

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:30.090
He's improved.

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:35.760
BRADY HARAN: So this paper by
Yitang Zhang, which is, by all

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:37.580
accounts, an extraordinary
piece of work.

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:40.930
It's well beyond my
capabilities.

00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:44.390
But I did note it's
56 pages long.

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:46.230
And I think the typesetters
have missed

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:47.510
an opportunity here.

00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:51.420
If they just made the point size
a bit bigger or put a bit

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:55.070
more spacing in there, they
could have got it to 59 pages.

00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:57.146
And that's a twin prime.

00:18:57.146 --> 00:18:58.970
You know that's what
I would have done.
