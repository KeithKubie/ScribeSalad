00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.960
What’s up with society, exactly?

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:06.560
I mean, is it a smoothly functioning whole, with
different parts that fit together to keep it ticking?

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.980
Or is it a jumble of different, competing
groups, constantly at each other’s throats,
struggling for control?

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.000
Or maybe it's, you know, a bunch of people
who are just trying to get through their days.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.700
The fact is, there isn't one answer to the question
of what the nature of society really is.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.560
But all three of the models that I just described

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.240
– society as a well-oiled machine, as a group
of competing interests, and as bunch of people
just interacting with each other –

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.810
they’re all worth considering.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:35.240
Because they each offer their own perspectives
on the social world, and they’re each crucial to
understanding the practice of sociology,

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.280
with histories that can be traced back to
a founding figure in the discipline.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.440
So, let’s talk about paradigms.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:51.100
[Theme Music]

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.120
A paradigm is not some kind of high-tech parachute.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.890
And it doesn’t equal twenty cents.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.040
Instead, a paradigm is basically a model for
how you think about things –

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:05.980
a set of concepts and theories that frames your
perspective on a certain topic, whether it’s Russian
literature or public art or the laws of physics.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.840
And in sociology, theoretical paradigms are
key.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.760
These paradigms are the fundamental assumptions
that sociologists have about the social world,

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.780
the ones that guide their thinking and research.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.960
And that might sound kind of prejudicial at first,
like you’re going into the study of society with
certain biases in mind.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.860
But you need the assumptions that these paradigms
provide, because raw facts don't interpret themselves.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.540
Raw facts are things like "the unemployment
rate last year was 5%," or "Sam is six feet tall," or

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.320
"today a group of people with signs
blocked the highway."

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:36.520
By raw I mean that these facts are just simple
descriptions of empirical reality.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.159
And they don’t come pre-interpreted.

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.509
Is 5% an acceptable unemployment rate?

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:42.100
Or should we be trying to lower it?

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.630
Is six feet tall actually tall?

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:50.060
And are protesters who are blocking a
highway disrupting the order of society, or are
they struggling for their interests?

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.320
The answer to that last one is, of course,
both.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.460
But the important thing to understand is that
either answer requires you to make some assumptions
about the social world.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.140
The other important thing is that those two
different answers will be useful in different situations,
for answering different kinds of questions.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.640
For instance, if you're trying to understand
how and why society can hold together at all,

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.060
then looking at protests as signs of strain
or disruption might be more useful.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.640
But if you're trying to understand why people
protest, then trying to understand how they're
pursuing their interests might be better.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.200
Now, all this might sound kind of unscientific:
Physics doesn't need "interpretation" exactly.

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.019
Math doesn't need multiple "perspectives."

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.680
But actually, they do.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.860
All scientific disciplines make assumptions about
the world, and all scientific disciplines use different
perspectives, depending on the questions they’re asking.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:38.720
In physics, you can understand a bouncing ball
as a nearly uncountable multitude of fundamental
particles, each with its own wave function,

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.000
and all held together by different kinds
of forces at the quantum scale.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.740
Or you can just understand it as simply X
number of grams of rubber moving through space.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.240
The perspective you take will dramatically
change what kinds of questions you want to ask.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.220
All sciences ask different kinds of questions and
have different assumptions for answering them.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.020
And raw facts always need some kind of
perspective in order to make them useful.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.720
Now, if we want to talk about different kinds
of questions and perspectives in sociology,

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.380
a good place to start is with something we
brought up last episode:

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:10.420
the fact that sociology looks at society at
all levels, at all scales, from the huge to the tiny.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.060
In other words, sociology is concerned with
both the macro and the micro.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.840
An orientation towards the macro means looking
at the big.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:23.240
When sociologists ask questions at this level,
they're taking a broad focus, looking at the
large-scale structures that shape society.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.440
Macro questions are things like "What caused
the transition from feudalism to capitalism?"

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.010
or "How does race impact educational achievement?"

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.120
An orientation toward the micro, of course,
means looking at the small.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.060
These questions are concerned more narrowly with
interactions between individuals, asking things like:

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.560
"Do doctors talk to patients of different
races differently?"

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.560
or "How do the members of a certain group
build a group identity?"

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:46.670
Now, it's worth noting that these orientations
aren't completely separate.

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.720
Because, again, the big and the small are
always connected.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.019
Asking how doctors talk to patients of different
races is a micro question, but it also helps

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.030
us begin to understand the macro-level pattern
of racial disparities in healthcare.

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.520
Likewise, asking about how a group builds
its identity could have macro impacts,

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.460
because it could help explain how large social
structures are reproduced and maintained.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.120
Now that we understand a little more about
the different scales that sociology works on,

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.560
we can turn to its main theoretical paradigms,
of which there are three:

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.940
There’s structural functionalism, conflict
theory, and symbolic interactionism.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.940
Let’s start with structural functionalism,
which originated with a French sociologist
named Emile Durkheim.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:26.820
Durkheim imagined society as a kind of organism,
with different parts that all worked together to
keep it alive and in good health.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.700
Of course, things could go wrong.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:34.260
But this was always imagined by Durkheim
as a malfunction, an illness, or a deviation from
the normal functioning of things.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.860
So the structural functionalist perspective
makes this same basic assumption:

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.620
Society is seen as a complex system whose parts
work together to promote stability and social order.

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.320
And these different “parts" of society are social
structures, relatively stable patterns of social behavior.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.600
For example, Durkheim was extremely interested
in religion, and also in the division of labor,

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.680
or how tasks in a society are divided up.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.390
And these structures are seen as fulfilling
certain social functions.

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:02.200
For instance, the family, in most societies,
fulfills the function of socializing children –
teaching them how to live in that society.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.020
And social functions come in two types: manifest
and latent functions.

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:12.740
Manifest functions are intended or obvious
consequences of a particular structure, while latent
functions are unintended or unrecognized.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.900
For example, we often think of the purpose
of schools as providing children with knowledge
– that’s their manifest function.

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.240
But, schools can also help socialize children.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:26.040
They can have – and historically have had
– the additional purpose of creating workers
who listen to authority and hit deadlines.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.460
That’s a latent function.

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:34.520
Now, along with functions, we also have social
dysfunction, which is any social pattern that
disrupts the smooth operation of society.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.540
Technological development is a powerful driver
of economic improvement, for example, which
is a useful function.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.639
But it’s also a destabilizing force.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.740
New machines can put people out of work.

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:49.480
Someday soon, we may see the social dysfunction
of thousands of long distance truckers being
displaced by self-driving vehicles.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:52.560
And this brings us to one of the problems
with structural functionalism.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:57.760
Since it sees society as fundamentally functional
and stable, it can be really bad at dealing with change.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.840
It can be bad at providing good
explanations for why change happens,

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:06.100
and it can also interpret bad things in
society as having positive functions, which should
therefore not be changed.

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:10.100
To take an extreme example, a structural
functionalist view might imagine that poverty,

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:15.860
although harmful to people, is functional
for society, because it ensures there are always
people who want work.

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.900
So this view might see any attempts at alleviating
poverty as being potentially damaging to society.

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.820
It’s in areas like this, however, where
conflict theories shine.

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:33.660
In contrast to structural functionalism, conflict theories imagine society as being composed of different groups that struggle over scarce resources – like power, money, land, food, or status.

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:38.000
This view takes change as being fundamental
to society, constantly driven by these conflicts.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.640
The first conflict theory in sociology was
the theory of class conflict, advanced by Karl Marx.

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:49.600
This theory imagines society as having different
classes based on their relationships to the means of
production – things like factories and raw materials.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:58.140
Under capitalism, the two classes were the capitalists, or bourgeoisie, who own the means of production, and the workers, or proletariat, who must sell their labor to survive.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:03.940
Marx saw this conflict between classes as
the central conflict in society and the source
of social inequality in power and wealth.

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.860
But there are other conflict theories that
focus on different kinds of groups.

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:12.640
Race-Conflict theory, for example, was first
stated sociologically by W.E.B. DuBois, another
founder of sociology.

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:16.880
It understands social inequality as the result of
conflict between different racial and ethnic groups.

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:20.800
Gender-Conflict theory, meanwhile, focuses on
the social inequalities between women and men.

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:26.000
The perspective of all three kinds of conflict
theory have been crucially important in American
history and are still important today.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.460
But the paradigms we've looked at so far are
essentially macro approaches:

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:36.340
Structural functionalism focuses on how large
structures fit together, and conflict theory looks at how
society defines sources of inequality and conflict.

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:40.340
But then there’s symbolic interactionism,
and it’s built to deal with micro questions.

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:46.780
Symbolic interactionism first appeared most
clearly in the work of German sociologist Max Weber
and his focus on Verstehen, or "understanding."

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:52.380
Weber believed that sociology needed to
focus on people’s individual social situations and
the meaning that they attached to them.

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:58.460
So, because it’s more micro-focused, symbolic
interactionism understands society as the
product of everyday social interactions.

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:03.460
Specifically, this school of thought is interested
in understanding the shared reality that people
create through their interactions.

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:10.300
It might seem weird to say that reality can
be created, but think back to the idea of
raw facts versus interpretation.

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:16.700
Waving my my hand back and forth is a raw fact,
but it only means that I'm waving hello to you because
we’ve agreed to give it that meaning.

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:20.040
For symbolic interactionism, then, there is
no big-T truth.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:24.680
Instead, it looks at the world that we create when
we assign meaning to interactions and objects.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:27.620
A handshake is only a greeting because we
agree that it is.

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:30.880
A dog can be a friend or food, depending on
what meaning we've given it.

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:34.940
Obviously, these three different paradigms provide
radically different ways of looking at the social world.

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:37.320
But, this is because they all grasp at different
parts of it.

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:43.900
They each give us a different lens through we can see
our social lives, just like science sometimes needs a
microscope and sometimes needs a telescope.

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:49.140
All of these lenses are important and, yes,
necessary for the investigation of sociological
questions.

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:54.000
Today we discussed what theoretical paradigms
are, and talked more in depth about the macro/micro
distinction.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.340
Then we took a look at the three major
paradigms in sociology, and learned a bit about
their advantages and disadvantages.

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:04.180
Next week we're going to start learning how
these paradigms can be used to do actual
sociological research.

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:10.080
Crash Course Sociology is filmed in the Dr.
Cheryl C. Kinney Studio in Missoula, MT, and it's
