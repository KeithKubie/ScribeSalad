00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Aircraft carriers are pretty impressive ships. When a plane is taking off,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
it first needs to reach what we can call takeoff velocity.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
If the plane is going any slower than this velocity,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
it won't be able to generate enough lift to actually get off the ground.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Now an aircraft carrier's space is very limited.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So there's not a lot of time or distance to reach this velocity.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So these ships have catapults that actually accelerate the plane very rapidly.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
What I want to know is if you have a plane with a takeoff velocity of 250 km/hr

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
on an aircraft carrier whose length is 80 m, what is the minimum acceleration you need?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And keep in mind that's in m/s² and here we have km/hr.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
What's the minimum acceleration you'll need to prevent your plane from falling into the ocean?

00:00:40.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Keep in mind that this takeoff velocity is given in km/hr, but the answer should be in m/s².
