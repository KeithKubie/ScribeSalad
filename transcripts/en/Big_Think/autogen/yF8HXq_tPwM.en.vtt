we all when you play with magnets and

you feel the repulsive force that seems

strong but notice that it acts over a

very short distance it just nominally it

goes it's not perfect but you can
 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.500
goes it's not perfect but you can
estimate it by saying it goes off as the

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510
estimate it by saying it goes off as the
 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.080
estimate it by saying it goes off as the
cube of the distance so if you get if

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090
cube of the distance so if you get if
 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.790

like the way you think then you also

it up from has to be pushed from a place

so it becomes very difficult practically

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850
so it becomes very difficult practically

probably you probably couldn't do it but

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350
probably you probably couldn't do it but
 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.740
probably you probably couldn't do it but
that's very creative that was cool

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750
that's very creative that was cool
