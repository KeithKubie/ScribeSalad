00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.910
Dead arms, dead legs, dead feet!

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:04.850
DEATH IS EVERYWHERE.

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.440
WHAT IS GOING ON?

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.730
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.020
Hey everyone!

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.570
Laci Green here for DNews.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.449
You wake up in the morning sleeping on your
arm, and as you go to move: nothin.

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:17.449
Complete deadness.

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:22.210
A dead arm can be such a strange experience
- like you no longer have any control over

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.210
it.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.899
I can pick it up with my other hand and wave
it around, which feels tingly and brings the

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:28.490
sensation back slowly.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.499
Sometimes there's even this brief prickly
burning that actually hurts.

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:35.350
I distinctly remember the first time this
happened to me when I was 10 or 11.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.370
For a moment I thought something was seriously
wrong with me.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.990
Like, OH MY GOD I BROKE MY HAND!

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:42.300
But, HERE I AM.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.780
Still alive with hands in tact.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.949
Turns out, dead arms, feet, legs, and other
limbs are a very common occurrence AND it's

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:49.940
pretty interesting why it happens.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.260
In order to have control of your limbs, your
brain needs to be able to communicate through

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.929
your nerve pathways to say "MOVE ARM!"

00:00:55.929 --> 00:00:56.949
"WALK, LEG!".

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:00.850
Those nerve pathways also carry sensation
information back to your brain that tell you

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.589
how something feels or that it's moving.

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:06.670
BUT, when any sort of pressure is applied
to a part of your body for awhile, it squeezes

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.560
those nerve pathways and the electrochemical
impulses can't transmit and tell the body

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.560
part what to do.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.750
It's a common misunderstanding that you get
a dead limb because blood flow stops - but

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.720
if that were true, you could say byebye to
your hand and criss-cross-applesauce? - would

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.110
be a deadly undertaking.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.450
What actually happens with the pressure on
the arteries is that it cuts off the nutrient

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.469
supply to your NERVE CELLS, making them get
all weird.

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:32.189
The cells might stop transmitting information,
they might start freaking out and sending

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.039
impulses ALL OVER THE PLACE.

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:37.920
Those erratic impulses are actually why it
feels like pins and needles, the official

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.090
name of which is "paresthesia".

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.740
This is what happens when you hit your funny
bone -- or the Ulnar nerve running along your

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.100
elbow -- as well.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.710
Cell freakout from the pressure.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.200
As you shake out your dead limb, the nerves
slowly re-establish themselves, and it can

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.430
take a sec for the impulses to go back to
normal.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:52.680
Or sometimes....more then a sec.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.640
I've had it last a minute or two before.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.939
Having your nerves misfire while there's some
pressure on them isn't a huge deal.....unless

00:01:58.939 --> 00:01:59.939
it goes on for a long time.

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.549
It's actually pretty handy that a lot of the
time a limb will start to tingle first - it's

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:07.340
your body trying to alert you before you do
some serious damage.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.690
With prolonged pressure, the nerves could
stop transmitting feeling all together.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:11.690
SO!

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:12.690
There you have it.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.941
Now go to a swing at your friend's funny bone
and give them a science lesson.

00:02:14.941 --> 00:02:15.941
Or don't actually.

00:02:15.941 --> 00:02:16.941
That's kind of evil.

00:02:16.941 --> 00:02:20.690
Thanks for watching DNews folks, we'll be
back soon with more science updates!
