JONATHAN GLASSMAN:
First and foremost,

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.760
would be my parents, my
dad who always reminded me

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.370
how to take things cool, you
know, work first, panic later.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.010

parents, my family--

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.260

been so incredibly supportive

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.410
VIVIEN CHENG: My
parents, my grandparents

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.920
for believing in
me and for being

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.000
people that like I can
believe in and be inspired by.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.350
CHRISTIAN SAHNER: My
family, who have tolerated

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.090
many, many years of
esoteric conversation

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:38.200
at the dining room table.


00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.950
ALLISON METTS: My
sister, Elizabeth Metts,

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.340
thank you for showing me that
graduating from Princeton

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.900
is possible, that
writing a thesis

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.680
is possible, that having a
life while writing a thesis

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.270
is possible.


00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.200
CALEB BRADFORD: My dad,
first and foremost,

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.050

BENJAMIN HAZEL: My
brother, especially.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.400
I want to thank my teammates for
being there through everything.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.380
GAVIN COOK: My family.


00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.420
They've given me gifts
of such great magnitude

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.100
and I'm only beginning
to understand exactly how

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.060
wonderful they are now.


00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.660
ISABELLE NOGUES: All
of my professors,

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.070
advisers, college deans,
residential advisers--

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.170
BENJAMIN HAZEL: Grandma--


00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.630
VIVIEN CHENG: You know, all my
teachers from before college,

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.140
because they're who
shaped me into someone who

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.170
could be accepted by Princeton.


00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.370
SARAH ISLAM: My husband as
well, who has been so patient.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.550
Graduate school is a--
anyone in graduate school,

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.090
anyone who is in
graduate school will

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.630
be able to tell you that it is
a totally different ballgame.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.030
It is not just a full-time job.


00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.680
It's like three full-time jobs.


00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.300
JONATHAN GLASSMAN:
My mom who, you know,

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.990
really inspired me to keep
fighting through the mess.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.480
My brother, also a PhD student,
huge inspiration, and my sister

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.000
as well.


00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.520
JOAN CANNON: I want
to thank my peers

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.260
for both encouraging
and challenging me

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.690
in my academics and
extracurricular activities.

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.570
BENJAMIN HAZEL: I want
to give a special thanks

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.650
to Rachel Ferguson for

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.000
did in my thesis process.


00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.950
GAVIN COOK: I want to thank
the entire East Asian Studies

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:56.450
department.


00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.700
It was a blast being
a major and I can't

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.890
recommend it highly enough.


00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.830
CALEB BRADFORD: My high school
college and career counselor

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:02.680
Mrs. Roberts.


00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.100
VIVIEN CHENG: The
Admissions office

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.310
because I don't know who
was reading my applications,

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.750
but they made the decision


00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.990
and they give me the opportunity
to come to a university

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.720
like this.


00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.850
CHRISTIAN SAHNER: My advisers,
Professor Peter Brown

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.040

in the Department of
Near Eastern Studies, who

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.740
have been wonderful mentors and
examples of intellectual life

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:22.240
for me.


00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.280
ISABELLE NOGUES: Mentor
Doctor Christine Taylor,

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.440
who has guided me through
numerous processes

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.370
in my upperclassmen
years in math.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.110
JONATHAN GLASSMAN: My
undergraduate research adviser

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.250
Professor Maria Feng,
who if it wasn't for her

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.540
I wouldn't have even considered
going to grad school.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.250
CALEB BRADFORD: For my
seventh grade language arts

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.960
teacher, Mrs. Carlson.


00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.860

adviser, Professor Cook.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:42.900
GAVIN COOK: I want
to thank my friends

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.780
on campus for their
inspiration and support.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.970
And a friend of mine
from high school

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.360
whose name is Brendan Kutler.


00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.320
He's since passed away and he's
taught me so much in his life

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.130
and in his passing.


00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.270
VIVIEN CHENG: My professors,
my advisers, the staff,

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.730
the admins of the
Music Department.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.830
BENJAMIN HAZEL: I also want
to thank my other thesis

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.000
adviser Professor Lawrence.


00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.250
VIVIEN CHENG: --the
Wilson College office--

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.620
JONATHAN GLASSMAN: In addition
to the many grad students

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.170
along the way and
the undergraduates

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.400
that I have advised
who got me through some

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.030
of the rough moments,
and also made

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.410
sure I enjoyed the fun moments.


00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.060
Last, but not
least, is definitely

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.000
my own adviser,
Professor Maria Garlock,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.990
who inspires me not only as an
academic and as an engineer,

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.780
but actually how to
be a better person.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.320
CALEB BRADFORD: I have to thank
all the professors and students

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.210
in MAE.


00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.120
It's certainly been a team
effort getting to graduation.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.790
And I've had an extraordinary
experience building projects,

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.580
also building friendships
in the process.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.930
VIVIEN CHENG: --the Neuroscience
Department, and also OIP,

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.850
the Office of International--
like the Study Abroad Programs.

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.530
CHRISTIAN SAHNER: For
me the unsung heroes

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.370
of Princeton's campus
are its chaplains.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.570
And I profited tremendously
from the wonderful priests

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.530
of the Aquinas Institute,
Princeton's Roman

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.070
Catholic chaplaincy,
who have supported me

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.110
through many years of tough
work of all the challenges

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.890
that this wonderful
place throws at you.

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.020
VIVIEN CHENG: --the
private music teachers

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.930
that I studied with.


00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.570
GAVIN COOK: I want to
thank Professor David

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:07.840
Leheny, my thesis adviser.


00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.310
CALEB BRADFORD: Thanks go to my
loving friends and family who

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.350
through the good and the bad,
successes and failures,

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.530
never fail to keep
my ego in check

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.790
and help pick me up
when I need it most.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.300
CHRISTIAN SAHNER: I feel like
this is a family victory -- not

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.410
my achievement, but
really it belongs

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.770
to my mother, my father,
my brother, and my sister.

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.120
