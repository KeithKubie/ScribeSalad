00:00:01.367 --> 00:00:04.704
There's a crazy situation
going on in Oakland right now,

00:00:04.737 --> 00:00:07.006
and for once,
it's not Raiders fans.

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:09.976
There is no acting police chief
in Oakland right now.

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:13.046
Instead, the department
is under civilian control.

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:16.783
-(laughter, groaning)
-Civilian control?

00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:19.118
You really want
to do that, Oakland?

00:00:19.151 --> 00:00:22.321
-Have you met civilians?
-(laughter)

00:00:22.354 --> 00:00:24.690
They're the whole reason
we have police!

00:00:24.723 --> 00:00:26.159
(laughter)

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:28.227
All right, so Oakland
finds itself in this situation

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.864
after losing three chiefs
in nine days,

00:00:31.897 --> 00:00:34.901
all in the wake
of some shocking scandals.

00:00:34.934 --> 00:00:37.470
WOMAN:<i> Things first began
 to unravel in September</i>

00:00:37.503 --> 00:00:40.673
<i>after an officer killed himself
 and left a suicide note</i>

00:00:40.706 --> 00:00:43.309
<i> claiming several officers
 were having sex</i>

00:00:43.342 --> 00:00:45.011
<i> with a teenage prostitute.</i>

00:00:45.044 --> 00:00:46.512
Um, sorry.

00:00:46.545 --> 00:00:48.081
Um, the aftermath

00:00:48.114 --> 00:00:50.917
of a sex prostitution-cop
suicide

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.585
is when things<i> started </i>
to unravel?

00:00:52.618 --> 00:00:54.554
(laughter)

00:00:56.088 --> 00:00:59.792
If 14 cops are having sex with
the same underage prostitute,

00:00:59.825 --> 00:01:02.161
I really don't think your
department is "raveled.”

00:01:02.194 --> 00:01:04.030
-(laughter)
-Mm.

00:01:04.063 --> 00:01:06.632
Well, maybe the bright side is
that we're talking about cops,

00:01:06.665 --> 00:01:08.267
and there's no racism involved.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.503
In addition
to the sex abuse claims,

00:01:10.536 --> 00:01:12.305
there's also a separate
investigation

00:01:12.338 --> 00:01:16.042
into racist text messages
that were sent between officers.

00:01:16.075 --> 00:01:17.577
Yes! I mean, what?!

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.412
(laughter)

00:01:19.445 --> 00:01:22.048
Honestly, I mean,
with all this going on,

00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:24.083
it's no wonder
they keep losing police chiefs.

00:01:24.116 --> 00:01:26.319
Now, for more, we turn to
Oakland's newest police chief,

00:01:26.352 --> 00:01:28.321
Officer Bob Miller.

00:01:28.354 --> 00:01:31.624
(cheers and applause)

00:01:31.657 --> 00:01:34.494
Now, Officer Miller,
with this sex scandal

00:01:34.527 --> 00:01:36.963
and allegations
of racist text messages,

00:01:36.996 --> 00:01:39.398
do you think you'll ever be able
to regain the community's trust?

00:01:39.431 --> 00:01:41.167 line:0%
Yes, Larry.
Now that I'm in charge,

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.536 line:0%
we're going to conduct
internal investigations

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:45.505 line:0%
to ensure
this never happens again.

00:01:45.538 --> 00:01:47.540
Well, that's good,

00:01:47.573 --> 00:01:49.375
but 14 officers
were allegedly involved,

00:01:49.408 --> 00:01:52.645
so what exactly are you doing to
root out this culture of abuse?

00:01:52.678 --> 00:01:54.347
That's a good question, Larry.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.249
That's why
I've got all my officers

00:01:56.282 --> 00:01:58.251
just watching porn all day.
That's what they do.

00:01:58.284 --> 00:02:00.820
(laughter)

00:02:00.853 --> 00:02:03.022
Wait. Watching porn all day?

00:02:03.055 --> 00:02:05.358 line:0%
Now I know it's a little
controversial, but it works.

00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:07.260 line:0%
That way,
when they're out in the field,

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:10.229 line:0%
their guns will be loaded
but their tanks will be empty,

00:02:10.262 --> 00:02:11.797 line:0%
if you know what I mean.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.333 line:0%
-I'm talking about ejaculating.
-Yeah, I know what you mean.

00:02:14.366 --> 00:02:15.568
-(laughter)
-I know.

00:02:15.601 --> 00:02:16.869
I knew exactly what you meant.

00:02:16.902 --> 00:02:18.871
And I don't know
why you had to say that.

00:02:18.904 --> 00:02:20.773
How did you even get this job?

00:02:20.806 --> 00:02:23.042
We were just asking
the same thing, Larry.

00:02:23.075 --> 00:02:24.577
(laughter)

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.679
Wait a second.
Um, who are you?

00:02:26.712 --> 00:02:29.849 line:0%
I'm the new, new police chief,
Officer Johnson!

00:02:29.882 --> 00:02:31.150 line:0%
That's right.

00:02:31.183 --> 00:02:33.219 line:0%
Officer miller was just caught
with a group

00:02:33.252 --> 00:02:35.755 line:0%
of teenage prostitutes,
so he had to go.

00:02:35.788 --> 00:02:37.156
Wait. Just now?

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:38.991
You mean in the middle
of the interview?

00:02:39.024 --> 00:02:41.594
-Yeah. Hey, man, things go down
quick in Oakland. -(laughter)

00:02:41.627 --> 00:02:44.263
Oh, you know, speaking of which,
just a second.

00:02:44.296 --> 00:02:46.732 line:0%
I solemnly swear to blah,
blah, blah, blah. And done!

00:02:46.765 --> 00:02:48.935
(laughter)

00:02:48.968 --> 00:02:51.037
And done? That's an oath?

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.105
Okay, okay, so now,

00:02:53.138 --> 00:02:55.441
you're the new,<i> new</i> police
chief, I guess.

00:02:55.474 --> 00:02:57.143
Officer Johnson--
is that right?

00:02:57.176 --> 00:02:59.278 line:0%
Uh, no, no, no. Uh,
Officer Johnson's been gone

00:02:59.311 --> 00:03:01.547 line:0%
for at least... (sputtering)
five seconds.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.050 line:0%
-(laughter)
-I'm Officer Wilson,

00:03:04.083 --> 00:03:06.252 line:0%
the new, new, new police chief,

00:03:06.285 --> 00:03:07.653 line:0%
and I am here to stay.

00:03:07.686 --> 00:03:11.023
Uh, what did Officer Johnson do?

00:03:11.056 --> 00:03:12.458 line:0%
What<i> didn't</i> she do?

00:03:12.491 --> 00:03:15.127 line:0%
More specifically,
<i> who</i> didn't she do? Am I right?

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.529 line:0%
Yeah. Up top. Yeah.

00:03:16.562 --> 00:03:18.998
-Okay. Yeah.
-That is not funny.

00:03:19.031 --> 00:03:22.034
Maybe not, but the text
I just sent you sure is.

00:03:22.067 --> 00:03:24.770
-(phone chimes)
-Oh. Okay.

00:03:24.803 --> 00:03:27.106
-Um... Oh, upside down.
-Yeah.

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:29.242
"How do you stop
an Oakland police chief

00:03:29.275 --> 00:03:30.910
from having sex
with teenaged girls?"

00:03:30.943 --> 00:03:32.445
Ugh! I don't know.

00:03:32.478 --> 00:03:34.947
(laughs)
Neither do I! Yeah!

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.416
-(laughter)
-And I resign.

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:39.952
-Dab. Awesome.
-(laughter)

00:03:39.985 --> 00:03:41.554
-You're dabbing out?
-(applause and cheering)

00:03:41.587 --> 00:03:43.256
Why did you just dab?

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:46.459
Wait. Now there's no Oakland
police chief at all.

00:03:46.492 --> 00:03:48.127
Oh, actually,
that's not true, Larry.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.762
Police chief's right here.
How you doing?

00:03:49.795 --> 00:03:51.631
Wait. You're back?
You were just fired, right?

00:03:51.664 --> 00:03:54.533
Yeah, it's good news.
I got off on a technicality.

00:03:54.566 --> 00:03:58.571
They could not prove it was me,
even though it totally was.

00:03:58.604 --> 00:04:01.040
-(laughter) -Okay, now,
you just admitted it, though.

00:04:01.073 --> 00:04:03.175
Oh, damn it. Well, looks like
I got to resign.

00:04:03.208 --> 00:04:05.645
-It's been a good run.
Thank you. -Wait.

00:04:05.678 --> 00:04:07.513
This was not helpful at all.

00:04:07.546 --> 00:04:09.448
The Oakland police chiefs,
everyone.

00:04:09.481 --> 00:04:11.481
-(applause and cheering)
-Yeah.
