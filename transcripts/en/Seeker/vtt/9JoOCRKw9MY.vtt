00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.540
How Powerful is China...’s Space Program?...

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:10.430
I watch a lot of Seeker Daily.

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.130
Greetings friends from around the world, Julian
here for DNews.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.700
Now, I’m not at liberty to tell you exactly
where the DNews bunker is but suffice it to

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.120
say that it’s in the United States.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.210
As such that tends to influence what we talk
about, like most of our space stories usually

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.730
focus on what the US Space Agency NASA is
up to.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.940
But NASA is far from the only space program
out there, so we thought we’d make a series

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.810
of episodes exploring and appreciating the
efforts of other countries, and first up is

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:37.810
China.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.710
China’s national space administration is
called the….

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.310
China National Space Administration, or CNSA
for short.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.940
Founded in 1993, it’s a relatively new player
on the space scene, but it’s grown by great

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.170
leaps and bounds since its inception.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.610
China is only the third country to independently
send astronauts into space, after Russia and

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:56.810
the United States.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.770
So far they’ve sent 10 up there, and even
put there own space station into orbit in

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.160
2011, the Tiangong-1.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.679
I’m sure I’m not pronouncing that right;
if you speak Mandarin, please bear with me.

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:11.340
Tiangong-1 served as a space lab and a way
to test docking capabilities.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.500
Two manned crews visited the space station,
but since 2013 it’s been all by its lonesome.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.159
In March of 2016 it stopped sending data back
to earth, and in September, CNSA announced

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:24.890
it would come down some time in the second
half of 2017.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.899
This vague time frame has lead some to conclude
that China has no control over the descent

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:34.009
of Tiangong-1, and while most of it will probably
burn up upon reentry, some of the denser parts,

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.610
like rocket engines, could make it through.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.149
What with the earth being mostly covered in
water, it’s probably going to land in an

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:44.909
ocean, but just in case, maybe keep one eye
on the sky starting June 2017.

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.639
Still, CNSA insists that the space station
was only designed to last 2 years, so making

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:52.149
it to 2017 is a huge success.

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:57.130
The same month they sort-of announced Tiangong-1
was just going to do it’s own thing, CNSA

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.380
successfully launched Tiangong-2.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.159
Their second space station has improved living
quarters and life support, and the first manned

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.679
mission to it is scheduled to last 30 days,
while the longest one to Tiangong-1 was just

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:08.679
12 days.

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.690
China’s goal is to have it’s own large
space station by the early 2020s.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.940
You may be wondering why they don’t shack
up with the rest of the world’s astronauts

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.390
aboard the ISS.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.530
Unfortunately some borders in space are still
defined by the ones down on Earth.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:27.480
In 2011 US legislators banned NASA from collaborating
with the CNSA, citing fears of espionage.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.260
With NASA’s hands tied and the ISS locking
the doors, China has had to go it alone, and

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.850
has responded magnificently.

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.250
China’s not solely focused on putting men
and women into orbit; they’ve also launched

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.069
scientific satellites to study space weather
and look for dark matter.

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.530
More satellites are planned to look for black
holes and study solar wind.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.099
China has been collaborating with the European
Space Agency on some of these satellites since

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:54.960
2003 in an effort to build international relations.They’ve
also sent their own probes, a telescope, and

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.349
a rover to the moon, and plan to send the
first ever rover to the far side of the moon.

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:03.090
First, though, they’ll have to set up a
communications satellite at a lagrange point

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.819
so the rover can still talk to Earth.

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.659
They aren’t going to stop at the moon though,
and have announced a plan to probe and rove

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:10.609
Mars by the 2020s.

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:14.930
CNSA may be a comparatively young space program,
but they are ambitious and their achievements

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.829
so far are impressive.

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:21.159
China is considering using their space program
to mine the moon for nuclear fuel.

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:22.159
How you ask?

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:35.599
I answer 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:38.090
that here.

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.099
We want to do a whole series on space programs
from around the world.

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:42.799
What’s the next one you think we should
cover?

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:44.859
