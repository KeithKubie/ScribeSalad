00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.363
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:06.380


00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:07.960
&gt;&gt; Hello everyone.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:09.760
Good afternoon.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.626
I'd like to ask you to take a
seat please so that we can go

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.626
on to our next presentation.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.026
So how is everyone?

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.103
Good, good, good.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.283
I've been asked to take
care of one little piece

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.193
of housekeeping before we begin.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.113
The presentations in the pavilion
are being filmed for the Library

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.553
of Congress website and
for their activities.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:39.183
That young man, that handsome young
man that's sitting back there,

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.716
he's going to wave.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.183
And he's going to appreciate
that you be mindful of that,

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.650
not bump into the risers etcetera

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.420
so he can get the best
filming possible.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.746
So with that said, hello everyone.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.586
My name is Laurie Montenaro.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.516
I work Telemundo Network
here in Washington,

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.976
D.C. and could have we
have asked for a better day

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.486
for the National Book Festival.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.553
After all that rain the past
years I think this is a great day.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.810
I am certainly very,
very excited [Speaking

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.720
in a foreign language] I am
also very honored [Speaking

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.376
in a foreign language] to be here
today to present our guest author,

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.470
poet and journalist,
Margarita Engle.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:27.993
However, I have a little secret.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:30.193
There's another reason I'm excited,

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.726
because as Margarita,
I am of Cuban descent.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.210
Not from Havana though, I'm from
Oriente, but its Cuba and her love

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.850
for books began when she
was very, very young.

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:45.083
She started to read
when she was young.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.483
She started to write
since she was very young

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:50.156
and I think we are all
blessed with the fact

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.670
that she is sharing
her gift with us.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.223
She has a way with words and
you all know what I mean.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.680
But I have to say from someone who's

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.966
from the Caribbean we do
have a way with words.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.020
Some of us we [Sound
effects] as you all know.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.866
But seriously she does have
this wonderful gift of prose

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.706
and this has earned
her many, many words.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.386
For example for two years now she
has won the Pura Belpret Award.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.886
It also marks the very, very
first time that a Hispanic,

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.520
[Speaking in a foreign
language] author has received

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.386
such a distinction.

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.483
I love the fact that
she says [Applause] Yes.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.446
I love the fact that she says, "I
want to write for young people,

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.680
not just children but teenagers
because they are the future."

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.616
I know how many distractions
they have in their lives

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.476
and it's a privilege when
they actually listen to a poem

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.143
and ask amazingly intelligent
questions and they think

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.390
about things and are aware of the
world and their surroundings."

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:06.310
On critic said, "She gracefully
packs a lot of information

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.516
into a spare and elegant narrative

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.316
that will make the historical moment
be as describing and accessible

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.276
to a wide range of readers."

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.833
Another said, "Engle's prose
breeds life into each character

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.190
and her rich use of
language catapults the reader

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:27.696
into each setting."

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:29.080
This is her first time at
the National Book Festival

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.913
and we hope Margarita
it is not your last.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.350
Can I ask all of you
to please stand up?

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.316
Please let's stand
up and welcome her.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.400


00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.196
Give her a warm [Speaking in a
foreign language] Margarita Engel.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:51.930
[Applause]

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:53.396
&gt;&gt; Margarita Engel:
Thank you so much.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.130
Thank you Laurie for that
beautiful introduction.

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.663
Writing is an exploration.

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.903
No matter what I set out
to write I always discover

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.863
that I have explored some aspect

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.406
of freedom whether social,
emotional or spiritual.

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.103
I wrote my most recent novel
and verse, The Firefly Letters,

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:20.716
because I felt such deep
admiration for Fredrika Bremer,

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.920
a woman who is far
ahead of her time.

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.136
A courageous Swedish
women's rights advocate

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.096
who visited my ancestral
homeland of Cuba in 1851,

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.233
at a time when women simply
did not travel alone; courage

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.020
and compassion are stories that
remain relevant for all of us

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.906
at any age and in any
historical context.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.630
With the help of Cecilia,
a young pregnant,

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.860
enslaved African born translator
Fredrika Bremer wandered all

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.376
over the countryside interviewing
slaves and freed slaves as well

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.840
as poor whites from
Spain and from Cuba.

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:15.606
Her diaries and letters provide
the most complete known record

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.156
of daily life on the
island at that time.

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.763
While researching this
story I became fascinated

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.300
by the relationship between
Fredrika and Cecilia.

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.820
I wondered how they might
have influenced each other

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.760
and I also imagined Elena,
a fictional upper class girl

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.296
who chaperoned life was restricted

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.836
to the indoor world
of silks and lace.

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.953
And whose future offered
nothing beyond a forced marriage

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.486
to a wealthy stranger.

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:58.290
Could three young women from
such different backgrounds

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.520
become friends?

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.423
For me, one of the
most intriguing aspects

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.513
of Fredrika Bremers
diary was the image

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:11.016
of three young women roaming
the countryside buying freedom

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.333
for fireflies that had
been captured by children

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.416
who used them as playthings.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:25.140
From that point on the story
became one about changing the world

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:30.660
by making hopeful choices in
situations that seemed hopeless.

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:37.216
Because they would buy freedom
from fireflies, turn them loose

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:39.680
and then the children would capture
them again and then they'd have

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.386
to buy their freedom again,
and yet they didn't give up.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:50.726
They kept doing this and it became
a metaphor for me of the struggle

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.560
for freedom within
their human world.

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:01.390
My connection to the
history of Cuba is personal.

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:04.776
My American father
traveled to the island

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:08.056
after seeing National
Geographic pictures

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:12.863
of my Cuban mother's hometown of
Trinidad on the south central coast.

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:17.470
And even though they did
no speak the same language,

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:20.070
they fell in love at first sight.

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:24.353
And since they are both artists
who have now been married

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:27.726
for 62 years [Applause]
they communicated

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:34.743
by passing sketches back and forth.

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:37.806
Young people will get in trouble
if they repeat this in class.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.573
But it worked for my parents.

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:44.133
They were soon married and
although I was born and raised

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:51.060
in my father's hometown of Los
Angeles, California we spent summers

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:56.010
in Cuba where I developed a deep
bond with my extended family

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:01.366
and I also developed a lifelong
passion for tropical nature

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:05.473
and for the mysteries
to the islands past.

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:10.750
During one of our summers to
Cuba, diplomatic relations

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:14.160
between the island and
the U.S. broken down

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:18.590
and after the 1962 missile
crisis travel was forbidden.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:25.433
So even though my experience was
not that of a Cuban born refugee,

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:30.300
I felt as if I had inherited
a surrealistic form of exile.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.680
Life seemed like science fiction.

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:42.050
One day I had a huge extended family
and the next day they were as far

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:46.210
out of reach as if they
were on a distant planet.

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:49.976
I wondered about the
lives of my cousins.

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:54.406
I wondered what my life would
have been like if we had settled

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:58.086
in my mother's homeland
instead of my father's.

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:03.256
And even today after returning to
the island many times as an adult,

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:07.463
I still feel a profound
sense of wonder

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:09.830
about the strangeness of life.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:14.373
That is why I choose
poetry as a suitable vessel

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:18.580
for the complex riddles of
history and the depths of emotion.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.826
It is also why I choose
to write for young readers

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:27.220
who are constantly faced

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:30.886
with troubling situations
and difficult decisions.

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:36.116
I hope that the courage and
kindness of young women I wrote

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:40.080
about in the Firefly Letters
and of Rosa la Bayamesa

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:44.876
and The Surrender Tree and Juan
Francisco Manzano and the Poet Slave

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:48.540
of Cuba and of the people
in Tropical Secrets.

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:50.780
I hope that all of these
characters will serve

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:56.226
as an inspiration during modern
times as young people struggle

00:09:56.890 --> 00:10:01.690
to make their own hopeful choices in
situations that might seem hopeless.

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:07.723
My other novels and verse for
young adults are also tributes

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.720
to this same spirit of
courage and compassion.

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:13.680
The Poet Slave of Cuba
tells the true story

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:20.046
of Juan Francisco Manzano, a child
who taught himself how to read

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:25.513
and became a great poet despite the
obstacles of slavery and cruelty.

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:31.180
The Surrender Tree is about Rosa
la Bayamesa, a wilderness nurse

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:35.903
who healed soldiers from both
sides during Cuba's three wars

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:38.806
for independence from Spain.

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:42.093
And then when the United
States charged

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:43.753
into the battle during the final
years which are known in the U.S.

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:51.706
as the Spanish-American war although
they are still known in Cuba

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:54.713
as the third war for
independence from Spain,

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:58.213
Rosa la Bayamesa healed
American soldiers.

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:00.683
She hid in caves.

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:03.286
She hid in jungles.

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:07.873
She used wild plants so again
in a situation that most

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:13.566
of us would have seen as
hopeless and we'd say,

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:14.426
"Oh I wish I could help these
wounded soldiers or these people

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:19.700
who are ill or suffering
from malaria

00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:23.610
or yellow fever, you
now what can I do?"

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:26.870
Well she figured out
something to do.

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.666
She experimented with wild plants.

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:33.153
She learned how to use
what she had available

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:38.336
and her story is especially
amazing because in Cuba it says

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:46.730
if you combined the war for
independence or revolutionary war

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:52.796
with the civil war, because the
struggle for independence from Spain

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:56.570
and the struggle for freedom
from slavery coincided.

00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:59.816
They happened at the same time.

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:05.236
In October of 1868 planters freed
their slaves and went to war

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:12.973
against Spain, declared
independence and fought side by side

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:17.266
with former slaves for
independence from Spain.

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:19.583
Rosa la Bayamesa received
her freedom at that time.

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:26.990
But instead of going off to the
city to enjoy her newfound freedom,

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:31.783
she stayed and made the
decision to help others.

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:34.926
And this is just so amazing to me.

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:39.580
I can't imagine that kind
of courage and compassion.

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:41.330
And so that's why I wanted to
write about these types of people,

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:48.283
her and Fredrika Bremer
and Juan Francisco Manzano.

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:51.023
I write about people that I admire.

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:55.793
And truly I have to say their
stories haunt me until I write

00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:01.703
about them and then they
continue to haunt me afterwards.

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:04.390
I just find the profoundly
inspiring.

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:11.893
My third young adult novel and verse
is called Tropical Secrets and it's

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:15.093
about Holocaust refugees
who found a safe harbor

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:19.303
in Havana receiving the
kindness of strangers

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:24.070
when Cuban teenagers
volunteered to teach them Spanish.

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:32.256
Again, the kind of courage and
compassion involved in a situation

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:36.883
like that is hard to
imagine and yet that one is

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:39.386
so much more recent in history.

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.466
And these things that
seem so impossible,

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:50.146
how could such a thing
have occurred have occurred

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:53.250
within the memories
of living people.

00:13:55.680 --> 00:14:00.346
And so I felt like I really wanted
to honor the actions that were taken

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:07.956
in places where Holocaust
refugees did receive the kindness

00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:11.210
of strangers in a safe harbor.

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:15.810
What happened is the ships that left
Germany in the late 1930's filled

00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:21.580
with German-Jewish refugees
were turned away from New York

00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:27.490
and Toronto and then they
turned southward and anchored

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:33.013
in Havana harbor until most of
the refugees did receive asylum.

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:37.073
I think that the contribution

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:43.033
of several Latin American
countries during that period

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:44.083
of time is extremely complex because
I don't want to sugar coat it

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:47.916
and make it sound like
everybody welcomed them.

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:55.130
There were tragedies and there
was trauma and there was trickery

00:14:56.690 --> 00:15:00.823
but most of the refugees did
actually become Cuban and I wanted

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:06.736
to write about the adjustment
that it was for them to think

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:12.583
that they were headed for New
York and were going to have

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:17.263
to learn English and then
end up in the tropics having

00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:21.776
to learn Spanish and become Cuban.

00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:26.450
In March of 2011 my next novel
and verse will be released.

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:33.536
It's called Hurricane Dancers: The
First Caribbean Pirate Shipwreck.

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:39.216
It's set in 1509 a much more
difficult time period to research

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.546
because so little was
written that long ago.

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:50.390
And that which was written was only
written from one point of view,

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:56.510
from the Spanish point of view
since they had the written language.

00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:00.346
This book is about
the dramatic encounter

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:05.070
between peaceful Cuban Indians

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:09.536
on the south central coast just a
few years later became my mother's

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:14.316
hometown and the first Caribbean
pirate who was shipwrecked along

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:19.020
with his hostage, a
brutal conquistador.

00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:21.450


00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:27.216
During the course of the research
of this book I became a subject

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:32.200
of the Cuban DNA project
verifying what I had always

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:36.510
instinctively suspected.

00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:40.523
My maternal DNA is Native American.

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:45.900
For five centuries almost
all history books have stated

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:52.596
with absolute certainty that
all Cuban Indians are extinct.

00:16:55.890 --> 00:17:00.223
But the history books were wrong
and DNA studies are proving this.

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:03.736
Maternal DNA studies in particular

00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:07.230
because women did survive
the near genocide

00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:11.576
of the 1511 conquest
of Cuba by Spain.

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:18.030
So I wanted to write about Taino
and Siboney Indians and also

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:23.683
about the mixed race children

00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:29.650
because 1509 there
were already children

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:34.576
who were half Spanish
and half Indian.

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:41.560
And the Spaniards -- Africans
were not the first slaves in Cuba.

00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:48.006
The Spaniards enslaved the Cuban
Indians during those early years

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:55.090
and the mixed raced children
were known as "broken" children.

00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:01.580
So I really wanted to write about
those survivors who did manage

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:09.553
in body as well as spirit
to overcome incredible odds.

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:16.583
Now when I research a historical
topic I try to read everything

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:21.340
that I can get my hands
on with fresh eyes,

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:26.493
asking myself whether the people
telling a story really understood

00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:30.823
their subject or were they
merely repeating rumors.

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:33.123
In order to be sure that I've
researched thoroughly I use

00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:40.063
interlibrary loan, borrowing
diaries and other older references

00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:44.250
that are not always available
completely online yet.

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:48.173
I search especially for
first person accounts

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:52.083
because they contain
the emotional aspects

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:56.953
of daily life answering the question
what did it feel like at that time.

00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:04.843
Once the research is complete
the process of writing begins.

00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:10.316
And while research is painstaking
and meticulous poetry is expansive

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:14.320
and imaginative and my hope is

00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:19.123
that the two moods will blend
offering a glimpse into the lives

00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:22.483
of people who lived long ago.

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:28.140
When I write a novel and verse
I feel as if wilderness is one

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:36.513
of my characters, forests,
animals and this Cuban weather

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:43.013
that we have here today are powerful
forces in my stories and that is

00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:48.396
because I studied agriculture and
botany along with creative writing

00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:53.236
and I did that because I loved my
ancestors farm in Cuba so much.

00:19:57.770 --> 00:20:01.636
It was a farm that I visited
during those childhood summers

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:07.263
and it has essentially become
part of my imaginary world,

00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:14.836
sort of a magical world that I
enter whenever I write about Cuba.

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:19.440
I do have on picture
book for younger children

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:25.940
and another one coming
out in another year or so.

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:27.573
The one that's available
now is called Summer Birds

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:33.586
and its subtitled The
Butterflies of Maria Merian.

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:39.140
Maria Sibylla Merian and my
interest in her comes from my botany

00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:41.156
and agriculture training.

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:44.043
She was a woman who
lived in the 1600's

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:52.613
and became an amazing illustrator,
scientist and explorer again

00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:55.080
at a time when women
just did not travel alone

00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:01.700
and she studied butterfly
lifecycles and proved the dystheory

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:05.460
of spontaneous generation
long before any of the men

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:07.823
who got credit for that work.

00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:12.290
And my next picture book is about
wilderness search and rescue dogs

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:16.946
because in my real life in my
spare time my husband trains search

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:19.193
and rescue dogs to find lost hikers
in the Sahara Nevada Mountains

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:24.426
in California and I'm
a volunteer victim.

00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:29.323
I hid in the forest so that the
dogs can practice finding someone.

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:32.136
[Laughter] Much of my writing is
actually done during those quiet

00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:35.550
hours when I wait to be found.

00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:37.550


00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:38.393
[Laughter] And thank you
so much for your attention

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:43.093
and I would be happy to
answer any questions.

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:46.730
This has been a wonderful
experience.

00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:48.330


00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:53.680
[Applause] Yes.

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:54.946
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible background question]

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:58.680
&gt;&gt; Margarita Engle: Thank you.

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:02.480
Please come to the microphone
when you do have a question.

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:05.730


00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:09.610
&gt;&gt; It's a great book.

00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:13.663
I got a copy for me
and my niece you know.

00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:15.780
&gt;&gt; Margarita Engle: Thank you.

00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:17.016
&gt;&gt; But I wanted to ask you, did you
study any other books sort of --

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:23.543
I could tell it was sort of new leaf
for you when you went into that.

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:26.840
&gt;&gt; Margarita Engle: Thank you.

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:28.240
You know that's actually a
very interesting question

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:32.640
because I started to write
Summer Birds about 25 years ago

00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:37.523
when I was still a practicing
botanist and a professor of agronomy

00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:43.150
and at that time I did submit it
to a few places for publication

00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:49.056
but there wasn't really in an
interest in the publishing world

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:49.940
for women who were far
ahead of their time.

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:55.473
So I brought back out from a hiding
place in a drawer in my office

00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:58.250
and tried again many years later.

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:02.226
&gt;&gt; There's a book Girls Look
on the Rocks by Danita Atkins.

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:06.886
And of course you've been honored.

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:10.413
It's a kinship to that book I feel.

00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:16.956
&gt;&gt; Margarita Engle.

00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:18.690
Thank you.

00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:20.690
I hope so.

00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:23.193
&gt;&gt; I hope I didn't miss this
but where did you first hear

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:29.486
about the Holocaust
survivors that came to Cuba

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:31.156
because I had never heard
of that until your book.

00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:32.983
&gt;&gt; Margarita Engle: You
know I'm just shocked

00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:35.783
of how little known it is.

00:23:36.050 --> 00:23:39.183
There's an amazing
non-fiction study for adults,

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:42.423
very detailed called
Tropical Diaspera by,

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:49.390
I'm sorry I can't remember the
first name but it's Levine.

00:23:49.690 --> 00:23:53.890
And it's just -- it's what alerted
me to this incredible subject

00:23:58.110 --> 00:23:58.193
that should be better
known and not just Cuba

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:01.563
but some other Latin American
countries also received a great many

00:24:04.690 --> 00:24:05.160
Holocaust refugees who
had been turned away

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:08.686
from the U.S. and Canada.

00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:10.020
Yes.

00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:15.443
&gt;&gt; Hi. Which authors do you
turn to like mentor types.

00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:21.050
Books that you read that inspire you
not like how to write books but ones

00:24:23.050 --> 00:24:25.050
that help you to write better.

00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:25.670
&gt;&gt; Margarita Engle: I love poetry

00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:31.336
and I just read poetry every
day before I do anything else.

00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:36.740
Early in the morning I grab whatever
poetry book is closest at hand

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:40.666
and I'll read the same
poetry books over and over.

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:44.566
But I really have to credit
Karen Hess' Witness as the book

00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:50.013
that helped to give me a form
for The Poet Slave of Cuba,

00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:52.560
the multiple voice, novel and verse.

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:57.393
I did get that idea
from her book Witness.

00:24:57.670 --> 00:25:01.870
I had been trying to write about
Juan Francisco Manzano in prose

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:04.506
and it just never worked.

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:09.173
And as soon as I switched to novel
and verse form inspired by her,

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:14.020
I never met her, but I always try
to credit that book, it just flowed.

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:17.693
So I think he was kind of
reaching down pounding me

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:21.080
on the head and saying I was a poet.

00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:22.896
Write about me in poetry.

00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:24.540
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:27.540
&gt;&gt; Margarita Engle: Thank you.

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:28.970
Yes.

00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:30.153
&gt;&gt; Hi. I am Jacqueline Jewels
and I met you in Seattle

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:33.786
at the ALJ convention
where you won --

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:35.653
&gt;&gt; Margarita Engle: Yes, thank you.

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:38.120
&gt;&gt; Sydney Taylor award
for Tropical Secrets

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:40.320
and while I was there I
bought Surrender Tree.

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:41.430
I read it on the plane ride home and
after that I read Firefly Letters

00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:46.596
and Tropical Secrets and I
just loved all three of them.

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:49.156
&gt;&gt; Margarita Engle:
Thank you so much.

00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:52.300
&gt;&gt; And I just want to thank you
for all three of those books.

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:53.546
&gt;&gt; Margarita Engle:
Thank you so much.

00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:55.746
[Applause] And you're
question reminds me

00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:57.116
to acknowledge the Sydney Taylor
award which is a wonderful award

00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:04.243
for Tropical Secrets
and I do want to mention

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:05.536
that my personal connection to
that story is that I did say

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:12.196
that my father is American and
traveled to Cuba, but his --

00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:12.350
he was born and raised in Los
Angeles but his parents came

00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:19.443
to the U.S. from the Ukraine
as refugees from pogroms.

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:24.693
So I do have a personal
connection to that story as well.

00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:26.033
&gt;&gt; Hi. I actually happen to be
a Cuban refugee from Trinidad

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.200
and I was wondering what's your
favorite Cuban writer or author?

00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:35.323
&gt;&gt; Margarita Engle: Well you
know you and I might be cousins

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:37.376
because that's a small town.

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:41.426
Everybody I've ever met
from there is a cousin.

00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:42.890


00:26:43.930 --> 00:26:47.996
[Laughter] I just read Christina
Garcia's Lady Matador's Hotel

00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:53.266
and really enjoyed it.

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:58.200
And for young adult books I really
enjoyed Nancy Osa's Cuba Fifteen

00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:04.223
and I just love so
many poets and authors.

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:09.413
My mind is cluttering up with names

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:13.573
and I can't choose one,
I'm sorry but thank you.

00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:15.596
&gt;&gt; Thank you for being here.

00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:16.666
&gt;&gt; Were there any other reasons
you decided to write in verse?

00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:25.113
&gt;&gt; Margarita Engle: I feel like for
me verse really helps me decide what

00:27:29.030 --> 00:27:33.430
I want to write about, because I
can't fit everything on that page.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.600
I end up with a very crowded page
and I really have to narrow my focus

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:42.856
down to the things that are
the most important to me,

00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:48.423
what aspects I really want to --

00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:53.270
and at the same time I feel like
I can put emotions in poetry --

00:27:57.530 --> 00:28:01.930
with all the crowded page there
wouldn't be room for those emotions

00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:07.446
in the same way in say a
non-fiction history book.

00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:11.073
And I love to read a
non-fiction history book

00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:11.606
but it's just not my
passion for writing.

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:15.906
My passion for writing
is with poetry.

00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:17.790
Thank you.

00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:19.790
Are you a poet?

00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:21.790
Thank you.

00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:23.790
[Applause]

00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:25.840
&gt;&gt; One more thing congratulations
to you rising to this stature.

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:29.940
&gt;&gt; Margarita Engle: Thank you.

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:30.206
&gt;&gt; My wife is a first time author.

00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:36.073
It is difficult to get published
if you're a first time author.

00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:42.383
So what we did is we self-published
and it's coming out in September.

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:43.683
But the problem is how
do you get recognized?

00:28:46.530 --> 00:28:47.930
Do you have an agent?

00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:49.710
&gt;&gt; Margarita Engle: No
I do not have an agent.

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:56.096
I sent the Poet Slave of Cuba into
what is called the slush pile.

00:28:56.870 --> 00:29:01.070
The slush pile is thousands and
thousands and thousands of books

00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:04.713
that editors sift through.

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:09.613
And just am so grateful that an
editor's assistant pulled the book

00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:15.490
out of the slush pile
and gave it a chance.

00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:19.663
&gt;&gt; We'll try real hard.

00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:22.730
&gt;&gt; Margarita Engle:
We'll try real hard.

00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:24.230
Yes.

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:26.913
&gt;&gt; Hi I'm just wondering if your
books are distributed in Cuba and if

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:28.880
so what kind of reception
they've received,

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:32.546
especially for the
Poet Slave in Cuba.

00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:33.713
&gt;&gt; Margarita Engle: No they aren't.

00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:37.313
There would not be any format

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:38.116
for an American book seller
to sell books in Cuba.

00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:42.710
The only one of my
books that is at present

00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:46.916
in a bilingual format
is The Surrender Tree,

00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:51.433
which is published now in a
paperback that has the entire novel

00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:53.356
and verse in English first and
then the entire novel and verse

00:29:56.570 --> 00:29:58.570
in Spanish in the same volume.

00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:02.643
It's not a facing page
bilingual translation.

00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:07.646
But I just don't think that at
present there would be a format

00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:12.703
for American publishers to -- I
think it would violate the Trading

00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:17.343
with the Enemies Act of 1962.

00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:22.943
I'm guessing at that, but I just
don't think there would be a format?

00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:25.393
Yes. Thank you so much.

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:29.186
You've just been a
wonderful audience.

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:30.720


00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:31.546
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
