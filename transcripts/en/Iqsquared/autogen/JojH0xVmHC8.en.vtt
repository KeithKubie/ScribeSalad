01:15:32.950 --> 01:15:34.830
and so that was just one example that is
just one example of the way I think the

01:15:34.830 --> 01:15:34.840
just one example of the way I think the
 

01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:37.620
just one example of the way I think the
left actually deny and frustrate talent

01:15:37.620 --> 01:15:37.630
left actually deny and frustrate talent
 

01:15:37.630 --> 01:15:39.660
left actually deny and frustrate talent
in a way that I think that people on the

01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:39.670
in a way that I think that people on the
 

01:15:39.670 --> 01:15:41.970
in a way that I think that people on the
right can can actually try and solve

01:15:41.970 --> 01:15:41.980
right can can actually try and solve
 

01:15:41.980 --> 01:15:43.560
right can can actually try and solve
those sort of problems I'm not saying

01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:43.570
those sort of problems I'm not saying
 

01:15:43.570 --> 01:15:44.970

the right is perfect I think Stella's

01:15:44.970 --> 01:15:44.980
the right is perfect I think Stella's
 

01:15:44.980 --> 01:15:47.280

there's lots of inadequacy on both sides
 

01:15:49.510 --> 01:15:51.090
there's lots of inadequacy on both sides
but I think the general broad approach

01:15:51.090 --> 01:15:51.100
but I think the general broad approach
 

01:15:51.100 --> 01:15:53.430
but I think the general broad approach
is much better on the right on these

01:15:53.430 --> 01:15:53.440
is much better on the right on these
 

01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:55.110
is much better on the right on these
issues and I'm delighted actually that

01:15:55.110 --> 01:15:55.120

Estela is quite right in emphasizing the

01:18:02.330 --> 01:18:02.340
Estela is quite right in emphasizing the

idea of equality is fundamental to the
left-wing vision but I think there's a

01:18:07.729 --> 01:18:07.739
left-wing vision but I think there's a
 

01:18:07.739 --> 01:18:11.540
left-wing vision but I think there's a
tendency to confuse equality and the

01:18:11.540 --> 01:18:11.550
tendency to confuse equality and the
 

01:18:11.550 --> 01:18:14.330

take them by moving away from the farm
 

01:18:48.249 --> 01:18:51.419
take them by moving away from the farm
by by turning their farm into something

01:18:51.419 --> 01:18:51.429
by by turning their farm into something
 

01:18:51.429 --> 01:18:53.969

01:19:09.239 --> 01:19:09.249
I think this is something that we have
 

01:19:09.249 --> 01:19:11.419
I think this is something that we have
