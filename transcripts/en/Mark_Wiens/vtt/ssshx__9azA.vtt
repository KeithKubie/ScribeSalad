00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:02.599
There's nothing like having a whole plate
of stink beans

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.520
right before you get on the airplane.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:05.060
Oh yah.

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:06.480
Chai mai krub Ying?

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.740
Hey everyone, it's Mark Wiens with migrationology.com.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:25.220
Today is the day, or actually a little bit
later tonight, my wife Ying and I will be

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.460
starting our round the world trip for food
with Star Alliance.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.809
And I have been so excited the last couple
days that last night I could barely even sleep

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:39.789
because I could not control my excitement
to start this trip.

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:43.809
I have some packing to do, actually I think
I might just show you a little bit of my packing,

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:46.629
I want to show you some of the gear that I'm
taking with me on this trip.

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.609
Then I'm going to have a quick dinner, then
we're going to jump in a taxi and we are on

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:51.649
our way to the airport.

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:56.219
I am very grateful to have an amazing wife
who packs all of my clothes.

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.059
Oh there she is.

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:01.100
But it is up to me to pack all of the electronics.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.159
I'm going to do this kind of quick and snappy.

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:07.430
I have three external hard drives each of
them are two terabytes each.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.500
These two I'll be backing up everything twice,
all of the content, all of the videos.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.200
These are battery chargers.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.159
I got four extra batteries.

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:16.159
Two cameras.

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.110
This is an extra lens.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.299
This is the main camera that I'll be using.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.620
I have an extra Rode video mic, this has a
terrible name, but it's really called a dead kitten,

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.369
which is to put over a microphone
to cancel out the wind.

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:32.369
It's a wind breaker.

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.520
A flashlight, some wires, some cleaning equipment,
my phone.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.159
Got my main computer here which I'll be editing
everything with, the cables, a mouse, you've

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:45.490
got to have a mouse when you're video editing.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.140
Some waterproof bags, some bags.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.119
These are the only tripods that I'll be using,
they are easy to handle and they are very

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.090
transportable, very easy.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.819
These are highly important, which are, and
I would recommend it for anyone who is traveling.

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:05.880
These are all purpose plugs for anywhere you
are in the world, there's nothing better than

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.820
arriving somewhere and you have no idea what
the plug is and not having to worry about

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.610
it, but you can just use this thing.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.800
It's all purpose.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.450
And then a, this is an extra battery.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.720
And one more thing that I always travel with
is a power strip.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.330
There are, it's amazing how all the hotels
around the world, they all seem to have just

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.280
one or two plugs, and when you have to plug
in five different things or ten different

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.300
things at once, this is absolutely key.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.610
Apart from, let me see if I can show you over
here.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.632
Oh here's Ying's makeup mirror, oh and there's
Ying.

00:02:41.632 --> 00:02:46.950
This is our second camera, so we'll be taking
two cameras with us, and yah that's all of

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.070
the gear that we'll be taking with us on this
trip to film this entire vlogging series and

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:53.310
making videos.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.511
Ying and I are going to be traveling for about
a month and a half outside of Thailand, so

00:02:58.511 --> 00:03:03.820
there was no way I was going to leave Southeast
Asia with out a plate of stink beans.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.090
Which is one of my all time favorite things
in the entire world.

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.120
My mother in law has just cooked a typical
meal that I eat at home all the time.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:20.450
We are going to definitely have dinner on
the airplane tonight as well.

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.230
They just never get old.

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.462
Oh they are so good.

00:03:23.462 --> 00:03:29.630
So refreshing and with such a unique taste
and texture and crispness to them.

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:35.940
Follow that with some of the tom yum broth
and a shallot.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.450
Mmm.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:38.960
Oh.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:44.200
It's nice and sour, it's a little bit salty
and you can just taste all of that lemongrass

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.120
and the chilies in there and the garlic.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:56.030
Let me scoot aside this pile of goodies and,
fish out one of the fish.

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.760
And then you can just kind of, what I like
to do is just put my spoon on the end of the

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:05.680
tail here, and just kind of slide my spoon
down, and you can get pretty much the entire

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.460
fillet of mackerel.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.540
Ohh that's hot.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.220
Off like that though.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.480
Buttery piece of mackerel.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.810
Ok perfect.

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.660
I just love mackerel, it's such a wonderful
flavorful fish.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.290
It's a little bit buttery and creamy and I
especially love it in tom yum because it's

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.900
it takes on the flavor of the lemongrass and
the lime juice and the fish sauce.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:35.660
But I could just not pass up the opportunity
to eat a final home cooked meal at home before

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.150
going on this trip.

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.920
Fufu, fufu bye bye.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.800
Bye bye.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.320
Doesn't he look like a sheep Ying?

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.600
Is that a real dog or is that a sheep?

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.530
Man mee ma kwa, mun bear.

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.000
Fufu sia jai.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.960
Fufu sia jai no?

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.840
Ying are you going to miss Fufu?

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.050
Ohhhh.

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.230
Ok bye!

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.780
We have about two and a half or two hours
and forty five minutes until our flight leaves,

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.500
hopefully the traffic won't be too bad.

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.610
The airport seems to be pretty quiet at this
time now.

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:39.850
It is about seven pm.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.180
Kob kun krub.

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.920
Check in then customs and immigration and
security was a breeze tonight.

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:56.860
Namaste.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.540
The reason that getting through customs and
immigration and checking in to our flight

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:11.660
was so easy is because that we are flying
on business class, and actually we're not

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.919
just flying on business class for this flight,
but for this entire round the world trip with

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:20.680
Star Alliance, so Ying and I are both not
only thrilled about the trip about the world

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:25.250
for food, but also about flying this entire
trip.

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:28.840
I can sleep here.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:33.640
Ying have you ever had this much leg space
on an airplane?

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.240
Thank you very much.

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:43.790
We are about to take off.

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.360
Thank you.

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:55.160
It is time now for pre-dinner snacks.

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.440
I'll start with the roasted almonds.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:12.060
One of the most important things to know about
eating in India is that there's veg and there's

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:19.140
non-veg, and veg of course means vegetarian,
but non-veg usually means any kind of meat,

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:21.490
or any kind of meat protein.

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:23.070
So I got non-veg.

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:27.260
There's a little bit of turbulence right now
so it's kind of shaky probably the camera

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:28.669
is shaking a little bit.

00:07:28.669 --> 00:07:30.460
But this sells really really good.

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:36.389
I got the prawns curry, and I was expecting
some little prawns but these are huge prawns

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:37.760
and you can really smell.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.290
Oh yah, that's exactly what I smell right
there, the spice, that's cardamom.

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:46.780
I got to go in for a roti right now or a chapati,
I think this is a chapati actually.

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:47.990
Oh this smells so good.

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:54.020
I was just going to grab some sauce but I
may as well go in for a whole prawn.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.900
Mmmmmm.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.780
That's pretty good.

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:07.280
I was so excited to start digging in to the
prawns curry that I forgot to even unravel

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:08.280
my napkin.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:13.000
I should probably put this onto my lap.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.520
It's actually pretty wonderful.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:22.040
The curry is not even oily at all, you can
just taste all of that spice, the cardamom

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:29.630
in there, maybe some cumin and then yah it's
really not oily or too buttery at all.

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:32.600
Oh I think it's daal.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.879
I think this is daal makhani, which is the
black lentils.

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:44.099
I just spilled all over my chin.

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:46.500
Mmmm.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.360
That's wonderful.

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:55.320
You can taste the cumin in there and then
that is kind of buttery.

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:08.000
Welcome to Chhatrapati Shivaji International
Airport Mumbai.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.920
The local time is thirty minutes past eleven
in the evening, and the temperature is twenty

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:14.480
seven degrees celcius.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.280
Thank you.

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:20.640
Yes!

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:25.020
Oh, welcome to Mumbai.

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:29.140
That was a great flight, and I'm happy to
be in India.

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:31.100
Ok bye bye.

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:32.939
Bye, nice to meet you.

00:09:32.939 --> 00:09:39.620
As soon as you pass through customs then there
is a prepaid taxi stand and so you can prepay

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:46.990
your taxi and then you choose either AC or
non AC and we are on our way to an area called

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:51.650
Colaba which is kind of the south part of
Mumbai.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:05.360
Thank you, thank you.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:09.540
It's about two am, we just checked into our
hotel which is called the Gordon House Hotel

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:12.769
right in the Colaba area in Mumbai.

00:10:12.769 --> 00:10:18.249
We're going to be staying here for four nights
and we'll be in Mumbai for a total of four

00:10:18.249 --> 00:10:24.079
about four full days which is not as long
as I would like, but we're going to be trying

00:10:24.079 --> 00:10:29.490
to cram in as much food and sightseeing as
possible during our time here.

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:37.429
So stay tuned for this whole series, many
delicious food vlogs coming up I'm anticipating

00:10:37.429 --> 00:10:39.850
and this is going to be a lot of fun.

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:41.519
Thank you all for watching.

00:10:41.519 --> 00:10:46.480
Please remember to give this video a thumbs
up and also make sure you subscribe if you're

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:53.220
not already subscribed so you don't miss the
next video, and yah, I will see you tomorrow

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:56.920
is going to be our first real day in Mumbai.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.760
And I am already loving how much leg space
there is on this seat.

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:12.720
What do I have on my sock?

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:15.760
Is that like a little, it looks like a fish
scale.

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:16.720
Ani arai krub?

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:17.720
Light.

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:19.120
Oh that's a light.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.380
I thought that was a, I thought this was a
microphone.
