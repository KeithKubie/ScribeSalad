00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.260
Another key point is that you don't need any

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:05.160
extensive knowledge of biology or genetics to take this course.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.570
&gt;&gt; The Udacity team has worked really hard to

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.520
make sure that this class is accessible for everyone.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.150
Ideally, you'll have some exposure to high school biology

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.740
but event that's not necessary. Now if you need resources

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.150
to help you out where you're in the course,

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.400
there are two main places for you to look. The

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.170
first is in the section titled Instructors' Notes. And

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.150
that's where we as your instructors will post relevant information

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.090
to the concepts and topics that you see in the videos. The

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.470
other important section is called Discussion Forums. And this is where you

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.480
and your fellow classmates can actually post links to topics, or questions

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.390
that you want to talk more about. For example, there is a discussion forum

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.080
on this page entitled the meaning of life. And I've put a

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.680
permanent link to it in the instructor's notes on this page. Now

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.440
I want you to click on that link and go see what

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.630
it says because you're going to need

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.380
the information to answer the following question.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.440
What is the answer to life, the universe, and everything?
