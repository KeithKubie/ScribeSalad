00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.540
 
let's do a couple of warm-up problems

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550
let's do a couple of warm-up problems
 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.940
let's do a couple of warm-up problems
converting fractions to percentages and

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950
converting fractions to percentages and
 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.980
converting fractions to percentages and
then converting percentages to fractions

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990
then converting percentages to fractions
 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.900
then converting percentages to fractions
and then we can do some actual word

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910
and then we can do some actual word
 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:09.740
and then we can do some actual word
problems

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750
problems
 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.720
problems
so our first warm-up let's convert 5

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:13.730
so our first warm-up let's convert 5
 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.349
so our first warm-up let's convert 5
over 24 to a percentage and the way I

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359
over 24 to a percentage and the way I
 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:19.700
over 24 to a percentage and the way I
like to do it I like to convert it to a

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710
like to do it I like to convert it to a
 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.380
like to do it I like to convert it to a
decimal first and once you have it in

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390
decimal first and once you have it in
 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.730
decimal first and once you have it in
the decimal form it's pretty

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740
the decimal form it's pretty
 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.470
the decimal form it's pretty
straightforward to convert it to a

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480
straightforward to convert it to a
 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.540
straightforward to convert it to a
percentage so the way you convert it to

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550
percentage so the way you convert it to
 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.609
percentage so the way you convert it to
a decimal is you divide the denominator

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619
a decimal is you divide the denominator
 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.859
a decimal is you divide the denominator
into the numerator this can literally be

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869
into the numerator this can literally be
 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.520
into the numerator this can literally be
read it's 5 divided by 24 so let's do a

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530
read it's 5 divided by 24 so let's do a
 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.860
read it's 5 divided by 24 so let's do a
little bit of division 24 goes into 5

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870
little bit of division 24 goes into 5
 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.880
little bit of division 24 goes into 5
and we're going to have to add some

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890
and we're going to have to add some
 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.860
and we're going to have to add some
extra spaces to the 5 because obviously

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870
extra spaces to the 5 because obviously
 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.740
extra spaces to the 5 because obviously
this is going to be less than 1 24 is a

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750
this is going to be less than 1 24 is a
 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.529
this is going to be less than 1 24 is a
larger number than 5 so let's put our

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539
larger number than 5 so let's put our
 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.439
larger number than 5 so let's put our
decimal right there and we can now do

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449
decimal right there and we can now do
 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.200
decimal right there and we can now do
some division 24 goes in to 5 0 times 0

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210
some division 24 goes in to 5 0 times 0
 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:04.609
some division 24 goes in to 5 0 times 0
times 24 is 0 5 minus 0 is 5 bring down

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619
times 24 is 0 5 minus 0 is 5 bring down
 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.890
times 24 is 0 5 minus 0 is 5 bring down
this 0 right here 24 goes into 50 well

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900
this 0 right here 24 goes into 50 well
 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.679
this 0 right here 24 goes into 50 well
it goes into that 2 times all right 2

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689
it goes into that 2 times all right 2
 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.289
it goes into that 2 times all right 2
times 24 is 2 times 4 is 8 2 times 2 is

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299
times 24 is 2 times 4 is 8 2 times 2 is
 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.420
times 24 is 2 times 4 is 8 2 times 2 is
4

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430
4
 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.560
4
now we subtract 50 minus 48 is to bring

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570
now we subtract 50 minus 48 is to bring
 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.410
now we subtract 50 minus 48 is to bring
down another 0 we're gonna keep bringing

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420
down another 0 we're gonna keep bringing
 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.660
down another 0 we're gonna keep bringing
down zeros until we have no remainder so

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670
down zeros until we have no remainder so
 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.999
down zeros until we have no remainder so
bring down another 0 24 goes into 20 0

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009
bring down another 0 24 goes into 20 0
 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:42.230
bring down another 0 24 goes into 20 0
times 0 times 24 is 0 20 minus 0 is 20

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240
times 0 times 24 is 0 20 minus 0 is 20
 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.310
times 0 times 24 is 0 20 minus 0 is 20
let's bring down another 0 let's bring

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320
let's bring down another 0 let's bring
 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:54.980
let's bring down another 0 let's bring
down another 0 24 goes into 200 24 goes

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990
down another 0 24 goes into 200 24 goes
 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.940
down another 0 24 goes into 200 24 goes
into 200 let's see 8 times maybe 9 times

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950
into 200 let's see 8 times maybe 9 times
 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.160
into 200 let's see 8 times maybe 9 times
its 180 now it'll be 8 times I believe

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170
its 180 now it'll be 8 times I believe
 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.649
its 180 now it'll be 8 times I believe
let's see if 8 time works there's always

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659
let's see if 8 time works there's always
 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.300
let's see if 8 time works there's always
a little bit of an art to this this is

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310
a little bit of an art to this this is
 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.770
a little bit of an art to this this is
too little we might have to increase it

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780
too little we might have to increase it
 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.240
too little we might have to increase it
8 times 4 is 32 30

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250
8 times 4 is 32 30
 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.580
8 times 4 is 32 30
- 8 times 2 is 16 plus 3 is 19 know that

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590
- 8 times 2 is 16 plus 3 is 19 know that
 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.150
- 8 times 2 is 16 plus 3 is 19 know that
that was right 8 times 200 minus 192

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160
that was right 8 times 200 minus 192
 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.060
that was right 8 times 200 minus 192
that's 8 that is 8 bring down another 0

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070
that's 8 that is 8 bring down another 0
 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:32.900
that's 8 that is 8 bring down another 0
bring down another 0 24 goes into 80 3

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910
bring down another 0 24 goes into 80 3
 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.560
bring down another 0 24 goes into 80 3
times can be 4 times 3 times 3 times 4

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570
times can be 4 times 3 times 3 times 4
 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:42.680
times can be 4 times 3 times 3 times 4
is 12 carry the 1 3 times 2 is 6 add 170

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690
is 12 carry the 1 3 times 2 is 6 add 170
 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.400
is 12 carry the 1 3 times 2 is 6 add 170
and then you have another 80 you bring

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410
and then you have another 80 you bring
 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.290
and then you have another 80 you bring
down another 0 we have an infinite

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300
down another 0 we have an infinite
 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.870
down another 0 we have an infinite
supply of zeros here as we need them now

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880
supply of zeros here as we need them now
 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.850
supply of zeros here as we need them now
we're gonna have another 80

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860
we're gonna have another 80
 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.800
we're gonna have another 80
well once again 24 is going to go into

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810
well once again 24 is going to go into
 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.240
well once again 24 is going to go into
that 3 times is we're gonna start

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250
that 3 times is we're gonna start
 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.340
that 3 times is we're gonna start
repeating these threes over and over and

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350
repeating these threes over and over and
 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.790
repeating these threes over and over and
over again so 5 over 24 let me write

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800
over again so 5 over 24 let me write
 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.949
over again so 5 over 24 let me write
this down 5 over 24 I want you

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959
this down 5 over 24 I want you
 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.300
this down 5 over 24 I want you
understand why it keeps repeating every

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310
understand why it keeps repeating every
 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.949
understand why it keeps repeating every
time we do this now we're gonna get a 3

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959
time we do this now we're gonna get a 3
 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.040
time we do this now we're gonna get a 3
and come down get a 70 - 80 from 72 or

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050
and come down get a 70 - 80 from 72 or
 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.630
and come down get a 70 - 80 from 72 or
you get another 80 we're just gonna have

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640
you get another 80 we're just gonna have
 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.000
you get another 80 we're just gonna have
a big string of threes there so 5

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010
a big string of threes there so 5
 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.710
a big string of threes there so 5
divided by 24 is zero point two zero

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720
divided by 24 is zero point two zero
 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.420
divided by 24 is zero point two zero
eight three repeating now if we want to

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430
eight three repeating now if we want to
 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.400
eight three repeating now if we want to
write this as a percentage the word

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410
write this as a percentage the word
 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.270
write this as a percentage the word
percentage the word percent / let me

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280
percentage the word percent / let me
 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.350
percentage the word percent / let me
split it up percent cent comes from the

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360
split it up percent cent comes from the
 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.250
split it up percent cent comes from the
word 400 this is per hundred so what is

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260
word 400 this is per hundred so what is
 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.759
word 400 this is per hundred so what is
this this is 0.2 Oh what is this /

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769
this this is 0.2 Oh what is this /
 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.770
this this is 0.2 Oh what is this /
hundred we're a hundred is a whole and

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780
hundred we're a hundred is a whole and
 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.680
hundred we're a hundred is a whole and
that might confuse or might not but one

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690
that might confuse or might not but one
 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:46.910
that might confuse or might not but one
way you could view this is this is the

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920
way you could view this is this is the
 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.580
way you could view this is this is the
same thing as you could view it as this

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590
same thing as you could view it as this
 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.990
same thing as you could view it as this
way this is the same thing this decimal

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000
way this is the same thing this decimal
 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.930
way this is the same thing this decimal
zero point two oh eight three repeating

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940
zero point two oh eight three repeating
 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.560
zero point two oh eight three repeating
is the same thing as twenty point eight

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570
is the same thing as twenty point eight
 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.970
is the same thing as twenty point eight
three repeating over 100 this is how

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980
three repeating over 100 this is how
 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.600
three repeating over 100 this is how
many we have per hundred percent or you

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610
many we have per hundred percent or you
 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.539
many we have per hundred percent or you
could say that this is equal to twenty

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549
could say that this is equal to twenty
 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:16.490
could say that this is equal to twenty
point eight three repeating percent per

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500
point eight three repeating percent per
 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.250
point eight three repeating percent per
100 these are equivalent a very quick

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260
100 these are equivalent a very quick
 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.690
100 these are equivalent a very quick
way to think about how to go from

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700
way to think about how to go from
 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.420
way to think about how to go from
decimals to percent as you can multiply

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430
decimals to percent as you can multiply
 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.830
decimals to percent as you can multiply
by

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840
by
 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.930
by
100 and then put the percentage sign or

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940
100 and then put the percentage sign or
 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.820
100 and then put the percentage sign or
if you go backwards you divide by a

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830
if you go backwards you divide by a
 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.710
if you go backwards you divide by a
hundred and get rid of the percentage

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720
hundred and get rid of the percentage
 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.930
hundred and get rid of the percentage
sign that was a good warm-up let's do

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940
sign that was a good warm-up let's do
 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.330

let's do one more let's convert a pret

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340
let's do one more let's convert a pret
 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.990
let's do one more let's convert a pret
percentage into a fraction I'll do it in

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000
percentage into a fraction I'll do it in
 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.220
percentage into a fraction I'll do it in
blue so let's say we have 16% 16%

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230
blue so let's say we have 16% 16%
 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.909
blue so let's say we have 16% 16%
remember this means 16 per hundred so

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919
remember this means 16 per hundred so
 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:49.370
remember this means 16 per hundred so
this is the same thing as 16 per hundred

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380
this is the same thing as 16 per hundred
 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.920
this is the same thing as 16 per hundred
that's what per cent century is a

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930
that's what per cent century is a
 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.870
that's what per cent century is a
hundred years there are a hundred cents

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880
hundred years there are a hundred cents
 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.110
hundred years there are a hundred cents
in a dollar so 16 over 100 put that in

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120
in a dollar so 16 over 100 put that in
 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.100
in a dollar so 16 over 100 put that in
the lowest cut let's see we can divide

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110
the lowest cut let's see we can divide
 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.750
the lowest cut let's see we can divide
the numerator denominator by 4 we get 4

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760
the numerator denominator by 4 we get 4
 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.460
the numerator denominator by 4 we get 4
over 25

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470
over 25
 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.650
over 25
so that's our warm-up let's do some

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660
so that's our warm-up let's do some
 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.150
so that's our warm-up let's do some
actual problems now all right they tell

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160
actual problems now all right they tell
 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.170
actual problems now all right they tell
us a TV is advertised on sale it is 35

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180
us a TV is advertised on sale it is 35
 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.050
us a TV is advertised on sale it is 35
percent off and has a new price of a

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060
percent off and has a new price of a
 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.510
percent off and has a new price of a
hundred ninety five dollars what was the

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520
hundred ninety five dollars what was the
 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.740
hundred ninety five dollars what was the
pre sale price so if X is the pre sale X

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750
pre sale price so if X is the pre sale X
 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:30.320
pre sale price so if X is the pre sale X
is the pre sale price when you take 35

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330
is the pre sale price when you take 35
 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.719
is the pre sale price when you take 35
percent off of that it has a new price

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:32.729
percent off of that it has a new price
 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:34.580
percent off of that it has a new price
of one hundred ninety five dollars

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590
of one hundred ninety five dollars
 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:40.850
of one hundred ninety five dollars
so X minus 35 percent of X 0.35 is the

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860
so X minus 35 percent of X 0.35 is the
 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.060
so X minus 35 percent of X 0.35 is the
same thing as 35 percent so if I take X

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070
same thing as 35 percent so if I take X
 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:48.529
same thing as 35 percent so if I take X
and I subtract 35 percent of X from X

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:48.539
and I subtract 35 percent of X from X
 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:51.560
and I subtract 35 percent of X from X
I'm going to get one hundred and ninety

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:51.570
I'm going to get one hundred and ninety
 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:53.420
I'm going to get one hundred and ninety
five dollars that's what that is telling

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:53.430
five dollars that's what that is telling
 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.540
five dollars that's what that is telling
me so now we just solve for X so you can

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:56.550
me so now we just solve for X so you can
 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:02.960
me so now we just solve for X so you can
view this as 1x 1x minus 0.35 X that

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:02.970
view this as 1x 1x minus 0.35 X that
 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:10.400
view this as 1x 1x minus 0.35 X that
will be 0.65 X so this is 0.65 X right

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:10.410
will be 0.65 X so this is 0.65 X right
 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:11.690
will be 0.65 X so this is 0.65 X right
if you add point six five two point

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:11.700
if you add point six five two point
 

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.360
if you add point six five two point
three five you get one right one minus

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:14.370
three five you get one right one minus
 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:20.120
three five you get one right one minus
0.35 is 0.65 X is equal to 195 and now

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.130
0.35 is 0.65 X is equal to 195 and now
 

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:22.820
0.35 is 0.65 X is equal to 195 and now
you can divide both sides of this

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.830
you can divide both sides of this
 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.159
you can divide both sides of this
equation actually I like to do it more

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:25.169
equation actually I like to do it more
 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:26.540
equation actually I like to do it more
as a fraction so let me write it that

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:26.550
as a fraction so let me write it that
 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:32.090
as a fraction so let me write it that
way so if you have 65 over 100 X is

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:32.100
way so if you have 65 over 100 X is
 

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.750
way so if you have 65 over 100 X is
equal to 195 now we can multiply both

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:35.760
equal to 195 now we can multiply both
 

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.330
equal to 195 now we can multiply both
sides of this equation by the inverse

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:38.340
sides of this equation by the inverse
 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:39.560
sides of this equation by the inverse
even before I do that let me simplify

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:39.570
even before I do that let me simplify
 

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:41.570
even before I do that let me simplify
this fraction I can divide the numerator

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:41.580
this fraction I can divide the numerator
 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:45.020
this fraction I can divide the numerator
in the denominator by 5 and this becomes

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:45.030
in the denominator by 5 and this becomes
 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:51.170
in the denominator by 5 and this becomes
13 over 20 so we get 13 over 20 X is

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:51.180
13 over 20 so we get 13 over 20 X is
 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:54.409
13 over 20 so we get 13 over 20 X is
equal to 195 and now we can multiply

00:06:54.409 --> 00:06:54.419
equal to 195 and now we can multiply
 

00:06:54.419 --> 00:06:57.110
equal to 195 and now we can multiply
both sides by the inverse of this so 20

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120
both sides by the inverse of this so 20
 

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:01.550
both sides by the inverse of this so 20
over 13 times that is equal to 195 times

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:01.560
over 13 times that is equal to 195 times
 

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:06.080
over 13 times that is equal to 195 times
20 over 13 these cancel out and we get X

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:06.090
20 over 13 these cancel out and we get X
 

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:12.830
20 over 13 these cancel out and we get X
is equal to 195 times 20 over 13 which

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:12.840
is equal to 195 times 20 over 13 which
 

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.150
is equal to 195 times 20 over 13 which
we could figure out but I'll take the

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.160
we could figure out but I'll take the
 

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.670
we could figure out but I'll take the
calculator out for this one

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:15.680
calculator out for this one
 

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:21.800
calculator out for this one
so you see you get 195 times 20 divided

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:21.810
so you see you get 195 times 20 divided
 

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:27.230
so you see you get 195 times 20 divided
by divided by 13 is equal to $300 I

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:27.240
by divided by 13 is equal to $300 I
 

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.820
by divided by 13 is equal to $300 I
should have done that on so this is

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:28.830
should have done that on so this is
 

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:31.969
should have done that on so this is
equal to that right there is equal to

00:07:31.969 --> 00:07:31.979
equal to that right there is equal to
 

00:07:31.979 --> 00:07:34.969
equal to that right there is equal to
three hundred dollars so 195 is actually

00:07:34.969 --> 00:07:34.979
three hundred dollars so 195 is actually
 

00:07:34.979 --> 00:07:37.070
three hundred dollars so 195 is actually
divisible by 13 or I should be able to

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:37.080
divisible by 13 or I should be able to
 

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.719
divisible by 13 or I should be able to
do that without a calculator anyway so

00:07:38.719 --> 00:07:38.729
do that without a calculator anyway so
 

00:07:38.729 --> 00:07:42.980
do that without a calculator anyway so
the original price was $300 you take 35%

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:42.990
the original price was $300 you take 35%
 

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:46.610
the original price was $300 you take 35%
of $300 which is a hundred and five

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:46.620
of $300 which is a hundred and five
 

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:49.129
of $300 which is a hundred and five
dollars and you will be left with one

00:07:49.129 --> 00:07:49.139
dollars and you will be left with one
 

00:07:49.139 --> 00:07:50.659
dollars and you will be left with one
hundred and ninety five dollars so that

00:07:50.659 --> 00:07:50.669
hundred and ninety five dollars so that
 

00:07:50.669 --> 00:07:54.500
hundred and ninety five dollars so that
was our original price one let's do

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:54.510
was our original price one let's do
 

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:59.300
was our original price one let's do

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:07.470
950 plus another 12% its 1.1 2 times 950
 

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:10.490
950 plus another 12% its 1.1 2 times 950
is going to be equal to our new number

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:10.500
is going to be equal to our new number
 

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.560
is going to be equal to our new number
let me multiply this out I don't just to

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:12.570
let me multiply this out I don't just to
 

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:14.210
let me multiply this out I don't just to
make up for me using the calculator the

00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:14.220
make up for me using the calculator the
 

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:21.530
make up for me using the calculator the
last time so 950 times 1/12 2 times 0 is

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:21.540
last time so 950 times 1/12 2 times 0 is
 

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:28.280
last time so 950 times 1/12 2 times 0 is
0 2 times 5 is 10 2 times 9 is 18 plus 1

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:28.290
0 2 times 5 is 10 2 times 9 is 18 plus 1
 

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:34.100
0 2 times 5 is 10 2 times 9 is 18 plus 1
is 19 it'll put a 0 here 1 times you

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:34.110
is 19 it'll put a 0 here 1 times you
 

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:37.550
is 19 it'll put a 0 here 1 times you
just 1 times 0 is 0 1 times 5 is 5 1

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:37.560
just 1 times 0 is 0 1 times 5 is 5 1
 

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:40.670
just 1 times 0 is 0 1 times 5 is 5 1
times 9 is 9 let's put it up put 2

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:40.680
times 9 is 9 let's put it up put 2
 

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:44.990
times 9 is 9 let's put it up put 2
zeroes here 1 times 0 is 0 1 times 5 is

00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:45.000
zeroes here 1 times 0 is 0 1 times 5 is
 

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.780
zeroes here 1 times 0 is 0 1 times 5 is
5 1 times 9 is 9 and now we can add now

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:50.790
5 1 times 9 is 9 and now we can add now
 

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:53.660
5 1 times 9 is 9 and now we can add now
we can add the 0 is that up to 0 0 is

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:53.670
we can add the 0 is that up to 0 0 is
 

00:09:53.670 --> 00:10:00.760
we can add the 0 is that up to 0 0 is
that up to 0 9 plus 5 is 14 2 plus 9 is

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:00.770
that up to 0 9 plus 5 is 14 2 plus 9 is
 

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:08.630
that up to 0 9 plus 5 is 14 2 plus 9 is
11 plus 5 is 16 16 1 plus 9 is 10 and

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:08.640
11 plus 5 is 16 16 1 plus 9 is 10 and
 

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.120
11 plus 5 is 16 16 1 plus 9 is 10 and
then we count the number of decimal we

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:11.130
then we count the number of decimal we
 

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:14.930
then we count the number of decimal we
have 1 2 3 4 numbers behind the decimal

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:14.940
have 1 2 3 4 numbers behind the decimal
 

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:18.500
have 1 2 3 4 numbers behind the decimal
so in our answer we have to have 1 2 3 4

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:18.510
so in our answer we have to have 1 2 3 4
 

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:22.310
so in our answer we have to have 1 2 3 4
numbers behind the decimal so her new

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:22.320
numbers behind the decimal so her new
 

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:25.490
numbers behind the decimal so her new
salary will be 10 dollars and 64 cents

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:25.500
salary will be 10 dollars and 64 cents
 

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.790
salary will be 10 dollars and 64 cents
per hour 10 dollars and 64 you don't

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:28.800
per hour 10 dollars and 64 you don't
 

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.190
per hour 10 dollars and 64 you don't
have to write those trailing zeros right

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:31.200
have to write those trailing zeros right
 

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.680
have to write those trailing zeros right
there so this is her new hourly rate

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:33.690
there so this is her new hourly rate
 

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:37.910
there so this is her new hourly rate
after the raise all right let's do one

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:37.920
after the raise all right let's do one
 

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:42.710
after the raise all right let's do one
more one more store a and store B both

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:42.720
more one more store a and store B both
 

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.810
more one more store a and store B both
sell bikes and both buy bikes from the

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:44.820
sell bikes and both buy bikes from the
 

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:47.630
sell bikes and both buy bikes from the
same supplier at the same price store a

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:47.640
same supplier at the same price store a
 

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:50.570
same supplier at the same price store a
has a forty percent markup story has a

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:50.580
has a forty percent markup story has a
 

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:52.100
has a forty percent markup story has a
forty percent markup that means whatever

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:52.110
forty percent markup that means whatever
 

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:53.870
forty percent markup that means whatever
they buy the bike for they sell it for

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:53.880
they buy the bike for they sell it for
 

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:57.020
they buy the bike for they sell it for
forty percent above that while store B

00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:57.030
forty percent above that while store B
 

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:58.720
forty percent above that while store B
has a fifty two hundred fifty percent

00:10:58.720 --> 00:10:58.730
has a fifty two hundred fifty percent
 

00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:01.550
has a fifty two hundred fifty percent
store B has a two hundred and fifty

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:01.560
store B has a two hundred and fifty
 

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:04.100
store B has a two hundred and fifty
percent markup store B has a permanent

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:04.110
percent markup store B has a permanent
 

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:06.140
percent markup store B has a permanent
sale and always will sell

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:06.150
sale and always will sell
 

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:09.260
sale and always will sell
66% off those prices which store has a

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:09.270
66% off those prices which store has a
 

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:11.060
66% off those prices which store has a
better deal so let's say that there's

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:11.070
better deal so let's say that there's
 

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:13.760
better deal so let's say that there's
both buying the bike so let's X is equal

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:13.770
both buying the bike so let's X is equal
 

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:18.700
both buying the bike so let's X is equal
to the price from supplier price from

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:18.710
to the price from supplier price from
 

00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:21.170
to the price from supplier price from
supplier so that's the price that both

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:21.180
supplier so that's the price that both
 

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:24.050
supplier so that's the price that both
bike stores buy their bicycles at right

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:24.060
bike stores buy their bicycles at right
 

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:25.760
bike stores buy their bicycles at right
they both buy bikes from the supplier at

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:25.770
they both buy bikes from the supplier at
 

00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:28.670
they both buy bikes from the supplier at
the same price that's this X that I'm

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:28.680
the same price that's this X that I'm
 

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:30.950
the same price that's this X that I'm
going to start off with now let's do the

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:30.960
going to start off with now let's do the
 

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:34.160
going to start off with now let's do the
scenario of store a what does store a

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:34.170
scenario of store a what does store a
 

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:36.530
scenario of store a what does store a
sell their bike for they sell the bike

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:36.540
sell their bike for they sell the bike
 

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:43.130
sell their bike for they sell the bike
for X plus 40% of X plus 40% of X which

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:43.140
for X plus 40% of X plus 40% of X which
 

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:47.269
for X plus 40% of X plus 40% of X which
is equal to 1.4 times X that's how much

00:11:47.269 --> 00:11:47.279
is equal to 1.4 times X that's how much
 

00:11:47.279 --> 00:11:50.269
is equal to 1.4 times X that's how much
store a sells their bike for now store B

00:11:50.269 --> 00:11:50.279
store a sells their bike for now store B
 

00:11:50.279 --> 00:11:53.540
store a sells their bike for now store B
is a little bit more interesting store B

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:53.550
is a little bit more interesting store B
 

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:57.769
is a little bit more interesting store B
so they have a 250% markup so they sell

00:11:57.769 --> 00:11:57.779
so they have a 250% markup so they sell
 

00:11:57.779 --> 00:11:59.720
so they have a 250% markup so they sell
the will they claim to sell their bike

00:11:59.720 --> 00:11:59.730
the will they claim to sell their bike
 

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:03.560
the will they claim to sell their bike
for X plus 250 percent that's the same

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:03.570
for X plus 250 percent that's the same
 

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:08.510
for X plus 250 percent that's the same
thing as to 0.5 times X a hundred

00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:08.520
thing as to 0.5 times X a hundred
 

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:10.100
thing as to 0.5 times X a hundred
percent markup would literally mean

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:10.110
percent markup would literally mean
 

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:13.370
percent markup would literally mean
another X this is 250 percent you know

00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:13.380
another X this is 250 percent you know
 

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:15.199
another X this is 250 percent you know
as we said you can just divide by a you

00:12:15.199 --> 00:12:15.209
as we said you can just divide by a you
 

00:12:15.209 --> 00:12:17.570
as we said you can just divide by a you
can just divide by 100 you get 2.5 get

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:17.580
can just divide by 100 you get 2.5 get
 

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:19.490
can just divide by 100 you get 2.5 get
rid of the percentage sign so they sell

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:19.500
rid of the percentage sign so they sell
 

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:23.920
rid of the percentage sign so they sell
it X plus 2.5 X which is equal to 3.5 x

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:23.930
it X plus 2.5 X which is equal to 3.5 x
 

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:26.870
it X plus 2.5 X which is equal to 3.5 x
that's kind of their ticket price but

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:26.880
that's kind of their ticket price but
 

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:30.170
that's kind of their ticket price but
then they sell at a 60% off those prices

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:30.180
then they sell at a 60% off those prices
 

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:33.470
then they sell at a 60% off those prices
so they take 60% off of this price right

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:33.480
so they take 60% off of this price right
 

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:36.620
so they take 60% off of this price right
here so the real selling price is going

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:36.630
here so the real selling price is going
 

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:40.400
here so the real selling price is going
to be three point five times the price

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:40.410
to be three point five times the price
 

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:46.100
to be three point five times the price
from the supplier minus 0.6 minus 0.6

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:46.110
from the supplier minus 0.6 minus 0.6
 

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:53.090
from the supplier minus 0.6 minus 0.6
minus 60% of this price of 3.5 X and we

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:53.100
minus 60% of this price of 3.5 X and we
 

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:56.150
minus 60% of this price of 3.5 X and we
could view this as one times three point

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:56.160
could view this as one times three point
 

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.850
could view this as one times three point
five X minus 0.6 times three point five

00:12:58.850 --> 00:12:58.860
five X minus 0.6 times three point five
 

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:02.540
five X minus 0.6 times three point five
x and that's the same thing as 1 minus

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:02.550
x and that's the same thing as 1 minus
 

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:10.400
x and that's the same thing as 1 minus
zero point six times 3.5 X this is going

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:10.410
zero point six times 3.5 X this is going
 

00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:14.690
zero point six times 3.5 X this is going
to be 0.4 this is zero point four so if

00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:14.700
to be 0.4 this is zero point four so if
 

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:16.760
to be 0.4 this is zero point four so if
you're getting 60% off it's equivalent

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:16.770
you're getting 60% off it's equivalent
 

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:19.950
you're getting 60% off it's equivalent
of selling it at 40% of the ticket price

00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:19.960
of selling it at 40% of the ticket price
 

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:21.060
of selling it at 40% of the ticket price
what we're doing right there you might

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:21.070
what we're doing right there you might
 

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:22.020
what we're doing right there you might
eventually do this in your head

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:22.030
eventually do this in your head
 

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:24.600
eventually do this in your head
immediately say Oh 60% off is the same

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:24.610
immediately say Oh 60% off is the same
 

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:27.030
immediately say Oh 60% off is the same
thing as selling at 40% or selling at

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:27.040
thing as selling at 40% or selling at
 

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:30.960
thing as selling at 40% or selling at
point four of the price 5x and let's

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:30.970
point four of the price 5x and let's
 

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:35.040
point four of the price 5x and let's
multiply that out so if we take three

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:35.050
multiply that out so if we take three
 

00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:39.510
multiply that out so if we take three
point five times zero point four four

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:39.520
point five times zero point four four
 

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:42.360
point five times zero point four four
times five is twenty four times three is

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:42.370
times five is twenty four times three is
 

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:46.670
times five is twenty four times three is
12 plus 2 is 14 and we have one two

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:46.680
12 plus 2 is 14 and we have one two
 

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:50.430
