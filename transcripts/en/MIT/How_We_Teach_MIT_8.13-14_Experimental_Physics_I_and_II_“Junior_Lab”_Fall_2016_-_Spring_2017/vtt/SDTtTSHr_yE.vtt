EFETOBORE TASKER: I would say
that I know for me, personally,

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:11.560
this class--

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.465
it's one thing to learn physics
in a classroom situation

00:00:14.465 --> 00:00:15.840
where you're just
learning or you

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.506
have like mathematical
proofs and you're

00:00:17.506 --> 00:00:18.522
taking that as truth.

00:00:18.522 --> 00:00:20.980
But in this class, you really
put those things to the test,

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.440
and you see that, oh, these
things I learned in class

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.260
are actually true because I
can see it on a computer screen

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.277
that my physical results match
a theoretical prediction.

00:00:30.277 --> 00:00:32.860
So I'd say that anybody wants
to replicate this sort of format

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.710
at another school--

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.800
it's great to have
experiments that

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.450
prove simple foundational
physics that you learn

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.591
in the classroom just
so the students can see

00:00:45.591 --> 00:00:47.590
that the things that they
learn in the classroom

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.890
are a real physical phenomenon
that they can observe.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.680
SAARIK KALIA: Yeah, I
think one of the key things

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.140
for this class is obviously
just the facilities--

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.300
like having the experiments.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.070
But I also think
it's good to have

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.440
instructors who really
understand the experiments as

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.340
well.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.600
Because a lot of the
times they're just

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.850
looking through the lab guide.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.820
It might not be clear
how certain things work,

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.760
so it was very helpful to have
instructors around who we could

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.710
to ask questions and get
answers that would really

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.240
enhance our understanding of
what was actually going on.
