help you can you prevent them from
 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:13.460
help you can you prevent them from
screwing you up can you force them to do

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470
screwing you up can you force them to do
 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.039

there's a whole array of spiritual
 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.290
there's a whole array of spiritual
technologies and I think technology is

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300
technologies and I think technology is
 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.470
technologies and I think technology is
the right term to use here of spiritual

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480
the right term to use here of spiritual
 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.840
the right term to use here of spiritual
technologies to achieve these sorts of

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850
technologies to achieve these sorts of
 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:44.030

earliest part of the Iliad you're
 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.480
earliest part of the Iliad you're
dealing with the idea that this

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:15.490
dealing with the idea that this
 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.810

will be able to to reach Troy so you can
 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:36.030
will be able to to reach Troy so you can
have a notion that by sacrificing you

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040
have a notion that by sacrificing you
 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.230
have a notion that by sacrificing you
can cause something happen then you can

that was predicated upon observation of
 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.180
that was predicated upon observation of
nature and it's the science of the

you simply ascribed miracles and of

you simply ascribed miracles and of
course down the present day if you're

course down the present day if you're
going to be canonized you have to be

going to be canonized you have to be
 

00:58:21.790 --> 00:58:23.250
going to be canonized you have to be
able to perform miracles or at least

so that's one direction and as I say
 

00:58:30.780 --> 00:58:33.310
so that's one direction and as I say
it's a it's a non-scientist ik one

it's a it's a non-scientist ik one
 

00:58:33.320 --> 00:58:35.840
it's a it's a non-scientist ik one
another direction that I mention is the

00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:35.850
another direction that I mention is the
 

00:58:35.850 --> 00:58:40.160
another direction that I mention is the
numerological where you preserve a

certain scientistic element but you
 

00:58:43.890 --> 00:58:48.800
certain scientistic element but you
become increasingly arcane in terms of

the inability of most people to to

that is more important is the rise of

that is more important is the rise of
 

00:59:07.530 --> 00:59:14.450
that is more important is the rise of
the notion of fate or chance now you go

00:59:14.450 --> 00:59:14.460
the notion of fate or chance now you go
 

00:59:14.460 --> 00:59:19.850

fate was a little bit different because

you could say there is a certain

are born that timeline is established
 

00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:55.190
are born that timeline is established
and fate will bring it to an end at a

00:59:55.190 --> 00:59:55.200
and fate will bring it to an end at a
 

00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:57.830
and fate will bring it to an end at a
given point and that fit pretty well

00:59:57.830 --> 00:59:57.840
