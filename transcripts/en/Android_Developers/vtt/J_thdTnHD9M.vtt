00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.750
SPEAKER: We've selected
10 tips to help

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.780
you get ready to
launch your news app,

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.437
and start gaining readers
as effectively as possible.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.940
1.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.070
Test on real devices and
identify early issues.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.870
Your readers are
consuming your news

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.500
on a whole range of
smart phones and tablets.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.510
So it's important to test
with as many Android devices

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.960
as possible, in order to
flag and fix any issues.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.390
The Pre-Launch Report in the
Google Play Developer Console

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.970
identifies crashes, and
displays issues and security

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.470
vulnerabilities.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.280
The report is powered
by Firebase Test Lab,

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.000
and is generated every
time you upload and publish

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.200
an alpha or beta APK.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.380
You can also use a
Firebase Test Lab

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.720
paid offering if you
want to run customized

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.240
testing across a wide
range of devices,

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.290
even the ones that
are hard to come by.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:01.010
2.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.430
Run alpha and beta tests.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.550
A new app or update
that readers love

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.750
gets good ratings and reviews
that help drive more downloads.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.090
By sharing your app with readers
through alpha or beta tests,

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.660
you can gather feedback
on potential issues

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.880
without affecting the app's
public ratings and reviews.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.280
You can then fix any issues
before the public release.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.540
A great way to build
your beta user community

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.370
and engage your loyal
readers is to invite

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.000
people who've left you a
review in the Play Store

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.400
by sharing the sign-up URL.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.910
3.

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.691
Release your updates in stages.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.590
We know you have
a large audience,

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.050
and your brand
integrity matters.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.250
Google Play staged
roll-outs help

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.870
to catch any outstanding
issues not found

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.000
during testing by progressively
rolling out updates

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.430
to a small percentage
of readers.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.219
This means if you
catch any issues,

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:59.260
you can halt the rollout.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:03.520
4.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.510
Reply to reviews.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.699
News readers can be quite vocal.

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:11.180
Use this to your
advantage to build loyalty

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.090
and engage your audience.

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.660
App reviews often
contain valuable feedback

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.120
and suggestions for
improving your app.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.320
So read them regularly.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.280
Replying to reviews
engages your readers.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.350
When you respond to
negative reviews,

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.980
try and indicate how and when
you'll address the feedback.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.700
Moreover, you can take advantage
of the Review Analysis reports

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.880
in the Developer
Console to see how

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.940
users review your
app in relation

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.110
to specific categories.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.060
The two reports,
Benchmarks and Topics,

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.360
analyze how each topic impacts
your overall app rating.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.250
5.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.685
Monitor your crash reports.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.430
Google Play collates
information about your app,

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.910
and makes it available in the
Google Play Developer Console.

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.710
If your app crashes,
you'll be able to see why

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.810
and fix the issue quickly.

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.450
You can also use
Firebase Crash Reporting.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:08.650
6.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.680
Run experiments on
your store listing.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.770
When users open
your app's listing,

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.800
they'll almost instantly decide
if your app meets their needs.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.530
Unique icons, a short,
to-the-point description,

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.530
and good quality,
relevant images

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.950
showing your news
home page and articles

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.810
will grab their attention.

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.920
You can use store
listing experiments

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.050
to help find the best
combination of these elements.

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.230
7.

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.980
Drive "over-the-air"
installs from your site.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.000
Sign readers in with
Google on your website.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.500
Then offer the option to
install your app over the air.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.930
In the Google Play Developer
Console, create a project

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.170
and register your
website and app clients.

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.890
Add the app installation
prompt to your website sign-in.

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.900
8.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.320
Link users straight into your
native app with App Links.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.680
Users following web
links on devices

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.900
are frequently presented
with confusing choices.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.150
Tapping a link often
results in the system

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.440
asking the user which app
should handle that link.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.910
Use the App Link extension to
ensure that deep links open

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:19.970
in your app.

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.820
Use also the Chrome
native app install banner

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.050
on your news website, so that
readers who don't have your app

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.370
installed, and are directed
to your website from a share,

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.610
can easily install your app.

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:32.660
9.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.570
Optimize for word-of-mouth
growth with Firebase invites.

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.810
Word of mouth is one of the most
effective ways of getting users

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.600
to install your app.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.020
Use Firebase invites to make
it simple for your readers

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.480
to send content to their
friends over both SMS and email.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.580
It ensures that referral codes,
recipe entries, or other shared

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.520
content gets passed along
with the invitation.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.150
No cutting and pasting required.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.950
10.

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.721
Get your app in Google search.

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:09.400
Having your app's content
included in search results

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.620
exposes it to a huge
potential audience.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.560
Use app indexing to surface your
branded app's install button

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.120
in search results, and
make it easy for readers

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.900
to acquire your app.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.780
Head over to Google
Play Developer

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.440
Console to start taking
advantage of these features.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.380

to improve your news apps
