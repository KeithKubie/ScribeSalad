00:00:00.211 --> 00:00:01.960
- [Voiceover] We just
derived what the current is

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:02.949
and the voltage.

00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:06.382
These are both the natural
response of the RC.

00:00:06.382 --> 00:00:10.145
Now what I did is I went
ahead and I plotted out this

00:00:10.145 --> 00:00:13.141
using a computer, just using Excel,

00:00:13.141 --> 00:00:15.510
to plot out what these
two expressions look like,

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.593
and let me show you that.

00:00:23.406 --> 00:00:25.667
So let's do a real quick example here

00:00:25.667 --> 00:00:29.834
with real values just to
see how this equation works.

00:00:31.981 --> 00:00:34.663
We'll say that this is 1,000 ohms.

00:00:34.663 --> 00:00:36.330
That's our resistor.

00:00:37.265 --> 00:00:40.098
And we'll say C is one microfarad.

00:00:42.187 --> 00:00:45.947
And what we wanna work out is R times C

00:00:45.947 --> 00:00:47.780
equals 10 to the third

00:00:50.385 --> 00:00:52.468
times 10 to the minus six

00:00:53.538 --> 00:00:57.288
and that equals 10 to
the minus three seconds

00:00:59.555 --> 00:01:01.138
or one millisecond.

00:01:04.823 --> 00:01:07.985
That's the product of R and C.

00:01:07.985 --> 00:01:09.130
I forgot V-naught.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.501
Let's say we put two
volts on this capacitor

00:01:13.501 --> 00:01:15.584
to start with, like that.

00:01:19.415 --> 00:01:23.415
And now we can say V of
t equals V-naught two volts

00:01:27.418 --> 00:01:31.085
times e to the minus t
over one millisecond.

00:01:35.292 --> 00:01:38.933
And that's our natural response
for this particular circuit.

00:01:38.933 --> 00:01:42.350
Now let me show you what that looks like.

00:01:44.587 --> 00:01:46.920
This is V of t on this side.

00:01:48.611 --> 00:01:52.694
Equals two e to the minus
t over one millisecond.

00:01:54.795 --> 00:01:57.038
And you can see it starts at two volts

00:01:57.038 --> 00:01:59.856
and then sags down as we predicted,

00:01:59.856 --> 00:02:02.661
and that's an exponential curve.

00:02:02.661 --> 00:02:04.734
And then over here on this side,

00:02:04.734 --> 00:02:07.347
i, as we said before, starts out at zero

00:02:07.347 --> 00:02:10.471
in the capacitor, the current
in the capacitor is zero,

00:02:10.471 --> 00:02:12.881
and as soon as we throw open that switch,

00:02:12.881 --> 00:02:17.281
the charge charges over
through the resistor

00:02:17.281 --> 00:02:20.364
and this is the equation here, i of t

00:02:22.257 --> 00:02:24.507
equals two volts over 1,000

00:02:27.438 --> 00:02:29.688
e to the minus t over RC or

00:02:36.021 --> 00:02:37.938
t over one millisecond.

00:02:43.425 --> 00:02:45.706
So this is what we call
the natural response

00:02:45.706 --> 00:02:48.257
of an RC circuit, and you'll run into this

00:02:48.257 --> 00:02:51.507
in almost every circuit you ever build.
