00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:15.200
[Archive audio] Today men first left the protective
atmosphere of Earth to walk in the vacuum

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.660
of the moon.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.019
And we may wonder -
will our lives ever be the same?

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:31.820
Will future generations look back on the Earth
from another planet, from another star?

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.400
And say this was the beginning.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.720
[Narration] The year is 1961.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.800
The space race is in full swing and the
Soviet Union is enjoying a comfortable lead.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.400
Under mounting political pressure in the United
States,

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.190
the freshly elected 35th president John F.
Kennedy

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.330
stands before congress in 1961 and he declares

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.950
that they will put a man on the
moon before the decade is through.

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:14.870
[Archive audio, JFK] For while we cannot guarantee
that we shall one day be first,

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:20.170
we can guarantee that any failure
to make this effort will make us last.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.340
[Narration] It was an ambitious project and even NASA
itself wasn’t sure they could do it by 1970.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.620
In 1963 Kennedy even came close to
agreeing a joint Soviet-American mission

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.880
to the moon to avoid duplication of effort.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.880
[Archive audio, JFK] Space offers no problems of sovereignty.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.720
Why, therefore, should man's first flight
to the moon be a matter of national competition?

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.880
[Narration] Despite this, NASA was undaunted
and remained committed to its quest.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.740
How to approach the moon
was one of the first big questions.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.960
Could you directly fly a spaceship there,
go out for a wander and then zip back to Earth?

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.860
Or did you need something a little bit more elaborate?

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.169
The option finally chosen
was that of a Lunar Orbit Rendezvous.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.980
This meant that a ship would launch from Earth,
and stay in orbit around the Moon,

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.000
while a smaller craft, a lunar landing module,
descends to the lunar surface.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.160
The same lander would then ascend
to bring the astronauts back to the mothership.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.319
This method had the added benefit of
being able to use the lunar module as a lifeboat,

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:34.079
a feature that came very handy when the oxygen
tank exploded aboard Apollo 13.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.420
By 1967, following nearly twenty unmanned
missions,

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.060
equipment improvements and nerve wracking
delays,

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.630
NASA was ready to launch the first
three Apollo astronauts to space:

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.660
Gus Grissom, Ed White and Roger Chaffee.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.660
But Apollo 1 would never make it’s launch
date.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.870
Disaster struck when during a training exercise

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.290
a fire broke out in the cockpit and all three
men perished.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.840
16 months later, after numerous changes to
spacesuit

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:08.959
and spaceship design, and three unmanned missions,

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.200
NASA was again in a position to restart manned
missions.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.520
Apollo 7 tested equipment in Earth orbit and
quickly thereafter

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.430
Apollo 8 became the first lunar orbiting mission,

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.670
sending pictures of the moon surface to Earth
via a live broadcast on Christmas Eve 1968.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.140
[Archive audio] This is Apollo 8 
coming to you live from the moon.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:35.600
I know my own impression is that it’s
a vast, lonely, forbidding type.

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.840
[Narration] NASA got ever closer to its goal 
with each mission

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.340
and then finally on June 20th, 1969, 
Apollo 11 made history

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.550
by landing the first two humans on the moon.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.980
[Archive audio] The Eagle has landed.
- Roger. Twink.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.320
Tranquility we copy you on the ground.

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.320
You’ve got a bunch of guys about to turn
blue.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.540
We’re breathing again. Thanks a lot.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.600
[Narration] Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin took
those first steps on an alien landscape,

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.400
watched over by their third teammate Michael Collins

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:07.120
who was watching with anticipation 
from the orbiting mothership.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:14.020
[Arcive audio] It's one small step for man, 
one giant leap for mankind.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:25.520
[Narration] A further 10 men set foot on the surface
of the moon during the subsequent Apollo missions.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.080
Altogether, the Apollo astronauts spent tens
of hours

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.100
on the lunar surface, collecting hundreds
of pounds

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.380
of rock and soil samples, and taking thousands
of photos.

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.910
The United States claimed
the victor’s crown in the space race,

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.310
but the effects of the program
reverberated throughout the world.

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.300
[Archive audio] The excitement of the mission, the tension and drama of the splashdown,

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.400
they remain only in our memories

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:54.230
and in time they'll be replaced in the future
by other missions, other memories.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.240
The moments of Apollo may be over
but the understanding and the discovery,

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.460
they go on.

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:07.720
And the full meaning, the real meaning,
may yet be in the future too.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:13.910
But for now, for the present, the images
and the sounds provide meaning enough,

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:18.070
to each in his own way,
and to each in his own time.
