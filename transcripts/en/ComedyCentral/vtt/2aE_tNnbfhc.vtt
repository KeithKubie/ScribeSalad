00:00:01.534 --> 00:00:05.705
In our research we've found that
humans go through a period of
change.

00:00:05.738 --> 00:00:08.074
Right around the age of puberty.

00:00:08.107 --> 00:00:09.475
Woooowwwww.

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:13.679
You guys are really doing some
ground breaking work here aren't
ya.

00:00:13.712 --> 00:00:16.883
First they start being rude and
sarcastic.

00:00:16.916 --> 00:00:18.651
Then they try to fit in.

00:00:18.684 --> 00:00:20.720
By giving up the very quirks and
interests.

00:00:20.753 --> 00:00:22.455
That make them who they are.

00:00:22.488 --> 00:00:23.256
Next thing you know

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:25.591
They're all just dreamless
husks.

00:00:25.624 --> 00:00:27.627
Stumbling blind toward the
grave.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.130
Like a bunch of sad lonely
ghosts.

00:00:31.163 --> 00:00:32.398
Jesus!

00:00:32.431 --> 00:00:34.500
Look what would have happened to
your favorite cultural heroes.

00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:36.736
If they'd given up on their
dreams.

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:38.871
You ever heard of Drizzy drake?

00:00:38.904 --> 00:00:41.574
We started from the bottom.

00:00:41.607 --> 00:00:42.909
Now where here.

00:00:42.942 --> 00:00:44.177
Which is very alarming I might
add.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.446
Oh God not the 6 man!

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:48.614
There's more.

00:00:48.647 --> 00:00:49.982
 ♪ Hello ♪

00:00:50.015 --> 00:00:51.784

satisfied.

00:00:53.452 --> 00:00:55.488
