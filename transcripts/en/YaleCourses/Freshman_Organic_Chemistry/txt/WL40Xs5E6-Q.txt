Speaker 1:          00:01          Okay, let's get started. So last time we looked at uh, methane and ammonia and saw something interesting about molecular orbitals, we could give them the same name as atomic orbitals. That is, if we, and especially if we look at a low electron density contour of the molecular orbitals, we see that what it looks like is an Adam where the nucleus is split into pieces right now that splitting into pieces dis changes the potential energy for the electron. So you expect that to distort the orbital. The electrons will move in the directions that pieces of the nucleus of gone. But then in addition to potential energy control in the shape of orbitals, kinetic energy also does, and that's the same thing as it is in an Adam. You have a thing with no nodes thing with one node a and when you have one node, you can have either a spherical node or a planer node, and the plane, there can be three planar nodes.

Speaker 1:          01:08          So two s and three two p's. You have the same, the same, exactly the same considerations apply in a molecular orbitals and atomic orbital. You have the kinetic energy, which comes with curvature, which comes with nodes. Now as you split the, the nucleus up and pull pieces in different directions, it doesn't have the same symmetry it had when it was all together in the nucleus as spherical kind of symmetry. So the nodes get distorted, but still you can see them there. And we saw them last time and went through all the occupied and vacant valence orbitals of ammonia and methane and saw how they looked like atomic orbitals. This not surprisingly, because it's so fundamental, the potential energy to kinetic energy applies to every system. It applies to you, viewed as a single atom, right? With a Zillion electrons. Okay. But anyway, but pieces of moved around.

Speaker 1:          02:02          So the, so the orbitals change, we'll look at a more at two more complicated cases and then we'll get onto a different way of looking at bonding. So we'll look at ethane and methanol and we use, uh, W I didn't tell you last time explicitly where I got the molecular orbitals from. I got them from my laptop. There's a program, that particular one is called Spartan that I use. And it, it calculates what molecular orbitals look like using approximate molecular orbital. That is, uh, uh, Schrodinger equation kind of theory. Okay? So let's just look at the ones of ethane and methanol. Now, both of these have seven pairs of valence electrons. There are also a core electrons. And if we were looking at the orbitals for all the electrons, we didn't include those and exactly how we're going to, uh, count those. You could do it one way or the other, whether you consider the core electrons, the one that's electrons, just be part of the nucleus and then treat the rest as the electrons you're interested in, or whether you, uh, whether you want to count the core electrons to, you can do it either way.

Speaker 1:          03:08          But what you analogize, the what depends on whether you count them as part of the Nuclei airport. It's only how we're going to compare these molecular orbitals to the atomic orbitals of are gone, which has also seven electron pairs. Okay? So, so there's, uh, the two s orbital. I'm going to start with that because, because I'm going to pretend that that red part is the core, that there's, there's a one s which is core electrons. But in this case, here's my pedantic note on this subject, which I just added. So if you have to, before we had just one heavy Adam carbon and methane nitrogen in ammonia, right? So there was one, one s orbital. Right now we have two heavy atoms, carbon and carbon, and methane, carbon and oxygen, and methanol. So they're too heavy atoms and therefore to a boring core orbitals. So for purposes of making analogies, we'll use the atomic one s orbital, uh, of the Adam that were analogizing things to, to stand for all the molecular core orbitals.

Speaker 1:          04:13          You can do it any way you want to. We're not really interested in that. We're interested in the valence Arbuckle. So whether I start with the one s or the two s depends on how I'm handling the core electrons is not a big deal. Anyhow, let's pretend it's the two s of Argon here and we're going to compare it with this lowest valence level molecular orbital of, uh, of ethane. Now we can wrote, as I do this on the left side of the, of the pictures, I'm going to show one view and then because it's more complicated than a methane and methane and ammonia, where I'm going to also show a picture rotated by 90 degrees. So I'm going to rotate around that axis. And on the right I'll show a different view of the same orbital. Okay? So that's the lowest valence level molecular orbital of ethane.

Speaker 1:          05:02          And it's not very exciting. It's just a distorted sphere. And you can see the way in which is the store to this distorted vertically because the two carbons are pulled apart. So it's got sort of a narrow waist to it. And then it's pulled out where each of the protons, uh, left the Middle Adam to, to come out and, and be hydrogens. Okay. Now if we look at, at a methanol, it'll be a little different. Can you anticipate how it might be different if on the bottom we'll have ch three again, but on the top instead of having ch three we're going to have o h. How do you think it might be different in the way it looks?

Speaker 2:          05:42          It might be skewed more towards the, Ooh, Jesus.

Speaker 1:          05:47          Okay, so oxygen has a bigger nuclear charge, so that's going to pull the lowest energy orbital toward the oxygen. That'll be one thing. We expect it to be big, bigger, a top heavy. Okay. What else about how the top, we'll look. How will it be different from if it were a ch three yeah, I can't hear very well. Oxygen has lone pairs. Now how is that going to change thing or another way of saying the same thing as has only one hydrogen up there. How's that going to change it do you think? Can speak, you have to speak up. It's not going to be a symmetrical. Which way is it going to be distorted? To be unsymmetrical, you have to speak up toward the electron pair to just say, I couldn't hear away from hydrogen. Well, how about the Proton goes out? Does it bring electrons with it or does it repel electrons?

Speaker 1:          06:43          The Proton speak up. It pulls. So it should distort toward the hydrogen. So here's what it looks like, right? The top, it's top heavy, as Angela said, and it's distorted out toward the hydrogen. There are no protons pulling it to the top left. And you see the same thing end on there at the, uh, on the right. Uh, okay. This is the next door battle. What does that look like? Obviously you can peak in the middle and see, it's obviously a two PZ orbital with the node across the middle. Okay. In both cases, now the, the, the ethane cases symmetrical, the other cases unsymmetrical. Why is it unsymmetrical? Because the first orbital pull the electrons to the top, right? So the next in the next door battle, electrons aren't going to want to be at the top so much because they're going to be repelled by the other electron.

Speaker 1:          07:37          So there'll be more toward the bottom because the first ones went to the top. Okay. Uh, okay. Then here's, here's a, here's the next door. But you can see there their energies marching up here. The lowest one was asked then to PCT and how to p x a law if we define the horizontal axis here on the left is the x axis. So again, it's what you expect and it's pulled out stretched vertically from being a dumb bell by where the nuclei went. Uh, and here's a two p y which we can see more clearly on the right perpendicular to the two px. Okay. And, um, notice obvious that it's obviously so that the, the methanol orbital will be less symmetric in all cases than the one for, for ethane. But still we can recognize the nodes because they must go that way. It must be a no nodes, one node of three different kinds and so on.

Speaker 1:          08:37          Okay. Now this is three s you notice it has the node that we don't see the one that's down near the nuclei, right? In fact, two nodes down near the nuclei, one for each of the heavy atoms, but then this now has another, uh, spherical or approximately spherical nodes. So we have that extra red lump in the middle. On the top. We're blue in the middle. Just just to review. What's the difference between red and blue on the top of the computer decided to draw it with red in the middle on the bottom and decided to draw it with blue in the middle. What do, what do those colors mean? Yeah, Kathy. They mean positive and negative. So which one is right? Should it be positive in the middle or negative in the middle.

Speaker 1:          09:28          Positive as a guest. Wilson would you say why not? Not really positive or negative. It's just a different phase. Yeah, it's, it's the sign of the wave function, but you can multiply the wave function by minus one any constant and it's just as good as bad as before. So it's arbitrary and the computer was arbitrary and choosing the colors. Okay. I think there's actually a function that I could've changed that if I had thought to do so. So they'd be the same. But actually it tells a story if I leave them different. Okay. So here's, here's the next one. Now this is, if you look on the left, now it's more clear where the nodes are that that's a d, F, z orbital. The name x z means that the product of x and z appears in the wave function, right? So when both x and z are positive, then the product is positive on the top right?

Speaker 1:          10:23          Red, right when the, when x is negative and Z as positive, the top left, it's negative, the product. So that's why, that's why it has the name x, Z. Okay? And there's D, Y, Z, which you see on the right turn 90 degrees. And here's the Dz squared, which is that thing that has a donut that goes around the middle, right? What? It's hard to see the donut. Can you see it? It's blue on top. You can easily see the red on the top left, which is the what's blue in the middle, right? The sign has changed, right? But the doughnut is highly distorted because as you go around first, Proton on the top pulls it up than a proton in the bottom, pulls it down, then up down. So it's like a crown. That donut has been made into a crown around the end, right by the protons pulling it that way.

Speaker 1:          11:15          Okay. Then here's a the the three peasy. So it has the horizontal nodal plane, but also it has a spherical node, which you can see in either picture. Really. Okay. Then here's the three p why orbital, which again has that spherical node, but now the Planar node or approximately planar node is vertical instead of horizontal. So that, so let's say on the top right there, you have red on the right and blue on the left, there's a vertical node over which changes sign going right to left. Or here's the three p x, or here's the three d x, y, which you don't see so well here, a o l a but if you turned it down you would, and here's the three d x squared minus y squared, which again, to see it, well you have, you'd have to turn it and here's the four f orbital.

Speaker 1:          12:14          So you can see, especially say on the in the top ones compared with the atomic orbital that it's exactly the same general pattern of nodes, slightly distorted. And incidentally, the, the uh, member, all the n equals whatever n equals three. All the orbitals had the same energy before. Now they don't have all the same energy. Notice that they all have different energies. None of them are degenerate. Why? Because that if you broke the nucleus apart, how stable a thing that has that general shape, like a dumbbell or a cloverleaf or something, how stable the electrons are in those, in those lumps depends on whether a proton got pulled into the lump. If there happens to be a proton in the lump where kinetic energy, the node pattern wants it to be, then that'll be unusually stable. If the protons had been pulled someplace where there is a node because of kinetic energy, then it won't be stabilized.

Speaker 1:          13:15          So that breaks the degeneracy of these different, different patterns that have the same number of nodes. That depends on where the, how the potential energy changed. Okay. Now, just finally and very quickly, I want to look at one flouro ethanol, which is a molecule that would have, I think, no stability at all, but you can put it into the, I mean, as a practical matter, you're never going to put it in a bottle, but you can easily put it into the computer and calculate what its molecular orbitals would look like. And I did it to show you something that's very, very unsymmetrical and has Adam's a very different nuclear charge. Okay, so what will the very, very, very lowest orbital look like, do you think? For this thing, it has, uh, a fluorine and oxygen, two carbons and five hydrogens. So what do you, if you were an electron and you had that set of nuclei arranged this way, where would you want to go, Elizabeth?

Speaker 1:          14:11          Very nice. The left, especially around the three. Now, what would the very, very, very lowest, and it should be more toward the left and, and really close to the flooring. It would be a one s orbital and mostly on fluorine because that's where most of the protons are, the most concentrated Proton. So let's look, there's, there's a smaller scale ball model so that we can see really small orbitals and there that's, you're absolutely right. It's the one s or it's essentially the one s orbital. A fluorine is the very lowest orbital. What would be next if you were suppose this was, you came up in, this seat was already taken. Now where would you go? The next electron, Zack. Oxygen to the oxygen cause that's the next highest concentration of protons. And next, where are we going next? Steve, what do you say that the one s of fluorine has taken? The one s of oxygen is taken. Where are we want to go next?

Speaker 2:          15:14          Pardon me. Oh, which carbon? Why

Speaker 1:          15:23          and what does the proximity have to do with it? That the proximity means that the, the, that the electrons that are on, that Adam will have been drawn toward, and we'll talk about this more later. We'll have been drawn toward the fluorine and the oxygen, therefore that Adam will have fewer electrons are lower electron density. Right? Therefore, it's a better place for other electrons to go. Okay. So you'd expect the next one to be the middle of carbon. Right. And finally, of course, it's going to be the second carbon, the one that's remote from the electronegative high nuclear charge Adams. Okay. Now, now we've done all the one ss, so we can look at what's interesting, the valence or, but also the ones that are going to be involved in bonding. These don't have anything to do with bonding. Okay. So there's the first one. Does, uh, uh, uh, Russell told me something about the shape of this. Does it surprise you?

Speaker 1:          16:23          Yeah, it has no nodes except it actually has little nodes down near the nucleus cause it's actually more like a two s orbital in that respect. Okay. Because of the core electrons. So it has tiny nodes that we don't see around the nuclei, but it has no nodes within the valence big orbitals that we're looking at. So it's like an s orbital. Right. And it's big where the, where the nuclear charge as big as you say. Okay. What's the next one? Gonna look like? Any ideas? Pardon me? Toward the oxygen. Will it also have no nodes? No. The next highest orbital has to have a node. Where do you think the node will be? What orbital would that look like? Sort of, it'll be highly distorted. But what if this is the s orbital? Right? What's gonna be next?

Speaker 2:          17:25          Oh, Elizabeth.

Speaker 1:          17:27          It's as if it switched. But with the Planar node. Let's see. Right, right. So the first one was, you were right, Russell, that this one should be big on oxygen, but notice that, hey, it's like a p orbital. It has that horizontal node because it's higher kinetic energy. Okay. And then this one that's on the carbons, right? Mostly, but it's a p why it has a vertical node. Right? So it's negative, say on the fluorine and oxygen and positive on the carbons. Or if we rotate this one around a horizontal access to look at it from the side, it looks like that. And you can see that it's a p y kind of orbital.

Speaker 2:          18:06          Well, Elizabeth, technically pure business, right? We are. We're just saying there are, now

Speaker 1:          18:13          there are analogous to p orbitals because it has to be the same. The orbitals must go in order of the number of nodes, right? So the same thing as in an Adam or into molecule. You go from no nodes to one node and there are three ways of getting one node spherical or distorted sphere planes or distorted planes if the nuclei are pulled around, so on. So they're, they're really very much likely atomic orbitals. Okay. Or this one. Now that's an interesting one because that's like a hybrid orbital. It looks like the orbital up here. It's a mixture of s with p. Everybody see how that is. It's a big sort of blue lobe on the top and a small red wood on the bottom. And also the next one is the other one, the hybrid that points the other direction. Another combination of the s and p that points down. Okay. And then this one, it looks like d x, y again, right? It's sort of a cloverleaf with two nodes.

Speaker 1:          19:14          Okay. So that's all I want to do with that and we won't go any further with it. This is just an interesting way of looking at how, how molecular molecular orbitals are really just like atomic orbitals and have energies for the same reason, except the potential energy gets screwed up by breaking the nucleus and pulling pieces around, but in an understandable way. And the, the nodes get distorted because of this. Okay. Now, uh, now we're getting into really the w w we just looked at this view of at the single United atom view, but the other view is the one that's going to be more generalizable. And that's the one where we looked at bonding, right? So you have to probe a little harder to get a qualitative understanding of what chemical bonds are. And that's where we're going to do now by choosing a higher contour it with which to look at a molecule. Now, true molecular orbitals, to the extent that orbitals are true altogether, why aren't they true altogether? Why aren't orbitals true altogether?

Speaker 2:          20:18          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          20:21          Does he have many electrons? You can't have independent electrons, right? You can't have orbitals but we're approximating thing by orbitals trying to take or electron interaction into account in a sort of a lefthanded way by self-consistent field or something like that. Because it's much easier if we can divide the whole into a bunch of parts, each of which we can understand. So to the extent that molecular orbitals are true, the kinds of things I've just been showing you calculated with laptop, uh, they extend over the whole molecule. They're not local, right? Except like the one s of fluorine was local, right? But mostly they're there go over the whole molecule. But bonds are thought of and has have always been thought of as interaction between pairs of Adams. So we want to divide things completely differently. And look at the bonds now at Pairwise Llc, a Oh molecular orbitals.

Speaker 1:          21:19          Now what's an Lca? Oh, it's a sum or a linear combination, right? A weighted sum of atomic orbitals. So here's an example, PSI, which is an orbital. What's that? A function of position of what? One Electron. So it's a function of x one y one Z one we're talking just about electron one. So the wave function for electron one we say is one over the square root of two times one atomic orbital plus another atomic orbital right? Now, have you ever seen adding orbitals like that before? That's what hybridization is. We added an s and P, but this is different because when we added SNP before, they were on the same nucleus and we did it to get a new orbital for that particular nucleus for that Adam, right to distort it one way or the other, for example, or to rotate a p orbital. Right? But this is very different because we're adding orbitals that are on different nuclei. A nucleus, a a nucleus. Be. See the difference adding is just the way functions are numbers. We just add the numbers. But in the first case, hybridization, those two functions were on the same nucleus. Now they're on different nuclei. What? We're heading together. Okay. Now why is it sensible to think that you might get pairwise molecular orbitals that can be expressed like this? How do you interpret an orbital Corey? What good is an orbital? What do you use it for?

Speaker 2:          23:04          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          23:05          but what? So what do you use it for?

Speaker 2:          23:08          Great.

Speaker 1:          23:10          And how do you get probability from the wave function? You have the wave function. How do you get the probability density? You Square it. So do you see why we have a one over the square root of two in this plus when we square it, that's going to be a half and we're going to get a half of atomic orbital, a squared and of atomic orbital B squared. So it's a half of each of them. That's why they have the one over the square root of two. So let's, let's go on with this. Suppose we have a hydrogen molecule and suppose that the nuclei at a great distance from one another so far, they don't interact or negligible interaction. They're very far apart. What would you expect the one elect the lowest energy, one electron wave function to look like? The one possibility is that the electron could sit exactly halfway between the two nuclei. Right. Is that a reasonable place? Is that the low energy place for it to be? Lucas, what'd he say?

Speaker 2:          24:17          The attic probability density there is not the greatest thing.

Speaker 1:          24:19          Why not? Why shouldn't the electron sit? Right? It's the two nuclei are this far apart. And I don't mean to angst terms apart. I mean two meters apart. There's a proton here in a proton here. Is the electron most likely to be here and halfway between? No. Where would it be most likely rolling year to one of the two atoms. And which of the two,

Speaker 1:          24:43          suppose you took the long view, suppose you averaged it over, uh, 18 zillion millennia time average. Sometimes it would be near this one. Sometimes it would be near this one. Okay. What would it be if you took a really long view? Both and half here and half here. So the wave function, when you square it, you want it to be half looking like this Adam and half looking like this, Adam. Then you see the time average, right? It might take a long time to achieve that average because it take a long time for the electron to tunnel two meters. Right? But in the very, very long time it would look like that. So we know what we want it to look like. What we want is that the probability density, the square of this one electron wave function should look half of the time, like the atomic orbital, a squared and half of the time like atomic orbital B squared. So on time average, it's half of one and half of the other. Everybody with me? So that's what the s yeah, Nate. Well, because I'm telling you what it looks like. It's got to look half like this and half like this, right? So the square of it has to be this. So all we have to do to find the wave function is what if we know what square is? All we got to do is take the square root and we've got the wave function. Bingo. There's the square root,

Speaker 1:          26:19          right? So that is a reasonable way to write the wave function. One over the square root of two times atomic orbital, Aa plus atomic orbital be clarity. You have a question?

Speaker 2:          26:38          Just like a bracket is two things. Inside the sprouts you have four things that come out of distributing 100 you can't just put the squares.

Speaker 1:          26:53          Okay, now Clara, you're going to help me out. How big is that? That's a number. It's the product of a top. What? Atomic orbital a assigns numbers everywhere in space. Everywhere in space. Atomic orbital be assigns numbers everywhere in space. So at some point in space, atomic orbital be assigns a number and atomic orbital a assigns a number and a times B is the product of those two numbers. How big is that product? How big is atomic orbital? A here? This a meter away from the Proton. Great. And how, how big is the atomic orbital be there? Great. Now how big is atomic orbital a here? Great. Okay, so now how big an error do we make if we neglect a times B, where do we make an error? Do we make an error here? Do we make an error here? Do we make an error here? Yes. No, we make an error. Yeah, sure enough, we make an error. How big is the error? Uh, it's, it's negligible. Does, it's a great distance. Okay, so at great distance we can forget that. So now it's easier to take the square root, right?

Speaker 2:          28:18          Okay.

Speaker 1:          28:19          The Old Fox up here, Huh?

Speaker 2:          28:24          Okay.

Speaker 1:          28:25          Okay. Now your problem is what happens if h two is that the bonding distance, what if they're only an onstream apart? Now there should be a problem, right? Because because a times B is not going to be negligible everywhere. Now, okay, so now that's going to come back. So now we got an error, right? Or do we? Let's think what that does. Okay, so if we approximate the molecular orbital as a sum of atomic orbitals this way, then it looks very good near the nuclei because near a, it looks like a near B, it looks like B. And if we want a square it to find the electron density we do at this at. But if we then subtract what the Adams would give for electron density, now what does this remind you of where we look at the total electron density and subtract the Adams?

Speaker 1:          29:28          This. So we're actually looking for the difference density. Everybody with me on this. So we're going to subtract the Adams, which is one half a squared and a half B squared, right? If we subtract, what do we get? What we get for a difference density, we get a times B. So we get the difference. Electron density, which is due to overlap. And what do I mean by overlap? I mean that is only important in regions where both of them have a finite value, right? The product of a and B is negligible. If a is zero, it's negligible. If B is very, very small, right? So it's only where they overlapped, the two functions have simultaneous values that you care, okay? Now that thing, the thing that's that the bonding, the difference, density is really a byproduct. That's a little bit of a pun because it's a product, right? But it's a byproduct of squaring the sum of what player didn't like about it. So the very thing you didn't like is what's going to give rise to bonding density in that. Neat.

Speaker 1:          30:43          Okay? But notice that here we're multiplying a times B, but this is completely different instance of multiplying from what we had before. Right? Before we multiplied two orbitals to try to get a two electron wave function. This has nothing to do with this because both of these are functions of the same electron. It's like one electron that we're squaring here that so this a times B, this product is overlap comes from the squaring. It was when we squared it that we got that. Okay. Now, because we have this extra term, we have not only one, half a squared plus B squared, which would sell, what would the probability of that, what's the probability of a squared summed over all space or integrated if it's normalized and this one and what's this whole quantity one because of the half, but actually we've got bigger than that, right?

Speaker 1:          31:40          Because we added the overlap term to it, right? So it's actually not going to be a half. It'll have to be something a little less than a half. So that will sum up to one if we want to normalize it. Okay, so they're going to be those less than a half's there. Okay. Now what does that do? That shifts electron density, right? We're taking electron density away from where the nuclei are from a square and be square, and where is the electron density going? Because we're using less than a half to begin with, right? We're taking electron density away. There's going to be, we're subtracting more than was there at the beginning, right? Which means that we're going to have negative electron density in the difference map. Electrons are going away from the Adams. Where are they going to?

Speaker 1:          32:29          Into the region where there's overlap, right? So they go away from there into the overlap region. So this is just like what we were seeing with X-ray. Okay? So that overlap the a times B term is what creates bonding. And we've seen this before. Remember when you have wells far apart, the the wave function is a sum of the two. We saw this in one dimension, right? But if they come close together, you get a wave function that looks like that, which we looked before just from the point of view of the energy and saw that that would stabilize the particle because it's got less curvature, less kinetic energy, right? But also the electron density grows in the middle, right? So from the point of view of the electron distribution, that was whole. That was the glue holding the atoms together. So it's held together both because the energy goes down and because you put this glue in the middle, which is what causes the energy to go down.

Speaker 1:          33:27          Okay? So that's bonding. And remember we also had this, so as the energy went up in the middle, when the energy is lower here than it was in the atoms apart. So you the the, so the nuclei push one another apart. Now without the glue in the middle. And that was anti-bonding. So we've seen it before in one dimension, but it's true in three dimensions as well. Now let's think about this again. So here's, here's a, here's Adam a. Now, where is the square of that function significant? Is that significant there? No. Is it, is it significant there? Yeah, it's a little bit significant. At least there's, how about there?

Speaker 2:          34:09          A little bit, right? Okay.

Speaker 1:          34:13          Now suppose we have another atomic orbital there. Now where is the product significant of a Times B. Okay. So is the product a times B significant there?

Speaker 2:          34:27          No. Uh, is it significant there? Nick? What do you say? Why not

Speaker 1:          34:43          speak up small? What's very small? The value of a no, no. The value of a, there is something we said that before when we were looking only a day. It's not very big, but there's a significant value. But how about the product, Josh? The value of B is very small there. So the product is going to be very small. How about, how about there? Oh, now they're equal in there halfway between their equal. So both of them are a little bit small, but their product is still significant. Right? Only in this region where they overlap. Is that product significant? Okay. So at the center notice that a, the Cya, the numbers, Cya signs and the numbers. Ib Siberia signs are the same number. So two times CYA CIB is as large as CIA squared plus diabetes, right? Cause CIA time CIB is the same as Cya squared.

Speaker 1:          35:42          So the electron density is nearly doubled in the middle from what it would have been if it had just been to Adams. So that's the region of significant overlap and that's what we care about. So the overlap, integral, summing this product or integrating it over all that space, that's a certain density, right, that we squared in order to get that right. That's part of the density. So we some that did the density that comes from that product overall, uh, space, and that's called the overlap integral. If the atoms are very far apart, the overlap integral is essentially zero. If the Adams are close together, the overlap orbital will be finite. And the better the, the, the more the orbitals overlap, the bigger the overlap integral obviously. So that and that majors, the net change that arises on bonding the difference density as we've just seen.

Speaker 1:          36:37          Now, let's look at some, some practical exam or not with some theoretical examples here. So let's look at, uh, at, uh, uh, the total electron density as calculated for two w adding two, one s orbitals of hydrogen at the appropriate distance for h two, right? This was done 40 years ago and published in the Israel journal a chemistry. Okay. Now, and here's, so on the left, we have the total electron density that you'd calculate from that very simple thing. One over the square root of two a squared, a plus B, one of the squares do a plus B, and you square it, you get the density, and that's the density contour debt 0.025 electrons per cubic, uh, uh, uh, a zero the unit of distance. Okay. Now on the right is the difference density. So from that thing on the left, we've subtracted the atomic orbitals, the atomic electron densities, and you see exactly what you expect. It builds up in the middle where there's overlap and it at the expense of the Adams. You know, Russell?

Speaker 1:          37:42          Oh, uh, I think it's the h two molecule. I'm sure. I'm sure it's the age too. I'm, they aren't so fantastically different because the two electrons are in the same orbital. Two electrons can be in the same orbital, so one will be twice as big as the other. Qualitatively, they'll look very similar. And I think this is the h two molecule, but it might be the eye on, I'm not sure. Okay. Uh, at any rate, the contours on the right are much smaller. Remember, different density is much smaller than total density. So what you see is that it's contoured at 0.04. So you have one, two, three, four, five contours. So you get up in the middle to 0.02 electrons per cubic [inaudible]. That's how much bonding has changed things at the maximum. Okay. Now the energy that's calculated with this very, very, very crude wave function, just one half, one of the square to two times the sum of the two atomic orbitals, the energy you calculate that is 92.9% of the true energy. That's pretty darn good, right? But almost all of that energy that you calculate was already present in the separate atoms, were not interested in the energy of the separate atoms, were interested in how much it changes when you make a bond, which is a small difference between large numbers. So it turns out that although we're within 7% of the true total energy, this simple model only calculates about 50% of the change in energy that came from putting them together, right? Which is much smaller.

Speaker 1:          39:28          Okay, so high accuracy is required to calculate a correct value of the bond energy. The simple thing won't do it well. It gets, it's in the right direction. You're halfway there so it's pretty good start, right? But uh, to do the difference as in the same way you needed high precision to do Xra difference maps, you need better orbitals than this. If you want to calculate good bond energies, so you need to make the orbitals better. Okay. Now that, so, but already we can take heart that the very crude just model shows most 52% of the energy of the bond and it shows the electron density building up by 0.02 electrons per cubic bor radius. And what we saw qualitatively it was there was a shift from the Adam to the bond of electron density. Okay. Now we can adjust the molecular orbital to get a better approximation of the truth thing.

Speaker 1:          40:25          How will we know when we've adjusted it and it's gotten better if we adjust it and get a lower calculate, a lower average energy? I should have said the lower average energy because if we don't have a true way function, we get different values for the total energy. The kinetic won't exactly offset the potential as you move from place to place, but then if you get the lowest average energy, then that is by definition almost more realistic because you can easily prove that the true energy is the lowest possible energy that makes a certain amount of sense. The lowest possible calculated energy is the true energy. So if you change your wave function and get a lower average energy, you're closer to the truth. Okay? That's called the variational principal. Okay, so here, here we've changed the form of the wave molecular oracle and how did we change it? What is a one? What does a one s orbital look like? Kate, do you remember the form for a one s atomic orbital? I can't hear it. It's Angola. It's a sphere. How does it change as you go out? Do you remember? How does it depend on row?

Speaker 1:          41:40          The same way they all depend on row. Anybody remember either the minus row, so it falls off exponentially. At a certain rate and that rate, how fast it falls off is determined by the nuclear charge. Okay? Now, one way to change that shape would be change how fast it falls off, right? It wouldn't be correct for the Adam anymore. We've already got the correct solution for the atom, but we could change the shape of the thing by changing that x, the how fast that exponent falls off. And we could have very that in the molecule using one half, one of the square to, to a squared plus B, right? But those a plus B are no longer true atomic functions. There are a little fatter, a little skinnier, okay? And we can change how fat or skinny it is until we get the lowest molecular energy.

Speaker 1:          42:32          See that? That's a way you can vary it and find the best value. And that's what was done here to optimize the exponent. And now you've got a total electron density that looks essentially the same as it did before. And if you look at the difference density, how has it changed? If you do this first, notice that the energy got lower. We're now to 73% of the lowering of the bond energy. So the total energy has gotten lower, it's better. And how is the electron density changed? It got higher in the middle because what we did was spread the exponent out a little bit so you had more overlap in the middle. Okay, so this wouldn't have been good for the single atom to spread it out, but it gives a better function for the molecule and it's still very, very simple. And what you see it did is it increases the bonding density and the bonding strength.

Speaker 1:          43:27          You get a larger shift from the atoms to the bond. Now, how else could you change the shape of the atomic orbital in order to increase the overlap some way other than making a single exponential and having to get fatter or thinner? Can you think of some other way here? Or you have an atomic orbital a sphere and you want to change its shape so that it overlaps better over here, right? How could, how could you change the shape of an atomic orbital without doing really gross damage to it? Right. Making it a cube or something like that or align, how could you change it? So it looked pretty much still like an Adam did as a lot of the virtues of the atom. But it's shifted over here. Sam can't hear.

Speaker 1:          44:20          Yeah. How, how, how am I going to write a function that allows the electrons to shift in the direction I want them to. Lexi hybridize it. We could hybridize the shift the electron. So that's the next one. So uh, so here we're going to, instead of this, we're going to hybridize it now this particular calculation did the hybridization and also did a little self-consistent field calculation and the hybridization left at 96.7% one s so essentially it's still normal one s orbital, but they added 0.6% of two s which expanded it a little bit cause two ss goes further out than one s and they added 2.7% have to pee. Now why was there much but it was two p much more helpful than two s Lucas.

Speaker 1:          45:14          Yeah. So it takes density from one side and shifts it to the other. In fact, this is precisely what we saw before. Uh, um, notice what it, what it did was, uh, how much it includes increased the density in the middle and notice now it's not taking electron density away from the nuclei, which was a good place for electrons to be. Where does it take it away from out beyond the nuclei and shift it to the middle. So even before when it was an Adam and a certain, here's the nucleus, a certain distance out here and a certain distance out here, we're the same in energy for that, Adam. Now we've taken it from a place which is which out here and put it here. Right? Great idea. Well done Lexi. So there's what it looks like. You remember that's a 100% one s it looks like that.

Speaker 1:          46:10          And if you change it to be hybridized that way with Adam in a box, it looks like this, right? It's not much shift, but it shifts from the left to the right. Okay. And gives better overlap. Okay. And, and, uh, but it requires the Adam to be a little bit less happy as an Adam because it's, it's partly two s and two p. Now the electrons are further from the nucleus, but you make up for that by having a better bond, okay? Now notice that didn't change. The energy very much went from 73% to 76%, right? We were already about the right energy, but it changed the density a lot to be what we want it to be. Okay? So there's a much bigger shift and it's now from beyond the nucleus into the bond, right? Uh, and now we're going to do the last thing we've done SCF already, but now you have to do a higher level calculation.

Speaker 1:          47:08          That'll do correlation. Take the correlation of the electrons into account. And if you add some correlation calculation to this, you now get 97, 90% of the bond. If you did complete correlation, you'd get 100% of the bond. What does it mean to do a calculation with complete correlation? It means you don't have an error anymore. You've raised, used the really good calculation. So already at this level that was done 50 years ago, almost, uh, you get 90% of the bond and the bond density. Notice what about the electron density? It hasn't really changed all the, all that happened was that the electrons kept apart from one another, but the average density was the same. So, so already with just that hybridization, we got very close to the truth in electron distribution and three quarters of the way to the truth in how strong a bond is.

Speaker 1:          48:01          So not a bad approximation. So hybridization to give better overlap is a great thing. So the density wasn't changed, but you've got a much better energy. And how so? Because the electrons kept apart from one another. When you allow correlation. Okay, so here's a pairwise atomic orbital, less than one half the square w one of the square to two times a plus B. And you can use hybridized orbitals. And the virtues are, it's very easy to formulate it to understand. And it looks like Adam's, especially when you get down near the nuclei, uh, and that you don't want that to change because that's the main event for electrons. You get much more energy forming Adams as we saw before than you do making, making new bonds once you have the Adams already. Uh, okay. It builds up electron density between the nuclei through overlap, which is the source of bonding.

Speaker 1:          48:55          It's smooth, smooth sy to lower the kinetic energy. And then there's a pedantic footnote here that actually there's a thing called the varial Theorem, which I'm not going to stress you with, but that's that little bit of there happens to be true, but still we have the proper I understanding of what's going on. Uh, hybridizing aos provides flexibility that gives you better overlap. And if you use all the h like atomic orbits, you have perfect flexibility. You could make any shape you want. Okay? But, but we're going to keep it simple. Use only s two s and two p orbitals to hybridize because that'll give you most of the way there. And it's much simpler rather than to try to mix five [inaudible] four bubbles into it also. Okay. So that's great. And when we square it, we get this, which has the overlap part that helps us out.

Speaker 1:          49:48          We have the Adams plus the bond, which is the overlap, that product part. Uh, but we could have done the same thing to get the same product as far as the Adam's go. If we'd used a minus sign instead of a plus sign and combining things, although then we would have changed the sign of the overlap thing, it would become minus. So we would change it from being greater than, less than to being greater than in order to have it be normalized at the bottom. Right. And that's the ante bonds. So we get both the bond and the anti bond, uh, by doing this. And now we're going to go on next time to overlap, which we've already introduced. And also the concept of energy match. And when you put these two together, you'll really understand bonding.
