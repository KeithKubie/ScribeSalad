00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.500
Earlier we had problems that will deal with sentences which have two verbs in

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:08.400
it. So here are two verbs, told and throw. Maria told Ben to throw the ball.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.960
How may an AI agent make sense of this particular sentence? So once again,

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.020
the processing starts on the left. Maria is not a verb,

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.570
so let's put in a concept list and for the time being ignore it.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.780
The processing goes to the second word which is told, which is a verb. And so

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.460
the primitive action calls when the told is pulled out. The primitive action is

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.400
speak, and so now we can start putting the fillers for the various slots. So

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.080
the agent is Maria and the result is now we go to the second one.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.440
Here the primitive action is propel because we have a throw here.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.260
And the propulsion is being done by Ben and the object is ball and now we

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.200
relate these two. This second frame is a result of the first frame's action. So,

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.240
if we go back to the previous sentence, Ashok enjoyed eating a frog.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:01.330
We can see how we can represent both verbs there in terms of action frames. So,

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:06.950
Ashok enjoyed. That might be the frame here. The primitive action is feel.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.940
The agent is Ashok. Ashok ate a frog, that's the primitive action of ingest,

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.670
agent is Ashok, and the object that got eaten was a frog.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.390
And the result of that is this frame where Ashok had a feeling of enjoyment.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.130
Note that some problems still remain. It is too difficult to

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.340
figure out exactly how represent a sentence like Ashok enjoyed eating a frog.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.976
It can be two representations with that particular sentence and

00:01:31.976 --> 00:01:34.365
see that those are two action frames or one action frame and

00:01:34.365 --> 00:01:38.480
one state of change frame. Some of these questions will get answered when we

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.490
stop thinking in terms of stories that are only one sentence long, but stories

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.660
that have a number of sentences. Stories based on a discourse. Because some of

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.635
these ambiguities will get resolved when we know more about what happened when

00:01:51.635 --> 00:01:55.442
Ashok enjoyed eating the frog. What came before it, or what came after it.
