weird flips or anything it's basically
 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.520 align:start position:0%
weird flips or anything it's basically
like<00:04:06.370><c> 95</c><00:04:06.970><c> percent</c><00:04:07.000><c> practical</c><00:04:07.900><c> and</c><00:04:08.080><c> for</c><00:04:08.440><c> that</c>

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 align:start position:0%
like 95 percent practical and for that
 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.890 align:start position:0%
like 95 percent practical and for that
