called "Digging Up Mother:

A Love Story."

00:01:26.652 --> 00:01:29.622
Foreword by Johnny Depp.

00:01:37.497 --> 00:01:40.300
There's a chick--
uh, a lady

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.603
I used to date
in the late '90s.

00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:45.171
She was out of my league.

00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:47.039

50 most beautiful
people in the world,

but not one of mine.

00:01:59.185 --> 00:02:01.320
But she was, uh--yeah,
she was out of my league.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.356
Bu--we had nothing in common.

00:02:03.356 --> 00:02:06.693
I don't know if you remember
the old Coach &amp; Horses.

00:02:06.693 --> 00:02:08.527
It's now called the Pikey.

00:02:08.527 --> 00:02:12.531
It was this shitty dive bar
down on Sunset,

00:02:12.531 --> 00:02:13.733
and that's where I hung out.

00:02:13.733 --> 00:02:15.201
I just lived there.

00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:19.371
Slumped over with
my seahorse posture at the bar

00:02:19.371 --> 00:02:23.710
and this fucking A-lister chick,

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.412
she was hanging out
with the Kennedys

00:02:26.412 --> 00:02:29.649
and going to dinner
with Rod Stewart,

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:31.083
and I'm not invited.

00:02:31.083 --> 00:02:33.819
I'm down fucking off
at the Coach &amp; Horses

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.889
with the schlubs and--

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:40.159
The relationship ended

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:43.696
where she had--
she took some crazy flight--

00:02:43.696 --> 00:02:46.666
"I'm going to the Cannes
Film Festival."

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:48.768
Really? Can I come?

00:02:48.768 --> 00:02:50.035
"No."

00:02:50.035 --> 00:02:53.339
And I know that she has
this big shot,

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:56.108

00:02:56.108 --> 00:02:59.878

what, I can't come, but you're--

00:03:01.513 --> 00:03:03.282
you're gonna be with that guy?

00:03:03.282 --> 00:03:05.518
And--and she came back,

00:03:05.518 --> 00:03:08.554
And the long version
is in the book.

00:03:08.554 --> 00:03:11.090
Doug Stanhope,
"Digging Up Mother,"

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.561
available now on Amazon.

00:03:17.263 --> 00:03:19.865
She comes back and she--

00:03:19.865 --> 00:03:20.933
I said,

00:03:20.933 --> 00:03:24.369
"So were you with that guy?"

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:26.639
And she goes, "Yeah, I saw him."

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.607
And I said,
"Did you fuck him?"

00:03:28.607 --> 00:03:31.277
I just cornered her.
Just said it.

00:03:31.277 --> 00:03:32.779
"Did you fuck him?"

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:35.981
And she said, "No."

00:03:35.981 --> 00:03:38.451
But then she continued on with,

00:03:38.451 --> 00:03:43.322
"But I gave him a blow job
in his car."

00:03:43.322 --> 00:03:46.792
You could have just stopped
after "No."

00:03:46.792 --> 00:03:49.328
Like, technically,
you wouldn't be lying.

00:03:49.328 --> 00:03:52.065
You wouldn't be
perjuring yourself.

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:55.602
You didn't have to give me
the blow job in the car.

00:03:55.602 --> 00:03:57.070
I can't tell you

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.272
who the guy is,

00:03:59.272 --> 00:04:03.609
but I'll tell you
what he does for a living.

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:06.245
He's the prince of [bleep].

00:04:06.245 --> 00:04:09.315
So I'll just leave it vague.

00:04:11.317 --> 00:04:12.752
That's not in the book,

00:04:12.752 --> 00:04:16.589
because the lawyers
wouldn't allow it.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:20.660
Now you know
the rest of the story.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.129
So I go out on--the--
you--

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:24.663
you get dumped like that,

00:04:24.663 --> 00:04:26.265
and you want to get
revenge pussy.

00:04:26.265 --> 00:04:28.433
Like, I'm gonna go
drop my dick

00:04:28.433 --> 00:04:30.669
into any vacant hole in town.

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:31.703
Fuck.

00:04:31.703 --> 00:04:36.175
But all my sewer grade options
were--

00:04:36.175 --> 00:04:40.646
They don't tally up with the
fucking prince of [bleep].

00:04:40.646 --> 00:04:42.782
Gonna fuck a Denny's waitress--

00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:44.784
No, you--

00:04:44.784 --> 00:04:46.486
So I--there used to--

00:04:46.486 --> 00:04:48.153
I don't know
if it still exists.

00:04:48.153 --> 00:04:50.289
There was a--
a club called The Union

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:52.724
down on Sunset,
and they did comedy.

00:04:52.724 --> 00:04:55.327
So I went down,
I had a show scheduled,

00:04:55.327 --> 00:04:58.897
I show up for an 8:00 show,
but they're late.

00:04:58.897 --> 00:05:00.966
They haven't unlocked the doors.

00:05:00.966 --> 00:05:02.568
So there's a group of people--

00:05:02.568 --> 00:05:06.706
I can put this book down now,
right, probably?

00:05:09.141 --> 00:05:11.977
The book, "Digging"--

00:05:11.977 --> 00:05:15.147
You get it.
You get it.

00:05:15.147 --> 00:05:17.883
So I'm outside of this club,

00:05:17.883 --> 00:05:22.187
waiting to go inside,
and--and they're closed.

00:05:22.187 --> 00:05:25.057
But there's a group of
people gathered,

00:05:25.057 --> 00:05:28.226
and, uh, there's a girl alone

00:05:28.226 --> 00:05:31.764
that was probably, to this day,

00:05:31.764 --> 00:05:33.933
the most beautiful woman

00:05:33.933 --> 00:05:35.901
I've ever seen in my life.

00:05:35.901 --> 00:05:40.573
"People" magazine wasn't there,
you know.

00:05:40.573 --> 00:05:42.407
And she asked me
for a cigarette,

00:05:42.407 --> 00:05:45.244
which triples the attraction.

00:05:45.244 --> 00:05:47.179
Like, a girl that hot

00:05:47.179 --> 00:05:50.049
that's not trying?

00:05:50.049 --> 00:05:51.249
Like, fuck yeah!

00:05:51.249 --> 00:05:52.418
She's not a Hollywood chick--

00:05:52.418 --> 00:05:54.387
this is an actual hot chick,

00:05:54.387 --> 00:05:56.055
and she bums a cigarette,

00:05:56.055 --> 00:05:58.424
and I start some small talk.

00:05:58.424 --> 00:06:01.227
I'm not good at it,
but I--I--

00:06:01.227 --> 00:06:03.629
Uh, what comic
are you here to see?

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:06.732
Hoping she doesn't say
the wrong name,

00:06:06.732 --> 00:06:09.101
'cause the last thing
that you want to hear

00:06:09.101 --> 00:06:13.606
is a fuckin' hot girl say she's
here to see a shitty comic.

00:06:13.606 --> 00:06:15.307
That would just
break your heart.

00:06:15.307 --> 00:06:19.445
So we have a repertoire.
We're talking.

00:06:19.445 --> 00:06:22.915
And we carry this inside
the bar when they open it,

00:06:22.915 --> 00:06:26.953
and we sit down, and she's
drinking whiskey straight,

00:06:26.953 --> 00:06:29.255
and matching me or better.

00:06:29.255 --> 00:06:30.623
For every beer I drink,

00:06:30.623 --> 00:06:32.959
she's a whiskey or two
ahead of me.

00:06:32.959 --> 00:06:35.294
And I'm--
this it the fucking--

00:06:35.294 --> 00:06:38.631
this is...perfect!

00:06:38.631 --> 00:06:41.967
And I didn't tell her
that I was a comedian

00:06:41.967 --> 00:06:43.402
or that I was doing the show.

00:06:43.402 --> 00:06:45.471
We're just sitting there
getting hammered,

00:06:45.471 --> 00:06:48.474
and drinking,
and I just waited

00:06:48.474 --> 00:06:50.676
till they announced my name,

00:06:50.676 --> 00:06:53.479
and then just, "Hey,
I'll be back in ten minutes.

00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:55.414
Just hold my seat."

00:06:55.414 --> 00:06:57.950
And I go up,
and I fucking destroyed.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:59.685
I just went, hey, hang on.

00:06:59.685 --> 00:07:02.154
I go--and then I go up,
I destroyed.

00:07:02.154 --> 00:07:04.256
It was like the scene
from "Anchorman"

00:07:04.256 --> 00:07:07.325
where he plays the jazz flute.

00:07:07.325 --> 00:07:09.028
And I just, "Oh, yeah, I'll..."

00:07:09.028 --> 00:07:10.997
And I fucking crushed.

00:07:10.997 --> 00:07:12.965
It was the best kill move.

00:07:12.965 --> 00:07:17.036
Came offstage, sat back down
at the bar beside her

00:07:17.036 --> 00:07:18.604
like nothing happened.

00:07:18.604 --> 00:07:20.773
So anyway, where were we?

00:07:20.773 --> 00:07:23.776
I'm not fucking smooth,
but I was--

00:07:23.776 --> 00:07:27.513
If I can't close this deal,

00:07:27.513 --> 00:07:30.549
I don't deserve the paper.

00:07:30.549 --> 00:07:32.517
So we're shit-faced,

00:07:32.517 --> 00:07:35.354
I bring her down
to the Coach &amp; Horses,

00:07:35.354 --> 00:07:38.857
which she loves,
unlike the girl that dumped me.

00:07:38.857 --> 00:07:41.694
Yeah, she's fuckin' all about
dive bars,

00:07:41.694 --> 00:07:45.631
and I introduce her
to all my friends there, and--

00:07:45.631 --> 00:07:49.701
quickly, 'cause I don't want
them to steal her.

00:07:49.701 --> 00:07:52.204
And we spend the night together,

00:07:52.204 --> 00:07:53.739
and, uh, at my apartment.

00:07:53.739 --> 00:07:56.375
I wake up to a--
a noncommittal,

00:07:56.375 --> 00:08:00.546
but nice note
with a phone number.

00:08:03.916 --> 00:08:05.885
And, um...

00:08:06.986 --> 00:08:09.188
Rebound pussy...

00:08:09.188 --> 00:08:13.192
Sometimes you cling to that

00:08:13.192 --> 00:08:15.561
with ten times the zeal

00:08:15.561 --> 00:08:17.997
of the relationship

00:08:17.997 --> 00:08:20.198
you're recovering from

00:08:20.198 --> 00:08:22.768
just for fear of an empty bed.

00:08:22.768 --> 00:08:25.237
I need you back.

00:08:25.237 --> 00:08:26.839
And it turns out she just--

00:08:26.839 --> 00:08:30.342
she was living three blocks
behind the Coach &amp; Horses

00:08:30.342 --> 00:08:32.945
and she became a regular

00:08:32.945 --> 00:08:34.846
at my bar.

00:08:34.846 --> 00:08:37.616
With everybody hitting on her.

00:08:37.616 --> 00:08:39.218
And I have no claim to that.

00:08:39.218 --> 00:08:41.587
Like, I fucked her once,
so she's like, "Yeah,

00:08:41.587 --> 00:08:43.088
"fucked you, nice to--

00:08:43.088 --> 00:08:46.792
Here's a note.
Fucked you. That was fun."

00:08:46.792 --> 00:08:48.894
So I--I don't have a claim,
but--

00:08:48.894 --> 00:08:52.031
she's not my girlfriend,
but that's my rebound pussy,

00:08:52.031 --> 00:08:54.867
and everyone at the bar
is now hitting on her

00:08:54.867 --> 00:08:56.601
now that she's a regular,

00:08:56.601 --> 00:08:59.639
and even if I did
have claim to her,

00:08:59.639 --> 00:09:01.307
no one would have--
she could be

00:09:01.307 --> 00:09:05.143
actively sucking my dick
at the bar

00:09:05.143 --> 00:09:09.147
while we're getting married
at the same time,

00:09:09.147 --> 00:09:11.116
and dudes would still be going,

00:09:11.116 --> 00:09:13.719
"What are you doing later?"

00:09:13.719 --> 00:09:14.887
I got--

00:09:14.887 --> 00:09:19.057
And there was one night
where I--

00:09:19.057 --> 00:09:20.959
I didn't want to be aggressive
with her.

00:09:20.959 --> 00:09:24.730
Like, I'm hands-off,
but there was one night--

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:27.299
There was a group of regulars
back then

00:09:27.299 --> 00:09:28.934
at the bar that I knew.

00:09:28.934 --> 00:09:31.136
There's three levels
of regulars.

00:09:31.136 --> 00:09:34.106
There's the guy that you hug
when you come in,

00:09:34.106 --> 00:09:36.141
there's the one
that you high-five,

00:09:36.141 --> 00:09:39.412
and then there's
the one you nod at.

00:09:41.647 --> 00:09:45.250
This one guy,
Lorca was his name.

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:47.452
Lorca, he was a nodder.

00:09:47.452 --> 00:09:50.990
He was a third level regular.

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:54.826
And he was this brooding,
dour drunk.

00:09:54.826 --> 00:09:56.862
He was a runty little fuck,

00:09:56.862 --> 00:09:59.598
and--and when he'd get drunk,
he'd just--

00:09:59.598 --> 00:10:01.766
he was always--
he looked like he was always

00:10:01.766 --> 00:10:05.337
at the edge of a fistfight,
and he just...

00:10:05.337 --> 00:10:07.506
But he was always sitting with--

00:10:07.506 --> 00:10:09.308
Renee was the girl,
the beautiful girl,

00:10:09.308 --> 00:10:12.011
and he--I--I noticed
he's sitting with her a lot,

00:10:12.011 --> 00:10:13.779
and I thought--is--

00:10:13.779 --> 00:10:14.981
is she fucking him?

00:10:14.981 --> 00:10:16.348
But I can't ask.

00:10:16.348 --> 00:10:17.783
She's just a girl I fucked,

00:10:17.783 --> 00:10:20.886
but she's everything I need.

00:10:20.886 --> 00:10:22.321
I need you now.

00:10:22.321 --> 00:10:23.955
I can't be alone
with the fucking

00:10:23.955 --> 00:10:28.060
carnival in my head
in my bed.

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:29.395
There was a night where

00:10:29.395 --> 00:10:32.130
we ended up playing
cat and mouse,

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:34.199
where...

00:10:34.199 --> 00:10:35.634
they were sitting together,

00:10:35.634 --> 00:10:37.870
and he'd get up
to get a drink,

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:41.039
and I'd sneak in, and try
to get her over to my table,

00:10:41.039 --> 00:10:43.208
or she'd get up to take a piss

00:10:43.208 --> 00:10:47.546
and I'd strategically locate
myself by that end of the bar

00:10:47.546 --> 00:10:49.048
so when she came out
of the bathroom,

00:10:49.048 --> 00:10:51.250
"Hey, I bought you a drink.
Come over this way.

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:53.485
Fuck that guy.
Come this way."

00:10:53.485 --> 00:10:56.354
And it was a--
it was a long night

00:10:56.354 --> 00:10:59.424
of drinking,
where I noticed

00:10:59.424 --> 00:11:02.394
Lorca was leering at me.

00:11:02.394 --> 00:11:04.830
And I've--I've seen him do this

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:07.233
every night
that I sit at this bar,

00:11:07.233 --> 00:11:09.434
but tonight I think, is--

00:11:09.434 --> 00:11:13.439
is he trying to mad dog me?

00:11:13.439 --> 00:11:17.743
I-is he--
or is he just fucked up?

00:11:17.743 --> 00:11:20.545
But he's just staring at me.

00:11:20.545 --> 00:11:23.215
He'd come up to my table
and lean on it.

00:11:23.215 --> 00:11:26.118
I was like, maybe
he's just fucked up.

00:11:26.118 --> 00:11:28.087
And at that point, uh,

00:11:28.087 --> 00:11:31.590
my, uh, friends Matt Becker
and big fat Ralphie May,

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:34.259
if you know big fat Ralphie May,
they show up,

00:11:34.259 --> 00:11:36.362
and I go, I don't know
if I'm being paranoid,

00:11:36.362 --> 00:11:38.964
but is this guy trying
to start shit with me?

00:11:38.964 --> 00:11:41.233
Like, look at how
he's looking at me.

00:11:41.233 --> 00:11:44.103
And they're both
more paranoid that me.

00:11:44.103 --> 00:11:47.206
And big fat Ralphie May,
"Yeah, Dougie Stanhope.

00:11:47.206 --> 00:11:50.209
"Yeah. Yeah, that guy's trying
to start some shit.

00:11:50.209 --> 00:11:52.577
Fuck that dude, man."

00:11:52.577 --> 00:11:53.612
And I--

00:11:53.612 --> 00:11:54.713
I--I--

00:11:54.713 --> 00:11:58.717
But he has done nothing overtly

00:11:58.717 --> 00:12:01.620
for me to, like, step up to him
and go like,

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:03.789
"Hey, you know, that--
the weird look

00:12:03.789 --> 00:12:05.824
"on your countenance
is disconcerting.

00:12:05.824 --> 00:12:07.225
Can you stop that, sir?"

00:12:07.225 --> 00:12:09.829
Like, I--
I have nothing to say, but I--

00:12:09.829 --> 00:12:13.065
I-I'm sad that
I'm such a coward.

00:12:13.065 --> 00:12:14.132
Like, I--

00:12:14.132 --> 00:12:17.435
Do I have to man-up
to this dude?

00:12:17.435 --> 00:12:19.805
Like, the--he's done nothing.

00:12:19.805 --> 00:12:21.273
I'm s--I'm--I'm sad

00:12:21.273 --> 00:12:24.109
that I'm so deluded
by this girl

00:12:24.109 --> 00:12:28.580
that I don't even know if I have
to be brave in the first place.

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:31.649
I just--I just want the girl.

00:12:31.649 --> 00:12:34.019
So I just let it ruin my night

00:12:34.019 --> 00:12:36.455
while he's staring at me
and I'm staring at him

00:12:36.455 --> 00:12:37.956
and I'm staring at her

00:12:37.956 --> 00:12:40.826
and I don't know how to fuckin'
close the deal.

00:12:43.696 --> 00:12:45.831
So at one point,

00:12:45.831 --> 00:12:48.334
they call, "Last call.

00:12:48.334 --> 00:12:53.338
You're welcome to be invited to
get the fuck out of our bar."

00:12:53.338 --> 00:12:57.843
We all funnel out and I'm still
trying to figure out

00:12:57.843 --> 00:13:01.313
how I can close the deal.

00:13:01.313 --> 00:13:04.016
Or if I'm gonna have to fucking
fight a dude?

00:13:04.016 --> 00:13:07.353
I don't--I don't...

00:13:07.353 --> 00:13:09.655
So we walk out of the bar.

00:13:09.655 --> 00:13:12.023
Ralphie May,
Matt Becker, and I,

00:13:12.023 --> 00:13:14.660
we take a left to go to the car,

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:18.897
and this dude Lorca
runs out behind us

00:13:18.897 --> 00:13:22.834
to try to cross Sunset Boulevard
in a hurry,

00:13:22.834 --> 00:13:24.836
and he gets killed

00:13:24.836 --> 00:13:27.205
by a speeding car.

00:13:27.205 --> 00:13:30.876
[shocked laughter]

00:13:30.876 --> 00:13:34.680
Literally knocked him
out of his shoes.

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:37.817
[laughter]

00:13:41.854 --> 00:13:45.825
I didn't expect the story
to end like that either.

00:13:47.559 --> 00:13:48.694
Thanks.

00:13:48.694 --> 00:13:50.562
[cheers and applause]
