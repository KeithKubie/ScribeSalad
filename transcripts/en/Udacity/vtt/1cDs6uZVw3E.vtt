00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.360
So why is configuration hard to get

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.810
right? First, it's difficult to define what we

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:07.540
mean by correct behaviour in the first

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.080
place. Second, the interactions between multiple routing protocols

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.590
can lead to unpredictability. Furthermore, each autonomous

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.930
system on the internet is independently configured. And

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.740
the interaction between the policies of these autonomous

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.770
systems can lead to unintended, or unwanted behaviour.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.410
The third reason that configuration is

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.890
hard, is that operators simply make mistakes.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.180
Configuration is difficult, and network policies

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.600
are very complex. Furthermore, Network configuration has

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.170
historically been distributed across hundreds, or

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.820
more, network devices. Across the network where

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.646
each device is configured with vendor-specific

00:00:48.646 --> 00:00:52.050
low-level configuration. We'll see in the first

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.690
part of this course how Software Defined Networking or SDN changes this,

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.370
by centralizing the network's configuration in

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.640
a logically centralized controller. At a

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.160
very high level, Software Defined Networking

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.860
provides exactly the primitives that operators

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.960
need to run the network better.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.380
In particular, SDN provides operators three things.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:24.990
The first, is network-wide views of both topology and traffic. The second,

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.170
is the ability to satisfy network level objectives such as those that we talked

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.900
about before including load balance, security,

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.320
and other high level goals. The third

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.720
thing, that software defined networking provides

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.760
that network operators need, is direct control.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.450
In particular, rather than requiring network operators to configure each

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.750
device individually with indirect configuration, SDN

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.950
allows an operator to write a control program that directly

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.050
affects the data plane. So rather than having to

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.880
configure each device individually and guess or infer what might

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.350
happen, software-defined networking allows a network operator to express network

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:23.270
level objectives and direct control from A logically centralized controller. So

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:29.000
to make network operations easier, routers should forward packets

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.500
since router hardware is specialized to forward traffic at very high rates.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.330
They should collect measurements such as traffic

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.280
statistics and topology information. But on the

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.220
other hand, there's no reason that a

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.480
router should have to compute routes. Although,

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.600
conventionally, routing has operated as a distributed

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.160
computation of forwarding tables, the computation doesn't

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.400
inherently need to run on the routers.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.480
Rather, the computation could be logically centralized,

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.790
and controlled, from a centralized control program.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.180
This logical centralization is the fundamental tenant

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.740
of SDN. So a simple way of summing up Software Defined Networking is simply

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.880
to remove routing from the routers, and

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.340
perform that routing computation at a logically

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.590
centralized controller. Now of course, SDN has

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.530
evolved to incorporate, a much broader range

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.050
of controls than simply routing decisions, and we'll talk about the range

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.130
of control that SDN controllers enable

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.520
in today's networks, throughout this lesson.
