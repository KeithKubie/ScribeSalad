Okay, Ginny is heterozygous we would expect there to be

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.520
a 50% chance that she would pass on the dominant allele

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.109
to one of her children. Now there are reasons for

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.510
this that were going to explore throughout the rest of the lesson.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.500
You can just consider that Ginny has 2 alleles and

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.470
there's roughly a fifty fifty chance that she's going to Pass either

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.945
allele onto her offspring. So, there would be about a

00:00:21.945 --> 00:00:25.470
50% chance she would pass on the dominant allele or 50%

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.710
chance she would pass on the recessive allele.
