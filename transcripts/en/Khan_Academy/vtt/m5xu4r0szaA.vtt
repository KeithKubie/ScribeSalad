00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.200
Where we left off in the last
series of videos, we had the

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:13.500
Chinese Central Bank that was
trying to make sure that the

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.800
yuan does not appreciate
too much.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.620
So the way they did that is that
they bought up all of the

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.730
excess dollars using yuan
that they printed.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:30.150
So what they do is, they print
yuan-- I'll do the yuan in

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:40.360
this blue color-- so they print
yuan, and then they use

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.330
that printed yuan to buy dollars
in the open market.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.360
And what that does is it props
up the demand for dollars and

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.370
keeps the price of yuan down,
so then they get dollars.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.820
So they print yuan and
they buy dollars.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.090
And as we saw, they have to keep
doing this in order to

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.780
keep the yuan deflated,
or in order to

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.860
keep the dollar inflated.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.100
And this is so that they
can maintain a

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.840
favorable balance of trade.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.680
But as they do this, they're
just building the stockpile of

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:18.930
dollar reserves.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.620
And as we mentioned in the last
video, they're not just

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.510
keeping a big vault of
dollar bills there.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.760
They're going to use it to buy
assets, and they're going to

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.730
buy liquid and safe assets.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.030
And the main asset they're
going to buy is

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.890
U.S. Treasury bills.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.600
So then they take these dollars
and they buy U.S.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.160
Treasury bills.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.940
And let me draw some of the
other actors here, because

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.160
they can buy it from two
separate people.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.870
There is the United
States government.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.586
So there is the U.S. Treasury.

00:01:53.586 --> 00:01:56.620
They are going to issue Treasury
bills, when they

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.500
essentially just need
to borrow money.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.560
And then there's other people
that have already bought

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.650
Treasury bills.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.300
So let me draw them over here.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.930
So then there are other people
who own Treasury bills.

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.770
So this is someone who owns a
Treasury bill right over here,

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.820
wearing a hat, maybe
with a little bit

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.230
of hair and a moustache.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.780
So this is someone who
owns a Treasury bill.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.680
So just to give a review, when
the U.S. government wants to

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:27.360
borrow money, people hand the
U.S. government money-- I'll

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.890
draw it as a dollar bill, right
over there-- they hand

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.460
the U.S. Treasury money, and
then the U.S. Treasury gives

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:35.710
them an IOU.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:45.690
This IOU is what a Treasury bill
is, and what it entitles

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.240
the holder of this piece of
paper to, it allows them to

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.070
get interest from the Treasury,
depending on what

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.240
type of Treasury bill
or bond it will be.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.610
It'll be over a certain
period of time.

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.880
I have a whole video on this,
especially the ones where I

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.240
talk about the yield curve.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.910
And then at some future date,
the U.S. Treasury is going to

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.200
pay them a larger amount of
money than they put back in.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:13.030
So this right here is a
Treasury bond or bill.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.630
T-bill if it's a shorter
duration, Treasury bond if

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.320
it's a longer duration.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.630
This is a Treasury bond.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.220
It is a loan to the
U.S. Treasury.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.450
Now, the Chinese Central
Bank, they have all

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.750
these excess dollars.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.180
They can buy treasuries from
either two sources.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.210
When the U.S. Treasury itself
needs to raise funds, it will

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.860
essentially put these
IOUs for auction.

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.740
It will sell them to whoever
is willing to take them for

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.600
the least interest. So let me
put it this way, so what they

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.440
can do is they can give the
money directly to the U.S.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.240
Treasury, when the U.S. Treasury
puts Treasury bills

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.540
or Treasury bonds
up for auction.

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.670
So it can give the money
directly to the U.S. Treasury,

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.470
and then the U.S. Treasury will
give them one of these

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:06.450
IOUs, or it could buy it from
someone already has it out in

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:07.700
the open market.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.100
This is a very deep, very,
very liquid open market.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.430
Or they can give these people
right over here money, and

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.089
then they would transfer the IOU
over to this Central Bank.

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:24.670
So what is happening at
the Central Bank?

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:27.160
What is essentially
happening here?

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.420
What's essentially happening
is the Chinese Central Bank

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.300
printing money to buy dollars
that it will then essentially

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.800
lend to the U.S. Treasury.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.110
So it looks kind of convoluted,
but the essence of

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.720
what is happening here is that
the Chinese government, you

00:04:44.720 --> 00:05:01.240
have the Chinese Central Bank
lending to the U.S.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.700
government.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.380
And it might be buying other
assets, but the Treasury bonds

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.140
and bills are really the main
form of liquid asset they

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.460
might be buying.

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.230
So how does this affect the
United States, other than the

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:15.876
fact that instead of owing other
investors these IOUs, it

00:05:15.876 --> 00:05:16.500
now owes it to the Chinese?

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.760
But what is the net effect of
having this player out here,

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.880
having this very significant
player out there, that is

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:28.620
fairly aggressively willing to
pay for U.S. government IOUs,

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:29.850
U.S. treasuries?

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.090
What is the effect of that?

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.700
Well, we saw in the yield curve
video that the more

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.900
people willing to give you a
loan, the lower the interest

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:37.540
rates are going to be.

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.580
And I can show you a very
simple example of that.

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:44.100
If I'm looking to borrow-- and
I'm no longer talking about

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.410
nations, I'm just talking about
Sal now-- let's say that

00:05:47.410 --> 00:06:01.510
I'm over here, and I'm looking
to borrow $10.

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:04.510
And I say, hey, who's willing
to give me the best deal on

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.960
$10, and I'm going to pay
you back next week.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:14.490
So you might come along and say,
I'll lend it to you for

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.120
10% interest over a week.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:25.900
So you can pay me
$11 next week.

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.610
So this would essentially be
10% interest over the week.

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.920
You give me $10 now, and if I
agree to you, then I'll give

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.560
you $11 in a week.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.900
That would be 10% interest.

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.890
But then let's say
Mary comes along.

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:40.950
And she says, oh, I can do
better than Mr. Orange Guy

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:41.430
over there.

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:42.680
This is Mary.

00:06:48.820 --> 00:07:00.310
I'll lend you $10, and you can
pay me $10.50 next week.

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:01.380
So notice what happened.

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:03.780
Both of these people
have $10 to lend.

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:06.540
They're looking to get some
return on their $10.

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:09.310
If he was the only player here,
I'd have to go to him

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:11.460
and say, OK I'm going to pay
you 10% interest. Then she

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.560
says, no, no, no, I also have
$10 and, gee, I'd be happy

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.390
with just a 5% return.

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:19.450
$0.50 off of my $10 in one week,
that's a good return.

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:20.880
So right now, look
at this person.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:25.160
But the more money that's
available to borrow, the more

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.740
competitive this side of the
equation is going to be, and

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.940
the lower the interest
rate I can get.

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:33.440
You can imagine even a third
person says, no, no, no, wait!

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.770
I've got $10.

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:40.710
Let me draw this third person,
who says, I have $10,

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:41.570
and you know what?

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:43.590
It's going to just be sitting
in my bank account doing

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:45.400
nothing unless I
lend it to you.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:52.870
You can pay me, I don't know,
$10.25 next week.

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:53.960
And then I'm going to
go to this person.

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:56.810
So the larger than the number
of people willing to lend to

00:07:56.810 --> 00:08:00.190
me, the lower my interest
rate will be.

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:03.310
Or another way you could think
of it, the larger the supply

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:18.210
of money to be lent, that leads
to lower-- you can view

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:18.930
it different ways.

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:26.280
You could view it as lower
borrowing costs, which is

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:31.280
another way of just saying lower
interest. Or you can

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.840
even view it as cheaper money.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.090
It costs less to borrow
the money.

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:40.360
The cost of borrowing money
is the interest.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:41.580
Now, what does that do?

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:42.890
What does having
lower interest?

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:45.950
So this is just a small example
with me trying to

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:47.220
borrow $10.

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:49.490
The more people there are, the
more competitive that is, the

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:51.960
better interest rate I'll have.
So you just take that

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.590
same notion to kind
of a macro level.

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:57.570
The U.S. government is
constantly borrowing money.

00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:00.110
The more people out there
willing to give it money,

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:03.220
willing to buy the U.S.
government's IOUs, the lower

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:04.760
the interest rate will be.

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:10.540
So the net effect of having
this major buyer of U.S.

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:14.180
Treasuries is that having them
out there accumulating all of

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:16.790
these dollars, taking them all
out of the foreign exchange

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:20.710
markets and then using them to
buy treasuries, it lowers the

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:24.190
interest rate for treasuries.

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:29.070
So the net effect is the
U.S. Treasury has

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:32.650
lower borrowing costs.

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:36.670
So what does that mean?

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:38.740
So let's make it very clear.

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:49.730
So the Chinese buy treasuries,
which are essentially loans to

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:52.170
the U.S. government,
then the U.S. has

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:53.595
lower borrowing costs.

00:09:53.595 --> 00:10:00.690
The U.S. has lower interest
or borrowing cost. And I'm

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:04.090
talking about the government
right now.

00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:07.300
And this has several interesting
side effects.

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:12.250
This means that it's
easier for the

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:16.560
government to finance deficits.

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:22.730
They don't have to
pay as much in

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:25.380
interest to finance deficits.

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:27.220
So that means that they
can spend more.

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:31.490
They can give out more payments
to U.S. citizens, or

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:33.500
they could lower taxes,
either one.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.040
Both of those would
lead to deficits.

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:41.210
So it's easier so that the
government can either spend

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:45.890
more or they don't have
to raise taxes.

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:49.670
Or they could they could lower
taxes, because they don't have

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:51.840
to spend as much in interest.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:54.600
Now, the other interesting thing
that the U.S. Treasury

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:57.350
borrowing costs go down, that
means that the interest rate

00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:00.240
on everything goes down.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.770
This is one of the benchmark
interest rates.

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:05.080
And you should watch the video
on the yield curve if you want

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.130
to understand more about it.

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:07.480
And I know some of you are
saying, wait, doesn't the

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:09.820
Federal Reserve set
interest rates?

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:13.710
The Federal Reserve only sets
overnight, very short-term.

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:16.150
If you're going to borrow money
overnight in your bank,

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:18.390
that's what the Federal
Reserve sets.

00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:21.470
If the U.S. government is
borrowing money over 5 or 10

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:25.100
years or 20 years, that
is that by the market.

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:28.350
That is set by a market
mechanism very similar to what

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:29.720
I showed just over here.

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.580
So this is dependant
on more capital

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:32.860
being there to be borrowed.

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:36.920
So this is 10-year, and 15-year,
and 20-year debt for

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.900
the U.S. becomes cheaper.

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:40.920
But this makes all debt
in the U.S. cheaper.

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:53.300
And there's two ways
you can think about

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:55.340
why this piece happens.

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:58.170
One is, just on a very
superficial level, people say,

00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:02.110
hey, you know, someone like
General Electric is only a

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:04.610
little bit more risky than
the U.S. government.

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:08.810
If the U.S. government only has
to pay 3% on its on debt

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:10.970
that it has to pay back in 10
years, maybe General Electric

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:16.010
should only have to pay
0.3% more than that.

00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:18.950
So you use the U.S. government
as a baseline, and then

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:20.420
depending on people's
risk, they pay a

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:21.950
little higher spread.

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:26.590
Another way to think about
it is up here.

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:28.830
The Chinese government is just
pouring dollars either

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:35.040
directly into the U.S.
government, or into the actual

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.220
U.S. Treasury market.

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:38.540
So this guy right now,
he has more dollars.

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:40.540
He's not going to use the
Treasury, because he thinks

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:42.850
treasuries are too expensive,
which means that their

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:44.240
interest is too low.

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:46.100
So he's going to take these
dollars he got from the

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:48.620
Chinese, and he's going to
lend it to someone else.

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:49.910
That dollar is still there.

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:52.510
He'll lend it to General
Electric, or maybe he's a

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:55.650
credit card company and he'll
lend it to the consumer.

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:59.500
So in general, all debt in
the U.S. gets cheaper.

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:02.740
Now, what's the net effect
of all of these points?

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:05.870
What's the net effect of
this, all debt in the

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:06.630
U.S. Becomes cheaper?

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:10.630
There's just more dollars for
loan in the U.S., more dollars

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:12.340
than people can borrow.

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:15.220
The government is spending more,
or the government will

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:16.000
lower taxes.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.020
What is the net effect
of all of this?

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:21.760
Well, people will either have
more money in their pockets,

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.910
because they've gotten a
government job or they've

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:26.090
maybe gotten some type of
entitlement payment.

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:28.010
Or, they're going to have more
money in their pockets,

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:29.620
because they're paying
lower taxes.

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:31.790
Or they're going to have more
money in their pockets,

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:34.410
because it's easier for them
to put more debt on their

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:37.380
credit card, or to refinance
their mortgage.

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:47.800
So all of these lead to more
cash in American pockets.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:51.040
Now, that's obviously not an
unambiguously good thing,

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:53.580
because this is all financed
with debt.

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:55.870
It's not just solid
debt-free cash.

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:59.990
So more cash in American
pockets essentially

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:01.240
financed with debt.

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:10.550
And this debt, as you can see,
it's either occurring at the

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:13.220
credit card level, it could
be occurring even at the

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:16.610
corporate debt level, or it's
occurring indirectly at the

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:17.420
government level.

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:20.880
But all of this is being enabled
by the fact that China

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:23.570
is willing to buy treasuries,
which means that China is

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:26.240
really just willing to
lend to the U.S.

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.450
So what's happening?

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:32.100
China is artificially keeping
its currency low, and it's

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:36.080
doing that by buying dollars,
taking those dollars and

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:39.280
essentially lending them
to the United States.

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:42.570
And that eventually ends up in
the hands of American people

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:44.660
and companies, and even
the government.

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:46.150
And what are they going to do?

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:49.390
Well, they're going to buy cheap
Chinese products that

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:52.465
are artificially cheap because
the currency is lower.

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:03.130
And obviously, you know, they do
have lower labor costs and

00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:05.960
all of that, but it's even lower
to the American than it

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:08.490
would be if the currency were
allowed to freely float.

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:15.400
So the net effect of this entire
scenario that I've been

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:18.820
describing over the last few
videos, is that the Chinese

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:22.310
are essentially lending money
to the Americans to then go

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:26.160
ahead and buy more
Chinese products.
