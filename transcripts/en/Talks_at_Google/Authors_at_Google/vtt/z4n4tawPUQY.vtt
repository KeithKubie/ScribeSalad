00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.220
FEMALE SPEAKER: So I'm
really excited to introduce

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:11.690
Joanne Chang.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.670
She is the co-owner and pastry
chef at Flour Bakery + Cafe,

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.130
with four locations in
Boston and Cambridge,

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.810
as well as the co-owner
of Myers + Chang.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.140
This is her third
visit our office,

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.190
and she has three cookbooks now.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:31.840
So I'm looking forward to her
fourth visit to us maybe soon.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.180
Please join me in welcoming
Joanne Chang up here

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.727
to the stage.

00:00:35.727 --> 00:00:37.675
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:37.675 --> 00:00:39.136
JOANNE CHANG: Thank you.

00:00:39.136 --> 00:00:42.070
FEMALE SPEAKER: Have a seat.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.620
So I am really
excited that I get

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.530
to talk to you about this,
because I love to bake,

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.350
and it's something that I've
got to do since I was really,

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.540
I think, like eight years old.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.170
And my parents never
really baked much,

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.640
so I started making cookies
and cakes and anything.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.440
The low sugar thing
is interesting,

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.800
and it's been something
that I think a lot of people

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.230
are interested in
learning more about.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.790
What made you start to decide
to do a cookbook about that?

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.540
JOANNE CHANG: It
certainly wasn't anything

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.210
that I had planned all along.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.320
The first baking
book, "Flour," I'd

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.850
always wanted to
write a baking book.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.597
The second book,
"Flour, Too," was

00:01:24.597 --> 00:01:26.430
kind of a natural
offshoot of the first one,

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.060
because there are
a lot of people

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.400
who like to eat savory things.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.720
And at the bakery, we do a
lot of sandwiches and soups

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:32.320
and salads.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.690
And so after the
first book came out,

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.540
a lot of people, a
lot of our customers,

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.209
said, what happened to all of
the savory part of your menu?

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:42.500
So that led to the second book.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.660
So this third book, "Baking with
Less Sugar," was not in my plan

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.770
until I started to think, OK,
next book, what should I do?

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.320
I really enjoy writing books,
and honestly, the next book

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.940
was supposed to be the
Myers + Chang book.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:58.750
FEMALE SPEAKER: That'll
be your fourth visit.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.130
JOANNE CHANG: That is going
to be the fourth visit,

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.129
and we did just sign a
deal for the fourth book.

00:02:02.129 --> 00:02:04.150
So that one will be forthcoming.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.498
But what happened
was I was starting

00:02:06.498 --> 00:02:08.539
to write the proposal for
the Myers + Chang book,

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.420
and like two or three
things happened all at once.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.990
One, at home, for
myself and my husband--

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.940
I eat sugar all day long.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.980
That's part of my job,
to go to all the bakeries

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.560
and taste the
things that we make.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.550
And fortunate for me, I don't
have a problem with sugar.

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.250
I've been eating it my
whole life, and I love it.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.050
My husband loves
sugar, but he is

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.890
somebody who definitely goes
through sugar highs and sugar

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:35.920
lows.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.770
I used to bring stuff home from
the bakery, and after eating it

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.190
he would just crash.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.690
And I started to try
to figure out ways

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.870
that I could bring
stuff home or make stuff

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.570
at home that he could enjoy
and not feel deprived,

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.060
but that wouldn't cause him
to do this up and down thing.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.450
So I was just starting to
experiment at home, just for me

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:57.000
personally.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.639
At about the same time,
my publisher, Chronicle,

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:02.680
called me and said, OK,
we're interested in doing

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.500
a third book with you.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.040
And I was like, great.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.700
Myers + Chang?

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.842
And they said, no, we actually
think that a low sugar

00:03:07.842 --> 00:03:09.300
book would be
something that people

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.870
would be really interested in.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.520
I thought, OK, I'm
doing this at home.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.850
This could be a thing.

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.020
I wasn't positive.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.620
And then literally probably
about a week later,

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.800
"Oprah Magazine"
emailed and said,

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.280
we want you to write an
article about five desserts

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.070
with no sugar.

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.750
Can you do it?

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.740
And I just thought, this
is just meant to be.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:27.340
It's a sign.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.990
I don't know.

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.810
So I did these five
desserts for the magazine,

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.861
and I sent them to
Chronicle Books and I said,

00:03:33.861 --> 00:03:34.610
what do you think?

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.193
And they said, this
is your next book.

00:03:36.193 --> 00:03:40.550
So I spent about a
year testing recipes.

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.230
And this was really
challenging for me,

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.970
because the first two
books are all recipes that

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:45.750
currently exist.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.916
They're things that we serve
every day at the bakery

00:03:47.916 --> 00:03:50.900
that I have recipes for that
we make in huge batch sizes.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.330
So with the first
and second book,

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.310
I just had to reduce
the batch size.

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.000
But for this third
book, I had to make up

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.330
recipes for pretty much
every single recipe,

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:00.800
to start from scratch.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.341
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Yeah, that was really

00:04:02.341 --> 00:04:04.320
interesting to read
in your introduction

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.106
and throughout the book-- how
you were able to test recipes,

00:04:08.106 --> 00:04:09.730
and the ones that
you thought might not

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.630
work, like the monkey bread
recipe that you said actually

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:13.260
did work.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.010
And I haven't had a
chance to make it yet,

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.200
but it really good.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.480
I'm actually curious if
there were any recipes

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.530
that you thought would work
or that you tried really

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.500
hard to make work that you just
couldn't get with low sugar.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.130
JOANNE CHANG: Yeah, there's one
recipe that's still in my head,

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.130
because I still want to
try to figure it out.

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.759
So there's lemon pudding cake.

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:36.300
Have you ever had
lemon pudding cake?

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.170
It's a really easy cake batter.

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:42.480
you make this cake batter, you
put it in a pan, you bake it,

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.200
and naturally, the cake
part floats to the top,

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.560
and then at the bottom
is a layer pudding.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.110
It's a really simple,
wonderful desert.

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.420
And I thought, I
would love to do

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.560
a low-sugar, no-sugar
version, but with maple syrup.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.320
And I thought, maybe I could
make a maple pudding cake.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.920
And I imagined this top
layer of cake floating

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.010
to the top that was
kind of like a pancake,

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.550
and then maybe like a creamy,
maple-y sauce at the bottom.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.570
Doesn't that sound good?

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:12.010
I had the vision of what it was
going to taste like in my head.

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:15.094
I must have made maple
pudding cake like every week

00:05:15.094 --> 00:05:16.260
probably for the whole year.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.759
I feel like it was about the
whole year of writing the book,

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:20.610
and it just kept
being that recipe

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.190
that I was like, I'm going
to try it again next week.

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:23.410
I'm going to try
it again next week.

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:24.200
I never got it.

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.280
I think what happens is
you have to do something

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.630
with the eggs that involves
sugar that doesn't work

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.980
with maple in order to get
the pudding to the sink

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.280
and the cake to rise.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.870
FEMALE SPEAKER: That brings me
to an interesting question too,

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.660
is the science behind sugar.

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.980
And there were other
things like meringues

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.700
that you said you knew
you couldn't really

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:47.570
even bother doing.

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:51.470
Could you tell us a little
bit about what low-sugar means

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:57.230
in this cookbook, and maybe also
a little bit about the science

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:01.670
behind sugar and how it helps
make certain things work

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:03.252
the way they do in baking?

00:06:03.252 --> 00:06:05.460
JOANNE CHANG: So I thought
that the biggest challenge

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.780
in writing this book was
going to be figuring out

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:11.850
how to replicate the sweetness
in desserts, because you're

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:13.810
eliminating sugar.

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:15.810
Because that's what we
think of as sugar, right?

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:16.480
It's sweet.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.890
So if you have something
that has less sugar,

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:19.056
it's going to be less sweet.

00:06:19.056 --> 00:06:22.020
So how do I trick the palate
into thinking that it still

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:23.150
tastes sweet?

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.820
But that ended up being the
easiest part of the book,

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.310
in part because we
are very adaptable.

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:31.780
And it works with salt,
and it works with sugar.

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:35.720
If you go without salt or
if you go without sugar,

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.630
I don't know the exact time
it takes, but after a while

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:42.160
your palate just starts to
naturally prefer the less

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.190
salt or the less sugar.

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:44.610
And it's the same with
more salt and more sugar.

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:47.240
The more you eat of sugar
and the more you eat of salt,

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.900
the more your palate
adjusts to that,

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.720
and then you want things that
are more sugary or more salty.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.790
So that part was easy
in that once I started

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:59.250
testing these recipes
with less sugar, for me,

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:01.520
I recognized that things
that were less sweet

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.430
tasted just as
good, if not better.

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:05.970
But the challenging part
was the chemistry of sugar,

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:10.670
because sugar does so many
other things than just sweeten.

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:12.890
The main-- well, there's
a bunch of main things,

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:15.310
but one of the big
things that sugar does

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.020
is it's hygroscopic,
which means that it

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.989
attracts moisture in the air.

00:07:20.989 --> 00:07:22.030
And so it attracts water.

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:24.890
And so in any baked good
that has sugar in it,

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:27.940
it sits there on the counter,
and as it's sitting there

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:31.190
it's attracting water
molecules from the air

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:32.620
and bringing it to itself.

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:34.526
And that's what makes
the pastry stay moist

00:07:34.526 --> 00:07:35.400
for a couple of days.

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.220
So you can make a
cake today and still

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:38.640
serve it tomorrow
or the next day,

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.924
and it'll still
be great if it has

00:07:40.924 --> 00:07:42.090
the regular amount of sugar.

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:44.820
As you start to
reduce sugar, it'll

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:46.970
taste great when it's
fresh out of the oven.

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:50.170
And then maybe by tonight
or maybe by tomorrow

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:53.300
it's dry, because it doesn't
have the sugars to draw

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.350
in all the moisture.

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:58.530
Another thing that sugar
does is that it caramelizes

00:07:58.530 --> 00:07:59.730
is when it's in the oven.

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:02.230
And so when you're making
something like a cookie,

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:05.880
the sugar combines with all
of the other ingredients

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.230
in the batter, and then
it hits that oven heat

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:09.706
and then it starts
to caramelize.

00:08:09.706 --> 00:08:11.080
And that's what
allows the cookie

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:13.040
to be kind of crunchy
on the outside

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.050
and then maybe a little
soft on the inside.

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:17.460
So it's really challenging
to get texture right

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:19.750
when you don't have sugar,
or if you have less sugar.

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:22.172
I think that was a
really big challenge.

00:08:22.172 --> 00:08:23.630
Another thing that
sugar does which

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:26.430
is kind of in line
with the caramelization

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:29.250
is that it adds
color to baked goods.

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:34.270
And so any picture-- if you
imagine a beautiful vanilla

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:37.750
cake, you just see
like golden brown.

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:40.059
Every recipe says,
bake till golden brown.

00:08:40.059 --> 00:08:41.940
But you can't bake
things till golden brown

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:45.060
if there's no sugar, because
it'll never get that way.

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:46.920
And that was, for
me, something that

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:49.840
took me awhile to recognize.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.650
I was making the carrot
cake, which is actually

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:55.040
the cover photo in the book.

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.470
And the carrot cake doesn't
have any sugar in it,

00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:58.570
but it has apple juice.

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:00.700
It has reduced apple juice.

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:03.505
And I kept making this batter
and testing it and tasting it

00:09:03.505 --> 00:09:05.130
and saying, OK, it
tastes sweet enough,

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:06.171
putting it into the oven.

00:09:06.171 --> 00:09:08.050
And then I do everything by eye.

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:11.894
I don't do it by time,
because ovens are different,

00:09:11.894 --> 00:09:13.310
and everything's
always different.

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:17.030
So at this point, I just look
at things and I touch them.

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:18.780
And the first couple
rounds of this cake,

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:21.540
I would keep it in there
until it got brown,

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:23.810
which it turns out
was pretty much burnt,

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:25.990
because it doesn't
brown without the sugar.

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:29.150
And so when you pull it out of
the oven, it looks really pale.

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:31.484
It looks the same color
as it did when it goes in.

00:09:31.484 --> 00:09:32.900
It's just a little
bit more solid.

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:35.000
So you have to get used
to that when you're not

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.510
baking with as much sugar.

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:38.260
FEMALE SPEAKER: I
really liked the way you

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.190
have the chapters organized.

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:42.980
It starts with the
lower sugar recipes

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:46.865
and then goes into just
chocolate, honey, maple,

00:09:46.865 --> 00:09:47.930
and then fruit.

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:55.370
What was your reasoning behind
organizing it in that way?

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:58.270
JOANNE CHANG: Well, I wanted
to ease people into the idea.

00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:02.020
So the first chapter is
probably about 10 or 12 recipes

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:06.490
of things that we all
eat every day that have

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:08.060
less sugar-- so not no-sugar.

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:11.710
So the fudgy mascarpone
brownies that I made,

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:15.370
the banana bread,
yellow birthday cake,

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:18.860
coconut chiffon cake-- all of
those have white sugar in them,

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:22.090
but at least half
the amount or even

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:24.270
less than your standard recipe.

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:26.090
So I wanted to just
kind of introduce

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:28.480
the baker, or the
reader, to the idea

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.320
that you can reduce
sugar and still have

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.090
something that tastes great.

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:35.910
In fact, we have samples of
the oatmeal raisin walnut

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:38.510
cookie that is made with a
third of the amount of sugar

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:40.410
as the standard recipe.

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:43.690
So that was the first chapter.

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:49.010
And then, in terms of grouping
it according to flavors--

00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:51.172
you asked earlier why did
I want to write the book,

00:10:51.172 --> 00:10:52.630
and I give you a
couple of reasons.

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:55.360
Another reason is that sugar
itself doesn't actually

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:56.210
taste like anything.

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:57.450
It's just sweet.

00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:01.860
Whereas sweeteners like
maple and honey and fruit

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:05.000
actually have flavor, and they
add a whole other dimension

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.220
of flavor to whatever it
is that you're making.

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:09.450
And a big part of
writing this book

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:11.665
was recognizing that
if you don't use sugar

00:11:11.665 --> 00:11:13.430
as your sweetener
but instead turn

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:17.230
to a natural sweetener like a
honey or a maple or molasses,

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:20.640
you're adding that flavor
to your baked good, which

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.752
is in my world a
really great thing.

00:11:22.752 --> 00:11:24.210
You have something
that tastes good

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:25.560
and you add more flavor to it.

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:26.920
That's even better.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.650
So I wanted to group
it accordingly,

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:31.275
so that if you're somebody
who really likes honey

00:11:31.275 --> 00:11:33.320
and if you like that
flavor of honey,

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:34.940
here's a whole bunch
of recipes that

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:37.320
allow you to use that
rather than white sugar

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:38.825
in making your baked goods.

00:11:38.825 --> 00:11:39.700
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:42.040
And I told you I made the
lemon ricotta cupcakes, which

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:43.290
are just sweetened with honey.

00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:44.760
And it was great,
and you would never

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.135
have known that
the frosting even

00:11:46.135 --> 00:11:47.765
didn't have any sugar in it.

00:11:47.765 --> 00:11:49.490
It was great.

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:52.930
So I did notice that the only
cheesecake recipe in here

00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:55.417
is cheesecake maple bar,
something like that?

00:11:55.417 --> 00:11:56.500
JOANNE CHANG: The pumpkin?

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:57.220
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah, pumpkin.

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:58.440
That's what it was.

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.850
Was there any reason that
you didn't-- I happen to love

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:03.130
cheesecake, so first I'm
asking about cheesecake.

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:05.750
Was there any reason
you didn't do just

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:08.520
a regular, straight-up
cheesecake, or just as it

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:09.500
happened?

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:11.920
JOANNE CHANG: No, no reason.

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.760
I wanted to do
something with pumpkin,

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:19.060
and we've often talked
about introducing a pumpkin

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:21.690
cheesecake during the
Thanksgiving period

00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:22.310
at the bakery.

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:25.100
And so I was thinking that
we could do something.

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:27.810
I mean, pumpkin goes
well with maple,

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:32.300
but we already have in the
book a maple pumpkin pie.

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:36.130
So then I got really
interested and excited

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:38.260
about baking with dates.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.010
And so this recipe
has dates in the base,

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:43.150
and then the actual
cheesecake is

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:45.170
sweetened with reduced
apple juice, which

00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:49.450
is one of the go-to's
in the fruit chapter.

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:51.630
Again, you bring in
so many more flavors

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:54.930
when you are working with
fruits versus just with sugar.

00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:58.085
And I wanted to try out
mixing apple and pumpkin,

00:12:58.085 --> 00:12:59.779
and it all worked out great.

00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:01.070
FEMALE SPEAKER: That's awesome.

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:03.110
So again, we were
talking about this

00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:07.030
before-- I had thought about
going to culinary school

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:08.300
for pastry arts at one point.

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:10.420
Almost dropped out of
grad school to do it,

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:13.140
and decided instead
not to, in part

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:15.600
because I was worried
that if I did something

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.180
that I loved doing at
home and on my own time

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:20.100
all the time for work,
I wouldn't enjoy it

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:21.540
as much anymore.

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:24.240
So do you still like baking?

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:25.740
JOANNE CHANG: I
still love baking.

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:29.270
I don't make as much
as I used to, for sure.

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:33.820
The first six years of the
bakery, I was baking every day.

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:35.800
And then when we opened
the second location,

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:38.510
my role shifted so that I
was no longer in the kitchen

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:40.307
every single day.

00:13:40.307 --> 00:13:42.640
But I still in the kitchen
probably about half the time.

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:45.230
And then when we opened
Cambridge, the third location,

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:48.090
then it shifted entirely
out of the kitchen.

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:51.950
So I bake now when I'm
testing recipes for a book,

00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:55.544
and I'll bake at home just
for special occasions.

00:13:55.544 --> 00:13:56.960
It's still something
that I enjoy,

00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:00.510
but as somebody who
if you enjoy baking

00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:02.100
and you want to do
it professionally--

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:04.860
not that I think you guys are
looking for career changes,

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:08.660
but if you were-- it
is very, very different

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:09.660
to do it professionally.

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:10.230
It's a job.

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:11.790
It's still work.

00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:14.960
We get a lot of people, a lot of
career changers, who come to us

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:17.590
and say, I bake a lot at
home and I really love it,

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:20.640
and I want to come learn how
to make cookies at Flour.

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:24.030
And everybody loves it for
about two weeks, sometimes

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:26.490
three weeks, and then
the reality hits in.

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:28.380
It's like, every day
you're going to come in

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:31.200
and you're going to
crack 20 flats of eggs,

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:34.420
and then you're going to do
this, and nothing changes.

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:38.560
There's just a lot of detail
and work, and it's hard

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:39.420
and it's sweaty.

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:40.170
It's still work.

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:42.570
So when you're baking
at home, you obviously

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:44.221
have freedom to do
whatever you want.

00:14:44.221 --> 00:14:45.720
You get to eat it
whenever you want.

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:46.970
And if it doesn't
work out, no big deal.

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:48.190
You just make something else.

00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:49.773
Doesn't really work
like that at work.

00:14:49.773 --> 00:14:53.240
So I always try to make people
understand that it's still

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:55.040
really fun to bake at
work, but it's just

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:56.170
a different type of fun.

00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:57.530
FEMALE SPEAKER: Sure.

00:14:57.530 --> 00:15:00.790
So my last question before
we open it up to the audience

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:02.990
is we have backyard hens.

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:05.670
And so I often
have a refrigerator

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:08.500
full of two, three dozen eggs.

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:13.140
What's your favorite recipe
that uses a lot of eggs?

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:15.577
JOANNE CHANG: Let's see,
recipes that use a lot of eggs.

00:15:15.577 --> 00:15:17.410
FEMALE SPEAKER: Sweet
or savory, either way.

00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:20.630
JOANNE CHANG: Well,
it would be sweet.

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:23.030
The chiffon cake that's
in this book actually,

00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:26.310
or any angel food
cake or chiffon cake

00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:28.600
is great for using
a lot of eggs.

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.870
The angel food cake in the first
book, I think, uses 12 eggs,

00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:35.130
and I think this cake
might use 8 or 12 eggs.

00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:37.990
Any custard basically is going
to use a lot of egg yolks.

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:40.550
So in pastry, you're always
using egg yolks for the most

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:41.810
part, and you're always
trying to find something

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:43.170
to do with the egg whites.

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:46.880
So I feel like ice creams
use a lot of egg yolks,

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:49.420
and then meringues and
chiffon cakes and angel food

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:50.970
cakes use a lot of egg whites.

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:52.899
So you can make two.

00:15:52.899 --> 00:15:55.190
FEMALE SPEAKER: An angel food
cake and a giant custard.

00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:56.140
JOANNE CHANG: Exactly.

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:58.720
FEMALE SPEAKER: So if there
are questions in the audience,

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:02.150
there are microphones
set up in the aisles.

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:04.094
Please.

00:16:04.094 --> 00:16:06.930
AUDIENCE: When you
experiment with cooking,

00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:10.640
do you remember any really
big surprises where you didn't

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:13.310
think two things were going
to complement each other

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:15.340
or go together, and they
ended up being great?

00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:20.080
JOANNE CHANG: In
baking, you mean?

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:23.300
I do mostly dabbling
around in baking.

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:28.250
Let's see, two things that
combined that came out great.

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:32.001
Well, I was surprised
at this pumpkin thing--

00:16:32.001 --> 00:16:32.750
pumpkin and apple.

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:35.940
Even though pumpkin pie
and apple pie sound good,

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:37.700
I've never had
pumpkin apple pie.

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:39.950
So when I was doing
the cheesecake,

00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:42.047
I was trying to figure
out if-- I mean,

00:16:42.047 --> 00:16:43.130
it's a double-edged sword.

00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:45.040
You're adding the flavor
of apple to anything

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:46.706
that you sweeten with
apple juice, which

00:16:46.706 --> 00:16:48.840
is great, unless it
doesn't go well with apple.

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:51.290
So that actually ended
up being really great,

00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:54.160
because pumpkin is
really rich and earthy,

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:55.880
and apple is kind of acidic.

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.990
And so I often feel like
when I'm eating pumpkin,

00:16:57.990 --> 00:16:59.906
I want something a little
bit brighter anyway.

00:16:59.906 --> 00:17:03.220
And so by sweetening the pumpkin
with a little bit of apple,

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:05.824
for me it's a much more
rounded, balanced dessert.

00:17:05.824 --> 00:17:07.740
So that was something
that I wasn't expecting.

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:15.470
AUDIENCE: You were talking about
having to experiment about how

00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:17.109
white sugar is hygroscopic.

00:17:17.109 --> 00:17:19.500
And I was just curious,
did you play at all

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:22.849
with temperature for
things like baking cakes

00:17:22.849 --> 00:17:25.099
or whatnot at the
end so you could

00:17:25.099 --> 00:17:28.000
try and trap the
water at the tail-end

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.775
of the cooking process?

00:17:30.775 --> 00:17:33.150
JOANNE CHANG: Well, we did
experiment with a temperature,

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:36.720
just because there are things
that you still need them

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.130
to bake, but they don't brown.

00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:40.170
And so you're kind of adjusting.

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:42.200
And anything with
honey or maple,

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:46.660
you want to bake it a little bit
less, lower temperature anyway.

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:51.710
But the hygroscopic
is for when it's done,

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:53.410
and then it's sitting
on the counter

00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:55.240
or on the shelf or whatever.

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:58.790
That's when that element
comes into play more

00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:01.070
than in the baking in the oven.

00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:02.000
Does that make sense?

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.344
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:18:03.344 --> 00:18:05.010
So throwing it in the
freezer at the end

00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:06.930
wouldn't necessarily
help capture

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:09.855
the water inside of the cake?

00:18:09.855 --> 00:18:10.980
JOANNE CHANG: No, it would.

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:14.020
If you had a cake and
you wanted to delay

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:17.440
that evaporation
or the drying, you

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:19.970
could definitely slow it down
by putting it in the freezer,

00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:20.550
for sure.

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:22.474
Yeah.

00:18:22.474 --> 00:18:23.066
Yes?

00:18:23.066 --> 00:18:24.690
AUDIENCE: Thank you
so much for coming.

00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:27.480
And my question's
not about less sugar,

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:32.710
but one of my favorite treats
at Flour are the vegan muffins.

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:36.850
You have a vegan vanilla berry
and a vegan banana chocolate

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:37.350
chip.

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:40.770
And then any time I eat a
vegan treat anywhere else,

00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:43.054
it's really dry and gross.

00:18:43.054 --> 00:18:44.470
So I don't know
if it's a secret--

00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:47.064
JOANNE CHANG: I didn't pay
her to say that, I swear.

00:18:47.064 --> 00:18:48.730
AUDIENCE: I don't
know if it's a secret,

00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:50.600
but I've always
wondered what you

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:53.680
do with your vegan treats
to make them taste just as

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:55.190
good as some of the other ones?

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:56.770
JOANNE CHANG: Well, thank you.

00:18:56.770 --> 00:19:04.292
The vegan muffin recipe is in
the second book, "Flour, too."

00:19:04.292 --> 00:19:06.000
I don't know what
other people are doing,

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.941
but we just
substitute the things

00:19:07.941 --> 00:19:10.190
that-- I mean, if you're
vegan, then you already know.

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:15.010
Like instead of milk, we use
soy milk or coconut milk.

00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:18.380
Instead of butter, we use oil.

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:20.870
We didn't do anything
for the instead of eggs.

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:23.260
I think we just kind
of fiddled around

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:27.365
with the oil and the milk to
make it still liquid enough.

00:19:27.365 --> 00:19:31.520
But I don't know that we
did anything that magical.

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:32.560
There's no magic to it.

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:33.970
It's in the book.

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:39.080
When we do come up
with a new recipe,

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:41.440
we spend a lot of
time experimenting.

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:43.414
Everything is weighed
at the bakery.

00:19:43.414 --> 00:19:44.830
Everything is
weighed to the gram,

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:48.450
and we will literally change
things by 1% to 2% iteration

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:50.587
after iteration to get to
where we want it to be.

00:19:50.587 --> 00:19:52.170
In fact, there's an
email thread going

00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:53.470
on right now about
something that they're like,

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:54.580
should we up it 3%?

00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:56.330
And I was like, nope,
let's start with 3%.

00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:59.860
Let's try it first just 3%, and
then we'll see what happens.

00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:01.330
So there's a lot of testing.

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:03.660
So the recipe for
the vegan muffin

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:06.920
that you're talking about
went through many rounds

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:08.920
of maybe it started
out dry at one point,

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:10.980
and then we just added
more and more stuff.

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:11.813
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:20:11.813 --> 00:20:13.095
JOANNE CHANG: You're welcome.

00:20:13.095 --> 00:20:13.970
AUDIENCE: Hi, Joanne.

00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:15.819
Thanks so much for coming today.

00:20:15.819 --> 00:20:18.110
Curious if you can talk a
little bit about your process

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:20.560
for testing recipes
for a cookbook,

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:23.850
and if there's like an average
number of times you test,

00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:26.870
if you throw it to other
people to test to make sure

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:29.410
it's accessible for
the novice baker.

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:30.210
JOANNE CHANG: Sure.

00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:32.360
So if it's a recipe
that we already

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:34.680
have, like the
vegan muffin recipe,

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:38.080
which exists at the bakery,
basically what happens

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:40.540
is-- so everything's
in metric, and I just

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:43.980
reduce it to what seems like
a normal home size amount.

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:46.730
And then I'll test it myself.

00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:48.160
And I'll go through it once.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.660
But just because I
can do it, I know

00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:52.243
that that doesn't mean that it's
ready for the book, because I

00:20:52.243 --> 00:20:53.760
know what I'm
thinking, so I need

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:54.926
to give it to somebody else.

00:20:54.926 --> 00:20:57.130
So then a baker will test
it within the bakery,

00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:59.520
just to make sure that it's
kind of the right thing.

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:02.140
But even that doesn't
really work from a testing

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:04.330
perspective, because
all the bakers know me,

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:06.800
and they know what I mean
when I say, do this, do that.

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:10.370
So then we send it out.

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:13.480
Cambridge Culinary will
test recipes for us

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:14.770
for class credit.

00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:18.460
And so depending on
whatever semester,

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:21.090
I'll reach out to the
director and she'll put me

00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:22.390
in touch with that class.

00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:24.130
And they are on my
email list, and I say,

00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:27.284
here's a bunch of
recipes I need tested.

00:21:27.284 --> 00:21:29.450
And then I have a couple
testers who are just people

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:33.790
that I've worked closely
with who just test for me.

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:36.160
If it's something that
already exists at the bakery,

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:37.790
it doesn't take that
many iterations,

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:38.931
because we already do it.

00:21:38.931 --> 00:21:40.430
It's just a matter
of figuring out--

00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:43.110
like sometimes as you
reduce, reduce, reduce,

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:44.650
it reduces to a weird number.

00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:49.030
It reduces to like 1 cup plus
2 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon.

00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:51.810
And that's not
really that usable,

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:54.067
so I'll have to change
things around and change

00:21:54.067 --> 00:21:56.650
the proportions around just to
make sure that somebody at home

00:21:56.650 --> 00:21:58.810
can actually do it.

00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:03.620
But that usually takes
like one, maybe two tries.

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:07.500
But if it's a brand-new recipe,
like with the low sugar book,

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:10.440
I feel like those
recipes, a good recipe

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:14.510
would take four
iterations by me.

00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:16.930
So that's me trying it out
and then adjusting, adjusting,

00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:18.630
adjusting, and then by the
fourth time being like,

00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:19.664
OK, I think this works.

00:22:19.664 --> 00:22:22.080
Then I would give it to a baker
and then they would do it.

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:25.190
And usually, again, it
was almost the same thing

00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:25.950
as my doing it.

00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:28.200
They know me well enough
that they would just make it.

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.430
So that's like a fifth test.

00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:32.410
And then when we would
send it out to the testers.

00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:35.234
And usually from there,
I would say about 80%

00:22:35.234 --> 00:22:37.650
of the time it worked and 20%
of the time I'd get feedback

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:38.983
like, this isn't really working.

00:22:38.983 --> 00:22:40.080
So then we'd adjust it.

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:42.700
But by then, it was
usually just one iteration,

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:45.202
because I would get specific
feedback and I would say,

00:22:45.202 --> 00:22:46.910
ah, I knew that that
was going to happen.

00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:48.110
Let me adjust this.

00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:49.110
So that's a good recipe.

00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:51.445
A bad recipe-- or
not a bad recipe.

00:22:51.445 --> 00:22:52.840
No bad recipes.

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:55.190
A more challenging
recipe, probably more

00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:57.510
like eight or nine times.

00:22:57.510 --> 00:23:00.770
Again, because we're doing
things in such small--

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:03.150
in pastry, there are so many
things that you can vary,

00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:03.650
right?

00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:06.740
If you have 10 ingredients in
your thing, in your recipe,

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:10.530
and you're trying to make
it more moist or less

00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:13.319
sweet or whatever, if you
just adjust one thing,

00:23:13.319 --> 00:23:14.860
it's going to affect
everything else.

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:17.309
So what you want to do
is adjust everything,

00:23:17.309 --> 00:23:19.850
but then you don't know which
one of those adjustments worked

00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:20.600
and which one doesn't.

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:22.612
So you have to kind of go
slowly and say, well, I'm

00:23:22.612 --> 00:23:25.028
just going to reduce the eggs
from four eggs to three eggs

00:23:25.028 --> 00:23:26.540
and see what happens.

00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:28.900
Then you have to wait till
it bakes, wait till it cools,

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:31.150
try it, and then do it again.

00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:34.399
So it takes a lot of patience,
but it's a lot of fun.

00:23:34.399 --> 00:23:36.190
And there's a lot of
mistakes along the way

00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:39.060
that most people don't
view as mistakes.

00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:40.920
So people like to
eat the mistakes.

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:44.240
FEMALE SPEAKER: If you need to
testers for your next cookbook,

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:47.200
I'd be happy to send
recipes out to the office.

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:49.140
Our office is very
good with feedback.

00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:53.550
JOANNE CHANG: If you guys
want to test recipes, sure.

00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:57.260
AUDIENCE: I wondered
about convection oven

00:23:57.260 --> 00:23:59.930
versus conventional,
and which is your go-to

00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:03.790
and in what cases will you opt
for the other choice, and why?

00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:09.130
JOANNE CHANG: We use mostly
convection at this point,

00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:11.760
but it's for specific pastries.

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:17.030
So for cookies,
brioche, muffins,

00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:20.500
and tarts, tart shells,
we'll use convection.

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:23.780
And we'll use deck ovens,
or the still ovens,

00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:25.830
for things like bread and cakes.

00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:28.950
And the difference--
with the convection,

00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:30.910
you've got the fan
whirring around,

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:33.670
which is making the
temperature more consistent,

00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:37.460
but it is introducing the
element of movement and air.

00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:41.350
And so for a cookie or a
brioche or something that's

00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:44.155
relatively stable, I
don't mind that there's

00:24:44.155 --> 00:24:46.280
air blowing around, because
I just want it to bake,

00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:47.860
and I want it to bake
relatively evenly.

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:49.443
I don't want half
of the brioche to be

00:24:49.443 --> 00:24:51.850
under and half to be over.

00:24:51.850 --> 00:24:55.420
But a cake-- if you put a cake
in a convection oven, what

00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:59.180
tends to happen is that the cake
starts to cook on the outside,

00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:00.910
because you've got
this whirring fan.

00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:04.010
And then the inside is
still needing time to cook.

00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:06.990
And so the cake will
sometimes come out

00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:08.500
crispier on the outside.

00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:11.890
It'll finish baking on the
outside first, and by the time

00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:15.040
the inside is baked it'll be
over-baked on the outside.

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:17.030
So we have found
that the still ovens

00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:22.230
are better for baking cakes,
because it's slow, steady heat.

00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:25.249
There's no air that's trying
to basically form a crust.

00:25:25.249 --> 00:25:26.540
And that's the same with bread.

00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:28.500
If you put bread in
the convection oven,

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:33.430
the air will cause the skin
of the bread to crust, which

00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:36.340
means that as the yeast
is trying to expand

00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:38.770
and as the bread's trying
to get big and airy,

00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:40.910
it can't because it's
been crusted over.

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:44.230
So we prefer doing
that in a still oven.

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:46.730
And then even better is if you
can inject some steam in it--

00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:49.146
take a little water bottle and
put some steam-- it creates

00:25:49.146 --> 00:25:51.020
a really humid
environment for the bread,

00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:55.600
so then the bread dough stays
supple as the yeast is growing.

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:58.750
And then it doesn't crust over
until the yeast are all dead,

00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:00.820
and then you get
that crust that's

00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:02.700
characteristic of
really good bread.

00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:05.036
So that's how we differentiate.

00:26:05.036 --> 00:26:06.160
AUDIENCE: Great, thank you.

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:07.759
JOANNE CHANG: You're welcome.

00:26:07.759 --> 00:26:08.300
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:09.850
So I had a question
about how you

00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:11.762
decide which recipes to share.

00:26:11.762 --> 00:26:13.220
Do you have a
collection of recipes

00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:15.844
that you're never going to share
that are like the secret ones?

00:26:15.844 --> 00:26:17.530
JOANNE CHANG: Nope.

00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:19.080
The first book was
all the recipes

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:20.310
that we had at the time.

00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:22.292
And then since then,
we've done new things.

00:26:22.292 --> 00:26:24.750
And people will say, how come
you didn't share this recipe?

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:27.140
And I'll say, because we
hadn't made it at that point.

00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:29.079
And the same with
the second book.

00:26:29.079 --> 00:26:30.870
I put a bunch of salads
in the second book,

00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:33.120
and then we came up with a
new salad menu at the bakery,

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:35.105
and everyone's like, where's
the Green Goddess dressing?

00:26:35.105 --> 00:26:37.190
And I said, oh, we
hadn't made it by then.

00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:40.400
So the issue for us now is if
somebody wants a recipe that

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:41.760
hasn't been tested.

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:44.660
I can give you the recipe to
make like 10 gallons of Green

00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:47.610
Goddess, and if you want
to do the math-- or I

00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:50.140
can do the math as well and
just give it to you in grams.

00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:55.280
But I don't have home-friendly
recipes for everything,

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:57.430
so that's usually
the limiting factor.

00:26:57.430 --> 00:26:59.010
If somebody says,
I love this recipe.

00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:02.650
I'll just say to them, I can
give it to you in the big batch

00:27:02.650 --> 00:27:06.170
and I can do the math, just
divided it by 50 or whatever.

00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:08.850
But depending on
your comfort level,

00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:11.620
you can either use it
or it won't really help.

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:14.050
So I don't really
feel like recipes

00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:20.595
are meant to be-- I feel like
recipes are meant to be shared.

00:27:20.595 --> 00:27:21.970
A lot of that
comes from the fact

00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:25.100
that we obviously use the same
recipe at the bakery for all

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:26.250
of our items.

00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:29.810
Every baker has access
to the big recipe book.

00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:31.900
And it's crazy
the variation that

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:34.440
comes, even though
everything is weighed

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:38.900
to the gram and everything is
timed almost to the second.

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:41.470
And yet, we will still
have huge variations.

00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:44.407
Because to me, baking
isn't just about-- I mean,

00:27:44.407 --> 00:27:46.240
everyone talks about
how baking is chemistry

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:47.140
and it's so precise.

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:50.854
And it is, but it's also
so much about who you are

00:27:50.854 --> 00:27:53.270
and what you put into it, and
how you're feeling that day.

00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:54.910
I know this sounds
very touchy-feely,

00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:57.990
but I really feel like
pastry is something

00:27:57.990 --> 00:28:00.210
that you can tell if
somebody's doing it right

00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:01.660
and doing it well.

00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:05.880
And so giving somebody the
recipe isn't the secret.

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:07.900
It's all the
thought and the care

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:10.480
and the attention that goes into
making it that's the secret.

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:12.320
So I'm happy to
share all the recipes

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:16.197
and hope that everybody has
that same thought and care.

00:28:16.197 --> 00:28:17.030
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:18.210
JOANNE CHANG: You're welcome.

00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:20.220
FEMALE SPEAKER: I think we're
out of audience questions.

00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:21.860
I love that last
thing that you said,

00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:25.780
because I've always said
that my art is baking

00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:28.390
and that I put love into
everything that I make.

00:28:28.390 --> 00:28:30.040
And so I do that
for gifts for people

00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:31.956
for holidays and everything,
so it was awesome

00:28:31.956 --> 00:28:33.360
that you said that.

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:34.820
Thank you so much for coming.

00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:35.120
JOANNE CHANG: Thank you.

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:36.320
Thank you for having me.

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:39.370
[APPLAUSE]
