both man and beast and the creeping

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320

repent that I've made them but Noah

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330
repent that I've made them but Noah
 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.420
repent that I've made them but Noah
found grace in the eyes of the Lord okay

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430
found grace in the eyes of the Lord okay
 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.730
found grace in the eyes of the Lord okay
so that's an interesting thing so here

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740
so that's an interesting thing so here
 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.380
so that's an interesting thing so here
what we have is the question is the

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390
what we have is the question is the
 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.060
what we have is the question is the
whole worlds in chaos at this point

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070
whole worlds in chaos at this point
 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.189
whole worlds in chaos at this point
right in this point the story and the

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199
right in this point the story and the
 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.679
right in this point the story and the
chaos is of multiple sorts it arose from

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689
chaos is of multiple sorts it arose from
 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.749
chaos is of multiple sorts it arose from
the fall it rose from the emergence of

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759
the fall it rose from the emergence of
 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.209
the fall it rose from the emergence of
self-consciousness it emerged safe arose

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219
self-consciousness it emerged safe arose
 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.430
self-consciousness it emerged safe arose
from the sins of Cain like things are

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440
from the sins of Cain like things are
 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.560
from the sins of Cain like things are
not going well it's multiple levels of

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570
not going well it's multiple levels of
 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.420
not going well it's multiple levels of
collapse and it's got to the point where

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430
collapse and it's got to the point where
 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.190
collapse and it's got to the point where
God saying this is a mess like it's such

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200
God saying this is a mess like it's such
 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.930
God saying this is a mess like it's such
a mess that the whole thing has to be

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940
a mess that the whole thing has to be
 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.240
a mess that the whole thing has to be
washed away the first fall wasn't enough

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250
washed away the first fall wasn't enough
 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.369
washed away the first fall wasn't enough
even Cain's collapse wasn't enough we're

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379
even Cain's collapse wasn't enough we're
 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.990
even Cain's collapse wasn't enough we're
going to just scrub the whole bloody

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000
going to just scrub the whole bloody
 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.869
going to just scrub the whole bloody
thing clean so it's it's the ultimate in

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879
thing clean so it's it's the ultimate in
 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.900
thing clean so it's it's the ultimate in
traumatic collapses the question is well

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910
traumatic collapses the question is well
 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.430
traumatic collapses the question is well
what do you do in the face of the

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440
what do you do in the face of the
 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.060
what do you do in the face of the
ultimate in traumatic collapses and the

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070
ultimate in traumatic collapses and the
 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.799
ultimate in traumatic collapses and the
answer is in the story so Noah as

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809
answer is in the story so Noah as
 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.080
answer is in the story so Noah as
someone who finds fate who finds favor

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090
someone who finds fate who finds favor
 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.570
someone who finds fate who finds favor
in the eyes of God so he's like Abel

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580
in the eyes of God so he's like Abel
 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.250
in the eyes of God so he's like Abel
there's something that Noah's doing

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260
there's something that Noah's doing
 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.440
there's something that Noah's doing
right it's going to enable him to ride

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450
right it's going to enable him to ride
 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.170
right it's going to enable him to ride
out the storm and so the question hits

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180
out the storm and so the question hits
 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.420
out the storm and so the question hits
the same question do you want to have a

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430
the same question do you want to have a
 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.050
the same question do you want to have a
life where there's no storms or do you

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060
life where there's no storms or do you
 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.399
life where there's no storms or do you
want to have a life where you can ride

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409
want to have a life where you can ride
 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.609
want to have a life where you can ride
out the storms that's the issue right

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619
out the storms that's the issue right
 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.380
out the storms that's the issue right
are you behind the dykes or do you build

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390
are you behind the dykes or do you build
 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.060
are you behind the dykes or do you build
a boat do you captain the boat that's

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070
a boat do you captain the boat that's
 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.249
a boat do you captain the boat that's
the same idea and so the idea here is

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259
the same idea and so the idea here is
 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.350
the same idea and so the idea here is
that the thing that rides out the chaos

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360
that the thing that rides out the chaos
 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.210
that the thing that rides out the chaos
is the thing that builds and captain's

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220
is the thing that builds and captain's
 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.160
is the thing that builds and captain's
the boat it's another dominance

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170
the boat it's another dominance
 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.050
the boat it's another dominance
hierarchy idea what should be at the top

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060
hierarchy idea what should be at the top
 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.749
hierarchy idea what should be at the top
well it's it's the top of something that

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759
well it's it's the top of something that
 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.429
well it's it's the top of something that
doesn't get flooded out as well what

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439
doesn't get flooded out as well what
 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.469
doesn't get flooded out as well what
should be at the top well it's to be the

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479
should be at the top well it's to be the
 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.999
should be at the top well it's to be the
boat builder and to be the captain of

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009
boat builder and to be the captain of
 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.280
boat builder and to be the captain of
the boat it's not to be hidden from the

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290
the boat it's not to be hidden from the
 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.330
the boat it's not to be hidden from the
flood precisely and so I mean here's a

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340
flood precisely and so I mean here's a
 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.730
flood precisely and so I mean here's a
here's here's something to think about

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740
here's here's something to think about
 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.679
here's here's something to think about
identity identity politics because

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689
identity identity politics because
 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.410
identity identity politics because
that's what we're up to our neck it okay

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420
that's what we're up to our neck it okay
 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.440
that's what we're up to our neck it okay
are you who you are

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450
are you who you are
 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.660
are you who you are
can i box you in will you accept that as

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670
can i box you in will you accept that as
 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.429
can i box you in will you accept that as
an identity so I could do that lots of

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439
an identity so I could do that lots of
 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.410
an identity so I could do that lots of
ways you're male you're Asian you're

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420
ways you're male you're Asian you're
 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.479
ways you're male you're Asian you're
young right there's things about you

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489
young right there's things about you
 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.170
young right there's things about you
that I can derive

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180
that I can derive
 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.059
that I can derive
because of your putative membership in a

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069
because of your putative membership in a
 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.819
because of your putative membership in a
set of different groups the problem with

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:17.829
set of different groups the problem with
 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:19.709
set of different groups the problem with
doing that is that the number of groups

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:19.719
doing that is that the number of groups
 

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:22.640
doing that is that the number of groups
that I can assign you to is without end

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650
that I can assign you to is without end
 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.649
that I can assign you to is without end
so I have to pick arbitrary groups to

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:25.659
so I have to pick arbitrary groups to
 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:27.539
so I have to pick arbitrary groups to
assign you to and you can accept that if

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549
assign you to and you can accept that if
 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:29.190
assign you to and you can accept that if
you want but there's no evidence that

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200
you want but there's no evidence that
 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.780
you want but there's no evidence that
those are the proper canonical groups

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790
those are the proper canonical groups
 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.399
those are the proper canonical groups
but maybe you're happy about that

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:32.409
but maybe you're happy about that
 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:33.599
but maybe you're happy about that
because now you've been assigned

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:33.609
because now you've been assigned
 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:35.520
because now you've been assigned
membership in a group and that's your

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530
membership in a group and that's your
 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.629
membership in a group and that's your
identity okay so the question is well

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:38.639
identity okay so the question is well
 

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:41.959
identity okay so the question is well
fine what happens when that identity is

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:41.969
fine what happens when that identity is
 

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:48.390
fine what happens when that identity is
flown into pieces then what well here's

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400
flown into pieces then what well here's
 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.550
flown into pieces then what well here's
here's the answer to some degree and

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560
here's the answer to some degree and
 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.220
here's the answer to some degree and
this is the answer that's embedded in

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230
this is the answer that's embedded in
 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.289
this is the answer that's embedded in
the story of Noah if you wanted

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299
the story of Noah if you wanted
 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:01.979
the story of Noah if you wanted
withstand chaos do you want to be who

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989
withstand chaos do you want to be who
 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.319
withstand chaos do you want to be who
you are or do you want to be the thing

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:04.329
you are or do you want to be the thing
 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:06.500
you are or do you want to be the thing
that changes who you are constantly

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510
that changes who you are constantly
 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.059
that changes who you are constantly
that's the question and that's the

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069
that's the question and that's the
 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:10.319
that's the question and that's the
difference that's the difference there's

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:10.329
difference that's the difference there's
 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:12.390
difference that's the difference there's
a categorical difference in identity are

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400
a categorical difference in identity are
 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.500
a categorical difference in identity are
you who you are

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510
you who you are
 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.690
you who you are
or are you the thing that could

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700
or are you the thing that could
 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.640
or are you the thing that could
continually be more than you are and

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650
continually be more than you are and
 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.099
continually be more than you are and
that's the thing that isn't the stable

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109
that's the thing that isn't the stable
 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:23.280
that's the thing that isn't the stable
identity it's not the initial state it's

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290
identity it's not the initial state it's
 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.619
identity it's not the initial state it's
also not the state of being in chaos

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:25.629
also not the state of being in chaos
 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:28.080
also not the state of being in chaos
that nihilistic state let's say and it's

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090
that nihilistic state let's say and it's
 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.819
that nihilistic state let's say and it's
not even the state of reformulations

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829
not even the state of reformulations
 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:31.469
not even the state of reformulations
that occurs after you've gone through

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:31.479
that occurs after you've gone through
 

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:33.599
that occurs after you've gone through
the process it's the state of

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:33.609
the process it's the state of
 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:35.580
the process it's the state of
continually going through the process so

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590
continually going through the process so
 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.589
continually going through the process so
you can identify with the thing that

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599
you can identify with the thing that
 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:40.379
you can identify with the thing that
trends you can identify identify with

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:40.389
trends you can identify identify with
 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:41.939
trends you can identify identify with
the thing that you are or you can

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:41.949
the thing that you are or you can
 

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:44.099
the thing that you are or you can
identify with the thing that transforms

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:44.109
identify with the thing that transforms
 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:47.460
identify with the thing that transforms
who you are right and that's the same as

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470
who you are right and that's the same as
 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.140
who you are right and that's the same as
the state subjugating itself to the

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150
the state subjugating itself to the
 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.789
the state subjugating itself to the
individual because the individual is the

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799
individual because the individual is the
 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:53.219
individual because the individual is the
thing that transforms the state and what

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:53.229
thing that transforms the state and what
 

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:54.869
thing that transforms the state and what
the state should do the states necessary

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:54.879
the state should do the states necessary
 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:56.729
the state should do the states necessary
because obviously it organizes all of us

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739
because obviously it organizes all of us
 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:59.009
because obviously it organizes all of us
into peaceful cooperation and

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019
into peaceful cooperation and
 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:01.469
into peaceful cooperation and
competition the states necessary then

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:01.479
competition the states necessary then
 

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:03.330
competition the states necessary then
the question is is the state the highest

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340
the question is is the state the highest
 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.550
the question is is the state the highest
good and the answer that is well it

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560
good and the answer that is well it
 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.559
good and the answer that is well it
can't be because it's old and dead and

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569
can't be because it's old and dead and
 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:09.899
can't be because it's old and dead and
blind and so if the state becomes the

00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:09.909
blind and so if the state becomes the
 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:12.059
blind and so if the state becomes the
highest good then you're occupied by the

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:12.069
highest good then you're occupied by the
 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:14.129
highest good then you're occupied by the
spirit of something that's old and dead

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:14.139
spirit of something that's old and dead
 

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:17.069
spirit of something that's old and dead
and blind well that's not only not good

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079
and blind well that's not only not good
 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:18.870
and blind well that's not only not good
for you because then you're old and dead

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880
for you because then you're old and dead
 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.729
for you because then you're old and dead
and blind but it's also bad for the

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739
and blind but it's also bad for the
 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.469
and blind but it's also bad for the
state because as soon as the state gets

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479
state because as soon as the state gets
 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:25.200
state because as soon as the state gets
old and dead and blind God gets unhappy

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210
old and dead and blind God gets unhappy
 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.470
old and dead and blind God gets unhappy
with it and the chaos comes in

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480
with it and the chaos comes in
 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.720
with it and the chaos comes in
washes it away so it seems like a bad

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:28.730
washes it away so it seems like a bad
 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.620
washes it away so it seems like a bad
solution so what's the proper solution

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630
solution so what's the proper solution
 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.480
solution so what's the proper solution
you subordinate your group identity to

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490
you subordinate your group identity to
 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.100
you subordinate your group identity to
the identity that transforms your

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110
the identity that transforms your
 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.280
the identity that transforms your
identity right and the state

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290
identity right and the state
 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.530
identity right and the state
subordinates its power to the vision and

subordinates its power to the vision and
articulation of the individual because

articulation of the individual because
 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.850
articulation of the individual because
that's what revives the state and so

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860
that's what revives the state and so
 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.920
that's what revives the state and so
that's what these stories are trying to

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930
that's what these stories are trying to
 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.700
that's what these stories are trying to
stumble towards roughly speaking
