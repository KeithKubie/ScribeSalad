00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.830
The future of manufacturing is
gonna be this convergence of

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.580
the digitization of technology,
with what's needed in manufacturing.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.682
And that's going to create
greater productivity.

00:00:12.682 --> 00:00:17.770
It's gonna create the ability to customize
products and do it very quickly.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.620
&gt;&gt; Robotics up until now have been caged,
they've been isolated.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.520
I think in the future of robotics, they're
going to expand out in processes not only

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.720
within facilities, but between facilities.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.550
&gt;&gt; We're looking for
collaborative technologies for robots and

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.350
things to operate
together to conduct these

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.720
challenges within
the manufacturing environment.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.000
The ARM Institute's
mission is to bring back

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.180
more manufacturing to the United States,
and

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.900
also to grow new types of
manufacturing in the United States.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:52.000
Carnegie Mellon has already demonstrated
an extraordinary leadership in

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.680
helping to shape the agenda for
manufacturing.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.290
&gt;&gt; Carnegie Mellon is a critical
part of our efforts to develop and

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.110
promote an advanced manufacturing and
robotics sector in our community.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.370
We believe we can be the test bed for
the rest of the country.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.760
&gt;&gt; Having Carnegie Mellon
leading the arm and

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.050
technology maturation generates
incredible job growth within Pittsburgh.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.110
You're already starting to
see the inflow of talent.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.160
&gt;&gt; It puts us right in the middle of
basic research with academia, and

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.650
it's the best in the world
that we can have access to.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.250
And it would be difficult to find and
have access to that on our own.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.230
&gt;&gt; It's taken innovation all
the way through its research and

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.310
engineering phases to product.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.090
&gt;&gt; We believe in the mission, which is to
use automation and robotic technologies,

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.092
artificial intelligence to make
manufacture in the U.S. more competitive.

00:01:43.092 --> 00:01:47.690
&gt;&gt; Carnegie Mellon has already, and
will continue, to play a very strong role.

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.550
They have some of the world's leading
experts in the types of technologies

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.140
that are driving manufacturing success.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.120
&gt;&gt; We're going to continue to draw more
people that want to build a company

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.530
around robotics technology.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:01.830
&gt;&gt; The future's here now.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.020
&gt;&gt; We're very excited about the fact that
Carnegie Mellon and the ARM institute have

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.870
combined together to enable this first
building at the Hazelwood Green site.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.622
&gt;&gt; This is a really exciting time to
be in manufacturing in the US and

00:02:15.622 --> 00:02:18.204
especially here in the Pittsburgh region.

00:02:18.204 --> 00:02:20.690
It's really exciting to be
part of this revolution.
