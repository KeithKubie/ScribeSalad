00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.960
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it so you don't have to.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:06.640
Well...

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.180
Christmas is over, Santa has come, and...

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.320
I guess I got a little bit of a post-Christmas blues. I mean...

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:19.500
12 months waiting, weeks upon weeks of hoping for the world's greatest Christmas gifts, and what did I get?

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:26.500
A Nintendo Wii entertainment system, two fully-functional controllers, the latest edition of Super Smash Bros. Brawl...

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.080
and no Mario Kart?

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.000
Suck my candy cane, Santa! That was the cream of the yuletide crop, and you knew it!

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.400
Instead, what did I get in my stocking?

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.920
A holly, jolly dose of BULLSHIT known as "Jingle All the Way"'.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.900
The first and, thank God, only Christmas film to star international punch line Arnold Schwarzenegger.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.600
And since I got the post-Christmas blues, you're gonna share this hunk of stinking yellow snow with me.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.420
So! Grab your vomit bags and get ready to find out

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.380
oh what fun it is to ride in a horse-shit-spewing fuck ride like this one!

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:59.480
Let's take a look.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.240
So, it starts out with a show called "Turbo Man".

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.720
I'd say it's like Power Rangers for younger kids, but it's more like Power Rangers for retarded kids.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.320
I mean, I think this is the film's first big hole:

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.740
No normal, functioning kid would actually watch this intergalactic space crap.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.160
I mean, seriously, what kid would watch a show with a flying, hunchback saber tooth Care Bear in it?

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.800
Well, apparently, this kid would: a little boy named Jamie played by Jake Lloyd.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.840
Jake Lloyd. Hmm. Now, where do I know that name?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
[Dun dun DUNNN!!!]

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.800
Oh! Ah! AHHH!!!

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.580
[Glass breaks]
[Critic screams while falling]

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:35.360
[Thud]

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.740
My god, what a tall building!

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.880
He's upset because his father is a workaholic played by Arnold Schwarzenegger.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.280
I'd just be upset if my father was Arnold Schwarzenegger.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.940
The last straw is when Arnold misses his son's karate graduation.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.320
Arnold tries to make it but is caught in traffic and is also stopped by the world's oldest policeman.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.660
{Look, sir, I'm in kind of a hurry.}

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.420
Oh, well, if you're in a [thick accent] "hur-ray".

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.160
Arnold tries to "hur-ray" up but ultimately misses the ceremony.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.040
{I didn't make it.}

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.140
Thanks... Arnold. I never would have figured that out if you didn't say something.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.860
What is this? Movies for the blind?

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.940
[As Arnold Schwarzenegger]
"I'm walking down the hallway. I stop to catch my breath.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.040
"I look into an empty room with a janitor to emphasize what a douche bag I am."

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.360
{I didn't make it.}

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.820
Things don't get much better when his next-door-neighbor, played by Phil Hartman, starts becoming more fatherly than he does.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.560
{Sorry you missed the karate class today, but don't worry. I got it all on video for ya.}

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.260
[As Phil Hartman]
"Hi. I'm Troy McClure!

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.360
"You may remember me from such horrible Christmas classics as 'Here Comes Stephen Segal'...

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.340
'Frosty the Van Damme', and 'The Stalone Who Stole Christmas'!"

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.440
Arnold tries to apologize to his son, but Jamie's heart has been broken too many times for him to listen.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.360
{Jamie! Don't walk away from your father!}

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.620
[As Arnold Schwarzenegger]
"You will come to me, Jaime! Or I will destroy you!

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.740
"BLAAAGH!"

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.820
{Is this it? Wow!}

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.640
{THIS... is really cool. What do you think, Jamie?}

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.740
[Karate yells]

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.880
And this guy was a multi-million-dollar action star.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.220
Life is stupid.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.620
But Arnold, still feeling bad, tries to find a way to make it up to his son.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.500
{If there's something really important you've been wanting for Christmas...}

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.520
[As Jake Lloyd]
"Well, I've always wanted to ruin a Star Wars Movie."

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:23.780
{I want the Turbo Man action figure with the arms and legs that move, and the boomerang shooter, and the rockin', roaring jetpack...}

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.940
{You'll shoot your eye out, kid!}

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.980
{Johnny's gonna get one, and so is everybody else I know! Whoever doesn't is gonna be a real loser.}

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.420
{Well, it definitely won't be you.}

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.200
{Thanks, Dad! I love you.}

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.460
Aw! Materialism brings everybody together. That's what Christmas is all about!

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.840
There's only one problem, though: Arnold doesn't have the doll.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.780
{Which reminds me: You got the doll, right?}

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.360
{The doll!}

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.040
I love how the wife isn't even really acting here.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.800
She's just preparing for the world's most unconvincing head duck for the camera.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.220
She does it so fast, I wonder if she hits her head on the sink.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.660
{You got the doll, right?}

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:03.720
[BAM!]

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.340
[Forceful exhale]
That's gonna hurt.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.840
I also love this over-the-top expression that Arnold gives that looks like the cliff hanger of a horrible 80s sitcom.

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.460
{Because, at this point, they'd probably be impossible to find.}

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.320
"Uh oh! How's Arnold gonna get out of this one?

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:23.940
"Will he have time to get the gift? Or will the most unpractical and implausible of hi-jinks ensue?

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.480
"Tune in next time when Master-Piece-Of-Shit Theater continues!"

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.320
We find out, though, that while Arnold has to get the doll,

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.180
he might miss the Christmas parade that they always go to. But Arnold reassures his son.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.860
{I'll be there. I promise.}

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.000
Am I the only one who thinks this touching moment looks relatively threatening?

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.400
{I'll be there.}

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.700
[Deep, demonic voice]
"I promise."

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.560
[As Arnold Schwarzenegger]
"I will eat you, Jamie!"

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.200
[Vicious growling]

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.360
While waiting in line at the toy store, he comes across a mailman who's looking for the same toy,

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.060
played by the thankfully underappreciated Sinbad.

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.980
{They spend billions of dollars on TV advertisement,}

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.900
{and then they sit there and use subliminal messages to suck your children's minds out!}

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.940
If you were somehow blessed with not remembering this early-90s rape of comedy,

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.100
consider that your own personal Chrstimas gift.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:18.060
Oh, okay, he's not that bad, but he does seem to have this unique talent of just sucking the comedy out of a scene.

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.940
Even if there's no comedy to be found.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:26.400
{And then, they sit there and make your kid feel like garbage if you, the father, who's workin' 24/7 delivering mail}

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.980
{so you can make an alimony payment to a woman that slept with everybody at the post office but me!}

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:37.820
You hear that lack of joy and laughter that most people hear when certain comedians are around?

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.140
THAT... is the power of Sinbad.

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.580
They try to go and get the doll, but it turns out the store is all out.

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.380
{I'm trying to find a Turbo Man doll.}

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.740
[Wheezing laughter]

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.200
{These guy are looking for a... Turbo Man?}
{A Turbo Man doll.}

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.020
[Loud laughter]

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.900
{Turbo Man is only the hottest-selling Christmas toy, ever! Duh!}

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.580
"And I think I'm having a psychotic episode. Duh!"

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:00.360
[Goofy chuckling]

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.300
{Where is your Christmas spirit?}

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.540
That's the Arnold we all know and love! Now squash their heads like grapefruit!

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:09.660
Pussy!

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.280
He spots someone driving away with it,

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:15.100
but, unfortunately, the driver recognizes Schwarzenegger and correctly steps on the gas.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.320
Arnold goes from store to store, trying to find a Turbo Man, but comes out empty-handed.

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:24.140
He takes his frustration out on a cardboard cutout as it's the only performance that's more wooden than his.

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.380
[As Arnold Schwarzenegger]
"I will destroy you, cardboard!"

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:31.200
[Growling and yelling]

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:36.620
As if we didn't have enough annoying performances, Phil Hartman comes in again to put the moves on Arnold's wife.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:41.220
{It's Christmas Eve and you're slaving over a hot stove. Is this the Mom of the Year or what?}

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.900
{It's no big deal.}
{And modest, too.}

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.220
[As Phil Hartman]
"You know I'm the antagonist in this picture because

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:51.380
"all poorly-written antagonists always talk in a slimy,  over-the-top voice."

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.180
[Creepy groaning]

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.860
Things get even worse when Arnold tries to call his wife and instead gets Nasty McJackass on the line.

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:02.060
{Ted, I need to speak to my wife.}

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.460
{I think she's in the shower, Howard. You want me to go check?}

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:05.120
{NO!}

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.900
[As Arnold Schwarzenegger]
"You stay away from my wife! Or I'll eat you!"

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.260
{Your wife's cookies are out of this world!}

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:11.860
{Who told you you could eat my cookies?}

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:13.860
"You stay away from my cookies!"

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:17.060
{OH, THESE COOKIES! I gotta get the recipe from Liz.}

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:18.380
{PUT THAT COOKIE DOWN!}

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:23.100
"Stay away from my wife, stay way from my cookies, and stay away from my wife's cookies!

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:24.580
"OR I DESTROY YOU!"

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:26.400
{There's the next batch. Gotta go, Howard.}

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.380
[Stammers]
[Dial tone]

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.720
"COOKIIIIIIIES!!!"

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.460
{Hey! Hey! Hey! look who it is!}

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:36.500
Oh, good! For a second there, I started tolerating the art of film-making.

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.780
{You and I, we're the same kind of person.}

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.120
[Laughing]
Yeah, except, uh, he's successful and you're not.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:44.420
{Late delivery of Turbo Men at Toy Horse!}

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:45.480
God!

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:49.400
At the store, unfortunately, they hand out colored balls that will take place in a drawing

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.360
that will decide who gets the toy and who doesn't.

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:57.640
{If you're not one of the lucky few, we have PLENTY of Turbo Man's faithful pet tiger, Booster, in stock.}

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.980
[As Arnold Schwarzenegger]
"Fuck Booster! Give me the Turbo Man, you girly man!"

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:05.120
Things get ugly when the mob breaks out and Sinbad steals the ball away from Arnold.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:09.240
{HE GOT TWO! HE GOT TWO!}
{GET THE MAILMAN!}

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:12.200
[As Arnold Schwarzenegger]
"Destroy him! Destroy him then eat him!"

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:18.340
Unfortunately, the ball moves a lot like Flubber as it keeps getting higher and higher the more times it bounces around.

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:20.020
It falls into the hands of a...

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:25.140
genderly undefinable child... as Arnold roams through the mall's playground to get it back.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:32.280
[As Arnold Schwarzenegger]
"Out of my way, children! Or I eat you! I eat you all!"

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:36.200
{Hi, little girl!}

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.540
Girl! That's what it was.

00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:40.020
{No! Give me the ball!}

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:44.880
Fortunately, more people recognize Arnold and give him the proper greeting that he's used to...

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:49.200
which still means no Turbo man, but hope comes in the shape of a Belushi.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.740
{You want a Turbo Man for Christmas?}

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:52.740
{Forget it. I'm not gonna sit in YOUR lap!}

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:53.940
{That's not my bag.}

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:57.120
Oh, hey! A gay joke in a children's film. Merry Christmas.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:02.500
He tells him where he can get a Turbo Man at this sort of underground, disgruntled Santa workshop

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:05.020
where they sell hard-to-find toys at outrageous prices.

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:09.260
But Arnold is given a false product as he tries to escape the workshop without paying.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:13.260
But this is harder than it seems as Arnold's confronted by dozens of Santas,

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:18.020
killer elves, and even a ninja that uses candy canes as nunchucks.

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:23.300
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Idiot Land!

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:26.820
Where nothing is too ridiculous or too insulting to anyone's intelligence.

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:30.040
Want to see Arnold fight homicidal Santa Clauses with a candy cane?

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:32.580
Nothing is too hard for us in Idiot Land.

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.740
Want to see a musclebound giant hit a little person across the room?

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.600
In the realms of Idiot Land, anything is possible.

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.640
Idiot Land. It's full of...

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:44.060
IDIOTS!

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:49.460
So Arnold finally escapes and calls his son to let him know the bad news that not only did he not get the doll,

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.620
but he probably won't be able to make it to the parade.

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:55.260
{When someone makes a promise, they definitely should keep it.}

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.860
{You know, it's like what Turbo Man says.}

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:01.480
{"Always keep your promises if you want to keep your friends."}

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.840
[As Jake Lloyd]
"Yay! I'm acting!"

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:08.220
{What would you know about keeping your promises?! You never keep your promises!}

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:11.780
{You never do ANYTHING you say you're gonna do! EVER!}

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:14.160
[As Jake Lloyd]
"Well, that just puckers my lips!"

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:16.160
[Calmly]
{Damn you, Howard.}

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:18.540
Gee, that wasn't over-dramatic.

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:20.500
{Damn you, Howard.}

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:22.040
[As Rita Wilson]
"Damn you."

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.100
"Damn you."

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:26.220
[Phone rings]

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:27.120
"Hello?"

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.680
"My pizza's gonna be late?"

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:32.180
"Damn you."

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:37.720
Because the pits of Hell decided we haven't suffered enough, we get ANOTHER appearance by Sinbad

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:40.120
as he tries to patch things up with Arnold once more.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:44.700
{I remember one Christmas, I wanted this one, special toy: Johnny Seven OMA gun.}

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:46.420
{You remember those, don't you?}
{No.}

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:48.440
{I still remember the commercial like it was yesterday.}

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:52.320
Gee, would you be so kind as to, uh, NOT reenact it for us?

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.560
{"Johnny to Peter, Johnny to Peter. Enemies sighted."}

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:55.800
{"Roger that!"}

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:58.920
Oh... God, I hate you.

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.220
{... one-man-army gun.}

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:03.300
[As Rita Wilson]
"Damn you. Damn you!"

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.220
Wondering how much he's getting paid for this movie,

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:09.780
Arnold suddenly looks over and imagines his son having a very similar future.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:11.880
{Here's to you, Dad.}

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:19.160
[As Arnold Schwarzenegger]
"Dear God! My son is going to grow up to be an unsuccessful, unfunny black man!"

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:26.380
But the chase continues as they rush into a radio station that apparently gives out the Turbo Man to anyone who can answer a holiday question.

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:28.280
But that turns out to be bogus, too.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:31.140
So the police come in, thank God, to try and take him away.

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:35.060
But Sinbad tries to get out of it by taking one of his packages and pretending it's a bomb.

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:36.120
{Ciao, baby.}

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:39.840
{You shouldn't mess with that.}

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:42.760
[Gentlemen... we've been duped.}

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:43.740
[Sighs of relief]

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:45.980
[Explosion]

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:50.180
{That was really a bomb? This is a SICK world we're living in! SICK people!}

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:54.200
[Chuckling]
That was actually kinda funny.

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:57.000
[Laughing]
This movie actually had a funny moment in it!

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.340
Look! I'm smiling! I'm actually smiling!

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:04.360
[Laughing harder]
This movie actually had a really funny scene!

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:07.680
[Laughing]

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.720
[Cops coughing]

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.420
{How many years in the bomb squad?}

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:12.880
[Forced laughter]

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:17.260
No. No, you're ruining the joke! Don't ruin the one funny scene you have in this movie!

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:22.980
[Insane laughter turns into yelling]

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.080
You did it! You actually did it!

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:29.460
You ruined the only funny joke in the movie, you jingle balls of ass!

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:33.980
DAMN YOU! DAMN YOU ALL TO HELL!
[Sobbing]

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:39.160
Arnold stoops to the ultimate low as he tries to steal a Turbo Man from Phil Hartman's house.

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:43.400
But, luckily, a psychotic, blood-hungry reindeer hunts him down to make sure he doesn't get away with it.

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.360
Hey, don't look at me! I didn't write it.

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:49.420
His wife finally decides to take her son to the parade, leaving Arnold behind.

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:52.620
{Ted, would you drive us?}
{Of course.}

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.320
{You can't bench press your way out of this one.}

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.440
Arnold searches for the appropriate response.

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:06.140
{Fuck you, asshole.}

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:09.340
Oh, it turns out the reindeer is still hungry for Austrian meat.

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:13.900
[Groans in pain]

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:17.540
Oh, good. What do you think the big, witty Schwarzenegger line is gonna be?

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:19.540
{You started it.}

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:22.760
[Stammers]
What? That's all you got?

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:26.400
Come on! You're Arnold Schwarzenegger! You're a professional at this!

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:29.380
Come on! There's a million better witty lines you could say, like...

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:31.800
Or...

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:35.500
Or, if you're really desperate...

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.580
Just show us that you're trying!

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:42.660
So they show up to the parade of the only affordable copyrighted characters they could get,

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:45.380
where Arnold tries one more time to set things right.

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:48.180
Here, he's mistaken for a stuntman/actor.

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:49.180
Isn't he already?

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:53.400
Where he's slipped into - here's a big shocker - a Turbo Man outfit.

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:58.340
I guess it figures. Arnold already resembles an inanimate object that shouts nothing but corny catchphrases.

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:00.840
[Arnold]
{I know you! You're Booster!}

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:05.200
[Man in Booster suit]
{Yeah! And who the hell do you think you are? Mary Poppins?!}

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:08.980
Eww. That's an image: Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mary Poppins.

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:11.780
Eww! Deleted!

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:14.300
Arnold also partakes in, get this,

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:20.140
a special part of the parade where he hands out a Turbo Man doll to a special child in the audience.

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:22.820
Gee. I wonder who it could be.

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:24.220
[Amplified]
{JAMIE!}

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:29.340
{He knows my name.}

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:33.180
[As Jake Lloyd]
"And he has a thick, Austrian accent for some reason."

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:38.560
So Jamie marches up there and collects his prize and has the greatest Christmas Day ever.

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:42.720
Right. Yeah. I know the routine. Yeah.

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:46.180
I'm gonna say something like, "Well, that wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:48.580
"I mean it was bad, but it wasn't horrible."

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:52.880
And then? The movie's gonna surprise me with the shittiest part of the entire film!

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:55.200
Well, I'm not gonna fall for it. Nope.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:59.440
I'm betting you anything that this is not the end of the movie.

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:01.740
{Merry Christmas, Jamie.}

00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:05.480
Nope. Nope. Not the end. Not the end.

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:07.640
{Liza, I think Turbo Man has selected a winner.}

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:11.080
Really?

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:13.780
No surprises, or anything?

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:20.060
No last-minute climax? No cheasy, over-the-top special effects?

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:24.120
Really?

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:29.460
Okay. Alright. I mean...

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:31.700
It's true. It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:34.180
I mean it was bad, but not nearly as horrible as--

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:36.500
[Female host]
{It's Turbo Man's archenemy!}

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.880
FUCK YOU, MOVIE! FUCK YOU! FUCK YOU! FUCK YOU! FUCK YOU! FUCK YOU! FUCK YOU!

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:45.640
So Sinbad comes in, dressed up as Turbo Man's arch nemesis, the Green Dildo.

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:48.760
{Come on, Myron. You're taking this too far.}

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:52.880
Yes, listen to the person dressed up as Turbo Man. He's not taking anything too far.

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:56.340
So the boy runs away with the doll as Sinbad tries to get it from him.

00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:59.840
Everybody just applauds as they assume this is all just part of the act.

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:02.800
{This could be the end of civilization as we know it.}

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.260
No argument here.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:05.780
[What'ya gonna do now, kid?!}

00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:13.500
[As Arnold Schwarzenegger]
"That's right, Jamie! Kick him in the balls! They are man's greatest design flaw!"

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:19.860
So Jamie actually climbs up a tall building all because he can't give away his beloved, fucking Turbo Man.

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:23.860
{Alright, kid. End of the line! Just give me the doll!}
{Never!}

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:27.260
[As Jake Lloyd]
"I would sooner die than part with my commercial piece of plastic!"

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:32.460
Okay, kid. There's liking a toy, and then there's insanely obsessing over a toy!

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:36.620
I mean, your life isn't worth it. Just give him the damn plushie, you little moron!

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:42.680
By the way, has anyone noticed that this is the longest stopped-parade stunt in the history of implausibility?

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:46.380
"Well, at the rate this parade is going, Santa should float by in roughly...

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.120
"12 hours."

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:50.720
{Fly, Turbo Man! Use your jetpack!}

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.700
{It's Turbo Ti-}
[Screaming]

00:16:58.280 --> 00:16:59.040
{Wow!}

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.820
So let me get this straight...

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:06.880
A parade that can barely afford what looks like two balloons and only a few copyrighted characters

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:12.080
can afford a fully-functional rocket pack that even NASA couldn't perfect yet?

00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:14.720
Is there a name for all that's wrong with these writers?!

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:16.600
So he's flying through the city and...

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:18.540
uh... uh...

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:20.420
I... uh...

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:22.160
[Stammering]
Okay. Alright.

00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:24.060
Ladies and gentlemen...

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.080
the film just gave up.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:31.960
It clearly doesn't care about the story narrative or making any semblance of logical sense, so they just said...

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:36.340
"Fuck it", and started showing amusing images that will hopefully entertain your kids.

00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:38.360
Well, you know what they say:

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.480
"If you can't beat 'em, join 'em."

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.080
[Nonsensical music starts]

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:05.220
Uh oh! It looks like Jamie is slipping!

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:07.660
{Turbo Man! HELP!}

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:08.700
{JAMIE!!!}

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:12.380
[As Arnold Schwarzenegger]
"Jamie! No! I will have no one to eat for later!"

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:13.400
[Snarling]

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:16.440
So, of course, Arnold rescues the boy and saves the day.

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:19.800
{Thanks, Turbo Man. I knew you'd save me.}

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:23.980
[As Jake Lloyd]
"You're much better than that other overbuilt, Austrian guy that I look up to!"

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:27.920
{Oh. Thank you, sir. I don't think you know how much he means to me.}

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.720
{Oh, I think I have an idea.}

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:37.400
{I wish that Dad could have been here, ya know. See me fly and all. But he didn't come.}

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:40.860
{Your daddy's not mad at you.}
{How do you know all that?}

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:43.580
[As Jake Lloyd]
"Yes! Do tell, strange, musclebound, big-teethed,

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:47.580
"square-jawed, Austrian-accented He Man who isn't in any way my father!"

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:51.340
{Well, who would know better than... me.}

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:54.140
{Dad?!}
{Howard?!}

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:56.480
[Stammering]
WHAAA-?

00:18:56.480 --> 00:19:00.560
I haven't been this shocked since I found out the secret to living a long-lasting life...

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:01.740
was breathing!

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.300
But wait. What's little Jamie up to?

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:05.800
{Merry Christmas!}

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:10.080
{Wow... This is gonna make my son really happy.}

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:12.420
[As Sinbad]
"As soon as I'm done serving five to twenty."

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:13.080
[Chuckles]

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:16.080
{I'm sorry about that, uh, little tension we had on the roof up there.}

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.200
{Hey, it's cool.}

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:19.560
[As Jake Lloyd]
"I don't care that you tried to savagely kill me

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:23.540
"just to get your hands on a children's possession to satisfy your own sense of self worth."

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:26.380
"For me, that's what Christmas is all about!"

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:30.860
{But, Jaime... I thought you wanted this doll more than anything.}

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:34.940
{What do I need the doll for? I got the REAL Turbo Man at home!}

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:40.040
[As Jake Lloyd]
"A Turbo Man who neglects me and puts his work before anything else!"

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:45.320
{That's my dad! That's my dad!}

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:48.560
[As Arnold Schwarzenegger]
"So long, Jaime. I'm off to neglect you some more."

00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:53.140
Wow... I can safely say that we've all learned absolutely nothing.

00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:57.580
Well, maybe one thing: "JINGLE ALL THE WAY" CAN JINGLE ALL THE WAY TO HELL!

00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:01.000
THIS IS THE WORST CHRISTMAS GIFT SINCE DONALD TRUMP'S TOUPEE!

00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:05.860
It goes against everything that Christmas is about, gets soaked up in a festering ball of commercialism,

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:10.140
and actually has the balls to somehow get Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sinbad in there!

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:15.300
So, Santa, for giving me such a good gift this year, I have just one thing to say to you:

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:18.820
You better watch out. You better not cry.
