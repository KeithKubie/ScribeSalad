00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
&gt;&gt; I think the most exciting innovation, which
I hope will happen

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.900
during the next decade will be that through
the information technology,

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:17.189
there will be a way to listen to people, make
democracy real with the

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:20.449
people not with their representatives of the
people or the parties.

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:27.949
Which to me, will mean improving the state
of the world by listening to

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:35.340
the victims, listening to the people who are
being effected by the weak

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.559
governments, making a democracy something
which really belongs to

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:42.739
people and not to governments only.
