CLIFF REDEKER: So today, we're
extremely thrilled to bring

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:06.860
Brian Klapper here to Google.

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.500
He is the founding partner
of the Klapper Institute.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.040
He's the author of the book
that we're listening in on

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.420
today, "The Q-Loop: The Art
and Science of Lasting

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.620
Corporate Change".

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.210
And over lunch I had a really
great conversation with him,

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.640
and one of the things that we
picked up upon is that change

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.470
is something that all
organizations face as they

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.680
increase in years and
increase in size.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.150
And really, adaptation to change
is important, but what

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.410
is even more important is just
providing a framework for

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.070
these ideas to be expressed
instead of repressed.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.470
And so, as companies grow, it's
very critical that they

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.940
stay nimble, and so "The Q-Loop"
outlines ways that

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.280
companies in all industries can
adapt to that strategy.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.510
So we will have some time for
some Q&amp;A in the end, but in

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.240
the meantime, please join me in
welcoming Brian to Google.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.560
So thank you very much.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.050
BRIAN KLAPPER: Thank you.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.600
It's an honor to be here.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.010
I thought I'd start with a
personal story to kind let you

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.120
know how I got into this
business of change, something

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.560
that Cliff and I were talking
about over lunch.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.020
And for me, it started--

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.620
I was a partner in one of the
big strategy firms for many

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.490
years, and we were given the
honor of working for a major

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.470
money center bank, directly
for the CEO.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.760
And we spent a year working for
this guy, and he asked us,

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.720
he said, I'll give you a blank
check, but what I want you to

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.940
do is develop a strategy for
me that'll help me reinvent

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.120
banking for the 21st century.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.170
As a strategy guy, it just
doesn't get better than that.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.920
That's as good as it gets.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.300
It's a white sheet of paper,
it's a blank check.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.060
It was fabulous.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.910
Spent a year working
for the bank.

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.990
We had teams and teams of
analysts producing hundreds

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.900
and hundreds and hundreds of
models on economic and

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.610
financial analysis, and
by the end, we finally

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.700
presented to him.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.690
Picture a very large conference
room, polished

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.820
mahogany, it was magnificent.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.770
The partners were in the room,
presented to the CEO, and at

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.310
the end of the presentation,
he smiled and he said, I'd

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.560
like to congratulate you folks
on maybe the most brilliant,

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.210
insightful piece of strategy
I've ever seen.

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.525
I said, oh, thank you,
that's great.

00:02:15.525 --> 00:02:18.490
He takes the deck, throws it
against the conference room

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.070
wall, the binder clip opens up,
all of the pages scatter

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.140
around, and he tells us, I don't
think it's worth the

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.920
paper it's printed on,
nevertheless the tens of

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.490
millions of dollars I spent
with your firm.

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.490
So we said, OK, A, can you go
back to the point of how

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.380
brilliant we were, because that
was a much more enjoyable

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.910
conversation.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.160
But I guess, B, why not?

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.660
And he said, you know what?

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.480
I think I understand 85% of
what's in here, and I think

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.680
I'm a pretty clever guy.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.980
I have 160,000 people
that work for me.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.920
What am I supposed
to do with this?

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.480
What do I tell them to
do with this work?

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.030
And so one of my partners
volunteered and said, well, if

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.570
you look at chapter 47 of the
deck, you'll see that there

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.670
are Gantt charts, and pert
charts, and roles,

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.030
responsibilities, guidepost
jobs, accountability.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.235
We have all of that.

00:03:09.235 --> 00:03:11.470
He said, that's not what
I'm talking about.

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.650
What do I do with this?

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.490
How do I get 160,000 people
to basically sing

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.090
off the same hymnal?

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.820
I don't get it.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.090
So I flew back home,
pretty dejected.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.410
Inconsolable, actually, for
the entire weekend.

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.130
And then my wife said to
me, you know what?

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.650
I think he probably gave you
the kindest gift that any

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.540
client has ever given you.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:38.950
I said, what are you
talking about?

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.380
This was a disaster.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.650
I said, OK, what gift?

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.780
He was honest.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.180
I wonder how many of your other
clients felt the same

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.300
way that he did.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.520
You did some highfalutin
strategy work, but at the end

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.670
of the day, they couldn't
implement.

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:54.850
I said, you don't know what
you're talking about.

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.777
My clients love me, repeat
business, long term-- she

00:03:57.777 --> 00:04:00.650
goes, OK, I'm sure
you're right, OK.

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.430
But I was thinking about it, and
I actually decided to then

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.640
go ahead and audit my former
clients to find out what

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.720
percent actually got that full
value of the work that we had

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.610
created for them.

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:16.320
And lo and behold,
it was like 16%.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.010
So I quit two days later.

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.470
I said, I can't do
this anymore.

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.070
So I decided I wanted to get out
of the ideas business, and

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.830
actually get in the trenches
with clients and help clients

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.170
really implement change.

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:30.110
Because that's something that,
quite frankly, companies large

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.760
and small, young and old, always
have a difficult time

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.200
doing, is really driving
change through their

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.250
organization.

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.620
And there are many, many
reasons for that.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.230
And that's what I wanted to
spend most of our time talking

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.320
about today, are what are some
of the reasons why change is

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.420
so difficult for different
companies?

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:49.020
And why there's so much talk and
so many great ideas, but

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.120
organizations don't always
receive the full benefit of

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.370
all those ideas.

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:02.150
So, as an example, suppose you
know of two artists, one of

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:07.350
whom has brilliant ideas and
always takes those ideas and

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.150
puts them down on paper and
translates them into

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.950
beautiful, beautiful
pieces of work.

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:16.720
The other artist has equally
brilliant ideas, but they

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.230
never make it down
to the canvas.

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.770
I think we could all agree that
the first artist is, in

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.110
fact, a brilliant artist.

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.760
But what of the second?

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.540
I guess I would argue the second
artist isn't really an

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:31.065
artist at all.

00:05:31.065 --> 00:05:34.590
He's a talker, and there's a
very big difference between

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.040
being a talker and
being an artist.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.320
And what I've seen when I visit
so many companies is

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.850
companies love to
reward the idea.

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:49.060
And they mistake brilliant ideas
for constructive action,

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:50.050
and that becomes a problem.

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.530
And people often get promoted
not on their ability to

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.280
actually drive change through
an organization, but more on

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.910
their ability to
generate ideas.

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:00.060
And so why is that, and
what's the difference?

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.990
Well, ideation is fun, right?

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:05.045
Especially at a company
like this.

00:06:05.045 --> 00:06:07.320
Who doesn't love kicking
around ideas?

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:11.250
It's a great time, it's fun.

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:14.840
The challenge, though, is
implementation is hard.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.390
It involves changing people.

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:18.060
It Involves influence.

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:21.380
It involves changing
org structures.

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.670
It's very different having an
idea and getting an idea fully

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:24.830
implemented.

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.980
And one of the reasons,
quite frankly,

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:28.880
is the fear of failure.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.880
There's not a lot of failure
at the ideation level.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:34.910
Failure comes at the lack
of implementation level.

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:36.990
I recently heard of this really
interesting story.

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:38.200
Well, I liked it anyway.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:42.120
And it was of a six-year-old
girl.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.100
And the six-year-old girl never
really paid a lot of

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.680
attention in her core subjects,
but she was sitting

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.960
in the back of the room,
diligently focused on some

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.000
drawing that she was making.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.700
So much so that the teacher
said, I really want to

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:59.280
investigate what this girl's
doing, because I've never seen

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.920
her focus quite this
way before.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.890
So she goes back, and she talks
to this little girl, and

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:07.250
she says, excuse me, what
are you working on?

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:10.380
And the little girl looks up
in disgust and says, I'm

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:14.540
drawing a picture of God, and
goes back down to her work.

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:17.860
To which the teacher replies,
but we don't know what God

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:19.570
looks like.

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:21.930
And the little girl looks up
and says, you will in a

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:26.900
minute, and goes back
down to work.

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:30.290
On a more personal note, my wife
and I were going through

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:32.950
our DVD collection, and we
decided for Mother's Day this

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:36.730
past year, we wanted to give our
mothers a compilation DVD

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:39.660
of our kids growing up
through the years.

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:42.910
And we came across one of my
youngest daughter, Danielle,

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:46.390
she's now 13, she was
in kindergarten.

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:50.050
And the teacher asks the entire
kindergarten class, who

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:53.810
knows how to make a Thanksgiving
dinner?

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:56.090
Out of nowhere, my daughter's
hand shoots up, and I look

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:57.600
around, she's the only one
in the class with her

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.960
hand up in the air.

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.220
Not always right, but always
certain, my Danielle.

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:05.720
And so she raises her hand,
teacher calls on her, and

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.770
without prompting she stands up,
because she needed to be

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:10.560
an orator for this answer.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.770
And she stands up, and
she says, I know how

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:14.210
my parents do it.

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:16.750
First, they get a bunch of
turkeys, then they get up a

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:18.390
bunch of pilgrims.

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:20.920
They stuff both the turkeys and
pilgrims with stuffing so

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:25.210
they're fat, and then our
family eats them all.

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:27.720
Not quite the way things work in
our family in Connecticut,

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.250
but nonetheless.

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:31.390
So, what do the two stories
have in common?

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:33.789
Between the little girl drawing
the picture of God,

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:35.240
and my daughter Danielle

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:36.490
convinced that we're cannibals?

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:41.760
They don't feel failure.

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:44.070
Kids never feel failure.

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:45.720
They only see the upside.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.840
They never consider the
downside, and that's probably

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:51.330
something, as we get older, we
recognize that decisions and

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:54.680
ideas have consequences.

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:57.620
But not to the kids.

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:02.130
What I see so often in so many
companies is so many companies

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:05.690
try and stigmatize failure.

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:08.460
I'm working with a client now
who says, we've always been a

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:10.140
company that likes to
take three shots

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:11.850
and score three goals.

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:14.420
I want to be a company that
takes seven shots takes, 10

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:16.810
shots, and scores seven times.

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:19.420
And that's a great ambition,
unless you're one of those

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:23.030
three people that
shot and missed.

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:26.250
So the question is, how can
you-- because if you're not

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:30.210
willing to fail, you'll never
come up with something new.

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:32.580
You'll never come up with
something innovative.

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:34.500
So how do you build an
organization, how do you build

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:36.360
a process, that allows
for failure--

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:38.520
I would argue that even
encourages failure, pursues

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:43.140
failure in a way that promotes
creativity, promotes ideation,

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:46.290
and, ultimately, promotes
implementation?

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:50.650
Now, failure is part
of change.

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:55.040
And when you do the research,
you'll realize that over 70%

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.980
of all company-wide change
efforts fail to deliver their

00:09:57.980 --> 00:09:59.320
intended results.

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:02.510
And that's something small--
like we want to improve our

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:04.100
time to market for
new products--

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:05.200
or something large--

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.790
we want to transform our
entire organization.

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:10.830
70% of all efforts fails.

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:14.650
And when I talk to C-suite
executives, what they tell me

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:17.680
is, we have fabulous people.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.630
Our corporate culture
is terrific.

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:23.370
Our technology is fine, if
not better than fine.

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.770
Yet why is it so hard
for me to get

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:31.110
anything done around here?

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:34.450
I've got 10,000, 20,000, 50,000
people, all presumably

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:35.850
going in different directions.

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:38.820
I can't get them galvanized
around some of the major

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:41.530
issues that I'm looking for
in my organization.

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:42.645
Why is that?

00:10:42.645 --> 00:10:46.160
And when you dissect it, the
roadmap for change is actually

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.180
relatively straightforward.

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:53.720
You create a vision, a strategy,
communication plan,

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:56.980
and then ignite people
to execute.

00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:59.700
Well, the vision--

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:01.970
executives don't get promoted to
executive positions without

00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:03.210
being visionary.

00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:08.040
So most executives have
that box checked.

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:10.400
Strategy-- there's been tons
written about strategy, firms

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:11.840
built around strategy.

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.800
Also something not terribly
difficult,

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.300
once you have a vision.

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:17.490
Communication plans, there are
dozens from which to choose.

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:19.160
You can go on the internet and
find a million of them.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:20.750
Again, not terribly
challenging.

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:22.360
The question is the last one.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.160
And this is where they
all breakdown.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.520
85% of the 70% break down in
the inability to ignite an

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:31.390
organization around a
theme around change.

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:32.640
And that's the challenging
part.

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:39.890
Yet, if you don't change, and
even as a company, if you are

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:42.950
not able to change and make
change an ongoing part of your

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:45.700
core capability, you're going
to have an issue.

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:51.370
Interesting statistic--

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:57.020
back in 1917, only one of the
Forbes greatest companies

00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:58.640
performed better
than average--

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.692
average, in this case,
being the S&amp;P 500.

00:12:01.692 --> 00:12:04.430
And 85 of those 100 are dead.

00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:07.040
They are no longer
in business.

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:08.625
I find that both frightening
and sobering.

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:16.140
Especially because, what does
it take to become one of the

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:18.610
Forbes top 100 companies?

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:20.680
You folks would know.

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:25.520
Great products, great people,
great ideas, great market

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:29.400
position, in some cases,
great location.

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:34.060
So you've got everything going
for you, yet 85% are no longer

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:35.310
in business.

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:43.500
As Michael Collins has said,
it's not because of what the

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:46.260
world does to these companies.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.110
It's what the companies
do to themselves that

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:51.190
causes them to fail.

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:53.140
When you peel back the numbers,
some interesting

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:55.270
themes emerge.

00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:57.610
Three primary ones
as to why these

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:58.700
companies are out of business.

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:03.440
Number one, adherence to a
business model that's no

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:04.690
longer relevant.

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:10.310
So, the marketplace changed, the
business model didn't, and

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:12.290
the company went out.

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:13.540
Blockbuster.

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:23.590
Secondly, the company took its
eye off the customer ball.

00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:25.230
So how do you make
money, right?

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:26.210
You meet the needs--

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:29.720
both the implicit and
explicit needs--

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:32.130
of customers, both what they
want now, and even what they

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:32.920
don't know what they want it.

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:35.000
And the extent you can
anticipate what customers

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.170
want, that will be a successful
business model.

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:41.330
Companies took their eye off
that particular ball.

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:43.280
Consumer tastes change,
companies

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:44.680
didn't, they went out.

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:51.230
In that same bucket, it's
companies that tend to design

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:55.370
products more for themselves
than for customers fall risk

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:58.030
to that particular model.

00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:01.230
Third, and last, is companies
lost out to more nimble

00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:03.050
competitors.

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:07.340
What was once the new, new thing
stopped becoming the new

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:09.400
thing, and, as a result, they
had a talent drain.

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:10.600
They had a brain drain.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.080
And some of their most creative
people got frustrated

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.030
working in what was once
a very entrepreneurial

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:18.470
organization, and they left to
either start their own firms

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:21.620
or to work in companies that
represented the ideal which

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:25.010
was the company that they
thought they joined.

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:27.420
So those are the three primary
reasons why you see

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:29.550
organizations change.

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:31.480
Gary Hamel, in his book "Leading
the Revolution", had

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:32.070
a great quote.

00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:34.960
This is going back probably 15
years, even before Amazon

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:39.280
became relevant, and it was
commenting on Walmart.

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:42.460
And he said, how many people
think the retailing revolution

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:44.810
will start with Walmart?

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:48.290
Who amongst us wants to spend
our time walking around the

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:50.510
soulless canyons of
Walmart looking to

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:53.190
save $10 on a hammer?

00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:55.140
And he hit it right, because if
you think about where did

00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:57.400
we buy hammers when
we were kids?

00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:59.220
Probably the local
hardware store.

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:00.680
And then where?

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:02.200
The big box retailer.

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.570
And then Kmart, and then
Walmart, and then Amazon.

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:05.700
Where's it going to go?

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:06.650
Who knows.

00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:08.930
3D printers, maybe, who knows
where it's going to go?

00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:11.870
But it's not going to
stop with Walmart.

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:14.390
Let me ask you a question.

00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:20.060
Does anybody know, back in the
1960s, early '70s, what the

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:21.910
largest restaurant chain in
the United States was?

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:28.290
Not McDonald's, young man.

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:32.360
Howard Johnson's.

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:34.650
Anyone ever hear of them?

00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:37.820
Red roof, orange sherbet,
popularized in Mad Men?

00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:42.630
Howard Johnson had over 1,000
restaurants around the United

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:46.190
States on the most popular
highways, they had the best

00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:48.420
location of any of them.

00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:51.310
They were the number two food
producer after the US Army,

00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:53.630
and their market share was
larger than McDonald's, Burger

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:56.500
King, and KFC combined.

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.860
And what was their
business model?

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:03.530
Bring your kids in, have a nice,
comfortable meal, relax,

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:06.300
take your time, and we'll
serve you good food at a

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:08.630
reasonably good price,
in a very

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:12.020
relaxing, enjoyable setting.

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:14.950
Now, imagine that you've got a
larger share than McDonald's,

00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:18.020
Burger King, and KFC combined.

00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:20.860
You've got the best location,
you've got fabulous products,

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:22.710
and your customers love you.

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:24.290
So imagine you're up at the
board of directors.

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:25.870
You're sitting at a board of
directors meeting for Howard

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:29.640
Johnson's, and an analyst comes
in who's responsible for

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:34.400
competitive research and says,
folks, I think I've seen the

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:37.940
future, and this is our
biggest competitor.

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:41.220
It should strike fear
in your hearts.

00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:44.300
That's our competitor.

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:47.480
What's your reaction?

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:48.910
You've got to be kidding me.

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:50.880
The clown?

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:54.490
I'm going to get taken
out by the clown?

00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:56.390
And you obviously know
how the story went.

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:57.490
So what happened?

00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:00.050
Why did the clown win?

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:02.380
Women were getting into
the workforce,

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:05.619
time became a commodity.

00:17:05.619 --> 00:17:07.829
People didn't have the time,
nor the patience, nor the

00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:11.490
interest to spend with their
families eating long family

00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:12.829
comfort meals.

00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:14.849
They wanted quick, they wanted
cheap, they want to

00:17:14.849 --> 00:17:17.060
get in and get out.

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:18.819
And there was no place better
positioned than Howard

00:17:18.819 --> 00:17:20.599
Johnson's to take advantage
of that.

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:24.470
Yet the clown won.

00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:30.060
So, I wrote this book, "The
Q-Loop", and the Q-loop was

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:34.450
designed to really offer a
process of ideation through

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:35.760
implementation.

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:38.460
And people say to me, why a Q?

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:40.270
What's with that?

00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:43.140
And it's the flow of ideas, or
what should be the flow of

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:45.060
ideas but isn't always.

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:46.330
So at the top of the Q--

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:48.500
I like to think of the top
of the Q as the top of an

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:49.590
organization.

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:50.840
The senior management.

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:55.290
There's nobody more visionary,
there's no one that should be

00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:56.830
looking out over the
horizon, more

00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:58.110
than your senior managers.

00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:00.910
And they do, for
the most part.

00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:04.010
Ideally, in the Q-loop, though,
they would then start

00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:06.390
organizations on what I
call an idea quest.

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:09.840
Come up with a focus mission,
and then bring that idea

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:12.540
quest, that vision down to the
bottom of the organization.

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:14.940
Down to your front line people,
your first and second

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:16.560
level supervisors.

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:19.180
That's where that could be
wellspring of ideas for the

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:21.840
organization, and is
almost never used.

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:24.350
Then back up to the top of the
organization for resourcing

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:26.580
and staffing, and then back
down one more time for

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:30.020
piloting and then out the
Q for implementation and

00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:32.000
firm-wide rollout.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.210
One of the questions I ask when
I'm in these kinds of

00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:39.430
meetings is, I talk about a
concept that I'm quite fond

00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:41.080
of, and it's called
organizational

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:43.620
IQ, collective IQ.

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:46.050
And the notion there is, let's
say you've got an organization

00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:52.010
of 10,000 people with an
average IQ of 120.

00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:57.880
That's 1.2 million IQ points
available to the organization.

00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:59.940
And when I asked senior
executives what percent of

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:04.000
that 1.2 million IQ points do
you take advantage of in your

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.380
decision making, your ideation,
your input into

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:09.430
strategic planning, for the most
important decisions you

00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:13.540
companies makes,
what do I get?

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:16.500
1 to 5%.

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:19.620
Ideas, visions come from the top
of the organization, and

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:22.360
they stay in that very top of
the Q, and they never make it

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:24.400
down to the lower ends
of the organization.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:26.010
And why does it matter?

00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:28.960
Well, because the folks that
are on your front lines are

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:31.030
the ones closest to
your customers.

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:33.280
They're the ones that witness
millions and millions and

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:36.125
millions of customer
interactions, and do you know

00:19:36.125 --> 00:19:37.700
what they do with them?

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:39.710
Typically, absolutely nothing.

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:42.550
They keep them to themselves.

00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:45.840
They are busy typically
protecting an organization

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:47.880
from the customers.

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:50.320
Nobody wants to see how the
souffle is made, and that's

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:51.730
what your front line
workers do.

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:54.770
I call them heroes, because they
are the ones that prevent

00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:57.130
your customer from really
peering inside to how things

00:19:57.130 --> 00:19:58.890
really work in most
organizations.

00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:02.700
And it's a vast treasure trove
of information that is almost

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:07.780
never taken advantage of, and
I think that's a big shame.

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:10.220
In addition, you're asking
these people to

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:12.540
implement your ideas.

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:13.980
How many people love
to implement

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:15.520
someone else's ideas?

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:18.590
Show of hands.

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:22.380
Few people like to implement
other people's ideas.

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:24.940
But people fall over themselves
to implement the

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:27.070
ideas that they had a
hand in creating.

00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:27.620
Why wouldn't they?

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:30.500
And especially if your front
line, first level supervisors,

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:32.870
these are the people where
the pragmatism exists.

00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:35.300
They're not in the ivory tower
up on the top floor of an

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:37.640
office building, these are the
people in the trenches.

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:40.330
They're going to war every day
on behalf of the company.

00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:43.280
So there's huge pragmatism that
exists on the front line,

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:45.200
and all of the ideas that would
come from these people

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.380
typically are very pragmatic in

00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:48.690
nature and easy to implement.

00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:51.910
So, if you follow the Q-Loop
concept, it's vision up front,

00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:54.450
ideas come from the front line,
up to the front again

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:58.150
for resourcing, for span of
control, for prioritization,

00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:02.130
back down for testing, and then
out for implementation.

00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:04.070
And yes, testing is extremely
important.

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:07.860
Ask JCPenney what happens when
you implement great ideas that

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:09.730
aren't previously tested.

00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:13.950
So, rapid cycle innovation is a
fabulous tool, not just for

00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:17.550
IT products, but for processes,
for org structures,

00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:20.090
for incentive structures.

00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:22.330
It works brilliantly.

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:24.240
Before you can implement
something like Q-Loop, though,

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:27.820
it's helpful to understand how
you currently solve problems

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:30.320
in your current organization,
or how you realize

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:32.330
opportunities.

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:34.970
So, I built this matrix.

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:40.120
On the x-axis is understanding
the degree to which you

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:43.980
believe your solution will
contribute to solving an

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:48.270
issue, or realizing
an opportunity.

00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:51.930
On the y-axis is to what extent
you as an organization

00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:55.760
deeply understand why that
issue has occurred.

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:58.290
Why the problem has occurred, or
why that opportunity might

00:21:58.290 --> 00:21:59.910
present itself.

00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:04.350
70% of all organizations
are in this first box.

00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:06.050
We don't understand why the
problem occurred in the first

00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:08.980
place, and we really have no
idea how our solution is going

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:10.910
to solve the problem.

00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:12.390
And we call that firefighting.

00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:14.330
And that's just gathering a
bunch of people a room,

00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:16.640
throwing them against a task,
and eventually, if they are

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:19.240
the right people, you're going
to find that they're going to

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:20.780
come up with a solution.

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:22.830
Now, will they understand
the causality?

00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:24.060
Probably not.

00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:26.310
Will the solution stick
and be robust?

00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:27.110
Doubtful.

00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:29.300
But it will have them solve
the problem in relatively

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:31.030
short order.

00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:33.550
And some organizations
thrive on it.

00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:35.470
They love the chaos.

00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:37.930
It's just not sustainable and
not good business practice.

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:40.620
It's certainly not efficient.

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:41.940
If we go along the x-axis--

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:45.600
so I really understand how my
solution will solve the

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:47.950
problem, but I don't have the
faintest idea of what the

00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:50.850
problem occurred, nor what
the great idea could be.

00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:53.060
We call that tribal wisdom.

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:53.740
So what is that?

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:56.150
That means there's a great
opportunity for us here, we

00:22:56.150 --> 00:22:59.070
want to enter a new market,
we call George.

00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:00.860
George is the new
market expert.

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:03.840
George comes riding in on this
big white horse, dismounts,

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:06.670
and says, OK, folks, minions,
tell me the problem.

00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:09.010
I, George, will solve it for
you with the aid of my big

00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:11.320
white horse.

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:12.680
And George solves the problem.

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:13.360
Why?

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:16.566
Because he's George, and he's
got a big white horse.

00:23:16.566 --> 00:23:20.610
And that's a fine way to solve
problems provided George never

00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:22.950
goes on maternity leave,
provided George never leaves

00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:25.880
the company, provided the
problem is always within

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:28.200
George's wheel house.

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:32.060
So it's a very risky way to
solve problems when you rely

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:34.202
solely on experts.

00:23:34.202 --> 00:23:36.090
Young, emerging companies
typically solve

00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:37.220
problems this way.

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:39.980
Tons of pockets of expertise,
bring in George and the horse,

00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:42.620
they solve the problems, George
goes back, organization

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:43.870
feels, well, that's gone.

00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:45.140
Until the next problem.

00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:47.470
But by not codifying this, by
not building part of your

00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:48.730
institutional knowledge, you're

00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:50.690
always relying on George.

00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:53.360
The problem with implementing
a more robust approach to

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:55.460
ideation through change is
you're going to have

00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:57.210
resistance, as we
talked about.

00:23:57.210 --> 00:23:59.740
Who do you think the biggest
resistor will be?

00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:00.930
George.

00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:01.880
Why?

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:05.050
Because the day that all boats
rise is the day you take away

00:24:05.050 --> 00:24:06.300
George's horse.

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:10.400
And who is George without
his horse?

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:12.420
He's a little guy that
just solves problems.

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:14.400
So he's going to resist
tooth and nail.

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:17.710
So how do you solve that?

00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:19.580
You include George in ideation,
because if you

00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:20.970
don't, he's going to resist.

00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:22.780
And we don't want him to leave,
because he has talents

00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:25.990
that none of us have.

00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:28.430
If we go, we say on our current
level on the x, we go

00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:32.790
up the y-axis to where you have
no idea how our solution

00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:34.940
is going to solve the problem.

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:37.220
But we love generating
potential ideas.

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:40.260
We do, however, have a pretty
good insight as to what the

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:44.110
marketplace wants, or why the
problem is occurring.

00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:45.610
We call this the conference
room solution--

00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:47.360
I call this conference
room solution.

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:50.270
It's my least favorite
of the four boxes.

00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:53.370
And this is where, typically,
senior management will come

00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:54.710
down from the mountain.

00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:59.740
They'll say, I've got an idea,
execute it, my minions.

00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:01.335
And if you think of the gears--
think of big gears

00:25:01.335 --> 00:25:02.350
that intersect--

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:05.350
large gear, small gear, smaller
gear, tiny gear.

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:07.570
Big gear representing
senior management.

00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:09.770
Big gear moves one quarter
turn, what

00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:11.970
happens to small gear?

00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:13.500
Yeah, it spins around like
a top, and finally

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:15.790
flies off the flywheel.

00:25:15.790 --> 00:25:18.840
Because what's so simple to
senior management, as we all

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:21.100
know, who are not senior
management, not always quite

00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:23.765
so simple making that one little
change to a program.

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:29.910
Typically, many, many, many
organizations are run via

00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:31.520
conference room solution.

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:34.300
And I'll talk about that a
little bit more in a minute.

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:36.810
And then lastly, fact based
analysis, which is collecting

00:25:36.810 --> 00:25:39.070
data, collecting reams and
reams of customer data,

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:42.310
processing through a thoughtful
fact-based

00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:45.230
approach, and bringing it back
down for implementation.

00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:47.920
And that's typically the
smallest box, in terms of how

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:49.170
most companies solve problems.

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:54.630
I think this is the enemy to a
lot of the work that we're

00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:55.640
talking about.

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:57.260
Because this is the
de facto way that

00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:58.870
people solve problems.

00:25:58.870 --> 00:26:01.050
I live in Connecticut, so I was
on the plane ride over,

00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:04.120
and I was reading an article in
the Times, and it was about

00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:07.540
a new approach to solving
a crisis in the

00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:08.950
New York area hospitals.

00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:10.270
So three or four hospitals--

00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:13.370
the big ones, Cornell, Columbia,
Beth Israel--

00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:16.270
they form the consortium, and
they did some really great

00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:18.430
customer customer research.

00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:19.170
All made sense.

00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:20.995
And so they talked to their
patients and said, what did

00:26:20.995 --> 00:26:21.850
you like about your stay?

00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:22.830
What didn't you like?

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:24.140
What can we do better?

00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:27.250
How can we do a better
job of servicing you?

00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:29.980
And one of the major issues from
the patient perspective

00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:33.100
is I can't distinguish the
nurses from all of the other

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:35.690
health care workers.

00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:37.920
Logical and make sense.

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:39.550
Hundreds and hundreds of people
running around, I can't

00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:40.660
distinguish them.

00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:42.630
So they convened a meeting
of the minds, the senior

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:43.980
executives, they said,
how are we going

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:45.830
to solve this problem?

00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:47.700
And they came up with
a solution.

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:52.050
Let's immediately order all
nurses to wear white.

00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:54.560
A little 1950s for my taste, but
nonetheless, let's order

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:56.450
all nurses to wear white.

00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:57.620
And they went ahead and
procured like a

00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:00.570
million nurse uniforms.

00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:02.280
How well do you think that was
received on the part of the

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:03.530
nursing community?

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:08.180
Not great.

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:10.140
But it seems so logical.

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:13.600
Nurses, white, pure,
clean, sanitized,

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:15.650
health care, hospitals.

00:27:15.650 --> 00:27:17.750
Why didn't the nurses like it?

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:19.000
Any ideas?

00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:24.120
It wasn't their idea.

00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:25.960
And what were their ideas?

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:27.530
Well, they had some
real concerns.

00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:29.490
Number one is, white
looks great at the

00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:31.190
beginning of the day.

00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:33.270
But I'm dealing with bodily
fluids, ladies and gentleman.

00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:35.580
By the end of the day, it
doesn't look white.

00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:37.980
So it's a disaster
to maintain.

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:42.230
Number two, white, when washed,
tends to get sheer.

00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:45.650
Good news for the patients,
bad news for the nurses.

00:27:45.650 --> 00:27:48.790
And this third thing, and maybe
most importantly is they

00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:50.630
lost their identity.

00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:53.680
Nurses really enjoyed being
able to pick out their own

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:56.230
uniforms, their own scrubs.

00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:59.640
And so they took away their
entire sense of identity.

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:02.940
So what seemed like such a great
idea in the board room,

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:04.440
when you try to implement
it, it was

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:06.890
an unmitigated disaster.

00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:11.020
And that was so easily solvable
by simply inviting

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:14.750
the actual users of the product,
of the idea into your

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:15.720
ideation process.

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:16.970
Yet that was never considered.

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:21.720
The other reason I don't like
the conference room is because

00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:23.550
it exists so far away
from the customers.

00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:24.845
Howard Schultz--

00:28:24.845 --> 00:28:27.450
founder and CEO, as you
know, of Starbucks--

00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:29.830
visits 25 stores a month.

00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:33.220
25 stores a week, excuse
me, 25 stores a week.

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:36.710
And when asked, why do you do
that, he said, my business is

00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:38.380
incredibly simple--

00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:40.880
and I would argue, actually, all
businesses are incredibly

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:43.100
simple, if you let them be.

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:45.330
My business is a simple.

00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:51.810
What I do, simply, is I pour
coffee, I serve coffee to one

00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:54.260
customer at a time.

00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:55.720
That's my business.

00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:59.330
And unless I can go out there
and taste it and smell and

00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:02.320
watch it and observe it, I'm
going to lose track of what

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:03.640
really matters to my company.

00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:11.440
So it's vital that you really
get out there and understand

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:13.130
what your customers are
really looking for.

00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:18.700
What I want to do now is talk a
little bit about how you can

00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:22.580
use some of those techniques and
get in with your customers

00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:25.230
to maybe shake your idea tree
a little bit, and maybe give

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:29.265
you some new ways to promote
some creativity.

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:33.820
And they're a little
bit nontraditional.

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:40.260
So one of them is what I call
impose artificial constraints,

00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:43.800
or ask what if?

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:48.950
What if you lost all of your B
to B business tomorrow, and

00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:51.300
you had to only focus
on B to C?

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:53.290
How would you survive?

00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:55.590
Conversely, what if you lost all
B to C, and you became a B

00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:57.950
to B business exclusively?

00:29:57.950 --> 00:30:00.860
What if you had to introduce
new product in the next six

00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:05.370
months that would materially
add to revenue?

00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:08.020
What if you lost half of your
employees tomorrow night?

00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:08.990
They're all gone.

00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:10.390
You went from a company
of 50,000

00:30:10.390 --> 00:30:11.900
employees to 25 overnight.

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:13.150
What would you do?

00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:21.620
What if you were unable to gain
a single new customer for

00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:23.400
the next 24 months?

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:25.155
What would you do?

00:30:25.155 --> 00:30:27.655
Now, you may look at me and
say, well that's absurd.

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:32.520
Those constraints
are ridiculous.

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:36.240
And I would argue, maybe, but
what it will do is it'll force

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:40.850
you to squeeze every last ounce
of value out of what

00:30:40.850 --> 00:30:42.660
you're doing today.

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:44.100
Let me give you is
a case study.

00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:47.930
So, working for a very large
brand name financial services

00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:51.220
firm, and they were stunted
with how to grow.

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:55.710
It cost them as much to acquire
new customers as it

00:30:55.710 --> 00:30:57.920
did for the revenue that they
couldn't get out of that

00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:00.710
revenue box, much
as they tried.

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:03.030
So let's try the artificial
constraints.

00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:05.360
And we said, in this case, what
if you weren't going to

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:06.780
get any new customers?

00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:09.780
How would you survive?

00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:11.770
And that caused them to think in
ways they'd never thought.

00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:13.720
They've always been thinking
very vertically, they weren't

00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:14.865
thinking laterally.

00:31:14.865 --> 00:31:17.960
So they said, OK, well, if we
were unable to get any new

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:19.930
customers, how do we
maximize the value

00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:22.690
of our current customers?

00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:25.210
So they started thinking about
share of wallet, which wasn't

00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:27.325
really a metric they were
thinking about in the past.

00:31:27.325 --> 00:31:29.810
And they said, OK, we need to
maximize share of wallet.

00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:31.630
How might we do that?

00:31:31.630 --> 00:31:33.550
Well, the way that they were
structured was this company

00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:36.010
sold all their products
through non-dedicated

00:31:36.010 --> 00:31:37.400
financial advisers.

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:39.520
And the entire industry-- and
it's a mature industry, been

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:41.620
around for 50 years--

00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:45.520
every one dedicated all of their
resources to focusing in

00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:47.690
on a financial adviser
relationship.

00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:48.140
Why?

00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:50.850
Because unlike the automotive
dealers, these financial

00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:54.670
advisers were not dedicated
to the company.

00:31:54.670 --> 00:31:56.190
They could sell any product.

00:31:56.190 --> 00:31:57.630
So unless we had a deep
relationship with the

00:31:57.630 --> 00:32:01.050
financial adviser, we were
afraid we would never get any

00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:02.570
new customers.

00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:04.550
So all of our offices were
located by where all the

00:32:04.550 --> 00:32:06.200
financial advisors were.

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:08.100
However, when we did the
artificial constraint of what

00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:10.830
it, what they then realized--
and they did analysis they'd

00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:12.400
never done before--

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:14.880
they realized that the financial
advisors typically

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:16.920
brought them no more than
two deals a year.

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:18.045
That was it.

00:32:18.045 --> 00:32:20.470
And because they were a brand
name, they were brought to

00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:22.978
every major deal that there was
to be had-- this is a B to

00:32:22.978 --> 00:32:25.700
B kind of business, obviously.

00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:27.760
So they were brought to every
possible deal because of who

00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:31.540
they were, yet they closed their
fair share of deals.

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:38.140
And so, the analysis of what
if caused them to say, we

00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:40.720
don't want to close our fair
share of deals, we want to

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:43.020
close our fair share of deals
as well as that of the next

00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:44.450
three competitors.

00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:46.060
We want it all.

00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:46.990
And they should want it all.

00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:48.470
Why not?

00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:52.410
Well, in order to get it all,
the phrase we wound up using

00:32:52.410 --> 00:32:55.870
were there always got invited to
dance, they just never took

00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:57.400
their date home.

00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:00.740
So the question is, how do you
increase the odds of winning

00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:03.450
once you get taken
to the dance?

00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:06.450
And for them, what they realized
was, they had nothing

00:33:06.450 --> 00:33:08.150
interesting to say.

00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:10.140
They won their fair share of
deals because they were the

00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:12.080
same as everybody else.

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:14.450
What if they had something
interesting to say?

00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:16.250
So they decided in a pilot--

00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:17.790
and pilot is something you're
going to hear from me a lot.

00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:19.190
I love the concept the pilots.

00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:21.190
Rapid cycle innovation,
all about piloting.

00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:23.160
And it's not just about
products, it's about services,

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:24.800
and even lines of business.

00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:27.240
What if we pilot a
practice model?

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:30.010
So think consulting firms
or law firms.

00:33:30.010 --> 00:33:33.290
And we would actually build a
practice around machinery,

00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:36.500
health care, high tech,
utilities, what have you.

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:38.930
And let's go to the dance with
something really interesting

00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:41.690
to say, not only about the
potential client, but also

00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:43.920
about the industry trends and
how we can save them and their

00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:46.110
participants money.

00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:47.880
And they launched the pilot.

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:50.920
Within three weeks of launching
the pilot, a billion

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:53.540
dollar asset signed
up with them.

00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:55.540
And they signed up with them
for one reason-- they said,

00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:57.820
finally someone is thinking
and actually shattering

00:33:57.820 --> 00:33:58.850
industry paradigms.

00:33:58.850 --> 00:34:01.330
You finally have something to
say to me, as opposed to being

00:34:01.330 --> 00:34:03.390
a commodity provider.

00:34:03.390 --> 00:34:04.820
We're going to go ahead, and
even though we know you're in

00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:07.060
pilot stage, we're going to
support you by transferring

00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:08.310
all of our business.

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:13.540
They launched in 2012.

00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:17.440
All pilots were fully installed
by the end of 2012,

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:20.840
and this client achieved their
annual revenue targets for

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:25.090
2013 in March of 2013.

00:34:25.090 --> 00:34:27.620
And now other folks in the
industry, other players, are

00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:29.360
starting to migrate to
the practice model.

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:32.080
And it all got there because of
the what if, the artificial

00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:32.500
constraint.

00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:34.420
So it's a good one, I'd
encourage you really think

00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:36.370
about how you could maybe apply
that into some of the

00:34:36.370 --> 00:34:39.480
challenges that you
guys are facing.

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:43.860
Another one like the what if is
alter your point of view.

00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:46.860
You clearly have a point of
view, and you're more often

00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:48.969
right than wrong.

00:34:48.969 --> 00:34:50.889
But altering your point of view
can be a really powerful

00:34:50.889 --> 00:34:53.150
exercise as well.

00:34:53.150 --> 00:34:55.680
Give you another example.

00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:58.510
Oh, and I apologize for using
financial services again, but

00:34:58.510 --> 00:35:00.650
it's a good example.

00:35:00.650 --> 00:35:02.260
This was an insurance company.

00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:05.810
Fortune 100 insurance company,
been around forever, belt and

00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:09.540
suspenders organization,
extremely conservative.

00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:12.580
Head of insurance wanted to
introduce a new product for

00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:16.470
the senior market, and his
challenge to us was, I want

00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:19.420
you to create for us a
game-changing customer

00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:22.030
experience from cradle
to grave.

00:35:22.030 --> 00:35:24.540
From the time the customer
becomes aware of the product,

00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:27.310
until she uses it and
gets it serviced.

00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:31.690
I want innovation, I
want game-changing.

00:35:31.690 --> 00:35:33.580
They've been at this
game-changing concept for this

00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:35.120
product for about nine months
before we started

00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:36.330
working with them.

00:35:36.330 --> 00:35:38.460
And for them, they literally--
true story--

00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:41.750
got as far as changing the color
of the stationary from

00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:45.530
white to ivory in their
welcome letter.

00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:46.780
I wouldn't exactly call
that game-changing.

00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:53.900
It's an interesting example
to me because they only

00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:55.710
knew what they knew.

00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:59.050
And they didn't have the ability
to think beyond their

00:35:59.050 --> 00:36:01.070
current paradigms.

00:36:01.070 --> 00:36:04.155
So it's often helpful to bring
in a very different paradigm

00:36:04.155 --> 00:36:05.860
to shake their tree.

00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:09.610
So example here was
Mini Cooper.

00:36:09.610 --> 00:36:11.760
Early in the year, I bought
my wife a Mini

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:13.620
Cooper for her birthday.

00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:16.650
Now in the category of probably
too much information,

00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:19.650
my wife's a former auditor at JP
Morgan, investment banker.

00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:20.860
So she loves numbers.

00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:24.350
I can't spend more than $10
without her knowing about it.

00:36:24.350 --> 00:36:26.740
So clearly, trying to buy a car
without her knowing about

00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:29.470
it probably wouldn't
pass muster.

00:36:29.470 --> 00:36:31.490
So I went to the dealership and
I said, I want to do this

00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:34.680
for my wife's birthday, it
needs to be a surprise.

00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:38.090
And, quite frankly, I don't have
enough cash to pay for

00:36:38.090 --> 00:36:39.800
this thing, so I need to go
through some sort of credit

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:41.215
card or write you a
check, and here's

00:36:41.215 --> 00:36:42.255
where the problem starts.

00:36:42.255 --> 00:36:43.800
He said, don't worry
about that.

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:45.300
Sit down, relax, have
a cappuccino, and

00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:46.650
let's design your car.

00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:48.570
I said, OK.

00:36:48.570 --> 00:36:51.200
As you may know for Mini, there
are truly a million

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:54.230
different combinations of Mini
Cooper that you can design.

00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:58.150
So we spent about three hours
having fun designing the car.

00:36:58.150 --> 00:36:59.740
I then said, OK, there's still
the elephant in the room,

00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:01.390
which is how do I pay
for this thing?

00:37:01.390 --> 00:37:02.640
He said, here's what I'm
thinking-- do you have an

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:03.650
insurance card with you?

00:37:03.650 --> 00:37:04.440
I said, I do.

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:05.410
He said, may I have it please?

00:37:05.410 --> 00:37:07.080
I said, absolutely.

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:09.350
Gave him the insurance card,
made a copy, came back, said,

00:37:09.350 --> 00:37:10.920
it's all done.

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:11.600
I said, what's all done?

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:13.320
All I gave you was an insurance
card and the specs

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:14.540
for the car.

00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:15.870
He said, well, no,
it's all done.

00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:18.390
You wife's birthday is
two weeks from now.

00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:22.280
Here's my thinking, if this
works for you, Mr. Klapper--

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:24.380
I'm going to have the car driven
over and parked in your

00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:26.720
driveway at 10:00 AM,
if that works.

00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:28.640
It'll have a big red bow, OK?

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:30.810
I said, OK, it sounds good.

00:37:30.810 --> 00:37:32.620
And it's OK with you, what I'd
like you to do is I'm going to

00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:33.880
have the keys there.

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:35.620
Drive around-- it
was a Friday--

00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:38.570
drive around for the weekend,
let your wife have some fun.

00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:40.930
On Monday morning, have her come
in, or you come in, we'll

00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:43.270
settle up all the finances
at that point.

00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:44.170
I said, well, do you
need a deposit?

00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:45.080
He said, not necessary.

00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:45.920
Where are you going to go?

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:46.725
You going to steal a car?

00:37:46.725 --> 00:37:48.280
You don't look like the
car theft kind of guy.

00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:50.030
We'll settle the
finances later.

00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:51.815
Enjoy the car, enjoy the
surprise, and happy birthday

00:37:51.815 --> 00:37:53.730
to your wife.

00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:56.260
Two weeks later, we do
that, big success.

00:37:56.260 --> 00:37:58.000
A box comes in the mail,
beautifully gift wrapped, from

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.370
Mini, to my wife with stickers,
and coupons, and

00:38:01.370 --> 00:38:04.780
mugs, and key chains, and all
kinds of things, Mini Cooper

00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:06.630
membership.

00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:09.760
And several months later, other
boxes came as well to

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:11.690
build the affiliation.

00:38:11.690 --> 00:38:12.380
That's what I would call

00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:14.740
game-changing customer service.

00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:17.610
Why shouldn't every single
interaction be like that?

00:38:17.610 --> 00:38:18.780
It didn't cost them
a lot more.

00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:22.150
In fact, I would argue it cost
them no more than the crappy

00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:25.690
experience we get when we buy
most cars, as I had three

00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:27.330
weeks ago when I bought
my daughter a car.

00:38:27.330 --> 00:38:30.180
Wasn't a Mini, and it was your
typical car experience, which

00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:31.470
was, to put it kindly--

00:38:31.470 --> 00:38:32.720
sub optimal.

00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:37.610
We then use this approach
to insurance.

00:38:37.610 --> 00:38:41.270
And you may say, oh, wait
a minute, insurance?

00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:42.960
And that's what the team said.

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:45.820
We don't have a sexy car like
a Mini Cooper, how do

00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:46.600
we make this work?

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:48.240
And we said, well, let's
talk about it.

00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:50.620
What's the first thing that
happened on the front end?

00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:51.647
And he said, well, you
had the choice, you

00:38:51.647 --> 00:38:52.880
had unlimited choice.

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:55.020
I said, I didn't have unlimited
choice, I had the

00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:56.210
perception of unlimited
choice.

00:38:56.210 --> 00:38:58.130
There's a big difference.

00:38:58.130 --> 00:38:59.510
There were a million
combinations, there we're not

00:38:59.510 --> 00:39:01.066
a million and one.

00:39:01.066 --> 00:39:03.320
Had I wanted a million and
one, I couldn't get it.

00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:05.220
So all of the potential
combinations were

00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:07.270
predetermined and costed out.

00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:09.250
That's a pretty powerful
model.

00:39:09.250 --> 00:39:12.180
Why can't you do that when you
offer your insurance product,

00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:13.370
but give the customer
perception

00:39:13.370 --> 00:39:14.860
of unlimited choice?

00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:16.530
So that's something they
did on the front end.

00:39:16.530 --> 00:39:20.470
So their salesforce went our
with iPads with different

00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:23.870
options and allowed customer to
really interact with their

00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:25.910
agent, which had never
been done before.

00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:27.930
Next thing that arrived was a
welcome letter, hand signed by

00:39:27.930 --> 00:39:30.310
the head of insurance, welcoming
them into this

00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:31.820
insurance family.

00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:34.550
Third thing that came out
was a stock certificate.

00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:37.230
This was a security product
for senior citizens.

00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:39.540
They could harken back to the
days of when you actually

00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:42.210
owned stock in the company.

00:39:42.210 --> 00:39:45.240
Highly-rated insurance company,
as part of the

00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:47.890
product, instead of a Mini
Cooper, they got a physical

00:39:47.890 --> 00:39:50.670
stock certificate that actually
showed tangibility to

00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:53.010
what was heretofore an
intangible product.

00:39:53.010 --> 00:39:55.090
Very powerful.

00:39:55.090 --> 00:39:57.110
They instituted white glove
customer service, concierge

00:39:57.110 --> 00:40:01.820
level service focused
on senior training.

00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:04.260
And then the last thing was, in
the mail, about three weeks

00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:06.730
after taking delivery of the
product, they got a blanket

00:40:06.730 --> 00:40:08.960
with the logo the insurance
company.

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:11.700
A security blanket.

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:12.700
What did that do?

00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:14.220
Well, it gave senior
citizens a warm

00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:15.720
feeling about the company.

00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:17.160
It also was a great
marketing tool.

00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:18.840
So when one senior citizen
talked to the other--

00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:19.850
where did you get
the new blanket?

00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:21.160
I got it from this insurance
company when

00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:22.300
I bought this product--

00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:25.930
it became viral marketing.

00:40:25.930 --> 00:40:29.830
So, taking a non-industry
example to solve a challenge

00:40:29.830 --> 00:40:32.560
that you have is a very powerful
way to shake paradigm

00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:35.200
and get people to
think laterally.

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:39.080
Last example I'll give you on
thinking differently is what I

00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:41.990
call killing the status quo.

00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:43.780
Newco.

00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:46.400
Driving your company
out of business.

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:48.280
I've done this on the corporate
level, I've done it

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:49.800
on the department level,
I've even done it

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:50.990
on the process level.

00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:54.450
So a company would come and say,
we want to go ahead and--

00:40:54.450 --> 00:40:55.780
how long does your product
development

00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:57.130
process take today?

00:40:57.130 --> 00:41:00.610
And they'll say, 18 months.

00:41:00.610 --> 00:41:05.610
I'll say, OK, that's more than
a little bit of time.

00:41:05.610 --> 00:41:07.200
What would game-changing be?

00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:08.750
And they'd say 12 months.

00:41:08.750 --> 00:41:11.280
And said, well, think again,
that's not game-changing.

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:14.450
How about four weeks?

00:41:14.450 --> 00:41:15.860
And they'll say, you don't
understand my business.

00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:17.900
And I say, probably that's
a good thing.

00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:21.320
Why don't we go ahead and design
a newco process without

00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:22.810
any constraints that
you have today.

00:41:22.810 --> 00:41:25.670
Forget structure, forget
technology, forget anything.

00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:26.693
Let's see if we can
get a product to

00:41:26.693 --> 00:41:27.920
market in four weeks.

00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:30.680
Cradle to grave.

00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:34.110
And by applying the principles
of dazzle, beguile, astound,

00:41:34.110 --> 00:41:37.730
and delight, those are always
the founding principles of

00:41:37.730 --> 00:41:40.900
what newco would look like.

00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:44.980
KFC up in Canada had some
issues, more than a few.

00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:48.080
They had 500 stores, stock price
had declined from 13 and

00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:49.920
3/4 down to a little
more than a buck.

00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:51.460
The brand had stopped resonating
with younger

00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:54.310
consumers, traffic was gone.

00:41:54.310 --> 00:41:56.010
No, they didn't go back to
Howard Johnson's, but they

00:41:56.010 --> 00:41:57.880
were going elsewhere.

00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:00.370
And they said to us, we need
a massive operation

00:42:00.370 --> 00:42:01.130
transformation.

00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:06.770
And oh, by the way, our field
turnover is 200%.

00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:08.280
Can you help?

00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:09.700
I said, probably.

00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:14.020
But the last thing I would do is
tackle this as a 400 or 500

00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:16.150
restaurant store
transformation.

00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:17.520
That's going to fail.

00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:19.630
Let's pick a store.

00:42:19.630 --> 00:42:22.610
And let's pick a store and put
a charter in place that's

00:42:22.610 --> 00:42:24.030
about dazzling, beguiling,
astounding, and

00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:25.840
delighting our customers.

00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:29.050
And let's build a store the way
we would want to build a

00:42:29.050 --> 00:42:31.290
store if this were
our company.

00:42:31.290 --> 00:42:32.330
So we formed a team--

00:42:32.330 --> 00:42:33.560
eight people.

00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:37.280
Half time, two constraints--

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:39.790
they had 45 days to get the
store turned around, and they

00:42:39.790 --> 00:42:41.460
had a budget of $20,000.

00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:43.230
That was it.

00:42:43.230 --> 00:42:44.480
No other constraints.

00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:48.750
And over the course of 45 days,
we had representation

00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:52.650
from marketing, from product,
from R&amp;D, from technology,

00:42:52.650 --> 00:42:56.600
from sales, from ops, as
well as store people.

00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:59.940
And 45 days later, we
opened a store.

00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:02.650
300 operational improvements.

00:43:02.650 --> 00:43:04.065
Products that we took from
the test kitchen

00:43:04.065 --> 00:43:05.350
and launched them.

00:43:05.350 --> 00:43:07.100
Specials that they'd
never done before.

00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:10.670
New deals, new promotions,
door-to-door marketing, sub

00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:11.730
zip code marketing.

00:43:11.730 --> 00:43:14.280
Things they've never thought of
before, we put it all into

00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:14.600
this store.

00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:16.960
We called it model store.

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:19.400
And when we launched model
store, model store went from

00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:22.400
what was in the bottom
decile--

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:23.180
no, not bottom, excuse me.

00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:26.560
It was in the third or fourth
lowest decile store to the

00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:29.650
single highest-performing store
out of 450 in the entire

00:43:29.650 --> 00:43:31.080
organization.

00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:35.190
Same store, sales had doubled,
average check had doubled,

00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:37.830
profitability had doubled
against any control you'd ever

00:43:37.830 --> 00:43:39.660
want to measure for
this model store.

00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:42.180
And that became the blueprint
for how you roll it out across

00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:44.220
the entire enterprise.

00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:45.870
A very powerful concept.

00:43:45.870 --> 00:43:47.840
Put yourself out of business,
put your process out of

00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:50.110
business, put your department
out of business, even put your

00:43:50.110 --> 00:43:51.160
company out of business.

00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:54.910
It's a very powerful way
to reinvent yourself.

00:43:54.910 --> 00:43:57.270
And you can do it in a rather
risk-free way, because if this

00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:58.330
store didn't work?

00:43:58.330 --> 00:44:00.720
it was one of 450.

00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:02.540
There was no downside risk.

00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:04.150
I'm doing it with
a company now.

00:44:04.150 --> 00:44:07.490
They've actually completely
decimated the top two floors

00:44:07.490 --> 00:44:09.830
of their office space, and
they're building newco to put

00:44:09.830 --> 00:44:11.250
the entire company
out of business.

00:44:11.250 --> 00:44:12.970
What they believe is their
business model is starting to

00:44:12.970 --> 00:44:16.790
fade, they want to test a new
concept before they start,

00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:19.990
they're bare bones staffing it,
lean budget, rapid time

00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:21.600
frame-- crazy time frame--

00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:24.090
and they're bringing over
customers one at a time, and

00:44:24.090 --> 00:44:26.790
staffing accordingly until they
can ultimately build out

00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:28.190
this new organization.

00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:30.480
It's all about lateral
thinking.

00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:33.590
Lateral thinking is extremely
difficult.

00:44:33.590 --> 00:44:35.000
Vertical thinking is easy.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.810
So if I were to ask you, what
was the name of your

00:44:37.810 --> 00:44:41.440
elementary school, could
you tell me?

00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:41.960
Yeah.

00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:43.315
What was the name of
your first pet?

00:44:43.315 --> 00:44:45.820
Could you tell me that?

00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:48.070
What was the first street
that you lived?

00:44:48.070 --> 00:44:48.500
Yeah.

00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:49.820
You're all shaking your heads.

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:53.430
It's very easy to recall
historical, factual research,

00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:55.170
because our brains are
wired that way.

00:44:55.170 --> 00:44:57.730
They're wired in a very
vertical way.

00:44:57.730 --> 00:44:59.780
It's when you start to make
lateral associations like the

00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:02.810
ones we just talked about,
that's where the mental engine

00:45:02.810 --> 00:45:04.900
seizes a little bit.

00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:05.910
Let me put you through
an exercise

00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:07.160
and see if this works.

00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:10.920
Please think of a waiter.

00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:16.080
What are the first words that
come to mind when I ask you to

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:17.330
think of a waiter?

00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:21.830
Friendly.

00:45:25.590 --> 00:45:26.740
Busy.

00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:28.350
What else about a waiter?

00:45:28.350 --> 00:45:29.130
What other words come to mind?

00:45:29.130 --> 00:45:30.380
Quick word association.

00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:36.690
Good memory.

00:45:39.210 --> 00:45:40.460
Food?

00:45:42.062 --> 00:45:43.312
Restaurant?

00:45:45.810 --> 00:45:49.480
So those are the words
that you typically

00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:50.490
associate with a waiter.

00:45:50.490 --> 00:45:54.840
Friendly, busy, restaurant,
food, tablecloth, somebody

00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:57.150
said candles.

00:45:57.150 --> 00:46:00.975
Why did nobody say dump truck?

00:46:00.975 --> 00:46:03.390
Caterpillar?

00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:05.640
Dead cat?

00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:07.400
Why wouldn't those be the words
that you would have

00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:09.620
jumped to when I asked you
think of a waiter?

00:46:09.620 --> 00:46:13.230
Why friendly, busy,
helpful, food?

00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:15.510
Why didn't I get any votes for
dump truck or dead cat?

00:46:19.850 --> 00:46:22.450
Because those are logical
associations, and I don't

00:46:22.450 --> 00:46:26.030
typically associate a dead
cat with a waiter.

00:46:26.030 --> 00:46:27.410
And I don't know where you
eat, Brian, back in

00:46:27.410 --> 00:46:29.760
Connecticut, but out in
California, that's not the way

00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:31.570
that things work.

00:46:31.570 --> 00:46:32.920
True.

00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:35.660
Typically you associate a waiter
with logical things

00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:36.970
that you associate
with a waiter.

00:46:36.970 --> 00:46:38.816
But a dead cat doesn't
make sense.

00:46:38.816 --> 00:46:40.910
What I'd like to do, though, is
give you another challenge,

00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:43.380
if you don't mind.

00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:47.390
Pretend you're a consultant,
and you've been hired by a

00:46:47.390 --> 00:46:50.750
failing restaurant to design
a growth strategy for that

00:46:50.750 --> 00:46:52.000
restaurant.

00:46:53.550 --> 00:46:56.810
And the only source of
inspiration is you must use a

00:46:56.810 --> 00:47:01.230
dead cat in all of your ideas
and thoughts to help the

00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:02.480
failing restaurant.

00:47:05.650 --> 00:47:08.880
The knee jerk reaction to that
challenge, real quick.

00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:10.170
Be honest.

00:47:10.170 --> 00:47:11.790
Come on.

00:47:11.790 --> 00:47:13.880
What do you think?

00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:15.590
It's ridiculous.

00:47:15.590 --> 00:47:16.840
Why is it ridiculous?

00:47:21.590 --> 00:47:23.480
They're completely separate.

00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:26.170
Yeah, and most people have the
reaction, that's ridiculous,

00:47:26.170 --> 00:47:28.170
it's silly, it makes no sense.

00:47:28.170 --> 00:47:30.760
And, in fact, I'm not
even going to play.

00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:34.320
You go back to Connecticut
with your dead cat.

00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:36.610
Very common reaction,
thank you.

00:47:36.610 --> 00:47:37.400
But what I'm going
to ask you to do

00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:39.370
for a second is persevere.

00:47:39.370 --> 00:47:45.220
Go beyond the ridiculousness,
and truly now, put yourself in

00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:48.610
that consultant's mind, and see
if you can design a growth

00:47:48.610 --> 00:47:51.775
strategy using a dead
cat as inspiration.

00:47:56.100 --> 00:47:58.447
Give me some thoughts.

00:47:58.447 --> 00:47:59.697
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:14.630
BRIAN KLAPPER: Love it.

00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:17.240
So, dead cats versus live
cats on food wastage.

00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:17.800
Perfect idea.

00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:19.050
What else?

00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:25.093
Yeah.

00:48:25.093 --> 00:48:28.200
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:29.088
BRIAN KLAPPER: OK.

00:48:29.088 --> 00:48:30.338
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:34.350 --> 00:48:34.610
BRIAN KLAPPER: Sure.

00:48:34.610 --> 00:48:36.370
So build a restaurant that's
incredibly flexible,

00:48:36.370 --> 00:48:37.700
incredibly agile.

00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:39.655
Be the agile dead
cat restaurant.

00:48:42.170 --> 00:48:44.660
When I've done this before, I've
heard things like, what

00:48:44.660 --> 00:48:47.890
if we cater to cat lovers, and
we put some warm milk down on

00:48:47.890 --> 00:48:48.790
the bottom of every table?

00:48:48.790 --> 00:48:50.970
So bring your cat,
come on over.

00:48:50.970 --> 00:48:52.750
I've heard Dead Cat Cafe.

00:48:52.750 --> 00:48:56.890
I've heard lots of different
options for how to turn a

00:48:56.890 --> 00:49:01.540
restaurant into a success
story using a dead cat.

00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:03.400
But your first reaction was
the most interesting one,

00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:05.700
which is this is silly.

00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:08.520
The reason it's important, and
the reason I wanted to take

00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:11.130
you through the little exercise
is because this is

00:49:11.130 --> 00:49:14.540
what the front line feels when
they are given an idea that

00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:17.090
they have to go ahead and
implement that they ultimately

00:49:17.090 --> 00:49:20.440
don't think is pragmatic,
it doesn't make sense.

00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:22.870
And we have senior management
said, here's the idea,

00:49:22.870 --> 00:49:24.160
implement away.

00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:26.850
Most people's reaction on the
front line is resistance.

00:49:26.850 --> 00:49:28.630
This is ridiculous, this doesn't
make sense, this

00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:31.690
doesn't tie to my
mental model.

00:49:31.690 --> 00:49:35.040
But if you persevere through it,
there's often some pretty

00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:36.290
good goodness on
the other side.

00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:40.510
But it's not easy.

00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:45.230
Last couple of slides.

00:49:49.110 --> 00:49:51.420
Resistance exists at all
levels, whether it was

00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:55.080
ridiculousness at the dead cat
story, or whether it's trying

00:49:55.080 --> 00:50:00.100
to implement a major change
through an organization.

00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:01.380
Most companies just want
to avoid it and

00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:02.060
hope it goes away.

00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:02.830
It doesn't.

00:50:02.830 --> 00:50:04.370
It doesn't ever go away.

00:50:04.370 --> 00:50:06.920
Best case, you'll get active
resistance, so least you know

00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:07.850
how to help.

00:50:07.850 --> 00:50:09.610
Worst case, it'll be passive,
where people will nod their

00:50:09.610 --> 00:50:11.120
heads, and at the end of the
day, go back to doing what

00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:12.700
they're doing.

00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:15.070
The best way to overcome
resistance is to recognize

00:50:15.070 --> 00:50:20.250
it's there and involve those
resistors into ideation and

00:50:20.250 --> 00:50:21.660
into messaging.

00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:24.140
So the way that I like to work,
typically, is every

00:50:24.140 --> 00:50:26.530
project that I work on, whether
it's large or small,

00:50:26.530 --> 00:50:28.070
always has a defined
time period--

00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:31.170
30 days, never longer.

00:50:31.170 --> 00:50:33.090
Even if it's a large project,
it's the piece of a project

00:50:33.090 --> 00:50:35.230
with a measurable delivery
within 30 days.

00:50:35.230 --> 00:50:36.870
People lose interest
after 30 days.

00:50:36.870 --> 00:50:38.670
Management lose interest
after 30 days.

00:50:38.670 --> 00:50:40.750
So 30 days to deliverable.

00:50:40.750 --> 00:50:43.820
I love to have a pilot working
within 30 days.

00:50:43.820 --> 00:50:45.310
Team composition?

00:50:45.310 --> 00:50:48.290
Love it to be no more than five
to seven people, flat

00:50:48.290 --> 00:50:50.100
out, working hard.

00:50:50.100 --> 00:50:52.820
Think of the analogy of a crew
in scull, when you get to more

00:50:52.820 --> 00:50:55.450
than five, six, eight people,
you have people that are

00:50:55.450 --> 00:50:56.630
coasting, not people
that are working.

00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:59.630
So I like the team size capped
to five to seven, people 30

00:50:59.630 --> 00:51:02.080
day deliverable, quantitative
mandate.

00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:04.960
And make sure the people who are
ideating are the ones that

00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:07.960
are ultimately going to be
response for implementing.

00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:10.650
So make sure the idea comes from
senior management so they

00:51:10.650 --> 00:51:13.750
buy into it, they resource the
project properly, and,

00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:15.990
ultimately, it's the doers,
the ideators, that are

00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:18.420
responsible for implementation.

00:51:18.420 --> 00:51:20.510
And what you're going to find is
you are absolutely going to

00:51:20.510 --> 00:51:23.640
turn resistance into passion,
because people love to

00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:28.680
implement the work that they
had a hand in creating.

00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:34.880
Final thoughts are I know
these talks happen with

00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:38.020
tremendous frequency here, and
hopefully at some of the

00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:40.490
better ones, you're able
to walk away with

00:51:40.490 --> 00:51:42.440
an idea or two that--

00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:44.190
maybe there was a phrase that
said, well, that was kind of

00:51:44.190 --> 00:51:44.410
interesting.

00:51:44.410 --> 00:51:45.170
I learned a little something.

00:51:45.170 --> 00:51:47.930
It was worth giving up my
lunch hour to listen to.

00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:51.860
But what I hope is that you
could take something away from

00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:55.050
this, even if it's just one
concept, and try and implement

00:51:55.050 --> 00:51:57.140
it into your day to day job.

00:51:57.140 --> 00:51:59.930
So, depending on where you
are in the organization--

00:51:59.930 --> 00:52:02.500
whether it is senior management
and it's about

00:52:02.500 --> 00:52:06.090
building a committed team and
living the change you want.

00:52:06.090 --> 00:52:08.360
Whether you're lower in the
organization, and you want to

00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:10.690
hold leaders accountable.

00:52:10.690 --> 00:52:13.920
Whether it's about creating
organizational energy.

00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:16.450
There's clearly tons of energy
here in this building, but

00:52:16.450 --> 00:52:19.340
around a specific project.

00:52:19.340 --> 00:52:21.260
Adopt a personal approach.

00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:23.930
Own the change.

00:52:23.930 --> 00:52:27.400
I hope that some of the lessons
will serve you as you

00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:28.880
go out and continue
your careers.

00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:31.320
So, I wish you the best, and
I thank you very much.
