00:00:00.259 --> 00:00:02.443
- [Voiceover] Let's now
do some examples that

00:00:02.443 --> 00:00:04.387
test our understanding of what happens

00:00:04.387 --> 00:00:06.163
when we multiply or divide a bunch of

00:00:06.163 --> 00:00:08.515
positive or negative numbers together.

00:00:08.515 --> 00:00:11.045
And like always, pause the
video and see if you can

00:00:11.045 --> 00:00:13.973
work through it on your
own before I do it.

00:00:13.973 --> 00:00:18.866
So first question: What is the
sign of s to the 67th power

00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:22.913
divided by t to the
ninth power, divided by

00:00:22.913 --> 00:00:27.511
the expression 3s times s over 4t,

00:00:27.511 --> 00:00:32.278
when s is less than zero,
and t is greater than zero?

00:00:33.094 --> 00:00:34.866
So the really interesting
thing here is that

00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:38.181
s is less than zero, s is negative.

00:00:38.181 --> 00:00:41.650
So if s is a negative number,

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.250
we first have s to the 67th power.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.529
And we just have to remind ourselves,

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:50.202
a negative number being multiplied,

00:00:50.202 --> 00:00:52.169
if you have an odd number
of negative numbers

00:00:52.169 --> 00:00:53.698
being multiplied together,

00:00:53.698 --> 00:00:55.553
you're going to have a negative number.

00:00:55.553 --> 00:00:59.233
And s to the 67th power, that's 67 ses,

00:00:59.233 --> 00:01:02.353
so it's literally s times s times s,

00:01:02.353 --> 00:01:05.073
and you literally are going
to have 67 of these ses,

00:01:05.073 --> 00:01:06.603
and you're multiplying them all together.

00:01:06.603 --> 00:01:09.059
So you have an odd number of ses,

00:01:09.059 --> 00:01:10.555
an odd number of negative numbers

00:01:10.555 --> 00:01:12.259
that you're multiplying together.

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:13.403
So if you have an odd number of

00:01:13.403 --> 00:01:15.426
negative numbers multiplied together?

00:01:15.426 --> 00:01:18.235
Well that means that the
product is going to be negative.

00:01:18.235 --> 00:01:21.514
So this thing right over
here is going to be negative.

00:01:21.514 --> 00:01:23.466
Now what's t to the ninth?

00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:25.905
Well, t is a positive
number, they tell us that.

00:01:25.905 --> 00:01:28.893
They tell us that t is greater than zero.

00:01:28.893 --> 00:01:31.410
Well, a positive number,
really to any power,

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.586
however many you have
that multiply together

00:01:33.586 --> 00:01:35.658
with an even or odd, if
it's just all positive,

00:01:35.658 --> 00:01:37.038
well this is going to be positive.

00:01:37.038 --> 00:01:39.594
So this thing right over
here is going to be positive.

00:01:39.594 --> 00:01:42.770
Now what's a negative
divided by a positive?

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.162
Well a negative divided by a positive

00:01:45.162 --> 00:01:46.986
is going to be negative.

00:01:46.986 --> 00:01:49.354
We've already seen that show before.

00:01:49.354 --> 00:01:52.913
So this whole thing,
I'll circle it like that,

00:01:52.913 --> 00:01:55.593
is going to be a negative.

00:01:55.593 --> 00:01:57.212
And so that this thing
doesn't get too messy,

00:01:57.212 --> 00:01:58.849
actually let me just rewrite this.

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:01.673
So all of this stuff that
we've written over here,

00:02:01.673 --> 00:02:03.384
I'll just write this
as this is going to be

00:02:03.384 --> 00:02:05.559
some negative number,

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:07.956
and then we're going to divide it by

00:02:07.956 --> 00:02:12.533
3s times s over 4t.

00:02:13.856 --> 00:02:15.829
Now this expression right over here.

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:18.573
What is s divided by 4t going to be?

00:02:18.573 --> 00:02:20.467
Is that going to be positive or negative?

00:02:20.467 --> 00:02:22.932
Well we know that s is negative.

00:02:22.932 --> 00:02:26.195
T is positive, so four times
t is going to be positive.

00:02:26.195 --> 00:02:29.076
So this thing right over
here is going to be positive.

00:02:29.076 --> 00:02:31.549
Negative divided by positive,

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:33.429
well that's going to be a negative.

00:02:33.429 --> 00:02:36.293
So actually let me just write it this way.

00:02:36.293 --> 00:02:38.764
So all of this stuff, I
could just replace with

00:02:38.764 --> 00:02:41.722
s divided by 4t is going to be a negative.

00:02:41.722 --> 00:02:44.850
So times a negative, times
some other negative number.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.707
Now what's 3s?

00:02:46.707 --> 00:02:49.066
Well s is negative, so 3s is negative.

00:02:49.066 --> 00:02:50.698
So that is negative, so you have

00:02:50.698 --> 00:02:52.154
a negative times a negative.

00:02:52.154 --> 00:02:54.364
Which is a positive.

00:02:54.364 --> 00:02:56.431
So all of this business right over here

00:02:56.431 --> 00:02:58.318
is going to be positive.

00:02:58.318 --> 00:02:59.754
Another way you could think about it is

00:02:59.754 --> 00:03:02.708
you're going to have a
negative times a negative,

00:03:02.708 --> 00:03:05.849
which is positive, and then
divide that by a positive,

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:07.662
it's just going to be positive.

00:03:09.932 --> 00:03:12.205
So all of that,

00:03:12.205 --> 00:03:14.903
so this whole thing, all of
this business right over here,

00:03:14.903 --> 00:03:16.904
is going to be a positive.

00:03:16.904 --> 00:03:19.301
This is all a negative,
this is a positive.

00:03:19.301 --> 00:03:21.869
You're gonna have a negative
divided by a positive.

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:25.101
Well that's just going to be negative.

00:03:25.101 --> 00:03:28.373
So the sign of this crazy
expression right over here?

00:03:28.373 --> 00:03:31.154
It's going to be negative
if s is less than zero

00:03:31.154 --> 00:03:33.500
and t is greater than zero.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.357
Let's keep going, this is fun.

00:03:35.357 --> 00:03:36.764
All right.

00:03:36.764 --> 00:03:41.173
So what is the sign of p times q over p,

00:03:41.173 --> 00:03:44.759
times four and 2/7, when
p is greater than zero,

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:47.452
and q is equal to zero.

00:03:47.452 --> 00:03:50.339
And the way I just
stressed q is equal to zero

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:51.836
should be a big hint.

00:03:51.836 --> 00:03:53.012
And let me give you another hint.

00:03:53.012 --> 00:03:55.116
Pause the video, if you really think about

00:03:55.116 --> 00:03:57.580
what I just said, that q is equal to zero,

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.963
you should be able to do
this in less than a second.

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:03.810
So why did I say that you could do this

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.434
in less than a second?

00:04:05.434 --> 00:04:07.034
Well if you just have a bunch of numbers,

00:04:07.034 --> 00:04:09.425
and then you multiply them times
zero at some point in that,

00:04:09.425 --> 00:04:12.546
the whole thing is just
going to be equal to zero.

00:04:12.546 --> 00:04:17.041
I could literally have a
times b times c times d,

00:04:17.041 --> 00:04:19.435
I could multiply a bunch of numbers.

00:04:19.435 --> 00:04:21.889
And if I just knew that one
of these numbers is zero,

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:24.195
then the whole product is
going to be equal to zero.

00:04:24.195 --> 00:04:26.634
You know if c is equal
to zero, I could multiply

00:04:26.634 --> 00:04:29.338
a times b times d times
e and get some number,

00:04:29.338 --> 00:04:30.929
and then multiply that times c,

00:04:30.929 --> 00:04:32.657
it's gonna be anything times zero is zero.

00:04:32.657 --> 00:04:36.889
Now notice, q is equal to
zero, and q is right over here.

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:40.937
So I could take p divided
by p, that's gonna be one.

00:04:40.937 --> 00:04:43.598
One times q, that's just gonna be zero,

00:04:43.598 --> 00:04:44.601
as one times zero is zero,

00:04:44.601 --> 00:04:46.361
then you're gonna have
zero times four and 2/7,

00:04:46.361 --> 00:04:48.665
it's just all gonna be zero.

00:04:48.665 --> 00:04:51.196
And the key is, there's
a zero right over here.

00:04:51.196 --> 00:04:52.504
At some point you're multiplying

00:04:52.504 --> 00:04:53.985
this entire product times zero,

00:04:53.985 --> 00:04:55.712
so the whole product is going,

00:04:55.712 --> 00:04:57.257
or you're multiplying
these numbers times zero,

00:04:57.257 --> 00:04:59.656
so the whole product is going to be zero.

00:04:59.656 --> 00:05:02.696
So this side isn't positive
or negative, it's zero.

00:05:03.915 --> 00:05:05.730
All right, there's no sign there.

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:07.261
It's neither positive nor negative.

00:05:07.261 --> 00:05:08.662
All right, let's do another one.

00:05:08.662 --> 00:05:10.339
What is the sign of negative 3/4

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:13.114
times negative a to the fourth over three,

00:05:13.114 --> 00:05:14.819
when a is less than zero?

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:17.315
So they're telling us that a is negative.

00:05:17.315 --> 00:05:19.706
So a is negative.

00:05:19.706 --> 00:05:22.962
So let me use a more dramatic color.

00:05:22.962 --> 00:05:25.684
So right over here, I have a

00:05:25.684 --> 00:05:27.899
negative number to the fourth power.

00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:30.913
So it's a times a times a times a.

00:05:30.913 --> 00:05:33.789
And we've already said if
you have an even number

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:36.730
of negatives being
multiplied by each other,

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:39.121
then that's going to be a positive.

00:05:39.121 --> 00:05:40.313
You could even see it over here,

00:05:40.313 --> 00:05:41.900
I mean they're all
negative, but a negative

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.249
times a negative is
going to be a positive.

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:46.233
A negative times the
negative, I take the third

00:05:46.233 --> 00:05:48.488
and the fourth one here,
that's gonna be a positive.

00:05:48.488 --> 00:05:49.921
And then a positive times a positive,

00:05:49.921 --> 00:05:53.122
the whole thing is going to be positive,

00:05:53.122 --> 00:05:54.991
even though each of these are negative.

00:05:54.991 --> 00:05:57.041
Negative times negative, or
another way you could say it,

00:05:57.041 --> 00:05:59.472
a times a is going to be positive,

00:05:59.472 --> 00:06:01.097
then times a is going to be negative,

00:06:01.097 --> 00:06:02.640
but then you multiply times a again,

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.498
it's going to be positive again.

00:06:04.498 --> 00:06:07.779
So a to the fourth power
is going to be positive.

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:10.460
But then you have a
negative in front of it.

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.084
So you're taking the negative of a

00:06:12.084 --> 00:06:14.371
positive divided by a positive,

00:06:14.371 --> 00:06:16.841
Well, so this, all of this stuff

00:06:16.841 --> 00:06:18.603
right over here is all gonna be positive,

00:06:18.603 --> 00:06:20.363
but then you have this negative in front.

00:06:20.363 --> 00:06:23.678
So this entire thing
inside the parentheses

00:06:23.678 --> 00:06:26.394
is going to be a negative.

00:06:26.394 --> 00:06:29.627
And then you have a
negative, negative 3/4,

00:06:29.627 --> 00:06:32.938
times a negative, well a
negative times a negative,

00:06:32.938 --> 00:06:36.005
the whole thing is going to be positive.

00:06:36.005 --> 00:06:37.267
So what's the sign of this?

00:06:37.267 --> 00:06:39.770
It's going to be positive.

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.210
Let's do another one,
I'm having too much fun.

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:45.394
All right, what is the sign
of x to the 59th power,

00:06:45.394 --> 00:06:48.964
divided by 2.3x times 4/5,

00:06:48.964 --> 00:06:51.387
when x is less than zero?

00:06:51.387 --> 00:06:53.786
So x is once again a negative number.

00:06:53.786 --> 00:06:57.132
So x to the 59th power,
that's an odd number

00:06:57.132 --> 00:06:59.681
of negatives being multiplied together.

00:06:59.681 --> 00:07:02.697
So this thing right over
here is going to be negative.

00:07:02.697 --> 00:07:05.115
That's going to be
negative right over there.

00:07:05.115 --> 00:07:08.135
And this x right over here
is going to be negative.

00:07:08.135 --> 00:07:11.985
And so 2.3 times that x,
well that's going to be

00:07:11.985 --> 00:07:15.678
negative as well, so this
thing is going to be negative.

00:07:15.678 --> 00:07:17.739
That's going to be negative.

00:07:17.739 --> 00:07:20.811
A negative divided by a
negative, is a positive.

00:07:20.811 --> 00:07:24.102
So all of this business
is going to be a positive.

00:07:24.102 --> 00:07:26.372
A positive times a positive,

00:07:26.372 --> 00:07:28.143
well that's just gonna be positive.

00:07:28.143 --> 00:07:32.052
So all of this whole thing
is going to be positive.

00:07:32.052 --> 00:07:35.174
I can't stop, this is, all right.

00:07:35.174 --> 00:07:40.089
What is the sign of negative
x, times y divided by 7/8?

00:07:40.089 --> 00:07:43.547
And here they're showing us
x and y on a number line.

00:07:43.547 --> 00:07:46.761
And the key takeaways here
is that x is positive,

00:07:46.761 --> 00:07:50.283
x is to the right of zero, y is negative.

00:07:52.122 --> 00:07:53.999
So let's think about this.

00:07:53.999 --> 00:07:56.210
X is positive, but then we're taking

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:58.843
the negative of x right over here.

00:07:58.843 --> 00:08:02.515
So x is positive but negative
of x is going to be negative.

00:08:02.515 --> 00:08:04.669
You bring a negative number
in front of a positive number,

00:08:04.669 --> 00:08:06.771
that's going to be a negative number.

00:08:06.771 --> 00:08:09.091
Now what's y divided by 7/8?

00:08:09.091 --> 00:08:11.283
Y is a negative number.

00:08:13.666 --> 00:08:16.450
I'm dividing it by a positive number.

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:18.580
So a negative divided by a positive

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:20.322
is going to be a negative.

00:08:20.322 --> 00:08:23.226
So this whole expression,
this whole expression

00:08:23.226 --> 00:08:25.754
right over here, is going to be negative.

00:08:25.754 --> 00:08:28.537
And then we have a
negative, all of this stuff,

00:08:28.537 --> 00:08:31.084
times a negative, well
that's going to give us

00:08:31.084 --> 00:08:33.081
a positive.

00:08:33.081 --> 00:08:36.990
So the whole thing here
is going to be positive.
