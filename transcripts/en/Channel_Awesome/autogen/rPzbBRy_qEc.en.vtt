figment of her imagination or ghosts I
 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.280 align:start position:0%

mean<00:06:44.950><c> his</c><00:06:45.430><c> powers</c><00:06:46.030><c> did</c><00:06:46.300><c> reside</c><00:06:46.720><c> in</c><00:06:46.960><c> the</c><00:06:47.080><c> mind</c>

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:47.290 align:start position:0%
mean his powers did reside in the mind
 

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
