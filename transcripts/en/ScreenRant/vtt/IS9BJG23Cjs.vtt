00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.540
Metaphorically it takes blood and guts to
perform certain roles in blockbuster films

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.530
but sometimes that blood and guts are actually
required.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.860
Some of your favorite actors in some awesome
films have hurt themselves on set but like

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.360
true performers they finished their roles.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.939
The show must go on as they say, despite these
injuries even if they were life-threatening.

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:26.070

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:46.290
Here is Screen Rant’s list of ten Actors
Who Took it Too Far on Set.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.770
Tom Holland in Captain America: Civil War

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.489
Before Tom Holland showed up on screen in
Captain America: Civil War there was of course

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.190
naysayers about his casting as Spider-Man.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.360
Anytime someone is helmed to play a role there
is a group of fans that complain and Holland

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.030
was not safe from this.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.330
Before a trailer even came out Holand talked
about an on set stumble that gave him bruises

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.970
and gashes across his face.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.890
Sadly, this wasn’t because of an elaborate
stunt but because of his coordination and

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.390
this sparked rumors that he wasn’t qualified
to be Spider-Man.

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:22.890
Luckily he proved all those pessimists wrong
and was a great addiction to Civil War.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.259
The Cast in Suicide Squad

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.759
Director David Ayer saw numerous blunders
on set of Suicide Squad from his cast during

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:30.759
production.

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:34.850
Star Will Smith tore his calf right out the
gate forcing him to be out for 6 weeks than

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.970
a few days later Joel Kinnaman, who played
Rick Flag blew out his calf.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.229
Kinnaman joked that he did it out of sympathy
for Smith but no one had it as bad as Margot

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.229
Robbie.

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.700
She did the same stunts as the men but in
high heels and in much less clothing, we mean

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:49.700
padding.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.920
At one point she thought she broke her ribs
but she actually just pulled her muscle off

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.141
her ribs and that made her stunts painful
for the rest of filming but didn’t stop

00:01:57.141 --> 00:01:58.939
her from stealing the show.

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:03.390
Here is a trivia question for you, did Margot
Robbie learn to hold her breath, fist fight

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.960
or sword fight for her role of Harley Quinn?

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.950
The answer will be at the end of our video.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.770
Brad Pitt in Se7en

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.680
Brad Pitt worked himself to the bone in the
1994 film Se7ev, literally.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.690
When Detective David Mills chases the killer
through a rainy street he slipped and his

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.330
arm went through a windshield.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.739
The glass cut his arm so deep that it severed
a tendon and went down to the bone.

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.730
His injury was so severe he had to wear a
cast for the rest of the film so they had

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.970
to write his injury into the script, rather
than halt production for numerous months.

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.800
At least he didn’t lose his head.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.480
Robert Downey Jr. in Iron Man 3

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.280
At the time of Iron Man 3’s production Robert
Downey Jr. was 47 years old and while portraying

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.350
the comic book hero in Marvel's blockbuster
movie franchise he wounded himself.

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.160
While performing a stunt the actor twisted
his ankle causing him to be out of work for

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.489
5 weeks, which is very costly to productions.

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:01.240
Don’t even try to tell us RDJ is too old
to be performing stunts because since then

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.840
he has clashed with Ultron and Captain America
keeping his own; not to mention he looked

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.850
awesome doing it.

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.129
Elsa Fisher in Now You See Me

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:15.720
When you are using a chainsaw to cut a woman
in half there is always a chance of a mistake

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.190
happening and some magicians will claim a
water tank act is even more dangerous.

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.379
Elsa Fisher might be one of those that believes
a water tank can become a coffin because she

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:27.720
almost died in one on the set of Now You See
Me.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.019
During a take she was supposed to escape chains
and free herself from a tank but she got tangled

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:33.330
and almost drowned.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.280
She signaled for help but they thought she
was acting and didn’t come to her aid, luckily

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.980
she freed herself and went on to act another
day.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.260
Ben Affleck in Batman V Superman: Dawn of
Justice

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.360
Ben Affleck has desired to be a superhero
mega star for a long time, that’s why he

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.939
took the role of Daredevil and gave it his
all in Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice.

00:03:55.939 --> 00:04:00.170
While shooting the film, the Batman actor
hurt his shoulder so bad that his stunt double

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.799
had to perform minor lifting scenes for the
star.

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:06.980
Affleck was used to playing characters with
minor physical requirements before this role

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.280
and the speed he prepared for this role might
have been too fast.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.420
We can’t wait to see him kick some butt
in the next Batman film he’s involved with,

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.120
hopefully injury free.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.340
Here is your next trivia question, fill in
the blank.

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.180
Ben Affleck directed the 2007 film blank Baby
blank.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.020
The answer is coming up soon.

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.370
Halle Berry in Gothika

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.660
Robert Downey Jr. has been known as a prolific
actor for a long time to fans and the film

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:31.660
industry alike.

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.220
His role as Chaplin garnered him a much deserved
Academy Award nomination and today he wows

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.120
us with his performance as Iron Man in the
marvel films.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.190
He gets so into his roles that he sometimes
forgets himself and during a scene with Halle

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.220
Berry in Gothika he accidentally hurt the
actress.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.620
The scene is when he had to restrain Berry
and hold her arms down, as he held her down

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:51.800
he broke her arm.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.930
The moment RDJ heard the pop, he stopped and
she was treated, they are still friends today

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:03.410
and she holds nothing against him.

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.639
Channing Tatum in Foxcatcher

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:09.580
Channing Tatum wanted to show his acting chops
with 2014’s Foxcatcher.

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.370
In the scene where his character has a breakdown
in a hotel room, he breaks a mirror with his

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.139
head but despite precautions he still got
hurt.

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:19.840
The mirror had a plastic sleeve attached to
it to protect Tatum but the actor went too

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.800
far and bashed his head three times into the
mirror.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.000
He broke the mirror, the frame and the wall
behind the mirror, not to mention he cut his

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000
head too.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:35.070
You can actually see his blood in the movie,
no makeup artist was needed.

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.650
Vin Diesel in Fast and Furious 7

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.410
Fist fights with Jason Stratham, beatings
with lead pipes, being slammed against cars

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:46.289
and minor concussions sounds like a typical
day on set of the Fast and Furious franchise.

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:50.400
Especially if you are the star and producer
of these films, Vin Diesel.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.650
During production of Fast and Furious 7, Diesel
hurt himself and was rushed to the hospital

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:55.960
because of a concussion.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:00.160
He doesn’t know how he got the concussion
because the day he did receive it he was performing

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.270
numerous stunts.

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:05.259
We’re betting Michele Rodriguez got upset
with him and showed him why she’s one of

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:07.630
the coolest female action stars around.

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.940
Here is your last trivia question that we’ll
be giving you the answer soon.

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:16.050
Which Steven Spielberg war film was Vin Diesel
in?

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:19.970
The Rock in Central Intelligence

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:24.330
Two guys that love social media as much as
social media loves them is Dwayne Johnson

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.340
and Kevin Hart, so when they were making their
film Central Intelligence Johnson decided

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:29.669
to hoax his audience.

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:34.000
He showed how even a broken finger can’t
make him shed a tear with an Instagram video

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.460
but it’s easy not to shed a tear when you’re
using a prosthetic finger.

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:41.919
The actor was fine but we bet he wished he
was using a prosthetic head when Hart slams

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:44.320
a door shut and a tile crashed down on his
head.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:48.470
He’s lucky the pointy side of the tile didn’t
get him and Hart is lucky The Rock has a sense

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:51.520
of humor because he laughed at the body-builders
misfortune.

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.710
There you have it ten Actors Who Took it Too
Far on Set.

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.000
Here are the answers to our trivia questions:

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.580
Margot Robbie learn to hold her breath for
her role of Harley Quinn.

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:04.250
Ben Affleck directed the 2007 film Gone Baby
Gone.

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:07.410
Steven Spielberg casted Vin Diesel in Saving
Private Ryan.
