00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.950
This is Mark Wiens with eating Thai food dot
com and today I'm going to make a recipe for

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:14.129
gaeng keow wan gai, which is green curry with
chicken, and magic of this dish lies within

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:21.770
the kung gang, which is the curry paste, this
big blob of green stuff, that's the stuff

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:28.570
we're looking for today and this is the flavor
that will give us the deliciousness of the

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:29.570
green curry we're about to cook.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.410
Let's go over the ingredients real fast.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.620
You'll need about a quarter of a chicken chopped
up, or if you want, two chicken breasts will

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.180
work fine as well.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:43.820
You'll need twelve Thai round eggplants, five
non-hot spur chillies, three to four stems

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:50.470
of Thai sweet basil, six to eight kaffir lime
leaves, around six cups of coconut milk, I'll

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.920
be using fresh but you can easily buy it in
a can, four heaping tablespoons of thai green

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.150
curry paste, since I'm in Thailand I'll be
using fresh curry paste, but you can easily

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.540
find it in a bottle or package.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.760
You'll also need about a half a tablespoon
of fermented shrimp paste which is also available

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.640
in a can, two teaspoons of sugar and one teaspoon
of salt.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.159
The first thing you need to do in cut the
chicken.

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.439
If you're using a chicken leg, you'll have
to chop it with a big knife, but if you're

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:23.530
using chicken breasts, you'll just need to
slice them up into the bite sized pieces.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.600
Wash all twelve of the eggplants and cut them
into quarters.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.840
Add all your ingredients to a plate, but keep
them separate as you'll be adding them at

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.109
different times.

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:43.570
Then chop the five spur chillies into slivers.

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.530
The next step is to pluck all the leaves off
three to four stems of Thai sweet basil and

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.619
put them aside.

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:56.090
Roughly cut six to eight kaffir lime leaves,
you can even just crumple up them with your

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.630
hands.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.299
Start by pouring five cups of coconut milk
into a medium sized pot and put it on medium

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.539
heat.

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:11.060
When the coconut milk is still heating up,
stir in around four tablespoons of Thai green

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.159
curry paste.

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:15.730
Make sure it all dissolves into the coconut
milk.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:26.060
Then stir in half of a tablespoon of fermented
shrimp paste.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:38.000
Allow the mixture to get very hot.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.040
But just before it comes to a boil add the
eight kaffir lime leaves and then put in all

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.750
the chopped pieces of chicken.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.549
Be sure to put them in carefully so they don't
splash all over the place.

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:56.909
Stir the curry for a few seconds and then
just let it sit for about three minutes until

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:07.599
it comes to a rolling boil.

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:14.420
After the curry boils, give it a quick stir
and then leave it again for one more minute.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:26.810
Then you need to add all the eggplant to the
curry.

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:33.700
Stir it for about thirty seconds.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.950
If the curry becomes too thick, add another
half to full cup of coconut milk.

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:49.780
You want the consistency to be somewhere in-between
a watery soup and a gravy.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:04:01.680
After stirring it up, add two teaspoons of
sugar followed by one teaspoon of salt.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.780
This is also the time to taste the curry and
see if it needs any more curry paste for flavor

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.359
or salt.

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:14.430
If the flavor is not strong enough, go ahead
and add another spoon of green curry paste.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.970
Make sure the green curry is well mixed and
then boil it for about five minutes while

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.830
occasionally giving it a quick stir.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:28.850
The final step is to add the sliced spur chillies
and the sweet basil into the curry and immediately

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:30.250
turn off the heat.

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.570
The existing heat from the coconut milk will
cook the sweet basil long enough so it still

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.320
remains fragrant.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.760
Give the curry a quick stir and it's ready
to be served.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.810
Like most Thai curries, make sure you eat
this Thai green chicken curry with a plate

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:46.530
of rice!
