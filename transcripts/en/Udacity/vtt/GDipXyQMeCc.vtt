Hi, I'm Kathleen. I'm going to be the instructor in this course, this summer.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.552
I'm really enthusiastic about this udacity class. I've been teaching for about

00:00:09.552 --> 00:00:13.322
fifteen years, and most of that time I've been teaching online and I think it's

00:00:13.322 --> 00:00:18.607
really an outstanding way to learn things. In a few moments, you'll meet Kai

00:00:18.607 --> 00:00:22.100
and Sarah. They developed this course, and you'll being seeing more of them

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.492
throughout the semester. First, let's look at some of the things you need to

00:00:26.492 --> 00:00:30.466
know in order to be successful. We've worked hard to give you lots of practice,

00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:34.800
so you can learn to program. There are lots of in-lesson exercises. See these

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.802
blue and gray rectangles? The circles indicate practice questions. They will

00:00:38.802 --> 00:00:42.642
turn blue as you progress through the content. Completing these exercises will

00:00:42.642 --> 00:00:46.670
prepare you for the problem set. And you need to complete 80% to pass the

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.394
class. These exercises take the place of labs that are required in on-campus

00:00:51.394 --> 00:00:56.238
classes. You can try exercises as many times as you want. All that matters is

00:00:56.238 --> 00:01:00.119
that you learn to do them. No one counts the number of attempts.
