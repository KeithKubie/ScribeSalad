00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.860
Knowledge based approaches rely on
experts to develop a set of rules

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.770
that describe the normal and legitimate
behaviors observed during training.

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:15.290
For example, these rules can classify
activities into different classes.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.440
For example, a rule can say that
a secretary typically only uses

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.100
office productivity programs
such as web browser, email,

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.810
calendar, and Microsoft Office.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.500
These rules are quite robust and

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.850
flexible because it's relatively
easy to update and improve them.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.910
On the other hand, these approaches
rely on manual efforts by the experts,

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.180
and the experts must have very
good knowledge of the data.
