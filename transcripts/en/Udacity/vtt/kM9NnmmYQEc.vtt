00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.240
&gt;&gt; Okay Michael, what's the answer?

00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:04.680
&gt;&gt; I don't know, but I would, here's how I'd get it. I'd set the equations

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.240
of the two lines equal and find the p where the, where those values are equal.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.600
&gt;&gt; Oh, okay. So here let's do that.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:15.030
&gt;&gt; And I feel like that's like 25 p on one side and ten on the other

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:15.408
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:15.408 --> 00:00:20.510
&gt;&gt; So like 10 over 25, which is like 2 over 5, which is, like, 2 over 5.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.110
&gt;&gt; Yes, which is also 0.4. So 0.4, that's exactly right, and it's,

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:26.830
you should do it exactly the way you said. Set

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.550
the two equations equal to one another, do simple algebra, and.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.990
&gt;&gt; So what would have happened if p ended up being, like, not a probability?

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.330
&gt;&gt; Then they wouldn't have crossed inside.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.640
&gt;&gt; Good point.
