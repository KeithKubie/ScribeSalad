00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.981
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well you have learned a lot about lines. We've learned about slope. We've

00:00:03.981 --> 00:00:08.241
learned about equations of lines. We've learned about horizontal and vertical

00:00:08.241 --> 00:00:12.292
lines. Let's do some practice problems, shall we? For this first practice

00:00:12.292 --> 00:00:16.109
problem, I want you to find the equation of the line. The first line is a

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.452
vertical line that goes through the point negative 5, 6. You can put your answer

00:00:20.452 --> 00:00:24.942
here. For the second one, I want you to find the equation of a horizontal line

00:00:24.942 --> 00:00:29.328
that goes through the point negative 5, 6. And you can put your answer in this

00:00:29.328 --> 00:00:33.454
box. If you're not sure how to solve these problems, feel free to go back and

00:00:33.454 --> 00:00:37.451
review the videos on horizontal and vertical lines before you answer.
