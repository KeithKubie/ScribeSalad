I'm very often asked what is the

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140
I'm very often asked what is the
 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.200
I'm very often asked what is the
Darwinian survival value of religion and

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210
Darwinian survival value of religion and
 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.090
Darwinian survival value of religion and
I usually reply that maybe the wrong

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:11.100
I usually reply that maybe the wrong
 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.279

question you may have to rephrase the

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:13.289
question you may have to rephrase the
 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:15.470
question you may have to rephrase the
question and it may turn out to be not

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480
question and it may turn out to be not
 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.270
question and it may turn out to be not
the survival value of religion but the

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:17.280
the survival value of religion but the
 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.310
the survival value of religion but the
survival value of something else in the

circumstances now a good analogy which

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:25.530
circumstances now a good analogy which
 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:30.050
circumstances now a good analogy which
I've used is the question why do moths

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060
I've used is the question why do moths
 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.410
I've used is the question why do moths
fly into candle flames now you could

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420
fly into candle flames now you could
 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.979
fly into candle flames now you could
describe that behavior as suicidal

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989

if an animal wants to move in a straight

if an animal wants to move in a straight
 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.580
if an animal wants to move in a straight
line a very good way to do it is to keep

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590
line a very good way to do it is to keep
 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.550
line a very good way to do it is to keep
a celestial object at a fixed angle and

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560
a celestial object at a fixed angle and
 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.110
a celestial object at a fixed angle and
that's easy to do in insects because

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:15.120
that's easy to do in insects because
 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.750
that's easy to do in insects because
they have compound eyes where very

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:17.760
they have compound eyes where very
 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.880

tubes looking outwards and so you can

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390
tubes looking outwards and so you can
 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.810
tubes looking outwards and so you can
maintain a fixed angle to something like

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820
maintain a fixed angle to something like
 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.450
maintain a fixed angle to something like
a star or the moon by keeping the moon

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460
a star or the moon by keeping the moon
 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.280
a star or the moon by keeping the moon
in one or more tedium if you do that

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290
in one or more tedium if you do that
 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.710
in one or more tedium if you do that
because rays from the moon come from

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720
because rays from the moon come from
 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.170
because rays from the moon come from
optical Infinity they are parallel and

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180
optical Infinity they are parallel and
 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.600
optical Infinity they are parallel and
so if you keep the moon in one or more

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610
so if you keep the moon in one or more
 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.660
so if you keep the moon in one or more
tedium you will fly in a straight line

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670
tedium you will fly in a straight line
 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.480
tedium you will fly in a straight line
it might be say 30 degrees keep the moon

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490
it might be say 30 degrees keep the moon
 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.420
it might be say 30 degrees keep the moon
at 30 degrees to your right and that

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430
at 30 degrees to your right and that
 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.890
at 30 degrees to your right and that
works and that's valuable and that's

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900
works and that's valuable and that's
 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.640
works and that's valuable and that's
what many insects do however candles are

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650
what many insects do however candles are
 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.740
