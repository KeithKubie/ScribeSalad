00:00:01.752 --> 00:00:03.155
- When I see stuff like this,

00:00:03.155 --> 00:00:06.636
I see what's probably a teenager
headed down the wrong path.

00:00:06.636 --> 00:00:09.083
So I decided to catch
a teen doing graffiti

00:00:09.083 --> 00:00:11.169
and then warn his parents before he turns

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:12.644
to a life of crime.

00:00:12.644 --> 00:00:15.969
To do this, I created a
series of fake promotional

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:18.992
posters for my TV Show
that may seem innocuous,

00:00:18.992 --> 00:00:20.527
but to an immature vandal,

00:00:20.527 --> 00:00:23.231
would be extremely tempting to deface.

00:00:23.231 --> 00:00:24.777
To see which one would work best,

00:00:24.777 --> 00:00:26.550
we left the posters up for a week

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.716
at several locations around
the City of Los Angeles.

00:00:29.716 --> 00:00:31.220
To my surprise,

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.136
The Every Penny Counts poster,

00:00:33.136 --> 00:00:35.241
Risk Equals Reward,

00:00:35.241 --> 00:00:37.054
Tie Shoes For Safety,

00:00:37.054 --> 00:00:38.527
and Be Flexible,

00:00:38.527 --> 00:00:41.089
didn't attract any graffiti at all.

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:45.256
However, Dream Big and Stand
Up to the Big Guys did.

00:00:47.964 --> 00:00:49.926
I decided to go with
Stand Up to the Big Guys

00:00:49.926 --> 00:00:52.085
since there was opportunity for two dicks

00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:55.607
and put it up on a wall
near a local high school.

00:00:55.607 --> 00:00:58.113
I left a pen and added a
sticker that would make

00:00:58.113 --> 00:01:02.062
the act even more irresistible
to an immature smart alec.

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:03.668
With all the elements in place,

00:01:03.668 --> 00:01:05.658
I watched from a van across the street

00:01:05.658 --> 00:01:08.158
ready to pounce at any moment.
