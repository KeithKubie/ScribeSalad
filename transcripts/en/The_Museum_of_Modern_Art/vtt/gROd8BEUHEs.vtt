My name is Anouk Kruithof.

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.006
The work in this show
is entitled Subconscious Travelling.

00:00:06.215 --> 00:00:12.373
It started by me finding an album
just at a second-hand market,

00:00:12.513 --> 00:00:18.443
and it was apparently an album
with empty negative sleeves

00:00:18.603 --> 00:00:21.021
of someone's travel archive.

00:00:21.521 --> 00:00:25.346
I could tell this because there
were some indications of countries

00:00:25.485 --> 00:00:29.613
and a lot of numbers,
which I didn’t understand.

00:00:29.905 --> 00:00:33.766
It really got my attention
because I also come

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.161
from an analog
photographic background,

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.648
and have always learned
when you work with negatives

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.835
in all different formats,
6x6, 6x7, 35 mm,

00:00:43.126 --> 00:00:46.841
you would keep this in the sleeves
to protect from dust.

00:00:47.006 --> 00:00:49.625
And those pages,
they were cardboard pages,

00:00:49.758 --> 00:00:54.271
all the negative sleeves are cut
and really quite beautiful,

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.808
formal compositions
made out of the sleeves.

00:00:58.183 --> 00:01:00.478
And I have no idea
why you would do that

00:01:00.645 --> 00:01:04.725
so it was for me like a catch
that I was very excited about.

00:01:04.856 --> 00:01:09.311
Like, why did someone do this,
what are these travel photos about?

00:01:09.445 --> 00:01:13.115
So it had this mystery
which got my attention,

00:01:13.281 --> 00:01:16.535
and then I started to work with it.

00:01:16.701 --> 00:01:23.045
So I thought of the idea of how
we now travel and record the world,

00:01:23.208 --> 00:01:27.596
which is obviously an iPhone
or telephones which we always,

00:01:27.755 --> 00:01:29.756
everyone carries with them,

00:01:29.965 --> 00:01:36.230
and we outsource those memories
or our travel memories to our phones

00:01:36.388 --> 00:01:37.658
or maybe the internet.

00:01:37.806 --> 00:01:44.826
And also we look at the travel photos
of others online so in that way

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.193
I feel we travel as well
through imagery of others,

00:01:49.901 --> 00:01:53.468
and we can see the world
through photos which we never made

00:01:53.615 --> 00:01:54.746
or never experienced.

00:01:54.906 --> 00:02:00.378
So I started to photograph every page
with my iPhone with a flash,

00:02:00.538 --> 00:02:03.836
and these photos,
the 99 photos came out

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.085
very straightforward and simple,

00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:08.420
and that developed
into this installation

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.631
of the photo stickers on the wall
and the pieces of glass.

00:02:12.216 --> 00:02:15.381
So, I would like to focus
on some specific details

00:02:15.511 --> 00:02:17.733
as I connect it
to that specific piece,

00:02:17.888 --> 00:02:19.056
Subconscious Travelling.

00:02:19.431 --> 00:02:22.060
The use of stickers,
the use of iPhone,

00:02:22.518 --> 00:02:23.686
and the use of flash,

00:02:23.936 --> 00:02:25.480
can you elaborate on these?

00:02:25.646 --> 00:02:29.060
Yeah, of course the flash,
when you start with that,

00:02:29.191 --> 00:02:30.901
you photograph with and without.

00:02:31.276 --> 00:02:33.800
And obviously,
it needed to be an iPhone,

00:02:33.946 --> 00:02:38.011
because I felt I'm going to travel
through this album of the absence

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:45.061
of that imagery
and its plastic sleeves.

00:02:45.208 --> 00:02:47.626
So I find it interesting
when I flashed it,

00:02:47.793 --> 00:02:50.636
that obviously
you get the reflection,

00:02:50.796 --> 00:02:54.236
so it creates an absence
of pixels, actually,

00:02:54.383 --> 00:03:00.063
which to me also relates
to memory loss or lost data,

00:03:00.223 --> 00:03:03.131
but also in more human way,
loss of memory

00:03:03.266 --> 00:03:07.118
like the absence of that
which struck me.

00:03:07.271 --> 00:03:11.126
And then, yeah, then you
get an opportunity to show the work,

00:03:11.275 --> 00:03:19.308
and I start to think about the very
kind of a not pretentious way

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.328
of showing photographs,

00:03:22.786 --> 00:03:25.915
which is very much
this matte sticker material,

00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:27.458
and it's very straightforward.

00:03:27.625 --> 00:03:31.588
It's and also directly
on the wall of a museum.

00:03:31.753 --> 00:03:35.886
I really like it because it feels
like you transferred the work,

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.105
and you make it part
of the walls or the institution.

00:03:40.263 --> 00:03:44.558
It's less an object
or it has less barriers

00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:48.726
to the photographic object,
the photo, the print and the wall.

00:03:48.893 --> 00:03:49.855
It's more one.

00:03:50.981 --> 00:03:55.361
And then I decided
to use a few pieces of glass,

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.823
make it more relating
to obvious framing, for example.

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:02.160
But on the other hand,
I also thought

00:04:02.368 --> 00:04:05.621
it’s kind of highlights
out of this travel album,

00:04:05.871 --> 00:04:09.381
and then of course people
can see their own image reflecting

00:04:09.541 --> 00:04:10.501
on certain spots,

00:04:11.126 --> 00:04:16.496
which is also nice because then you
create kind of a little conversation

00:04:16.663 --> 00:04:19.176
also with the viewers
or how they perceive the work.
