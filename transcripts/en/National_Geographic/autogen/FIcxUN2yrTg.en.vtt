so here we are at camp one at just under

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310
so here we are at camp one at just under
 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.789
so here we are at camp one at just under
20,000 feet and we're actually camp now

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799
20,000 feet and we're actually camp now
 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:06.980
20,000 feet and we're actually camp now
on the khumbu glacier and we're in the

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990
on the khumbu glacier and we're in the
 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.500
on the khumbu glacier and we're in the
Western combe or Valley we're surrounded

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510
Western combe or Valley we're surrounded
 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.110
Western combe or Valley we're surrounded
by the three peaks Everest load seat

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120

oopsy it's kind of a dead-ended valley

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889
oopsy it's kind of a dead-ended valley
 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.540
oopsy it's kind of a dead-ended valley
and this massive movement of ice is now

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550
and this massive movement of ice is now
 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.150
and this massive movement of ice is now
slowly moving down being pulled by

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160
slowly moving down being pulled by
 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.609
slowly moving down being pulled by
gravity and as it goes down over this

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619
gravity and as it goes down over this
 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.340
gravity and as it goes down over this
cliff down below us it creates the

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350
cliff down below us it creates the
 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.519
cliff down below us it creates the
Khumbu Icefall about 5am here we're

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529
Khumbu Icefall about 5am here we're
 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.769
Khumbu Icefall about 5am here we're
headed up to the Icefall stopped right

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779
headed up to the Icefall stopped right
 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.749

three or four feet per day over

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350
three or four feet per day over
 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.660
three or four feet per day over
difficult and steep bedrock and that's

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670
difficult and steep bedrock and that's
 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.119
difficult and steep bedrock and that's
what creates these crevasses and that's

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129
what creates these crevasses and that's
 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.639
what creates these crevasses and that's
what creates this chaos of ice blocks

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649
what creates this chaos of ice blocks
 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.070

called Cyrax and it's constantly moving

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080
called Cyrax and it's constantly moving
 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.630
called Cyrax and it's constantly moving
and that's why we want to move through

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640
and that's why we want to move through
 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.149
and that's why we want to move through
the ice ball very very quickly we're at

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159
the ice ball very very quickly we're at
 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.010
the ice ball very very quickly we're at
the top of the football field here just

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020
the top of the football field here just
 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.950
the top of the football field here just
took a quick break but some fairly large

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960
took a quick break but some fairly large
 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.750

so right ahead at the end of the valley

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360
so right ahead at the end of the valley
 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.510
so right ahead at the end of the valley
here we can see the peak load seat and

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520
here we can see the peak load seat and
 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.790
here we can see the peak load seat and
this is where the glacier begins you can

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800
this is where the glacier begins you can
 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.700
this is where the glacier begins you can
see a series of frozen waves as the

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710
see a series of frozen waves as the
 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.580
see a series of frozen waves as the
glacier now is slowly moving down the

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590
glacier now is slowly moving down the
 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.980
glacier now is slowly moving down the
valley and you can see the striations or

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990
valley and you can see the striations or
 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.430
valley and you can see the striations or
the layers of annual snowfall in the

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440
the layers of annual snowfall in the
 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.380
the layers of annual snowfall in the
sections of the racks that we can see

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390
sections of the racks that we can see
 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.480
sections of the racks that we can see
exposed we're going to spend one night

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490
exposed we're going to spend one night
 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.520
exposed we're going to spend one night
here at Camp one and tomorrow we're

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530
here at Camp one and tomorrow we're
 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.320
here at Camp one and tomorrow we're
going to get up early move to camp two

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330
going to get up early move to camp two
 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.880
going to get up early move to camp two
and hopefully spent two or three nights

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890
and hopefully spent two or three nights
 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.890
and hopefully spent two or three nights
there and it's really great to be out of

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900
there and it's really great to be out of
 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.950
there and it's really great to be out of
base camp that's for sure
