- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape:
bipedal, naked, large brain. Long the

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:38.610
master of fire, tools, and language, but
still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:48.590
Aware that death is inevitable, yet filled
with optimism. We grow up slowly. We hand

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:56.100
down knowledge. We empathize and deceive.
We shape the future from our shared

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:03.480
understanding of the past. CARTA brings
together experts from diverse disciplines

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:11.300

we got here. An exploration made possible

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.959

- [Mark] I would like to thank the
organizers. This is great opportunity to

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:11.160
come and listen to all these talks and
present some as well. So I would like to

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:18.390
start...so genes are really central and
they're central for a couple of reasons.

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.880
Well we can use lots of sources of
evidence to identify which are the genes

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.570
that are important in any process. Here,
we're talking about skin pigmentation so

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.180
we have molecular biology data, clinically
significant conditions generally

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:40.130
hypopigmentation, different types of
albinism, non-human animals especially the

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.830
mouse has really been influential in
helping us understand how genes affect

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:51.140
pigmentation. We can follow evolution in a
number of ways; molecular evolution as

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:58.000
well as just the evolution across
different populations. And finally,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.050
Admixture mapping. This is an approach to
find the genes that determine differences

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.790
between populations. When we have those
genes, we can then use them to design more

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.850
experiments to help us understand better
how they function. So knowing those genes

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:21.790
is really central. We can address
questions like where and when these new

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:28.440
gene mutations happen that give us
different skin color in this case,

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.390
potentially improved diagnostic and
treatments, test different kinds of

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:39.320
molecular hypotheses and finally predict
trait values. This could be useful in a

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.280
forensic context when the person's not
there, you don't have any information

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:50.440
about who he is, to make some predictions
as well as in Epidemiology. Skin is

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:56.670
mediating something about the disease
condition. We know it's really critical in

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.970
producing enough Vitamin D.
We can measure the skin from the DNA

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:08.490
alone, so not having measured it in the
person. So there's a lot of potential

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:15.060
there. Here's an example of a melanocyte
and keratinocytes, typically they reach up

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:20.950
to 30 or 40 keratinocytes and pass off
melanosomes. So it's just a little bit

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:26.400
about the biology. We know a lot about the
genes that are forming these melanosomes

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:32.340
and controlling their transfer up to the
keratinocytes. I've always been fascinated

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:39.600
by human variation and here's a slide of
18 young women who we collected recently

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:46.050
as part of our sampling. You can get
quickly a sense of the diversity of human

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:55.040
pigmentation; skin, hair, and eyes from
this. We can look at more detailed

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.820
descriptions, quantitative descriptions.
This is a histogram showing the

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:06.360
pigmentation levels measured in three
populations. The one on the far left is

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.840
European-American sample from State
College, the black bars to the right are

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:18.290
African-Americans from Washington DC, and
then a sample of African-Caribbeans from

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:24.110
England. The African-Caribbeans are
shifted over to the right a little bit

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:31.000
compared to the African-Americans and
that's darker skin. In fact they have less

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.410
European ancestry, less European admixture
than the African-Americans do; about 10%

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:43.300
compared to 20%. So there's a strong
relationship there between your recent

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:50.220
admixture and your skin color. We do see
too, this red bar here shows the extent of

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:57.920
overlap because this slide also emphasizes
how our observation of each other is

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.760
substantially biased.
Sociologists have studied this in detail

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:07.350
and light skinned people see dark skin
people as darker than they are. Dark

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:11.840
skinned people see light skinned people as
lighter than they are. So you can't really

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:18.100
rely on your perceptions or at least it's
worth looking inward to see what effect

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:25.570
that may have on how you see those around
you. We know the environment has been a

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:30.300
major factor in the evolution of skin
color. That green line there is the

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:37.460
equator and latitude or the distance north
and south of the equator have a major

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:43.460
effect on skin color. We know from more
detailed analyses that it's actually the

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:48.500
ultraviolet radiation at ground level that
really has the strongest effect on skin

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:55.240
color. So our skin is tied to the
environment and we can propose or discuss

00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:00.870
the different mechanisms that may be
controlling this response. I think the

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:07.470
strongest evidence is for lightning of
skin due to the need to produce Vitamin D.

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:14.610
A very few natural sources that we can
dietarily consume enough Vitamin D to keep

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:19.300
us healthy, but our skin can produce
Vitamin D. So with ultraviolet light

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:24.340
hitting your skin, you can produce Vitamin
D if your skin's light enough for that

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:29.270
environment and if you're exposed enough,
if you have enough skin showing and if you

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:36.130
spend enough time outdoors. So lots of
conditions on being healthy through

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:41.050
getting your Vitamin D from your skin.
Potentially immune suppression is also

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:47.220
something that is good in certain
instances. Darker skin probably evolved to

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:52.710
protect us from sunburn, skin cancer,
protect us from too much immune

00:07:52.710 --> 00:08:00.810
suppression and also perhaps to mediate
folic acid photolysis to protect our folic

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:05.290
acid stores from being destroyed.
Ultraviolet light helps to create Vitamin

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:12.960
D, but it also destroys folic acid.
Finally, both low and high pigmentation

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:18.310
can be mediated through sexual selection
and also the relaxation of selection as

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:24.650
population move from one area to another
area. We can talk about the average

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:32.660
history of individuals, persons and
populations. And this tree shows... I know

00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:38.580
it's kind of complex but that's really the
best representation that we can make of

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:44.420
our history. Although this is about 10
years old, I think it still holds in most

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:49.940
of the major branches here. And it's not
only a branching through the fission,

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:55.210
separation of populations, but also the
fusion of populations. You can see here

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:59.800
how we have drawn these little branches
here to illustrate admixture or the

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:06.130
movement of people to join other
populations. Our species really has much

00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:12.720
more of a wisteria vine history when
branches cross they fuse and they join

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:18.000
again making new populations as opposed to
any kind of tree or bush pattern. That is

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.630
an average pattern. Evolution really
doesn't happen...at least a lot of

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:29.730
evolution, the adaptive evolution, happens
more on a gene by gene basis. So it's

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:36.250
modular, each gene has its own history.
The genes that cause differences among us

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:40.760
today are genes that have very recent
evolutionary histories and have been very

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:49.430
actively evolving in the past 75,000
years, say, since human population had

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:55.180
their common origin in Africa. Many
populations stayed in Africa, some small

00:09:55.180 --> 00:10:00.600
set of populations moved out of Africa.
We have tools that let us study how

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:07.710
these...tracking the molecular evolution
of these genes and how quickly they

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:13.750
evolved showing clear evidence that they
have evolved recently or changed frequency

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:19.100
recently. So these are very valuable
tools. I'll show you an application of one

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:24.230
of those methods in a minute. But I want
to focus really on just three populations

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:28.860
to start with. These aren't the three most
important populations or three central

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:34.050
populations. That tree I showed you before
is really a better sampling of human

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:38.930
diversity, but these are worth looking at.
We were initially very light skinned

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:43.640
before we lost our fur, all mammals are.
You spread your cat's fur, even if it's a

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:48.920
black cat, you'll see the skin is white
underneath. As we lost our fur, changed

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:53.790
our habits, we needed to become dark
skinned. There's other branches here, the

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:59.840
second branch is a common branch to East
Asians and Europeans. The third branch

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:04.510
there would contain skin lightening events
that were specific to East Asians, the

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:10.710
fourth branch is the branch specific to
European changes. Finally, additional skin

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:15.050
darkening events possibly on that fifth
branch that I show in this tree. So I

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:20.560
mentioned admixture mapping before and
this is really a fundamental tool for

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:26.390
finding genes that cause differences
between populations. Most of the genes are

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:31.140
the same across all populations. If you
look at the frequencies of alleles across

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:37.620
populations, about 95% of the total
variation is in common. We have this very

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:42.760
recent common history, but for certain
things, especially superficial aspects,

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:48.920
superficial traits, we have evolved very
quickly and we can map those kinds of

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:53.910
genes with this approach. So we basically
start out with two parents; one light skin

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:58.600
and one dark skin. These are the
histograms describing their distributions.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:05.410
When they mate, you have the first admixed
generation and there is much less

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:10.250
variation in skin color here or whatever
trait it is that you're talking about.

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:16.200
Everybody has two copies, two genomes; one
from European ancestor and one from an

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:20.940
African ancestor in this case. But by the
second generation and all the generations

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:25.550
afterwards, you have a lot of variation. A
lot of phenotypic variation and these are

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:31.640
ideal samples for discovering which are
the genes that are affecting this trait.

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:37.800
Here it is as a chromosomal view. So you
have two European chromosomes, two African

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:42.490
chromosomes or one of each. You get one of
each by having one parent from each

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:48.240
population. These black bars are
recombination points so you don't pass on

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:52.230
to your kids the same chromosomes you got
from your parents. You mix them up and

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:59.100
then pass on this mixed up set of
chromosomes to your kids. And after a few

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:03.200
generations, you end up with these
chimeric chromosomes that have different

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:08.170
ancestry segments. We can track those
ancestry segments and use that information

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:15.940
to map genes. We do need to be careful
about stratification. So there's variation

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:21.740
in admixture levels across population.
This slide here shows you how the

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:26.400
proportion of West African ancestry is
positively correlated with the skin color

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:31.990
measure, the M index. You see a positive
correlation, you also see the variance is

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:36.270
different so there is a lot more
dispersion here, a lot more variability.

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:42.360
This is because like most traits, skin
color is much more variable in Africa.

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:47.050
Even just considering the subset of
Africa, West Africa where the enslaved

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:52.220
ancestors of the African-Americans and
Brazilians and other populations that are

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:58.080
represented here were derived. So even at
that subset of Africa is much more

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:02.370
variable than Europe.
But you have this confounding. So you have

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:08.270
to deal with the fact that ancestry is
going to be correlated with any...our skin

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:12.410
color will be correlated with any marker
that you measure that's different between

00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:17.960
those parental groups. But you can reduce
that, you can remove that statistically.

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:22.280
It's a process called conditioning or
controlling. You basically remove the

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:28.010
effects of one variable to study another.
This is the Duffy null locus, locus of

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:33.770
very substantially between populations and
you can see the genotype determines the

00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:38.990
distribution of skin color. It has nothing
to do with skin color. When you control

00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:46.050
for the variation and ancestry, you get
rid of that effect on skin color. This is

00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:53.560
the cover of the journal where we
published on the SLC24A5 gene. This gene

00:14:53.560 --> 00:15:00.690
was first discovered by Keith Cheng as the
golden gene for zebra fish. So it affected

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:05.030
zebra fish coloration. Keith called me up
and said, "Hey, maybe this affects skin

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:10.210
color." I was quite skeptical until I
looked at public data set where it showed

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:16.300
a locus where Europeans, the blue dot
here, were totally fixed for an allele.

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:22.960
You didn't find much in other populations.
That's a very unusual circumstance and

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:27.520
sure enough it has a very dramatic effect
on skin color. You can see that here even

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:32.900
after controlling for ancestry, you still
have a strong effect on skin color. And in

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:40.770
fact in genome-wide admixture mapping we
find SLC24A5 is really the strongest gene

00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:46.860
affecting skin color. You see these other
smaller peaks here. Once you condition for

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:52.710
the effect of SLC24A5, those genes are
much more prominent. So you can see that

00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:57.990
you can detect those. So this statistical
conditioning is a very common tool and

00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:02.690
very useful.
One of the interesting things we found

00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:08.010
about not only SLC24A5 but some of those
other genes that come up in this gene

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:15.670
mapping analysis like SLC45A2 or the MATP
gene is that the variation that causes

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:20.950
Europeans to be light skinned is not the
same as the variation that causes East

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:27.060
Asians to be light skinned. So this
selective pressure to lighten the skin

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:32.380
probably in response to migrating to
higher latitudes where there's less UV

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:37.870
light was quite strong. I mean it seems to
affect any population that moves to a

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:46.110
higher latitude. This is really kind of
unexpected. We had other hypotheses about

00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:51.140
populations like Melanesians maybe they
shared or didn't share genes with darker

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:58.680
skinned populations, but this is what we
found. And in fact, there are many genes,

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:03.760
I'm not going to talk to you about many of
these other genes, but I just wanted to

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:11.750
show you a slide that identified what
we're finding about where these genes

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:17.060
occur and on which branches they seem to
have evolved. So we're not finding too

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:22.360
many that are on this common branch of
lightning, in the common population coming

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:31.290
out of Africa and only a few that are back
as far as on the common branch of all

00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:35.810
human populations. But some of these are
more difficult to study, too. This is

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:40.860
probably the case. I don't think that
those genes don't exist and we can't

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:45.330
understand them, we just haven't been able
to find them yet. One very interesting

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:52.060
tool we have is to look at the local
genetic diversity. So this is using Short

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:58.740
Tandem Repeats or STRs. If you watch too
many crime TV shows, you probably already

00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:02.920
know this acronym.
But these are the markers you use for

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:08.350
identity analysis if you have a forensic
case you type the STR alleles. You can see

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:14.500
there's lots of different variants. This
is the chromosome here that doesn't have

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:19.060
the new allele, the A allele, that gives
you a lighter skin. This is the chromosome

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:23.500
with the lighter skin. So you can see
there is much less variation on that

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:27.860
chromosome even though it's basically
fixed in Europeans. So there's lots of

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:31.850
copies of that chromosome which usually
means it's old and you are going to see

00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:36.550
lots of different mutations on it. Lots of
different STR alleles, but you don't. You

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:41.930
only see pretty much one primary alleles
on most of these. So you can use that

00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:48.130
information to date when that mutation
occurred or when it started to change

00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:52.400
frequency. That's really the more
important point is when did that really

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:58.850
start to evolve. So the dates or the time
is here and the selective coefficient, how

00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:05.270
strong the selection was is there, and you
can put these on a tree then. So you can

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:14.530
look at when the timing of some of these
genes SLC24A5, MATP, and TRP1 changed

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:19.720
frequency compared to when KIT Ligand and
some of the other ones changed frequency.

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:25.840
And they seem to match those splits on the
tree. So I just want to say we're very

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:31.390
grateful to all of our volunteers who
participated in these research projects

00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:38.240
and I have lots of other colleagues who
have also helped in getting to this point

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:41.919
and then several other research labs as
well who are looking into a lot of these

00:19:41.919 --> 00:19:45.576
same questions. Thank you very much.
