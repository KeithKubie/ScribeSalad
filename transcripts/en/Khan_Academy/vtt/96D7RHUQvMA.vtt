00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
I think we're ready now to
tackle some more or even more

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.550
complicated examples.

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:06.650
So let's draw something
crazy here.

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.200
So let's see, let
me draw a chain.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.990
Let me draw it like that.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.680
And so like we've done in all
of the examples, you want to

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:18.890
find the longest chain.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:19.730
We could count from here.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.390
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, or maybe

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.350
it's one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:26.690
No.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.220
Or maybe it's one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven,

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.150
eight, nine, ten.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.840
That is our longest chain.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.940
Let me make that in green.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.480
So our longest chain
here is in green.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.910
So this decane-- sorry,
this backbone has

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.380
ten carbons in it.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.590
The prefix for ten is dec-.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.750
It is an alkane since it has
all single bonds, so we can

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.240
write decane for the backbone.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:02.210
And then it has a group right
here and this group consists

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.540
of one, two carbons attached
to the backbone.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.640
The prefix for two carbons
is eth-, so

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.420
this is an ethyl group.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.820
The -yl is because it's a group
attached to the main

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.510
alkane chain, so we call
this ethyldecane.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.640
But we have to specify where the
ethyl group is attached.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.090
And we want to give it as low of
a number as possible, so we

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.160
start counting on the
side closest to it.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.530
So it's one, two, three,
four, five, so this is

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.130
5-ethyldecane.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.210
Now let's complicate this
a little bit more.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.410
So let me just to copy
and paste this.

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.260
So I have pasted it there.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.810
And let me complicate this
molecule a little bit more.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.635
Let me add another ethyl
group to it.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.200
So let's say we have another
ethyl group over there.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.560
Now, what is this going to be?

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.370
Well, the longest chain is still
going to be that thing

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.840
in green, so it's still
going to be a decane.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.350
But now we have two ethyl
groups, one on the five

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.990
carbon, one, two, three,
four, five, and then

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.335
one on the six carbon.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.510
So we write here-- you might
be tempted to write

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.460
5-ethyl-6-ethyldecane, which
really wouldn't be wrong, but

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.220
it would just be maybe
more letters

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.180
than you want to write.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.820
Instead you write
5,6-diethyldecane.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.950
The 5,6- tells us the two
carbons on the main backbone

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.960
that the ethyl groups are
attached to, and the di- says

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.670
that we have two ethanes.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.950
Or two ethyl groups, I should
say, not ethane groups.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.250
Two ethyl groups, one over here
and one right over here.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.010
Now, let's make it even
more complex.

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.380
Let's take our thing and let's
make it even more complex.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:12.280
So let's copy it and let
us paste it, edit,

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.376
paste, just like that.

00:03:17.376 --> 00:03:18.280
Let's paste it.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.880
Let me make it a little
bit lower over here.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.170
So the exact same thing we just
dealt with, but let's add

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.810
one more group to it.

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.080
Let's say it looks something
like this.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.610
Let's say on that five carbon--
let's say on that six

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.620
carbon right there, I have
a group that looks

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:37.560
something like this.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.300
What is this is going
to be called?

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.040
And here we probably want to
break it down a little bit.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.080
We still have the backbone,
so it's still

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.330
going to be a decane.

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.530
But let's just do
it step by step.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.500
So we know that this right here,
this is an ethyl group.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.410
It's on the five carbon,
so that is a 5-ethyl.

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.340
This is another ethyl group
on the six carbon,

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.440
so that is a 6-ethyl.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.980
Now, we have this
group over here.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.030
So how many carbons
are on this group?

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.470
Well, we have one, two,
three carbons on it.

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.400
We have three carbons on it, so
we might want to just call

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.840
it a propyl group, but
notice something.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.959
We are attached to the carbon,
and then it later

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:17.930
branches off into two.

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.940
It actually immediately
branches off into two.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.330
So we could actually call this
either sec-propyl, so this

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:31.730
right here, we can either call
it sec-propyl, or because it

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.270
is connected away from the-- I
guess it's connected directly

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.060
to the branch the way a
propyl group works.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.910
You could connect it and it
immediately branches, because

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.180
you only have three carbons.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.490
So just to clarify things,
it's sec- because we're

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.670
attached to two carbons
right there.

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.880
But sec-propyl isn't what
people normally call it.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.130
They normally call
it isopropyl.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.820
And the iso- root comes from
anything of the form.

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.110
So if I have a group that looks
like this, this would be

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.360
isobutyl, because we have one,
two, three, four carbons, and

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.130
we are attached right here, so
this is where we would attach

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:10.030
to the main backbone.

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:16.670
If I have a group that
looks like this,

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:18.990
this would be isopentyl.

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.700
I have one, two, three,
four, five carbons.

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.590
I'm attached away
from the branch.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.190
But if we go one step closer,
so we're attached just like

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:28.550
this, we're attached
to the original

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.720
group, this is isopropyl.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.170
One, two, three carbons.

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:37.570
Let me write-- isopropyl,
isobutyl, isopentyl.

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:40.900
Notice what the isos-- the isos
are like Y's, I guess is

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.330
the best way of thinking of it,
and you're attached to the

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:43.150
base of the Y.

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.220
In this case, you're almost
attached to the base of a V,

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.630
but, hopefully, you
get the idea.

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.710
So the common name for this
group would be isopropyl, or

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.500
if we wanted to use the
systematic naming, we could

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.720
just start at one as being-- let
me do this in a good color

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.490
--as the carbon we are attached
to, and then we only

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.670
have two carbons right
over there.

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:04.260
So if we have two carbons,
we're dealing

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:05.510
with an ethyl group.

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:11.430
And then you could say that
you have a methyl group

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.165
attached to the first carbon, so
it would be 1-methylethyl.

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:23.210
So this could either be called
an isopropyl group, or a

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.520
1-methylethyl group.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.300
And in either case-- let me
put that in parentheses.

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.503
In either case, it's attached
to the six carbon.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.750
So the prefixes are going to
be on the six carbon on our

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:44.970
main-- we have a 1-methylethyl,
where the

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:47.430
methyl is attached to the first
carbon on the ethyl

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:53.710
chain, or we could call this a
6-isopropyl group attached to

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:55.370
the six carbon.

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:58.500
Now, when we decide how to write
it, how do we know--

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:59.720
we're going to have to
write essentially the

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.200
ethyl and the isopropyl.

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.100
We're going to have to
write all of that in

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.830
front of the decane.

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:07.920
How do we decide whether
to write the eth-

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.030
or the propyl- first?

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:11.010
Well, here you just do it
in alphabetical order.

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:12.220
And actually these
little prefixes

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:13.960
in front don't matter.

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.800
So you compare the P to the E.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.130
Eth-, E comes first in
alphabetical order, so this

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:22.155
would be 5,6-diethyl.

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:30.640
So even though D-- well, D comes
even before E, but you

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:31.970
don't even count that prefix.

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:33.730
The E is what matters.

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:38.610
Diethyl, and then
we could say,

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:39.860
diethyl-6-isopropyldecane.

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:50.140
This is the common name:
6-isopropyldecane.

00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:59.150
This would be the common
name for it.

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:01.000
If we want to use the systematic
name, we would

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.970
replace the 6-isopropyl
with 6,1-methylethyl.

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:06.170
So let me write that down.

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:09.250
So let me just copy this part.

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:13.870
So copy and paste right there.

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:17.500
And then I can copy and
paste this right here.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.340
Copy and paste.

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:21.590
So it becomes
5,6-diethyl-6-1-methylethyl.

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:26.120
I know it's very confusing when
you see it, but when you

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.780
break it down, you really
could-- you would be able to

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:29.220
draw this from the structure.

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:38.320
And then finally you finish
with a decane.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.940
So hopefully, these examples
don't confuse you too much.

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:43.400
In the next few videos, we'll
do more and more examples.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.050
Because I think with the
nomenclature on the organic

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:47.960
chemistry, the more examples
you see, the better.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.260
This is really core, so in the
future you don't get confused

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.130
when people throw out
something like,

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:53.380
5,6-diethyl-6-(1
-methylethyl)decane.
