STEVE BAZYL: Yeah, so when you
pop open the API console, and

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:04.590
you're on--

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:53.694
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.860
STEVE BAZYL: Hi, everyone.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.020
And welcome to this week's
Google Developers Live for

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.970
Google Drive.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.490
And today we are joined by our
special guest, Gus Class, from

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.350
the Google+ team.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.940
GUS CLASS: Thanks for
having me here.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.110
STEVE BAZYL: Today we're going
to talk about how to use the

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.380
Google+ Sign-In button
with Google Drive.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.100
And Gus, for those who aren't
familiar with what you've been

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.800
doing on Google+, maybe you
could give a little bit of

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.140
background as to what the Plus
login button does and why

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.910
people should be using it.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:32.390
GUS CLASS: Absolutely.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.640
So we introduced to the Plus
login button, so the Sign-In

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.790
with Google+ button,
in February.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.670
And what it allows you to do
is it allows you to very

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.890
easily authorize a JavaScript
client as well as a

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.220
server-side client.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.080
And when you do this, you
get a lot of benefits.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.840
The most notable ones
are over-the-air

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.020
installs for Android.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.890
But you also get the capability
to do things with

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.500
Google+ and to get information
about your users.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.420
So when you do this, you can do
things like get a list of

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.699
the people who your user has
made available to your app.

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:11.270
And when you do this, you have
information about those

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.160
connections between people.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.310
And once you have those
connections between people,

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.910
you can allow them to engage
with each other within your

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:18.720
apps and services.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.170
And this creates a better
experience for the user, and

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.260
it also can drive up engagement
on your site and

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.610
can allow you to have certain
things like viral growth.

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.200
STEVE BAZYL: Yeah, so I've seen
two applications so far

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.680
that use the Google+ login in
conjunction with Drive.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.510
One of them we reviewed
a few weeks ago.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:35.420
It's Magisto.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.660
They have a really great
integration where you go to

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.050
the website, and you can
sign in with Plus.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.120
During the login, it asks for
permission to Drive and does

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.730
the over-the-air install of the
mobile app, which Carrie

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.010
reviewed a few weeks ago.

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.130
And it was a really awesome
experience.

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.750
There's another one, which is
Carrie is going to review

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.350
later today, Jolicloud, which
also has some really

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.520
interesting integration with
Plus and Drive as well.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.430
GUS CLASS: Yeah, Jolicloud, we
actually talked a little bit

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.500
about in our I/O presentation
where we showed off a couple

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.970
of the great things that
Jolicloud is doing when

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.800
they're using the
Google+ Sign-In.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.230
STEVE BAZYL: Yeah, and we'll
see a little bit of that as

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.890
Carrie does the demos.

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.270
So one of the questions that
comes up with the integration

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.680
with Plus and Drive is how the
two sharing models relate.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.460
And today, they are separate
models, but what are your

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.250
thoughts on when people should
do things like sharing via

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.790
Drive for certain types of
content versus doing things

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.630
like interactive posts and
sharing with a broader

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:33.670
community on Plus?

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:34.630
GUS CLASS: Yeah, absolutely.

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.950
So this is the notion
of private sharing

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.240
versus public sharing.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.380
And the other things about
sharing, such as active

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.490
sharing versus passive sharing,
come into play.

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.940
So for Google+, we have two
types of sharing that are

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.000
relevant for developers.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.760
And the first type is going
to be passive sharing.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.130
And so these are things
that your app is

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:55.190
going to write to Google.

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.860
And Google has begun
to use these--

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.557
we refer to them as app
activities-- we use these app

00:04:01.557 --> 00:04:05.340
activities to give better
relevance to the content that

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.730
your site is creating and the
type of content that users are

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:11.830
creating with your site.

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:17.089
And so that sharing model is
very independent of the kinds

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:18.790
of things that you would
do inside of Drive.

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.230
And then the other type of
sharing is active sharing.

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:25.190
So with active sharing, this
is done using the share

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.310
dialogue and interactive
posts.

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.450
So when you do these active
shares, you can do things like

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.520
you can pre-populate a form with
users from that user's

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.730
circles, and then those users
would receive notifications

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:38.890
across Google.

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.910
And when you do this, you create
really engaging shares.

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.810
And then that user can be
brought into your content

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.370
directly from the
Google+ stream.

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.660
So with Drive, there's the
shares that you perform on

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.840
Drive, and these are making
things available to users.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.430
When you share actively on
Google+ using an interactive

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.610
post, Google+ has a proxy that
needs to be able to access

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:03.330
that content.

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.360
So within Google Drive, this
is restricted just to those

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.520
public shares.

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.550
I believe you said
something about

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.770
there's a tier for sharing.

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.370
So there's the things that you
create that are just for you,

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.720
and then there's the things that
you create that are at a

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.620
much more refined point.

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:20.910
STEVE BAZYL: Yeah, and I think
when we were talking about

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.680
this the other day, one of the
examples that we came up with

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.280
is something like maybe a
scrapbooking application where

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.130
I may want to keep my
raw materials--

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:32.510
my photos, my clip art--

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:37.030
in Drive, maybe invite some
family members to work on that

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.420
in a very limited context.

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.160
But then when I want to start
expanding out to my broader

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:47.460
family and friends, then doing
a public share or a limited

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.630
share on Google+, making it
interactive, you can have a

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.540
very engaging experience with
the finished content.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.310
GUS CLASS: Yeah, so for in
that scrapbook example,

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.760
there's that, I'm creating
a raw materials

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:59.930
that are for my scrapbook.

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.530
And then, now I'm looking
for collaborators.

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:04.920
And so then using an interactive
post, you can draw

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.190
on those collaborators.

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:10.090
And then at the end of day,
you can use those files to

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:13.220
share directly from Google
Drive into Google+.

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:13.580
STEVE BAZYL: Right.

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.490
And you could always use the
Drive API to expand the ACLs

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:20.390
for a particular file to
match your sharing

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:23.170
via Google+ as well.

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:27.820
So are there any particular tips
or advice for using it?

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:31.210
I actually tried to do this
myself, and actually it was

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:33.310
really easy to use the
Google+ login.

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:36.130
I had actually modified our
quick-start for iOS.

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:38.860
And there are a few technical
issues that run into trying to

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.490
combine the two, but they're
pretty easy to work around.

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:44.400
And we'll share some of those
details on the community or

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.240
maybe a blog post.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.650
But other than that, are there
specific best practices?

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:52.650
GUS CLASS: Yeah, there's a whole
lot of best practices,

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:56.780
and we're going to try to get
deep into those inside of a

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:59.430
GDL series that we're working
on right now.

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:03.900
But at a high level, the big
things that you can do right

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.770
now are going to be when you
use the sign in scope, take

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:07.890
advantage of that user's data.

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:10.320
So reflect the user's profile
back to them.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:13.960
Show them their picture, and
let them know that their

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:18.350
friends are there and that
you're going to use their

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:20.620
social data to make a better
experience for them.

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:25.370
And connect users within your
site using those people that

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:27.150
the users made available
to you.

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:31.110
And most importantly, just
don't surprise the user.

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:34.390
Give them an experience so
that they know how you're

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:38.840
using their data, and make
sure that you follow the

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:43.900
requirements that we have for
Google+ Sign-In integrations.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:44.970
STEVE BAZYL: That's
great information.

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:46.360
And actually, Carrie's going
to show us some of this in

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.580
practice with a demonstration
of Jolicloud in

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:51.498
our app of the week.

00:07:51.498 --> 00:07:54.432
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:54.432 --> 00:07:55.670
MALE SPEAKER: App of the Week.

00:07:55.670 --> 00:08:02.105
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:02.105 --> 00:08:03.030
CARRIE ROWE: Hi, everybody.

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:03.910
I am Carrie.

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:06.890
And I'm really excited to demo
Jolicloud for you guys today.

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:10.110
This is a great integration
between Google+ and Drive, so

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:12.040
let's see how it works.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:16.360
So right here, you can see I
can sign in with Google+.

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.860
And what's really great, the
next window, it allows me to

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:22.560
add in any other products
that I want.

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:25.060
And so Jolicloud is an online
content management

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:25.970
system in the cloud.

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:28.690
So everybody has YouTube
videos they like, their

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:31.980
Google+ account, Facebook,
Drive, Picasa.

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:34.150
You have all these different
places on the internet where

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:36.429
you have content, and Jolicloud
allows you to access

00:08:36.429 --> 00:08:38.559
everything in one place.

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:39.730
And better yet, it allows
you to give

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:41.539
permission all in one place.

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:44.370
So I want to add Google Drive
into my Jolicloud.

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:48.630
And then when I click Sign in
with Google, you'll see on the

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:51.700
next page it's prompting me
for permission to access

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:53.240
everything in Google Drive.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:57.110
So I'm going to accept this.

00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:59.160
GUS CLASS: Actually, I'll jump
in here and say that the

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:03.220
really interesting thing that
Jolicloud is doing here is

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:07.480
they're dynamically creating
that scopes, the scopes that

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.950
they are adding to the Sign-In
button, before they render it.

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:12.020
And when they do this, it
doesn't surprise the user,

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:15.760
because the user says, oh, I
said that I want to give

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.460
Jolicloud access to
my Google Drive.

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:21.000
And so when they do this, it
creates a great experience for

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.400
the user, and it also will draw
more users to actually

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.020
click all the way through and
sign up and sign in with

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:33.200
Google+, which is really the
ultimate goal that you have

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.830
when performing these sign
in integrations.

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:36.440
CARRIE ROWE: Yeah, thanks.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:39.290
So it's a really, really great
example of how you can use

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:41.090
Google Drive and Google+
together.

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:43.340
And so you see now, now that
they've given permission, I've

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:45.140
signed in to Jolicloud.

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:47.890
Right here on my browser, I can
see that Google Drive and

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:50.360
Google+ are both
loaded already.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.980
And, let's see, on my Google+
page, you can see I'm a huge

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:57.890
fan of animals, especially
baby animals.

00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:00.590
And then all of my Drive stuff,
the folders are right

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:02.290
here, ready for me, waiting.

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:04.920
And I can use all
of my documents.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:07.270
So this is a really
great integration.

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:10.440
Definitely check it out if you
have a lot of online content

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.160
like most people do.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.230
And we love to see what
everybody's building, and

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:18.750
thanks for sharing the
extra insight.

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:20.980
So that's it for
our GDL today.

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:22.810
I wanted to thank the
Gus for coming on.

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:25.220
If you're interested in learning
more about Google+,

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:27.320
they do their GDLs
today as well.

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:31.000
They will be on-air today at
2:30 talking about what's new

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:31.540
with Hangouts.

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:33.250
So definitely check that out.

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:36.440
And next week we'll be back
with our Drive GDL to talk

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:37.320
about DocuSign.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.700
They're one of our
largest partners.

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:41.110
We're really excited to host
them, so definitely come back

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:42.190
next week and check that out.

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:44.280
So thanks, guys, very
much, and we'll see

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.370
everybody next week.

00:10:46.370 --> 00:11:56.148
