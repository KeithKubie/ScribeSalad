00:00:00.265 --> 00:00:01.345
- [Voiceover] What I
want to do in this video

00:00:01.345 --> 00:00:03.504
is explain what a mortgage is.

00:00:03.504 --> 00:00:05.443
I think most of us have at
least a general sense of it,

00:00:05.443 --> 00:00:07.962
but even better than that,
actually go into the numbers

00:00:07.962 --> 00:00:11.445
and understand a little bit
of what you are actually doing

00:00:11.445 --> 00:00:13.639
when you're paying a
mortgage, what it's made up of

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:15.218
and how much of it is interest

00:00:15.218 --> 00:00:18.327
versus how much of it is
actually paying down the loan.

00:00:18.422 --> 00:00:20.164
Let's just start with a little example.

00:00:20.164 --> 00:00:23.180
Let's say that there
is a house that I like.

00:00:24.041 --> 00:00:26.026
Let's say that that is the house

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:28.427
that I would like to purchase.

00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:31.738
It has a price tag of, let's say that

00:00:31.738 --> 00:00:36.346
I need to pay $500,000 to buy that house.

00:00:36.346 --> 00:00:39.480
This is the seller of
the house right here.

00:00:39.981 --> 00:00:41.838
And they have a mustache.

00:00:41.838 --> 00:00:43.742
That's the seller of the house.

00:00:43.742 --> 00:00:45.680
I would like to buy it.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.544
I would like to buy the
house. This is me right here.

00:00:50.277 --> 00:00:54.003
And I've been able to
save up $125,000 dollars.

00:00:54.585 --> 00:00:57.846
I've been able to save up
$125,000 but I would really like

00:00:57.846 --> 00:00:59.946
to live in that house so I go to a bank.

00:01:00.006 --> 00:01:04.641
I go to a bank, let me get
a good color for a bank.

00:01:04.641 --> 00:01:06.927
That is the bank right there.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.947
And I say, "Mr. Bank, can you lend me

00:01:09.947 --> 00:01:12.687
"the rest of the amount
I need for that house?"

00:01:12.687 --> 00:01:15.345
Which is essentially $375,000.

00:01:15.345 --> 00:01:19.002
I'm putting 25% down.
This number right here,

00:01:19.002 --> 00:01:24.002
that is 25% of $500,000.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.582
So I ask the bank, "Can I
have a loan for the balance?

00:01:27.582 --> 00:01:30.343
Can I have $375,000 loan?"

00:01:30.588 --> 00:01:34.907
And the bank says, "Sure.
You seem like a nice guy

00:01:34.907 --> 00:01:37.484
"with a good job who
has good credit rating.

00:01:37.484 --> 00:01:40.270
"I will give you the loan but while you're

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.730
paying off the loan you can't
have the title of that house.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.832
"We have to have that title of the house

00:01:45.832 --> 00:01:47.712
"and once you pay off the loan,

00:01:47.712 --> 00:01:50.359
"we're going to give you
the title of the house."

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:55.359
What's gonna happen here is
the loan is gonna go to me,

00:01:55.932 --> 00:01:59.192
so it's $375,000.

00:01:59.995 --> 00:02:03.093
$375,000 loan.

00:02:03.211 --> 00:02:05.949
Then I can go and buy the house.

00:02:06.055 --> 00:02:09.292
I'm gonna give the total $500,000,

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:12.928
$500,000 to the seller of the house,

00:02:12.928 --> 00:02:15.597
and I'll actually move
into the house myself,

00:02:15.597 --> 00:02:17.977
assuming I'm using it
for my own residence.

00:02:17.977 --> 00:02:20.787
But the title of the house, the document

00:02:20.787 --> 00:02:23.909
that says who actually owns the house.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.416
This is the home title.

00:02:27.591 --> 00:02:29.669
This is the title of the house.

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:32.917
Home title.

00:02:33.511 --> 00:02:37.910
It will not go to me.
It will go to the bank.

00:02:38.015 --> 00:02:39.954
The home title will go from the seller,

00:02:39.954 --> 00:02:41.348
or maybe even the seller's bank,

00:02:41.348 --> 00:02:43.194
because maybe they haven't
paid off their mortgage.

00:02:43.194 --> 00:02:46.837
It will go to the bank
that I'm borrowing from.

00:02:47.036 --> 00:02:50.693
This transferring of the
title to secure a loan.

00:02:50.693 --> 00:02:53.096
When I say "secure a
loan," I'm saying I need to

00:02:53.096 --> 00:02:55.349
give something to the
lender in case I don't

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.692
pay back the loan or if I just disappear.

00:02:57.833 --> 00:03:00.107
This is the security right here.

00:03:00.271 --> 00:03:03.693
That is technically what a mortgage is.

00:03:04.694 --> 00:03:09.694
This pledging of the title
as the security for the loan,

00:03:10.545 --> 00:03:13.354
that's what a mortgage is.

00:03:13.354 --> 00:03:15.595
It actually comes from old French.

00:03:15.595 --> 00:03:20.595
Mort means dead, and
the gage means pledge.

00:03:21.226 --> 00:03:24.372
I'm 100% sure I'm mispronouncing it,

00:03:24.372 --> 00:03:25.870
but it comes from dead pledge

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.714
because I'm pledging it
now but that pledge will

00:03:28.714 --> 00:03:31.813
eventually die once I pay off the loan.

00:03:31.813 --> 00:03:35.030
Once I pay off the loan this
pledge of the title to the bank

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.491
will die and it will come back to me.

00:03:37.491 --> 00:03:41.043
That's why it's called a
dead pledge, or a mortgage.

00:03:41.043 --> 00:03:43.132
And probably because it
comes from old French

00:03:43.132 --> 00:03:46.686
is the reason we don't say
mort-gage, we say mortgage.

00:03:46.686 --> 00:03:48.485
But anyway, this is a
little bit technical,

00:03:48.485 --> 00:03:50.830
but normally when people
refer to a mortgage

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.000
they're really referring
to the loan itself.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
They're really referring
to the mortgage loan.

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.174
What I want to do in
the rest of this video

00:04:01.174 --> 00:04:04.238
is use a screenshot from
a spreadsheet I made

00:04:04.238 --> 00:04:06.758
to actually show you the math,

00:04:06.758 --> 00:04:10.239
or actually show you what your
mortgage payment is going to.

00:04:10.311 --> 00:04:15.311
You can download this
spreadsheet at khanacademy,

00:04:16.173 --> 00:04:21.173
khanacademy.org/downloads/mortgagecalculator

00:04:31.257 --> 00:04:36.188
Or actually, even better, just
go to the downloads folder

00:04:36.188 --> 00:04:38.522
and on your web browser
you'll see a bunch of files,

00:04:38.522 --> 00:04:41.654
and it will be the file
called MortgageCalculator,

00:04:42.724 --> 00:04:47.724
MortgageCalculator.xlsx.

00:04:51.454 --> 00:04:53.532
It's a Microsoft 2007 format.

00:04:53.532 --> 00:04:56.470
Just go to this URL, then
you'll see all the files there

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.049
and you can just download this file

00:04:58.049 --> 00:04:59.407
if you want to play with it.

00:04:59.407 --> 00:05:02.449
What it does here, in this
kind of dark brown color,

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:04.225
these are the assumptions
that you can input

00:05:04.225 --> 00:05:06.930
and then you can change these
cells in your spreadsheet

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.414
without breaking the whole spreadsheet.

00:05:09.414 --> 00:05:12.768
Here I've assumed a 5.5% interest rate.

00:05:12.769 --> 00:05:17.330
I'm buying a $500,000 home.

00:05:17.448 --> 00:05:19.468
It's a 25% down payment,

00:05:19.468 --> 00:05:23.669
that's the $125,000 that I had saved up,

00:05:23.937 --> 00:05:27.256
that I talked about right over there.

00:05:27.688 --> 00:05:29.196
And then the loan amount.

00:05:29.196 --> 00:05:31.715
Well, I have 125, I'm
gonna have to borrow 375,

00:05:31.715 --> 00:05:33.376
it calculates it for us.

00:05:33.376 --> 00:05:35.674
And then I'm gonna get a
pretty plain vanilla loan.

00:05:35.674 --> 00:05:37.612
This is gonna be a 30 year.

00:05:37.636 --> 00:05:40.528
When I say term in years, this
is how long the loan is for.

00:05:40.528 --> 00:05:42.348
So 30 years.

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:45.471
It's gonna be a 30 year
fixed-rate mortgage.

00:05:45.531 --> 00:05:49.792
Fixed rate, which means the
interest rate won't change.

00:05:49.792 --> 00:05:50.836
We'll talk about that a little bit.

00:05:50.836 --> 00:05:55.330
This 5.5% that I'm paying
on the money that I borrowed

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.034
will not change over the
course of the 30 years.

00:05:58.034 --> 00:05:59.788
We will see that the amount I've borrowed

00:05:59.788 --> 00:06:02.933
changes as I pay down some of the loan.

00:06:02.933 --> 00:06:04.710
This little tax rate that I have here,

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.310
this is to actually figure
out what is the tax savings

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.888
of the interest deduction on my loan.

00:06:09.888 --> 00:06:10.933
We'll talk about that in a second,

00:06:10.933 --> 00:06:12.128
you can ignore it for now.

00:06:12.128 --> 00:06:13.753
Then these other things
that aren't in brown,

00:06:13.753 --> 00:06:15.147
you shouldn't mess with these if you

00:06:15.147 --> 00:06:17.051
actually do open up the
spreadsheet yourself.

00:06:17.051 --> 00:06:19.150
These are automatically calculated.

00:06:19.453 --> 00:06:21.346
This right here is a
monthly interest rate.

00:06:21.346 --> 00:06:25.314
So it's literally the
annual interest rate, 5.5%,

00:06:25.374 --> 00:06:26.652
divided by 12.

00:06:26.652 --> 00:06:30.251
And most mortgage loans are
compounded on a monthly basis

00:06:30.251 --> 00:06:33.246
so at the end of every month
they see how much money you owe

00:06:33.246 --> 00:06:34.929
and they will charge you

00:06:34.929 --> 00:06:37.205
this much interest on that for the month.

00:06:37.205 --> 00:06:38.574
Now given all of these assumptions,

00:06:38.574 --> 00:06:40.908
there's a little bit of
behind-the-scenes math,

00:06:40.908 --> 00:06:42.371
and in a future video I
might actually show you

00:06:42.371 --> 00:06:45.668
how to calculate what the
actual mortgage payment is.

00:06:45.668 --> 00:06:47.871
It's actually a pretty
interesting problem.

00:06:47.885 --> 00:06:51.031
But for a $500,000 loan--
Well, a $500,000 house,

00:06:51.031 --> 00:06:56.031
a $375,000 loan over 30 years
at a 5.5% interest rate,

00:06:56.952 --> 00:07:01.952
my mortgage payment is
going to be roughly $2,100.

00:07:03.488 --> 00:07:05.171
Right when I bought the house,

00:07:05.171 --> 00:07:07.273
I want to introduce a
little bit of vocabulary,

00:07:07.273 --> 00:07:09.792
and we've talked about this
in some of the other videos.

00:07:09.792 --> 00:07:13.552
There's a asset in question
right here, it's called a house.

00:07:14.134 --> 00:07:16.999
And we're assuming it's worth $500,000.

00:07:17.814 --> 00:07:21.655
We're assuming it's worth
$500,000. That is an asset.

00:07:22.296 --> 00:07:23.991
It's an asset because it
gives you future benefit;

00:07:23.991 --> 00:07:26.357
The future benefit of
being able to live in it.

00:07:26.452 --> 00:07:28.751
Now there's a liability
against that asset,

00:07:28.751 --> 00:07:30.829
that's the mortgage loan.

00:07:30.829 --> 00:07:33.973
That's a $375,000 liability.

00:07:34.532 --> 00:07:38.779
$375,000 loan or debt.

00:07:39.675 --> 00:07:41.938
If this was your balance sheet,

00:07:41.938 --> 00:07:45.015
if this was all of your assets
and this is all of your debt,

00:07:45.015 --> 00:07:47.093
and you were essentially
to sell the assets

00:07:47.093 --> 00:07:48.452
and pay off the debt,

00:07:48.452 --> 00:07:49.833
if you sell the house you get the title,

00:07:49.833 --> 00:07:52.293
you can get the money, then
you pay it back to the bank.

00:07:52.352 --> 00:07:54.616
Well actually, it doesn't
necessarily go into that order

00:07:54.616 --> 00:07:55.916
but I won't get too technical.

00:07:55.916 --> 00:07:57.936
But if you were to unwind
this transaction immediately

00:07:57.936 --> 00:08:01.837
after doing it, then you
would have a $500,000 house,

00:08:01.837 --> 00:08:04.252
you'd pay off your $375,000 in debt,

00:08:04.252 --> 00:08:09.252
and you would get, in
your pocket, $125,000,

00:08:10.649 --> 00:08:12.913
which is exactly what your
original down payment was.

00:08:12.913 --> 00:08:14.991
But this is your equity.

00:08:14.991 --> 00:08:17.591
The reason why I'm pointing it out now is,

00:08:17.591 --> 00:08:19.449
in this video I'm not
gonna assume anything

00:08:19.449 --> 00:08:21.713
about the house price,
whether it goes up or down,

00:08:21.713 --> 00:08:23.152
we're assuming it's constant.

00:08:23.152 --> 00:08:24.696
But you could not assume it's constant

00:08:24.696 --> 00:08:26.575
and play with the
spreadsheet a little bit.

00:08:26.647 --> 00:08:30.791
But I'm introducing this
because as we pay down the debt

00:08:30.791 --> 00:08:32.649
this number's going to get smaller.

00:08:32.649 --> 00:08:34.436
So this number is getting smaller.

00:08:34.436 --> 00:08:36.689
Let's say at some point
this is only 300,000.

00:08:36.689 --> 00:08:38.709
Then my equity is going to get bigger.

00:08:38.709 --> 00:08:41.936
So you could do equity is
how much value you have

00:08:41.936 --> 00:08:44.479
after you pay off the debt for your house.

00:08:44.479 --> 00:08:45.895
If you were to sell the
house, pay off the debt,

00:08:45.895 --> 00:08:48.788
what do you have left over for yourself.

00:08:50.142 --> 00:08:54.275
This is the real wealth in the
house, this is what you own.

00:08:54.625 --> 00:08:57.945
Wealth in house, or the
actual what the owner has.

00:08:57.945 --> 00:09:00.997
What I've done here is--

00:09:01.196 --> 00:09:02.543
Actually before I get to
the chart let me actually

00:09:02.543 --> 00:09:04.944
show you how I calculate the chart.

00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:07.777
I do this over the course of
30 years, and it goes by month.

00:09:07.779 --> 00:09:09.218
So you can imagine that there's actually

00:09:09.218 --> 00:09:11.505
360 rows here in the actual spreadsheet,

00:09:11.505 --> 00:09:13.883
and you'll see that if
you go and open it up.

00:09:14.024 --> 00:09:15.824
But I just want to show you what I did.

00:09:16.208 --> 00:09:21.208
On month 0, which I don't show
here, you borrow $375,000.

00:09:21.896 --> 00:09:23.579
Now, over the course of that month

00:09:23.579 --> 00:09:26.702
they're going to charge you .46% interest.

00:09:26.702 --> 00:09:30.021
Remember, that was 5.5% divided by 12.

00:09:30.197 --> 00:09:35.197
.46% interest on $375,000 is $1,718.75.

00:09:38.741 --> 00:09:40.784
So I haven't made any
mortgage payments yet.

00:09:40.784 --> 00:09:43.245
I've borrowed 375,000.

00:09:43.245 --> 00:09:47.030
This much interest essentially
got built up on top of that,

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:48.609
it got accrued.

00:09:48.609 --> 00:09:50.873
So now before I've paid
any of my payments,

00:09:50.873 --> 00:09:53.798
instead of owing 375,000 at
the end of the first month,

00:09:53.798 --> 00:09:58.394
I owe $376,718.

00:09:58.814 --> 00:10:02.296
Now, I'm a good guy, I'm not
gonna default on my mortgage

00:10:02.296 --> 00:10:04.410
so I make that first mortgage payment that

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:08.274
we calculated right over here.

00:10:09.111 --> 00:10:12.036
After I make that payment
then I'm essentially,

00:10:12.036 --> 00:10:14.914
what's my loan balance
after making that payment?

00:10:15.323 --> 00:10:17.041
Well, this was before making the payment,

00:10:17.041 --> 00:10:18.747
so you subtract the payment from it.

00:10:18.747 --> 00:10:21.206
This is my loan balance after the payment.

00:10:21.441 --> 00:10:24.318
Now this right here, the
little asterisk here,

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:25.841
this is my equity now.

00:10:25.841 --> 00:10:29.265
So remember, I started
with $125,000 of equity.

00:10:29.265 --> 00:10:33.062
After paying one loan balance,
after my first payment,

00:10:33.062 --> 00:10:38.062
I now have $125,410 in equity,

00:10:38.379 --> 00:10:42.220
so my equity has gone up by exactly $410.

00:10:42.825 --> 00:10:45.506
Now you're probably saying,
"Gee. I made a $2,000 payment,

00:10:45.506 --> 00:10:48.003
"roughly a $2,000 payment,

00:10:48.003 --> 00:10:51.138
"and my equity only went up by $410

00:10:51.138 --> 00:10:54.121
"Shouldn't this debt
have gone down by $2,000

00:10:54.121 --> 00:10:56.522
"and my equity have gone up by $2,000?"

00:10:56.606 --> 00:10:58.103
And the answer is no because you

00:10:58.103 --> 00:10:59.866
had to pay all of this interest.

00:11:00.898 --> 00:11:03.257
So at the very beginning, your payment,

00:11:03.257 --> 00:11:07.237
your $2,000 payment, is mostly interest.

00:11:07.391 --> 00:11:11.150
Only $410 of it is principal.

00:11:12.582 --> 00:11:15.123
So as your loan balance goes down

00:11:15.123 --> 00:11:17.142
you're going to pay less interest here,

00:11:17.142 --> 00:11:18.919
so each of your payments are going to be

00:11:18.919 --> 00:11:20.602
more weighted towards principal,

00:11:20.602 --> 00:11:22.680
and less weighted towards interest.

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.178
And then to figure out the next line,

00:11:24.178 --> 00:11:25.838
this interest accrued right here,

00:11:25.838 --> 00:11:29.925
I took your loan balance
exiting the last month,

00:11:29.925 --> 00:11:33.151
multiplied that times .46%.

00:11:33.151 --> 00:11:35.149
You get this new interest accrued.

00:11:35.149 --> 00:11:36.786
This is your new pre-payment balance.

00:11:36.786 --> 00:11:40.106
I pay my mortgage again.
This is my new loan balance.

00:11:40.106 --> 00:11:44.703
And notice, already by month
two, $2 more went to principal.

00:11:44.703 --> 00:11:46.932
and $2 less went to interest.

00:11:46.932 --> 00:11:49.278
And over the course of 360
months you're going to see that

00:11:49.278 --> 00:11:51.251
it's an actual, sizable difference,

00:11:51.251 --> 00:11:53.455
and that's what this
chart shows us right here.

00:11:53.921 --> 00:11:55.778
This is the interest
and principal portions

00:11:55.778 --> 00:11:57.078
of our mortgage payment.

00:11:57.078 --> 00:12:00.318
So this entire height
right here, this is--

00:12:00.318 --> 00:12:02.013
Let me scroll down a little bit.

00:12:02.013 --> 00:12:04.358
This is by month. So this
entire height, you notice,

00:12:04.358 --> 00:12:09.358
this is exactly our mortgage
payment, this $2,129.

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:15.650
Now, on that very first month
you saw that of my $2,100,

00:12:16.235 --> 00:12:20.379
only $400 of it, this is the $400.

00:12:20.379 --> 00:12:24.756
Only $400 of it went to
actually pay down the principal,

00:12:24.756 --> 00:12:26.717
the actual loan amount.

00:12:26.717 --> 00:12:29.255
The rest of it went to pay down interest,

00:12:29.994 --> 00:12:31.975
the interest for that month.

00:12:32.116 --> 00:12:33.800
Most of it went for the
interest of the month.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.901
But as I start paying down the loan,

00:12:35.901 --> 00:12:37.480
as the loan balance gets
smaller and smaller,

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:40.822
each of my payments, there's
less interest to pay.

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:42.959
Let me do a better color than that.

00:12:42.959 --> 00:12:46.860
There's less interest. We go
out here, this is month 198,

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:49.716
over there that last month
there was less interest,

00:12:49.716 --> 00:12:54.716
so more of my $2,100 actually
goes to pay off the loan

00:12:56.036 --> 00:12:58.438
until we get all the way to month 360.

00:12:58.438 --> 00:13:00.215
You can see this in
the actual spreadsheet.

00:13:00.215 --> 00:13:02.536
At month 360 my final payment

00:13:02.536 --> 00:13:04.708
is all going to pay off the principal.

00:13:04.708 --> 00:13:07.018
Very little, if anything,
of that is interest.

00:13:07.018 --> 00:13:09.758
Now, the last thing I want
to talk about in this video,

00:13:09.758 --> 00:13:11.488
without making it too long,

00:13:11.488 --> 00:13:14.170
is this idea of a interest tax deduction.

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:16.317
A lot of times you'll hear
financial planners or realtors

00:13:16.317 --> 00:13:19.127
tell you the benefit of buying your house

00:13:19.127 --> 00:13:22.076
is it has tax advantages, and it does.

00:13:22.691 --> 00:13:25.222
Your interest is tax deductible.

00:13:25.222 --> 00:13:26.940
Your interest, not your whole payment.

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:31.940
Your interest is tax deductible.

00:13:34.494 --> 00:13:36.495
I want to be very clear
what deductible means.

00:13:36.495 --> 00:13:38.271
First let's talk about
what the interest means.

00:13:38.271 --> 00:13:42.555
This whole time over 30 years
I am paying $2,100 a month,

00:13:42.555 --> 00:13:46.001
or $2129.21 a month.

00:13:46.003 --> 00:13:49.448
Now the beginning, a
lot of that is interest.

00:13:49.962 --> 00:13:52.899
So on month one, 1,700
of that was interest.

00:13:52.899 --> 00:13:56.182
That $1,700 is tax deductible.

00:13:56.242 --> 00:13:57.821
As we go further and further,

00:13:57.821 --> 00:14:01.803
each month I get smaller and
smaller tax deductible portion

00:14:01.803 --> 00:14:04.241
of my actual mortgage payment.

00:14:04.241 --> 00:14:06.505
Out here the tax deduction
is actually very small,

00:14:06.505 --> 00:14:10.068
as I'm getting ready to
pay off my entire mortgage

00:14:10.068 --> 00:14:11.729
and get the title of my house.

00:14:11.729 --> 00:14:13.307
I want to be very clear on this notion

00:14:13.307 --> 00:14:15.444
of what tax deductible even means,

00:14:15.444 --> 00:14:18.823
because I think it is
misunderstood very often.

00:14:20.207 --> 00:14:25.207
Let's say in one year
I paid, I don't know,

00:14:25.637 --> 00:14:26.810
I'm gonna make up a number,

00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:28.133
I didn't calculate it on the spreadsheet.

00:14:28.133 --> 00:14:33.133
Let's say in year one I
pay $10,000 in interest.

00:14:36.515 --> 00:14:39.787
10,000 in interest.

00:14:39.847 --> 00:14:42.111
Remember, my actual payments
will be higher than that

00:14:42.111 --> 00:14:44.014
because some of my payments went

00:14:44.014 --> 00:14:45.873
to actually paying down the loan.

00:14:45.873 --> 00:14:48.296
But let's say 10,000 went to interest.

00:14:49.248 --> 00:14:50.899
And let's say before this,

00:14:50.899 --> 00:14:54.475
let's say before this
I was making 100,000,

00:14:54.475 --> 00:14:55.763
let's put the loan aside.

00:14:55.763 --> 00:14:59.059
Let's say I was making $100,000 a year,

00:14:59.664 --> 00:15:03.042
and let's say I was paying
roughly 35% on that 100,000.

00:15:03.042 --> 00:15:05.318
I won't go into the whole tax structure

00:15:05.318 --> 00:15:07.373
and the different
brackets and all of that.

00:15:07.373 --> 00:15:09.335
Let's say if I didn't have this mortgage

00:15:09.335 --> 00:15:12.237
I would pay 35% taxes,

00:15:13.406 --> 00:15:18.406
which would be about $35,000
in taxes for that year.

00:15:19.667 --> 00:15:21.394
This is just a rough estimate.

00:15:21.394 --> 00:15:25.309
When you say that $10,000
is tax deductible,

00:15:25.309 --> 00:15:26.749
the interest is tax deductible,

00:15:26.749 --> 00:15:31.022
that does not mean that I can
just take it from the $35,000

00:15:31.022 --> 00:15:34.468
that I would have normally
owed and only pay 25,000.

00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:38.068
What it means is I can deduct
this amount from my income.

00:15:38.068 --> 00:15:41.087
When I tell the IRS how
much did I make this year,

00:15:41.087 --> 00:15:45.742
instead of saying I made $100,000,
I say that I made $90,000

00:15:46.449 --> 00:15:48.714
because I was able to deduct this,

00:15:48.714 --> 00:15:50.513
not directly from my taxes,

00:15:50.513 --> 00:15:53.507
I was able to deduct it from my income.

00:15:53.694 --> 00:15:56.434
So now if I only made $90,000 --

00:15:56.434 --> 00:15:58.593
and this is, I'm doing a
gross oversimplification

00:15:58.593 --> 00:16:00.568
of how taxes actually get calculated --

00:16:00.568 --> 00:16:05.233
and I pay 35% of that, let's
get the calculator out.

00:16:06.615 --> 00:16:08.170
Let's get the calculator.

00:16:08.207 --> 00:16:13.207
So 90 times .35 is equal to 31,500.

00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:20.370
So this will be equal to $31,500.

00:16:23.193 --> 00:16:25.759
$31,500.

00:16:25.759 --> 00:16:30.705
Off of a 10,000 deduction,
$10,000 of deductible interest,

00:16:30.705 --> 00:16:35.705
I essentially saved $3,500.
I did not save $10,000.

00:16:35.756 --> 00:16:37.021
Another way to think about it,

00:16:37.021 --> 00:16:40.643
if I paid 10,000 interest
and my tax rate is 35%,

00:16:40.643 --> 00:16:44.960
I'm gonna save 35% of
this in actual taxes.

00:16:45.043 --> 00:16:47.283
This is what people mean
when they say deductible.

00:16:47.283 --> 00:16:48.839
You're deducting it from the income

00:16:48.839 --> 00:16:50.639
that you report to the IRS.

00:16:50.639 --> 00:16:52.403
If there's something that
you could take straight

00:16:52.403 --> 00:16:55.281
from your taxes, that's
called a tax credit.

00:16:55.735 --> 00:16:57.883
If there was some special
thing that you could actually

00:16:57.883 --> 00:17:01.224
deduct it straight from your
taxes, that's a tax credit.

00:17:02.854 --> 00:17:05.903
But a deduction just
takes it from your income.

00:17:05.963 --> 00:17:07.983
On this spreadsheet I
just want to show you

00:17:07.983 --> 00:17:09.969
that I actually calculated, in that month,

00:17:09.969 --> 00:17:12.625
how much of a tax deduction do you get.

00:17:12.848 --> 00:17:15.413
So for example, just off
of the first month you paid

00:17:15.413 --> 00:17:20.413
$1,700 in interest of your
$2,100 mortgage payment,

00:17:21.113 --> 00:17:25.607
so 35% of that, and I got 35%
as one of your assumptions,

00:17:25.607 --> 00:17:30.607
35% of $1,700, I will save
$600 in taxes on that month.

00:17:31.272 --> 00:17:34.128
So roughly over the
course of the first year

00:17:34.128 --> 00:17:37.506
I'm gonna save about $7,000 in taxes,

00:17:37.506 --> 00:17:39.653
so that's nothing to sneeze at.

00:17:39.653 --> 00:17:41.628
Anyway, hopefully you found this helpful

00:17:41.628 --> 00:17:44.607
and I encourage you to
go to that spreadsheet,

00:17:44.607 --> 00:17:46.068
and play with the assumptions,

00:17:46.068 --> 00:17:47.556
only the assumptions in this brown color

00:17:47.556 --> 00:17:49.982
unless you really know what
you're doing with a spreadsheet,

00:17:49.982 --> 00:17:53.569
and you can see how this
actually changes based on

00:17:53.569 --> 00:17:55.404
different interest rates,
different loan amounts,

00:17:55.404 --> 00:17:57.249
different down payments, different terms.

00:17:57.249 --> 00:17:58.260
Different tax rates,

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:01.104
that will actually change the tax savings,

00:18:01.104 --> 00:18:03.008
and you can play around
with the different types

00:18:03.008 --> 00:18:05.642
of fixed mortgages on this spreadsheet.
