00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:14.610
&gt;&gt; Good morning everyone.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:15.950
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:17.260
&gt;&gt; Welcome to the
Library of Congress.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.560
Who's been here before?

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.860
&gt;&gt; Me.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.160
&gt;&gt; Sasha Dowdy: Hi,
welcome back.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.430
And, who is here for
the very first time?

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.240
Welcome. I'm so glad
you guys are here.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.190
We have such a special
program for you today.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.600
We have two special guests
and we're going to start

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.310
with somebody who works with me.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.190
So, my name is Sasha
Dowdy and I work here

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.490
in the Young Readers Center.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.030
We're the space for
kids under 16.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.620
Everybody under 16 here?

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.150
So, this is a space just
for you in this library,

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.450
the biggest library in the
world, so you own this space.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.540
This is a pretty
good place to be.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.020
And, the person who works
with me, my colleague,

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.720
his name is Ahmed Johnson.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.390
He works in Library Services

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.530
in a division called
History and Genealogy.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.130
Everybody know what history is?

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:01.430
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:02.810
&gt;&gt; Sasha Dowdy: Everybody
know what genealogy is?

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.110
&gt;&gt; No.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.410
&gt;&gt; Sasha Dowdy: Right,

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.590
that's exactly how I
wanted to hear that.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.910
So, Ahmed is going to tell you
all about what genealogy means,

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.210
what he does with it and
what it has anything to do

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.510
with our program today.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.510
So, how about we
welcome Ahmed Johnson.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.180
[ Applause ]

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.480
&gt;&gt; Ahmed Johnson: Thank
you so much Sasha.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.280
Once again, my name is Ahmed,
Ahmed Johnson and I work here

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.240
at the Library of Congress.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.250
And, my specialty is
African American Genealogy.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.020
And, what does that mean?

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.170
Can anybody tell me
what genealogy means?

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.830
No. Nobody.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:48.300
Genealogy is the study
of your family history.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.390
Okay. So, is anyone interested

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.400
in maybe what their grandparents
were doing at your age,

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.410
maybe their great-grandparents
and so on?

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.990
Well, here at the Library
of Congress, we have books

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.710
where people have documented
their family histories, okay.

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.480
And, you can come here, and you
can search our catalogs and see

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.480
if we have anything
relevant to your family.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.700
Can everybody see
this chart here?

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.000
What's this?

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.300
[ Inaudible ]

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.600
&gt;&gt; Ahmed Johnson:
It's a family tree.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.450
And, the most interesting thing
about this family tree is,

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.720
it's not my family but
it's the Blackwell family

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.500
and it goes back to 1789.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.800
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.100
&gt;&gt; Ahmed Johnson: How
many years ago was that?

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.790
Can anybody tell me?

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.710
About 300 years, yes exactly.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.010
Good answer.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.320
So, here's an example
of what happens is,

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.560
people donate their
family histories

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.150
to the Library of
Congress, okay.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.530
And, I also have a picture.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.850
So, what I want everyone to do

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.970
over the Thanksgiving
break is ask questions.

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.300
Ask your parents about their
parents and their parents

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.540
and so forth and then I
want you to document it.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:02.960
I have handouts over here

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.690
where you could document
this information, okay?

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.560
Because one day, what do I want?

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.890
I want your family history to be
here at the Library of Congress.

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.620
Everybody good with that?

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:14.920
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.220
&gt;&gt; Ahmed Johnson: Can I
get a hand clap for that?

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.240
All right, so I have
another goodie here.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.220
This is a picture of my family.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.280
This is my grandmother
at the age of 2,

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.160
she's now 98 years old.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.200
So, I'm showing you this

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.840
to encourage you to
do the same thing.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.570
Look for pictures.

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.140
Look in a photo album,
find pictures,

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.910
document the information that
you find from the picture.

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.930
Now, I'm going to
pass this around,

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.320
but this is very valuable to me.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.620
So, what do I want?

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.720
I want it back, because this
is a treasure in my family,

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.890
so I'm going to start
right here and take a look

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.260
at that picture, okay.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.660
And, at the end of the program,
if you have any questions,

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.330
I'm here to answer them.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:02.670
Thank you so much guys.

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.510
Thank you.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:10.150
[ Applause ]

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.300
&gt;&gt; Sasha Dowdy: Thank you very
much and you guys can learn

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:13.900
so much more about genealogy.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.930
You can work with your
teachers and your family

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.120
to look what you can find
at the Library of Congress.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.500
You can come in person
or you can go online,

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.800
so that's pretty cool.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:26.540
So, next up we have our author
guest today, Megan McDonald,

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.670
she is an author
of so many books.

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.210
She's written some
picture books.

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.530
She's written some
chapter books.

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.410
Who here has heard of "Stink"?

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.960
Who's heard of "Judy Moody"?

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.130
This is the author of
Judy Moody and Stink,

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.650
she also writes all
kinds of stories.

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.380
She gathers stories
and she shares them

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.250
and there was even a movie made
about one of her books, yeah,

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.420
the Judy, yeah exactly
you guys are fans here,

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.830
so how about we hear
from Megan McDonald

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.010
about the newest book she
wrote in the Judy Moody series

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.580
and what it has to
do with genealogy.

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.510
So how about we welcome
here, Megan McDonald.

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:10.040
[ Applause ]

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.340
&gt;&gt; Megan McDonald: Thank you.

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:12.640
Thank you everybody.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.640
I'm so happy to be here and
I want to thank the Library

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.330
of Congress and First
Book and Candlewick Press

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.100
for all working together
to bring me here

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.920
to talk with you today.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.870
Most of my Judy Moody and Stink
stories come from my family,

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.230
from a story that really
happened in my family.

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:33.220
So, you're going to hear a
lot about my big sisters.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.870
I have four older sisters;
don't you feel sorry for me?

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.140
Four. But actually,
growing up with sisters,

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.270
a lot of funny things happened
and I'd like to make them happen

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.000
to my characters
in the books, okay.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.310
I'm going to tell you a lot
about my new book, "Judy Moody

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.560
and the Right Royal Tea Party",
but first I wanted to start

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.770
out showing you, I
thought it would be fun,

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.190
you get to see the book when
it's all finished and it's

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:01.320
in the library, hopefully all of
the mistakes are fixed by then

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.270
and all the pictures are done,
but I thought it would be fun

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:07.760
to show you, since I'm a writer,
well what does it really look

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.910
like when I first start to
write a Judy Moody book?

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:15.530
Okay, so here's what
it actually looks like.

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:19.990
Here's how a book
starts for me, ta-da.

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.080
Do you know what this is?

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.050
&gt;&gt; A napkin!

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:25.350
&gt;&gt; Megan McDonald:
It's a napkin.

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.340
Most people use it to wipe
their mouth after lunch right?

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.630
But I'm a writer, so
I write on anything.

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:36.820
If I get a great idea for Judy
Moody, I might not be at home,

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:40.850
I might not have my computer
or I might not have my notebook

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:43.970
with me, so I just scribble
it on whatever I have,

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:45.690
something like a napkin.

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:50.310
On this napkin if you could see
in the middle here, it says,

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:55.370
instead of Judy Moody, it
says, Judy Muddy and that idea,

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:57.990
the funny sound of
mixing up her name,

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:02.510
that idea became the whole
book, "Judy Moody Gets Famous".

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:06.670
In that book, Judy decides she's
going to try some funny ways

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:09.970
to get, to try to become
famous and get her picture

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:15.050
in the newspaper, but the
thing that she thinks up is,

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:20.440
she decides her, she finds out
there's a famous pet contest

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:25.410
at the pet store and in
the pet contest, if you,

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:28.000
if your pet has a
really good pet trick,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.180
you can enter your pet in
the contest, if your pet wins

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:34.100
for the best trick then
you get your picture taken

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:36.380
with your pet in the newspaper.

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:41.370
So, Judy has a cat named
Mouse and Judy is sure

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:43.800
that Mouse is going to
be her ticket to fame,

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.770
to getting her picture in
the paper, because Mouse,

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:50.460
I'll put him on, her
up on the screen.

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:54.670
Oh, here's the napkin a little
bit bigger so you can see

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:56.830
where it says Judy Muddy there

00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:00.090
and here's the book
I'm referring

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:02.840
to in Judy Moody Gets Famous.

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:07.110
So, Mouse has a special talent,
she knows how to make toast.

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:10.640
Her cat can push down the
little button on the toaster

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.340
and up pops the toast.

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:15.630
And, Judy's like, what can be
a better pet trick than a cat

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:17.250
who makes toast, right.

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:19.760
So, she's sure they're going to
win the contest and she's going

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:22.310
to get her picture in the
paper, but when she gets

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:27.340
to the pet store, there's a
chicken who plays the piano.

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.800
So, Judy gets, Judy
and Mouse get beat

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:34.160
out by the piano playing
chicken, so instead of winning,

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.080
she gets second place,
but she thinks, hey,

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:40.310
at least I'll still get my
picture in the paper, right.

00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:43.690
So, when the photographer
goes to snap the picture,

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:47.960
just as she scoops up Mouse
and has her cat in her arms,

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.900
and just as the photographer
goes to take the picture,

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:53.920
Mouse leaps out of her arm and
scratches her and Judy goes,

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:57.690
aah!, like this, and instead
of her face, the only thing

00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:01.170
that gets in the picture
in the paper is her elbow.

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:03.280
So, instead of getting famous,

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:07.790
she just has one
famous elbow, poor Judy.

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:11.890
But now she thinks, okay, even
though it's just my elbow,

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:14.870
it'll say my name under
the caption in the picture,

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:17.710
right and everybody'll
that's me Judy Moody.

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:21.590
And, she goes to read her
name in the paper and instead

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:25.110
of Judy Moody, the
newspaper made a mistake

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:27.020
and they spelled her name wrong.

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:29.590
They called her Judy Muddy.

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:33.620
So, that was the idea
when I first thought

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:36.530
of that something could
go wrong when she tries

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:38.130
to get her picture in the paper.

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:39.880
I scribbled it down
on the napkin

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:42.140
and that's how it all started.

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:47.560
Then after I was thinking
about what could go wrong,

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:51.810
I remembered something really
funny that happened to me

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:56.480
when I first became a published
writer, I got my picture

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:59.490
in the paper and I thought
it would be so exciting

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:01.460
to see my picture in the paper.

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:02.760
So, the day it came out,

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:05.850
I went to the store
and I made a mistake.

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:10.240
I should've just looked inside
the newspaper first to make sure

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:13.160
that I would want anybody
to see the picture of me,

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.290
but I didn't look inside.

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:17.980
I bought a bunch of papers
and I brought them home

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:20.910
and when I got home and
I opened the newspaper,

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:22.850
I couldn't believe my eyes.

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:28.070
The newspaper made a mistake
and instead of the picture of me

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:31.250
for the author Megan
McDonald, they printed a pic,

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:33.520
a different picture with
my name in the paper,

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:35.860
so I brought it to
show you today.

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:37.160
Here's the picture

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.710
of the children's book
writer, Megan McDonald.

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:41.510
Okay, ready?

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:44.380
[ Laughter ]

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:45.680
&gt;&gt; Megan McDonald: What?!

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:48.000
It's a guy!

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.890
So, this is the picture
that was me.

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:53.590
If you're not sure
who this guy is,

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:55.790
because you might think
it's Elvis or something,

00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:57.360
but if you're not
sure who he is,

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:00.810
it says Megan McDonald
pictured, so everybody

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:05.130
who read the newspaper that
day thought this guy was Megan

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:09.550
McDonald, the children's
book author.

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:12.990
So, things can, things that
go, even things that go wrong

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:14.590
that happen to you
or funny things

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:17.090
like that can become
a story in a book.

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:23.280
But my favorite way to get ideas
is, I like to take funny things

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:27.820
that really happen like family
stories from when I was your age

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:29.540
and put them in my
book, so I'm going

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:31.160
to tell you a family story.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:34.650
I'll tell you the true story
of what really happened,

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:37.220
then I'll show you how
I change it for by book.

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:42.310
Okay, but in real life, this is
a story of a really funny joke

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:45.010
that I got to play
on my sisters.

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:49.780
And, when you're the youngest
of five, your older sis,

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:52.570
my older sisters were
always pranking me

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:53.870
and playing jokes on me.

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:56.920
But one time, this is
the one time I remember

00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:00.830
when I got my sisters so
good, so I wanted to put

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:03.000
that family story
in my book, okay.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.920
But in real life,
my whole family,

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:07.470
we grew up in Pennsylvania,
but we got to come

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:12.720
to Washington D.C., and we were
just here to visit our friends,

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:15.270
but when we got here my
mom and dad were like,

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:18.720
hey it's the Capitol and it's
where the White House is,

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:20.510
we could go take a tour.

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:23.710
So, my mom and my dad
and all four sisters,

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:25.100
all got to take a tour.

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:26.900
They went to the White House.

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:28.580
Back then it was
a long time ago,

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:33.090
so a man named John F.
Kennedy was the president.

00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:39.230
And, my mom, dad, and all four
sisters got to go take a tour

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:41.330
of the White House
when he was president.

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:42.630
I was too little.

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:44.990
They said, I would get
bored and I would cry,

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:47.870
so I had to stay home
with our friends.

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:49.440
But I was so disappointed

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.740
because when you're
the youngest,

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:54.260
you want to do everything your
big sisters get to do, right.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.480
So, I wanted to go, even though
I didn't know what the White

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:00.500
House was, I was too little,
but I knew I wanted to go.

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:03.500
Well, I was so disappointed,
I stayed home with the friends

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:05.950
and the friends were
trying to cheer me up.

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:09.020
And, to cheer me up,
they got out this box,

00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:10.840
they had with all
these cool toys

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:12.410
from when their kids
were little.

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:15.650
They said I could play with
whatever I wanted in the box

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:18.320
and if I found one
thing I really like,

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.800
they said I could use
it, I could keep it

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.640
and take it home with me.

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:26.650
So, I went all through the
box, and as soon as I saw it,

00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:29.990
I knew exactly which
thing I was going to keep,

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:33.990
because I knew I could use it
to play a really funny joke

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:38.610
on my sisters while they were
at the White House and I wasn't.

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:41.970
And, the thing was, if anybody,

00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:45.060
has anybody here read the
first Judy Moody book?

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:46.360
If you've read the first book,

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:49.260
you might've guessed,
but the thing was.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.990
&gt;&gt; A hand.

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:54.690
&gt;&gt; Megan McDonald: Yes,
a fake hand and it looked

00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:57.670
so real even though
it's just plastic.

00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:58.970
It looked really real.

00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:02.810
So, I took the fake hand and
I'm like, this is really going

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:04.660
to freak out my sisters, right.

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:08.330
I went all over our friend's
house and I was like,

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:12.510
what would be the absolute
best place to put the fake hand

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:14.870
to really freak out my sisters?

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:19.420
So, after I went through all the
rooms, I got to the bathroom.

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:20.790
You knew it?

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:22.330
You guessed.

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:24.600
See, I think like a kid, right?

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:31.340
And, I was like, hey, I
know, how about the toilet?

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:34.720
So, I made sure nobody
was watching and I went

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:37.640
into the bathroom and I
lifted up the toilet seat

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:40.790
and I made the fake hand
stick out of the toilet.

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:45.390
It looks like it's
reaching out to get you.

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:49.810
And, then, so I setup the joke,
then I waited for my sisters

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:52.020
to come home from
the White House.

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:53.850
It took them forever.

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:56.690
They were there all day
and when they got back,

00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:57.990
they were so excited

00:14:57.990 --> 00:15:00.360
about everything they had
seen at the White House.

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:04.530
They were talking, talking,
talking, I was hardly listening,

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:10.090
because all I could think about
is when is somebody going to go

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:13.870
in that bathroom and find what?

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:20.950
The hand. And, finally my sister
Michelle went into the bathroom

00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:23.340
and she goes in there
and shuts the door

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:27.250
and like two seconds later,
we hear this like ahh,

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:30.500
this really big scream
and she came running

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:31.800
out of the bathroom, no lie.

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:36.850
She goes mom, dad, there's
somebody in the toilet.

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:40.380
And, we were cracking up so bad,

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:43.710
my sisters are all grown
ups now, it doesn't matter,

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:48.390
when we all get together, we
still like to tell the story

00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:51.440
of the fake hand in the toilet.

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:56.420
So, I decided, hey, that's
a funny story from my family

00:15:56.420 --> 00:16:01.320
that I'm going to have happen
to my characters, but of course,

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:04.130
when you're writing you
can use your imagination,

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:06.610
it doesn't have to be
exactly like real life.

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:10.440
So, you can make up whatever
you want to happen right?

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:15.200
So, I decided in my book that
Stink would be the one who gets

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:18.260
to go to the White House,
he's the youngest like me.

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.570
So, he would get to go and Judy,

00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:23.130
his older sister would
have to stay home.

00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:27.120
So, Stink decides he's
going on this field trip

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.800
to the White House,
he decides he's going

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:32.210
to dress up like a human flag.

00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:36.070
So, he gets an old red and
white striped tablecloth

00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:39.360
and he dresses up
like a human flag.

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:45.600
He puts all the stars for
the 48 states on his hat.

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:46.900
What did he do wrong?

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:48.530
You guys are in 5th
grade, so you know.

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:50.700
There's 50 states, right?

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:52.920
So, he forgot there, he forgot

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:55.690
about two really important
states, Hawaii and Alaska,

00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:58.830
so Judy helps him
with the right number,

00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:01.150
put the right number
of stars on his hat.

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:04.120
He goes off on his field trip
to the White House, but Judy has

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:05.880
to go to school that day.

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:08.790
It's a regular school day
and when she gets to school

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:14.390
that day, it just happens to be
brush your teeth week at school.

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:19.090
During brush your teeth week,
two dentists come to school,

00:17:19.090 --> 00:17:22.260
Mr. Tooth and Mrs. Floss.

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:25.660
They dress up like a tooth
and a box of dental floss.

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:28.430
And, they're there to tell you
all about brushing your teeth,

00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:32.540
but Judy is like, I already
know how to brush my teeth

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:35.220
and Stink gets to go
on this great adventure

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:36.520
to the White House.

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:39.130
Well, to make matters even
worse, out of all the kids

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:41.580
in the kids in the school
they pick Judy Moody.

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:44.020
She has to come up
in front of everybody

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:45.970
and she has to be the cavity.

00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:50.710
So, Stink gets to
be a human flag,

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:54.160
Judy has to be an old
tooth with a hole in it.

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:58.630
And, now she's in
a bad, mad mood,

00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:01.990
and that's when she gets
the idea, hey, I know,

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:05.780
I'm going to play a funny
joke on Stink while he's

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:09.950
at the White House and I'm
not, sound familiar right.

00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:13.960
So, Judy played, plays
the same joke I did,

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:17.570
she borrows the fake hand
from her friend Rocky,

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:22.070
and she goes all over the house
and she puts the fake hand

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:24.250
in the toilet just like I did.

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:28.250
So, when Stink gets home from
the White House, he finally goes

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:31.780
into the bathroom and when he
sees the fake hand it freaks him

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:35.070
out and he comes screaming
out of the bathroom and all

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:40.990
of the stars for the 50 states
go flying off of his hat.

00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:46.920
So, that's just one example
of how I take a family story

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:49.250
from my own family and
make it happen in my book.

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:52.800
If you guys like to write and
illustrate your own books,

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:55.330
you can do the same
thing and of course,

00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:59.740
with genealogy you can even go
back further and tell a story

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:02.470
about a grandma or
grandpa or somebody

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:05.270
that goes back even
further in your family.

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:14.190
Kids, often when I'm speaking,
kids will ask me, what other,

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:17.110
did you write any other
books besides Judy Moody?

00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:22.100
So, I brought a few to show you,
I'm going to skip ahead here.

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:26.360
My very first book that I ever
got published is this book

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:29.640
called, "Is This a
House for Hermit Crab?"

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:33.190
and it was a book I told
before I became a writer,

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:36.460
I was a librarian, a children's
librarian and I told stories

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:40.400
at the library all the time and
this was based on a story I told

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:43.570
at the library, just a story
about a hermit crab walking

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:46.960
on the beach, looking
for just the right home.

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:52.660
So, before there was Judy Moody,
I wrote a lot of picture books,

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:54.670
one about a grumpy
princess called,

00:19:54.670 --> 00:20:01.170
"The Hinky Pink" a really
exciting true-life story called,

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:02.470
"Saving the Liberty Bell".

00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:06.780
This is historical fiction,
and this is a true story

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:10.190
of a time during the
American Revolution.

00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:13.740
We don't usually get this, hear
this story in our history books,

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:16.200
I'm not sure why
because it's so exciting.

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:18.780
During the revolution,
the British were coming

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:22.420
into Philadelphia, they wanted
to capture the Liberty Bell

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:25.400
and melt down all the
metal from the bell

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:28.410
and would've even had the
Liberty Bell if they did that.

00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:32.130
So, a group of farmers from
Allentown, Pennsylvania,

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:36.390
decided, hey, we, the Liberty
Bell is our somebody of freedom,

00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:38.080
we don't want it melted down,

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:40.900
so they got all their
farmers wagons

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:44.580
and at midnight one night,
under the cover of darkness,

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:47.510
they snuck into Philadelphia
and they cap,

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:50.680
they took down the Liberty
Bell and they hid it

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:52.020
on the farmer's wagon.

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:56.500
They covered it with straw
and a lady's old hoop skirt,

00:20:56.500 --> 00:21:00.910
and they took it all the way
back through the night to,

00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:03.940
back to Allentown where they
were from and they hid it

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:06.300
in the basement of
a church there.

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:07.890
And, you can still, I got to go

00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:09.610
when I was researching
this book.

00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:13.210
You can still go to this
basement of the church and see

00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:14.510
where the bell was hidden

00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:16.920
and they have a replica
of the bell there.

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:21.790
And, I found out all the
farmers were grownups,

00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:25.630
but one farmer took his
11-year-old boy with him,

00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:28.700
so I told the story
from the 11-year-old boy

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:32.340
that went on that trip.

00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:34.510
A friend of mine who
is an illustrator,

00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:38.190
drew this wonderful picture of
a dog who likes to eat, what?

00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:39.490
&gt;&gt; Shoes.

00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:41.200
&gt;&gt; Megan McDonald: So, that
became a book I did called,

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:48.450
"Shoe Dog" and if you like
Judy Moody books or if you

00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:51.850
like funny stories, some of
the funny stories of growing

00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:56.510
up with all my sisters, I use
a lot of those funny stories

00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:59.950
in my books about
The Sister's Club.

00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:04.560
This is about three sisters
instead of five and each one is,

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:07.380
there story is told
in a different voice

00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:09.960
from each sister's
point of view.

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:12.980
And, there are some great sister
stories, when you have a lot

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:16.360
of sisters, there's always
a lot of hair disasters

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:19.680
and when my sisters were
teenagers, the style was

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:22.210
to have, we all have curly
hair, but the style was

00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:23.710
to have straight hair.

00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:25.840
So, my sisters to
get straight hair,

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:30.290
use to iron their hair
on the ironing board.

00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:32.160
Yeah, they would take,
they had long hair

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:34.130
and they literally
like, would lean over,

00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:36.800
lay it out on the ironing board,
you get the iron really hot

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:40.800
and then you iron the
hair to make it straight.

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:44.400
Well, remember what I
said about hair disasters?

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:47.740
One time my sister was
getting her hair ironed

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:51.310
and another sister was
ironing it and the phone rang

00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:53.830
and in those days, we
didn't have cell phones.

00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:55.190
You had to go in the other room

00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:57.420
and answer the phone
on the wall, right.

00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:00.880
So, she went to answer the
phone, but she put the iron.

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.700
&gt;&gt; She left the iron
on her hair.

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:05.490
&gt;&gt; Megan McDonald: You guys are
storytellers, you already know.

00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:09.720
She left the iron on her
hair and when she came back

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:13.390
from the phone, all this smoke
was coming up from her hair

00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:16.510
and when she lifted up the iron,
there was like a big, you know,

00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:18.740
how an iron is like a triangle?

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:21.640
There was a big shape of
the iron that got burned

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:25.690
out of the back of her hair,
so I retell that story in one

00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:28.350
of my Sister's Club books.

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:32.690
Here's a picture of the four
sisters I've been telling you

00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:37.050
about when they were
young and my mom.

00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:41.250
This is, I wanted to show
you a picture of the sisters

00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:43.680
from when they were young,
from when we were growing up.

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:47.760
So, I told my sisters that I put
this photo in the show for you

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:50.420
and they're like, well you have
to show everybody a picture

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:53.320
of you, because you're
not in this picture.

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:58.080
So, I made a mistake, I told
my sisters they could choose

00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:02.480
which picture I would show you
today, so here's the picture

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:04.730
of me that they chose
to show you.

00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:07.140
They said, we're
picking this picture

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:11.740
because it's the best way to
show how I went from a kid

00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:14.260
to grow up into somebody
who writes

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:16.110
about a girl with
a lot of moods.

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:17.910
Okay, so here's me.

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:23.040
[ Laughter ]

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:25.140
&gt;&gt; Megan McDonald: This
is me when I was probably

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:29.740
like 2 years old or something
and my mom and dad just wanted

00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:32.100
to take a nice, they
dressed me up and they wanted

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:35.800
to take a nice picture of
me, and I was not having it.

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:38.230
I would not get my
picture taken.

00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:41.850
I, Megan McDonald was in a mood.

00:24:41.850 --> 00:24:46.320
So, I went over to the neighbors
and I laid down with my face

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:49.740
on the driveway and I was
kicking my feet, and my sister,

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:51.160
the one I played the joke on,

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:54.930
she had just gotten a little
brownie camera for her birthday,

00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:56.740
she came out and
took a whole roll

00:24:56.740 --> 00:25:01.080
of pictures throwing a tantrum
on the neighbors driveway,

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:04.950
so that's, we can
that one Megan Moody.

00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:07.570
Here's me today.

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:11.190
Kids, readers often
ask me where I write,

00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:14.020
so there's a little room
upstairs in my house

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:19.400
where I have a lot of, like Judy
Moody, I like to collect stuff,

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:21.020
so you can see some of the th--

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:23.510
Judy Moody has some
funny collections like,

00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:26.410
she collects pizza tables,
you know, those little things

00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:29.520
in the pizza box that hold
the lid up from getting

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:33.700
in the cheese and this
is the giant jawbreaker.

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:37.480
I think I might own the world's
biggest jawbreaker maybe.

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:40.330
But that jawbreaker
inspired "Stink

00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:44.120
and the Incredible
Super-Galactic Jawbreaker".

00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:48.120
Judy collects Band-Aids, she
admires Elizabeth Blackwell

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:51.820
who was the first woman to
become a doctor in our country.

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:53.910
If you could believe
it, there was a time

00:25:53.910 --> 00:25:56.460
where only boys could
go to medical school.

00:25:56.460 --> 00:26:00.150
And, Elizabeth Blackwell thought
that wasn't fair, so she applied

00:26:00.150 --> 00:26:03.620
and became the first doctor,
so Judy collects Band-Aids,

00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:06.230
because she admires
Elizabeth Blackwell and wants

00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:08.490
to be a doctor when
she grows up.

00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:14.130
And, then if you look right
here, she, Judy also collects A,

00:26:14.130 --> 00:26:17.060
B, oh yeah, you see the
hand, where's the hand?

00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:18.680
Oh yeah, it's right up here.

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:21.770
I have a little mini version.

00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:23.730
She collects ABC gum.

00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:27.050
Do you guys know what that is?

00:26:27.050 --> 00:26:31.980
ABC stands for already
been chewed.

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:35.760
So, when we made the
movie of Judy Moody,

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:39.230
one of the things I got to
do to help with the movie is,

00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:44.120
I got to help the artist
tell them what might be

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:47.440
in Judy Moody's room and
pick out some of the stuff

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:48.740
that got to be in her room.

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:51.640
And, I said, well she has to
have her ABC gum collection,

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:56.160
so the artist on the movie made
a whole collection out of clay

00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:59.080
to look like it's gum
that's already been chewed

00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:01.850
and they put it on that
little board and they,

00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:06.240
they even made a name
for every flavor of gum

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:07.950
and they hung it on the door.

00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:10.890
So, when you watch the movie,
if you look in her room,

00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:18.070
you will be able to see
the ABC gum collection.

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:21.210
I also wanted to show
you a rough draft.

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:22.530
This is what it really looks

00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:25.400
like when I'm working
on Judy moody.

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:31.060
This is from the very first book
and my editor is here today,

00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:34.900
so I can't say anything bad.

00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:37.390
But she's the one
with the red pen,

00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:42.940
I'm the one with the typewriting
and she has a lot of opinions

00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:44.900
and suggestions, oddly enough.

00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:48.500
Of course, when I first send her
the book, I think it's perfect

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:51.020
and it doesn't need to
change at all, right,

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:54.530
but she never things so,
she always finds suggestions

00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:57.360
and things, and it's
actually great

00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:59.680
because it makes it
a much better book.

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:02.390
She cuts out all the boring
parts, so you guys don't have

00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:05.360
to read those parts which
makes the book funnier.

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:07.930
She helps me get a
really good ending.

00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:10.750
I have trouble sometimes
coming up with titles,

00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:16.340
so she helps me sometimes even
think up a really good title.

00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:18.510
Even spelling the words
the words the right way,

00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:20.970
it helps to have someone
to help you with that.

00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:23.620
So, I just wanted to show you
what it looks like because

00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:26.700
when I write a book, I
usually write it, maybe three

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:29.060
or four different times,
so I go through a lot

00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:33.030
of sloppy copies
and rough drafts.

00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:36.480
The illustrator for
Judy Moody is Peter,

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:39.900
his name is Peter
Reynolds and Peter also has

00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:41.200
to go through rough drafts.

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:44.500
Imagine, like when you first
got the story, he had to figure

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:47.440
out what's Judy Moody
going to look like.

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:50.280
So, the first time I got
to see a sketch of her,

00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:52.770
this is what she looks like,
but if she's supposed to be

00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:55.260
in 3rd grade, what
do you think not,

00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:58.480
might not be right
about this drawing?

00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:01.040
Yeah, she's too short
and too young right.

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:04.750
She looks like she might
only be 4 or 5 years old.

00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:08.070
So, I went to a classroom near
my house and took pictures

00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:11.000
of 3rd graders and we
sent them to Peter,

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.420
and he made her taller, but
this time, this is supposed

00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:16.570
to be the cover of
the very first book.

00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:18.910
And, it's a funny book,
so you want the cover

00:29:18.910 --> 00:29:21.000
to make you laugh, right.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.980
So, he put this, a
different mood on the cover

00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:28.060
that I thought would not
really make us laugh.

00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:33.530
Doesn't she look too sad
to be on a funny book?

00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:39.520
She looks like she just had
the most bummer summer ever.

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:43.050
So, now my editor went
back to Peter and said,

00:29:43.050 --> 00:29:44.790
can we try maybe
a different mood

00:29:44.790 --> 00:29:47.980
where she doesn't
look quite so sad.

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:50.750
So, now we're getting,
she's a little taller

00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:55.180
and we're getting closer,
but now in the next one I got

00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:59.870
to see, she looks kind of scary.

00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:08.600
Doesn't she look scary like
she's making a me collage,

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:12.470
all about herself and her family
and her interests, but she looks

00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:15.070
like she's going to hurt
somebody with those scissors.

00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:18.220
&gt;&gt; I have an idea, you
should've, you should've,

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:21.130
you should've drew her
laying on the floor.

00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:22.430
&gt;&gt; Megan McDonald: Yeah.

00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:26.410
Exactly. That would've
been good.

00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:31.840
So, finally Peter he had
to start all over again.

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:36.110
Finally, he drew Judy to look
like this and I love this sketch

00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:38.990
because it looks like she's just

00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:42.420
about to play a funny
joke on Stink, right?

00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:46.230
And, she has her famous
tiger striped pajamas on

00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:49.840
and she's the only kid with
the shirt with no words,

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:53.720
so she's going to write, I
ate a shark on her shirt.

00:30:53.720 --> 00:31:02.050
This became the first
cover based on that sketch.

00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:03.500
You guys read that one?

00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:08.250
And, today, Judy has a brand-new
look and a brand-new cover

00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:10.870
with her tiger stripes
and looks more

00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:17.710
like this in full color, yeah.

00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:20.450
Okay, now I want to skip
a little bit and I want

00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:23.570
to tell you about my
brand-new book, "Judy Moody

00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:25.330
and the Right Royal Tea Party".

00:31:25.330 --> 00:31:29.210
This book, even though
Judy Moody is made

00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:33.070
up in my imagination, I decided
I was going to write a book

00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:36.030
where Judy was going to
do a family tree like,

00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:38.300
not this complicated,
but she was going

00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:42.550
to make her own family tree
and find out if she went back

00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:44.600
to her great, great, great,
great, great, great, great,

00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:47.870
great, 13 times great
grandparents, find out about

00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:50.500
who she might be related to.

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:54.950
So, in order to do that, I had
to look up, I had to do a lot

00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:58.810
of genealogy and family
history of the name Moody

00:31:58.810 --> 00:32:03.090
because that's Judy's last name
and her family heritage, right?

00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:06.260
So, when I looked up the
name Moody, I found out,

00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:09.560
Judy would've been related to
some really interesting people,

00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:14.470
like, there was a James
Moody who was on the Titanic.

00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:18.510
And, he was like, a junior
officer, but he helped three,

00:32:18.510 --> 00:32:21.130
for three different life
boats, he helped people

00:32:21.130 --> 00:32:24.250
from the Titanic get
onto these life boats

00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:27.870
and save their lives
before he himself died,

00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:29.330
so she might've been related.

00:32:29.330 --> 00:32:33.570
She thinks she's related to
James Moody from the Titanic.

00:32:33.570 --> 00:32:36.620
When I first looked up the
name, sometimes if you look

00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:40.880
up your last name, it wasn't
always spelled the same way.

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:45.340
So, when I looked up Moody,
if you go way back to the time

00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:48.840
of Shakespeare and Queen
Elizabeth I in England,

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:53.360
her name would've been Modig,
M - O - D - I - G, Judy Modig

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:56.560
and Modig means brave
or bravery.

00:32:56.560 --> 00:33:01.560
So, when I was looking that
up, I found the spelling also,

00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:07.250
the spelling of Moody, it looks
like Mudeye, so Judy starts

00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:13.450
to think she was also related to
a pirate, Mudeye Moody and then

00:33:13.450 --> 00:33:16.270
when she goes back far enough
to the time of Shakespeare,

00:33:16.270 --> 00:33:19.620
she starts to think
that she was related

00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:22.170
to Queen Elizabeth herself.

00:33:22.170 --> 00:33:27.290
And so, if she's related to the
queen, that means the queen,

00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:31.240
the queen now, is, oh let me
skip ahead and I can show you,

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:35.380
the queen now of England
is about 90 years old.

00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:37.880
She's been the queen
for a long time.

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:43.810
And, I'll skip ahead and
show you, wait let's see.

00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:46.720
Let's see.

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:48.350
There we go, oh wait.

00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:50.430
So, here's the queen today.

00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:52.900
So, Judy decides, if
she has royal blood,

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:55.800
she would be related to
the Queen of England.

00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:57.100
&gt;&gt; She looks like her a little.

00:33:57.100 --> 00:33:58.400
&gt;&gt; Megan McDonald: She does.

00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:03.370
And, the queen is 90
but she's very fancy.

00:34:03.370 --> 00:34:08.380
She always wears these
colorful suits with a big hat.

00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:10.810
Sometimes the hat has
all these flowers on it,

00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:12.980
or she wears all of her jewels.

00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:16.040
The question the queen
gets asked the most often

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:20.280
by kids is how heavy is
that crown because it has

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:22.700
so many jewels on it,
it's hard to walk with it

00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:24.590
because it's so heavy.

00:34:24.590 --> 00:34:27.740
So, Judy decides if
she has royal blood,

00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:30.860
she just might be related
to the Queen of England,

00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:32.790
she's pretty sure she is.

00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:35.420
So, she thinks when I
give my report at school,

00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:38.950
I'm going to have the most
exciting one because I'm going

00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:41.610
to tell everybody I'm
related to the queen.

00:34:41.610 --> 00:34:45.140
But when she gets up to give
her project, she finds somebody

00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:48.190
who gives their project
in her class before her,

00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:53.390
she finds out that, that person
did a bunch of research too

00:34:53.390 --> 00:34:57.700
and that Judy may not be
related to the queen herself,

00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:01.620
she may be related to
somebody else who worked

00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:05.170
at the palace like, in the
time of Queen Elizabeth I.

00:35:05.170 --> 00:35:10.610
There was an actual job
called the royal bug destroyer

00:35:10.610 --> 00:35:15.250
and that person's job was
to squish or squash the bugs

00:35:15.250 --> 00:35:17.450
that got into the palace, right.

00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:20.790
So, Judy finds out
she might be related

00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:25.710
to the royal rat catcher
instead of the queen,

00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:28.730
so you have to read the book
to find out what happens.

00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:31.940
But when I was doing the
research, I decided you know,

00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:35.880
the Queen of England, they love
their tea in England, right,

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:37.600
so she loves to drink tea.

00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:41.490
Every day at 4:00 they
have high tea in England

00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:43.790
and high tea just
means you drink tea

00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:46.740
and you have fancy little
cookies or something with it.

00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:50.210
And so, Judy decides, hey,
I'm going to have a tea party

00:35:50.210 --> 00:35:54.530
for my friends and its going to
be at 4:00 sharp and she's going

00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:57.300
to hold it Toad Pee club tent.

00:35:57.300 --> 00:36:00.030
So, she decorates the tent
all fancy and she sets

00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:03.060
up the tea party and she
tells her friends to be there

00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:05.410
at 4:00 sharp, but she writes it

00:36:05.410 --> 00:36:08.650
in a secret code
and nobody comes.

00:36:08.650 --> 00:36:11.950
At 4:00, nobody's
there and she thinks,

00:36:11.950 --> 00:36:13.660
did they not crack the code,

00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:16.050
but she's sure they
would've cracked the code.

00:36:16.050 --> 00:36:21.070
So, then 4:01 comes, then
4:03, then 4:05, then 4:15

00:36:21.070 --> 00:36:23.540
and they're not there
and she finally learns,

00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:27.280
her friends thought a tea
parts sounded kind of boring,

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:29.070
so they weren't planning
on coming.

00:36:29.070 --> 00:36:32.740
So, Judy has to think up
how can I make a tea party

00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:34.290
really exciting?

00:36:34.290 --> 00:36:37.090
And the reason it's a
right royal tea party,

00:36:37.090 --> 00:36:40.380
in the back is a dictionary
of some funny words,

00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:43.200
the way you say things
if you live in England.

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:50.230
So, if you look up, right
royal in the back, it says,

00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:54.270
right royal means
extremely exciting and fun.

00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:58.950
So, Judy decides she's going to
make up some fun games and one

00:36:58.950 --> 00:37:02.240
of the games I made up, I
noticed when I was researching

00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:08.300
about the queen, every picture
I saw, she always had a purse.

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:11.100
She always carried
her fancy purse.

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:13.060
Well, I read that
the Queen of England,

00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:15.200
if you could believe
it, she's so fancy,

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:19.620
she owns over 300
different purses.

00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:24.320
And, I started to think
what is in your purse

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:26.690
if you're the Queen
of England, right?

00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:29.960
What would you carry in your
purse and she never leaves it

00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:31.660
at home, at the Palace.

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:36.390
So, I had to do a
lot of research,

00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:38.300
I probably should've
come to the Library

00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:39.600
of Congress to look it up.

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:41.920
I had to do a lot of
research to find out,

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:44.020
what is in the queen's purse.

00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:47.890
But I learned some really
interesting things that she has

00:37:47.890 --> 00:37:49.750
in her purse, besides tea,

00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:53.960
I should tell you the queen
also loves dogs and horses.

00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:56.680
She usually has corgis,

00:37:56.680 --> 00:38:00.910
right now she has four different
palace dogs, two are corgis

00:38:00.910 --> 00:38:03.130
and two are adopted dogs.

00:38:03.130 --> 00:38:07.530
So, she always has dogs, so I'm
going to pull some things out

00:38:07.530 --> 00:38:11.430
and some of them would be in the
queen's purse and some wouldn't,

00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:14.140
but I'm going to see if you can
guess if you think this would be

00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:15.760
in the queen's purse, okay.

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:18.690
So, do you think the Queen of
England first of all would have

00:38:18.690 --> 00:38:21.130
in her purse a tea bag?

00:38:21.130 --> 00:38:22.430
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:24.760
&gt;&gt; Megan McDonald: That's what
I thought, because they're crazy

00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:26.610
for tea over there, right?

00:38:26.610 --> 00:38:31.020
So, I thought she'd have a tea
bag, but hello, she's the queen,

00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:32.780
she doesn't make her own tea.

00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:35.510
The royal tea maker
makes the tea, right,

00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:38.490
so she doesn't even have
to carry her own tea bag.

00:38:38.490 --> 00:38:40.960
Do, you think she
would have a fancy pen?

00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:42.260
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:43.560
&gt;&gt; Megan McDonald: She does.

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:48.630
She always carries a
fancy pen in her purse.

00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:52.700
Do you think she would have a
crossword puzzle in her purse?

00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:54.000
&gt;&gt; No.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.690
&gt;&gt; Megan McDonald: I
thought no way, but she does.

00:38:56.690 --> 00:39:01.840
She always carries a crossword
in case she gets bored

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:06.780
or in case she needs to
use the fancy pen, right?

00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:10.520
So, in that way the
queen and I are alike

00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:12.370
because I always
have a crossword.

00:39:12.370 --> 00:39:18.430
Do you think the queen
would have a candy necklace?

00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:22.330
Do you think Judy Moody
would have a candy?

00:39:22.330 --> 00:39:23.630
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:24.930
&gt;&gt; Megan McDonald: So,
Judy Moody has one.

00:39:24.930 --> 00:39:26.390
The queen would probably
have real pearls

00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:28.740
or diamonds or something.

00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:32.510
We can't eat because I have
to show it to some other kids.

00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:37.420
Do you think the queen would
have some mints in her purse?

00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:38.720
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:40.250
&gt;&gt; Megan McDonald:
She always has mints

00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:45.340
because she's the queen, she
can't have bad breath, right?

00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:50.440
Okay, do you think she
would have a fancy hanky?

00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:51.740
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:53.440
&gt;&gt; Megan McDonald: You
guys are good she does.

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:58.300
She always has a fancy hanky
in case she gets the sniffles.

00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:02.820
And, the Queen of England
can't have boogers, right?

00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:07.140
Okay, do you think she
would have a fancy lipstick?

00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:08.440
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:09.740
&gt;&gt; Megan McDonald: Yes.

00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:13.810
In case she has to write
SOS like Nancy Drew?

00:40:13.810 --> 00:40:15.110
&gt;&gt; No.

00:40:15.110 --> 00:40:16.410
&gt;&gt; Megan McDonald: She
always has a fancy lipstick.

00:40:16.410 --> 00:40:20.550
Do you think she would
have a dog treat?

00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:23.740
I know. Isn't that crazy?

00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:26.720
She always carries dog
treats in her purse.

00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:28.760
That's how much the
queen loves dogs.

00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:32.440
She doesn't leave the
palace without a dog treat.

00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:38.060
Do you think she would
have a rubber ducky?

00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:39.360
&gt;&gt; No.

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:41.320
&gt;&gt; Megan McDonald: She
doesn't actually carry this

00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:44.860
in her purse, but I learned
when I was researching,

00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:48.660
the queen actually has a rubber
ducky in the royal bathroom

00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:53.790
and her rubber ducky wears
a crown, isn't that crazy?

00:40:53.790 --> 00:40:57.850
Okay, now this one's really
crazy, do you think the Queen

00:40:57.850 --> 00:41:05.480
of England would have in her
purse, a spark plug from a car?

00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:06.780
&gt;&gt; No.

00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:10.630
&gt;&gt; Megan McDonald: No, she
probably doesn't carry her own

00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:13.730
but I learned, the queen even
though she's 90 years old,

00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:17.000
she knows how to change
a spark plug in the car,

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:20.540
so if the royal palace car
breaks down, the queen can get

00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:22.830
out and change the spark plug.

00:41:22.830 --> 00:41:25.330
Pretty cool huh?

00:41:25.330 --> 00:41:28.600
And, last of all, do you
think the queen would have

00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:33.100
in her purse, a lucky charm?

00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:34.400
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:35.700
&gt;&gt; Megan McDonald:
You guys are good.

00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:37.000
How'd you know that.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.370
I thought no way would the
queen carry a lucky charm,

00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:41.670
but she does.

00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:42.990
She always has a lucky charm.

00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:48.060
However, I couldn't find
out what her lucky charm is,

00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:51.900
so if you ever get to meet the
Queen of England, please ask her

00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:56.480
for me what is your lucky
charm so we can find out.

00:41:56.480 --> 00:42:01.740
Okay, do you, does anybody
have a question you wanted

00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:04.270
to ask today before
it's time to go?

00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:05.570

will you make anymore, books,

different books other
than Judy Moody?

00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:14.570
&gt;&gt; Megan McDonald: Yes,

00:42:14.570 --> 00:42:19.230
so the question is will I make
anymore different books other

00:42:19.230 --> 00:42:20.830
than Judy Moody.

00:42:20.830 --> 00:42:24.330
I've actually been working on
a new book for about 2 years

00:42:24.330 --> 00:42:27.510
so far that's not
about Judy Moody.

00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:30.530
And, this book is so different
because it's a fantasy,

00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:34.700
so it's totally just made
up in my imagination,

00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:38.890
but maybe someday
I'll finish it.

have a clothing line

across like a hoodie or a shirt?

I'm so glad you said

00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:49.510
that since my publisher's

to make it a math problem
so you can figure out.

out when I was 30 years old

how long have I been
writing Judy Moody books?

00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:16.090
Well, long enough that kids
who are in college now,

00:44:16.090 --> 00:44:18.100
read Judy Moody when
they were young,

00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:23.350
so the first Judy Moody
book came out in the 2000,

00:44:23.350 --> 00:44:25.640
so for about 18 years.

00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:28.330
So, actually a little
more because I had

00:44:28.330 --> 00:44:30.750
to write the Judy
Moody book for a couple

00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:34.800
of years before it came out,
so probably about 20 years

00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:39.260

Most writers don't usually
go be part of the movie,

was 11 years old and she was

from Australia and she
had red hair that was kind

00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:23.740
of messy like Judy Moody.

00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:25.210
Well, she came from Australia,

00:45:25.210 --> 00:45:28.270
and in Australia they
have a different accent

00:45:28.270 --> 00:45:32.320
than we have here, so she had
to come a couple of months early

00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:34.360
and she had to get
a dialect coach,

00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:37.730
a person who could help
her to learn to speak

00:45:37.730 --> 00:45:39.880
with an American accent.

00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:43.500
And, then by the time we started
the movie, she was really good

00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:47.050
at speaking like an
American would sound.
