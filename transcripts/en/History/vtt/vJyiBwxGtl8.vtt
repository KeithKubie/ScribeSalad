00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:02.880
Bladesmiths, welcome
to our strength test.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.170
I'm going to take
each of your blades,

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.120
and I'm going to
repeatedly and brutally

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.830
beat them into this antler.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.330
I want to see what the antler's
going to do to your blades.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:11.290
Devin, you're up first.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:12.040
You ready?

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:12.710
I'm ready.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.120
Let's do it.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.670
I came here to test myself
with an extreme challenge,

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.670
and now it's up to the test
to see if I met and exceeded

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.540
those expectations.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:24.250
Ooh!

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.540
[rock music]

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.920
Well, Devin.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.580
We got a little issue
on the edge here.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.080
Didn't so much chip
out and more rolled.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:46.080
But it stayed straight, and
the seams that you fixed

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.420
stayed together.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.250
So good job there.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.170
Thank you.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.880
Mike.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:50.880
How you feeling?

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:51.880
- Good.
- Let's do this.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:52.420
OK.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.170
I have my concerns
about the testing.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.830
My blade is much lighter
than the other two blades,

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.960
but bigger is not always better.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.290
[suspenseful music]

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:15.620
OK, Mike.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.120
Your knife did survive.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.120
But we got a few issues.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.710
You had a little bit
of a warp before.

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:21.880
Yep.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.040
Now it's a good
bend in the blade.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.580
And your blade seams
have opened up.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:29.710
So, Trevor.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.080
You look excited.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.960
I'm really critical
of my blades.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.960
I always see every
flaw, so I'm worried

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.960
about catastrophic failure.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.040
[suspenseful music]

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.920
All right, Trevor.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.500
We've got an issue.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.250
You've got quite an
extreme roll here.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.170
And you can see right
in the middle here

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.080
in that roll it started
to split as well.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.120
You had an issue
before with your sanmai

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.960
not being connected all the way.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.460
You can hear it.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.830
That's opened up more.

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.960
And there's a spot
down here too.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.960
Your handle is on
the large side,

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.170
but I like the way
you contoured it.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.670
My hand just kind
of locks into place.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.960
But the edge is
definitely an issue.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.920
But now it's time for
the sharpness test.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.250
Doug.

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.000
Well, bladesmiths, this
is the sharpness test.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.040
This is all about what
the edge of your blade

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.960
will do to these ham.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:29.710
Devin, you're up first.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:30.460
You ready for this?

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:31.170
I'm ready, sir.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.330
Let's do it.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.620
[suspenseful music]

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.960
Nice.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.460
All right, Devin.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.290
The angle you have for
this lends itself to be

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.960
a very nice slicer and chopper.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.380
You have a very
long handle here,

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.880
so I have to choke up on that.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.000
But it does come into a
curve so I can hold on to it.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.170
Overall, it will cut.

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.210
All right, Mike.

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:06.670
Time for some Canadian bacon.

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:07.750
You ready for this?

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.500
[laughs] I'm ready.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.750
[suspenseful music]

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.080
All right, Mike.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.040
Your blade does not seem
to have an edge on it.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.540
The important thing about knives
is knives were made to cut.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.750
Unfortunately, Mike,
your blade did not cut.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.000
All right, Trevor, it's time.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.750
Ready for this?

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.250
Yes, sir.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.420
The edge damage on my blade
is pretty significant,

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.170
so I'm worried my knife
might not make the cut.

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.500
[rock music]

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.120
All right, Trevor.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.460
Because you have a thinner blade
here, it took a lot of damage

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:05.880
on the strength test.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.920
But these parts right
here are razor sharp.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.880
That kind of geometry is able
to cut cleanly through the ham--

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.080
because your blade,
sir, will cut.

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.790
Thank you.

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.540
DOUG: Good job.

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.750
Bladesmiths, the judges have
given me their final decision.

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.210
It's time for one of
you to leave the forge.

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.460
Mike.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.710
Your blade didn't make the cut.

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.460
First up, thank
you for coming down

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.420
and giving a great
effort in what is

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.500
one of our hardest challenges.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.170
Coal forge, sanmai, in the sun.

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.000
All of the blades took
damage in the strength test.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.250
But your blade can't
cut, and for that reason,

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.290
we have to send you home.

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:45.960
Please surrender your blade.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.330
I got the boot.

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.620
I concentrated on keeping
a blunt edge so it

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.830
would survive the bone chop.

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.960
But I guess I kept it too blunt.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.830
I'm proud of the way I performed
while I was here, so I'm

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.420
going home without any regrets.
