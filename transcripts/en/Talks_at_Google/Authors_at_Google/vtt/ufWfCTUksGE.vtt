[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.916 --> 00:00:08.280
JASON ANDREAS: Today, we
welcome Chef Brendon Edward's

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.264
of Detroit's Corktown
hot spot, Gold Cash Gold.

00:00:11.264 --> 00:00:11.930
Has anyone been?

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:12.550
Show of hands?

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:13.567
AUDIENCE: Woo!

00:00:13.567 --> 00:00:14.650
JASON ANDREAS: Most of us.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:15.149
All right.

00:00:15.149 --> 00:00:17.730
Well let's get the other
hands up after this.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.610
Prior to Gold Cash Gold, Chef
Edwards created the original

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.710
menu at [INAUDIBLE] Standby--

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:23.211
Hands?

00:00:23.211 --> 00:00:23.710
Anyone?

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:24.220
A few?

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.540
OK-- when it opened
in 2015 and spent time

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.300
at the who's who of Detroit's
restaurants, Forest Grill,

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.430
Roast, Katoi, and [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.770
His progressive American
style combines experience

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.330
working in Michelin
star restaurants

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.859
in Chicago with his time
abroad in Mexico and Japan.

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:40.650
And we'll hear a little
bit more about that

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.074
throughout the conversation.

00:00:42.074 --> 00:00:44.490
So please welcome to Google
Detroit, Chef Brendon Edwards.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:45.957
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.310
BRENDON EDWARDS:
So yeah, I'm not

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.650
used to normally talking
in front of people.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.800
And it's been probably
since high school,

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.230
other than going
to tables and being

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.490
in a more intimate setting.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.410
But as I've been
introduced, I'm a chef.

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.560
I cook on a daily basis.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.460
I'm in a kitchen.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.930
I've been doing it
for about 18 years.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.110
And I'm just going to
keep my notes closer.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.240
But yeah, mostly,
as Jason mentioned,

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.630
I've been in the Detroit area.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.160
I have, kind of,
been a little bit

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.070
of a vagabond moving my
way in and out of the city

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.780
as I saw fit.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.490
Not to say that it
wasn't tight sometimes.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.950
You know, I saved up a bunch
of money, moved to Japan,

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.000
and then worked there
at a Michelin starred

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.505
restaurant for three months,
pretty much, straight.

00:01:45.505 --> 00:01:46.960
I worked from 7:30
in the morning

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.530
till midnight seven days a week.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.830
So did things like that.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.697
I also spent some
time in Mexico.

00:01:55.697 --> 00:01:58.030
I ended up living with a
family that owned a restaurant.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.374
So therefore, I kind of
worked in the restaurant, too.

00:02:02.374 --> 00:02:03.790
And then, I've
spent a lot of time

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.343
doing what we call in
our industry a stage.

00:02:07.343 --> 00:02:09.009
You guys would probably
know it more as,

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.100
like, an unpaid internship.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.850
And I've done that
in restaurants

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.770
in LA, and Chicago,
and a few other places.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.220
But it's kind of one of
those things that ends up

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:24.360
being a fun and interesting
perspective on how

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.030
to approach dining.

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.070
All that being said, I've
worked a lot of long hours.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.610
I've spent a lot
of time not getting

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.074
paid very much and a lot of
other fairly negative things

00:02:40.074 --> 00:02:41.490
that most people
would look at you

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.074
and go, why did you
choose to do this?

00:02:43.074 --> 00:02:45.614
And a lot of people will say,
oh, it's probably your passion.

00:02:45.614 --> 00:02:47.440
You probably love to cook.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.510
And one of the more
interesting things

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.820
is that even though I work
holidays, weekends, and I

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.660
generally, kind of, cancel
myself out of social events,

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.670
I don't love to cook, which
is probably the oddest thing

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.890
that most chefs would ever say.

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.030
JASON ANDREAS: We haven't heard
that yet out of all the chefs

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.176
there have been.

00:03:06.176 --> 00:03:06.562
[LAUGHING]

00:03:06.562 --> 00:03:07.020
BRENDON EDWARDS: Yeah.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.180
JASON ANDREAS: So that's
certainly a first so far.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.305
BRENDON EDWARDS: All right.

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.790
So I've always been
interested in cooking, though.

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.740
I think it's a very
interesting way

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.930
to interject yourself
into people's lives

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.260
without actually being
a full on part of it.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.330
Being in a serious relationship
or family or whatnot.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.280
And I always thought of it
as something interesting.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.480
Going through culinary school,
we took a food history class.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.540
And one of the quotes
that set with me

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.430
was that the onset of cooking
was the onset of civilization.

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.820
That's what, kind of, birthed
us all sitting around together

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.360
chatting and creating this
time around a warm fire

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.780
with something cooking and
nourish our brains while we

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.402
ended up evolving more.

00:03:58.402 --> 00:04:07.470
And that's where I really
love is the fact that we all

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.470
get together, and we
are hosts and guests

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.550
on a regular basis in our
homes, in restaurants,

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.700
and [INAUDIBLE] like this.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.950
You guys are my
host, and I'm a guest

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.709
trying to tell you about,
I guess, my perspective

00:04:24.709 --> 00:04:25.250
on the world.

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:30.890
JASON ANDREAS: That's one of
the big reasons, too, at Google.

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:32.473
I know we didn't
look at the cafe yet.

00:04:32.473 --> 00:04:36.690
But in all of our large
Google offices, we these open,

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.250
collaborative cafes spaces.

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.620
And it's not just to
give us free food, which

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.980
is a very nice benefit, but it's
more about the social aspect.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.870
Like, you know, let's
have meetings there.

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:46.780
Let's get together.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:47.804
Let's host, interact--

00:04:47.804 --> 00:04:48.720
BRENDON EDWARDS: Yeah.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.434
JASON ANDREAS:
--conversate around food.

00:04:50.434 --> 00:04:52.350
And food is, kind of,
what brings us together.

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.140
But that's not the key
aspect of it, necessarily.

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.080
So it sounds very similar to
the philosophy we take here.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.026
BRENDON EDWARDS: Yeah.

00:04:59.026 --> 00:05:00.900
And I think that's
what's, kind of, drawn me.

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.740
I wanted to tell you a
little bit about my times

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.240
and some of the fun
experiences I've

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.650
had being a host and a guest.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.460
As I said, I went to Mexico.

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.300
I was going to actually
go to the Culinary

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.210
Institute of America
in New York, which

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.600
is one of the finest
culinary schools in the US.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:28.155
And I went out and visited
there in August of 2001.

00:05:28.155 --> 00:05:31.270
Got to see the World Trade
Centers right before 9/11,

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.120
which was really interesting.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.120
Immediately after accepting or
getting my acceptance letter,

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.290
I bought a plane ticket
to live in Mexico.

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:43.430
So I've always been
that person that always

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.790
did my own thing, despite
my dad didn't really

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:50.010
think that was a great idea.

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:54.140
And that's where it continued.

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:58.070
I thought that maybe this
was a sign this was something

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:59.570
that I shouldn't be doing?

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:02.540
I need to go find my own path.

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.270
So I went down there and
found a nonprofit agency.

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.190
I ending up working
at a Montessori school

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:08.780
with preschool kids.

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.970
It is great.

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:12.620
It probably helped
me with my patience.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.300
I'm not a normal
chef in the kitchen

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.624
anymore the way you might
see it on TV with Gordon

00:06:17.624 --> 00:06:18.665
Ramsay and all that jazz.

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.090
A lot of my cooks have seen
me as more of a zen person.

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.580
Like, they don't see me
lose me temper very often,

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.240
not to say that I
haven't possibly

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.490
thrown some things in my life.

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:37.990
But it helped, and it was an
interesting part of my path.

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:39.910
The culture there
though was interesting

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:41.920
because I started to
actually observe cultures

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.440
and how I was received
as a host, how

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.730
I was acting as a guest.

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:51.610
I got to travel a little
bit and actually got

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:54.310
to go into houses where
they offered me things

00:06:54.310 --> 00:07:01.040
that, as an outsider,
you're told don't eat that.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.530
Don't drink that.

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:07.250
But it feels really odd to not
because they're being so kind.

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:13.190
I mean, like, we eat meat
once every two months.

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:15.440
So we slaughtered
the pig for you.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.842
And we're serving
it with lettuce.

00:07:17.842 --> 00:07:19.300
You're not supposed
to eat lettuce.

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:25.980
So obviously, you eat less
and get full a little quicker.

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:28.710
But it's an
interesting perspective

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:34.790
to have that, as a guest, I'm
trying to end up accommodating

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:37.490
my host just as my host
is probably even trying

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.870
to accommodate me.

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:43.160
The more interesting
point of view

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:48.180
was after I got
back from Mexico,

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:49.980
I ended up going
through culinary school.

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:51.870
And I decided I
loved hospitality.

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:53.230
I love serving people.

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:58.500
I loved experiencing
that moment of realizing

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.200
that you're a part of someone's
life, whether they know it

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.710
or not.

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:04.560
Like, they probably
don't know my name.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.240
But I've met many people
that I've cooked for.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.950
But they don't even know
that I cooked for them.

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:10.680
They just said, yeah, I went to
Longman &amp; Eagle and ate brunch,

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.190
and it was great.

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:13.200
I was cooking that day.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.283
I know I was because I was
there almost every day.

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:21.960
But their perspective in saying
like, oh, I had a great time

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.010
kept me going.

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:25.410
So after I moved
back from Japan,

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:27.180
I went through culinary
school, and that

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:28.394
was going to be my passion.

00:08:28.394 --> 00:08:29.310
I was going to commit.

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:30.510
I was going to do it.

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:32.730
I was going to become a
really, really good cook.

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:38.309
And then, I was going to become
the best host I could be.

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:41.309
And I ended up, going
through culinary school,

00:08:41.309 --> 00:08:42.877
I worked for Brian Poulsen.

00:08:42.877 --> 00:08:45.210
Opened up Forest Grill, which
is right around the corner

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:46.990
from here.

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:51.850
I was the first AM
sous chef there.

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:52.790
I worked a lot.

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:53.780
I loved it.

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:56.420
Every time I saw a
chef jot down a note,

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:58.100
I took notes on his notes.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:00.410
And I went home and I
researched so I could figure out

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:03.890
how to make polenta because I
had never made polenta before.

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:06.440
So I wanted to know everything.

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.940
And this was my way of trying
to be the best host I can.

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:13.150
And I realized I started--

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:16.840
in looking back on
my time and spending

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:20.369
time with the culture of
Mexico and the people there--

00:09:20.369 --> 00:09:22.660
I realized I was starting to
become part of the culture

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:24.190
here.

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:26.320
But I was still more
interested in making sure

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:30.530
that I could see not only the
culture here but that culture

00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:33.780
elsewhere, and how to actually
pull that into our culture

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:35.660
because, as
Americans, we've kind

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:37.670
of adopted lots of cultures.

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:42.230
And those cultures have
become intrinsically us.

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:43.855
People from all
over the world, we

00:09:43.855 --> 00:09:45.230
come here and
bring our cuisines,

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:52.120
and we bring everything we are.

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:54.640
And then, we adapt it with
all the people we're around.

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.260
Italian food, if
you go to Italy,

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.990
isn't the same here
as it is in Italy.

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:04.200
I think if anyone has been to
Italy, you'll realize that.

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:07.430
So I decided I'd go as far
away from French cuisine

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:10.020
and American everything
I possibly could.

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:14.180
So I thought about how
isolated Japan was.

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:15.890
So I traveled to Japan.

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:17.400
And I went there.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:25.060
I studied everyday, Japanese,
for six months before I left.

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:26.210
I did five days a week.

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:27.770
I did four hours a day.

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:28.760
I bought Rosetta Stone.

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.140
I bought Japanese for Dummies.

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:31.160
All those things
because I didn't

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:32.690
want to seem like I
was stupid the moment

00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:33.565
I walked in the door.

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:40.259
That being said, I walked
up to this Michelin two

00:10:40.259 --> 00:10:41.050
starred restaurant.

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:43.220
It's currently
Michelin three starred.

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:47.870
A place called Kichisen
with Chef Yoshimi Tanigawa.

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:51.020
And he came down
befitting of what

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:54.050
you can imagine Japanese men--

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:56.080
well you can imagine Japan.

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.840
He came down wearing a
monochromatic yellow jumpsuit

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:03.280
at 8 o'clock in the morning,
happy, and ready to go.

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:06.380
I think he was like
56 or 57 at the time

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:10.085
and had more energy than
any person I can imagine

00:11:10.085 --> 00:11:11.710
at 8 o'clock in the
morning, especially

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:14.450
after I realized the hours
that he was putting in.

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:16.312
And immediately-- I had
a translator there--

00:11:16.312 --> 00:11:17.770
he started talking
to me because he

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:19.112
knew I was studying Japanese.

00:11:19.112 --> 00:11:21.070
And I could tell he was
talking a little slower

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:24.300
and things like that.

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:28.770
I didn't understand a single
word he said until he said,

00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:30.520
you understand that?

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.852
I felt horrible.

00:11:32.852 --> 00:11:34.060
I studied the wrong language.

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:35.570
I don't know what happened.

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:37.570
But my time with him was
also really interesting

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:41.710
because it's completely devoid
of a lot of the cultural norms

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:43.770
that we have and the
cultural norms that I

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:47.100
had studied of Western culture.

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:50.520
He does a style
cooking called keisuke,

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:57.970
which is paired with
their tea ceremony, which

00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:00.979
I got to study it with a
bunch of 40-year-old women

00:12:00.979 --> 00:12:02.520
that giggled like
middle school girls

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:06.750
the entire time, every
Wednesday for three hours.

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:09.420
That being said, I got to
sit on my knees for about two

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:10.320
of those hours.

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:13.830
And then, they asked me to
gracefully get up all the time.

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:20.160
That doesn't work, even
in a 27-year-olds body.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.580
But I spent some time with
him, and it was really

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:27.690
amazing what he was as a host.

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:29.630
I kind of called myself
a guy [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:33.530
because he would bring me
everywhere he would go.

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:38.260
He loved having me there and
wanted to show me everything.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:39.180
I worked for free.

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:42.410
That being said, I
lived in a dormitory

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:45.620
with a few other
apprentices on a bunk bed.

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:48.150
My top bunk was the kitchen.

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:51.280
So it was like a rice cooker
and an induction burner.

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:52.040
That was about it.

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.560
But he would bring me
everywhere he'd go.

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.750
There's one of my
favorite times,

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:00.910
which I didn't even
understand what was happening,

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:03.170
is he would tell me
to go get dressed up.

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:05.260
He told me to put
on a tuxedo, which

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.300
I took as I didn't
bring a tuxedo,

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:11.020
so I'm going to wear a button up
shirt, and a belt, and slacks,

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:14.226
and the nicest shoes I have.

00:13:14.226 --> 00:13:15.850
And he did this every
time we went out.

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:19.930
And so he told me to go get
dressed up in my tuxedo.

00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:23.020
And I ran across to the
dormitory, came back,

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:24.550
and he was dressed up.

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:25.525
And he really loved--

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:30.850
what's his name?

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:34.220
The designer that has all
the tattoo print on it.

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:35.230
Christian?

00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:36.700
JASON ANDREAS: Audigier?

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:37.680
BRENDON EDWARDS: No.

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:39.376
A different one.

00:13:39.376 --> 00:13:40.230
AUDIENCE: Ed Hardy?

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:40.940
BRENDON EDWARDS: Ed Hardy.

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:41.580
[LAUGHING]

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:44.680
Christian is the-- yeah, sorry.

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:45.360
So Ed Hardy.

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:46.600
He loved Ed Hardy.

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:47.770
And he wore all Ed Hardy.

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:50.290
And we talked about it on
that drive that I remember.

00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:52.270
He told me about how
the hat he was wearing

00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:53.714
was Ed Hardy and shoes.

00:13:53.714 --> 00:13:55.130
JASON ANDREAS:
What year was this?

00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:55.900
The early 2000s?

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:56.860
BRENDON EDWARDS: This was 2010.

00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:57.540
JASON ANDREAS: Oh.

00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:58.080
BRENDON EDWARDS: Yep.

00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.650
JASON ANDREAS: So a little bit
late for the Ed Hardy trend,

00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:00.660
but that's OK.

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:02.940
BRENDON EDWARDS: Yeah.

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:05.440
But head to toe, all the
way down to his underwear,

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:08.380
which he did point out that he
was wearing Ed Hardy underwear.

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:09.880
And we're driving
through, and we're

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:14.020
talking about the little
amount that we can talk.

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:16.030
And then, we stop.

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:18.590
And he pulls and gets
into a parking spot.

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:20.695
And I had my
Nintendo DS with me.

00:14:20.695 --> 00:14:22.320
And just in case I
needed to translate,

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.403
there's was a program on
there that I can actually

00:14:24.403 --> 00:14:26.890
write Kanji or
Japanese characters,

00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:32.220
and it would translate it
into what I need to know.

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:35.010
And as he's getting out, I
opened the door to get out.

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:36.750
And he goes no, no, no.

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:37.760
Chotto matte.

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:39.780
I go, all right.

00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:41.450
That means wait.

00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:42.724
And then, I close the door.

00:14:42.724 --> 00:14:43.640
And I see him get out.

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:45.080
And he goes into this place.

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:46.620
I don't know what he's doing.

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:49.751
Then I realize he's
getting a haircut.

00:14:49.751 --> 00:14:51.140
And I'm just waiting in the car.

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:51.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:52.520
All right.

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:53.435
That's fine.

00:14:53.435 --> 00:14:54.710
Then, he gets back in the car.

00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:56.030
And we continue
our conversation.

00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:57.050
Start driving around again.

00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:58.660
And I thought maybe we're
going to the market.

00:14:58.660 --> 00:14:59.645
Maybe he's going to
show me something.

00:14:59.645 --> 00:15:01.010
Maybe he was going to
take me out for lunch.

00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:01.865
I'm not sure.

00:15:01.865 --> 00:15:04.004
And then, we just pull
back up to the restaurant.

00:15:04.004 --> 00:15:05.170
And he says, go get dressed.

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:05.920
Be ready for work.

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:06.659
It.

00:15:06.659 --> 00:15:07.700
He took me on a car ride.

00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:11.870
I was like, I feel like a pet.

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:12.560
This is amazing.

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:15.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:19.820
But we had lots of fun
adventures like that.

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:23.270
He took me on a run once
just to go see something.

00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:25.730
I got to meet the yakuza
that came up to his door

00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:30.650
with a Buddhist monk that
drove the yakuza around.

00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:32.330
But he always kept
me by his side

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:35.860
because he always
loved hosting me.

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:41.200
And me, as a guest, I tried
my best to be a good guest.

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:44.290
Of which turns into this
story, which is on our run

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:48.790
one day where he told me to
get dressed up in a tuxedo,

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:54.790
and then he was in a, once
again, monochromatic jumpsuit,

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:56.000
and we went on a run.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.940
And it was, like,
a four mile run.

00:15:57.940 --> 00:15:59.440
And I was running
in dress shoes.

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:01.210
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:03.700
And as we were
running, he stopped,

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:04.930
and he gave me a camera.

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:07.270
And he says, run up there.

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:08.500
Take a photo of me.

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:09.520
I said, all right.

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.200
So I ran up ahead
of him a little bit.

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.330
And he was an older man.

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:14.530
He was jogging, you know.

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:16.690
I took a photo as he
was running by me.

00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:18.640
And then, he stops, and
we look at the photo.

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:20.340
And he says, wow, that's great.

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:21.550
And I go, all right.

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:22.550
There you go.

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:25.660
He says, take another one.

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:27.370
That happened for
all four miles.

00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:29.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:32.860
And the only way I could
think of to be a good guest

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:35.470
was to go with it.

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:38.080
So I started
pretending like this

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.430
was a photo shoot in my head.

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:41.110
I'm like, I can't
be embarrassed.

00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:44.200
There's Japanese men in
full grown suits running

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:45.790
so they can be early to a bus.

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:47.660
Not on time, but early.

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:49.300
That's amazing.

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:52.090
I can totally run down,
and lay on the ground,

00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:56.830
and climb up trees in
a button up shirt just

00:16:56.830 --> 00:16:59.390
to make this guy
happy to make it seem

00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:01.160
like I'm being a good guess.

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:02.440
And I did that.

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:06.099
And I laid down, and as
he ran upstairs in almost

00:17:06.099 --> 00:17:09.609
like a Rocky Balboa fashion,
I took photos of him

00:17:09.609 --> 00:17:14.030
from trees, from the
ground, and I probably

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:16.970
have around 150 photos over
the course of four miles.

00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:22.049
And when we got back, he was
bragging to a translator.

00:17:22.049 --> 00:17:26.220
And he was like, oh, he's so
[INAUDIBLE], like energetic.

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:28.500
He's like, were you
in the military?

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:29.490
No.

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:31.020
I was never in the military.

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:33.194
I just had no idea what
else to do because you

00:17:33.194 --> 00:17:35.830
kept asking me to take photos.

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:37.655
JASON ANDREAS: Sounds
like you were, maybe,

00:17:37.655 --> 00:17:39.905
on a hidden camera Japanese
game show, in my opinion.

00:17:39.905 --> 00:17:41.052
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:41.052 --> 00:17:42.260
I want to check the internet.

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:43.635
You might be out
there somewhere.

00:17:43.635 --> 00:17:44.357
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:44.357 --> 00:17:46.440
BRENDON EDWARDS: I'll put
that in your guys' boat.

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:47.280
You are Google.

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.190
I figure if anyone's
gonna find it--

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:49.380
JASON ANDREAS: I'll do
some research after this.

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:50.296
BRENDON EDWARDS: Yeah.

00:17:50.296 --> 00:17:52.284
JASON ANDREAS: I can,
maybe, find some clips.

00:17:52.284 --> 00:17:54.270
BRENDON EDWARDS:
But anyway, that's

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:57.390
my initial impression of being
a host and being a guest.

00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:59.670
And I came back to the
US with a perspective

00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:04.645
on a few different cultures
and how they react.

00:18:04.645 --> 00:18:06.270
And I think it's
really interesting now

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:09.260
that I have that perspective.

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.580
I deal with hundreds
of people a day

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:15.000
coming in, sitting down, eating.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.920
Sometimes they don't
like what they eat.

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:19.440
So how do you do that?

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:20.880
How do you compensate?

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:24.760
How do you work with
them, as a host?

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:27.880
And my usual thing is I want to
be as good of a host as I can.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:30.660
So I translate that, and
I say, you don't like.

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:32.040
I'll get you something else.

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:33.535
I won't charge you for that.

00:18:33.535 --> 00:18:34.410
I'll get you dessert.

00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:37.475
I will buy you a
drink because if it

00:18:37.475 --> 00:18:41.120
was someone in your
house, what would you do?

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:46.046
And then, also comes the duality
of how are they a good guest?

00:18:46.046 --> 00:18:49.520
At Gold Cash Gold,
this is fairly telling,

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:52.337
but I'm going to tell it anyway.

00:18:52.337 --> 00:18:54.420
I had a group of, like,
20-year-old girls come in.

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:56.860
It was 10 of them
on a Friday night.

00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:58.350
8 o'clock.

00:18:58.350 --> 00:18:59.310
And they all came in.

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:00.810
They seemed like they
were good guests.

00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:01.643
Everything was fine.

00:19:01.643 --> 00:19:02.910
They all ordered sandwiches.

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:05.340
Burgers and chicken sandwiches.

00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:07.410
Every single one of them
got it and sent it back

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:09.180
to the kitchen.

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:10.874
I was like, aw
man, what's wrong?

00:19:10.874 --> 00:19:12.540
All of a sudden, I
see all these servers

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:13.990
coming back to the kitchen.

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:15.810
This is a reverse flow.

00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:19.330
I'm nervous, at this moment.

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:20.490
They didn't not like them.

00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:23.050
They just wanted
them cut in half.

00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:24.122
All 10 of them.

00:19:24.122 --> 00:19:25.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:27.820
Now on a Friday
night, as a chef,

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:32.880
I am a composed chef,
most of the time.

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:36.350
But in certain moments, it's
hard to hold your composure.

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:39.740
I cut all of those sandwiches
in half with a cleaver

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:42.120
because I was like I
have more food coming out

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:43.610
and more food coming this way.

00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:48.230
This feels not good.

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:50.390
And I think this was
the question that I've

00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:55.430
started to push upon
myself, and diners,

00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:58.550
and also see how America
is actually relating to it

00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:00.830
in terms of how do we walk in.

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:02.592
And how do we be a guest?

00:20:02.592 --> 00:20:04.400
How do I be a better host?

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:07.400
And I think America's kind of
translating that and pushing it

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:08.300
forward.

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:11.830
We're creating our own identity.

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:17.950
Cultures came in and changed
the way we work with food.

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:21.190
And they came in, usually
coming from a lesser,

00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:24.162
into what America is,
which is an abundance.

00:20:24.162 --> 00:20:26.620
And that's actually a really
beautiful thing about America.

00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:28.170
Our quality started to diminish.

00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:32.770
If you look at Folgers and
the major coffee companies

00:20:32.770 --> 00:20:35.290
in World War II, they
actually changed their beans

00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:39.190
from Arabica to the
lesser bean, which I can't

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:40.750
remember the name of right now.

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:42.250
But they changed their beans.

00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:44.320
And if you actually
check out their sales,

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:46.900
their sales
actually-- by person--

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:49.360
less people start
drinking coffee

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:51.820
because they started caring
less about the quality of what

00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:54.500
they're doing.

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:56.960
And therefore, their
product suffered.

00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:59.090
That being said, they're
still a major preparer

00:20:59.090 --> 00:21:01.490
of coffee goods
and all that jazz.

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:04.880
You can still buy them in
every store that you can find.

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:08.070
But I don't want to
deal with volume.

00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:10.520
I want to deal with quality
because my thought is

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.110
that I want to be a host.

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:16.670
I want to be your person for
the moment where you walk in,

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:19.070
and you feel good about
the day that you came.

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:19.925
Your first date.

00:21:19.925 --> 00:21:20.770
Your second date.

00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:22.270
Your anniversary.

00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:25.390
You're meeting with friends.

00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:28.010
And that's what I do
on a regular basis.

00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:31.834
And you can see that is changing
with Selden Standard that

00:21:31.834 --> 00:21:34.250
opened up in Detroit, which,
hopefully, you've gone there,

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:39.270
or Chartreuse, or Mabel Gray,
and numerous other chefs.

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:42.250
Rose's Fine Foods.

00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:45.760
They all fit their
own way of hosting.

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:51.340
And they're all trying to do
better in their communities

00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:53.620
and for you, as guests,
when you go there.

00:21:56.250 --> 00:22:00.520
And it's my goal to
keep pushing that.

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:04.265
And I think, also, it's my goal
to start teaching guests how

00:22:04.265 --> 00:22:08.340
to be guests too because I
think that's an important part.

00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:11.720
It's a relationship when
you walk into a restaurant.

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:13.200
And it's not always an easy one.

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:15.600
Often, it's tumultuous.

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:19.395
And therein lies my
general thoughts.

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:27.030
I stopped looking at
my notes awhile ago.

00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:28.900
How are we looking on time?

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:29.170
JASON ANDREAS: We're good.

00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:31.295
I was going to ask a question
about that last point

00:22:31.295 --> 00:22:33.939
that you made in
terms of expectations

00:22:33.939 --> 00:22:35.230
around hosts and guests, right.

00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:37.780
So I feel like Detroit
is carving out, kind of,

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:40.110
a unique ecosystem.

00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:42.550
And you've worked a lot
in Chicago, as well.

00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:48.100
Both typical standard,
Midwest, American cities

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:51.370
where you've got the
Midwest hospitality overall.

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:53.650
Have you spent time
on either coast?

00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:58.270
New York, Boston,
D.C, or west coast?

00:22:58.270 --> 00:22:59.050
San Francisco?

00:22:59.050 --> 00:22:59.680
L.A?

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:03.490
And how does the expectation
of the guest host

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:07.240
differ from the core
Midwest type ecosystem

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:09.070
to one of the coasts
where things are maybe

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:11.380
a little bit more rigid
on the east coast or maybe

00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:13.380
a little bit more laid
back on the west coast?

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:14.296
BRENDON EDWARDS: Yeah.

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:20.650
Once again, if you
go to Europe, you'll

00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:24.750
see their styles of hospitality.

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:29.180
Their general food, stuff
they serve, all changes.

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:32.260
And I think I see four
distinct regions--

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:34.510
and there probably
is a lot more--

00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:37.000
but you see the east coast,
the west coast, the Midwest,

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.250
and then the south.

00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:41.390
My dad's actually
from South Carolina.

00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:45.880
So I spent a decent amount
of time in the south.

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:49.220
My sister lives in L.A.
So I got to actually work.

00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:51.250
I spent two months out there.

00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:54.580
And then, I just
staged at restaurants.

00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:58.210
So I was a babysitter to
my niece for a while, which

00:23:58.210 --> 00:23:59.540
was really great.

00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:01.570
And then, I would
just, occasionally,

00:24:01.570 --> 00:24:04.780
relieve myself of them having
to think about me because I

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:07.030
thought I was a burden.

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:09.670
So I'd just go and work at,
like, Animal and whatnot,

00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:14.020
which are just restaurants
I really wanted to go to.

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:20.150
And I think there's a lot more
expectations on the east coast,

00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:23.500
from my understanding from
cooks I've worked with.

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:25.610
As all industries
are, we're kind of

00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:29.270
like this really small
community that you

00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:31.724
think is really
big because there's

00:24:31.724 --> 00:24:33.890
thousands and thousands and
thousands of restaurants

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:35.540
across the US.

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:37.520
But there's not many
cities in the US

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:39.890
that I don't know
a cook or a chef

00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:42.245
because we've all,
kind of, gone around.

00:24:42.245 --> 00:24:44.150
it's the beauty to cooking.

00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:47.645
I can go anywhere, and cook
somewhere, and learn something,

00:24:47.645 --> 00:24:48.770
and a lot of cooks do that.

00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:58.250
My perspective on L.A, which
isn't quite west coast--

00:24:58.250 --> 00:25:01.040
meaning it's a little
different from Portland to L.A,

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:07.640
and then going down to San Diego
but very specifically on L.A--

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:15.630
I feel like it was a
type of hospitality where

00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:20.880
the host isn't as important
as the other guests, not even

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:22.090
on an equal playing field.

00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:30.250
But a lot of places were a place
where you'd go more to be seen

00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:33.130
and to eat and drink
the things that

00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:34.600
were popular to eat and drink.

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:38.211
I think L.A is changing
though, since I've been.

00:25:38.211 --> 00:25:39.835
The Midwest-- I even
feel like Chicago,

00:25:39.835 --> 00:25:42.490
even though it has a
Midwest personality--

00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:49.080
there's still a lot of
east coast drive behind it

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:53.010
because New York, Austin,
those sort of places,

00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:56.968
you walk into the kitchens,
they're really small.

00:25:56.968 --> 00:25:59.000
At Longman &amp; Eagle, the
area that I prepped,

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.260
I couldn't even stand up.

00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:01.580
I'm six foot tall.

00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:06.112
So I actually, kind
of, developed a stance.

00:26:06.112 --> 00:26:07.070
I didn't bend my knees.

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:09.200
I just, sort of,
spread my feet out.

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:12.500
And then, all the cooks around
me also did that because if you

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:15.980
were above 5'10, you'd probably
hit your head on a pipe

00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:17.920
downstairs.

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:23.180
A couple of people actually
knocked themselves out in rush.

00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:25.870
But yeah, I feel
like the east coast

00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:30.860
is a little bit more driven,
a little bit more competitive.

00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:33.170
The Midwest tends to
be a little bit more--

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:37.740
and very specifically, Detroit--

00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:40.428
tends to be more
community driven.

00:26:40.428 --> 00:26:42.300
JASON ANDREAS: Yeah, for sure.

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:43.758
BRENDON EDWARDS:
You can definitely

00:26:43.758 --> 00:26:46.770
see that I had friends
that opened up Grey Ghost.

00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:48.180
You guys talked to John.

00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:48.600
JASON ANDREAS: Yeah.

00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:49.740
John was in a couple weeks ago.

00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:50.656
BRENDON EDWARDS: Yeah.

00:26:50.656 --> 00:26:55.790
And he called me up
maybe a week ago now.

00:26:55.790 --> 00:27:00.310
And he just had questions for
me of purveyors, who to ask.

00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:04.680
And in general chef culture, you
don't give away your secrets.

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:06.300
But in Detroit,
it's like, oh, where

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:08.730
do you find some odd thing
that you normally can't find,

00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:11.430
such as caul fat,
or tonka beans,

00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:16.784
or just some culinary oddity
that you don't normally see?

00:27:16.784 --> 00:27:17.700
And it's hard to find.

00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:19.241
You won't find it
in a grocery store.

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:23.237
Where can I get this?

00:27:23.237 --> 00:27:24.070
JASON ANDREAS: Sure.

00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:28.820
BRENDON EDWARDS: And
you share those things.

00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:30.500
We share each other's kitchens.

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:33.380
Opening up Standby,
I had Chef Joe,

00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:35.880
who is part of Grey
Ghost working at Standby.

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:37.490
I had Kate Williams
in my kitchen.

00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:40.910
I had Brian Wong from
Peterborough in my kitchen.

00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:43.970
And they were all
technically working

00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:47.460
at an hourly wage for me.

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:49.030
Most chefs wouldn't
allow other chefs

00:27:49.030 --> 00:27:53.170
to just do that so freely.

00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:57.340
JASON ANDREAS: We had Chef
James Rigato in from Mabel Gray

00:27:57.340 --> 00:27:58.675
a couple weeks ago.

00:27:58.675 --> 00:28:00.190
And you know, he
does a lot of stuff

00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:02.356
at Mabel Gray where he
brings in his favorite chefs.

00:28:02.356 --> 00:28:04.630
He's like, I like this
person's restaurant.

00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:07.290
I'm going to have them come
in and guest chef for a couple

00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:07.790
days.

00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:11.020
And you don't hear about that
too often outside of Detroit.

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:13.940
I feel like that's fairly
unique to this type of community

00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:14.710
atmosphere.

00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:15.850
It does happen, obviously.

00:28:15.850 --> 00:28:18.100
But it's a lot more
official than other places

00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:20.410
where something
like Next Chicago

00:28:20.410 --> 00:28:24.730
brings in a guest chef for
a three month rotation.

00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:26.920
Whereas, this is maybe
one night you go cook

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.690
at Mabel Gray for a few hours.

00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:31.950
And it's kind of not
really heavily publicized.

00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:34.530
It's more just, hey,
let's create a community

00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:36.592
in this Detroit ecosystem.

00:28:36.592 --> 00:28:38.050
Have a little fun
with it more than

00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:40.280
being something a little
more rigid and official.

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:41.196
BRENDON EDWARDS: Yeah.

00:28:41.196 --> 00:28:44.590
And I think of all things
that Detroit has going for it,

00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:48.070
I did my first pop
up here in 2009.

00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:49.450
It's called The Breakfast Club.

00:28:49.450 --> 00:28:53.620
It started at midnight
in Rush Park, Detroit.

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:56.860
And it ended at 5:00 AM.

00:28:56.860 --> 00:29:00.280
I had Andy Holiday from
Selden as, sort of,

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:02.025
my stand in sous chef.

00:29:02.025 --> 00:29:04.360
Not that he was my sous chef,
but I made all this food,

00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:06.520
and then he was helping
me plate everything.

00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:10.780
We had 400 people walk in the
door starting at midnight.

00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:14.260
And it was just this thing
that had been bubbling.

00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:16.300
And I feel like if
anything Detroit has,

00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:21.830
it's starting this birthplace
of this cooperative nature

00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:24.765
in the culinary industry.

00:29:24.765 --> 00:29:26.640
And I think there's lots
of reasons for that,

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:28.973
but I think that that's one
of the most beautiful things

00:29:28.973 --> 00:29:31.234
that's always drawn
me back to Detroit.

00:29:31.234 --> 00:29:32.900
I mean, I've left and
come back at least

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:33.890
half a dozen times now.

00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:38.180
And every time-- actually,
I grew up with James Rigato.

00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:40.650
So we both went to
Howell High School.

00:29:40.650 --> 00:29:42.350
We were in the same art class.

00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:44.524
So small world.

00:29:44.524 --> 00:29:46.190
JASON ANDREAS: You
may want to check out

00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:47.190
the talk he did with us.

00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:48.980
He wasn't very kind
to the city of Howell.

00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:51.625
So we had to put a little
disclaimer on there.

00:29:51.625 --> 00:29:52.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:52.370 --> 00:29:53.270
He didn't mention
you in particular.

00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:54.470
But Howell, in
general, he said he

00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:55.845
was happy to get
away from Howell

00:29:55.845 --> 00:29:57.780
and spend more time
traveling, as well.

00:29:57.780 --> 00:29:59.610
So check it out next
time you get a chance.

00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:00.530
BRENDON EDWARDS: Yeah.

00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:01.450
JASON ANDREAS: I was
going to ask you too.

00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:03.510
And then, if anyone
else has any questions,

00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:04.810
feel free to raise your hand.

00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:06.839
We'll get you a microphone.

00:30:06.839 --> 00:30:08.630
We asked this question
of all of our chefs.

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:13.130
And we've gotten a lot of, I
guess, semi mixed responses

00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:14.090
but all very similar.

00:30:14.090 --> 00:30:16.010
So obviously, you're
here at Google.

00:30:16.010 --> 00:30:20.390
We talk about expectations of
hosts and chefs at restaurants.

00:30:20.390 --> 00:30:22.504
And then, you play
the technology layer

00:30:22.504 --> 00:30:23.420
on top of that, right.

00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:26.360
So you've got things
these days like Yelp

00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:31.130
where the technology of Yelp
and the immediacy of information

00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:35.316
and feedback has really changed
expectations from, both,

00:30:35.316 --> 00:30:37.940
the host perspective in terms of
how they have to host somebody

00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:40.070
who can put a bad
review out, literally,

00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:44.000
in real time if their
10 sandwiches are cut

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.080
in half in the right way versus
guests who now have higher

00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:50.120
expectations because
of what they've read

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:53.145
from other folks who
have been patrons

00:30:53.145 --> 00:30:54.770
of the restaurant
and things like that.

00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:58.760
How do you view the
merge of technology

00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:01.652
and this kind of
host guest ecosystem

00:31:01.652 --> 00:31:02.985
that you've been chatting about.

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:07.670
BRENDON EDWARDS: I
think there's a lot

00:31:07.670 --> 00:31:10.160
to be said about the
immediacy of being

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:13.600
able to review and criticize.

00:31:16.875 --> 00:31:18.500
I usually try and
spend a decent amount

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:22.520
of time in the dining room
just talking to guests

00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:23.990
and seeing how
they are because I

00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:26.073
think that's one of those
things that's important.

00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:31.660
You do need to keep that
door open to say like, hey, I

00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:34.600
don't like this
or, hey, this isn't

00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:43.070
what I expected because my job
and our job in the hospitality

00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:47.420
industry is figuring out what
you want as best as we can.

00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:51.140
But we have moments
to figure that out,

00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:54.890
and then to do it in such a
way that you don't notice it

00:31:54.890 --> 00:31:56.750
because my thought
of hospitality

00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:58.730
oftentimes is kind of magical.

00:31:58.730 --> 00:32:00.920
You walk into a restaurant.

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:04.820
You get your piece of
paper set before you.

00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:07.850
If you go to Moto, which
isn't open anymore,

00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:10.124
you could have actually
eaten it, as well.

00:32:10.124 --> 00:32:12.020
[LAUGHING]

00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:14.540
But then, you just point
to something on the menu,

00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:16.730
and you say I want that.

00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:19.410
And magically, it comes out.

00:32:19.410 --> 00:32:23.210
Hopefully, the way
you expect or better.

00:32:23.210 --> 00:32:25.940
So I'd actually spend
time with people.

00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:28.430
I think that's something
that we're lacking.

00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:31.040
And I think, once
again, in the reverse,

00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:34.010
people aren't open to
actually right then

00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:36.550
and there saying
like, hey, actually,

00:32:36.550 --> 00:32:38.740
this drink is too bitter.

00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:41.420
It's like, oh, well you
chose a vieux carre.

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:43.010
It's kind of a bitter drink.

00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:46.760
Or you don't like campari,
probably don't get a negroni.

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:52.810
And that discussion needs
to actually be happening.

00:32:52.810 --> 00:32:55.060
Just like any good
relationship, whether it's

00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:57.580
with your mom and
dad, your siblings,

00:32:57.580 --> 00:33:01.720
or a significant other,
you need to be talking.

00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:06.770
And I think Yelp kind of
masks that, more or less.

00:33:06.770 --> 00:33:09.380
It's the ability to kind
of hide behind something

00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:13.340
without actually engaging
in a real conversation.

00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:15.830
That being said, I've
read Yelp reviews

00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:19.160
on the food I've done,
the places I've worked,

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:21.800
and I've been very
sympathetic to them, as well.

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:25.100
Or maybe a better term would
be empathetic because knowing

00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:28.560
that there are
times where we fail.

00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:32.467
And I feel bad that we fail
as a general community.

00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:41.780
And that's totally
your right to do that.

00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:43.890
If you sit down--

00:33:43.890 --> 00:33:47.720
I know I did this once at a
California Pizza Kitchen--

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:51.170
I sat down, and it became
almost a game to me

00:33:51.170 --> 00:33:54.020
to see how long it was going
to be before someone actually

00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:55.820
acknowledged me.

00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:58.400
And initially it was
like, oh, five minutes.

00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:00.230
I mean, it's kind of long.

00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:01.625
Seven.

00:34:01.625 --> 00:34:02.720
10.

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.160
Now this is fun.

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:06.750
Like, I think I need to get
a free meal out of this.

00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:09.520
Like, it took 22 minutes
when I went there.

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:10.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:10.150 --> 00:34:12.800
And I watched
servers and things.

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:14.800
And that's not right.

00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:19.190
There is a thing of you
can't actually be wrong.

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:20.449
And you do deserve a voice.

00:34:23.050 --> 00:34:25.080
But there should be
a discussion too.

00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:26.090
JASON ANDREAS: Yep.

00:34:26.090 --> 00:34:27.100
BRENDON EDWARDS:
So when I did that

00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:29.516
at California Pizza Kitchen,
I didn't write a Yelp review.

00:34:29.516 --> 00:34:32.590
But I did mention it to the
manager and say, like, hey,

00:34:32.590 --> 00:34:34.780
this wasn't quite right.

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:36.940
I do do this for
a living, as well.

00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:38.717
But you should
probably watch that.

00:34:38.717 --> 00:34:39.550
JASON ANDREAS: Yeah.

00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:40.633
BRENDON EDWARDS: You know?

00:34:40.633 --> 00:34:44.660
JASON ANDREAS: Well I think the
consensus has been conversation

00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:46.670
and two way feedback is good.

00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:51.550
But hiding behind technology
and having the courage

00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:55.417
to Yelp it out to
all of your friends

00:34:55.417 --> 00:34:57.250
as you're sitting there,
but not the courage

00:34:57.250 --> 00:34:59.470
to say something to
the waiter or waitress,

00:34:59.470 --> 00:35:01.930
or to ask to speak with the
chef is not quite the right way

00:35:01.930 --> 00:35:02.630
to go about it.

00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:04.629
So I think we've got a
long way to go with that.

00:35:04.629 --> 00:35:06.580
But I think it
certainly provides

00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:08.616
some valuable feedback,
in some cases,

00:35:08.616 --> 00:35:11.010
is the consensus we've
heard around the block.

00:35:11.010 --> 00:35:11.420
BRENDON EDWARDS: I think--

00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:11.680
JASON ANDREAS: Oh, I'm sorry.

00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:12.460
Go ahead.

00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:13.370
BRENDON EDWARDS: One
other note on that.

00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:14.110
JASON ANDREAS: Yeah, sure.

00:35:14.110 --> 00:35:15.485
BRENDON EDWARDS:
Appropriate ways

00:35:15.485 --> 00:35:17.750
to handle those situations,
if it doesn't get solved

00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:20.410
at the establishment with
you talking to someone

00:35:20.410 --> 00:35:24.040
or you don't feel comfortable
saying it, send an email,

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:26.390
as in a nonpublic forum.

00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:29.757
And if they still are ignoring
you, please, post the Yelp.

00:35:29.757 --> 00:35:31.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:33.110
Because I know even on things--

00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:38.540
and proper criticism, not
like I didn't like it.

00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:41.570
I had someone actually
tell me that they

00:35:41.570 --> 00:35:47.670
didn't like something,
and what they had ordered

00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:50.020
was mushroom based.

00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:51.655
And they said, I don't like it.

00:35:51.655 --> 00:35:53.884
I'm like, oh, what's wrong?

00:35:53.884 --> 00:35:56.050
Well they didn't tell me
this until after they left,

00:35:56.050 --> 00:35:56.619
by the way.

00:35:56.619 --> 00:35:57.910
So they said, I didn't like it.

00:35:57.910 --> 00:35:59.710
I said, what's wrong?

00:35:59.710 --> 00:36:03.490
It was like, well, I ate
it, and it just wasn't good.

00:36:03.490 --> 00:36:05.045
I don't understand
what you mean.

00:36:05.045 --> 00:36:07.420
Can you explain, like, how do
I make this better for you?

00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:09.860
And they said, I
don't like mushrooms.

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:11.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:14.270
And I just, kind of, was like,
I don't know how to fix that.

00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:15.207
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:15.207 --> 00:36:16.790
I mean, that's like
I would like the--

00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:17.070
JASON ANDREAS: It's a tough one.

00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:18.140
BRENDON EDWARDS: I would
like the filet mignon,

00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:19.130
but I don't like beef.

00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:20.420
Is it all right?

00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:24.110
No, you're not gonna like it.

00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:29.270
So there needs to be criticism
with words and an explanation

00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:32.720
of this was too salty
or this was, you know,

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:34.790
certain things that
we do mess up on.

00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:37.920
It's a hard skill
to understand how

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:41.960
to actually season something
with salt properly every time,

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:44.420
especially when I
have fish coming

00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:47.480
in from two different oceans
that has a different salinity

00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:50.330
content that you have to season
a halibut different than you

00:36:50.330 --> 00:36:54.260
season a skate wing different
than you season a local salmon

00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:56.510
that's farm raised or
something like that.

00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:58.760
So there's things like that
that are really difficult.

00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:00.590
And it's hard for
a cook to learn,

00:37:00.590 --> 00:37:02.270
and you should
mention that, and be

00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:04.250
specific about your complaints.

00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:05.280
JASON ANDREAS: I think
the proper way to salt

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:06.050
is like this, right?

00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:06.860
Like the salt guy?

00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:07.190
BRENDON EDWARDS: You're right.

00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:07.690
Yeah.

00:37:07.690 --> 00:37:10.404
JASON ANDREAS: Just let it
roll down your arm and all

00:37:10.404 --> 00:37:10.988
over the fish.

00:37:10.988 --> 00:37:13.487
So as long as you do it that
way, it usually comes out well.

00:37:13.487 --> 00:37:14.630
BRENDON EDWARDS: Yeah.

00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:15.470
JASON ANDREAS: Any questions?

00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:16.636
You guys have anything else?

00:37:16.636 --> 00:37:20.340
If not, I've got one more
before we wrap things up.

00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:23.080
BRENDON EDWARDS: I tell all
my cooks I like questions.

00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:24.240
JASON ANDREAS: Usually a good
thing in the kitchen, right?

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:24.750
BRENDON EDWARDS: Yeah.

00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:26.166
JASON ANDREAS: Let
me ask you just

00:37:26.166 --> 00:37:31.360
as we wrap things your thoughts
on where Detroit goes next.

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:32.930
Detroit is, kind
of, this cool up

00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:35.775
and coming city
that's experiencing

00:37:35.775 --> 00:37:38.110
this really cool
renaissance in music,

00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:40.230
and art, and all these
different things.

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:41.670
And food is a huge
staple of that.

00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:43.839
You're, obviously,
a part of that.

00:37:43.839 --> 00:37:45.630
It's come a long way
in the past few years.

00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:49.740
What do you see being the
next one or two big things?

00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:51.280
Or what do the
next few years look

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:55.130
like in the city of Detroit
to carve out its niche

00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:57.630
in the national scene?

00:37:57.630 --> 00:38:02.410
BRENDON EDWARDS: I think Detroit
definitely has the ability

00:38:02.410 --> 00:38:05.590
to do things that other
major cities haven't.

00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:10.620
It has the ability to
hold true to its nature.

00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:16.670
And hopefully with the
investments and everything

00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:22.080
that goes into it, that
thought of gentrification

00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:28.710
and whatnot of pushing the city
of what it was out, hopefully,

00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:30.170
it holds together.

00:38:30.170 --> 00:38:32.930
I know my aggravations
with other major cities

00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:38.420
like downtown Chicago,
only the people

00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:40.800
that could afford to be downtown
ended up being downtown.

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:42.258
And then, downtown
wasn't as great.

00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:48.440
I think and I hope
that Detroit has

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:52.620
a possibility of doing
that, of being something

00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:59.940
more community based, more based
on the relationships of all

00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:01.920
the people that
have already created

00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:03.480
what is good in Detroit.

00:39:08.210 --> 00:39:11.420
And I mean, I definitely
see a continuing surge

00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:14.120
in residential
population and everything

00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:16.490
else that's going to
keep driving the city

00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:20.990
to do more things
and be more creative.

00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:25.780
A lot of people that I've
talked to, creatives especially,

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:28.710
are coming to Detroit because
of those opportunities.

00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:36.140
And if the people who are
most relevant in the control

00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:39.782
of Detroit pay
attention to that,

00:39:39.782 --> 00:39:41.240
then I think that's
going to be one

00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:42.948
of the most wonderful
changes that you'll

00:39:42.948 --> 00:39:44.840
see in Detroit in
the next five years

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:47.990
is the creativity, and
the push, and the drive

00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:54.572
to make a city that is, kind
of, unlike most cities around.

00:39:54.572 --> 00:39:56.030
And my only big
hope that I haven't

00:39:56.030 --> 00:40:01.535
seen any real promise of it
is more public transportation.

00:40:01.535 --> 00:40:02.369
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:02.369 --> 00:40:03.910
JASON ANDREAS:
They're working on it.

00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:04.855
The M1, right?

00:40:04.855 --> 00:40:06.710
Is that what it's
called, the M1 rail line?

00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:07.960
BRENDON EDWARDS: It's a start.

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:09.270
AUDIENCE: The Q line.

00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:09.450
JASON ANDREAS: The Q line.

00:40:09.450 --> 00:40:09.980
BRENDON EDWARDS: Q line.

00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:11.396
JASON ANDREAS:
Very well, Brandon.

00:40:11.396 --> 00:40:14.450
You Well thank you very much
for all of your insight.

00:40:14.450 --> 00:40:17.020
I like the idea of community.

00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:20.050
It's huge, obviously, in
the Midwest in Detroit.

00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:21.960
And for a lot of
us, nothing promotes

00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:23.939
community quite like food does.

00:40:23.939 --> 00:40:25.480
So thank you for
the part that you've

00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:28.360
played in all of the
restaurants around Detroit.

00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:29.360
Thank you for coming in.

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:32.390
We'll make sure, based on
all of your advice, that we

00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:34.822
try to strive to be
better guests in all

00:40:34.822 --> 00:40:36.030
of the restaurants we attend.

00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:37.860
I don't think anyone
owns a restaurant here.

00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:38.510
So we can't really
host that well.

00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:40.090
You can host at home, I suppose.

00:40:40.090 --> 00:40:41.405
But be a good host at home.

00:40:41.405 --> 00:40:43.030
And we'll all try
and be the best guest

00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:43.905
that we possibly can.

00:40:43.905 --> 00:40:46.422
So thank you, once again, to
Chef Edwards for coming in.

00:40:46.422 --> 00:40:47.630
Big, quick round of applause.

00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:48.130
Thank you.

00:40:48.130 --> 00:40:50.680
[APPLAUSE]
