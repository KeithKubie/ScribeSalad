00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.260
At first glance, the answer seems obvious.
Think about it- when was the last time you

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.690
saw a grandfather clock in the house of anyone
under the age of 70?

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.820
Grandfather clocks- with their long cases,
pendulums, echoing chimes, and Roman numerals-

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.509
seem to belong to the world of courting parlors,
Model-T Fords, silent movies, and going out

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:33.120
on a date for an ice cream soda. In short,
the world of grandparents.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.700
Yes, this may seem logical and obvious, but
the real reason these timekeeping devices

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.380
(technically called “Longcase clocks”)
picked up the grandfatherly nickname has nothing

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.050
to do with grandparents per se.

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.600
So how did grandfather clocks get this name?
Here’s the scoop…

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.740
In 1875, an American songwriter named Henry
Clay Work was visiting England. While there,

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.829
he checked in to the George Hotel in North
Yorkshire.

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.200
In the hotel’s lobby was a large pendulum
clock. The clock had stopped long ago and

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.690
just sat in the lobby, serving no apparent
purpose. This unmoving clock fascinated Work

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.509
and he asked about its history.

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:14.070
He was told a story by the proprietors, whether
true or not (probably not) isn’t important

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.030
to how grandfather clocks got their name.
The story was that the clock had belonged

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.130
to the inn’s previous two owners, the Jenkins
brothers, both deceased. It seems the clock

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.560
had kept perfect time during their lives,
but when the first Jenkins brother died, the

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.330
clock started becoming less accurate.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.970
After this, the story went that the clock
stopped completely dead- to the minute and

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:40.200
second Jenkins brother had died. Maybe because
it was his job to wind it and nobody else

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.070
wanted the task, you say? 😉 According to
the story Work was told, it was actually because

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.790
it broke. Despite the best efforts of a host
of repairmen supposedly hired by the new owners

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.030
of the inn, they couldn’t get the clock
going again.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.270
Now, of course, what probably actually happened
was the clock died and was prohibitively expensive

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.580
to fix, but looked nice, so the new owners
of the hotel came up with a great story for

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.280
the clock to hide the fact that they maybe
just didn’t want to pay to get it fixed

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.900
nor have it hauled off.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.649
Whatever the case, the bemused Work thought
it was a great story. Being a song writer,

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.650
he then wrote a song about the incident. The
song was called “My Grandfather’s Clock”,

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:15.650
released in 1876.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:16.650
The lyrics were as follows:

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.700
1. My grandfather’s clock was too large
for the shelf, So it stood ninety years on

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.700
the floor;

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.080
It was taller by half than the old man himself,
Though it weighed not a pennyweight more.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.310
It was bought on the morn of the day that
he was born, And was always his treasure and

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.310
pride;

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.319
But it stopp’d short – never to go again
– When the old man died.

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:31.319
CHORUS

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:32.900
Ninety years without slumbering (tick, tick,
tick, tick),

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.190
His life seconds numbering (tick, tick, tick,
tick),

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.060
It stopp’d short – never to go again – When
the old man died.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.810
2. In watching its pendulum swing to and fro,
Many hours had he spent while a boy;

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.690
And in childhood and manhood the clock seemed
to know And to share both his grief and his

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:48.690
joy.

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.440
For it struck twenty-four when he entered
at the door, With a blooming and beautiful

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.440
bride;

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.270
But it stopp’d short – never to go again
– When the old man died.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.270
(CHORUS)

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.200
3. My grandfather said that of those he could
hire, Not a servant so faithful he found;

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.400
For it wasted no time, and had but one desire
– At the close of each week to be wound.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.830
And it kept in its place – not a frown upon
its face, And the hands never hung by its

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:08.830
side;

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.060
But it stopp’d short – never to go again
– When the old man died.

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.060
(CHORUS)

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.459
4. It rang an alarm in the dead of the night
– An alarm that for years had been dumb;

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.090
And we knew that his spirit was pluming for
flight – That his hour of departure had

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.090
come.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.310
Still the clock kept the time, with a soft
and muffled chime, As we silently stood by

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:23.310
his side;

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.340
But it stopp’d short – never to go again
– When the old man died.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.530
The public went crazy over the song. “My
Grandfather’s Clock” went on to sell over

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.290
a million copies in sheet music, which was
fairly unprecedented for the day (Work had

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.550
previously set that precedent selling over
a million copies of the song Marching Through

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.489
Georgia, which is still commonly played by
marching bands today).

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.800
The previous term for “grandfather clock”,
the rather un-catchy “longcase clock”,

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.430
was dropped almost immediately by the public
in favor of the new moniker for the clocks.

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.910
With the advent of digital technology and
atomic clocks, some clock lovers worry that

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.940
the old pendulum-swinging grandfather clocks
may not be long for the current timekeeping

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.010
world. However, despite its inanity, H.C.
Work’s song lives on. It was recorded multiple

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.880
times in the 20th century, and as recently
as 2004 by the R &amp; B act Boys II Men. It’s

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.670
a song that, like grandfather clocks, keeps
on ticking.
