00:00:08.568 --> 00:00:11.971
To someone first encountering
the works of William Shakespeare,

00:00:11.971 --> 00:00:14.540
the language may seem strange.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.625
But there is a secret to appreciating it.

00:00:17.625 --> 00:00:23.383
Although he was famous for his plays,
Shakespeare was first and foremost a poet.

00:00:23.383 --> 00:00:26.202
One of the most important things 
in Shakespeare's language

00:00:26.202 --> 00:00:28.740
is his use of stress.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.153
Not that kind of stress,

00:00:30.153 --> 00:00:34.498
but the way we emphasize certain 
syllables in words more than others.

00:00:34.498 --> 00:00:38.283
We're so used to doing this
that we may not notice it at first.

00:00:38.283 --> 00:00:42.462
But if you say the word slowly,
you can easily identify them.

00:00:42.462 --> 00:00:48.272
Playwright, computer, telephone.

00:00:48.272 --> 00:00:50.644
Poets are very aware of these stresses,

00:00:50.644 --> 00:00:52.609
having long experimented with the number

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:55.603
and order of stressed 
and unstressed syllables,

00:00:55.603 --> 00:01:00.515
and combined them in different ways
to create rhythm in their poems.

00:01:00.515 --> 00:01:01.577
Like songwriters,

00:01:01.577 --> 00:01:06.299
poets often express their ideas through 
a recognizable repetition of these rhythms

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.963
or poetic meter.

00:01:08.963 --> 00:01:09.994
And like music,

00:01:09.994 --> 00:01:14.107
poetry has its own set of terms 
for describing this.

00:01:14.107 --> 00:01:15.619
In a line of verse,

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.249
a foot is a certain number 
of stressed and unstressed syllables

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:21.407
forming a distinct unit,

00:01:21.407 --> 00:01:25.742
just as a musical measure
consists of a certain number of beats.

00:01:25.742 --> 00:01:29.504
One line of verse is usually made
up of several feet.

00:01:29.504 --> 00:01:33.799
For example, a dactyl is a metrical 
foot of three syllables

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:37.976
with the first stressed, and the second
and third unstressed.

00:01:37.976 --> 00:01:41.164
Dactyls can create lines
that move swiftly and gather force,

00:01:41.164 --> 00:01:44.541
as in Robert Browning's poem, 
"The Lost Leader."

00:01:44.541 --> 00:01:51.505
"Just for a handful of silver he left us.
Just for a rib and to stick in his coat."

00:01:51.505 --> 00:01:54.403
Another kind of foot 
is the two-syllable long trochee,

00:01:54.403 --> 00:01:57.619
a stressed syllable 
followed by an unstressed one.

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.272
The trochees in these lines 
from Shakespeare's "Macbeth"

00:02:00.272 --> 00:02:04.224
lend an ominous and spooky tone
to the witches' chant.

00:02:04.224 --> 00:02:10.750
"Double, double, toil and trouble;
fire burn and cauldron bubble."

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.674
But with Shakespeare,
it's all about the iamb.

00:02:13.674 --> 00:02:16.541
This two-syllable foot 
is like a reverse trochee,

00:02:16.541 --> 00:02:20.493
so the first syllable is unstressed
and the second is stressed, as in,

00:02:20.493 --> 00:02:24.215
"To be, or not to be."

00:02:24.215 --> 00:02:28.425
Shakespeare's favorite meter, 
in particular, was iambic pentameter,

00:02:28.425 --> 00:02:31.832
where each line of verse
is made up of five two-syllable iambs,

00:02:31.832 --> 00:02:34.949
for a total of ten syllables.

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:38.357
And it's used for many 
of Shakespeare's most famous lines:

00:02:38.357 --> 00:02:42.597
"Shall I compare thee
to a summer's day?"

00:02:42.597 --> 00:02:46.965
"Arise fair sun, 
and kill the envious moon."

00:02:46.965 --> 00:02:51.406
Notice how the iambs cut across
both punctuation and word separation.

00:02:51.406 --> 00:02:55.548
Meter is all about sound, not spelling.

00:02:55.548 --> 00:02:58.369
Iambic pentameter may sound technical,

00:02:58.369 --> 00:03:01.422
but there's an easy way 
to remember what it means.

00:03:01.422 --> 00:03:05.669
The word iamb is pronounced
just like the phrase, "I am."

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:07.975
Now, let's expand that to a sentence

00:03:07.975 --> 00:03:11.155
that just happens 
to be in iambic pentameter.

00:03:11.155 --> 00:03:15.308
"I am a pirate with a wooden leg."

00:03:15.308 --> 00:03:17.549
The pirate can only walk in iambs,

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.676
a living reminder 
of Shakespeare's favorite meter.

00:03:20.676 --> 00:03:24.428
Iambic pentameter 
is when he takes ten steps.

00:03:24.428 --> 00:03:27.764
Our pirate friend can even help us 
remember how to properly mark it

00:03:27.764 --> 00:03:32.166
if we image the footprints he leaves
walking along a deserted island beach:

00:03:32.166 --> 00:03:37.858
A curve for unstressed syllables,
and a shoe outline for stressed ones.

00:03:37.858 --> 00:03:42.293
"If music be the food of love, play on."

00:03:42.293 --> 00:03:44.572
Of course, most lines 
of Shakespeare's plays

00:03:44.572 --> 00:03:46.820
are written in regular prose.

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.166
But if you read carefully,

00:03:48.166 --> 00:03:51.090
you'll notice that Shakespeare's 
characters turn to poetry,

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.312
and iambic pentameter in particular,

00:03:53.312 --> 00:03:57.778
for many of the same reasons 
that we look to poetry in our own lives.

00:03:57.778 --> 00:04:03.301
Feeling passionate, introspective,
or momentous.

00:04:03.301 --> 00:04:06.808
Whether it's Hamlet pondering 
his existence,

00:04:06.808 --> 00:04:09.100
or Romeo professing his love,

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.848
the characters switch to iambic pentameter
when speaking about their emotions

00:04:12.848 --> 00:04:15.287
and their place in the world.

00:04:15.287 --> 00:04:18.411
Which leaves just one last question.

00:04:18.411 --> 00:04:22.039
Why did Shakespeare choose 
iambic pentameter for these moments,

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:26.669
rather than, say, trochaic hexameter
or dactylic tetrameter?

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:30.138
It's been said that iambic pentameter 
was easy for his actors to memorize

00:04:30.138 --> 00:04:31.795
and for the audience to understand

00:04:31.795 --> 00:04:36.179
because it's naturally suited 
to the English language.

00:04:36.179 --> 00:04:38.131
But there might be another reason.

00:04:38.131 --> 00:04:40.864
The next time you're in a heightened 
emotional situation,

00:04:40.864 --> 00:04:44.045
like the ones that make 
Shakespeare's characters burst into verse,

00:04:44.045 --> 00:04:47.550
put your hand over 
the left side of your chest.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.251
What do you feel?

00:04:49.251 --> 00:04:52.180
That's your heart beating in iambs.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:58.052
Da duhm, da duhm, 
da duhm, da duhm, da duhm.

00:04:58.052 --> 00:05:02.133
Shakespeare's most poetic lines don't just
talk about matters of the heart.

00:05:02.133 --> 00:05:04.288
They follow its rhythm.
