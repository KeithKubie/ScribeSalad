00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.930
It would be most of our first choices to have
relationships in the real world; but for many

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:12.451
of us, it is a great deal more plausible to
pursue them with, and via, our phones. Phones

00:00:12.451 --> 00:00:19.859
provide exemplary compensation for the frustrations
of living with actual people. Unlike them,

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.289
they are always responsive to the touch and
their malleability provides the perfect excuse

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.289
for disengagement from the trickier aspects
of true connections.

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.770
When a friend or partner launches into an
account of their day or an analysis of one

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.360
of our alleged faults, it becomes almost irresistible
not to give these phones a quick check: a

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.080
friend in another country may have just had
a baby or someone we vaguely know might have

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.741
a new opinion on a change in direction in
the nation’s foreign policy. Our phones

00:00:50.741 --> 00:00:57.630
promise us access to people who are so much
less tricky than those in close physical proximity.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:03.579
Humans we have known for years get judged
against angels we have yet to spend a real-life

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.781
minute with. At our most vulnerable moments,
technology companies promise us that they

00:01:08.781 --> 00:01:15.990
will be able to locate that lode star of contemporary
romance: ‘the right person’. The pictures

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.819
they lay out before us are certainly beguiling.
The implicit thesis is that relationships

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:27.590
have gone wrong for us so far not because
they are inherently hard and we are properly

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.759
tricky to live with, but because we haven’t
yet found people with whom we are sufficiently

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:40.689
compatible. There is not much room for the
idea that compatibility may be an achievement

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:47.720
of love and should not therefore – fairly
– be expected to be its precondition. Then,

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.829
to compound the situation, our phones offer
to show us a fascinating range of people without

00:01:53.829 --> 00:02:01.042
clothes. Porn doesn’t judge and it doesn’t
ask for anything back. Closeness to a real

00:02:01.042 --> 00:02:08.119
life partner brings with it so many complications:
unresolved resentments, a daily need to put

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.020
up with a person’s less reasonable sides
and an imperative to face up to our own huge

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.870
failings. But the porn site doesn’t mind
that you slammed the cupboard door and it

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.930
has no desire to take you up on your attitude
to credit card debt. It doesn’t need intimacy

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.810
and it doesn’t complain if you don’t say
much. Its implicit message is: we don’t

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:36.010
care about anything other than your pleasure,
you can be as you are. With bliss and at a

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:43.570
terrible hidden cost, it removes sex entirely
from the emotional landscape. Then there are

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:50.240
the small hearts and ticks. It can feel desperately
naive or narcissistic to admit it – but

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:57.000
in essence, almost all of us deeply like being
‘liked’ – and our phones know this so

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.340
well. We are genuinely moved by a message
letting us know that Matteo from Wisconsin

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:08.980
or Emile from Livorno wants to be our friend.
These little words ‘like’ and ‘friend’

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.680
set off such deep and tender longings in our
souls.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.960
The momentary excitement they unleash reveals
a secret pang of hope that our inner solitude

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:23.360
will be pierced, that our troubles and joys
will be truly understood by another; and that

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:29.140
all the messages we wish to send to the world
will be received and perfectly understood,

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:37.651
at least by someone. It is poignant – and,
in its own quiet way, properly tragic. We

00:03:37.651 --> 00:03:43.650
should not be frightened by our loneliness
or by the difficulties of our real relationships.

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.820
What we should perhaps try to avoid is the
faith that our phones can offer us a genuine

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:55.180
solution to the tensions of love. We should,
when we can manage it (and often we simply

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:01.670
can’t), try to put these technological wonders
to one side and try to do something properly

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:08.390
futuristic for a while: attempt to love the
bewilderingly complex, often maddening and

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.040
sometimes very precious flesh and blood people
presently dwelling in

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.120
the vicinity.
