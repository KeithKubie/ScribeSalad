00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.344
- [Voiceover] Find the value of k

00:00:01.344 --> 00:00:05.347
for which f has a critical
point at x equals negative five.

00:00:05.347 --> 00:00:07.082
All right, so let's just remind ourselves

00:00:07.082 --> 00:00:09.807
what f of x and f prime of x were.

00:00:09.807 --> 00:00:11.646
They gave it to us at the top,

00:00:11.646 --> 00:00:14.979
f of x is equal to one
over x squared minus kx,

00:00:14.979 --> 00:00:17.840
and then f prime of x is
equal to all of this business.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:18.862
Let me rewrite it,

00:00:18.862 --> 00:00:21.230
let me rewrite it down here,

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.787
so f,

00:00:23.787 --> 00:00:27.503
f of x is equal to one over

00:00:27.503 --> 00:00:30.113
x squared minus kx

00:00:30.113 --> 00:00:34.153
and f prime of x is equal to

00:00:34.153 --> 00:00:37.000
k minus two x

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.394
over x squared minus kx,

00:00:41.394 --> 00:00:43.631
whole quantity squared.

00:00:43.631 --> 00:00:45.690
And we wanna find the value of k

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.441
for which f has a critical
point at x equals negative five,

00:00:50.441 --> 00:00:54.535
so f has a critical point
at x equals negative five.

00:00:54.535 --> 00:00:58.426
This means that x,

00:00:58.426 --> 00:01:03.426
that means that x equals
negative five is in domain,

00:01:03.507 --> 00:01:06.646
so this is in domain,

00:01:06.646 --> 00:01:08.345
which means our function itself

00:01:08.345 --> 00:01:12.488
is defined at x equals negative five,

00:01:12.488 --> 00:01:17.488
and it means that f prime of negative five

00:01:17.764 --> 00:01:21.897
is equal to zero or undefined,

00:01:21.897 --> 00:01:23.977
or undefined.

00:01:23.977 --> 00:01:27.368
A critical point is a member
of the functions domain

00:01:27.368 --> 00:01:29.893
where the derivative is equal to zero,

00:01:29.893 --> 00:01:31.947
or it's undefined.

00:01:31.947 --> 00:01:34.841
So let's evaluate f
prime of negative five.

00:01:34.841 --> 00:01:38.373
F prime of negative five in terms of k

00:01:38.373 --> 00:01:42.869
is going to be equal to k
minus two times negative five,

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.255
minus two times negative five,

00:01:45.255 --> 00:01:46.501
all of that over

00:01:46.501 --> 00:01:51.501
negative five squared minus k

00:01:51.698 --> 00:01:54.799
times negative five,

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.646
and then we want to square all of this,

00:01:57.646 --> 00:02:01.346
and so this is going to
be equal to k plus 10,

00:02:01.346 --> 00:02:04.649
k plus 10 over,

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.076
we have 25, what is this?

00:02:08.076 --> 00:02:13.018
25 plus five k,

00:02:13.018 --> 00:02:17.152
plus five k squared.

00:02:17.152 --> 00:02:20.366
So what value of k makes f prime

00:02:20.366 --> 00:02:23.202
of negative five equal to zero?

00:02:23.202 --> 00:02:26.329
Well, f prime of negative five

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:28.388
is equal to zero

00:02:28.388 --> 00:02:32.502
if k is equal to negative ten.

00:02:32.502 --> 00:02:34.610
So that's a value of k for which f has

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.979
a critical point at negative five.

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:38.372
Now, you might be saying,

00:02:38.372 --> 00:02:39.700
well, what values of k?

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:40.866
That's the value of k that makes

00:02:40.866 --> 00:02:42.102
the function equal zero,

00:02:42.102 --> 00:02:43.225
it makes the numerator equal zero,

00:02:43.225 --> 00:02:45.274
and therefore makes the
whole function equal zero.

00:02:45.274 --> 00:02:49.470
But why can't I pick a value
of k that makes the derivative,

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.256
or it makes the numerator
of the derivative zero,

00:02:53.256 --> 00:02:55.211
and so therefore makes
the derivative equal zero,

00:02:55.211 --> 00:02:56.154
I think I said function,

00:02:56.154 --> 00:02:57.891
not the derivative of the function.

00:02:57.891 --> 00:02:58.727
But you might be saying,

00:02:58.727 --> 00:03:00.662
well, why can't I pick a value of k

00:03:00.662 --> 00:03:03.981
that makes the derivative undefined?

00:03:03.981 --> 00:03:05.914
And so, you can think of what that is,

00:03:05.914 --> 00:03:07.271
what would make undefined,

00:03:07.271 --> 00:03:09.900
well, if 25 plus five k is equal to zero,

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.448
well, then this is going to be,

00:03:11.448 --> 00:03:13.170
you're gonna have zero squared,

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.051
and divide it by zero,

00:03:14.051 --> 00:03:15.296
it's going to be undefined,

00:03:15.296 --> 00:03:19.817
so you could say f prime of negative five

00:03:19.817 --> 00:03:21.733
undefined,

00:03:21.733 --> 00:03:26.098
undefined if k is equal to what?

00:03:26.098 --> 00:03:28.413
Negative five, right?

00:03:28.413 --> 00:03:31.207
Five times negative five plus 25 is zero,

00:03:31.207 --> 00:03:32.306
but this,

00:03:32.306 --> 00:03:34.825
if k is equal to negative five,

00:03:34.825 --> 00:03:37.593
then this can't be a
critical point anymore,

00:03:37.593 --> 00:03:39.641
x equals negative five
can't be a critical point

00:03:39.641 --> 00:03:42.070
because it won't be in
it's domain anymore.

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:43.779
If k is equal to negative five,

00:03:43.779 --> 00:03:45.980
then f of x would be equal to one

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.120
over x squared plus five x,

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.215
plus five x,

00:03:51.215 --> 00:03:54.368
and then f will not be
defined at negative five,

00:03:54.368 --> 00:03:56.123
and so the negative five
couldn't be a critical point

00:03:56.123 --> 00:03:58.808
because it's not even in the domain.

00:03:58.808 --> 00:04:00.238
So the important thing is,

00:04:00.238 --> 00:04:01.585
in order to be a critical point,

00:04:01.585 --> 00:04:02.987
it has to be in the domain,

00:04:02.987 --> 00:04:05.086
and the derivative at that point

00:04:05.086 --> 00:04:07.130
has to be equal to zero undefined.

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.712
I can get the derivative to
be undefined at negative five,

00:04:09.712 --> 00:04:11.505
if we said k equals negative five,

00:04:11.505 --> 00:04:13.402
but with we said k equals negative five,

00:04:13.402 --> 00:04:16.928
then x equals negative five
will no longer be in the domain,

00:04:16.928 --> 00:04:20.068
so we wanna go with the k
that just makes the numerator

00:04:20.068 --> 00:04:21.582
of our derivative equal to zero,

00:04:21.582 --> 00:04:24.628
or sets our entire
derivative equal to zero.
