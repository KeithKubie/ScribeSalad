at Google and I wanted to talk to you a

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280
at Google and I wanted to talk to you a
 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.099
at Google and I wanted to talk to you a
little bit about how I use Kotlin to

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109
little bit about how I use Kotlin to
 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.990

faces are kind of hard right now and you

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939
faces are kind of hard right now and you
 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.939
faces are kind of hard right now and you

you actually have to manually paint
 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.130
you actually have to manually paint
everything and then you have to include

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140
everything and then you have to include
 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.750
everything and then you have to include
a bunch of code just to make sure when

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760
a bunch of code just to make sure when
 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.830

hurting the battery life so I was trying

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110
hurting the battery life so I was trying
 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.580
hurting the battery life so I was trying
to think of ways to improve this and

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590
to think of ways to improve this and
 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.080
to think of ways to improve this and
last year at i/o we announced official

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090
last year at i/o we announced official
 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.819
last year at i/o we announced official
support for Kotlin so I started thinking

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829
support for Kotlin so I started thinking
 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.200
support for Kotlin so I started thinking
how could I use Kotlin to make this

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210
how could I use Kotlin to make this
 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.720
how could I use Kotlin to make this
easier and I did convert the whole thing

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730
easier and I did convert the whole thing
 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.880
easier and I did convert the whole thing
to Kotlin which did reduce the code

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890
to Kotlin which did reduce the code
 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.060
to Kotlin which did reduce the code
lines a lot but I found something else

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070
lines a lot but I found something else
 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.220
lines a lot but I found something else
with Colin that made it even more cool

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230
with Colin that made it even more cool
 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.160
with Colin that made it even more cool
and that was something called DSL so

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170
and that was something called DSL so
 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.350
and that was something called DSL so
what does Kotlin DSL

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360
what does Kotlin DSL
 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.969
what does Kotlin DSL
the best way to understand what

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979
the best way to understand what
 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.640
the best way to understand what
domain-specific language is is to

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650
domain-specific language is is to
 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.190
domain-specific language is is to
compare it to a regular programming

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200
compare it to a regular programming
 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.859
compare it to a regular programming
language so again domain-specific

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869
language so again domain-specific
 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.810
language so again domain-specific
language that for me didn't really help

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820
language that for me didn't really help
 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.090
language that for me didn't really help
me what it meant but if you compare it

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100
me what it meant but if you compare it
 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.590
me what it meant but if you compare it
to like a general programming language

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600
to like a general programming language
 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.149
to like a general programming language
like Kotlin or java where you have a

bunch of keywords you have classes
 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.370

methods and you make a nice big app the

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380
methods and you make a nice big app the
 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.770

ops on the other side is a DSL which

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780
ops on the other side is a DSL which
 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.260
ops on the other side is a DSL which
focuses on a specific task or domain so

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270
focuses on a specific task or domain so
 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.929
focuses on a specific task or domain so
it four goes a lot of functionality and

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939
it four goes a lot of functionality and
 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.910
it four goes a lot of functionality and
lets you just do that specific task

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920
lets you just do that specific task
 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.920
lets you just do that specific task
you've actually probably used external

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930
you've actually probably used external
 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.350
you've actually probably used external
DSL and not even realized it for example

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360
DSL and not even realized it for example

sequel for manipulating databases
 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.719
sequel for manipulating databases
that's a DSL so regular expressions for

that's a DSL so regular expressions for
 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.240
that's a DSL so regular expressions for
manipulating strings so they have each

disadvantage here is you probably know

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190
disadvantage here is you probably know
 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.480
disadvantage here is you probably know
is you have to put that as

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490
is you have to put that as
 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.970
is you have to put that as
literal so you have to pray and hope

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980
literal so you have to pray and hope
 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.950
literal so you have to pray and hope
that you spelled everything right until

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960
that you spelled everything right until
 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.750
that you spelled everything right until
run time and then maybe it fails and you

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760
run time and then maybe it fails and you
 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.460
run time and then maybe it fails and you
have to pack through it and figure out

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470
have to pack through it and figure out
 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.800
have to pack through it and figure out
what's going on so with Colin DSL it

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810
what's going on so with Colin DSL it
 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.570
what's going on so with Colin DSL it
actually extracts that out of the string

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580
actually extracts that out of the string
 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.100
actually extracts that out of the string
and it puts it right in your codes you

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110
and it puts it right in your codes you
 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.950
and it puts it right in your codes you
can have type checking you can have code

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960
can have type checking you can have code
 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.630
can have type checking you can have code
hints and all that good stuff that comes

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640
hints and all that good stuff that comes
 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.410
hints and all that good stuff that comes
with your IDE so now that you kind of in

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420
with your IDE so now that you kind of in
 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.000
with your IDE so now that you kind of in
have an idea of what it is I like to

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010
have an idea of what it is I like to
 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.460
have an idea of what it is I like to
show you two structures really quick and

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470
show you two structures really quick and
 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.530
show you two structures really quick and
I use the ladder but there's one called

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540
I use the ladder but there's one called
 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.840
I use the ladder but there's one called
creating one through chain method calls

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850
creating one through chain method calls
 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.940
creating one through chain method calls
and the other one is nesting of lambdas

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950
and the other one is nesting of lambdas
 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.850
and the other one is nesting of lambdas
so recognizing DSL is really subjective

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860
so recognizing DSL is really subjective
 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.980
so recognizing DSL is really subjective
so you know when you see it so let's see

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990
so you know when you see it so let's see
 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.750
so you know when you see it so let's see
some so this is Kotlin DSL for sequel

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760
some so this is Kotlin DSL for sequel
 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.910
some so this is Kotlin DSL for sequel
you could probably look at it and if you

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920
you could probably look at it and if you
 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.680
you could probably look at it and if you
know it's sequel you can understand it

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690
know it's sequel you can understand it
 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:59.070
know it's sequel you can understand it
right away

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080
right away
 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.530
right away
and it's all verbs like slice and then I

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540
and it's all verbs like slice and then I
 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.090
and it's all verbs like slice and then I
select all and then I group by they're

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100
select all and then I group by they're
 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.100
select all and then I group by they're
not order by and then I limit and this

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110
not order by and then I limit and this
 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.500
not order by and then I limit and this
is all type checked and you get code

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510
is all type checked and you get code
 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:08.610
is all type checked and you get code
hinting so you don't spell anything

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620
hinting so you don't spell anything
 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.980
hinting so you don't spell anything
wrong and this is pretty great and it's

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:10.990
wrong and this is pretty great and it's
 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.050
wrong and this is pretty great and it's
understandable this is Gaea so but the

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060
understandable this is Gaea so but the
 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.880
understandable this is Gaea so but the
DSL for the watch face which I really

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890
DSL for the watch face which I really
 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.910
DSL for the watch face which I really
liked was the nested lambda structure so

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920
liked was the nested lambda structure so
 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.280
liked was the nested lambda structure so
this is to create a watch face you can

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290
this is to create a watch face you can
 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.720
this is to create a watch face you can
see right away create a watch face as a

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730
see right away create a watch face as a
 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.390
see right away create a watch face as a
verb but if you look at my structure you

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400
verb but if you look at my structure you
 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.280
