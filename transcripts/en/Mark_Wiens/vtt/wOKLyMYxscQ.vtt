00:00:00.905 --> 00:00:02.470
- I'm gonna take a piece of chapati

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:05.053
and scoop up for my first bite.

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:19.209
Wow, that is amazing.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.797
(rhythmic drum music)

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.029
Good morning everyone, it's Mark Wiens

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.974
with migrationology.com in Mumbai, India.

00:00:29.974 --> 00:00:35.394
It is almost 9 a.m., this
is our first day in Mumbai,

00:00:35.669 --> 00:00:38.692
and I have a list of a bunch of things,

00:00:38.692 --> 00:00:41.348
a bunch of places to eat
and some attractions,

00:00:41.348 --> 00:00:44.014
some sightseeing to do, but really,

00:00:44.014 --> 00:00:45.564
I find it really kind of hard

00:00:45.564 --> 00:00:47.808
to make a set itinerary when

00:00:47.808 --> 00:00:49.838
you don't really know
how to navigate around.

00:00:49.838 --> 00:00:52.800
So we are just off to just walk around

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.344
for a little while and
see what happens today.

00:00:56.344 --> 00:00:59.511
(mellow Indian music)

00:01:02.581 --> 00:01:05.655
Our hotel is in the Colaba area,

00:01:05.655 --> 00:01:07.536
but we're taking a little
walk down the road,

00:01:07.536 --> 00:01:09.222
or past a couple roundabouts

00:01:09.222 --> 00:01:10.760
to an area called Fort.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:11.975
One of the things I love about India

00:01:11.975 --> 00:01:14.767
and that I remember from
my previous trips to India

00:01:14.767 --> 00:01:16.600
is that even in the huge cities,

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.625
the congested huge cities,

00:01:18.625 --> 00:01:23.401
you can still always hear the
birds chirping in the trees.

00:01:23.401 --> 00:01:25.234
That's pretty awesome.

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:28.899
(dog barking)

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.677
(street noises)

00:01:38.451 --> 00:01:41.463
And all of a sudden, it looks
like it's going to downpour.

00:01:41.463 --> 00:01:43.062
Even the birds are flying away.

00:01:43.062 --> 00:01:44.675
Oh, okay, it's starting to rain

00:01:44.675 --> 00:01:46.306
right now as I'm talking.

00:01:46.306 --> 00:01:47.777
We didn't get that far,

00:01:47.777 --> 00:01:49.405
we didn't get anything accomplished,

00:01:49.405 --> 00:01:51.000
but it has started raining.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.347
So far, walking around
this area is really nice.

00:01:53.347 --> 00:01:56.235
What I really like are all of the trees,

00:01:56.235 --> 00:01:58.386
so many trees, and then just like

00:01:58.386 --> 00:02:00.652
kind of decaying old buildings,

00:02:00.652 --> 00:02:03.361
but it's beautiful to
walk around this area.

00:02:03.361 --> 00:02:06.112
Luckily, the rain didn't last very long,

00:02:06.112 --> 00:02:08.729
and so we are walking now over to

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.630
one of the main train stations,

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.213
which is known in brief as CST.

00:02:14.179 --> 00:02:16.846
(horns honking)

00:02:24.478 --> 00:02:27.883
The real name is
Chhatrapati Sivaji Terminus,

00:02:27.883 --> 00:02:30.547
which I am reading from up here,

00:02:30.547 --> 00:02:33.905
but the old name is VT,
which is Victoria Terminal,

00:02:33.905 --> 00:02:37.174
and there are just masses of people.

00:02:37.174 --> 00:02:40.058
It is like a humidity steam bath

00:02:40.058 --> 00:02:43.538
in Mumbai right now after that rain.

00:02:43.538 --> 00:02:46.705
(mellow Indian music)

00:02:51.014 --> 00:02:54.014
(speaking in Hindi)

00:03:30.777 --> 00:03:33.460
Okay, thank you very much.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.957
One of the absolute best joys

00:03:35.957 --> 00:03:38.853
of being in India is drinking chai,

00:03:38.853 --> 00:03:40.643
and you, just walking down the streets,

00:03:40.643 --> 00:03:43.867
there are tea stalls everywhere you look.

00:03:43.867 --> 00:03:46.775
They brew it fresh, and
they add milk in it,

00:03:46.775 --> 00:03:49.749
and then they squeeze out the tea leaves,

00:03:49.749 --> 00:03:52.463
and then they serve it to
you just in small cups,

00:03:52.463 --> 00:03:54.652
and it's always piping hot,

00:03:54.652 --> 00:03:55.971
actually like burning hot,

00:03:55.971 --> 00:03:58.721
my fingers are on fire right now.

00:04:00.823 --> 00:04:02.906
Oh, oh I have missed you,

00:04:04.507 --> 00:04:06.174
oh that's wonderful.

00:04:07.146 --> 00:04:09.427
It's strong tea, you can taste

00:04:09.427 --> 00:04:11.273
just a hint of spice in there,

00:04:11.273 --> 00:04:13.621
and maybe a little bit
of cardamom in there,

00:04:13.621 --> 00:04:16.915
and then it's creamy, just fantastic.

00:04:16.915 --> 00:04:18.521
There's just nothing greater than

00:04:18.521 --> 00:04:21.365
standing along the side of the street

00:04:21.365 --> 00:04:23.282
drinking a cup of chai.

00:04:25.854 --> 00:04:27.390
Yeah.

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.057
(horns honking)

00:04:32.457 --> 00:04:34.655
Drinking cups of hot tea
on the side of the road

00:04:34.655 --> 00:04:39.058
is just one of the great
joys of being in India.

00:04:39.058 --> 00:04:43.495
It's so good, it's such a
simple, fantastic thing.

00:04:43.495 --> 00:04:45.325
We are now walking to try and find

00:04:45.325 --> 00:04:48.180
a very legendary restaurant in Mumbai.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.299
- [Ing] I think it's right there.

00:04:50.299 --> 00:04:51.231
How are you?

00:04:51.231 --> 00:04:52.721
- I am fine.

00:04:52.721 --> 00:04:53.769
Where from?

00:04:53.769 --> 00:04:55.602
- [Ing] From Thailand.

00:04:56.587 --> 00:04:58.676
- This is my friend, my friend.

00:04:58.676 --> 00:05:00.198
- [Mark] Okay, good, good.

00:05:00.198 --> 00:05:01.292
- Why you came here?

00:05:01.292 --> 00:05:03.204
- [Mark] Just traveling, and eating.

00:05:03.204 --> 00:05:04.878
Came to eat.

00:05:04.878 --> 00:05:06.514
- Indian food, okay.

00:05:06.514 --> 00:05:07.536
- [Mark] Is it open yet?

00:05:07.536 --> 00:05:08.737
- Yeah, it's not open.

00:05:08.737 --> 00:05:10.797
- [Mark] Nice to meet you.

00:05:10.797 --> 00:05:14.741
When I asked for restaurant
recommendations in Mumbai,

00:05:14.741 --> 00:05:16.617
Brittania and Company,

00:05:16.617 --> 00:05:18.497
this was one of the top recommendations,

00:05:18.497 --> 00:05:19.630
so I am here.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.877
This restaurant is famous
for serving Parsi food,

00:05:22.877 --> 00:05:26.721
which is a combination
of Iranian Persian food

00:05:26.721 --> 00:05:29.823
and Indian food, and so
this is a type of cuisine

00:05:29.823 --> 00:05:32.098
that you have to eat
when you are in Mumbai.

00:05:32.098 --> 00:05:34.438
Also, we got here kind
of right as they opened,

00:05:34.438 --> 00:05:36.048
so we beat the lunch rush,

00:05:36.048 --> 00:05:38.632
but I'm sure in maybe an hour from how,

00:05:38.632 --> 00:05:40.043
when the offices are let out,

00:05:40.043 --> 00:05:41.668
this place is going to be packed.

00:05:41.668 --> 00:05:43.801
And our first dish has just arrived.

00:05:43.801 --> 00:05:45.633
I've also got a fresh chapati,

00:05:45.633 --> 00:05:47.953
oh, you can feel how fresh and kind of,

00:05:47.953 --> 00:05:50.587
it's kind of dense but
fluffy at the same time,

00:05:50.587 --> 00:05:53.170
and scoop up for my first bite.

00:06:04.723 --> 00:06:06.473
Wow, that is amazing.

00:06:08.027 --> 00:06:11.027
That mutton is kind of like stringy,

00:06:12.554 --> 00:06:14.876
and then the flavor
that's wrapped up in it,

00:06:14.876 --> 00:06:17.881
but the blend of spices in there,

00:06:17.881 --> 00:06:20.597
I'm not even totally sure
what is all in there,

00:06:20.597 --> 00:06:22.301
but wow, it's flavorful,

00:06:22.301 --> 00:06:24.920
and it's really not, it's kind of watery,

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.700
as opposed to buttery or
oily, which is really nice,

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.692
and then all these little
fried crispies on there,

00:06:31.692 --> 00:06:33.840
they kind of add an
extra texture dimension.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.885
It's not so strong, like an Indian curry,

00:06:35.885 --> 00:06:38.538
but it has a little bit
of a milder taste to it,

00:06:38.538 --> 00:06:39.841
but incredibly good.

00:06:39.841 --> 00:06:41.446
I'm going to add some
of these onions though,

00:06:41.446 --> 00:06:43.129
these onions are very tempting,

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:45.852
oh, and a wedge of lime.

00:06:45.852 --> 00:06:50.164
This might give it the added
boost of fresh crunch to it,

00:06:50.164 --> 00:06:51.686
not that it needs anything extra,

00:06:51.686 --> 00:06:54.421
but I'm just kind of an onion kind of guy.

00:06:54.421 --> 00:06:56.838
Okay, that's a lot of onions.

00:07:02.394 --> 00:07:03.227
Wow.

00:07:06.215 --> 00:07:10.048
It's such an amazing
blend of spices and meat.

00:07:11.517 --> 00:07:13.635
I also don't want to
pass up this opportunity

00:07:13.635 --> 00:07:15.539
to mention how good the chapati is.

00:07:15.539 --> 00:07:19.204
The chapati is kind of gooey, but then,

00:07:19.204 --> 00:07:22.614
it's light and it actually is really,

00:07:22.614 --> 00:07:24.543
it's an amazing chapati.

00:07:24.543 --> 00:07:26.777
Thank you very much.

00:07:26.777 --> 00:07:28.287
- [Waiter] It's special.

00:07:28.287 --> 00:07:30.665
- I didn't even notice this at first

00:07:30.665 --> 00:07:32.602
when I sat down at the restaurant,

00:07:32.602 --> 00:07:34.893
but something I have to point out to you

00:07:34.893 --> 00:07:37.143
is this bouquet of napkins.

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:40.689
What a beautiful stack,

00:07:40.689 --> 00:07:42.068
I'm gonna grab one off the top here,

00:07:42.068 --> 00:07:44.485
and then also on the napkins.

00:07:47.535 --> 00:07:50.255
That is my kind of a phrase.

00:07:50.255 --> 00:07:52.464
The other dishes that
we ordered have arrived,

00:07:52.464 --> 00:07:55.294
and one of the dishes that this restaurant

00:07:55.294 --> 00:07:57.442
is very well known for
is their berry pulav,

00:07:57.442 --> 00:08:00.982
and pulav is, it's similar to biryani,

00:08:00.982 --> 00:08:03.192
not quite the same,
actually quite different,

00:08:03.192 --> 00:08:05.187
but they're famous for
serving a berry version,

00:08:05.187 --> 00:08:08.330
and I think, I think
the berries are like ...

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:10.551
- Bar berries, they are dried,

00:08:10.551 --> 00:08:12.250
and this is rice.

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:13.160
- Oh, okay.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.367
Bar berry, okay, they
are called bar berries,

00:08:16.367 --> 00:08:17.479
and they are, yeah,

00:08:17.479 --> 00:08:20.340
they look kind of like very small raisins,

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:22.674
very dried up, or little black currants,

00:08:22.674 --> 00:08:24.240
and then also on the top,

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.861
there were a bunch of fried shallots,

00:08:26.861 --> 00:08:28.491
and then we got the one with chicken,

00:08:28.491 --> 00:08:30.488
that's a big nugget of chicken.

00:08:30.488 --> 00:08:32.132
Let me just taste, making sure I got

00:08:32.132 --> 00:08:34.799
a lot of those berries in there.

00:08:39.279 --> 00:08:40.112
Mm-hmm.

00:08:43.953 --> 00:08:47.015
It's so fragrant, and
those little berries,

00:08:47.015 --> 00:08:50.265
they kind of have a sour taste to them.

00:08:53.149 --> 00:08:56.649
Mm, it's not really very strong in flavor,

00:08:57.683 --> 00:09:01.136
but everything really
just harmonizes together.

00:09:01.136 --> 00:09:02.474
And then the final dish we got

00:09:02.474 --> 00:09:04.348
is something called dhansak,

00:09:04.348 --> 00:09:06.947
which is the Parsi version of lentils,

00:09:06.947 --> 00:09:08.511
and we got the mutton version,

00:09:08.511 --> 00:09:10.550
so there's chunks of mutton in it as well,

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:13.211
and then it's served with
his big plate of rice,

00:09:13.211 --> 00:09:15.958
which is some kind of
spiced or fragrant rice,

00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:18.277
as well as a couple of,

00:09:18.277 --> 00:09:20.582
i think these are mutton meatballs.

00:09:20.582 --> 00:09:24.165
I'll put some of the
rice down as the base,

00:09:28.129 --> 00:09:29.897
and then go for some of the dhansak,

00:09:29.897 --> 00:09:33.147
oh, and those are big chunks of mutton.

00:09:36.675 --> 00:09:40.842
I just want to taste that
dhansak, actually, first.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:43.873
Mm, mm.

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:55.434
There's some kind of very
unique spice in there,

00:09:55.434 --> 00:09:57.184
like maybe fenugreek,

00:09:58.319 --> 00:10:01.742
but it has a very unique,
distinct spice to it.

00:10:01.742 --> 00:10:05.061
- Spices inside is the
green chile, red chile also.

00:10:05.061 --> 00:10:06.728
- I was thinking there was
some kind of spice in it,

00:10:06.728 --> 00:10:09.013
but I just asked the
waiter, and he told me that

00:10:09.013 --> 00:10:12.476
it's both green chile
and red chile in there

00:10:12.476 --> 00:10:13.605
that gives it the flavor,

00:10:13.605 --> 00:10:15.749
and then it's just the lentils,

00:10:15.749 --> 00:10:17.863
so it has kind of that lentil,

00:10:17.863 --> 00:10:22.758
grainy texture to it, a
piece of that mutton, oh yes.

00:10:22.758 --> 00:10:23.925
Tender mutton.

00:10:31.362 --> 00:10:33.426
That was some really good food,

00:10:33.426 --> 00:10:35.490
and one of the things that also

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:37.623
is highly recommended here that I think

00:10:37.623 --> 00:10:40.108
just about everybody who
eats here orders for dessert

00:10:40.108 --> 00:10:42.403
is the caramel custard,

00:10:42.403 --> 00:10:44.292
and I don't really have a sweet tooth,

00:10:44.292 --> 00:10:46.042
but I have to try it.

00:10:49.093 --> 00:10:49.926
Mm.

00:10:52.546 --> 00:10:54.547
Wow, it's almost like cream cheesy,

00:10:54.547 --> 00:10:57.457
just lightly caramel flavored,

00:10:57.457 --> 00:11:00.150
and then sweet, not
like silky soft smooth,

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:01.567
but kind of like,

00:11:03.254 --> 00:11:04.254
airy smooth.

00:11:05.758 --> 00:11:07.991
Yeah, that is very good.

00:11:07.991 --> 00:11:11.193
It's kind of like a stiff pudding.

00:11:11.193 --> 00:11:12.360
- I know them.

00:11:14.127 --> 00:11:15.978
- [Mark] Oh, very nice.

00:11:15.978 --> 00:11:19.027
- They have drink in
Mumbai, two months ago,

00:11:19.027 --> 00:11:22.134
and they invited me to dine with them.

00:11:22.134 --> 00:11:24.682
I went and met them at hotel.

00:11:24.682 --> 00:11:25.849
- [Mark] Okay.

00:12:04.416 --> 00:12:05.333
- Oh, okay.

00:12:13.294 --> 00:12:14.892
- Parsi.

00:12:14.892 --> 00:12:17.975
The Parsi food is a combination of --

00:12:23.404 --> 00:12:24.916
- Did you have the berry pulav?

00:12:24.916 --> 00:12:28.002
- Yes, we had the
chicken berry, very nice.

00:12:28.002 --> 00:12:30.711
- Part Indian and Iran culture.

00:12:30.711 --> 00:12:34.416
- Just finished our meal
at Brittania and Company,

00:12:34.416 --> 00:12:36.753
the food was incredible.

00:12:36.753 --> 00:12:39.429
I especially liked the berry pulav,

00:12:39.429 --> 00:12:41.478
the rice dish with those berries on top,

00:12:41.478 --> 00:12:45.913
and also that sali boti
was just unbelievably good.

00:12:45.913 --> 00:12:48.613
What really makes this restaurant

00:12:48.613 --> 00:12:51.948
like a heritage, and
just a beautiful place,

00:12:51.948 --> 00:12:53.772
is because of the owners

00:12:53.772 --> 00:12:56.309
and the history of the restaurant.

00:12:56.309 --> 00:12:58.902
The owner, he is 94 years old

00:12:58.902 --> 00:13:00.864
at the time of making this video,

00:13:00.864 --> 00:13:05.364
and he is up and around,
talking and greeting all of,

00:13:05.364 --> 00:13:07.979
everyone eating at the
restaurant, telling stories.

00:13:07.979 --> 00:13:09.487
He'll definitely tell you some stories,

00:13:09.487 --> 00:13:11.961
but he's an extremely nice man,

00:13:11.961 --> 00:13:14.544
and he's really an inspiration.

00:13:17.043 --> 00:13:18.460
Hello, by Colaba.

00:13:25.979 --> 00:13:28.981
Lunch was extremely good, I am stuffed,

00:13:28.981 --> 00:13:30.861
so we decided to jump into a taxi

00:13:30.861 --> 00:13:35.076
and we're on our way to
go visit a museum next.

00:13:35.076 --> 00:13:38.243
(mellow Indian music)

00:13:52.141 --> 00:13:54.756
We drove all the way to a museum called

00:13:54.756 --> 00:13:57.836
Dr. Bhau Daji museum, but unfortunately,

00:13:57.836 --> 00:14:01.011
today they are closed, even though

00:14:01.011 --> 00:14:03.435
the opening hours said
they were open today,

00:14:03.435 --> 00:14:05.770
but they said today it's randomly closed,

00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:06.889
so instead we're going to drive over

00:14:06.889 --> 00:14:09.430
to the Gandhi museum.

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:12.299
Something that will
never get old or boring

00:14:12.299 --> 00:14:16.730
is looking out the window
while driving around in India.

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:20.897
There's just so much action
happening everywhere you look.

00:14:25.055 --> 00:14:27.752
It just started downpouring again.

00:14:27.752 --> 00:14:29.577
It will like downpour for a few minutes,

00:14:29.577 --> 00:14:32.678
and then just kind of drizzle for awhile,

00:14:32.678 --> 00:14:34.335
and then it will downpour,
and then it will stop,

00:14:34.335 --> 00:14:37.002
and then it will downpour again.

00:14:39.229 --> 00:14:40.479
Lots of people.

00:14:43.021 --> 00:14:45.604
This is the biggest laundromat.

00:14:49.772 --> 00:14:52.097
As we were driving on
our way to the museum,

00:14:52.097 --> 00:14:54.962
our taxi driver, who is very kind,

00:14:54.962 --> 00:14:56.739
stopped here at Dhobi Ghat,

00:14:56.739 --> 00:15:00.005
and Dhobi Ghat is Mumbai's largest

00:15:00.005 --> 00:15:01.672
open air laundromat.

00:15:03.495 --> 00:15:04.925
We're going to go down the stairs

00:15:04.925 --> 00:15:06.305
to the bottom of the laundromat

00:15:06.305 --> 00:15:08.040
and just take a quick look.

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:10.006
You've kind of got to
walk around the outside,

00:15:10.006 --> 00:15:13.173
but I think this is the main entrance.

00:15:14.933 --> 00:15:15.766
Hello.

00:15:15.766 --> 00:15:16.933
- [Boy] Hello.

00:15:19.127 --> 00:15:22.373
(speaking in Hindi)

00:15:22.373 --> 00:15:23.802
- It's not too busy right now,

00:15:23.802 --> 00:15:25.971
maybe it's the time of
the day that we're here,

00:15:25.971 --> 00:15:27.768
right in the middle of the afternoon,

00:15:27.768 --> 00:15:29.532
but this is like an entire,

00:15:29.532 --> 00:15:32.248
an entire community, and entire village

00:15:32.248 --> 00:15:36.415
that washes clothes, and
there are just pools of water.

00:15:45.233 --> 00:15:46.655
We can only stay here for a few minutes

00:15:46.655 --> 00:15:49.856
because our taxi driver is
waiting on the bridge for us,

00:15:49.856 --> 00:15:52.222
but it's really
interesting to walk around.

00:15:52.222 --> 00:15:55.918
This is just an entire, whoa, be careful,

00:15:55.918 --> 00:15:57.365
you've got to be careful
where you're walking,

00:15:57.365 --> 00:16:00.874
or you will end up in the laundromat,

00:16:00.874 --> 00:16:02.893
but it's very interesting to see,

00:16:02.893 --> 00:16:07.222
and this is Mumbai's
largest open air laundromat,

00:16:07.222 --> 00:16:09.753
maybe one of the largest
open air laundromats

00:16:09.753 --> 00:16:11.420
in the entire world.

00:16:12.664 --> 00:16:13.497
Hello.

00:16:13.497 --> 00:16:14.330
- [Man] Hello.

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:15.830
- How are you?

00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:16.747
Be careful.

00:16:28.376 --> 00:16:31.209
Because it's the rainy
season in Mumbai right now,

00:16:31.209 --> 00:16:34.134
and it's been raining off and on all day,

00:16:34.134 --> 00:16:37.511
when it stops raining, the air is just so

00:16:37.511 --> 00:16:40.887
incredibly humid, it's
just saturated with water,

00:16:40.887 --> 00:16:42.938
you can probably see my face right now,

00:16:42.938 --> 00:16:45.228
I don't know, can you see
beads of perspiration,

00:16:45.228 --> 00:16:47.362
but just walking around
Dhobi Ghat for a few seconds,

00:16:47.362 --> 00:16:50.163
and I'm just literally dripping.

00:16:50.163 --> 00:16:52.237
My shirt is just, you could probably

00:16:52.237 --> 00:16:55.794
wring this out like the laundromat.

00:16:55.794 --> 00:16:59.211
(light Indian pop music)

00:17:08.714 --> 00:17:10.547
- Gandhi house museum.

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:14.513
- We drove over now to the
Mani Bhavan Gandhi Museum,

00:17:14.513 --> 00:17:17.024
and it's amazing the contrast in Mumbai

00:17:17.024 --> 00:17:20.390
from the main roads that
are just out of control,

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:22.301
to the side streets and neighborhoods,

00:17:22.301 --> 00:17:25.000
where it's so quiet and just tree lined,

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.122
and it's really beautiful
on these side streets.

00:17:28.122 --> 00:17:29.734
Our taxi driver was really nice,

00:17:29.734 --> 00:17:32.327
his name was Pradeep, thank you, Pradeep,

00:17:32.327 --> 00:17:35.133
and we are now stopping
here at the museum.

00:17:35.133 --> 00:17:37.470
This is the house where Gandhi lived

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:40.450
when he would make his visits to Mumbai,

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:44.117
from I think it was
from about 1917 to 1934.

00:17:45.275 --> 00:17:47.367
There's a library in there, and mostly

00:17:47.367 --> 00:17:49.319
the museum just walks you through a lot of

00:17:49.319 --> 00:17:52.319
photographs of Gandhi and his impact

00:17:53.358 --> 00:17:55.934
on both India and the world,

00:17:55.934 --> 00:18:00.600
and just his incredible work
and the things that he did.

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:03.486
It's really a quiet
peaceful place in there.

00:18:03.486 --> 00:18:06.173
You can just kind of
stroll around leisurely.

00:18:06.173 --> 00:18:08.535
Our next plan of action is to walk over to

00:18:08.535 --> 00:18:11.347
Chowpatty Beach, which is, should just be

00:18:11.347 --> 00:18:14.330
a few minutes walk away
from where we are right now,

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:17.182
and hopefully, yeah, we'll
walk close to the beach,

00:18:17.182 --> 00:18:18.995
enjoy the views, and hopefully there'll be

00:18:18.995 --> 00:18:22.733
some snacks around that
area as well, to enjoy.

00:18:22.733 --> 00:18:24.900
I'm ready for some snacks.

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:31.653
We made it to Chowpatty,
which is one of the

00:18:31.653 --> 00:18:33.859
main beaches in Mumbai.

00:18:33.859 --> 00:18:36.192
It's a huge expanse of sand,

00:18:37.411 --> 00:18:40.588
and there are crows or
pigeons flying over.

00:18:40.588 --> 00:18:43.355
You get a nice view of the city,

00:18:43.355 --> 00:18:45.130
and I think we're just going to walk along

00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:47.589
this stretch of beach for a little while.

00:18:47.589 --> 00:18:48.422
Okay.

00:18:50.227 --> 00:18:53.755
(speaking in Hindi)

00:18:53.755 --> 00:18:55.015
Very nice dresses.

00:18:55.015 --> 00:18:55.848
- Thanks.

00:18:57.985 --> 00:19:01.568
- So many people in
Mumbai are so friendly.

00:19:06.276 --> 00:19:09.276
(speaking in Hindi)

00:19:17.694 --> 00:19:20.000
This is not really a
swimming beach, hello.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.413
- Hello, hi.

00:19:21.413 --> 00:19:23.039
- [Mark] How are you?

00:19:23.039 --> 00:19:23.872
- Fine.

00:19:23.872 --> 00:19:25.455
- Nice to meet you.

00:19:27.079 --> 00:19:28.818
This isn't really a swimming beach,

00:19:28.818 --> 00:19:30.604
although there are some kids swimming,

00:19:30.604 --> 00:19:32.585
but it's more of a strolling beach.

00:19:32.585 --> 00:19:36.752
It has a huge sandbank, so
you can just walk along.

00:19:38.797 --> 00:19:42.067
(speaking in Hindi)

00:19:42.067 --> 00:19:44.434
Okay, nice to meet you, bye.

00:19:44.434 --> 00:19:46.463
Ing and I have had a selfie marathon

00:19:46.463 --> 00:19:48.317
here at Chowpatty Beach.

00:19:48.317 --> 00:19:50.147
One of my favorite things to eat,

00:19:50.147 --> 00:19:52.072
street food snacks, is called pani puri,

00:19:52.072 --> 00:19:53.665
which are little puris, which are little

00:19:53.665 --> 00:19:56.786
crispy fritters, which are hollow,

00:19:56.786 --> 00:19:58.347
and they're filled with a combination of

00:19:58.347 --> 00:20:02.560
chickpeas and a, like,
spiced fragrant water.

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:03.393
Thank you.

00:20:07.664 --> 00:20:09.736
So this is the pani puri,

00:20:09.736 --> 00:20:11.647
and the outside is the puri,

00:20:11.647 --> 00:20:13.413
and then inside is chickpeas,

00:20:13.413 --> 00:20:14.899
and then he fills it with some,

00:20:14.899 --> 00:20:16.667
I think there's tamarind water

00:20:16.667 --> 00:20:19.913
as well as like some minty water,

00:20:19.913 --> 00:20:20.946
well, actually, I'll find out,

00:20:20.946 --> 00:20:22.318
but you eat them by the single,

00:20:22.318 --> 00:20:23.214
and you've gotta eat them fast

00:20:23.214 --> 00:20:25.547
before they go soggy on you.

00:20:28.548 --> 00:20:29.381
Mm.

00:20:32.195 --> 00:20:33.612
Oh, it's amazing.

00:20:35.161 --> 00:20:37.578
It just explodes with juices.

00:20:40.345 --> 00:20:43.591
It's salty, it's a little bit spicy,

00:20:43.591 --> 00:20:45.822
you can taste like, a little bit

00:20:45.822 --> 00:20:47.989
of like a minty freshness,

00:20:49.065 --> 00:20:51.102
and then you have like the starchy

00:20:51.102 --> 00:20:52.193
chickpeas in there as well,

00:20:52.193 --> 00:20:55.183
all wrapped up by like a hollow chip.

00:20:55.183 --> 00:20:57.041
Oh, it's good, and once
you finish one bite,

00:20:57.041 --> 00:20:58.708
you get another one.

00:21:05.864 --> 00:21:06.697
Thank you.

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:12.933
Mm.

00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:17.553
It's such a genius snack.

00:21:19.777 --> 00:21:23.444
I would never think to
add liquid to a chip,

00:21:24.808 --> 00:21:26.898
but it works so incredibly well.

00:21:26.898 --> 00:21:29.254
What I love about it most, I think,

00:21:29.254 --> 00:21:31.233
I probably have some driplets of

00:21:31.233 --> 00:21:35.185
the pani puri water going down my chin.

00:21:35.185 --> 00:21:38.585
It's so flavorful, and it
just sort of explodes with,

00:21:38.585 --> 00:21:41.568
yeah, it explodes with spice and flavor,

00:21:41.568 --> 00:21:43.818
and it's a wonderful snack.

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:55.213
Mm.

00:21:56.688 --> 00:21:58.928
It's both a little bit sweet,

00:21:58.928 --> 00:22:01.345
but salty and spicy, more so.

00:22:02.854 --> 00:22:04.157
It's wonderful, I think I have

00:22:04.157 --> 00:22:07.218
a couple left more in my set.

00:22:07.218 --> 00:22:10.218
(speaking in Hindi)

00:22:21.765 --> 00:22:23.335
And then when you're done
eating your pani puri,

00:22:23.335 --> 00:22:24.637
you have some water at the bottom

00:22:24.637 --> 00:22:26.142
that has fallen out of your puri,

00:22:26.142 --> 00:22:27.809
so you can drink it.

00:22:31.238 --> 00:22:33.626
It's so refreshing,

00:22:33.626 --> 00:22:36.222
it's almost like drinking mint juice,

00:22:36.222 --> 00:22:38.875
but with the tamarind
sweetness, and nice and salty.

00:22:38.875 --> 00:22:40.042
Oh, thank you.

00:22:42.693 --> 00:22:44.276
Oh, one more, okay.

00:22:48.568 --> 00:22:51.318
Next up, he handed me a dry puri.

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.703
Mm, yeah, that's good too.

00:22:58.703 --> 00:23:03.558
That tastes like a chip
with bean dip in the middle.

00:23:03.558 --> 00:23:05.868
That pani puri was superb,

00:23:05.868 --> 00:23:07.490
and they have sign that says they use

00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:10.988
fresh filtered water, so that's great,

00:23:10.988 --> 00:23:13.391
because it's definitely a snack that

00:23:13.391 --> 00:23:15.126
you need to be careful eating

00:23:15.126 --> 00:23:18.025
because of the water
content, but it's so good.

00:23:18.025 --> 00:23:19.911
It's such a genius combination,

00:23:19.911 --> 00:23:22.354
but now I'm so thirsty right now,

00:23:22.354 --> 00:23:24.240
I need a big bottle of water,

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:25.714
so there's a stall right over here

00:23:25.714 --> 00:23:29.297
that I'm gonna grab a
bottle of water from.

00:23:30.146 --> 00:23:30.979
Thank you.

00:23:34.733 --> 00:23:35.566
How much is it?

00:23:35.566 --> 00:23:36.983
- Twenty, twenty.

00:23:45.024 --> 00:23:46.024
- Thank you.

00:23:46.893 --> 00:23:48.372
I have been sweating all day long,

00:23:48.372 --> 00:23:50.765
and haven't drank that much water,

00:23:50.765 --> 00:23:53.379
but after eating a salty
snack like pani puri,

00:23:53.379 --> 00:23:55.379
I am feeling the thirst.

00:24:03.842 --> 00:24:06.675
Ah, cold water, tastes incredible.

00:24:08.689 --> 00:24:10.518
As I was drinking that water,

00:24:10.518 --> 00:24:13.348
all of a sudden we heard
like a roar of people,

00:24:13.348 --> 00:24:15.112
just like a whole stampede of people

00:24:15.112 --> 00:24:17.065
running this way because
it started downpouring

00:24:17.065 --> 00:24:18.703
all of a sudden again, so we are standing

00:24:18.703 --> 00:24:22.203
underneath an umbrella, underneath a tree,

00:24:24.142 --> 00:24:27.141
but it's a fast rain,
like it rained really hard

00:24:27.141 --> 00:24:31.505
for about one minute, and
now it's stopping again.

00:24:31.505 --> 00:24:34.505
(speaking in Hindi)

00:24:35.495 --> 00:24:38.662
(mellow Indian music)

00:24:42.045 --> 00:24:45.045
(speaking in Hindi)

00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:56.463
- [Mark] Colaba.

00:24:58.059 --> 00:25:01.226
(mellow Indian music)

00:25:05.626 --> 00:25:07.485
We took that taxi over to,

00:25:07.485 --> 00:25:09.531
or very close to where we
started off this morning,

00:25:09.531 --> 00:25:12.323
where our hotel is, and
we are going to go to

00:25:12.323 --> 00:25:16.490
the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj
Vastu Sangrahalaya museum,

00:25:17.969 --> 00:25:20.951
which is, we have just arrived right here.

00:25:20.951 --> 00:25:24.440
It's pretty expensive to
visit, at 500 Rupees entrance,

00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:26.768
and then they also charge for photography.

00:25:26.768 --> 00:25:28.544
Inside, it was pretty interesting.

00:25:28.544 --> 00:25:30.753
There are all sorts of
different exhibitions

00:25:30.753 --> 00:25:33.242
about the history of India.

00:25:33.242 --> 00:25:36.588
Definitely my favorite
exhibition was the sculpture,

00:25:36.588 --> 00:25:39.042
where there are ancient sculptures,

00:25:39.042 --> 00:25:41.738
especially rock carvings,
and also what I really liked

00:25:41.738 --> 00:25:42.843
about this museum is just

00:25:42.843 --> 00:25:45.858
the actual museum structure itself.

00:25:45.858 --> 00:25:48.008
It kind of has a gothic feel to it,

00:25:48.008 --> 00:25:50.527
but then at the same time,
the dome really looks like

00:25:50.527 --> 00:25:52.940
it has Islamic influence,

00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:56.956
and I know the architect
who designed this building,

00:25:56.956 --> 00:26:00.635
or this structure, also
designed the Gateway of India.

00:26:00.635 --> 00:26:03.493
For our final attraction
stop this afternoon,

00:26:03.493 --> 00:26:05.118
we are taking the walk, it's just about

00:26:05.118 --> 00:26:06.847
a five minute walk from the museum

00:26:06.847 --> 00:26:08.847
to the Gateway of India.

00:26:11.494 --> 00:26:13.361
We entered into the main entrance

00:26:13.361 --> 00:26:15.282
of the Gateway of India, but they were

00:26:15.282 --> 00:26:17.754
pretty strict about no video,

00:26:17.754 --> 00:26:19.325
so I was told not to video,

00:26:19.325 --> 00:26:21.763
so now we're gonna try to go around

00:26:21.763 --> 00:26:24.833
to the outside to get a view of it.

00:26:24.833 --> 00:26:26.901
If you walk down the road a little ways,

00:26:26.901 --> 00:26:30.039
there's some great views
of the Gateway of India,

00:26:30.039 --> 00:26:34.175
and then also on this side
is the Taj Palace Hotel,

00:26:34.175 --> 00:26:38.092
which is also a very
famous landmark in Mumbai.

00:26:39.279 --> 00:26:43.029
I can smell the aroma
of meat as we approach.

00:26:45.638 --> 00:26:48.638
(speaking in Hindi)

00:27:00.677 --> 00:27:02.220
This restaurant, which happens to be

00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:04.395
literally right around the corner from

00:27:04.395 --> 00:27:06.160
the hotel where we're staying at,

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:08.291
is called Bademiya, and they are

00:27:08.291 --> 00:27:10.809
very, very well known
throughout all of Mumbai

00:27:10.809 --> 00:27:14.213
for serving kebabs and all sorts of

00:27:14.213 --> 00:27:16.706
non-vegetarian food, although they do

00:27:16.706 --> 00:27:19.112
have a vegetarian
section, separate section,

00:27:19.112 --> 00:27:22.269
but most of what they serve
is all sorts of grilled meat.

00:27:22.269 --> 00:27:23.436
Oh, thank you.

00:27:26.455 --> 00:27:28.167
I kind of got a little bit confused,

00:27:28.167 --> 00:27:29.776
because I wasn't sure if we were gonna

00:27:29.776 --> 00:27:31.374
just stand outside, it's very common

00:27:31.374 --> 00:27:33.461
for you to just stand
outside and order the rolls,

00:27:33.461 --> 00:27:35.382
and just stand on the street and eat,

00:27:35.382 --> 00:27:38.502
but then they have this huge dining room,

00:27:38.502 --> 00:27:40.208
which is actually quite nice to sit down,

00:27:40.208 --> 00:27:42.061
and it kind of feels
like you're in a fort,

00:27:42.061 --> 00:27:45.762
so the reason that my
food is on to go ware

00:27:45.762 --> 00:27:47.657
is because I thought we
were just going to stand,

00:27:47.657 --> 00:27:48.866
but then we decided to sit.

00:27:48.866 --> 00:27:51.836
I'm going to go ahead and begin
with the mutton seekh kabab,

00:27:51.836 --> 00:27:54.160
and these are freshly grilled,

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:56.611
oh, just fingers of meat.

00:27:56.611 --> 00:27:58.940
Add some of this chutney,
and that looks like,

00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:02.288
maybe like a mint chutney,
and with some onions,

00:28:02.288 --> 00:28:05.788
and I'm just going in straight meat steak.

00:28:11.781 --> 00:28:15.114
Oh yeah, kebabs do it for me every time.

00:28:16.256 --> 00:28:19.137
The flavor of the smoke that is just

00:28:19.137 --> 00:28:22.130
embedded into that minced meat is amazing.

00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:23.688
And actually, it does taste,

00:28:23.688 --> 00:28:26.419
the meat kind of tastes lean,
it doesn't taste too oily,

00:28:26.419 --> 00:28:28.719
and you can also taste a
lot of onions in there,

00:28:28.719 --> 00:28:31.719
and maybe some kind of like parsley,

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:36.390
and that sauce is a
little bit spicy as well.

00:28:39.637 --> 00:28:40.470
Oh yeah.

00:28:43.753 --> 00:28:47.511
I'm a little bit obsessed with kebabs.

00:28:47.511 --> 00:28:49.984
They are very well known for their rolls,

00:28:49.984 --> 00:28:52.229
and they make the bread fresh,

00:28:52.229 --> 00:28:53.613
and so if you had a,

00:28:53.613 --> 00:28:56.018
it's like an upside dome
with a fire underneath it,

00:28:56.018 --> 00:28:58.468
and he spread out the dough
and they put it on there,

00:28:58.468 --> 00:29:00.617
and it cooks just in a couple seconds,

00:29:00.617 --> 00:29:02.845
and I ordered the chicken bhuna roll.

00:29:02.845 --> 00:29:05.419
Oh actually, I think I should
not actually unravel it,

00:29:05.419 --> 00:29:07.839
I think we're supposed to tear it, tear,

00:29:07.839 --> 00:29:11.422
so you don't lose any
juices on the bottom.

00:29:12.871 --> 00:29:16.538
Oh yeah, that's a much
better way to eat it.

00:29:25.899 --> 00:29:28.732
That bread, that bread is amazing.

00:29:29.574 --> 00:29:32.058
It's really very similar to a tortilla,

00:29:32.058 --> 00:29:35.029
then that's like shredded chicken,

00:29:35.029 --> 00:29:37.612
with kind of a tomato-y, spicy,

00:29:40.614 --> 00:29:42.614
kind of yeah, sauce, mm.

00:29:43.581 --> 00:29:46.538
Yeah, that is, that is a comfort roll.

00:29:46.538 --> 00:29:48.171
What I am gonna attempt to do though

00:29:48.171 --> 00:29:51.421
is add some more sauce and some onions,

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:56.310
and scoop that on there, oh yeah.

00:30:03.094 --> 00:30:05.477
And since we're sitting
here, I could not resist

00:30:05.477 --> 00:30:07.878
ordering another piece of chicken,

00:30:07.878 --> 00:30:10.086
and it is just, you can just see it

00:30:10.086 --> 00:30:13.836
coated in flavor and
then grilled to a crisp.

00:30:18.116 --> 00:30:19.688
What I like about the chicken is that

00:30:19.688 --> 00:30:22.349
you can really taste the grill flavor,

00:30:22.349 --> 00:30:25.462
it has an amazing roasted flavor.

00:30:25.462 --> 00:30:28.993
The good news is I asked
for a refill on the sauce,

00:30:28.993 --> 00:30:31.036
so he gave me a whole plate of

00:30:31.036 --> 00:30:33.687
both the red sauce and the
green sauce with some onions.

00:30:33.687 --> 00:30:36.937
This will taste great with the chicken.

00:30:39.487 --> 00:30:42.209
Those onions, too, just
enhance everything,

00:30:42.209 --> 00:30:44.621
and the reason I didn't order more bread,

00:30:44.621 --> 00:30:46.855
apart from the roll, is because

00:30:46.855 --> 00:30:48.184
Ing and I are actually both

00:30:48.184 --> 00:30:49.777
still kind of hungry from lunch,

00:30:49.777 --> 00:30:53.008
lunch was a big meal, so yeah,

00:30:53.008 --> 00:30:56.925
I'm sticking to mostly
protein for this dinner.

00:30:57.903 --> 00:31:00.466
All the food I tried was very good.

00:31:00.466 --> 00:31:03.561
The chicken leg was
maybe a little bit dry,

00:31:03.561 --> 00:31:06.659
but I think probably,
definitely my favorite thing

00:31:06.659 --> 00:31:09.214
was the chicken bhuna roll.

00:31:09.214 --> 00:31:11.539
That is insanely good, that's something

00:31:11.539 --> 00:31:13.555
you have to eat here, and I am down to

00:31:13.555 --> 00:31:15.389
my last bite right now.

00:31:15.389 --> 00:31:17.842
It is the wonderful last bite,

00:31:17.842 --> 00:31:21.637
where all the oils have all
accumulated at the bottom,

00:31:21.637 --> 00:31:25.804
and so definitely, the final
bite is always the best.

00:31:30.962 --> 00:31:31.795
Mm, mm.

00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:38.537
That is a must eat in Mumbai.

00:31:41.575 --> 00:31:42.908
Okay, thank you.

00:31:45.455 --> 00:31:46.288
Thank you.

00:31:50.965 --> 00:31:52.015
Okay.

00:31:52.015 --> 00:31:54.550
That was a highly satisfying dinner,

00:31:54.550 --> 00:31:58.204
and that is gonna be the
last thing I do today

00:31:58.204 --> 00:32:00.310
before I go straight to bed.

00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:02.596
I have to admit, I'm pretty wiped out.

00:32:02.596 --> 00:32:04.846
It has been a hot and busy,

00:32:06.532 --> 00:32:09.988
and just a fantastic first day in Mumbai,

00:32:09.988 --> 00:32:11.941
so I'm gonna end the video right now.

00:32:11.941 --> 00:32:14.086
Thank you all very much for watching.

00:32:14.086 --> 00:32:15.545
Thank you.

00:32:15.545 --> 00:32:17.682
And I just got another napkin,

00:32:17.682 --> 00:32:19.270
and please remember to give this video

00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:21.323
a thumbs up if you enjoyed it,

00:32:21.323 --> 00:32:26.177
and leave a comment below,
and oh, another napkin,

00:32:26.177 --> 00:32:27.606
and also make sure you subscribe

00:32:27.606 --> 00:32:29.457

00:32:29.457 --> 00:32:31.748
and I will see you on the next video.

00:32:31.748 --> 00:32:35.284
Tomorrow is another
beautiful day in Mumbai.

00:32:35.284 --> 00:32:38.701
(rhythmic drum music)
