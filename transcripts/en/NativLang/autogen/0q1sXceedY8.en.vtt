perspective you might check if a
sentence is grammatical by asking a

sentence is grammatical by asking a
 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.030
sentence is grammatical by asking a
native speaker to judge the sentence or

this point is to treat it as a set of

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190
this point is to treat it as a set of
 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.400
this point is to treat it as a set of
rules which allows you either to

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410
rules which allows you either to
 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.030
rules which allows you either to
accurately describe or produce sentences

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040

in a specific language the first topic

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880
in a specific language the first topic
 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.930
in a specific language the first topic
we'll look at is a clause a clause is in

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940
we'll look at is a clause a clause is in
 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.630
we'll look at is a clause a clause is in
some ways a kernel sentence it usually

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640
some ways a kernel sentence it usually
 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.880
some ways a kernel sentence it usually
has a finite verb which means that the

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890
has a finite verb which means that the
 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.499
has a finite verb which means that the
verb reflects something about the

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509
verb reflects something about the
 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:23.710
verb reflects something about the
subject the doer of the action it

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720
subject the doer of the action it
 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.469
subject the doer of the action it
usually has tense or aspect some way of

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479
usually has tense or aspect some way of
 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.780
usually has tense or aspect some way of
indicating when or how the action takes

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790
indicating when or how the action takes
 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.359
indicating when or how the action takes
place clauses don't have to have a

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369
place clauses don't have to have a
 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:33.850
place clauses don't have to have a
finite verb a small clause is often

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860
finite verb a small clause is often
 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.430
finite verb a small clause is often
based around an infinitive an example of

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440
based around an infinitive an example of
 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.040
based around an infinitive an example of
a small clauses to go to the store and

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050
a small clauses to go to the store and
 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.590
a small clauses to go to the store and
that small clause might be embedded into

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600
that small clause might be embedded into
 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.810
that small clause might be embedded into
another clause we'll talk about

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820
another clause we'll talk about
 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.880
another clause we'll talk about
embedding later but one example is I

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890
embedding later but one example is I
 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.710
embedding later but one example is I
want to go to the store so want is the

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720
want to go to the store so want is the
 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.870
want to go to the store so want is the
finite verb in the main clause and the

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880
finite verb in the main clause and the
 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.359
finite verb in the main clause and the
main Clause can be I want it or in this

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369
main Clause can be I want it or in this
 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:57.639
main Clause can be I want it or in this
case I want to go to the store and

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649
case I want to go to the store and
 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:59.740
case I want to go to the store and
that's the main clause or the matrix

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750
that's the main clause or the matrix
 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.960
that's the main clause or the matrix
clause or the independent clause because

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970
clause or the independent clause because
 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.100
clause or the independent clause because
you will find it on its own

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110
you will find it on its own
 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.770
you will find it on its own
a dependent clause will often have some

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780
a dependent clause will often have some
 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.380
a dependent clause will often have some
introductory word like that or if and

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390
introductory word like that or if and
 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.510
introductory word like that or if and
this allows you to identify the clause

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520
this allows you to identify the clause
 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.090
this allows you to identify the clause
as needing to be put within another

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100
as needing to be put within another
 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.770
as needing to be put within another
clause in order to form a complete

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780
clause in order to form a complete
 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.200
clause in order to form a complete
sentence

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210
sentence
 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.820
sentence
this has been a very simple introduction

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830
this has been a very simple introduction
 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.830
this has been a very simple introduction
to dependent clauses and independent

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840
to dependent clauses and independent
 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.560
to dependent clauses and independent
clauses but keep these in mind as we

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570
clauses but keep these in mind as we
 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.330
clauses but keep these in mind as we
start to build more sentences in the

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340
start to build more sentences in the
 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:32.930
start to build more sentences in the
next lesson

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940
