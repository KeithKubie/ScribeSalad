Speaker 1:          00:01          Listening to radiolab

Speaker 2:          00:03          radio from W. N y. S. C. E. N. N. P. R. Maybe all of us can sit on the couch. You can do, I can rock and pull that chair over. So we're going to start with the story from my producer, Pat Walters about a couple, oh my word. It's the lady. I'm Janet. This is the guy, I don't need you to introduce yourself. That's usually the thing we do, but we're not telling people who you are. We're going to call him Kevin. Kevin, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's, yeah, that's my name. That's suspicious at all.

Speaker 1:          00:35          It's not as real name. I'll make sense why we're not using his real name in a second.

Speaker 2:          00:39          Okay. You know, so this one starts a few summers ago. It was July, 2006. Jan and Kevin were at home and uh, some people you don't know show up and maybe out start with you

Speaker 1:          00:51          when they show up at their door. So we were, it was a, we were getting ready to go down the shore. It was a Friday. So we, so we're in the kitchen and, and they come to the back door.

Speaker 2:          01:00          I thought the, I thought that they were fundraising. I thought they might've been firemen just by, you know, the, the blue shirt, the blue shirt, and then realized that, uh, that they were, they were law enforcement

Speaker 3:          01:10          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          01:11          two women and a, I think two men more came up from around the, you know, the side of the house and they show us their badges. Were they cops or they were homeland security. They took me outside and they kept me and they asked me to stay in the kitchen and they had a, a woman with me. I didn't know what was going on. Nobody said anything.

Speaker 2:          01:30          What are they saying to you on the porch? Meanwhile, when they, when they showed up, like out to the door, you said, you know why we're here. I said, yeah, I do. I was expecting you

Speaker 3:          01:43          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          01:43          and I showed them where everything was.

Speaker 1:          01:48          This story about Kevin and his wife, Janet inspired us to do the entire hour because one of the most basic things that we do as people is we judge, we judge one another, could judge what's right, judge what's wrong. But this story and the two that follow, they will make you judge how you judge or at least they had that effect on us. We're calling our show, blame them. Jad Abumrad I'm Robert Krulwich and we'll go back to bat. Before we do, you should know that this show contains some graphic difficult descriptions in a few spots. If you're not in the mood or if you have kids around, you might want to sit this one out.

Speaker 2:          02:26          Okay. So what happened in that first scene and what happens next? Only makes sense. If we go back a little first about 15 years, it's just an ordinary day. Kevin's going home from work and um, I was driving home going about 65 70 in the fast lane when suddenly there was a thump in my chest. Then he just a heat boating. After that, he said suddenly he had this thickness

Speaker 4:          03:00          in my tongue. In my throat than about taste in his mouth. Then

Speaker 2:          03:05          my hearing faded out. Any thoughts? It's back when I finally did come to, uh, he sees his car smashed into the side of an apartment building. I do recall the officers telling, you know, you've been in an accident, you've been in an, and he remembers one of them insisted that he smelled alcohol and I was talking through clenched teeth cause I had bit my tongue and uh, and my cheeks. I was saying over and over again, I had a seizure, I had a seizure. [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          03:40          Kevin's got epilepsy. He's had it since he was a teenager, but two years before this all happened, he'd had surgery to remove the part of his brain that was causing the seizures and it seemed to have worked. He was doing great and essentially wasn't having seizures anymore until suddenly you,

Speaker 2:          03:58          he was last year license. I lost my license for a year. Things had kind of taken a nosedive. Like here he is, he's 35 years old. I'm living with my brother, I'm divorced and I have to call my daddy and ask him now to drive me to and from work and you think I need to do something. This is not sustainable. No, no, don't, don't need that. So I walked into the office as HR person where he works for a list of all the employees, give me a list of everybody and where they're from. So she pulled it up, I go down the list and I get to Janet Woodruff, Bloomfield, only one that's really close to me five minutes away. So I walk to her cube, knocked on the, on the wall and uh, introduced myself like, Hey, my name is Kevin. I also work here. I've, I've got this thing though. It's kind of awkward. I, I can't drive. And I was wondering if you'd give me a ride. And uh, she said yes.

Speaker 5:          04:58          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          04:58          I really passed by his street. I mean, on the way it works. So it was like right on history pretty much. But I made it clear, you know, I'll do it when I can. And as they drove together, they started talking, finding out a little bit more about each other. Notice pretty quickly we liked the same music and that was unique because I sort of liked music that was probably more in his error. Kevin was seven years older than Jan. What kind of music are you listening to? Jackson Brown, mostly. Lot of Jackson Brown, James Taylor [inaudible] um, funny rate. It's a little, you know, Elton John, they found themselves

Speaker 2:          05:36          singing along to the lyrics. You cannot sing with somebody day in and day out and not have something happened.

Speaker 1:          05:42          We wound up as a spring came, you know, it's getting nice out. So now it's like, well let's not go home. Let's go out for a beer after work. We're becoming good friends. We liked each other. But for Kevin it was a little more serious than that. I'm thinking about her starting to wake up at night and one day in as Jenna is dropping

Speaker 2:          05:58          him off, Kevin turns to her and he says, Hey, I really appreciate what you've done for me. Let me take you to dinner. Just as friends, just as friends. Jen said, sure. So May 30th, 1992 Highland pavilion. Nicest restaurant in town,

Speaker 1:          06:11          so your friends takes you to a four star restaurant. You're thinking right away he thinks this is a date or going on a date. Come on. So now on panic stricken, we have our dinner, we leave. We had a wonderful time. Sure.

Speaker 2:          06:21          He drops me off and I handed her the poem. What did the poem say? You still have it? Yeah, I do. Okay. This is a little slower. Each time we sing on the way home, I pray that traffic backs up so we can sing together just a little longer and the harmony can go on forever and each time we reach my door I feel robbed because we're always in mid song or mid thought. If only I could. He gets out and goes inside and probably thinks, ah, Sam. They gave her that poem. She's going to be so smitten with me and you go home and what

Speaker 1:          06:56          want to throw up. I just thought, Oh God, I, you know, next day I just looked at him and said, listen, we got to clarify. This is clearly just going to be a friendship. He was seven years older than me. He had these, uh, brain, uh, you know, surgery. He has epilepsy, he's divorced. He has two children in here. You're catching the compassion here too. I'm trying and he's just like, I'm not asking you to marry me. I'm asking you to go out on a few days.

Speaker 2:          07:22          Exactly. If you go out with me like four times in the next six months, I'm ahead of the game.

Speaker 1:          07:26          He just handled it and I don't think it was long at all. I can't even remember. But it wasn't long at all before we were like a couple

Speaker 5:          07:33          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          07:37          hey Kevin, I'm dopey. Dopey in love. Oh yeah. Yeah. Doing romantic things for her all the time. Flowers, poems and paintings. Illustration of the Jackson Brown cover. And within a year we were engaged,

Speaker 2:          07:52          but all the while Kevin is having seizures. Yeah. Since the car accident more and more, there was a point where we were obviously dating, she helping him make his bed and um, he said she pulled off the pillow case. It's covered with bloodstains and one, two, three, four, five, six of you can count the number of seizures that I had in between my tongue and bled.

Speaker 1:          08:15          I knew nothing about epilepsy. I had never seen anybody have a seizure in my past. Those would have been big red flags that I would have just walked away. But I just went with it

Speaker 2:          08:23          and they both went with it for a few years until finally Kevin and Jan decide this is enough. I wanted to be done with it. I just needed to be done with it. So they schedule a brain surgery,

Speaker 6:          08:35          uh,

Speaker 2:          08:37          which sounds like a big deal and obviously it is, but they had every reason to think that this wouldn't change him.

Speaker 1:          08:43          I honestly thought that he was going to come out of it fine. Better

Speaker 2:          08:47          cause that's what happened the first time. Kevin had actually gone through a brain surgery much like this one once before and he'd come out pretty much the same guy. He was still himself. In fact, he made sure of it. I had a, I was awake for the surgery and that's crazy. Yeah, it was. I had to be awake. I had to do with music.

Speaker 5:          09:09          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          09:10          Kevin is a musician and the doctors told him, they said that if I lost anything, I was going to lose my appreciation for music, that it would be like music would be white noise. I said, you know, no. For me music was no is part of my personality. It was how I coped with my darkest moments in dealing with epilepsy and seizures. At 18 years old, I'd have a seizure, I take my harmonica and I'd find a place with decent reverb somewhere and be right where I needed to be. I didn't want to lose that part of me. So as the doctors were doing the brain surgery, they had his head open. They asked him to sing. You remember what you're saying? Um, and do the innocence, some James Taylor and while he's saying they would tickle different parts of his brain and if to ever touch the part that made him stop singing, they'd say, okay, that's a part we can not take out. Wow. Yeah. And in the end, I think they ended up taking out like four and a half centimeters, like a gall, you know, a little bit bigger than a golf ball. Wow. But afterwards, as he was recovering, I had my keyboard in the room and I tried playing right away, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh.

Speaker 1:          10:19          And it works. The part of him that he really cared about was still there. Exactly. Yeah, it does it man. I fell in love with after the first surgery, so I thought, well, you know, now that you've got to do a second surgery, he's already been there on this road, we're fine. And after that second surgery, he did seem fine. Janet didn't have her brother sneak my, my keyboard up to the room again. He was very, very adamant that he wanted the keyboard and play it a little

Speaker 5:          10:45          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          10:45          just noodled a couple of notes, played a couple of things and it was like, okay, I'm there, still me. I was ready to go. So you go home and like it seems to have worked.

Speaker 1:          10:56          Yeah. As far as seizures go, we thought, okay, this is it. We're home free. And uh, I was just happy to have some normalcy. But then

Speaker 2:          11:03          in the winter, right by beginning the middle of January, Kevin noticed he wanted to eat my physical appetite a lot more than usual. Like insane.

Speaker 1:          11:11          This is a guy who didn't eat breakfast. He had minimal lunch. You need having sensible dinner, maybe a snack. That was it. But now I could eat the couch. It just was odd. It was not him normally, but you know, you're like, okay, maybe it's just a side effect from the medications. But then the piano

Speaker 5:          11:27          [inaudible] he played

Speaker 1:          11:28          the piano for hours. Same songs. They used to sing in the car together. He has stuck on a piece. He would play for hours. How many hours? Eight. Eight, nine. And then there was sex, you know, we were happy, healthy couple. Kevin's nodding. Yeah. Yeah, it was fine. But what was abnormal was it was, it was anywhere. Clearly. It wasn't like, oh, we're in the supermarket, let's have sex here. I mean, it wasn't like that, but I mean it was, I could just walk in the kitchen from being out of work and he'd be like, Oh, let's go here. Which struck her as weird. But then again, we were thinking, you know, let's try to have a family. So the timing made things confusing and more than that, it wasn't like any of this stuff was out of character. Exactly. In fact, it was all stuff that she liked about him. Yeah. Except now it was all turned up to 11. All the things that were wonderful became chores

Speaker 2:          12:21          and that's pretty much where things are at. When those federal agents showed up in July of 2006, I was just completely blindsided. I said, you know why we're here. I said, yeah, I do. I was expecting yet Kevin took the agents upstairs. I took them right into here where my computer was and they arrested him for what was on that computer. I gave it up to him right away and warning, uh, this next passage contained some graphic imagery. I mean, I, I hadn't, I don't know if I had fully, like I think I had just like let child porn be this kind of vague thing that meant as someone younger than 18, but then I read some of the court documents and they were like toddlers. They were picked videos of two, three, and four year olds. They're there. These sites had the most despicable, disgusting things you can, you can imagine infants on throw, um, you know, pre preteen and you know, pre-adolescent you know, in a, in adolescence. Yeah. So yeah, it, and you bought these things and put them on your computer. I, yeah. Yeah. It, it, it bothers me. Yeah. It bothers me.

Speaker 2:          13:36          Like, uh, like I said, initially it was, you know, it was just your base, your basic, you know, Hetero Heteros, heterosexual playboy, like penthouse, like sites. And then windows would just start to open up and pretty soon he says he was going everywhere there was gay sex. They were, I mean, there was, there was bondage, there was a dedication. Sex, there was animal sex, xeno sex. I went everywhere that a button came up to push. I, I still don't understand it. I still, I still don't understand it. He said it disturbed you and you feel terrible. But I just like wonder like, how do you, do you tell yourself like, that wasn't me. Like how do you explain it to yourself too so that you can kind of, I dunno, not feeling like you're as bad as the person who goes there without a brain injury is, you know, like, oh Aye. Aye. Aye. Say that again. Ask that question. I guess I'm just wondering, I don't know. Like knowing that that's a thing that you did and it sounds like obviously you know that that was bad. It was a wrong thing. And so what terrible thing. Um, but it was, it was you who did it or was it not? I Dunno. You know what I mean? Now it, it was, it was me who did it, but it was me with,

Speaker 3:          15:01          hey,

Speaker 2:          15:01          complete lack of neurological control.

Speaker 2:          15:08          Yeah. I mean, I, I, I know, I know who I am. I did idiotic things that I couldn't stop myself from doing. I didn't want to do it. There would be nights where it would be four or five, six hours of going to the same site and and, and downloading one or two files and then deleting them, going back a minute later, downloading the same files, deleting them. I would download those files a dozen times and delete them a dozen times cause I didn't want to be there and knew I shouldn't be there and couldn't help myself from going back. I'm not an idiot. I mean I'm, I'm, I'm a smart guy. I'm not an idiot, but I know I had no control

Speaker 4:          15:50          and that's what he would argue in court. Can we plead guilty? But at the sentencing hearing he asked the judge to be lenient, arguing essentially that the person who did all those things in some sense wasn't him. It was some other part of his brain that he couldn't control that the hearing, he called one witness,

Speaker 2:          16:07          Orrin Devinsky. I'm a neurologist and epilepsy specialist at NYU Medical Center. He's been treating Kevin for decades, 2020 some odd years. And he says as soon as he found out what Kevin had been doing had a terrible sense of of responsibility. This is because of the brain surgery, the surgery Oren recommended he have any argued in court that this was not Kevin's fault. I remember looking at those agents right in their face and saying to them and to the judge, this could be anybody. This could be those agents, judge, this could be you, this could be me, this could be anybody and we would have no control over what we did it and explained to the court what the biology was

Speaker 4:          16:49          [inaudible] that the way the brain is organized, that there are parts of our brain that are way deep down that control. Blake base desires. Hunger. Sex keeps US alive, but it's teeming with the nastiest thoughts. We all have these crazy thoughts in our head now and most of us, those thoughts are kept in check because there are other parts of our brain that sit on top and act like a lid. But in Kevin's case, the brain surgeon who did that surgery removed part of that filter and suddenly the cork was off.

Speaker 2:          17:19          I mean it was just no lid on. His sexual desires

Speaker 4:          17:26          is that scientist have known about it, about

Speaker 2:          17:27          this condition for a long time. If her son, monkeys in rhesus monkeys, when the monkeys would lose roughly the same part of the brain that Kevin lost, they became very hypersexual males that would only previously be sexually involved with females. Now we're 10 times more sexually active with both males and females that it feels to me, it feels to me like there's a, there would be a brighter line before kids, you know, I think there is a line for quote unquote normal individuals, but in a brain disorder case, those lines get blurred and he told the court that's what happened here. It was black and white. Kevin was sick and his behavior was out of his control. Well, that's not what the facts showed in this case. This is Lee Barton who was the prosecutor. We saw no evidence of impulsivity. He says, if you're claiming that he had no control, that his brain made him do it, then how come he had all this child porn on his home computer?

Speaker 2:          18:23          I believe it was 52 videos and 125 images, and yet on his work computer, they were zero images, zero videos of child pornography on his work computer, and he worked a lot. He held down a job. He was working every day. If he truly lacked impulse control, I would think you would see child pornography on both computers. And so what he argued back was what was the lid on at work and off at home? Seems to me to be an easy out. So the answer is that this is common with neurologic disease. They tend not to be 24 seven is let's take something like Tourette's. Some people, when they're engaged in playing sports, they tend not to have ticks, whereas when they're sitting around bored or stressed, they do tend to have ticks. So you could say, well, Therese clearly isn't a neurological disorder, but note Tourette's is a neurologic disorder. We understand some of the brain things that go on Tourette's. The prosecution didn't buy it. They just thought it was hogwash. What was hogwash was his level of certainty,

Speaker 7:          19:25          um,

Speaker 2:          19:25          depressed skis and asked the Kevin be sent to prison for five years, isn't paying for child porn. He was supporting an industry that does terrible things to kids. Kevin hope t to avoid jail time altogether and instead be placed on house arrest. That was per Janet right after the arrest. I have to imagine that you were in shock a little like, yeah, she'd gone to see a lawyer and

Speaker 8:          19:50          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          19:50          one of the questions he asked was, is this marriage going to survive this? And I said, I don't know. And at that point, understanding, I didn't even know the level of pictures. Yeah. But she says the moment she heard orange state that this was a brain disorder with the name got Kluver BC syndrome. Once I was able to get that from me

Speaker 8:          20:12          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          20:13          it clicked. Like you couldn't blame it. We have these experts saying that it was a disease and I kept thinking they'll understand. Not to mention that after Kevin was arrested and got an unveil or, and gave him some medication and Janet says it was like flipping a switch. That's exactly what it was. It was like I got him back. I was able, I was able to sit and watch a movie with her, you know, normal. Janet actually says in a lot of ways, those few months between the arrest and the sentencing hearing, they'd been the best months of their marriage. He now is just so much easier, calmer. Uh, you could just talk, the hearing took about three hours and when it was over, the judge took a recess, went into her chambers. When she came back, she delivered her decision.

Speaker 3:          20:57          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          20:58          she actually wouldn't talk to me for the story, but I have the transcript from the, uh, hearing. And um, if you remember the prosecutor of the Bar, Tan was asking for five years, 63 months or in Kevin, Janet were hoping for house arrest, meaning no jail time. There's no way they're gonna put him in jail. This is clear cut. And here's what the judge does. She says, I do agree with orange. It is a neurological disorder, no question do we can't be held fully responsible for his behavior. She was getting it on the other and she said the prosecution did have a point that he was very much in control of his impulses, at least some of the time. And so the question for the judge was, how does the legal system assigned blame when a person is sometimes themselves and in control and sometimes not? Well, this was a crime. She said a crime which ultimately leads to children being harmed. And considering that you did have moments where you were in control, then in those moments you had a responsibility. You could've done something, you could have asked for help, you could have told the people around you what you were doing. So even if you couldn't have stopped yourself, they could have stopped you.

Speaker 2:          22:05          She made it very clear that we have to do something here. His sentence, 26 months at a federal prison and 25 months of house arrest. And I, I believe, I believe that she, she was, she was fair and I, I believe she was compassionate in about a week before Christmas in 2008 Janet drove him to prison. How long was he in jail for? About two years. And she was, even though the judge said, you know, he is responsible. Does that change her headed to, toward him at all? No, they totally stuck together. She visited him pretty much every weekend. The whole time

Speaker 1:          22:44          I knew the route and I had my own little routine down in between visit, she'd send up notes and I'll never forget, he could send me mail and they had a store where he could get some cards, super call murky and he would like alter them. And I remember the very first card I got, it was this very, you know, beautiful. Supposedly it's supposed to be beautiful, but it was like, you know, if you need anything, you know anything at all, just let me know. And then he writes, of course, if it's pressing, you might want to ask someone else because Oh well you can wait 24 months. And I remember getting that and just laughing and then that became our thing. Like, listen, this is a horrible situation, but we're going to make the best of it.

Speaker 2:          23:21          Tell me a little bit about like where things are at now.

Speaker 1:          23:25          I think things are, are, are almost normal. Yeah.
