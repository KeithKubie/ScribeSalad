00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.340
I have two identical
rectangles here,

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.910
and I want to measure how
much space each of them

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.360
take up on the
plane of my screen,

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.010
the screen that you are
looking at right now.

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:14.550
And I want to do it using
two different units.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.820
It's clear, since they're
two identical rectangles,

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.550
that they take up the
exact same amount of space.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.887
They will have the same area.

00:00:21.887 --> 00:00:23.720
But what we could see
it that we can measure

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.440
that area using different units.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.830
So first over here, let's
say that this figure

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.860
is 1 foot in width.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.820
And it is also 1 foot in height.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.640
So this right over here
is equal to 1 square foot.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.300
It's clearly a square.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.690
It has the same width
and the same height.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.490
And each of these
dimensions are 1 foot,

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.720
so we could call
it 1 square foot.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.250
So let's see how
many square feet

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.540
we can get onto one
of these rectangles,

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.870
and essentially we'll
be measuring its area

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.970
in terms of square feet.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.830
And so we want to
cover the entire space

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.440
without overlapping and without
going over the boundary.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:24.490
So that's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:39.760
6 in that first row, and then
I have 7, 8, 9 10, 11, and 12.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.490
So that looks like this area,
which is the same as this area

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.990
down here.

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.770
If I were to measure
it in square feet,

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.850
the area is equal to,
let me write this down,

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.050
the area is equal to, we
have-- let me write it down.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:02:02.910
We have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10, 11, 12 square feet.

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.580
12 square feet.

00:02:08.372 --> 00:02:10.330
Now, I'm going to try to
measure that same area

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.746
in a different
unit, and I'm going

00:02:11.746 --> 00:02:13.340
to just make up this unit.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.220
I'm going to call it a furgle.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.260
And a furgle in one dimension,
so a furgle in one dimension

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.170
is twice a foot.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.980
So that distance
right over here,

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.850
I'm going to call a furgle.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.829
That's one furgle.

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:27.370
This is something
that I made up just

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.900
for the purpose of this video.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.520
Most people will not
recognize what a furgle is.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.220
So its height is one furgle.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.020
Its width is a furgle.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:42.285
And so we could say that
this is 1 square furgle.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.290
So let's see how many
square furgles is

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.520
this area, that same area
that is 12 square feet.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.863
So let me copy and paste this.

00:02:54.863 --> 00:03:01.130
So let me copy, and then paste.

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.600
So let's see if we can get
one square furgle on there.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.380
We can get another
square furgle on there,

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.320
and we can get a third
square furgle on there.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.760
So we get 1, 2,
3 square furgles.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.880
The area of this figure in
furgles, square furgles,

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.030
I should say, area is
equal to 3 square furgles.

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.010
So it's the same exact area.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.530
3 square furgles is equal
to 12 square feet, covering

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.014
the exact same area.

00:03:37.014 --> 00:03:38.680
Now, what I encourage
you to think about

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.944
is how many square feet
make a square furgle?
