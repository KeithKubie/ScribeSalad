00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress, in Washington D.C.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.950
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Welcome
everybody, to the Kluge Center,

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.360
or right next to the
Kluge Center here

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.660
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.830
My names John Haskell
and I'm the director

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.420
of the Kluge Center.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.280
The center, just to give
you a little background,

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.260
was founded in 2000, based
on a very generous gift

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.500
from philanthropist
John W Kluge.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.900
And I'm going to read a couple
of lines from our charter

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.860
so you get a feel for what
purpose of the Kluge center is.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.010
Its mission is to quote,
reinvigorate the interconnection

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.990
between thought and action,

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.570
bridging the gap button
scholarship and policy making.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.050
So to that end, the
Kluge Center brings some

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.230
of the world's great thinkers
to the library to make use

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.050
of the collections and engage
in conversations like this one,

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.160
addressing the challenges facing
democracies in the 21st century.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.090
We also administer an award,
the Kluge Prize for Achievement

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.800
in the study of humanity.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.870
Which was recently
awarded, just last month,

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.550
to renowned historian

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.860
and outgoing Harvard
president Drew Gilpin Faust.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.200
I encourage you to visit our
website to get a boarder sense

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.730
of the different things
we're doing at Kluge,

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.500
with the residential scholars
and others, other things.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.750
As well as the fact that, if
you've visited the website

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.050
in the past, it's been,
also been reinvigorated

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.470
and it's readable
and navigable in ways

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:40.770
that is really quite exciting.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.220
And we also have a blog
on there called, Insights.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.780
And we regularly
have new blogs going.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.230
Either just boring
ones that I write

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.850
to update what Kluge is doing,

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.210
as well as more dynamic
ones written

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.880
by our scholars and our staff.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.930
Today's speaker, Sally
Gordon, was in residence

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.840
in the Kluge center last fall as
the, Cary and Ann Maguire Chair

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.770
in Ethics and American History.

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.210
This position was created to
enable a distinguished thinker

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.140
to spend a period of
residence at the Library,

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.280
using the collections and
exploring the history of America

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.700
with special attention
to ethical dimensions

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.190
of economic and social policy.

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:27.380
Although Mr. Maguire couldn't be
with us, we're very appreciative

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.900
of course of the
endowment of the Chair

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.410
and his generous donation.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.400
Which has attracted, really
some of the best scholars

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.360
in the field and it's been
a treasure for the Library.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.240
And in fact, two
of the librarians,

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.990
Dr. Carla's Hayden's scholarly
advisors, it's called the,

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.410
Scholar's Council, which
advises her and me.

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:52.510
Two of them were drawn from
the ranks of Maguire chairs.

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.050
So we're excited about that.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.260
Today's lecture by Sally is,
When Congress Taxed Churches,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.710
Religion and Politics
in District

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:01.490
of Columbia after the Civil War.

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.090
A little bit about Sally, she's
the Arlin M. Adams professor

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.260
of constitutional law and
also professor of history,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.860
at the University
of Pennsylvania.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.770
She's well know for her work
on religion and American life

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.530
and the law of church and state.

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.440
Especially for the ways that
religious liberty developed

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.440
over the course of our history.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.310
She's a frequent
commentator in news media

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.940
on the constitutional law
of religion and debates

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.850
about religious freedom.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.580
Her current book project is
quote, Freedoms Holy Light,

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.760
Disestablishment in America,
1776 to 1876, end quote.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.680
Which is about the
historical relationship

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.860
between religion,
politics and law.

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.750
Her first book, the
Mormon Question, polygamy

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.590
and constitutional conflict
in nineteen century America,

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.440
2002 from the University
of North Carolina Press,

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.130
won the Mormon History
Associations

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.290
in the Utah Historical
Associations best book awards

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.590
in 2003.

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.100
Her second book from Harvard
University Press in 2010,

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.480
The Spirit of the Law, Religious
Voices and the Constitution

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.800
in Modern America, explores
the world of church and state

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.330
in the last, just
the last century.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.370
We will have a question period

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.790
as Dr. Gordon has
concluded her presentation.

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.420
Please joining me
in welcoming her.

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.720
Thank you Sally.

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.250
&gt;&gt; That was such a lovely
introduction, thank you so much.

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:31.580
And I'm so thrilled to be
back here at the Kluge Center,

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.920
where I was in residence
last fall as John said.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:40.970
And I'm particularly glad
to see friends from PAN,

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.630
from other schools
and the district

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.440
and of course from the Center.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:54.200
When I was here I not only
enjoyed exploring this library,

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.320
but also the city itself.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.310
And visiting many of the
locations that I'll be talking

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:07.280
about today, including this
one, the National Cathedral.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.700
My lecture as you have
heard, is about taxes.

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:15.850
And I'll be honest, taxes
can be really boring.

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:20.970
But, this story is
about slavery, religion,

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:27.320
the civil war, the constitution
and of course, money.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.480
Lots of money.

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.900
Just to give one example,

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:38.450
in 2016 tax exempt religious
property in New York City alone,

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:42.020
was valued at 12
billion dollars.

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.060
Traditionally, local
governments assess the value

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.560
of tax exempt property
very conservatively.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.740
So, it's undervalued
significantly.

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.340
But even then, even
at it's low rate,

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.880
it's clear that New York City
lost about a billion dollars

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:04.690
in taxes in 2016 and values have
only sky rocketed since then.

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:07.630
So what I like to say is,
you know, a billion here,

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:13.390
a billion there, pretty soon
you're talking real money.

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:18.390
And what's more, nationwide at
least, nobody knows for certain,

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:22.180
but at least 10% of all
private property belongs

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.310
to religious organizations.

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:30.850
That is as much as the states,
all the states own combined.

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:36.720
And the interest of religious
organizations are evident.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.300
In particular, the
wealthiest churches,

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.200
can you say National Cathedral.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:45.320
Have been the biggest
winners from tax exemption.

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:49.130
And when churches
have been taxed,

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:51.530
the poorest have suffered most.

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:55.140
There doesn't seem to be a
just system available here.

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:57.040
In the 19th century,
for example,

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.500
when there were relatively
robust tax regimes

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:06.230
for religious property, many
tax assessors tended to go

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:08.820
after minority churches.

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:11.220
In California, especially
African American

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:13.480
and Chinese churches suffered.

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:18.360
And in some border states,
especially assessors went

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:21.650
after southern supporting
churches after the Civil War

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:23.400
when republicans were in control

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.920
and they could get away
with punishing them.

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.610
So there's plenty of
finality, honestly,

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:32.460
as well as big questions
as constitutional law

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:34.930
of religious freedom
in local government

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:37.160
that I'm focusing on today.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:41.560
From where I stand, your humble
neighborhood legal historian

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:44.400
of religion, this
is like ground zero.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.370
This is command central
this is what I care about.

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:50.530
And the truth of the
matter is, that religion

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:53.880
and taxes have been at the
center of many disputes

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.510
in our own era as well.

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:59.930
Think about funding for
public and religious schools,

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:02.550
commercial uses of
property owned

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:04.370
by religious organizations.

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:08.320
You know, they have Starbucks
in they, and gyms and so on.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:12.460
And whether churches and other
religious structures can be

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:16.470
excluded by zoning
boards and city planners.

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:19.800
So this history has a
contemporary relevance,

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:24.770
a subject I'll return
to in my conclusion.

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:27.930
But for the lecture
today, I want to focus

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:34.320
on how Americans navigated
politics and religion.

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:38.000
Especially what separation
of church and state,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.520
or what we formally
call disestablishment,

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.740
what that meant.

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:48.810
By the early 1830's, every
jurisdiction had disestablished,

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:52.690
which meant that no
government collected taxes

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:56.120
for religious organizations
any long.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.760
That's about all it meant.

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:03.630
Beyond that, nothing
much was clear.

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:07.560
Which was clear though,
was that the states,

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.150
not the federal government,

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:11.800
were the important
actors in the story.

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:15.770
Congress only got
involved in the 1870's.

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:19.070
And then, only as
the local government

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:21.120
for the District of Columbia.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:26.150
Our story is about local
power and how it was deployed.

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:31.010
And taxes are always important
to those who pay them,

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:34.200
especially if it comes
from where they live.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:41.610
This city, Washington, became
important as an epicenter

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:45.560
of debate over taxation
of religious property

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:49.840
because of the Civil War
and its consequences.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:57.630
Congress imposed taxes on
religious property here in 1874.

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:01.600
In became one of
several places to do so.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:04.450
California did in 1868.

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:11.320
Missouri taxed religious
property between 1865 and 75.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:15.490
My own home state of
Pennsylvania, debated the issue

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:20.430
and decided narrowly against
taxation in the 1870's.

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:24.240
In Massachusetts, a bill hastily
drawn up and hardly debated

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:30.730
at all failed but got more
than a third of all votes cast.

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:32.950
Iowa and Wisconsin
were embroiled

00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:35.570
in debates in the 1870's.

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:38.860
And in New York state, a
special committee appointed

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:42.230
by the Episcopal Diocese
reported on rumblings

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:45.310
about taxation around
the country.

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:48.890
The report complained
that, intemperate men,

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:53.870
by which they meant republicans,
were at the root of the problem

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:55.590
and right-thinking men

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:58.870
of conservative habits
supported exemption.

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:03.820
So clearly this was a
hard-fought topic in the 1870s.

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:06.380
And the truth is,
that it was related

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:09.680
to all the major
issues of the day.

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:14.380
The relationship of church
and state was big news.

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:20.000
In part because the opponents of
slavery had argued for so long

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.100
and so effectively,
that churches were

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:29.620
as much a main stay of the slave
system as governments were.

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:33.720
Many people remember, if
you don't I have it here,

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:37.620
that abolitionist William
Lloyd Garrison burned a copy

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:44.710
of the constitution of July 4th,
1854, to cheers from on lookers.

00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:47.850
He called the document,
a covenant with death,

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:51.300
because the constitution
protected slavery.

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:55.410
Only after the Civil War
was the constitution amended

00:11:55.410 --> 00:12:00.080
in the late 1860's to ban
involuntary servitude,

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:04.080
protect against discriminatory
laws and official treatment

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:07.480
and guarantee the right to vote.

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:11.820
But, religious groups were
just as fiercely attacked

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:14.250
by anti-slavery activists.

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:18.840
Many of them deeply religious
individuals themselves.

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:21.500
And so here I just need
to take a quick detour

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:25.450
to setup the background for
what unfolded in Washington

00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:29.690
after the war ended in 1865.

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:36.230
What happened then was deeply
influenced by events starting

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:44.090
in the late 1830's, when
dedicated abolitionists began

00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:47.180
to argue that American
churches were what they called,

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:50.970
The Bulwarks of American
Slavery.

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:53.850
There you see this, the toga
is particularly attractive

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:56.420
on this guy I think.

00:12:56.420 --> 00:13:00.620
Another said, the only
escape for the slave

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:04.300
from his bondage is over the
ruins of the American church

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.400
and the American state.

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:11.650
In other words, they condemned
both church and state.

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:16.720
And they condemned what they
saw at the union of the two,

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:21.420
the union of church and state,
in a conspiracy to promote

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:24.590
and protect slavery in law.

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:29.750
And to hold congregants to what
they called, spiritual servitude

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:33.560
in church, when the
denominations would not broke

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:37.050
any questions about slavery.

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:39.850
These activists had a point.

00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:44.170
They understood that American
denominations had pioneered the

00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:49.420
theory that silence on slavery
was key to national influence.

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:55.250
Political parties had learned
from the example of churches.

00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:59.790
For some abolitionist who
opposed the growth of slavery

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:02.570
and increased legal
protections for it,

00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:06.550
to push back meant making, you
know, jumping up in the middle

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:08.510
of a pro-slavery
lecture and screaming

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:11.180
about how you --
please don't jump up.

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:13.530
Screaming about how
much you opposed it.

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:18.450
Or interrupting the preacher
in the middle of a sermon

00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:23.090
or holding protests
at party conventions.

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:24.970
But for many of them,

00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:28.420
voting with their feet
meant actually leaving the

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:32.190
institutions that they
thought were so corrupted.

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:35.050
To purify themselves,

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:39.410
abolitionist left
behind organizations

00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:42.970
such as Baptist associations,
that were known

00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:46.900
to do what they called,
exclude the infant sprinkler.

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:49.060
Baptist believe in
adult baptism,

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:51.720
not sprinkling of infants.

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:57.680
Exclude that person and
welcome the infant stealer.

00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:01.730
Welcome the slave
catcher, the slave dealer.

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:05.030
They even accused
southern preachers

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:09.370
of supplying themselves
with sexual partners,

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:12.800
by using slave women
to satisfy their lust.

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.740
I mean, this got
really personal.

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:21.240
Many of those who shared this
deeply religious abhorrence

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:24.660
for slavery, participated
in their own exodus

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:26.940
out of organized religion.

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:29.910
In the book of Revelation
in the New Testament,

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:33.670
a voice from Heaven called
to the Jews of Babylon,

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:35.980
"Come out of her, my people.

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:40.180
That ye be not partakers
of her sins."

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:45.440
Those abolitionists who took
this injunction literally became

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:48.640
known, I kid you
not, as come outers.

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:50.050
They were come outers.

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:52.500
Because they left their churches

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:56.870
and they often abandoned
political parties as well.

00:15:56.870 --> 00:16:00.520
They condemned their former
denominations as sinful

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:04.270
for their hand in glove
relationship with governments.

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:08.100
Major Christian denominations
including Methodist, Baptist,

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:11.640
Presbyterians, Episcopalians,
and Catholics,

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:16.840
officially remained neutral
on slavery because they argued

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:20.050
that enslaved status
was as civil,

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:22.800
rather than a religious
question.

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:24.460
Even the Congregationalists,

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:26.930
my own New England
Congregationalists,

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:31.060
could not be trusted to
hold a strong stance.

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:35.230
As their shabby treatment of
this very distinguished person,

00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:38.880
Alexander Crummell at
Yale, in 1840 demonstrated.

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:41.720
He founded St. Luke's
Church here,

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:43.570
which some of you may know.

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:46.310
And I had fun going to that too.

00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:51.760
And after 1830's, even the
Quakers abandoned direct

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:55.330
engagement on slavery.

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:59.840
In the process, these
church bodies abdicated any

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:04.300
responsibility for the
peculiar institution.

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:09.230
In the eyes of abolitionist,
they washed their hands just

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:15.010
as Pontius Pilate had, turning
their backs on sin and violence.

00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:18.030
And in their turn,
added the abolitionist,

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:22.570
political institutions and
judges worked assiduously

00:17:22.570 --> 00:17:26.320
to protect slavery through
inhumane laws and claim

00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:29.750
that their hands were tied
by the national constitution.

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:32.860
This was the union of church
and state that produced

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:35.880
such outrage and
shielded sinners.

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:37.930
In this perspective,

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:41.360
disestablishment
was a cruel joke.

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:46.840
An excuse for violating the most
basic principles of justice.

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:49.910
Those who came out of
their houses of worship,

00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:52.740
therefore were critical
of government

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:56.130
and organized religion.

00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:59.750
There were a lot of come outers.

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:02.500
It's difficult to recover
numbers for a movement

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:08.190
that was local and ephemeral
and anti-authoritarian.

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:13.540
But the best estimates are
that about 250,000 people

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:17.740
across the upper north and
Midwest, left their churches,

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:21.970
because they would not
compromise with slavery.

00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:26.180
And they extended the
radical religious critique

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:28.680
to other forms of coercion too.

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:35.190
In their eyes, enslavement could
and did come in many forms.

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:39.270
To some, membership in
churches that failed to speak

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:42.240
out against, man
stealing, as they called it,

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:46.560
was itself a form
involuntary servitude.

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:50.610
The great anti-slavery
activist, Frederick Douglas,

00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:52.910
a come outer I should say.

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:55.190
Explained that he
remained a fugitive,

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:58.040
even after escaping
from the south.

00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:03.690
Because American religious
institutions condemned him

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:08.780
and their own members,
to continued bondage.

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:11.650
Spiritual bondage.

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:19.750
He -- Douglas said, he had
been given authorization

00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:25.150
to understand what sin was
by Jesus and his message.

00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:29.310
Something that clearly these
denominations had not been

00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:31.860
engaged with.

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:36.070
Another observer, the acid
tongued English woman,

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:37.420
Frances Trollope, I don't know

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:40.360
if anyone's ever read
her, she's so much fun.

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:45.680
Wrote of her four years in
Cincinnati in the early 1840s'.

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:47.300
She said that she had learned

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:51.150
that religious tyranny
survived disestablishment

00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:56.110
and had become much more
oppressive than the paying

00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:58.900
of a religious tax
has ever been.

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:00.700
"Church and state", she said,

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:03.750
"hobble along side by side,

00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:08.580
notwithstanding their
boasted independence."

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:13.340
These activates that I'm
talking about this afternoon,

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:17.510
worked to eradicate that
Ecclesiastical tyranny

00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:20.650
and other form of servitude.

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:25.140
Eventually even including,
the authority exercised

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:27.570
by husbands over wives.

00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:31.220
A cause that Frederick
Douglas embraced

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:37.350
at the first Women's Rights
Convention Seneca Falls in 1848.

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:41.410
And it made sense, that the
first Women's Rights meetings

00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:47.380
were held in a small church in a
small town, in upstate New York.

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:50.570
Because that's where
the action was.

00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:56.410
Think of it like, upstate New
York was then what California

00:20:56.410 --> 00:20:57.710
is now.

00:20:57.710 --> 00:21:00.060
It was the place
where experimentation

00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:04.410
and exciting ideas came to life.

00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:11.510
The people who came out of
churches in the late 1830's

00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:17.210
and early 1840's, had also
witnessed a great recession,

00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:19.800
which cemented what
they attacked

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:22.770
as the true union
of church and state.

00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:27.470
So now I'm going to shift back
to taxes and the issues raises

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:30.480
by tax exemptions for
religious property.

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:37.570
In 1837, a major financial
crisis revealed the shaky nature

00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:41.460
of many financial institutions
in the United States.

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:46.900
Bad loans, failure to
investigate expensive

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:52.200
and ridiculous projects,
careless state governments

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:54.320
and so on, were the center piece

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:58.470
of widespread bankruptcies
and bank failures.

00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:00.170
Kind of sound familiar?

00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:01.830
Right? [laughs] Did
some of us live

00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:04.240
through something
like this recently?

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:08.620
The president at the time,
Martin Van Buren a democrat,

00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:13.910
was so opposed to any relief
for state and local governments,

00:22:13.910 --> 00:22:17.660
that he counseled those left
penniless from the recession not

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:20.080
to look to the national
government for help, right?

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:22.080
Presidents have learned
since then.

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:26.370
He earned the nickname, Martin
Van Ruin, and lost his bid

00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:29.310
for re-election in 1840.

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:32.080
But state governments changed.

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:34.640
They changed drastically,

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:38.800
especially across the
north and Midwest.

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:42.860
For the first time, they
established more regular regimes

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:47.640
of taxation, leaving property
taxes to be collected and used

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:49.140
by local governments

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:52.210
and reserving income
taxes for themselves.

00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:56.810
This rough divide
still describes much

00:22:56.810 --> 00:22:59.580
of our state system of taxation.

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:01.300
But there's a problem here.

00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:03.220
And I want to explore it.

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:09.480
The states set the policy for
property as well as income taxes

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:12.530
but left the assessment
and collection and most

00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:16.750
of the spending of property tax
revenue to local governments.

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:22.880
Anyone here think that
their taxes are too high

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:26.330
because local spending on
schools is out of control?

00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:27.930
Right? That's a familiar.

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:30.640
Or maybe, they come
from the other side

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:35.100
of the spectrum saying
that, those people who gripe

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:37.250
about taxes should stop whining

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:41.510
because education is the most
important local responsibility.

00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:46.600
Well, property taxes as the
mainstay for local governments,

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:50.840
has been in place
for about 180 years.

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:53.550
But the problem that
I mentioned just now,

00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:56.280
is that state legislatures
have control

00:23:56.280 --> 00:24:00.120
over what property is taxed,

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:03.620
even though local governments
are in charge of just

00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:07.210
about everything else
associated with property taxes.

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:11.470
And this sets up a
perverse relationship.

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:15.710
Put roughly, state governments
don't lose any funding

00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:18.020
when they exempt a given class

00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:21.650
of tax payer from
property taxes.

00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:26.520
So for example, a
retirement community called,

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:28.890
Holy Cross Village,
was constructed

00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:32.650
by the Catholic church
in South Bend Indiana.

00:24:32.650 --> 00:24:38.810
And, my favorite, theme
park, Holy Land Experience,

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:43.330
was built by a Baptist
minister in Orlando, Florida.

00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:46.670
Both were denied
claimed tax exemptions

00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:49.980
by their local county
tax assessors

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:53.180
and both tax assessors
were overruled

00:24:53.180 --> 00:25:00.940
as the state legislature granted
exemptions at the state level.

00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:04.590
Often, local tax
collectors argue

00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:08.520
that these are profitable
businesses.

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:16.330
But, state legislatures are
always much more accommodating.

00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:21.020
The role of states versus
local government in granting

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:24.230
such exemptions, has
been the key problem

00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:26.190
from the very beginning.

00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:28.670
Massachusetts was
the first state

00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:33.070
to exempt religious property
in response to the new system

00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:35.590
of taxation in the late 1830's.

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:38.830
This is literally the
first tax exemption

00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:42.600
for religious property
in American history.

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:45.510
This is notable,
it did not start

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:48.310
with the revolution
or the constitution.

00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:53.720
Then New Hampshire, New York,
Iowa, Maryland, Connecticut

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:57.790
and Wisconsin followed
all before 1845.

00:25:57.790 --> 00:25:59.360
By own home state

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:04.570
of Pennsylvania amended
its constitution in 1838,

00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:07.550
providing for exemptions
for the first time.

00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:09.580
I've read the constitutional
debates

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:12.480
and the controversy was hot.

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:16.540
Eventually, the amendment
passed but some delegates

00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:21.440
who opposed the exemptions said
that they were so exhausted

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:24.930
by the fights over the issue,
that they finally voted for it

00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:28.100
so that the entire
convention would not fail.

00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:30.060
In other words, a
constitutional convention was

00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:32.680
about to fail over this.

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:37.200
Everyone was assured that
the exemption only extended

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:40.300
to buildings used
exclusively for worship.

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:44.170
And they promised never
to exempt parsonages,

00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:46.950
giving in on this one
benefit they said,

00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:49.300
would not be the
prequel for others.

00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:51.170
And ahem, I'm sorry to report

00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:55.100
that Pennsylvania exempted
parsonages in 1873.

00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:59.530
[laughs] One study
in the 1850's brought

00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:03.290
by the Philadelphia county
tax assessors, argued based

00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:07.900
on a review of all property in
the county, that the exemption

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:10.110
for religious property
raised taxes

00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:13.800
for other residence
by at least 10%.

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:16.310
And if religious property
were fairly assessed

00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:18.900
so that the privilege
was accurately valued,

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:22.470
the number would
be closer to 20%.

00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:25.760
And this is where our
abolitionist come in.

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:28.820
They opposed tax exemptions.

00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:33.260
They opposed anything that
would treat religion specially,

00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:38.600
all should live according to
the same rules, they argued.

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:43.020
Add to this, and this is where
it gets really complicated,

00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:46.150
the fact that the
same legislatures

00:27:46.150 --> 00:27:51.320
that protected religious
property also protected slave

00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:57.110
holders from taxation,
at exactly the same time.

00:27:57.110 --> 00:28:02.760
In other words, legislatures
delivered special tax status

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:07.360
to slave holders and
religious institutions just

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:12.270
as the religious critique
of them both gathered steam.

00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:17.190
More powerful and wide ranging
state governments were drawn

00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:20.560
ever more tightly into
the defense of slavery

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:24.580
and of privileges for
religious institutions.

00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:27.010
In light of this pattern,

00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:30.490
abolitionists had some
good reason to complain

00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:34.430
about the relationship between
religious denominations,

00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:37.350
state governments and slavery.

00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:41.000
The strings connecting them
had only gotten stronger

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.990
in the late 1830's
and early 1840's.

00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:50.980
Our dissenters however, argued
for much more diffuse government

00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:54.740
and much more diffuse
religious life.

00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:58.430
They believed in true localism.

00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:02.950
The village level, they said,
was the only reliable place

00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:07.010
where freedom and
democracy could be protected.

00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:12.770
In state capitals by contrast,
priests and tyrant's lived cheek

00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:15.010
by jowl, they use this kind
of language all the time.

00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:16.860
It's so much fun.

00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:20.270
Each feeding the other and
trading away the rights

00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:25.920
of persons to serve their own
lust for power and wealth.

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:29.840
Institutional bodies,
like church corporations,

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:32.690
state legislatures,
were recognized

00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:35.720
as legal persons to be sure.

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:40.110
But they were not human
beings, said abolitionists.

00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:45.980
They exercised power, not on the
basis of individual conscience,

00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:53.860
but on the search for
a political identity

00:29:53.860 --> 00:30:00.280
and religious authority, as
opposed to the individual who

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:06.620
whose conscience and
access to understanding

00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:10.760
of what human rights truly
mean, was uninterrupted

00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:13.710
by this corporate identity.

00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:17.990
So any elected or anointed
men of power, they said,

00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:20.370
were prone to tyranny.

00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:23.650
Slavery was the most
aggression oppression,

00:30:23.650 --> 00:30:27.290
but others traveled alongside.

00:30:27.290 --> 00:30:32.060
And in truth, it was a lot
harder to do away with slavery

00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:34.820
than northern officials
had expected.

00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:37.840
The violence, and this is where
I get to Drew Faust, John.

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:43.570
The violence and length of the
Civil War that started in 1861,

00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:48.490
exceeded anything seen
in prior human history.

00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:53.590
And during the war, minister
sermons on both sides,

00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:57.880
stoked the bloodlust, turning
the war into a religious event

00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:00.840
of apocalyptic proportions.

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:04.810
Historians of religions have
shown how crucial this religious

00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:08.890
interpretation was to the
willingness to persevere

00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:12.200
in the face of unheard
of death and suffering.

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:14.900
Historians of the war itself,

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:19.450
have begun to piece together
how the dead were dealt with.

00:31:19.450 --> 00:31:20.750
[laughs] This is a gloomy topic.

00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:25.030
How the dead were dealt
with, not children laughing.

00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:31.140
The great explosion of
[laughs] of death in war,

00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:35.360
meant that everyone was
affected by the carnage.

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:37.630
And Drew Faust for example,

00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:42.070
has written that we have no
accurate account of deaths

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:45.880
to rely on, even of soldiers.

00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:51.000
By an enormous margin this was
the bloodiest war Americans have

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.630
ever endured.

00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:57.060
Faust and others have begun to
explore the industries of death

00:31:57.060 --> 00:32:00.250
and medical treatment
that emerged in the war.

00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:03.410
But nobody has really
explored the ways

00:32:03.410 --> 00:32:07.510
that that war increased
religious authority,

00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:10.510
influence and wealth.

00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:14.020
Here is where the city of
Washington provides insight

00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:16.470
into the institutional aspects

00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:19.480
of religious life
after the Civil War.

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:24.550
And helps put into context
the debate over tax exemption.

00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:28.850
Because the relationship
between religion and government

00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:34.060
that had been the target
of radical abolitionists,

00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:39.460
that relationship had only
deepened across the war.

00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:43.900
The numbers tell the story
and president Ulysses Grant,

00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:47.150
was horrified by what he saw.

00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:49.550
He was a veteran
of the war and one

00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:51.930
of Lincoln's most
trusted generals.

00:32:51.930 --> 00:32:54.710
A man who oversaw
many battles and many,

00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:57.520
many thousands of deaths.

00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:02.840
But he did not expect to learn
how much wealth was shifted

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:05.050
to religious control.

00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:09.330
His final state of
the union message

00:33:09.330 --> 00:33:13.190
to congress dealt
extensively with this issue.

00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:17.850
In the lead up to the
Civil War, 1850 to 1860,

00:33:17.850 --> 00:33:19.550
church property doubled.

00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:21.940
Valued at about 83
million dollars

00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:25.790
to about 165 million dollars.

00:33:25.790 --> 00:33:30.490
Just between 1860 and 1874.

00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:37.250
So after the first doubling,
it grew five times over,

00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:40.070
to about a billion dollars.

00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:45.860
What's more, the economy was
mired in another deep recession

00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:50.370
when Grant spoke, which
began in the early 1870's

00:33:50.370 --> 00:33:55.940
and did not truly lift until the
early -- until the late 1890's.

00:33:55.940 --> 00:34:03.530
But, church building was a
phenomenal growth industry.

00:34:03.530 --> 00:34:05.480
New stone churches,

00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:08.510
commemorative stained-glass
windows and plaques,

00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:13.250
enormous steeples and many
naves and crypts dedicated

00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:18.060
to fallen soldiers
appeared everywhere.

00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:23.390
This boom featured church
architecture that favored ornate

00:34:23.390 --> 00:34:27.740
and imposing buildings
in desirable locations.

00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:30.480
Even for say, like
Baptist or Methodist,

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:34.750
who traditionally had
built very modest churches.

00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:37.700
And in turn, these
new buildings catered

00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:40.660
to far more well-heeled
congregants,

00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:43.950
who gathered much
more often in cities

00:34:43.950 --> 00:34:48.920
than in those villages we talked
about in upstate New York.

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:53.010
In the process, many
churches drifted away

00:34:53.010 --> 00:34:56.730
from plausible identification
as charities.

00:34:56.730 --> 00:35:02.460
The respectability exposed them
to critiques of another sort.

00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:05.380
They had become, established.

00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:09.180
With all the vaguely threatening
implications of at term

00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:12.850
in American religious
life and law.

00:35:12.850 --> 00:35:17.500
Historians speak of a
moral establishment,

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:20.000
or a second establishment,

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.990
that characterized post-Civil
War American culture.

00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:30.310
What I want to stress, is an
aspect that nobody has studied.

00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:34.500
This establishment, if that's
the right term, was grounded

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:38.930
in material fact, built
on wealth that reflected

00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:43.380
and in turn nurtured
political power.

00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:46.140
Grants claims about the
value of church property

00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:51.110
and it's relation to tax
exemption hit raw nerves.

00:35:51.110 --> 00:35:55.060
Ostentation had long been
a favorite theme of those

00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:57.010
who posed tax exemptions.

00:35:57.010 --> 00:35:59.690
They didn't like
gold plated domes,

00:35:59.690 --> 00:36:07.060
or ornate silver alter services,
or flying buttress and so on.

00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:12.270
These struck many observers
a entirely inappropriate

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:14.420
to the American landscape.

00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:15.720
Yet the construction

00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:20.000
of magnificent churches
continued apace.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:25.140
Especially, but not only, by
Presbyterians, Episcopalians,

00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:31.620
and Roman Catholics and
they're wealthier congregations.

00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:36.270
Equally important, an editorial
in the new magazine, The Nation,

00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:38.520
now a very old magazine, charged

00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:42.080
that these ornate piles
were more like social clubs

00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:44.350
than sober houses of God.

00:36:44.350 --> 00:36:47.790
The benefits of these
palaces, the argument went,

00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:53.010
flowed to those who were
already well clothed and shod

00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:56.200
and attended churches
according to their prosperity,

00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:57.880
while ignoring the poor

00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:01.340
that should have been
their primary concern.

00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:03.590
In Manhattan in particular,

00:37:03.590 --> 00:37:07.100
a charge like this had
a real basis in reality.

00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:10.340
Between the end of the
Civil War and the turn

00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:14.260
of the 20th century,
lower Manhattan mushroomed

00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:17.240
in population and poverty.

00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:21.700
But churches, even Catholic
ones, moved up town.

00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:25.250
See St. Patrick's
Cathedral here on the screen.

00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:32.230
A massive, decorated, neogothic
structure, which opened in 1878,

00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:35.800
much to the outrage of
opponents of exemption.

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:39.170
And the preacher,
Henry Ward Beecher,

00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:42.970
rector of the Plymouth Church
in Brooklyn, was criticized

00:37:42.970 --> 00:37:45.730
for the fact that he didn't
notice people striving

00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:47.030
around him.

00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:50.300
He condemned striking railroad
workers, telling them to go

00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:54.030
down bravely into poverty.

00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:58.210
And last but not least, banging
on New York, Trinity Church

00:37:58.210 --> 00:38:01.930
of Wallstreet, they didn't move,
but they attracted worshipers

00:38:01.930 --> 00:38:05.240
by investing heavily in talent.

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:09.280
They had a beautiful organ, a
highly accomplished organist,

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:13.420
a choir of well trained
men and boys, to sing.

00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:17.180
An orchestra of string
and wind instruments.

00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:19.720
A beautiful chime of bells.

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:23.720
And several clergymen
trained to chant the service

00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:26.680
in harmony with the music.

00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:29.510
The rector of Trinity, I
can't believe he said this,

00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:34.020
he acknowledged his success in
attracting congregants as quote,

00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:40.340
"The blessing of God
upon good music".

00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:42.790
[laughs] Honestly, honestly.

00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:47.210
Even Andrew Carnegie
argued in a piece he titled,

00:38:47.210 --> 00:38:50.950
The Gospel of Wealth,
that the true cure

00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:53.990
for inequality was
redistribution

00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:56.820
through philanthropy
by industrial

00:38:56.820 --> 00:39:06.180
and financial tycoons just like
him, not so much by churches.

00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:10.290
But instead by these
great industrialists.

00:39:10.290 --> 00:39:17.530
And as that long recession that
I just spoke about, unfolded

00:39:17.530 --> 00:39:29.570
and began to really take bite,
opponents of exemption, reunited

00:39:29.570 --> 00:39:34.420
and called on their
anti-slavery roots

00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:38.760
to once again, attack
denominations.

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:41.790
The Liberty League was headed
by this guy you see there,

00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:48.100
Francis Ellingwood Abbot, who
founded a magazine called,

00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:53.490
The Index, in 1870 to promote
liberal religious causes.

00:39:53.490 --> 00:39:57.980
First among them, the
revocation of tax exemptions.

00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:02.170
In 1872, he published
a nine point platform

00:40:02.170 --> 00:40:04.300
and I'll only read
you the first one.

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:07.000
Demand number one, churches

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.280
and other Ecclesiastical
property shall no longer be

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:14.100
exempt from taxation.

00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:19.850
They wanted to ban every kind
of privilege for religion

00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:22.920
and a religious freedom
amendment to the constitution,

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:27.780
including what they called
indirect taxation, in any state

00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:32.170
for support of any
sect or religious body.

00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:38.610
And one thing I should say, is
that remember that photograph

00:40:38.610 --> 00:40:40.510
of Elizabeth Cady Stanton?

00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:45.470
She added her voice to the
mix, by now a much older woman,

00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:50.110
saying that gender should
be added to the list

00:40:50.110 --> 00:40:52.850
of injustices worked
by tax exemption

00:40:52.850 --> 00:40:55.490
for religious property.

00:40:55.490 --> 00:40:58.880
Every poor widow, she
said, who struggled to feed

00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:00.520
and cloth her children,

00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:04.820
was taxed on the narrow
lot and humble home.

00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:06.800
While the magnificent cathedrals

00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:09.400
with their valuable
lands in Boston.

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:14.220
Philadelphia and New
York, pay not a cent.

00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:17.750
So one thing to recognize here,

00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:21.620
is that these were not
anti-Christian arguments.

00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:26.930
They we are deeply based
religious arguments.

00:41:26.930 --> 00:41:33.340
And they resonated not only
with Elizabeth Cady Stanton

00:41:33.340 --> 00:41:36.730
and Frederick Douglas,
but after the Civil War,

00:41:36.730 --> 00:41:40.020
rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise
and many reformed Jews,

00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:42.180
also supported the
liberal league.

00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:45.470
As did liberal wings
of either some

00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:50.340
of those hated denominations,
including Baptist, Quakers,

00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:53.800
many Unitarians and
some Episcopalians.

00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:59.650
In the 1870's the campaign
brought the Washington

00:41:59.650 --> 00:42:05.080
to revoke tax exemptions, was
actually well received here.

00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:09.380
Especially, because
the economy had tanked

00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:16.220
and because Abbot showed up and
gave to senator Charles Sumner,

00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:23.350
a thousand foot long petition
with 35,000 signatures on it.

00:42:23.350 --> 00:42:27.700
Congress responded in 1874

00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:30.040
when it directed
Washington city officials

00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:32.600
to tax religious property.

00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:35.010
Under the new law,
the commissioners

00:42:35.010 --> 00:42:37.770
of the district created
an assessment board,

00:42:37.770 --> 00:42:40.680
which assessed taxes
on church property,

00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:44.590
totaling 46,500 dollars.

00:42:44.590 --> 00:42:48.650
All but three of the district
churches refused to pay it.

00:42:48.650 --> 00:42:52.420
In response, the district
foreclosed on all but three

00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:54.570
of the churches in the district.

00:42:54.570 --> 00:42:56.460
By uncomfortable moment.

00:42:56.460 --> 00:43:01.810
At an impasse of potentially
disastrous proportions,

00:43:01.810 --> 00:43:06.690
the churches collectively
appointed a two-men committee

00:43:06.690 --> 00:43:11.750
chaired by the reverend A.W.
Pitzer, a Presbyterian minister

00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:13.510
and lobbyist and as
far as I can tell,

00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:18.120
the poor second person never
said a word back Pitzer talked

00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:19.460
all the time.

00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:24.240
He was to review the situation
and present the subject

00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:27.180
to congress and procure
if possible,

00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:29.360
a bill to relieve the churches

00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:32.990
from what he called
this illegal tax.

00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:37.500
Even then, Pitzer met with
determined opposition,

00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:39.140
especially from the chairman

00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:40.820
from the senate judiciary
committee,

00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:42.850
always a powerful individual.

00:43:42.850 --> 00:43:45.990
This was republican
George Edmunds of Vermont,

00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:48.810
a strong proponent
of publication.

00:43:48.810 --> 00:43:51.090
Excuse me, of public education.

00:43:51.090 --> 00:43:53.870
He pointed out that the
district schools were

00:43:53.870 --> 00:43:56.950
about to be closed
for want of funds.

00:43:56.950 --> 00:44:00.930
And that the approximately
50,000 dollars long overdue

00:44:00.930 --> 00:44:03.060
in tax payments by the churches,

00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:06.100
would just about keep
the churches going

00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:08.490
and fulfill the duty
of Christians

00:44:08.490 --> 00:44:11.060
to instruct the young.

00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:13.820
Pitzer fought back,
claiming that churches were

00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:18.630
by their very organization,
charitable and educational.

00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:22.620
And the reporter, you can hear
the report laughing [laughs]

00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:24.330
when he says that.

00:44:24.330 --> 00:44:26.380
He says that he said
it apparently

00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:29.470
without any self reflection.

00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:34.130
But, Pitzer wisely conceded that
some groups may have indulged

00:44:34.130 --> 00:44:39.220
in a degree of ostentation that
was unbecoming in a city full

00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:43.080
of impoverished children
and powerful politicians.

00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:47.430
The churches now agreed that
only buildings used actively

00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:49.490
for worship would be exempt

00:44:49.490 --> 00:44:53.430
and that any new buildings
would be more modest.

00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:57.420
And any income from
rental and any other form

00:44:57.420 --> 00:45:00.650
of religious property,
can you say parsonages?

00:45:00.650 --> 00:45:03.020
Would remain taxable.

00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:06.850
Evidently relieved, both
houses passed legislation

00:45:06.850 --> 00:45:09.720
to that effect unanimously
and without debate.

00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:13.300
That was a disappointing moment
in the archive, no debate.

00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:17.460
And also returned the
2,500 pitons [phonetic]

00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:20.090
that had been collected.

00:45:20.090 --> 00:45:25.780
So in 1879, congress officially
abandoned it's experiment

00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:27.670
in taxation.

00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:32.210
And the reverend Pitzer, noted
with satisfaction in an article

00:45:32.210 --> 00:45:38.060
on the topic, that the political
situation had become untenable

00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:39.360
for them.

00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:42.640
And it is true, especially
with reconstruction collapsing.

00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:46.180
A pace, republicans
were in retreat.

00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:49.540
And Pitzer changed to
suit the circumstances.

00:45:49.540 --> 00:45:53.380
As I mentioned he promised

00:45:53.380 --> 00:46:00.170
that he would reduce the
ornateness of churches.

00:46:00.170 --> 00:46:05.680
And I am sorry to say, he
spoke with forked tongue.

00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:10.600
Congress granted a
charter, where are we?

00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:15.340
There we are, in 1893,

00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:18.330
to the Protestant Episcopal
Cathedral Foundation

00:46:18.330 --> 00:46:21.140
for the erection of
National Cathedral,

00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:25.230
the sixth largest
church in the world.

00:46:25.230 --> 00:46:28.960
The project was enthusiastically
supported by our friend,

00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:32.060
the reverend Pitzer,
despite his earlier promises

00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:34.240
to d nothing of the kind.

00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:38.850
So, as I wind up,
let me just ask,

00:46:38.850 --> 00:46:41.840
"What should we think
about this history?"

00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:44.360
What lessons should we take?

00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:47.230
First, nobody knows this stuff.

00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:48.530
It's amazing.

00:46:48.530 --> 00:46:50.230
It's just been papered over.

00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:55.350
Most Americans and many
experts in the law of religion,

00:46:55.350 --> 00:46:58.860
believe that exemptions
have always been granted.

00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:03.410
And honestly, the supreme court
has been part of the problem.

00:47:03.410 --> 00:47:06.570
In the late 1860's,
a sustained campaign

00:47:06.570 --> 00:47:11.390
by New York based religious
groups made a strong attack

00:47:11.390 --> 00:47:15.060
on the widespread
exemptions available there.

00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:19.470
In the 1970 case, Walz
against Tax Commission,

00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:23.760
the plaintiff argued that
his taxes were higher

00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:25.260
because even though he was a man

00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:28.870
who had no religious
affiliation, he had to support

00:47:28.870 --> 00:47:30.210
by paying higher taxes,

00:47:30.210 --> 00:47:33.100
New York's tax-exempt
religious property.

00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:37.070
This, in other words, was a tax
imposed to support religion.

00:47:37.070 --> 00:47:42.920
The United States Supreme
Court upheld the exemption,

00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:45.980
on the basis of a
historical argument.

00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:50.790
Chief Justice Warren Burger,
emphasized that two centuries

00:47:50.790 --> 00:47:53.190
of uninterrupted
freedom taxation,

00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:55.330
I mean right next door, right?

00:47:55.330 --> 00:47:56.870
They got it wrong.

00:47:56.870 --> 00:48:02.320
Had not produced the remotest
sign of favoritism to religion,

00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:06.750
but rather protected all
forms of religious belief.

00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:09.190
This history, he said,
supported the idea

00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:12.980
that tax exemptions
were entirely consistent

00:48:12.980 --> 00:48:14.560
with disestablishment.

00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:17.590
And of course, all of
us in this room know

00:48:17.590 --> 00:48:20.350
that just isn't the case,

00:48:20.350 --> 00:48:22.390
that there have been
sustained critiques

00:48:22.390 --> 00:48:26.670
and important exceptions
to tax exemption.

00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:32.450
And that, just there,
they taxed churches.

00:48:32.450 --> 00:48:34.960
So that's one lesson,
with should wake up

00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:39.330
and smell the humus and start
doing some historical research.

00:48:39.330 --> 00:48:47.450
Second, it is always the case
in each of these episodes,

00:48:47.450 --> 00:48:52.900
that economic down turns produce
impatience with exemptions.

00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:57.920
And increase into the wealthier
of religious institutions.

00:48:57.920 --> 00:49:03.610
And our almost great recession,
produced several such inquiries.

00:49:03.610 --> 00:49:07.090
The state of Colorado
conducted an investigation

00:49:07.090 --> 00:49:10.940
into the exponential growth
in tax exempt property there.

00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:15.440
And found that exemptions had
grown increasingly generous

00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:19.010
over the past generation,

00:49:19.010 --> 00:49:23.410
and often in way
unbeknown to legislatures.

00:49:23.410 --> 00:49:28.330
In 2008, calls to revoke
tax exemption spread

00:49:28.330 --> 00:49:31.690
as the financial crisis
deepened and the most --

00:49:31.690 --> 00:49:36.950
and they lasted pretty
steadily through about 2015,

00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:39.720
so until quite recently.

00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:42.650
Finally, and I want to
return to that point

00:49:42.650 --> 00:49:47.530
that there's big money at
stake and a great history full

00:49:47.530 --> 00:49:49.730
of politics and broken promises

00:49:49.730 --> 00:49:52.360
and racial prejudice
and oppression.

00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:58.320
And to point out, the Supreme
Court upheld tax exemptions

00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:02.250
in Walz, against
a challenge based

00:50:02.250 --> 00:50:03.550
on the establishment clause.

00:50:03.550 --> 00:50:06.570
But it has never held

00:50:06.570 --> 00:50:11.140
that religious freedom
requires exemption.

00:50:11.140 --> 00:50:13.620
So there's still
plenty to feet about.

00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:16.740
And I hate to predict the
future, because I'm much better

00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:18.240
at predicting the past.

00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:20.750
But this will come
up, I promise you.

00:50:20.750 --> 00:50:23.060
The next big recession
this will come up.

00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:26.130
So I just want to
say, stay tuned.

00:50:26.130 --> 00:50:27.430
Thank you.

00:50:27.430 --> 00:50:29.230
&gt;&gt; Thank you Sarah.

[ Applause ]

00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:34.920
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: And we
have a couple minutes

00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:38.000
to take a few questions, and we
might just take a few rat a tat

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:41.590
and see what Sally has to say
about them, because we have,

00:50:41.590 --> 00:50:44.090
I hope you all will stay
and enjoy the reception

00:50:44.090 --> 00:50:48.130
that the Maguire Endowment
is paying for today

00:50:48.130 --> 00:50:49.730
and that is for all of you.

00:50:49.730 --> 00:50:55.440
And so, raise your hand if
you have a question for Sally.

00:50:55.440 --> 00:50:58.990
Do not be shy.

00:50:58.990 --> 00:51:00.410
Andrew, right here.

00:51:00.410 --> 00:51:01.710
&gt;&gt; Hello.

00:51:01.710 --> 00:51:03.010
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: So we'll have
these two gentlemen right here,

00:51:03.010 --> 00:51:05.400
just a quick question and
then we'll hand the microphone

00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:06.700
over to the gentleman
next to you

00:51:06.700 --> 00:51:08.530
and then we'll see
what Sally has to say.

00:51:08.530 --> 00:51:11.290
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much for
a most interesting talk.

00:51:11.290 --> 00:51:13.320
Given that you mentioned there
is some movement in the states,

00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:15.820
particularly in the
western period also,

00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:18.260
and there is interest in the
federal government in toying

00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:21.670
with Washington D.C. as they
frequently do, were there any

00:51:21.670 --> 00:51:25.620
in congress in the 1870's who
were interested in pursuing some

00:51:25.620 --> 00:51:29.430
of these exemptions
policies in the territories?

00:51:29.430 --> 00:51:30.730
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sarah Barringer
Gordon: That's a great.

00:51:30.730 --> 00:51:34.390
&gt;&gt; John Haskell:
Okay, hold onto that,

00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:37.890
we're going to let this
guy ask the questions.

00:51:37.890 --> 00:51:39.190
And then, you can
handle them both.

00:51:39.190 --> 00:51:40.490
Whether they link or not.

00:51:40.490 --> 00:51:41.790
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sarah Barringer
Gordon: Yeah.

00:51:41.790 --> 00:51:43.090
&gt;&gt; So you annihilated the idea
that this was always out there.

00:51:43.090 --> 00:51:44.790
But you know, under the
idea that, you know,

00:51:44.790 --> 00:51:48.640
sometimes taxes are done to
discourage things, I'm thinking

00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:53.330
for example syntax's, I
always thought it was sort of,

00:51:53.330 --> 00:51:55.330
you know, a difficult
topic to think

00:51:55.330 --> 00:51:58.390
of taxing religious institutions
because you didn't want

00:51:58.390 --> 00:52:01.820
to discourage religion, even
though there is a separation.

00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:04.390
And then what about other
western governments,

00:52:04.390 --> 00:52:06.510
other western countries.

00:52:06.510 --> 00:52:08.180
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sarah Barringer
Gordon: Mmm-hmm.

00:52:08.180 --> 00:52:09.480
Should I answer now?

00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:10.780
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Yeah.

00:52:10.780 --> 00:52:12.960
I haven't got anybody
else indicating.

00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:14.260
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sarah Barringer
Gordon: Okay, good.

00:52:14.260 --> 00:52:15.620
So the question about
the territories is

00:52:15.620 --> 00:52:17.590
really interesting.

00:52:17.590 --> 00:52:26.600
There was, congress officially
disapproved in the late 1850's,

00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:28.810
the incorporation of the
Church of Jesus Christ

00:52:28.810 --> 00:52:31.780
of Latter Day Saints, because
it had no limits on the amount

00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:34.210
of property it could hold.

00:52:34.210 --> 00:52:39.260
So one of the things that
you can see happening,

00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:45.680
is that there was this
commitment through the onset

00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:49.930
of the Civil War, to keeping
religious property pretty

00:52:49.930 --> 00:52:51.240
tightly contained.

00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:53.090
In other words, not
allowing them

00:52:53.090 --> 00:52:55.620
to become extraordinarily
wealthy.

00:52:55.620 --> 00:52:58.950
That is gone, by 1875.

00:52:58.950 --> 00:53:01.940
So what's interesting
is to see that.

00:53:01.940 --> 00:53:05.830
In terms of other
western states,

00:53:05.830 --> 00:53:10.540
California is really interesting
because it's constitution

00:53:10.540 --> 00:53:14.570
of 1850 promised equal
taxation for everybody,

00:53:14.570 --> 00:53:18.790
which was a standard,
protect slavery clause,

00:53:18.790 --> 00:53:23.140
that was included in many
southern state constitutions.

00:53:23.140 --> 00:53:26.140
In other words, you
couldn't tax slavery higher

00:53:26.140 --> 00:53:27.440
than you taxed anything else.

00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:30.040
&gt;&gt; I was thinking about
other countries, though.

00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:33.300
Other country, European
countries.

00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:35.380
Other countries with
democracies.

00:53:35.380 --> 00:53:37.660
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sarah Barringer
Gordon: Okay.

00:53:37.660 --> 00:53:40.360
So, in the U/.K. for example,

00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:43.910
which has an established
religion, even churches have

00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:48.690
to prove that they're charitable
to receive government.

00:53:48.690 --> 00:53:52.140
Even the church of England
has to prove every year

00:53:52.140 --> 00:53:55.610
that it engages in
significant charitable activity.

00:53:55.610 --> 00:53:58.480
You don't just get it
because you're religious.

00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:01.260
&gt;&gt; Germany, France,
that kind of place?

00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:05.760
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sarah Barringer Gordon:
As far as I know, Germany,

00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:10.150
you can -- there's a box
you can check on your taxes

00:54:10.150 --> 00:54:13.640
that will allow a certain
proportion of them to go

00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:15.280
to religious organizations.

00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:19.520
And I think you can specify
a little bit, you know,

00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:22.480
you can't just say, "Send it
to the Jehovah's Witnesses

00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:26.900
down the street and definitely
not those creeps across the way,

00:54:26.900 --> 00:54:28.590
because they're not
really Jehovah's Witness."

00:54:28.590 --> 00:54:31.630
You know what I mean.

00:54:31.630 --> 00:54:38.800
In terms of tax exemption, being
the, really the only country

00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:46.260
with a stable disestablished
column, at least,

00:54:46.260 --> 00:54:49.260
the United States was
kind of on it's own,

00:54:49.260 --> 00:54:54.300
which is really,
really remarkable.

00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:55.620
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Any
other quick questions?

00:54:55.620 --> 00:54:57.810
Luke has one over here.

00:54:57.810 --> 00:54:59.110
Last question.

00:54:59.110 --> 00:55:01.330
&gt;&gt; Okay. Sally, I was
interested in the fact

00:55:01.330 --> 00:55:03.920
that you mentioned
Massachusetts was the first

00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:06.140
to pass tax exemption,
and they're the last

00:55:06.140 --> 00:55:08.580
to disestablish the
church, right?

00:55:08.580 --> 00:55:09.880
So they're the state

00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:13.230
where there's still
tax dollars, you know.

00:55:13.230 --> 00:55:14.540
They're actually supporting,

00:55:14.540 --> 00:55:17.130
I guess the congressional
church up until 1833.

00:55:17.130 --> 00:55:18.830
Is there a link between
Massachusetts,

00:55:18.830 --> 00:55:21.570
I mean is that sort of the
backlash to disestablishment

00:55:21.570 --> 00:55:23.480
that they get tax
exemptions at least.

00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:24.780
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sarah Barringer
Gordon: There are a couple

00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:27.110
of backlashes, I think
that's a great question.

00:55:27.110 --> 00:55:31.830
The other thing, so in 1837,
they passed tax exemption.

00:55:31.830 --> 00:55:39.650
In 1835, they prosecuted
a man for blasphemy

00:55:39.650 --> 00:55:41.220
and sent him too jail, right?

00:55:41.220 --> 00:55:44.450
So mean, there's
this remarkable --

00:55:44.450 --> 00:55:46.680
one of the things
see for example,

00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:49.750
when a government takes
a really big step,

00:55:49.750 --> 00:55:52.100
they often walk it
back, you know.

00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:54.570
Say, "It's not going to be
that radical of change people,

00:55:54.570 --> 00:55:57.360
don't worry too much."

00:55:57.360 --> 00:56:00.780
And so yes, I think

00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:05.260
that Massachusetts only
reluctantly disestablished

00:56:05.260 --> 00:56:13.160
and they did so truly because, I
mean, they were so duplicities,

00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:15.660
you know, before the revolution
they kept saying to the church

00:56:15.660 --> 00:56:20.100
of England, we have a beautiful
established church here,

00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:21.980
it's according to the
congregational form

00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:24.210
of the Church of England,
but it's beautiful.

00:56:24.210 --> 00:56:26.780
And then right after the
revolution they said,

00:56:26.780 --> 00:56:28.080
"Establishment?

00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:29.480
We have no establishment.

00:56:29.480 --> 00:56:32.210
We just have a policy
of supporting a teacher

00:56:32.210 --> 00:56:34.120
of religion in each town."

00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:37.000
Right. So I mean it really,
they caught themselves,

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:39.810
they were hoist on
their own petard.

00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:42.220
&gt;&gt; John Haskell:
Thank you again Sally.

00:56:42.220 --> 00:56:43.520
