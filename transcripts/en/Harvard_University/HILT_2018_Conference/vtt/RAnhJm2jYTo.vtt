00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:10.060
I think it was a risky, risky
tough undertaking for Stephen

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:14.110
and colleagues to build
a university today that

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.290
was meant to compete with
institutions like ours

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:19.750
for students and in quality.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.485
And they had as their goals--

00:00:21.485 --> 00:00:23.110
I just want to give
you the shape of it

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.200
before you have the plenary
conversation of what Minerva,

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.200
has been, is all about.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.980
The goals were to educate for
global leadership, the ability

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.170
to think broadly and
adaptively to learn

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.110
how and when to innovate
in order to solve

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.620
complex problems for today.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.200
They identified four
core competencies,

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.570
thinking critically,
thinking creatively,

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.350
communicating effectively,
and interacting effectively.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.830
And they built about 100
habits of mind and foundational

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.210
concepts that were behind
those core competencies.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.010
Every student who
attends Minerva

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.670
is expected to be actively
involved in every class.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.000
Every lesson is tied to
specific learning outcomes.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.300
Every learning experience draws
on a combination of those 16

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.800
signs of learning principles.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.020
There are no lectures.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.260
Students engage with one another
through an online platform

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.370
called the Active
Learning Forum.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.440
And it supports real-time,
synchronous small seminars.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.810
And they don't have a campus.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.470
They have seven cities that
are-- that form the campus,

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:35.110
and students use them as
their learning progresses.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:38.870
It was a bold move.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.200
It is a bold move,
but it's not anymore

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.370
what Stephen is tied to.

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.430
He's got a new enterprise
that he's been working on.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.247
And it draws on many
of these same ideas,

00:01:48.247 --> 00:01:50.080
and I hope that we'll
hear a little bit more

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.750
about that today.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.490
It is my great pleasure
to quickly introduce

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.080
the three remarkable
people who will

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.010
be part of our kickoff plenary.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:04.570
Again, I'm not
going to read bios

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.660
because you have them there.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.650
I want to say I am very
grateful to Claudine Gay,

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.280
our new faculty of
Arts and Sciences dean,

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.950
for agreeing to moderate
this discussion,

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.630
and I cannot imagine, as I
said to her as we thought about

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.750
this, someone who was more
perfectly placed to be able

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.720
to do this work given
her scholarly background,

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.020
given her commitment
to education.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.380
Stephen, as you will see in
the bios, if you look at them,

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.450
was dean of social sciences
at Harvard years ago,

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.580
and Claudine has most recently
been in that same position.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.490
So there's a really nice
institutional, organizational

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.790
synergy here.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.820
Stephen happened to be a mentor
for me when I first taught.

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.390
The very first time I taught
as a grad student sophomore

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.480
tutorial, he was head tutor.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.420
And I learned more
from how he talked

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.050
about what we were doing
in those tutorial classes

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.990
about teaching and learning
than I have anywhere else

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.140
and about how to run
a very tight meeting,

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.870
like we never wasted time.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.950
Time was an incredibly
precious in those.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.840
And I am also very grateful
to you for being here,

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.540
for continuing to
care about this place,

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.640
and for doing the work
that you've been doing

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.430
on the global, broader scale.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.030
And Senator Kerrey you
know, what a legacy.

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.970
How many people get to
say Navy SEAL, Medal

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:46.150
of Honor, longstanding
service as a senator,

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.980
deep, deep, record
and commitment

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.610
to education, including being
president of an institution?

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.850
And I found in our short
phone conversations leading up

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.470
to today that the national
perspective that he gave, like,

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.030
we would be talking about
things on kind of this level.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.560
And he'd just kick it up, kick
it out, and think about it

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.000
in this much broader way.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.130
And it reminded me about the
New Englandy, Harvardy bubble

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.370
that I live in, and
so I hope that he

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.760
is able to also help to lift
you all out of our little New

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.860
Englandy, Harvardy
bubble as we think

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:24.940
about these important issues.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.596
So please join me in welcoming
them to our kickoff plenary.

00:04:29.596 --> 00:04:32.026
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:38.344 --> 00:04:39.840
Well, good morning.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.090
Good morning.

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.990
So you all sat there?

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.940
So I brought my dog eared copy
of "Building the Intentional

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.180
University."

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.737
It is a wonderfully
provocative book.

00:04:57.737 --> 00:04:59.820
I'm not at all surprised
to hear that it sustained

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.940
such a lively conversation
among the faculty

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.820
over the course of a year.

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.560
There are so many
observations in here

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.720
that, as I read them, I--

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.610
they stung a bit.

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.439
They felt kind of familiar,
but I think they're important.

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:17.730
And so I actually just wanted
to start our conversation

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.090
with really one of
the central claims

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.770
in the book that actually proves
to be, by my understandings,

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.200
were motivating insight
for Minerva itself.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.970
And that's the claim
that most colleges

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:37.170
fail to prepare graduates
for the kinds of problems

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:41.760
and challenges that they'll
encounter afterwards.

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.970
I think there was one statement
in the book at one point that

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.330
said something to the effect
of, remarkably little learning

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.010
happens on most
college campuses.

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:52.520
So let's start there.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:58.830
So what do you see as some of
the most pressing challenges

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.800
that students who
are graduating now

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.200
and, say for the
next 5 or 10 years,

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.490
that they're going to be facing?

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.180
Did you make that claim?

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.040
Actually, it comes from a book
called Academically Adrift.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.080
The subtitle is Minimal Learning
on College Campuses, something

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.410
to that that effect.

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:20.180
And it was based on
results from the CLA+,

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.920
which is a standardized test.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.810
It's been administered
in many universities.

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:25.940
It showed remarkably
little learning.

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:26.840
Yeah.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:27.740
Yeah.

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:28.580
Unlike the Senate.

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:33.376
OK.

00:06:33.376 --> 00:06:36.394
It has also remarkably
little learning.

00:06:36.394 --> 00:06:38.810
So what are-- so what are some
of the important challenges

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:40.580
that students need
to be prepared for?

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:43.970
Well, from my point of
view, the only thing

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:46.910
we can really be sure of is
things are going to change.

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.940
So from my point of view,
the paramount thing to do

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.970
is actually teach
students how to learn

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:56.420
so that they can continually
adapt as the world changes

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:57.200
around them.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.810
And from my point of
view, the remarkable thing

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:04.400
is there's an enormous amount
now known about learning,

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.820
but almost none of it is
actually taught explicitly

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:11.000
anywhere actually in terms
of helping people figure out

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.250
for themselves how to learn, how
to adapt as the world changes.

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:15.510
So that's one thing.

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:18.080
The second thing is
Joseph Aoun, who's

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.640
president of another
institution in this area,

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.090
Northeastern, wrote a
really interesting book

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:25.280
called Robot Proof--

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.460
Higher Education in the Age
of Artificial Intelligence. .

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:31.420
And he thinks about this
in really some depth what

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:34.070
we're going to need to
teach going forward.

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:38.510
And he talks about three kinds
of things, if I remember right.

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:42.110
One is data literacy, being
able to deal with data.

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:45.561
One is technological literacy,
understanding machines

00:07:45.561 --> 00:07:47.810
so you can interact with
machines because one thing we

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:49.700
do know, AI is on the march.

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:51.140
It's going to increase.

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:54.710
And the third thing is what
he called human literacy.

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:57.530
From my point of view, I
don't think the first two

00:07:57.530 --> 00:07:58.567
are for everybody.

00:07:58.567 --> 00:08:01.150
I don't think everybody is going
to want to become a data geek

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:04.730
and get really into how
you interact with machines.

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:07.750
But the human part I
see is really central.

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:10.100
And I think you can
unpack that, that

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:11.840
is think about what
it is that people

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.600
do that's going to be
really hard to automate

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.440
for the foreseeable future.

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:19.340
What kinds of things could
be hard to get AI to do.

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:23.090
So it's not that hard
to come up with a list--

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:27.410
soft skills, which aren't
soft at all, by the way.

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:30.950
They're very hard to teach,
sort of leadership, negotiation,

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:33.200
how you interact with other
people, communication,

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.159
that sort of thing.

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:37.190
We're always going to need
people who are good at that.

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:39.500
Creative analysis,
I mean, when you

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:41.720
think about how we
analyze problems,

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:42.919
we're really good at it.

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:45.050
We can sometimes change
what the problem is.

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:47.310
It's very hard to implement
these kinds of things.

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:52.050
And then problem solving,
which very difficult to do.

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:56.450
And then, lastly, is
just understanding

00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:59.450
emotion and how to
communicate in a context

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:02.220
where emotions, as I gather
at some of these seminars,

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:05.330
can sometimes run
high and how that

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:08.330
can affect the context
of what you're doing.

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:11.240
So context in general
is something humans

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.670
are really good
at picking up on,

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:15.560
and it's very hard to
program machines do

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:17.390
that because it's open ended.

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:21.010
Every time there's a new news
article, that context changes.

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:22.340
It's open ended.

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:26.040
So from my point of view, Joseph
Aoun, the author of that book,

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:29.930
had at least part of it right
for everybody moving forward,

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:31.670
we should be teaching
the kinds of things

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:35.420
that are not likely to be
displaced by automation, by AI.

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:39.620
And we should be teaching
people how to learn and adapt

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.582
as the world changes.

00:09:41.582 --> 00:09:43.040
Senator Kerrey, do
you want to add?

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:46.620
Well, I mean, I do tend
to orient to democracy

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:50.930
and what does it take to
produce individuals that

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:53.450
know how democracy operates?

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:56.220
What are the ideas
that belie democracy,

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:58.070
what are the techniques
that make it work,

00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:01.410
and what are the commitments
necessary to sustain it?

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:04.530
And I'm not saying that
all of higher education

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:06.530
needs to be oriented that way.

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:10.081
But I'd like to see some
part of higher education

00:10:10.081 --> 00:10:10.830
oriented that way.

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:12.380
And I think what
Stephen has done

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:16.160
in Minerva does prepare
those graduates to be

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:20.330
able to participate in
democracy in one way

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:22.070
that I think is
enormously important,

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:25.940
which is not just to be able
to do critical analysis,

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:28.310
but to be able to be a
better listener, to be

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:29.409
able to understand--

00:10:29.409 --> 00:10:30.200
I mean, let's say--

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.340
I don't know how many
people are in this room.

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:33.090
250 people in this room?

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:34.057
Let's say we have to--

00:10:34.057 --> 00:10:36.140
we have to decide which
door we're going to go out

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:38.030
of when this thing is over.

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:40.250
We get-- we have to decide--
we all have to decide,

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:43.730
and majority rules were all
going out the same door.

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:46.881
And once you're forced into
that kind of an environment,

00:10:46.881 --> 00:10:48.380
now I have a problem
I got to solve.

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:49.330
I've got to try to--

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:51.560
I say, I decided I want
to go out that door.

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.150
You want to go out that door.

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:55.940
And we have to make an
effort to persuade people

00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:58.020
that our position is correct.

00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:00.230
And if we lose, we
have to understand

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:04.670
that there is a tomorrow, that
checking out doesn't work,

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:06.740
and it's appalling--

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:10.580
I'm going to associate
myself with a comedian I once

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:14.900
heard that said that
83.65% of all facts

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:16.020
are made up on the spot.

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:17.210
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:21.650
But I do have a fading
recollection of a survey that

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:24.950
was done a number of years
ago, where 75% of Americans

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:26.630
can name all three
of the Three Stooges,

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:31.070
but 20% can't name one
Supreme Court Justice, very

00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:33.140
difficult for me to
imagine, and we now

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:36.110
have a president who knows
less than any president

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:39.680
in the history of the
country and revels in it.

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:42.950
He is actually selling the
idea that we're all better off

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:46.580
being stupid, genuinely does.

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:50.450
And we're not all
better off being stupid,

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:53.940
and it can be
difficult, by the way,

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:58.550
once we learn something that
conflicts with other people.

00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:01.066
Maybe the most difficult of
all is when you come home,

00:12:01.066 --> 00:12:02.690
and you say to your
mom and dad, I just

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:04.523
learned something that's
different than what

00:12:04.523 --> 00:12:05.750
you've been telling me.

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:07.700
So learning something
that requires

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:11.080
you to confront an audience
that disagrees with you

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:13.830
is one of the central
challenges of democracy.

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:16.250
And I worry about it, and I--

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:17.960
I don't-- I don't
think it's singularly

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.150
Harvard's responsibility
or any other

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:24.500
university's responsibility, but
at some portion of the liberal

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:26.840
arts education needs to be
centered on the question,

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:29.250
are we preparing people
to be good citizens?

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:31.220
Do they understand
what they have to do?

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:34.340
It's not all about go out
and make the world better.

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:36.970
Sometimes we'll make
the world worse,

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:38.750
and then we have to correct.

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:41.000
We don't always do
the right thing.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.870
So it seems to me that to
prepare men and women who

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:48.170
are leaving universities to
have the capacity to understand,

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:50.630
as I said, the ideas
that underlie democracy.

00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:53.390
They're real ideas.

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:56.870
You know, they're 500
or 600 years old is all.

00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:59.930
You've got commitments that
are necessary to make it work,

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:02.261
and you have techniques,
real techniques.

00:13:02.261 --> 00:13:04.010
I mean, somebody said
to me the other day,

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:05.660
well, it's just all rhetoric.

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:07.880
What do you mean all rhetoric?

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:11.320
Of course rhetoric
is a real discipline.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.370
You know, it's not--

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:16.070
I'm disparaging a
political conversation

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:18.110
because I'm saying
it's just rhetoric?

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:20.230
I wish it was just rhetoric.

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:22.040
It would be more
enjoyable if it was.

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:28.040
So these are ambitious goals.

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:31.040
So what's required for
responsible democratic

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:34.190
citizenship, understanding
human literacy, data literacy,

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:37.820
how do we reduce that into a
set of curricular components

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:40.700
that would be essential
to prepare students

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:42.740
for that kind of work?

00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:46.040
Why do you use the word reduce?

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:47.320
Translate that.

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:49.130
It's kind of like an expression.

00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:53.240
So I always-- I really enjoyed
Erin's introductory remarks

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:57.990
there, and you reminded me
of a book by Elisabeth Rozin.

00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:58.850
You know this book?

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:01.183
I think it was called The
Flavor Principle, or something

00:14:01.183 --> 00:14:05.090
like that, where what she did
is she analyzed ethnic cooking

00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:07.070
and came up with a
set of principles,

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:08.340
rules, that were generative.

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:10.100
It was based on
generative grammars,

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:11.900
Chomskian kind of grammars.

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:14.610
So the idea was you
could have it both ways.

00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:17.910
You could improvise,
but within a structure.

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:18.890
So you could--

00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:21.260
Indian food, or Chinese
food, or whatever and not

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.600
according to a
lockstep set of recipes

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:26.600
where you had to follow
really precisely,

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:29.100
but according to a set
of general principles.

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:31.900
So it seems to me what
we really want to teach

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:34.606
are generative principles.

00:14:34.606 --> 00:14:35.730
Things are going to change.

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:37.105
They're going to
go out of style.

00:14:37.105 --> 00:14:39.260
I'm not going to
fixate on specifics.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.600
We want to teach
things that will serve

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.790
in good stead moving forward.

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:46.550
So from my perspective, a
general education program

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:47.880
is absolute critical for that.

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.150
That's where you should
lay down the foundations.

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:52.100
But there's a problem.

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:54.740
We know from the
science of learning,

00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:58.610
the greatest single challenge is
something called far transfer.

00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:00.710
They learn something
in one context,

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:04.150
and then they just
don't use it in another.

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:06.911
There is near transfer where
the contexts are similar, far,

00:15:06.911 --> 00:15:08.660
where they're quite
different, where there

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:12.410
is some underlying similarities,
not obvious how to transfer it.

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:16.200
The only way you can get far
transfer, as far as I can tell,

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.530
is make sure they
understand their principles

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:23.490
and give them lots of
varied examples over time.

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:26.734
So you can't just have a
general education program,

00:15:26.734 --> 00:15:29.150
and then leave, and then just
forget about all that stuff.

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:31.280
It's somehow got
to be integrated

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:35.777
and picked up on in subsequent
components of the curriculum.

00:15:35.777 --> 00:15:37.610
So the curriculum has
got general education.

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:38.443
It's got the majors.

00:15:38.443 --> 00:15:39.560
It's got electives.

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:40.820
That's the curriculum.

00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:42.890
You've got to get
threads that go through

00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:46.280
and tie together,
integrate, and lead students

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:48.380
to see what the
underlying principles are

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:50.800
that can be generalized.

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:52.090
Right.

00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:54.080
So I would be very
interested to hear you just

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:56.060
talk a little bit
about, especially

00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:58.580
from your own experience,
about the work

00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:02.360
of translating some set of
evidence-based principles

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.860
into action.

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:09.230
So you know, taking one example
from your own work, you know,

00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:13.160
what is a principle that you
try to bring into your teaching,

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:16.260
into your leadership, that
was transformative for you,

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:17.510
that was especially effective?

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:20.760
How did you go about doing that?

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:24.200
So let me-- let me, if I
can start on this one--

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:24.760
Sure.

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:25.880
Sure.

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:28.220
Two things that came out
of Minerva that I think

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:31.050
might be relevant
and interesting,

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:33.740
the first is the whole
science of learning piece,

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:36.159
sort of boiling down this
gigantic literature, which

00:16:36.159 --> 00:16:37.450
I don't think anybody has read.

00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:39.070
I've certainly not
read all of it.

00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:42.620
But I've read a fair amount
and trying to figure out

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:44.130
how to actually implement that.

00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:46.990
And as Erin pointed out, I
summarized that literature

00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:49.640
as a chapter in that
book, organized it

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:52.410
into the 16 principles,
two of which

00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:55.280
are interesting,
easy to understand,

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:57.510
which is space practice.

00:16:57.510 --> 00:17:01.720
So just like you don't want
to have one thick coat.

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:04.453
So when I was younger,
I bought a used--

00:17:04.453 --> 00:17:05.869
a graduate-- a
graduate student, I

00:17:05.869 --> 00:17:07.715
bought a used desk
that was black.

00:17:07.715 --> 00:17:09.170
It was hideous.

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:11.839
So I decided it would
look a lot better white.

00:17:11.839 --> 00:17:16.190
But I was in a hurry, so I
poured the white paint onto it

00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:19.410
and smeared it
around, let it dry,

00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:20.660
and then you know it happened.

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:24.980
For a while, it looked OK, and
then it peeled up, and cracked.

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:26.210
You get what you--

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:26.839
yeah.

00:17:26.839 --> 00:17:30.790
So the way you're supposed to
do it is a lot of thin coats.

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:36.380
OK, so spaced practice is like
thin coats staggered over time,

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:38.420
much better for
learning than cramming.

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:42.246
Cramming is the classic
example of massed practice.

00:17:42.246 --> 00:17:43.120
It doesn't work well.

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:45.590
They'll learn it for the
test, and they forget it.

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:48.410
So trying to implement
that is difficult

00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:51.260
because the typical tendency
is to teach this subject,

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:54.050
move to the next lecture,
teach that subject, next one.

00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:58.520
Whereas spaced practice suggests
you got to be returning.

00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:01.740
You've got to revisit
what you did before.

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:05.300
It's just hard to
actually implement that,

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:07.550
even though we know it works.

00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:10.070
You can do it by having
quizzes that are cumulative.

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:12.082
That's one way that we hit on.

00:18:12.082 --> 00:18:13.790
Another thing we did
is we tried to think

00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:16.670
of a principal way of
producing the learning

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:19.080
outcomes, the
learning objectives.

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:22.040
The key, one key,
is you have to know

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:24.600
what it is you want them to be
able to do when they get out.

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:26.840
I mean, it seems so
obvious, but you really

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:29.270
did-- you really
need to back into it.

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:33.440
So I try to think of a principal
way with these habits of mind

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.450
and foundational concepts
that Erin referred to,

00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:38.870
which is core to our general
education program, which

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:40.870
was a year long.

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:45.180
And the idea was to
use production systems.

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:49.740
So I see Stewart
out there somewhere.

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:51.620
So a production system
was an early attempt

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:54.560
in an artificial
intelligence framework that

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:56.450
was largely popular
at Carnegie Mellon,

00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:58.610
if I remember right,
Newell and Simon.

00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:02.540
So the idea was you have
if-then construction,

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:06.620
so if it's raining,
then get an umbrella.

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:09.200
So there's a condition
part and an action part,

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:13.010
condition which is satisfied
triggers the action.

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:15.436
And there was tons and
tons of these things.

00:19:15.436 --> 00:19:17.060
And the idea was
it'll be like dominoes

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:19.385
because once a trigger
is get an umbrella,

00:19:19.385 --> 00:19:22.010
there's another one that says if
you want to get umbrella, then

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:24.350
go look in your closet
or look at the front door

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:25.190
or whatever it is.

00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:26.270
So there are a whole
set of these things

00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:27.260
that were together.

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:33.890
So thought about habits of mind
in terms of the condition part

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:37.962
being really straightforward
and relatively easy to implement

00:19:37.962 --> 00:19:39.170
so it could become automatic.

00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:41.300
That's where the habit
idea came from, automatic.

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:43.550
So for example, one
of the ones at Minerva

00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:47.450
is when you're
speaking to a group,

00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:52.140
adjust what you say to be
appropriate for that group.

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:54.135
So think about it, speaking
to a group is easy.

00:19:54.135 --> 00:19:55.760
I mean, it just
triggers automatically.

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:56.990
There it is, right?

00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:59.090
But think about the second part.

00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:00.719
Well, how do you adjust it?

00:20:00.719 --> 00:20:02.510
Well, it depends on
what you're interested,

00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:05.150
how much you already know,
how much time we have,

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:06.320
what my agenda is.

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:07.550
It's hard.

00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:10.520
So when you teach,
here's the force of it.

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:12.590
When you teach, you
want to focus mostly

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:13.820
on that second part.

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:15.590
That's where it's hard.

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:18.440
Whereas the foundational
concepts are usually

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:19.790
the other way around.

00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:22.880
Like with a t-test, a
simple statistical test,

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:24.750
the action part's really easy.

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:27.110
You just do this little
formula, compute it.

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:29.460
The hard part is knowing
when to apply it.

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:31.440
That's where
students get hung up.

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:34.400
So by using this framework
of production systems

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.820
to define these two classes
of learning objectives,

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:40.090
one is where the
condition part's hard,

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:42.530
the action's pretty
easy and vice versa, It

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:46.340
focused our attention
on where to teach.

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:48.680
This sounds really good, right?

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:52.340
Well, guess what, we're
dealing with faculty

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:56.420
who are trained elsewhere
in different systems.

00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:59.660
So you know they tend to do?

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:03.140
What they're used to, the
way they were trained.

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:05.030
So to get faculty--

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:07.580
I spent a month at
a training course,

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:09.650
by the way, put together
with our new faculty

00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:13.020
to try to get them to think
about things in different ways.

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:14.690
And it worked for a
while, but then it

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:17.360
starts eroding a little bit.

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.550
Old habits die hard.

00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:21.061
So that was a big challenge.

00:21:21.061 --> 00:21:23.310
There's actually a little
chapter in the book on that.

00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:23.960
Yeah.

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:25.250
Well, actually, what are
some the common challenges

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:27.470
that you found in
training the Minerva

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:30.830
faculty to adopt this approach.

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:33.980
My assumption is that most
of the Minerva faculty

00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:36.650
didn't actually attend an
intentional university,

00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:39.080
so they had a lot of
learning to do as well.

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:41.330
So yeah, what are some of
the common things you found?

00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:44.210
Well, the most
common problem we had

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:49.460
was the sage on the
stage impulse, the idea

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:52.730
that I'm really not
teaching well if they

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:55.620
didn't take a lot of notes.

00:21:55.620 --> 00:22:00.270
And, you know, I should be
conveying a lot of information.

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:04.220
So the whole structure
of Minerva classes

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:06.350
is based on active
learning because that's

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:08.516
how you can really implement
the science of learning

00:22:08.516 --> 00:22:10.340
effectively, get
them to do things.

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:12.110
But they have to know
something in order

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:14.180
to do something with it, right?

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:16.430
So the model there was
a flipped classroom

00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:18.350
where they did a lot
of reading in advance

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:21.440
and so forth, some nights
watched videos, watched tapes,

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:25.460
and then in class, the idea was
to have them actively engaged

00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:26.730
as Erin--

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:27.530
Erin said.

00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:29.690
But there was a tendency
for a lot of faculty

00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:31.740
to feel like they really
needed to intervene,

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:33.610
they really needed
to supplement,

00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:36.110
and so forth, which is coming
from a good place, by the way,

00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:38.630
I don't mean to say that
it's completely misguided.

00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:42.470
But it takes some
artistry to do that

00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:45.320
in a way that doesn't undermine
the students' the students'

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:47.964
motivation.

00:22:47.964 --> 00:22:49.880
Senator Kerrey, can you
speak to this question

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:52.560
of some examples in
your own experience

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:55.940
where you've tried to translate
some evidence-based principle

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:57.860
and put it into practice?

00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:00.380
Not really.

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:03.800
No, but I-- some of these are
really quite appealing to me

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:07.570
about Minerva,
that drew me to it.

00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:10.790
I mean, Stephen's presence
helped a great deal.

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:16.035
I mean, and one of the-- one
of the presumptions in keeping

00:23:16.035 --> 00:23:17.660
the students together,
but sending them

00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:20.326
out to international
cities is based upon,

00:23:20.326 --> 00:23:21.950
not-- it's not actually
based, but it's

00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:23.449
connected to an
experience that I've

00:23:23.449 --> 00:23:27.290
had over and over and over,
which is if you put yourself

00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:29.990
in an uncomfortable
position intentionally,

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:33.680
and I'm talking
culturally uncomfortable,

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:36.241
and you are respectful,
there's a lot

00:23:36.241 --> 00:23:37.490
that you can learn in a hurry.

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:40.820
You can learn to
conquer your discomfort,

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:43.820
and as a consequence, you begin
to understand the culture,

00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:46.190
and you make new friends,
and all of a sudden,

00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:48.926
knowledge becomes
different because it's--

00:23:48.926 --> 00:23:52.802
it's going to look different
in different cities

00:23:52.802 --> 00:23:53.760
and different cultures.

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:57.260
So I love the idea that
it's a residential program,

00:23:57.260 --> 00:23:59.640
but the students after they
do their foundation year

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:02.090
in San Francisco are
going to be in six

00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:05.390
different international
cities before they graduate.

00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:07.940
The fork in the road
actually that I also

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:12.400
like that gets into a bit of
controversy, which I enjoy,

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:13.820
I actually don't like--

00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:16.250
I like arguments better than
dialogue, just so you know.

00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:19.700
So when this gets into Q&amp;A,
if I bring somebody to tears,

00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:20.900
I apologize ahead of time.

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:26.080
When I was president
the New School,

00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:30.149
one things I was aware of is the
cost of maintaining buildings.

00:24:30.149 --> 00:24:31.940
You've got to pass them
on to the students.

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:34.250
And the most difficult
fork in the road

00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:37.130
is, I'm just asking
this question,

00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:38.960
as an adult, if you
want to learn something

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:41.600
do you go sit in a classroom
and wait for somebody to show up

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:43.460
and teach you.

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:45.720
It's apt to be you're
pulling up your cell phone.

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:48.590
It's apt to be that you're
looking at software.

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:51.920
So what Minerva did is
built a virtual classroom,

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:55.050
but Stephen is sitting right
next to the guy who's doing.

00:24:55.050 --> 00:24:56.720
He doesn't have to
go down and schedule

00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:59.510
a meeting in of the IT people.

00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:01.640
The platform, the
virtual classroom,

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:03.770
is built for Stephen.

00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:07.870
And if it works academically,
it works technically.

00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:09.410
And if it doesn't
work academically,

00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:10.670
it doesn't work technically.

00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:13.770
And there have been challenges
all the way along the line.

00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:15.720
And you cannot come to class--

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:17.950
this is also
connected to something

00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:20.000
that I've learned
along the way, and I

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.450
see failures in every
organization, not just higher

00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:24.780
education.

00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:27.860
If you pass by something
that's substandard

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:31.430
and don't do anything about
it, that's the new standard.

00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:33.350
And you see it all the time.

00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:37.070
So the hardest standard
to keep fixed on

00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:41.360
is expecting the
students to do the work.

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:45.020
And you can't come into
a Minerva classroom

00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:48.800
and sit in the back row because
the professor knows what you

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:50.940
know and what you don't know.

00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:53.000
And by the way, Minerva
is not hiring adjuncts.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.200
We don't do it on the cheap.

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:57.650
We're not trying to get the
cheapest people you possibly

00:25:57.650 --> 00:26:01.310
can because our own experience
is that you're much more

00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:05.780
likely to have low-performing
people if that's all you do.

00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:07.490
But there's real engagement.

00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:08.570
It's hard.

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:10.790
It's really hard.

00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:12.920
You know, if you've
got students that

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:15.200
have an interest in
Minerva, I would recommend

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.095
you really do an
evaluation whether or not

00:26:17.095 --> 00:26:17.970
they can do the work.

00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:19.140
It's not easy.

00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:22.437
The standard is very high
in terms of performance.

00:26:22.437 --> 00:26:24.770
The last thing I would say
is, my own experience in life

00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:26.155
taught me this, that--

00:26:26.155 --> 00:26:28.247
and I heard a lot
in higher education.

00:26:28.247 --> 00:26:29.330
I heard a lot in politics.

00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:30.720
But just stick with politics.

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:32.840
I know there's a little politics
going on in higher education

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:33.339
as well.

00:26:33.339 --> 00:26:39.050
But the word hypocrite
gets thrown around a lot.

00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:40.670
You're a hypocrite.

00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:43.940
Well, I'm now when people say
to me you're a hypocrite, I say,

00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:44.840
well, that's--

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:48.230
that's evidence that
I have standards.

00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:52.430
I'm not capable of hypocrisy
unless I've got standards

00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:54.710
that I sometimes don't hit.

00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:57.170
And Stephen and I have been
confronting a little hypocrisy

00:26:57.170 --> 00:27:00.640
at Minerva in that we've got
highly-qualified students

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:02.480
that we're turning away.

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:05.030
Why are we turning them away?

00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:07.370
Because of US News
and World Report

00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:09.590
because of the Wall
Street Journal.

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:12.170
They decide what our
standard-- because they

00:27:12.170 --> 00:27:13.847
have a selectivity number.

00:27:13.847 --> 00:27:14.930
What's you're selectivity?

00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:16.280
How many people apply?

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:18.230
How many people get turned away?

00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:20.240
And your quality is judged
based upon the number

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:21.239
of people you turn away.

00:27:21.239 --> 00:27:22.830
That's hypocrisy.

00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:26.930
Now you need to embrace
it, it seems to me,

00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:28.670
because it leads you
to try to figure out

00:27:28.670 --> 00:27:29.961
how to work your way out of it.

00:27:29.961 --> 00:27:32.110
I was telling your
president, I would--

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:35.540
I was 10 years at the New
School in New York City.

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:38.270
I went to New York City
because my girlfriend would not

00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:39.830
agree to marry me
unless I agreed

00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:42.470
to try to have another child.

00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:45.300
And I didn't want to raise two
more kids in politics, and I--

00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:48.290
by the way, I think I hit the
last egg she had because we now

00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:50.700
have a 17-year-old.

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:52.340
And we'd go to
these social events,

00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:55.910
and if you go to a social event
in New York City and the people

00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:59.810
walk up to you and say, well,
where did you go to school?

00:27:59.810 --> 00:28:03.470
And they did not want to hear
the University of Nebraska.

00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:05.966
And I said, well, oh the
University of-- my wife,

00:28:05.966 --> 00:28:07.590
by the way, dropped
out of high school.

00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:09.120
She wanted to be a writer.

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:10.790
And, you know, she
did relatively well.

00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:12.831
She wrote for Saturday
Night Live for a long time

00:28:12.831 --> 00:28:15.230
and did very well as a writer.

00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:16.850
She went to John
Jay High School.

00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:18.590
She would answer the
question, I went to John Jay.

00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:20.330
They thought she was
in criminal justice.

00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:22.740
So they'd leave her alone.

00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:25.100
So I said to your
president, if you

00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:27.820
could unpack this
crazy head of mine

00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:31.530
and take 100,000 ideas
that I have about life,

00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:34.580
I bet 20% of it came from
Harvard or people from Harvard.

00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:38.300
A significant amount of what I
know about how teaching is done

00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:40.100
came from Stephen Kosslyn.

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:41.160
So I said, you really--

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:43.040
your motto ought to
be je suis Harvard.

00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:46.626
Let me claim Harvard
rather than saying I have

00:28:46.626 --> 00:28:47.750
to go to school at Harvard.

00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:50.166
I have to be eligible to join
the Harvard Club in New York

00:28:50.166 --> 00:28:52.460
City in order to be a
part of the fraternity

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:55.880
because I'm constantly reading,
and analyzing, and acquiring

00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:58.970
things that come about as a
result of the democratization

00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:03.740
of knowledge that's occurring
in the modern university.

00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:06.230
And Harvard is
the gold standard.

00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:10.140
So I do think for me,
learning to survive

00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:13.490
in an uncomfortable
environment, learning

00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:15.770
that you can have
very high standards,

00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:17.450
but you got to hold
to those standards,

00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:19.130
and learning that
there are times

00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:23.210
when you have to honestly
face your own hypocrisy

00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:24.360
and embrace it.

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:26.420
Sometimes it's necessary.

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:28.020
Sometimes it's essential.

00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:31.370
People say to me, I've never
done anything hypocritical.

00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:35.490
No, there's nothing worse
than lying to yourself.

00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:38.180
You know, I understand why
you'd lie to somebody else,

00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:40.435
but lying to yourself
can be dangerous.

00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:45.600
I'm not sure how you
follow that, but--

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:46.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:49.145 --> 00:29:51.020
Let me ask the more
pedestrian question then.

00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:53.150
How do you know
when it's working?

00:29:53.150 --> 00:29:55.810
I mean, how-- how
do you evaluate

00:29:55.810 --> 00:29:58.610
when the science of
teaching and learning

00:29:58.610 --> 00:30:00.260
apply to actual
teaching and learning

00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:03.300
is actually producing
better outcomes?

00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:06.430
So I think a key word
you just said was the it.

00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:09.470
What do you mean by it?

00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:12.050
The quality and effectiveness
of the teaching.

00:30:12.050 --> 00:30:14.150
OK, so the first
thing is you have

00:30:14.150 --> 00:30:16.730
to know what the outcomes
are supposed to be.

00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:19.460
So you've got to start with
clearly-defined learning

00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:23.660
outcomes, and you've got to
directly address them in class,

00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:26.030
and then you've
got to assess them.

00:30:26.030 --> 00:30:27.470
It's pretty straightforward.

00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:31.370
But it turns out that we
retain only maybe at best

00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:34.460
about 10% of what we
get from a lecture

00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:36.200
after maybe three months.

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:38.840
Some of the studies show
a lot less than that.

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:41.010
After active learning,
it can be like 70%,

00:30:41.010 --> 00:30:42.950
Eric Mazur is here somewhere.

00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:47.450
He knows this very
well, much better.

00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:49.370
But what you want
to do in my opinion

00:30:49.370 --> 00:30:51.480
is not just test them at
the end of the semester,

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:54.159
but how about a year later?

00:30:54.159 --> 00:30:55.700
I mean, if we're
really teaching them

00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:57.350
with the idea of
giving them tools

00:30:57.350 --> 00:31:00.186
they can use the rest of their
lives, which I hope we are,

00:31:00.186 --> 00:31:02.060
maybe we should assess
to the extent to which

00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:03.143
what we teach them sticks.

00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:10.540
Yeah, look, I think for us,
when you're starting something

00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:15.392
like that, which can be very
anxiety producing because you

00:31:15.392 --> 00:31:17.850
never know if you're going to
be able to raise enough money

00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:19.120
to stay in business.

00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:20.790
So it's not like
somebody gives you

00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:22.785
a couple hundred million gift.

00:31:22.785 --> 00:31:24.660
It's not easy to keep
it going because you're

00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:25.515
regulated by the state.

00:31:25.515 --> 00:31:26.723
You're regulated by the feds.

00:31:26.723 --> 00:31:31.680
There's lots of things going
on that could produce failure.

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:36.030
So it seems to me that
the most important metric

00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:38.374
is what the students say.

00:31:38.374 --> 00:31:40.790
And maybe the most important
metric of all is do they come

00:31:40.790 --> 00:31:43.135
back the sophomore
year after they've--

00:31:43.135 --> 00:31:44.850
they've had their freshman year.

00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:47.709
These are students who could go
anywhere, practically anywhere.

00:31:47.709 --> 00:31:49.125
I don't know how
many of them have

00:31:49.125 --> 00:31:50.720
got accepted into
Harvard or MIT,

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:53.395
but a significant number of them
get into high-quality schools.

00:31:53.395 --> 00:31:54.270
There's no guarentee.

00:31:54.270 --> 00:31:56.490
I mean, we start off
with a class of students.

00:31:56.490 --> 00:31:58.722
We can't say to them
with absolute certainty

00:31:58.722 --> 00:32:00.180
you're going to
graduate because we

00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:01.260
don't know if we're
going to be around

00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:02.040
in order for them to graduate.

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:04.140
Now, we're going to
graduate a class in May.

00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:06.819
So we are going to have one
graduating class at least.

00:32:06.819 --> 00:32:08.610
I think we're going to
have more than that.

00:32:08.610 --> 00:32:11.840
But they came back
the sophomore year.

00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:15.210
Our beginning class,
those students

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:17.640
had to do a gap year in
between their freshman year

00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:20.710
and sophomore year in
order to be a line up.

00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:23.640
Those are really brave
kids that did that.

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:26.170
And they came back
their sophomore year.

00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:28.920
About 95% of them came
back in the sophomore year.

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:32.430
So I think the most important
test is, are the students--

00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:33.870
do the students like it?

00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:35.987
Are they saying, this
is working for me?

00:32:35.987 --> 00:32:38.070
So you're not at a point
yet where you're actually

00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:40.480
able to assess longer-term
outcomes, right,

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:45.060
so how your graduates are
doing after year one, two,

00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:46.636
three postgraduate?

00:32:46.636 --> 00:32:47.760
There are no graduates yet.

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:49.370
Yeah, no graduates yet.

00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:50.840
No, no, they're not.

00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:53.120
This year.

00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:58.830
So at Minerva, the faculty are
singularly focused on teaching.

00:32:58.830 --> 00:33:01.620
And the undergraduates
are singularly

00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:04.260
focused on the
academic experience.

00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:07.140
But as you know, at
Harvard, our faculty

00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:09.960
are engaged in research
and teaching, which

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:12.660
reflects our own institutional
commitment to knowledge

00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:13.620
production.

00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:17.890
And our students learn not
only through the curriculum,

00:33:17.890 --> 00:33:21.032
but also through their
extracurricular commitments

00:33:21.032 --> 00:33:22.740
and, of course, the
residential community

00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:24.630
that they're a part of.

00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:30.150
So from that perspective, how
well does the Minerva model

00:33:30.150 --> 00:33:31.920
travel to places like Harvard?

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:34.530
What types of adaptations do
you think would be necessary?

00:33:34.530 --> 00:33:35.905
Well, first of
all, I don't think

00:33:35.905 --> 00:33:37.459
it has to travel to Harvard.

00:33:37.459 --> 00:33:38.250
You know, I don't--

00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:40.260
Harvard is the best
university in the world.

00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:43.992
So it's not like you've
got a failure going here.

00:33:43.992 --> 00:33:45.450
And by the way,
this is the tenth--

00:33:45.450 --> 00:33:47.490
So we're not-- so we're
not one of the campuses

00:33:47.490 --> 00:33:49.940
where students learn
remarkably little?

00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:55.530
I-- I don't make that
claim at all because,

00:33:55.530 --> 00:33:58.289
look, I think the most
important learning occurs

00:33:58.289 --> 00:33:59.580
after you leave college anyway.

00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:02.410
So the question is, are you
are you prepared to learn?

00:34:02.410 --> 00:34:04.680
Are you willing to learn?

00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:06.750
Do you have a sufficient
amount of humility

00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:09.989
to recognize that the most
productive moment of your life

00:34:09.989 --> 00:34:12.449
occurs right after you
discover something you believed

00:34:12.449 --> 00:34:15.120
for a long time is wrong?

00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:17.420
So do you have that
attitude when you graduate?

00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:20.070
It's going to determine
how well you do in life.

00:34:20.070 --> 00:34:21.900
All these kids have
plenty of intelligence.

00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:23.699
They all have plenty of energy.

00:34:23.699 --> 00:34:24.989
The only thing that's going
to determine whether or not

00:34:24.989 --> 00:34:26.520
somebody wants to be their
friend, or their husband

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:28.145
or their wife is
whether or not they've

00:34:28.145 --> 00:34:29.480
got the right character.

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:33.449
And, you know, that's
difficult to teach.

00:34:33.449 --> 00:34:38.230
So Harvard-- the only
thing I worry about Harvard

00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:41.310
is, you know, is
you guys getting too

00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:43.469
worked up over the
fact that you're elite.

00:34:43.469 --> 00:34:46.639
I don't think there's anything
necessarily wrong with that.

00:34:46.639 --> 00:34:48.389
I don't think you have
to be a quarterback

00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:52.230
to have that qualifying
adjective on the word.

00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:56.315
And I'll repeat it, I do
think, as far as I'm concerned,

00:34:56.315 --> 00:35:00.270
a significant part of my
thinking has come from Harvard.

00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:03.930
But I didn't spend a day here
in this class, in classes here.

00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:07.140
So I think you are disseminating
a substantial amount

00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:10.290
of knowledge, and by the way,
Stephen can talk about this.

00:35:10.290 --> 00:35:12.180
One of the powerful--
most powerful things--

00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:14.721
one of the most powerful things
at Minerva that I really like

00:35:14.721 --> 00:35:17.320
is there's a constant
improvement of the curriculum,

00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:19.350
daily improvement of
the curriculum based

00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:23.770
upon actually doing research
in the classroom on what works.

00:35:23.770 --> 00:35:27.000
And so you don't have to have
committee meetings to discuss

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.440
the general education curricula.

00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:33.097
You don't have to have, you
know, these painful gatherings,

00:35:33.097 --> 00:35:35.430
having a meeting to decide
how many more meetings you're

00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:36.013
going to have.

00:35:36.013 --> 00:35:37.840
None of that has to--

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:38.600
has to occur.

00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:40.170
And I understand it's necessary.

00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:42.000
I'm not-- I'm being
critical of it

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.860
in a well-established,
400-year-old institution.

00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:48.180
But at Minerva, there
is research going on,

00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:50.670
and the research is, what works?

00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:52.980
You should elaborate on that.

00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:58.210
Let me loop back a little bit.

00:35:58.210 --> 00:36:00.820
I think your question
really struck

00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:04.200
to the heart of an
essential tension at an R1,

00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:07.710
at a place like Harvard, which
is the incentive structure here

00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:10.480
is set up around research.

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:11.910
That's how people get promoted.

00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:14.170
That's what's really rewarding.

00:36:14.170 --> 00:36:19.050
So how do you integrate
the research culture

00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:20.250
with high-quality teaching?

00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:22.230
I think that really
is in some sense

00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:27.060
the core of the dilemma
that's facing Harvard.

00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:29.920
So when I first started--

00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:34.260
so I was the first faculty
member hired at Minerva,

00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:36.880
and I set up the academic
program there, and so on.

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:39.930
And one of the first
things that I worried about

00:36:39.930 --> 00:36:42.690
was the fact we had no labs.

00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:45.810
And what if the students
wanted to go to med school?

00:36:45.810 --> 00:36:47.340
What was going to happen?

00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:51.691
So I sent email to deans
of several medical schools,

00:36:51.691 --> 00:36:53.940
and arranged phone calls,
and talked to them about it,

00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:54.600
and just--

00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:56.760
I call it the beaker problem.

00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:59.010
We have no beakers
because it's--

00:36:59.010 --> 00:37:01.285
all the classes are
taught via a platform.

00:37:01.285 --> 00:37:02.160
It's on the computer.

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:03.460
It's in real time.

00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:04.850
It's a seminar.

00:37:04.850 --> 00:37:06.430
Everybody is there
at the same time.

00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:10.250
It's not the standard distance
education, asynchronous.

00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:11.640
It's asynchronous.

00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:14.340
But nevertheless,
there are no beakers.

00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:16.870
And one of the things
that came through in all

00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:19.710
of the conversations I had
with deans of medical schools

00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:25.770
is they actually didn't care
about the standard laboratory

00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:29.490
exercises that are attached
to organic chemistry,

00:37:29.490 --> 00:37:31.650
or some of the bio
courses, and so forth.

00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:34.260
They thought they were
kind of a waste of time

00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:36.390
because in the real
world, you don't

00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:37.830
know the answer in advance.

00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:39.870
There are no set set
of steps that you have

00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:41.440
to go through to get it right.

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:44.400
What they cared about, what
they really cared about,

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:47.040
was the students should
have some actual experience

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:51.240
in a real lab like
say over the summer

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:53.820
in a real lab
where they actually

00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:57.130
did experiential learning.

00:37:57.130 --> 00:37:59.460
So I think a place
like Harvard where

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:01.770
everybody, all the faculty
are involved in research,

00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:03.570
and I'm not just
talking the sciences.

00:38:03.570 --> 00:38:05.580
I mean, humanists
do research too.

00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:08.490
Every single one
of those faculty

00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:13.710
has opportunities for students
to have experiential learning,

00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:17.352
to actually see what it's like
to work on the cutting edge.

00:38:17.352 --> 00:38:18.810
I mean, that's the
point of a place

00:38:18.810 --> 00:38:20.400
like this from my perspective.

00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:24.120
I mean, one of my kids went here
and had a wonderful experience,

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:27.660
by the way, in part because
of all these opportunities.

00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:33.990
So I think the deal
is to figure out

00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:37.720
how to systematize that,
how to build it into the DNA

00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:42.600
so it's part of the institution
so that the expectations are

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:45.210
there for both the
students and faculty,

00:38:45.210 --> 00:38:47.440
this is part of what you do.

00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:49.860
And part of that may
involve changing incentives

00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:53.870
a little bit, which we
can talk about later.

00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:55.670
Anymore thoughts on that?

00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:59.060
Well, moving away
from Harvard, let's

00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:00.650
say at the community
colleges, which

00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:04.850
educate half of all of
higher education in America,

00:39:04.850 --> 00:39:06.410
one of the great
challenges there,

00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:08.243
actually there's two
that I see immediately,

00:39:08.243 --> 00:39:10.010
one that gets
almost no attention

00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:12.761
deserves a lot more,
which is governance.

00:39:12.761 --> 00:39:14.260
How are these
institutions governed?

00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:16.640
Anybody who's spent any
time in the K-12 environment

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:19.370
will tell you that
it can be miserable

00:39:19.370 --> 00:39:22.610
dealing with the school board
because there's an election.

00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:26.090
And you've got 5 out of 8
vote to go this direction,

00:39:26.090 --> 00:39:28.310
have an election, and
those five get thrown out

00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:30.780
of office because of the
conflicting objectives

00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:33.080
that the population has.

00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:34.175
I want to save money.

00:39:34.175 --> 00:39:35.300
I want to spend more money.

00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:37.120
I want to make sure
they're prepared for work.

00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:38.495
I want them prepared
for college.

00:39:38.495 --> 00:39:40.130
I want them to learn
foreign languages.

00:39:40.130 --> 00:39:41.588
I want them to
learn sex education.

00:39:41.588 --> 00:39:42.170
Whatever.

00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:44.330
We just we have all these
different things we want.

00:39:44.330 --> 00:39:47.390
And the public school board
has to make that decision.

00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:50.440
Well, the same is true
in higher education,

00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:53.540
you know, if you ask somebody
in my neighborhood in New York

00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:56.720
City, in the village,
how did NYU get

00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:58.040
to be such a good university?

00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:00.920
They'll talk, well, Brademas
did a great job, Sexton.

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:02.840
They'll talk about
the leadership.

00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:07.580
But the person who made
NYU a great university

00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:09.020
was Larry Tisch.

00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:10.992
He was the chairman of
the board for 20 years.

00:40:10.992 --> 00:40:12.950
And every time there was
a piece of real estate

00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:15.074
in the marketplace that he
thought they should buy,

00:40:15.074 --> 00:40:17.420
he'd write a check.

00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:20.180
And, you know, they bought
up Greenwich Village property

00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:22.350
for like pennies on the dollar.

00:40:22.350 --> 00:40:24.380
And they converted
a commuter school

00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:28.010
into a residential
university as a consequence.

00:40:28.010 --> 00:40:31.567
Well, governance in
the community college

00:40:31.567 --> 00:40:32.775
becomes enormously important.

00:40:32.775 --> 00:40:34.483
And second thing at
the community college

00:40:34.483 --> 00:40:36.760
level, and we see it at
Minerva, and you may see even

00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:41.810
at Harvard, I mean, do I
really want to charge somebody

00:40:41.810 --> 00:40:46.160
$600 a credit hour to get
three credits in something

00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:50.330
that they can get
online for nothing?

00:40:50.330 --> 00:40:52.855
And it's there.

00:40:52.855 --> 00:40:54.770
You know, we have
a list of things

00:40:54.770 --> 00:40:56.420
we want our students to learn.

00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:58.071
And we expect them
to go learn it,

00:40:58.071 --> 00:40:59.820
but we're not going
to charge them for it.

00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:02.510
We're not going to give
them credit for it.

00:41:02.510 --> 00:41:05.390
Not only does it lower
the cost, but it also

00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:07.860
encourages them to learn the
way they're going to learn

00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:09.890
when they get out of college.

00:41:09.890 --> 00:41:13.255
You're encouraging them to try
to use available resources,

00:41:13.255 --> 00:41:14.630
and they're
phenomenal out there.

00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:17.330
And it's enormously
controversial.

00:41:17.330 --> 00:41:20.420
If I spent 20 years
of my life learning

00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:23.660
how to teach
Accounting 101 and 102,

00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:26.160
I wouldn't be very excited
if Bob Kerrey says,

00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:29.760
you can go online
and get it for $50.

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:34.050
It can be a little disturbing
to find myself in that position.

00:41:34.050 --> 00:41:35.521
But it unquestionably is there.

00:41:35.521 --> 00:41:37.270
And it's one of the
most difficult things,

00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:40.250
it seems to me, especially at
at the community college level

00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:42.427
that we face.

00:41:42.427 --> 00:41:44.510
So, Steve, I think you're
alluding in your earlier

00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:47.340
remarks to the need to maybe
rethink some of the incentives

00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:50.480
so that we can really
capitalize on the synergies

00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:53.380
between research and teaching
in a setting like Harvard.

00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:57.230
Can you say more about that?

00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:59.780
I don't think I have anything
particular profound, or deep,

00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:01.010
or original to say about it.

00:42:01.010 --> 00:42:04.040
I mean, it needs to be
the case that people

00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:05.780
are rewarded for good teaching.

00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:08.930
And the question is how to
structure those rewards.

00:42:08.930 --> 00:42:12.530
So you can do things
like have more prizes,

00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:15.050
have a big symposium
at the end of the year,

00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:19.600
give some publicity to people
who've won those prizes,

00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:22.310
the coin of the realm,
things like pay raises,

00:42:22.310 --> 00:42:24.500
and additional leaves.

00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:25.880
I mean, get serious about it.

00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:29.590
If in fact, teaching
is valued, reward it.

00:42:29.590 --> 00:42:32.080
Look, there's a terrific
book that's not an education.

00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:33.410
It's on health care.

00:42:33.410 --> 00:42:38.040
It's called The Language of
Kindness written by a woman.

00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:39.486
She's a very good
writer, but she

00:42:39.486 --> 00:42:42.110
was a nurse, a pediatric nurse,
in their National Health System

00:42:42.110 --> 00:42:44.090
in England.

00:42:44.090 --> 00:42:47.810
And it's a story about
the imperfectability

00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:49.280
of human beings.

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:53.660
And it's, you know, I don't know
if you think we're perfectable,

00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:55.820
I got news for you, you
got some real significant

00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:58.960
disappointments down the road.

00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:03.840
And what she's saying is,
I'm a great nurse on Monday,

00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:05.840
and something horrible
happened Monday night.

00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:08.300
I had a terrible
loss in my family,

00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:11.000
and I got to go to
work on Tuesday.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.700
And I can't go to work and say,
hey, you got to understand,

00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:14.170
you're the patient.

00:43:14.170 --> 00:43:16.045
You got to understand
that something horrible

00:43:16.045 --> 00:43:17.120
happened in my life.

00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:18.830
And I mean, it's--

00:43:18.830 --> 00:43:24.260
I'm not saying that students are
like emergency room patients,

00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:26.547
but it can be-- it
can wear you out.

00:43:26.547 --> 00:43:27.630
It's got to at some point.

00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:30.260
It's got to at some point you
can say, you know, this is--

00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:31.880
I need a break.

00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:33.639
I don't actually
know how you do it,

00:43:33.639 --> 00:43:35.180
those of you who
are faculty members.

00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:36.860
I mean, you love to teach.

00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:41.870
But at some moment, it may occur
you stopped loving to teach.

00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:44.444
I mean, so it's
a great challenge

00:43:44.444 --> 00:43:45.860
to figure out how
to deal with it,

00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:48.374
how to adjust, how to
organizationally make

00:43:48.374 --> 00:43:50.540
adjustments that are fair
and reasonable, especially

00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:53.999
in a country where, if you
decide you don't want to teach

00:43:53.999 --> 00:43:55.790
anymore, you've got to
answer the question,

00:43:55.790 --> 00:43:57.623
how do I-- how do I pay
my health care bills

00:43:57.623 --> 00:44:02.049
and how do I retire on a
pitiful amount of income

00:44:02.049 --> 00:44:03.340
coming through Social Security?

00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:06.870
So it's a difficult problem.

00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:09.430
But I think it's honesty.

00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:11.350
At some point, you
just say, I got

00:44:11.350 --> 00:44:14.140
to do something else because
it's a constant challenge,

00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:18.217
and you're being measured, and
you're being evaluated, and--

00:44:18.217 --> 00:44:20.175
and people-- now you've
got one of the-- what's

00:44:20.175 --> 00:44:22.690
the thing called where
you can go to a website

00:44:22.690 --> 00:44:24.292
and judge your
college professor?

00:44:24.292 --> 00:44:25.000
What's it called?

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:26.230
Rate My Professor.

00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:26.980
Rate My Professor.

00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:28.400
Oh, my god, I mean, I--

00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:30.820
I would-- I would not--

00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:32.910
I would quit if they--

00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:36.190
or I'd shoot myself if I
find myself in a situation

00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:39.880
where I get 19-year-old students
are telling me that they didn't

00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:41.770
like me on Monday afternoon.

00:44:41.770 --> 00:44:43.000
Well, guess what?

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.020
Life's hard.

00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:47.000
Go-- you know, that
would be my attitude.

00:44:49.970 --> 00:44:53.560
So what excites you most
about the future, other

00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:56.520
than the next iteration
of Rate My Professor?

00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:59.530
Oh, I'm 75.

00:44:59.530 --> 00:45:01.862
The most exciting thing
is that there is a future.

00:45:01.862 --> 00:45:03.308
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:10.190
How about you too?

00:45:10.190 --> 00:45:10.790
Like what--

00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:12.044
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:13.202 --> 00:45:14.660
I can't follow
something like that.

00:45:17.296 --> 00:45:19.670
Yeah, it was an interesting
choice having two of us here.

00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:22.910
You're getting this
very dry science

00:45:22.910 --> 00:45:25.130
of learning, read
all this stuff, let

00:45:25.130 --> 00:45:26.090
me tell you about it.

00:45:26.090 --> 00:45:26.640
And he's bringing the art.

00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:28.920
And he's like lived it, and
he's telling you about it.

00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:29.420
Yeah.

00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:29.680
So exactly.

00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:30.280
Yeah.

00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:31.780
Perfect in counterpoint.

00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:33.700
Yeah.

00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:34.578
Yeah.

00:45:34.578 --> 00:45:36.072
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:37.070 --> 00:45:41.270
I think we've learned a
huge amount about learning,

00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:42.860
which should inform teaching.

00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:44.850
It's not the same thing.

00:45:44.850 --> 00:45:47.510
And in particular, I think
there's huge opportunities

00:45:47.510 --> 00:45:48.550
for--

00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:51.785
with technology
in creative ways.

00:45:51.785 --> 00:45:52.835
Great.

00:45:52.835 --> 00:45:55.630
Well, I mean, I do think--

00:45:55.630 --> 00:45:58.680
I'm not recommending
any change at Harvard.

00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:00.430
Any change in any
university is difficult,

00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:04.171
but for those of you who think
Minerva is an online program,

00:46:04.171 --> 00:46:04.670
it's not.

00:46:04.670 --> 00:46:08.360
This virtual classroom it's
powerful, really powerful,

00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:10.220
because I can--

00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:12.680
all the time that
any administrator

00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:14.770
puts into arranging
the meetings,

00:46:14.770 --> 00:46:17.720
they're called classes,
between faculty and students,

00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:19.370
the regulatory
friction to arrange

00:46:19.370 --> 00:46:22.100
those meetings is substantial.

00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:24.980
And the cost to heat, to
cool, to maintain classrooms

00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:28.680
that get used, if you
subtract 8 hours from 24,

00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:32.300
you'll be lucky still to get
50% utilization of that space.

00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:35.850
We can recruit faculty
from all over the world.

00:46:35.850 --> 00:46:38.454
They just have to be in
the class at the time.

00:46:38.454 --> 00:46:40.370
The students-- the
students say, oh, my gosh I

00:46:40.370 --> 00:46:41.703
got to get home for the weekend.

00:46:41.703 --> 00:46:44.850
That's not an excuse
to miss class.

00:46:44.850 --> 00:46:48.410
So it is-- and you can
evaluate constantly.

00:46:48.410 --> 00:46:49.700
We process the data.

00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:50.900
We evaluate our faculty.

00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:53.240
We make changes constantly
in the curriculum

00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:55.550
on a daily basis as a
result of seeing what works

00:46:55.550 --> 00:46:57.470
and what doesn't work.

00:46:57.470 --> 00:47:01.130
So it's a really powerful
tool, and it's vastly better.

00:47:01.130 --> 00:47:03.720
I understand it's, you know,
we all like to get together.

00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:06.320
That's why we have a
residential program.

00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:08.960
And the last thing I'd
say, and I appreciate what

00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:10.910
your president said about need.

00:47:10.910 --> 00:47:13.280
He was telling me offline
that if your income is

00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:16.640
less than $60,000, you'll
pay nothing to go to Harvard.

00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:19.730
Well, financial need is
a big problem at Minerva.

00:47:19.730 --> 00:47:23.840
We we're militantly
need blind, militantly.

00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:26.000
75% of our students
are international.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.820
And one of the dirty, little
secrets in American higher

00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:30.860
education, we're
all hungry, I mean,

00:47:30.860 --> 00:47:33.710
Harvard probably isn't,
but across the country

00:47:33.710 --> 00:47:35.450
we want to enroll
international students

00:47:35.450 --> 00:47:37.130
because they pay full price.

00:47:37.130 --> 00:47:39.030
They're not eligible
for Title IV,

00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:41.240
and they subsidize
the domestic students.

00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:43.967
So we run-- we have 75% of our
students are international.

00:47:43.967 --> 00:47:46.550
And even though our tuition is,
what is it? $10,000 or $11,000

00:47:46.550 --> 00:47:47.050
now?

00:47:47.050 --> 00:47:48.410
And room and board $15,000?

00:47:48.410 --> 00:47:51.540
It's $25,000 cash.

00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:54.750
That's a lot of money for
families all over the world.

00:47:54.750 --> 00:47:59.900
So you run into tremendous
need in higher education,

00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:02.420
financial need, that
oftentimes is a barrier,

00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:06.012
and it can be, my guest
is Harvard's got programs

00:48:06.012 --> 00:48:07.970
in place for those students
who find themselves

00:48:07.970 --> 00:48:09.986
with a couple hundred
dollars short,

00:48:09.986 --> 00:48:11.360
and that couple
hundred bucks can

00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:14.150
make the difference between
them surviving and not surviving

00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:17.020
in a environment
that's, you know,

00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:20.132
that's difficult and
different for them.

00:48:20.132 --> 00:48:25.580
So I'd like you to end
hopefully on an inspiring note.

00:48:25.580 --> 00:48:26.984
Uh-huh.

00:48:26.984 --> 00:48:27.650
I can't do that.

00:48:27.650 --> 00:48:28.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:32.495
There is a-- in the
foreword to the book,

00:48:32.495 --> 00:48:35.330
you encouraged us
all to, as you said,

00:48:35.330 --> 00:48:38.180
remember that moment when
a great teacher enabled

00:48:38.180 --> 00:48:39.775
you to change the
course of your life,

00:48:39.775 --> 00:48:41.900
that moment when you were
mentored through whatever

00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:43.980
challenge you were facing.

00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:46.820
And so I wonder if you
could describe such a moment

00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:52.740
in your own lives and
how it shaped the values

00:48:52.740 --> 00:48:54.494
and actions that
you have brought

00:48:54.494 --> 00:48:55.660
to your work and leadership.

00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:58.940
Yeah, I was given the
question before we came,

00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:03.590
so I knew it was on
the way, but I mean,

00:49:03.590 --> 00:49:09.140
I learn every day from
people that teach me things.

00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:14.270
And it-- it usually occurs
in unexpected moments.

00:49:14.270 --> 00:49:17.840
But, formally, I had
a science teacher

00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:22.410
in high school, Mr. Reese, and
I fell in love with science,

00:49:22.410 --> 00:49:26.030
because of his attitude
towards exploration,

00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:29.060
and discovery, and the
methodology of science.

00:49:31.814 --> 00:49:33.980
When I got out of service,
I went out to-- actually,

00:49:33.980 --> 00:49:37.060
I was enrolled at
Stanford Business School,

00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:40.170
and I went to see the registrar
in the summer of 1970,

00:49:40.170 --> 00:49:43.260
and I looked at the
courses I would be taking,

00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:46.200
and I said, Jesus,
I don't need this.

00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:49.430
And the guy says to me,
oh, you're from Nebraska.

00:49:49.430 --> 00:49:50.783
Do you like Willa Cather?

00:49:50.783 --> 00:49:53.360
I don't know who
the hell she was.

00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:54.920
So I went to the
library, and I said,

00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:57.530
I can't go to a business school
if I don't do Willa Cather is,

00:49:57.530 --> 00:49:59.330
so I went to--

00:49:59.330 --> 00:50:01.550
went to California,
San Francisco,

00:50:01.550 --> 00:50:05.510
and I had a professor,
my first professor there,

00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:06.620
taught me how to read.

00:50:06.620 --> 00:50:08.000
I thought I knew how to read.

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:11.210
I could decode, but
I had no capacity

00:50:11.210 --> 00:50:15.250
to understand what it meant
to actually comprehend and own

00:50:15.250 --> 00:50:18.150
a novel or a work of nonfiction.

00:50:18.150 --> 00:50:22.640
So those are the two
in formal settings--

00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:24.521
two-- I had a third
one, actually,

00:50:24.521 --> 00:50:26.270
probably not relevant
to higher education,

00:50:26.270 --> 00:50:30.775
but I had childhood asthma
pretty bad, and I was--

00:50:30.775 --> 00:50:32.630
I went out for football.

00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:35.150
I played football, and I
had three deficiencies.

00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:37.077
I was small, slow, and weak.

00:50:37.077 --> 00:50:37.785
Other than that--

00:50:37.785 --> 00:50:39.210
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:39.210 --> 00:50:43.160
So I mean, I trained myself
to snap the ball four punts.

00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:44.750
That's really what my skill was.

00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:48.730
And I expected to start
my senior year, and--

00:50:48.730 --> 00:50:51.340
and that's when the asthma
really broke off from labor day

00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:52.840
to the first freeze.

00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:56.050
And I didn't make the first
traveling squad and quit,

00:50:56.050 --> 00:50:58.660
and I went home, and my
dad said, you can't quit.

00:50:58.660 --> 00:51:00.939
And I went back, and
I told the coach,

00:51:00.939 --> 00:51:02.230
and he said, just stick around.

00:51:02.230 --> 00:51:03.188
We'll see what happens.

00:51:03.188 --> 00:51:05.496
Well, the first game, the
center snapped the ball

00:51:05.496 --> 00:51:07.120
over the head of the
punter five times,

00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:08.620
and I started every
game after that.

00:51:08.620 --> 00:51:11.327
And what it taught
me, and I've applied

00:51:11.327 --> 00:51:13.660
it is there are moments when
quitting is the right thing

00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:15.350
to do.

00:51:15.350 --> 00:51:19.120
But there are moments when it's
the absolute worst thing to do.

00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:20.349
Thank you.

00:51:20.349 --> 00:51:20.848
Stephen.

00:51:23.590 --> 00:51:27.640
So it's funny how sometimes
really small things

00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:31.540
can compound, compound and
so forth, and end up changing

00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:32.670
your life in profound ways.

00:51:32.670 --> 00:51:36.790
So in my case, I was a
graduate student in Stanford,

00:51:36.790 --> 00:51:38.852
and they have a
first-year project.

00:51:38.852 --> 00:51:40.060
You have to do an experiment.

00:51:40.060 --> 00:51:42.370
And I was doing an
experiment to test a computer

00:51:42.370 --> 00:51:45.794
model of long-term memory
then, where we gave people

00:51:45.794 --> 00:51:47.710
statements, and they had
to say true or false.

00:51:47.710 --> 00:51:49.720
We measured the response time.

00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:52.480
And I won't go through the
details, but one of the items

00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:55.210
was a flea can bite.

00:51:55.210 --> 00:51:59.640
And two people in a
row responded, no.

00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:03.890
Now, I lived with cats then,
so I knew a lot about fleas.

00:52:03.890 --> 00:52:06.440
So I interview them
after the study.

00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:09.610
And one of them said, I looked
to see if there were teeth,

00:52:09.610 --> 00:52:12.354
and I couldn't see any teeth.

00:52:12.354 --> 00:52:14.020
The other ones said,
I look for a mouth,

00:52:14.020 --> 00:52:17.830
and it wasn't big enough to
get around skin, looked, see.

00:52:17.830 --> 00:52:20.380
This had nothing to do
with the computer model.

00:52:20.380 --> 00:52:22.450
So I went and called
back everybody

00:52:22.450 --> 00:52:25.450
who'd been in the study and
said, did you visualize?

00:52:25.450 --> 00:52:26.830
And they said yes or no.

00:52:26.830 --> 00:52:28.990
And I then looked at the
data, and it turned out

00:52:28.990 --> 00:52:32.230
the people said they visualized
were faster for the larger

00:52:32.230 --> 00:52:35.110
properties, like does a mouse
have a back that was faster

00:52:35.110 --> 00:52:37.120
than as a mouse had whiskers?

00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:39.014
Whereas the people
who didn't visualize,

00:52:39.014 --> 00:52:40.180
it was the other way around.

00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:40.680
The thing.

00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:41.860
It was more associated.

00:52:41.860 --> 00:52:44.410
Whiskers is more associated
with the mouse say than bat,

00:52:44.410 --> 00:52:46.169
completely different
plan and strategy.

00:52:46.169 --> 00:52:47.710
So I started studying
mental imagery.

00:52:47.710 --> 00:52:49.540
I suddenly changed completely.

00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:52.180
It turned out there was a
faculty member at Stanford

00:52:52.180 --> 00:52:54.340
named Gordon Bower,
who'd just written

00:52:54.340 --> 00:52:56.170
a paper on mental imagery.

00:52:56.170 --> 00:52:57.550
He was in Germany at the time.

00:52:57.550 --> 00:52:59.950
I hadn't met him, but I
got a preprinted paper.

00:52:59.950 --> 00:53:01.720
So it was useful to be there.

00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:03.970
I read the paper, and
there was a one line in it

00:53:03.970 --> 00:53:05.800
that set my entire career.

00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:09.130
He said, if mental images were
like pictures that could be

00:53:09.130 --> 00:53:10.832
scanned, then blah, blah, blah.

00:53:10.832 --> 00:53:12.040
Well, nobody had tested that.

00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:13.874
So I went and
tested it and showed

00:53:13.874 --> 00:53:16.165
the further you scan along
an object in a mental image,

00:53:16.165 --> 00:53:17.075
the longer it takes.

00:53:17.075 --> 00:53:20.500
There really is
something spatial there

00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:22.190
Gordon came back.

00:53:22.190 --> 00:53:23.830
Meanwhile, my
advisor dropped out

00:53:23.830 --> 00:53:26.420
to join the Ecology Movement and
told me to do the same thing,

00:53:26.420 --> 00:53:26.920
by the way.

00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:29.140
It was 1970.

00:53:29.140 --> 00:53:31.305
At Stanford, they had
this Friday seminar

00:53:31.305 --> 00:53:33.430
where graduate students
have to present their work,

00:53:33.430 --> 00:53:35.080
and it's very critical.

00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:37.330
And Gordon tore into me.

00:53:37.330 --> 00:53:39.130
I'll never forget this
the rest of my life.

00:53:39.130 --> 00:53:41.030
I mean, he really tore into me.

00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:43.960
And, you know, I thought about
it, and it was interesting.

00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:46.660
And the next day
after that, I was

00:53:46.660 --> 00:53:50.080
in the lounge on the
fourth floor, Jordan Hall,

00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:51.340
and he walked in.

00:53:51.340 --> 00:53:53.410
And I was getting a
Coke or something,

00:53:53.410 --> 00:53:55.000
and he started talking to me.

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.335
And we sat, and we talked
for like an hour and a half.

00:53:57.335 --> 00:53:59.560
And I remember another
faculty member, Herb Carr,

00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:01.420
came by and sat and
watch for a while.

00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:04.300
It was like a game of
ping pong with Gordon.

00:54:04.300 --> 00:54:08.530
And then he started coming by
and giving me papers and stuff,

00:54:08.530 --> 00:54:10.480
just dropping by my office.

00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:12.520
And he became my
advisor and quite

00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:15.940
a close friend now,
actually, and still

00:54:15.940 --> 00:54:18.680
is my advisor in
many, many ways.

00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:21.790
And he gave me foundations,
how to think clearly

00:54:21.790 --> 00:54:25.660
and critically, and value the
importance of what's known,

00:54:25.660 --> 00:54:27.760
and be skeptical and
critical about it.

00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:30.490
And he also gave me
feedback, which by the way

00:54:30.490 --> 00:54:32.200
is an important
principle of learning,

00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:35.290
to correct when I wasn't
getting things quite right.

00:54:35.290 --> 00:54:39.460
So having met that guy
just changed my life

00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:41.780
for the better in so many ways.

00:54:41.780 --> 00:54:42.350
Thank you.

00:54:42.350 --> 00:54:44.975
Thank you-- actually, thank you
both for sharing those moments.

00:54:44.975 --> 00:54:47.760
And obviously, thank
you for the conversation

00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:49.540
and-- and for your
continuing work

00:54:49.540 --> 00:54:51.015
on these important questions.

00:54:51.015 --> 00:54:53.140
And thank you, and thank
you all for your interest.

00:54:53.140 --> 00:54:55.220
It's great to be
back here again.

00:54:55.220 --> 00:54:56.910
And Erin, thanks
for organizing this.

00:54:56.910 --> 00:54:59.060
