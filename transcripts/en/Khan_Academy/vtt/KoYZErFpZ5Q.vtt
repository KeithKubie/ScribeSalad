00:00:01.002 --> 00:00:03.460
Voiceover:So we have depicted
here is a unit circle

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:09.300
centered at point A and the
point B lies on the circle.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.172
And then we dropped a perpendicular from

00:00:11.172 --> 00:00:16.047
point B to point D, point D
lies on the positive X-axis.

00:00:16.047 --> 00:00:19.578
So they form this triangle
ABD, and they tell us at angle

00:00:19.578 --> 00:00:25.091
BAD, angle bad, it has a
measure of pi over four radians.

00:00:25.091 --> 00:00:28.501
What I want to do, in this
video, is use our knowledge

00:00:28.501 --> 00:00:32.918
of trigonometry and use
our knowledge of triangles

00:00:32.918 --> 00:00:35.158
in order to figure out several things.

00:00:35.158 --> 00:00:36.995
So the first thing we want
to figure out is what's the

00:00:36.995 --> 00:00:53.453
radian measure of angle ABD?

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:55.855
Actually let's just do that
first and then I'll talk about

00:00:55.855 --> 00:00:59.300
the other things. that
we need to think about.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.119
So I assumed you've paused the video

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:03.628
and tried to do this on your own.

00:01:03.628 --> 00:01:05.708
So let's think about what ABD would be.

00:01:05.708 --> 00:01:07.597
We know that two of the
angles of this triangle,

00:01:07.597 --> 00:01:09.602
so if you know two of the
angles of this triangle,

00:01:09.602 --> 00:01:11.403
you should be able to
figure out the third.

00:01:11.403 --> 00:01:13.077
Now what might be a little
bit unfamiliar, we're use

00:01:13.077 --> 00:01:15.278
to saying that the sum
of the interior angles

00:01:15.278 --> 00:01:18.368
of a triangle add up
to 180 degrees, but now

00:01:18.368 --> 00:01:20.249
we're thinking in terms of radians.

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:22.437
So we could say that the sum of the angles

00:01:22.437 --> 00:01:25.568
of a triangle add up to,
instead of saying 180

00:01:25.568 --> 00:01:29.143
degrees, 180 degrees is the
same thing as pi radians.

00:01:29.143 --> 00:01:33.738
So this angle plus that angle
are going to add up to pi.

00:01:33.738 --> 00:01:36.373
So lets just say that
this right over here,

00:01:36.373 --> 00:01:41.637
lets just say measure
of angle ABD in radians,

00:01:41.637 --> 00:01:48.176
plus pi over four, plus,
this is a right angle.

00:01:48.176 --> 00:01:50.292
What would that be in radians?

00:01:50.292 --> 00:01:52.813
Well a right angle in radians, a 90 degree

00:01:52.813 --> 00:01:55.627
angle in radians, is pi over two radians.

00:01:55.627 --> 00:01:58.103
So plus pi over two.

00:01:58.103 --> 00:02:00.432
When you take the sum of
them, the interior angles

00:02:00.432 --> 00:02:03.123
of this triangle, they're
going to add up to pi radians.

00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:06.087
Which is of course the
same thing as 180 degrees.

00:02:06.087 --> 00:02:09.259
And now we can solve for
the measure of angle ABD.

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:16.820
Measure of angle ABD is equal to pi minus

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.907
pi over two, minus pi over four.

00:02:20.907 --> 00:02:23.623
I just subtracted these
two from both the sides.

00:02:23.623 --> 00:02:25.527
So this is going to be
equal to, you can put

00:02:25.527 --> 00:02:28.872
a common denominator of
four, then this is four pi

00:02:28.872 --> 00:02:33.531
over four, this is minus two pi over four,

00:02:33.531 --> 00:02:36.889
and this, of course,
is minus pi over four.

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:41.189
So four minus two minus one
is going to get us to one.

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:44.643
So this is going to
get us to pi over four.

00:02:44.643 --> 00:02:47.192
So the measure of angle
ABD is actually the same

00:02:47.192 --> 00:02:52.505
as the measure of angle
BAD, it is pi over four.

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:54.986
So that angle right over
there is pi over four.

00:02:54.986 --> 00:02:57.874
Now what does that help us with?

00:02:57.874 --> 00:03:00.963
So if we know that this is pi over four

00:03:00.963 --> 00:03:03.105
and that is pi over four
radians, and once again

00:03:03.105 --> 00:03:04.541
we know that this is a unit circle.

00:03:04.541 --> 00:03:08.185
So we know the length
of segment AB, which is

00:03:08.185 --> 00:03:10.993
a radius of the circle or is
the radius of the circle is

00:03:10.993 --> 00:03:14.180
length one, what else do we
know about this triangle?

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.118
Can we figure out the
lengths of segment AD

00:03:17.118 --> 00:03:20.280
and the length of segment DB?

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.231
Well sure, because we have two base angles

00:03:23.231 --> 00:03:25.498
that have the same measure,
that means that the

00:03:25.498 --> 00:03:28.494
corresponding sides are also
going to have the same measure.

00:03:28.494 --> 00:03:30.419
That means that this side is going

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:32.111
to be congruent to that side.

00:03:32.111 --> 00:03:34.182
I can reorient it in a way that might make

00:03:34.182 --> 00:03:37.104
it a little easier to realize.

00:03:37.104 --> 00:03:41.070
If we were to flip it over,
maybe not completely fit it over

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.653
but if we were to make it look like this.

00:03:43.653 --> 00:03:46.119
So the triangle, we
could make it look like,

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:50.572
a little bit more like this.

00:03:50.572 --> 00:03:52.993
Actually I want to make it
look like a right angle though.

00:03:52.993 --> 00:03:57.591
So my triangle, let me make
it look like, there you go.

00:03:57.591 --> 00:04:07.031
So if this is D, this is B, this
is A, this is our right angle.

00:04:07.031 --> 00:04:09.702
Now this is pi over four radians and

00:04:09.702 --> 00:04:11.854
this is also pi over four radians.

00:04:11.854 --> 00:04:13.482
When your two base angles are the same,

00:04:13.482 --> 00:04:15.625
you know you're dealing
with an isosceles triangle.

00:04:15.625 --> 00:04:20.025
Because they're not all the
same, it's not equilateral.

00:04:20.025 --> 00:04:22.454
If all the angles were the
same this would be equilateral.

00:04:22.454 --> 00:04:25.883
This is an isosceles
non-equilateral triangle.

00:04:25.883 --> 00:04:28.036
So if your base angles
are the same, then you

00:04:28.036 --> 00:04:30.563
also know that the corresponding
sides are going to be the same.

00:04:30.563 --> 00:04:35.448
These two sides are the same,
this is an isosceles triangle.

00:04:35.448 --> 00:04:36.978
So how does that help us figure out

00:04:36.978 --> 00:04:39.100
the lengths of the sides?

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.089
Well if you say that
this side has length X,

00:04:43.089 --> 00:04:45.021
that means that this side has length X.

00:04:45.021 --> 00:04:47.965
If this side has length X,
then this side has length X.

00:04:47.965 --> 00:04:50.070
and now we can use the
Pythagorean Theorem.

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:56.092
We can say that this X
squared plus this X squared

00:04:56.092 --> 00:05:00.103
is equal to the hypotenuse
square is equal to one square.

00:05:00.103 --> 00:05:02.901
Or we could write that
two X squared is equal

00:05:02.901 --> 00:05:06.716
to one or that X squared
is equal to one over

00:05:06.716 --> 00:05:11.714
two or taking the principal
root of both sides,

00:05:11.714 --> 00:05:15.528
we get X is equal to one
over the square root of two.

00:05:15.528 --> 00:05:19.814
And a lot of folks don't like
having a radical denominator,

00:05:19.814 --> 00:05:22.572
they don't like having a rational
number in the denominator.

00:05:22.572 --> 00:05:25.595
So we could rationalize the denominator by

00:05:25.595 --> 00:05:28.107
multiplying by the square root of two over

00:05:28.107 --> 00:05:30.525
the square root of two,
which would be, let's see

00:05:30.525 --> 00:05:32.137
the numerator will have
the square root of two,

00:05:32.137 --> 00:05:34.432
and the denominator
we're just going to have

00:05:34.432 --> 00:05:37.448
square root of two times
square root of two is just two.

00:05:37.448 --> 00:05:39.389
So we've already been able to figure out

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:40.262
several interesting things

00:05:40.262 --> 00:05:42.394
We've been able to figure
the angle of ABD in radians.

00:05:42.394 --> 00:05:44.781
We're able to figure out
lengths of segment AD

00:05:44.781 --> 00:05:47.437
and the length of segment BD.

00:05:47.437 --> 00:05:49.392
Now what I want to do
is figure out what are

00:05:49.392 --> 00:05:53.485
the sine, cosine, and tangent
of pi over four radians,

00:05:53.485 --> 00:05:55.734
given all of the work we have done?

00:05:55.734 --> 00:05:58.573
So let's first think
about, what is the sine?

00:05:58.573 --> 00:06:01.368
We'll do this in the color orange.

00:06:01.368 --> 00:06:02.511
Given all the work we have done,

00:06:02.511 --> 00:06:04.688
what is the sine of pi over four radians?

00:06:04.688 --> 00:06:06.588
And I encourage you once
again, pause the video,

00:06:06.588 --> 00:06:08.154
think about the unit circle definition of

00:06:08.154 --> 00:06:12.949
trig functions, and
think about what this is.

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:15.270
Well the unit circle
definition of trig functions

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.349
in this angle, this pi over
four radians, is forming

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:19.508
an angle with the positive X axis.

00:06:19.508 --> 00:06:22.316
And where it's terminal ray
intersects the unit circle,

00:06:22.316 --> 00:06:24.882
the X and Y coordinates of this point

00:06:24.882 --> 00:06:28.704
are what specify the cosine and sine.

00:06:28.704 --> 00:06:31.604
So the coordinates of
this point are going to be

00:06:31.604 --> 00:06:37.315
the cosine of pi over four
radians is the X coordinate

00:06:37.315 --> 00:06:40.134
and the sine of pi over
four radians is the

00:06:40.134 --> 00:06:42.877
Y coordinates, sine of pi over four.

00:06:42.877 --> 00:06:44.847
So what's the Y coordinate going to be

00:06:44.847 --> 00:06:46.989
if we want pi over four?

00:06:46.989 --> 00:06:49.554
Well it's going to be this
length, right over here.

00:06:49.554 --> 00:06:51.283
Which is the same thing as this length,

00:06:51.283 --> 00:06:53.691
which is the length of X,
which is the square root

00:06:53.691 --> 00:06:56.149
of two over two.

00:06:56.149 --> 00:06:58.284
Now what is the cosine of pi over four?

00:06:58.284 --> 00:07:00.245
Once again I encourage you to pause

00:07:00.245 --> 00:07:01.873
the video to think about it.

00:07:01.873 --> 00:07:03.043
What's this X coordinate?

00:07:03.043 --> 00:07:06.814
The X coordinate, is this
distance right over here,

00:07:06.814 --> 00:07:08.821
which is once again going to be X,

00:07:08.821 --> 00:07:11.879
which is square root of two over two.

00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:18.220
Now, what is the tangent of
pi over four going to be?

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.074
Well the tangent of pi over
four is sine of pi over four

00:07:21.074 --> 00:07:25.346
over cosine of pi over four.

00:07:25.346 --> 00:07:27.714
Now both of these are
the exact same thing.

00:07:27.714 --> 00:07:28.947
They're both square root of two over two.

00:07:28.947 --> 00:07:30.258
So you're going to have
square root of two over two,

00:07:30.258 --> 00:07:34.273
divided by two over two, well
that's just going to give you one.

00:07:34.273 --> 00:07:35.994
And that also makes
since, because remember

00:07:35.994 --> 00:07:39.411
the tangent of this angle
is the slope of this line.

00:07:39.411 --> 00:07:41.822
And we see the slope,
for every X we move in

00:07:41.822 --> 00:07:44.575
the horizontal direction we move X up.

00:07:44.575 --> 00:07:48.247
So our change in Y over
change in X is essentially

00:07:48.247 --> 00:07:51.927
X over X, which is equal to one.
