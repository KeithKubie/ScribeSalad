All the information you need is in the Course wiki,

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.190
which you can get to by clicking this icon, found

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.080
at the top of this screen. In the wiki, hopefully

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.890
you'll find some information that you find useful. For example,

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:16.219
here's a Course Index. If you forget what a construct

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.090
is, you can click here to review the definition of

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.730
constructs. You'll also see a Course Schedule if you're taking

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.168
the class for credit with San Jose State University. If

00:00:27.168 --> 00:00:29.220
you're not taking the class for credit, then

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.100
you don't need to worry about adhering to any

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.130
deadlines. But if you are, it's better to

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.120
click on it and see when everything is due.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.450
The class officially ends August 9th. You'll also

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.970
see an Exam Resources page. This tells you the

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.460
dates of the exams. And again, this is only

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.400
for students taking the course for credit with San

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.630
Jose State University. This also gives you resources for

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.950
the exam, such as a study guide and practice

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.450
exam. And importantly, it tells you how to register

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.530
for the proctored exams. So feel free to read

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.580
ahead, if you have time. So now if you'd like, click the wiki and explore.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.890
You're done with this orientation lesson. And we

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.940
hope you're really excited to take the class.
