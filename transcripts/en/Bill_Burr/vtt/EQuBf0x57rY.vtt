00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:02.460
Hey, what's going on?

2
00:00:02.461 --> 00:00:05.910
It's Bill Burr and it's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:05.911 --> 00:00:09.040
January 3rd, 2017. What's going on how are

4
00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:12.163
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

5
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.100
<v 0>How's it going? Oh, Jesus. What to talk about first?</v>

6
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.700
Uh, no, I am not a father. That's not why this is fucking late. All right.

7
00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.920
And I just lost all my female female listeners.

8
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.460
I was at the rose bowl yesterday. That's why I did not record. Okay.

9
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.740
I watched a bunch of college football this weekend.

10
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.883
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

11
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.970
<v 0>right? I watched a bunch of, um,</v>

12
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.930
a bunch of college football got into this huge debate with Jason [inaudible]

13
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:41.680
heard before the Ohio state game going, dude,

14
00:00:41.681 --> 00:00:44.380
I still don't get how the fuck you guys are in the playoff.

15
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.670
And Penn state isn't, you know, you guys lost to Penn State,

16
00:00:48.671 --> 00:00:52.630
head to head and Penn State one year conference championship.

17
00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.210
That would be like if that the Yankees won the American league east and the Red

18
00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.170
Sox won the wildcard and then the red sox got to compete in the playoffs to

19
00:01:02.171 --> 00:01:04.720
possibly win a world series. And then the Yankees didn't,

20
00:01:04.721 --> 00:01:07.820
that makes no fucking sense whatsoever. And he starts going, well,

21
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.020
I'll tell you where I know we had a, we had three,

22
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.670
the most impressive road wins of any team, blah, blah, blah,

23
00:01:12.671 --> 00:01:16.150
just all of this shit. And I just kept going, you bleed scarlet and gray.

24
00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.170
If this was happening to your team, you would say it was bullshit. And he said,

25
00:01:20.171 --> 00:01:23.110
no, I wouldn't. I be asking why a Washington,

26
00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.460
The Washington huskies were in it like he would have no problem with the team

27
00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.540
that his team beat. And when the fucking camera give me a fucking break. Right.

28
00:01:31.541 --> 00:01:33.940
And then what happens? What happens?

29
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.200
Ohio state goes out and plays Clemson and they go out and proceed to get their

30
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.850
asses by a bunch of Goddamn nerds.

31
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.780
It's 31 to nothing.

32
00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.330
Clemson just fucking completely dominated them.

33
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.790
And in the end ly had sends me this fucking text. He said,

34
00:01:57.791 --> 00:01:59.940
I can see Blahblahblahblahblah.

35
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.670
And then I just sent him a picture of Joe Paternal shrugging and said,

36
00:02:03.671 --> 00:02:04.570
I didn't see nothing.

37
00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.730
Maybe that's what part of it is.

38
00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.330
Maybe that's why they still don't want Penn state to be in there. You know?

39
00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.230
Cause at the end of the fucking day, the end of the day,

40
00:02:17.231 --> 00:02:19.210
this guy kind of fucking, you know,

41
00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.080
it was a lot of shit going on in the shower there when the guy,

42
00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.160
he fucking didn't say nothing. It was so weird about being at the game.

43
00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.000
Cause I was rooting for Penn state yesterday at the amazing,

44
00:02:31.001 --> 00:02:34.440
amazing fucking game by both teams. The quarterbacks,

45
00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.020
the both set like tight or set up zillion fucking records as the highest scoring

46
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.420
rose bowl in history. Uh,

47
00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.290
at one point both quarterbacks had four touchdown passes, which I don't think,

48
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.820
I think that tied of record or I can't remember. And then one, the, uh,

49
00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.200
the red headed kid there threw his fifth,

50
00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.710
I think he was ran and I was fucking sitting way up there. Um,

51
00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.940
he threw his fifth touchdown. So a final score was, what was it,

52
00:02:57.941 --> 00:03:02.110
52 to nine. The over under was 53 and a half.

53
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.020
So, um,

54
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.410
Penn State scored 28 points in the third quarter.

55
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.380
It was just a fucking amazing game. And, uh,

56
00:03:11.381 --> 00:03:14.110
two things bug me when I watched when I was there though. Of course,

57
00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:18.880
there's always something that bugs me. Okay. Number one, the fucking,

58
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.410
uh, at one point they was showing all,

59
00:03:20.411 --> 00:03:22.540
like the coaches were one of the Roosevelt, whatever.

60
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.300
And Joe Paterno goes up there and this is,

61
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.360
he gets a bigger elevation than anybody else.

62
00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.920
Bigger ovation than anybody else. How important are sports?

63
00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.120
How important is fucking winning of fucking game?

64
00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.290
Do these Penn state people evidentaly that's more important than if you look the

65
00:03:46.471 --> 00:03:50.070
other way is some poor kid in a fucking shot mean it's just fucking, it's,

66
00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.430
it's unspeakable. All right. I, I just fucking,

67
00:03:53.431 --> 00:03:57.780
I'm stepping away from that fucking program. I've always liked him. You know,

68
00:03:57.781 --> 00:04:00.000
I was still kinda rooting for him. I was like, well, you know,

69
00:04:00.001 --> 00:04:03.750
these kids here on the field day didn't fucking do it. These other people are a,

70
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.170
they're in a sin of all of it. And then they show, you know,

71
00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.490
they show the fearer up on the fucking, yeah,

72
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.760
I'm just saying I fuck these people. Right.

73
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.620
But then USC and their fans, you know,

74
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:23.040
USC fans are the, uh, the classic, you know,

75
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.030
all day yellow dashes. You know what I mean? Yeah.

76
00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.260
There's just so fucking hard to root for it despite the fact, you know, um, oh,

77
00:04:31.261 --> 00:04:35.130
J Marcus Allen o j pre murders.

78
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.770
Like if they put OJ up on the screen, you know, I wouldn't have fucking show.

79
00:04:40.771 --> 00:04:44.460
I probably would've just to be a cunt. All right. I'm a Penn state fan again.

80
00:04:44.461 --> 00:04:49.370
I don't want the, I don't want, what are you doing that situation anyways? Um,

81
00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.190
so Penn state, uh, U s USC, it looks looking like they get a win the game. Okay.

82
00:04:55.191 --> 00:04:58.010
And then Penn state comes roaring back in the third quarter, which by the way,

83
00:04:58.011 --> 00:05:02.300
took like an hour in like 10 minutes. It was the longest quarter of my life.

84
00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.810
The TV timeouts were fucking ridiculous in that game.

85
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.240
I actually said to my buddy, I was just like, dude, you know what?

86
00:05:08.241 --> 00:05:11.420
This is the most boring, exciting game I've ever been to in my life.

87
00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:12.111
It was like every,

88
00:05:12.111 --> 00:05:15.530
it was like if you were watching good fellows and it'd be fucking three seconds.

89
00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.660
Somebody just hit pause on it for two minutes.

90
00:05:18.661 --> 00:05:22.140
That felt like 10 minutes fucking referee standing around.

91
00:05:22.141 --> 00:05:25.710
They fucking reviewed everything. Everything went the fucking coin toss.

92
00:05:25.711 --> 00:05:28.620
They reviewed that, that that game was like four hours,

93
00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:33.780
well over four hours long. So anyways, Penn state comes roaring back.

94
00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:38.970
Fucking USC fans, few of them left. Most of them stayed and a, anyways,

95
00:05:38.971 --> 00:05:42.060
long story short, they end up coming, you know that they were down by like a,

96
00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.710
I can't remember like 27 14

97
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.810
the next thing you know it's 35 27

98
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.973
<v 2>yeah.</v>

99
00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:55.570
<v 0>Then I think it was (353) 053-0520 seven Penn state than 35 35 then 42 whatever.</v>

100
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.340
35 then 49 35 and that's right. Then Penn state,

101
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.330
I mean USC came back and scored two touchdowns. Right. And when they tied it,

102
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.570
the fucking UFC USC players, just the way they act,

103
00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.960
their program is the fucking worst. They're the F that's the like that,

104
00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:17.480
the type of a program.

105
00:06:17.481 --> 00:06:20.360
I can't stand like you remember the first game of the year when they played

106
00:06:20.361 --> 00:06:22.730
Alabama and when they were coming out of the tunnel,

107
00:06:22.731 --> 00:06:25.570
there's a bunch of them acting like they were these craze dogs at the end.

108
00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.180
Alecia's and they were luncheon forward. Somebody pulling her back. Oh,

109
00:06:29.181 --> 00:06:31.820
you guys all, you wait to see what the fuck's going to happen here.

110
00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:36.140
And then they go out there and proceed to get their asses.

111
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:44.590
But once you God damn rednecks red fucking like Alabama kicked the shit.

112
00:06:44.721 --> 00:06:47.660
It was like 52 to go fuck yourself, whatever the final scores.

113
00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:51.110
And then after all that fucking shit, then they just come out and hey,

114
00:06:51.111 --> 00:06:54.530
good game, good game. Well they just scurry off the fucking field. Right?

115
00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.940
And then yesterday you see when they win, right? They win like first of all,

116
00:06:58.941 --> 00:07:02.960
when they, they, they tied the game up,

117
00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:06.620
you know. And I would say on some ticky tack fucking, uh,

118
00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:07.820
pass interference calls.

119
00:07:07.821 --> 00:07:11.810
But like USC was getting fucking screwed earlier.

120
00:07:11.811 --> 00:07:14.710
They had a couple bullshit. It was just sort of odd.

121
00:07:14.711 --> 00:07:17.330
We fucked you guys twice and then, uh, we'll, we'll,

122
00:07:17.331 --> 00:07:21.260
we'll fuck the other guys twice. Okay, well balance it out here somehow. Um,

123
00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.350
a couple pass interference thing.

124
00:07:22.351 --> 00:07:25.340
So when they scored the touchdown to tie it up with like a fucking minute left

125
00:07:25.341 --> 00:07:29.300
or something, dude, all the scoring that Penn state did,

126
00:07:29.301 --> 00:07:31.970
I mean they jumped up and down. That was a two fucking USC.

127
00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:35.150
The guy they scored in one end zone. This guy with no helmet on,

128
00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:39.110
runs down the sideline to the entire other end zone. Like,

129
00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:44.660
ah, doing that 300 yells like he fucking scored.

130
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.450
Even then I would've been like, dude, relax.

131
00:07:47.451 --> 00:07:50.330
It's a fucking tie game all jumping up and down,

132
00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:53.360
all up on the benches with their fucking Jersey,

133
00:07:53.361 --> 00:07:56.630
spinning them around over their fucking heads and it's a tie fucking game.

134
00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:01.070
And then in the end, right by the way, Penn state totally played fucking

135
00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.220
Marty Schottenheimer Bald Marty Ball. I swear to God.

136
00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:07.100
Like every time they had a first down towards the end,

137
00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:09.470
they just written the first play was running right up the middle. Right?

138
00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:12.200
Nia Center's fucking ass for no gun, no yards.

139
00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:15.200
Well there were burning out the where we're, you know,

140
00:08:15.201 --> 00:08:18.670
we're taking time off the clock. They were doing that shit. I said,

141
00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:19.351
I'm actually still,

142
00:08:19.351 --> 00:08:24.350
I'm convinced that the prevent defense by the way is actually a,

143
00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:29.380
it's a scam that was come up with by the heads of the leagues that is executed

144
00:08:30.261 --> 00:08:34.640
by the coaches to make sure every fuck as many games as humanly possible can

145
00:08:34.641 --> 00:08:38.750
come down to the wire so people will continue to watch that fucking thing.

146
00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:42.790
Once again, did not work. I can't even begin to tell you that.

147
00:08:42.791 --> 00:08:46.040
Just you just going to give them the first fucking 80 yards.

148
00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:49.760
Then you're going to play defense and hope that you hold them to a field goal.

149
00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:53.840
That's a philosophy and they will just, we'll take away the sidelines,

150
00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:56.760
the middle of the field, everybody knows how it fucking works in.

151
00:08:56.790 --> 00:09:00.540
All it does is ensure that on the final fucking three four plays,

152
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:03.870
the other team now has a chance to win. You've been playing defense,

153
00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:06.630
you've been shutting them down. You've been throwing the fucking ball.

154
00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:10.350
You've been kicking their ass and then all of a sudden hand up up the middle

155
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:14.700
every fucking time. I Dunno. Drove me up the fucking wall.

156
00:09:14.701 --> 00:09:19.701
So then when USC finally wins it right after letting up 49 fucking points and

157
00:09:21.451 --> 00:09:26.451
then they score 52 the second day when at the entire team runs down the field,

158
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.120
not towards the field. KIP, go kicker to celebrate.

159
00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:34.170
Who by the way was doing that stupid dap thing, the entire fucking thing,

160
00:09:34.171 --> 00:09:35.460
trying to get like a sneaker deal.

161
00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:38.550
It's like what kind of kicker gets a sneaker deal? They get like half a deal.

162
00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:40.410
They just get it for their kicking foot. Then the other thing,

163
00:09:40.411 --> 00:09:41.700
they give them like a fucking Sandal,

164
00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:48.690
so they don't even go out and celebrate with the fucking kid who kicked the

165
00:09:48.691 --> 00:09:49.320
field goal.

166
00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:53.790
They just run right down at Penn state's band and the whole fan section and just

167
00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:56.460
screamed all in their faces.

168
00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:00.210
And what's fucking hilarious is that game obviously could've gone either way and

169
00:10:00.211 --> 00:10:02.280
if they didn't win, they would've been like, oh hey, good game.

170
00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:04.260
[inaudible] Penn state wouldn't have done that.

171
00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:08.490
But just a completely classless fucking move. But that's how they are, you know,

172
00:10:08.491 --> 00:10:10.140
that's one of those schools will say, well,

173
00:10:10.141 --> 00:10:13.450
the coach just doesn't take any responsibility. It was just like, well, uh,

174
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:16.610
the kids are this, uh,

175
00:10:16.611 --> 00:10:20.880
it's very emotional team and they like to express themselves and have that,

176
00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:23.340
yeah. Yeah. When they, when, when they, when, when they don't,

177
00:10:23.341 --> 00:10:24.690
they fucking scamper off the field.

178
00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:31.300
It's like that Richard Sherman guy, whenever the Seattle Woods you met,

179
00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:34.560
you met Bro, you met, right. And then all of a sudden he loses,

180
00:10:34.561 --> 00:10:36.600
he tries to be Mr [inaudible]. He tries to be the mayor. Hey,

181
00:10:36.601 --> 00:10:39.750
good game Tom Brady. Good game. Everybody's like that showed class. No,

182
00:10:39.751 --> 00:10:43.710
it didn't. Anybody can be classy when you fucking lose, you can't talk shit.

183
00:10:43.711 --> 00:10:45.630
You lost the class.

184
00:10:45.631 --> 00:10:49.680
Act is when you win and you're not account about it. Um,

185
00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:53.670
but anyways, having said that, it was a fucking amazing, amazing game.

186
00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:57.960
Great comeback by a USC. And uh,

187
00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:03.170
is as much as it came down to the wire and there was all those points scored.

188
00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.370
I have to be honest with you, I,

189
00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:08.760
if I could have fast forwarded through the last 45 minutes of the fuck,

190
00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:12.720
that's how long the fucking game was and how long these fucking TV timeouts were

191
00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:16.890
. I can't imagine how much fucking money they made. The game started at one 15.

192
00:11:16.891 --> 00:11:21.880
It wasn't over until like, uh, I have, I want to say like five 45,

193
00:11:21.881 --> 00:11:25.920
five 40. It was just way too far. It was over four hours long.

194
00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:27.840
It was like a fucking baseball game. It's like this is,

195
00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:31.000
this is what I am to the national pastime. Bill.

196
00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:34.500
You know what was almost as long as you bitching about the fucking game. Um,

197
00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:39.150
anyways, so we went to the tailgate and um, I brought that,

198
00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:44.490
uh, that flat top grill that I got the campfire one. Um,

199
00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:48.930
this is not a paid advertisement. Dude. Fucking thing was unbelievable.

200
00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:53.230
It was un-fucking-believable la head was I, I had,

201
00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:55.090
didn't want to go to the game. He was having so much fun.

202
00:11:55.091 --> 00:11:57.910
He cooked so much shit. I make, we had so much fucking food,

203
00:11:57.911 --> 00:12:00.610
we had too much food and it's,

204
00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:05.320
that's why I felt like I got hit by a truck cause I ate so fucking much. And um,

205
00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:09.670
I made these hash browns, he made this crazy egg sandwich.

206
00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:11.410
Then we had chicken wings,

207
00:12:11.411 --> 00:12:14.350
then we had fucking steak and cheese and we still had burgers and dogs that

208
00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:16.720
we're gonna try to do at the end of the game. But I was just too fucking full.

209
00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:21.940
But a law head was fucking hilarious man. He was so excited to cook.

210
00:12:21.941 --> 00:12:22.774
Right.

211
00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:25.960
I'm back in the truck and he's outside of it and this guy comes walking by and

212
00:12:25.961 --> 00:12:28.780
you know when they, they sell those ticket holders, I always get one right.

213
00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:32.180
And he goes, I hey ticket. Oh you took it? I go, yeah, yeah, let me get four.

214
00:12:32.181 --> 00:12:35.500
So these guys sort of walking up to the truck and I'm not doing a good job back

215
00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:39.490
in it in, because the grills block in my view, I'm trying to look around.

216
00:12:39.491 --> 00:12:41.770
I don't want to fuck this thing up in a, so I had to do,

217
00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:45.010
can you make a couple of attempts and rather than blaming it on me,

218
00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:48.240
chase starts yelling at the ticket guy cause hey buddy, hey think he get up,

219
00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:50.980
get out of the way. Let the kid fucking party. And they,

220
00:12:50.981 --> 00:12:53.020
I didn't see the guy going, hey bro, you got, you got to relax.

221
00:12:53.021 --> 00:12:55.030
And Jay just starts fucking John at him.

222
00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:58.690
Like he's fucking arguing when a call and I just yelled out.

223
00:12:58.691 --> 00:13:02.020
I just automatically said, Jamie, just shut the fuck up. I got to what?

224
00:13:02.021 --> 00:13:06.790
I'm sorry. Sorry about that guy. You know, he's, he's little wound up, right? So

225
00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:10.180
we had fucking buy the ticket, hold that things,

226
00:13:10.181 --> 00:13:13.450
the guy leaves and then Jay set up his fucking,

227
00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:19.030
his little canopy thing and he's just fucking, he's just locked in,

228
00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:22.930
you know, Jay's a fucking athlete so he just fucking gets, he's,

229
00:13:22.931 --> 00:13:26.890
he's got that focus, right. And as he set the thing up, like these four people,

230
00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:30.310
we've barely even establish our space or just passing through.

231
00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:33.900
And then Jay immediately they just walked in the whole area.

232
00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:40.450
Like freaking the fuck out. I said to him later, I said, Jesus Christ,

233
00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:41.351
Jay, I go,

234
00:13:41.351 --> 00:13:44.560
you fucking dropped the gloves before the game even started with the fuckers

235
00:13:44.561 --> 00:13:47.230
with you. And he's like, no, not at guys. The guys walking, right. And he tires,

236
00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:49.300
what can you tire people come through the whole fucking camp.

237
00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:52.810
And I just started laughing. I was like, Jay, you're excited to cook.

238
00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:54.470
Say the cookie.

239
00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:58.580
You get a little excited that he finally just fucking just relax and goes all

240
00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:03.370
right. He got excited. Um,

241
00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:06.730
I don't know. We are, we are on a weird are just weird. A great fucking time.

242
00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:11.350
And um, I dunno, I still nodded off a little bit in the first quarter.

243
00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:14.230
You know, I can't get to sleep after all these years of doing,

244
00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:19.360
stand up till like fucking 12 midnight and get up,

245
00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:22.870
you know, four hours later. I'm an old fam. I really felt my age this year, man.

246
00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:26.440
Uh, speaking of which, there was someone at the Tailgate, I'm not gonna say who,

247
00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:30.850
who was fucking slumped over the truck cause they had to go the bathroom and

248
00:14:30.851 --> 00:14:34.000
couldn't. So we're like, dude, we got to take you to the hospital.

249
00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:37.290
We've gotta take your ass. Naw, I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. Fuck you.

250
00:14:37.291 --> 00:14:41.380
Ends up coming back like 20 minutes later, dude. And I feel great because I eat,

251
00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:44.020
I think he passed a fucking kidney stone or subs.

252
00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:45.280
I don't know what the fuck it was.

253
00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:53.000
I don't know what to tell you. Ah, yeah.

254
00:14:53.001 --> 00:14:57.910
So we almost had a fatality lion almost got a gay misconduct.

255
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.730
No, that was the bullshit one on USC. That fucking, uh,

256
00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:06.770
targeting that was that, that was a, I don't know. Guy Jumps in the air.

257
00:15:06.771 --> 00:15:08.720
He's aiming for his chest and somebody else hits them.

258
00:15:08.721 --> 00:15:12.020
Then all of a sudden the guy gets knocked down. Where is his chest?

259
00:15:12.021 --> 00:15:14.780
His head is now where his chest wasn't and the guy was already in the air.

260
00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:18.650
Right. Does anybody give a fuck? Alright, I'll, I will plow.

261
00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:22.940
I will plow ahead here. Um, I also watched the UFC.

262
00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:28.070
I know this is like an old story at this point, but, um, you know,

263
00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:32.210
everybody, like everybody else, I watched the, uh, Amanda Nunez and

264
00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:37.670
the Ronda Rousey Rowdy Ronda Rousey fight and uh, yeah, that was tough to watch.

265
00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:40.280
That was definitely tough to watch and um,

266
00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:43.760
it was even tougher to watch all the fucking shit talk and assholes on like

267
00:15:43.761 --> 00:15:46.140
Twitter and all the means. Yeah,

268
00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:49.920
<v 3>no, really fucking, uh, you know, I've taken nap plug in the net.</v>

269
00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:52.400
They went to get a drink and then it was fucking off.

270
00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:55.290
<v 0>It's just like, like all of these people that have,</v>

271
00:15:55.350 --> 00:16:00.300
have fought and competed in one in the octagon and they have the right to talk

272
00:16:00.301 --> 00:16:04.170
shit like that. It's just a, I don't know why people do stuff like that. Uh,

273
00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:08.340
you know, that happens to every champion if they, if they stay,

274
00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:12.480
if they stick around eventually somebody younger is going to see you're the

275
00:16:12.481 --> 00:16:12.841
champ.

276
00:16:12.841 --> 00:16:17.730
Everybody's breaking down what the fuck it is you do over and over and over and

277
00:16:17.731 --> 00:16:20.400
over again. And then eventually you get run down. It happens to everybody.

278
00:16:20.401 --> 00:16:24.840
If it could happen to Mohammad Ali, sugar ray, Leonard, Marvin,

279
00:16:24.841 --> 00:16:28.230
Hagler, all these fucking guys, their last fight, I saw him loose.

280
00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:33.390
Roy Jones Jr Matt Hughes, George Saint Pierre, right.

281
00:16:33.391 --> 00:16:35.280
I think George Saint Pierre might've won his last one,

282
00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:38.190
but he was all beat up and everything. But um,

283
00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:40.200
and said he didn't remember part of the fight.

284
00:16:40.201 --> 00:16:44.040
So that's what happened to everybody. So of course I texted it to my buddy,

285
00:16:44.041 --> 00:16:46.290
he goes, well, not rocky or fucking Mayweather,

286
00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:49.680
meaning rocky Marciano and it's just like, dude, alright I'll,

287
00:16:49.681 --> 00:16:53.100
I'll rocky Marciano. Absolutely. But like Mayweather, I dunno.

288
00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:56.580
Mayweather owes me like 300 bucks in paper view.

289
00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:02.350
Thinking about that guy. All right,

290
00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:04.750
I'm really going out on a limb here cause I don't watch that much boxing.

291
00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:08.680
I think one, obviously one of the greatest fighters of all fucking time,

292
00:17:08.681 --> 00:17:13.681
but like he's just also understood that final third of his career,

293
00:17:14.441 --> 00:17:16.090
I feel better than anybody else.

294
00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:20.710
How do you still continue fighting and not take that big fucking knocked down?

295
00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:24.340
Part of it or a lot of part was his amazing defense,

296
00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:27.820
but the other is the fucking opponents that he picked. You know what I mean?

297
00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:32.440
That fucking Pacquiao fight should have happened at least eight years before I

298
00:17:32.441 --> 00:17:36.670
was on his side where I was like, yeah, maybe he's on drugs. He probably,

299
00:17:36.671 --> 00:17:40.240
I don't know, maybe is, maybe fucking isn't, but, um,

300
00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:46.360
I don't know all the, I don't know. Boxing isn't the way it was. Um,

301
00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:49.910
somewhere in the 80s that died like [inaudible]

302
00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:51.510
<v 5>okay.</v>

303
00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:53.880
<v 0>That Hagler Hearns Duran Leonard,</v>

304
00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:57.930
they all lost and they all fucking lost to each other and shit. It's just like,

305
00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:02.190
he had unbelievable fighters for unbelievable fighters and they all fought each

306
00:18:02.191 --> 00:18:07.170
other. It's impossible to stay undefeated, but, um, you know,

307
00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:11.430
when you fucking, you know, it'd be like a fucking Ali fought,

308
00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:14.220
you finally fought Joe Frazier in like 1981.

309
00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:18.870
And like when Ali's last fight, I think it was against Larry Holmes,

310
00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:23.640
who then was the fucking champ for like the next four years or whatever his rule

311
00:18:23.641 --> 00:18:26.490
until I think Tyson came along and maybe there's one guy in between,

312
00:18:26.491 --> 00:18:28.020
I can't remember. It's been so long ago.

313
00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:30.900
Hagler's last loss was to sugar ray Leonard.

314
00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:35.910
I mean these guys fought champions right up until the end of their career as

315
00:18:35.911 --> 00:18:39.060
opposed to a, you know, fighting some guy from England with weight issues.

316
00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:44.790
You know that one Ricky, Ricky, uh, Ricky Hatton. I saw that fight.

317
00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:47.960
I don't like talking shit about fighters either because you know, they,

318
00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:51.210
they cannot beat the fuck out of me. I'm, I'm just saying that, you know,

319
00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:53.760
I think it's gonna hurt Mayweather,

320
00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:58.740
the level of guy that he fought in the final third of his career.

321
00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:03.480
Um, cause I know for one, like I just, you know, you'd watch his fucking fights.

322
00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:04.830
The other guy couldn't hit him.

323
00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:07.740
Mayweather could knock him out and he just kind of poo poo, poo,

324
00:19:07.741 --> 00:19:10.950
poo poo the whole fucking fight with this, those white kitten gloves.

325
00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:15.510
I'm just like, this is fucking boring. The Shit

326
00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:20.490
I'm fighting not to lose play and not play,

327
00:19:20.491 --> 00:19:24.510
not to lose like Penn state like Penn state did in the fourth fucking quarter.

328
00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:27.780
Um, so that's, I know, that's my own dumb opinion. I don't know what,

329
00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:28.740
I don't know shit about fighting,

330
00:19:28.741 --> 00:19:32.160
but all I know this is you're a fucking asshole if you go on Twitter and you

331
00:19:32.161 --> 00:19:34.950
start trashing somebody cause they, uh,

332
00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:38.780
cause they got knocked out like they're a pussy or you,

333
00:19:38.781 --> 00:19:43.500
you are overrated or any of that type of shit. I mean, some, you probably say,

334
00:19:43.501 --> 00:19:45.570
I just did that to Mayweather. I'm not,

335
00:19:45.571 --> 00:19:47.400
I'm saying he's one of the greatest of all time.

336
00:19:47.401 --> 00:19:49.680
I would never say that the guy's a pussy or anything like that.

337
00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:53.280
I would've just liked to watch him fight, uh, better caliber fighter.

338
00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:57.810
Um, I dunno. You know what I mean? I like that.

339
00:19:57.811 --> 00:19:59.100
That may weather pack your fight.

340
00:19:59.101 --> 00:20:04.101
That should have fucking happened in one oh five oh six something like that.

341
00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:09.030
Bill. Shut the fuck up. All right. I'll shut the fuck up anyways. Um,

342
00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:11.370
you know what? It really is his adverse,

343
00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:15.480
he fucking said that Mayweather would've fucking beat Hagler Hearns Leonard

344
00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.040
Duran, like he would've fucking beat all of them.

345
00:20:17.041 --> 00:20:18.420
It's like he would've beat all of them.

346
00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:24.540
All of them couldn't beat all of each other. You know, I dunno what he's,

347
00:20:24.541 --> 00:20:29.130
I don't know what he's basing it on. You know what he's basing it on?

348
00:20:29.131 --> 00:20:31.770
He's basing it on being born in the late seventies. I just, you know,

349
00:20:31.771 --> 00:20:36.720
I'm just an old fucking crabby men, I'm speaking of which, you know,

350
00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:40.590
I've, I've been working on my anger. Um,

351
00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:44.610
I got in the car today to return the pickup truck and I, uh,

352
00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:46.240
<v 5>okay.</v>

353
00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:47.740
<v 0>I fucking, uh, I don't know.</v>

354
00:20:47.741 --> 00:20:51.820
I made it down the street around the block before I got into an argument with

355
00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:55.600
this fucking woman who just glided through her stop sign in her white

356
00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:00.790
Mercedes-Benz. I gotta fucking, I got it. Anybody who's got a white Mercedes,

357
00:21:00.791 --> 00:21:03.730
a white, uh, people, white cars, men,

358
00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:08.770
high end white cars are fucking entitled cunts.

359
00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:13.240
I don't like, you know what I mean? They think the car is a classy right.

360
00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:15.820
I was [inaudible] shit like verse, he loves a white car,

361
00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:22.710
you know, it just,

362
00:21:22.711 --> 00:21:26.190
it gets the classiest fucking thing ever.

363
00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:30.450
Mercedes and BMW, they've really fallen the fuck off. You know what I mean?

364
00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:33.450
They just went right down to the bottom feeders.

365
00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:37.770
Anybody with like sue can afford 60 bucks a month, can lease one of those cars.

366
00:21:37.771 --> 00:21:40.770
Now I'm telling you, when he used to see a Mercedes drive down the street,

367
00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:43.500
used to be some fucking guy like in his 50s,

368
00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:46.650
who was wealthy or have a BMW.

369
00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:49.110
Even then that was like a more like the Yuppie guy. Like,

370
00:21:49.111 --> 00:21:52.080
I'm not having fucking kids and I'll pour shit in the drinking water just to

371
00:21:52.081 --> 00:21:56.190
make another buck, you know, Cook the fucking stock market banker's psycho,

372
00:21:56.191 --> 00:22:00.660
right? We would just have it rough sex, you know, that fucking lunatic.

373
00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:05.010
Um, now it's shit. It's like, it's like fucking 21 year old kids.

374
00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:11.460
Um, I think this podcast should just be like a, some sort of theme of like,

375
00:22:11.461 --> 00:22:15.920
things aren't the way they used to be and I'm fucking upset about it. Um,

376
00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:21.200
you know what it is, is I didn't have a good breakfast today and at my age,

377
00:22:21.201 --> 00:22:23.540
that's not a good thing. You know, I woke up in the,

378
00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:28.450
and we didn't have any fucking real food to fucking my,

379
00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:32.810
my frying pan was underneath all these dirty shit from the fucking rose bowl.

380
00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:35.210
That's in the sink. It's like, I'm not going to fry up a fucking egg.

381
00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:39.290
And a Nia has one of those fucking little kids cereals in there.

382
00:22:39.291 --> 00:22:41.920
And I was just like, all right, I'll fucking eat this shit. And uh, um,

383
00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:45.560
I already had the fucking sugar high and now I'm starting to crash.

384
00:22:45.561 --> 00:22:49.940
So I'm being, uh, being a little harsh on the millennials, you know,

385
00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:53.270
in Floyd Mayweather and people who drive white cars.

386
00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:56.120
I can admit that in 2017,

387
00:22:56.450 --> 00:23:00.230
I can admit that this is the new me, the new bill.

388
00:23:00.231 --> 00:23:05.060
I meditate now and by saying I meditate means I tried it once last week

389
00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:10.460
and I plan on doing it twice a day, but I've only done it once so far, but,

390
00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:15.500
but I've been thinking about doing it, you know, and uh,

391
00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:18.500
people have been sending me shit about trying to get over my fucking anger

392
00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:21.170
issues and uh, yeah,

393
00:23:21.171 --> 00:23:24.400
that lady like glided through the stop sign and I just, I stopped, I said,

394
00:23:24.401 --> 00:23:26.750
you gotta Stop Sign, right? Then she goes, you got one over there. And I go,

395
00:23:26.751 --> 00:23:29.270
that's not it. It's the other one. It's just like,

396
00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:34.340
you just don't fucking nother Douche in a white Mercedes. I swear to God.

397
00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:38.100
Do you think if they stopped making that car, people would drive better?

398
00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:40.580
If there's something about people and then they get in a white Mercedes,

399
00:23:40.581 --> 00:23:44.360
a white fucking car, like, you know of up, that costs a certain amount of money.

400
00:23:44.361 --> 00:23:47.990
That's it. Look, I'm good. I'm getting upset again. Just relax bill.

401
00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:52.430
Take a fucking breath. You know, go outside. Look at the birds.

402
00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:55.510
Where the hell it is you supposed to do? You know somebody sent me this. I get,

403
00:23:55.520 --> 00:24:00.310
I should play it now. Somebody sent me this fucking video on a,

404
00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:03.470
you know how to get over my anger and uh,

405
00:24:03.471 --> 00:24:06.110
at the risk of sounding like a heck comedian, it actually,

406
00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:10.820
it didn't make me angry. It fucking upset me though. It really didn't.

407
00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:15.020
Let me see this here. See if I can click on this fucking thing again. Oh,

408
00:24:15.021 --> 00:24:16.610
how not to be angry all the time.

409
00:24:16.611 --> 00:24:20.270
I wonder if I can play this and not get in fucking trouble by some, uh,

410
00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:24.980
some podcasting entity here. See if I can turn this fucking thing up here.

411
00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:28.190
So I, I look at this thing, right? It's a cartoon.

412
00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:32.600
So immediately it's on my intellect level. Right? Here it is. This,

413
00:24:32.601 --> 00:24:34.850
this is what they're trying to say to me. I'll try to play this year,

414
00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:39.650
my minimal fucking um, abilities here.

415
00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:43.160
Oh, for God's sake. So you're gonna play it here or what?

416
00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:48.190
I hit play.

417
00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:50.530
<v 4>Okay.</v>

418
00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:53.830
<v 0>I refuse to get fucking angry during this point. Why won't this thing play?</v>

419
00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:56.550
Yeah. Oh I know. Cause I'm in this room. I'm in this room.

420
00:24:56.551 --> 00:25:00.030
So the fucking in the internet doesn't work all, there's a little spin wheel.

421
00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:03.810
It's gradually fight spinning around. What's going to happen?

422
00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:07.920
All I want to do is play this fucking all. I wanna do room a zoom, zoom, zoom.

423
00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:11.460
I just want to play this fucking video. How does it know?

424
00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:14.520
How does the universe know when you're trying to fucking do something?

425
00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:18.210
All right. You know what? Fucking, I'm not playing. Hey look at that.

426
00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:21.840
I'm not angry anymore cause I just gave in because that's basically what this

427
00:25:21.841 --> 00:25:26.220
fucking video told you to do. It was talking about so and so.

428
00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:31.110
This is the name of the video. It says how not to be angry all the time.

429
00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:34.530
And I would love to read the fucking comments on this thing, right?

430
00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:38.490
This is how not to be angry all the time. And it shows this guy,

431
00:25:38.491 --> 00:25:41.610
it's like a William or whatever. I think you guys actually name was bill.

432
00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:43.680
I can't remember. He, you know,

433
00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:48.420
he likes to read the newspaper and he tells his wife not to interrupt him while

434
00:25:48.421 --> 00:25:52.170
he's doing that. And then it goes, his wife finds it's very upsetting.

435
00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:56.790
So one time he's reading the newspaper and uh, she says, Hey,

436
00:25:56.791 --> 00:25:59.710
when are you going to, uh, you know, set the table but blah, blah, blah, blah,

437
00:25:59.711 --> 00:26:02.490
blah. And William flips out,

438
00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:07.700
he gets angry and it says William gets angry because he has hope.

439
00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:12.210
It was talking about how angry people, as much as they come off as a negative,

440
00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:15.960
directly, really positive people. It was basically saying that they have hope.

441
00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:19.380
So they present all these different scenarios and they're like,

442
00:26:19.381 --> 00:26:20.610
at each one of these cell, you know,

443
00:26:20.611 --> 00:26:23.460
he goes to the airport and his plane is delayed.

444
00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:27.750
He's one of the premier fucking flyers. He gets mad, he goes up, he flips,

445
00:26:27.751 --> 00:26:32.040
he screams at the fucking lady behind the counter because he is hopeful and it

446
00:26:32.041 --> 00:26:35.490
was basically saying that he needed to be a little more pessimistic. Oh,

447
00:26:35.491 --> 00:26:36.900
here's the video. Here's the video.

448
00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:39.300
It's basically saying you needed to be a negative cut.

449
00:26:41.290 --> 00:26:44.550
Here we go like gloomy times.

450
00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:47.030
<v 6>We certainly don't usually think of them as a whole.</v>

451
00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:48.900
<v 0>Why is it so fucking quiet?</v>

452
00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:53.510
<v 6>Gruff snafus? They treat me much to their constitute.</v>

453
00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:55.820
<v 0>You know what? I can't deal with this fucking guy's accent.</v>

454
00:26:57.110 --> 00:27:00.030
I can't deal with it. Oh, I know. I had them.

455
00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:01.760
I had the fucking microphone turned round. There we go.

456
00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:05.690
Do you meet people the Actually, Oh,

457
00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:08.343
<v 2>hold on one sec.</v>

458
00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:12.600
<v 6>And Green. People sound like [inaudible] meet times.</v>

459
00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:17.960
We certainly don't usually think of the past optimists and yet gruff surface.

460
00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:20.950
They truly are much to them.

461
00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:23.660
<v 0>I can't fucking, oh my God, I can't fucking listen to it.</v>

462
00:27:24.370 --> 00:27:25.203
<v 2>Okay.</v>

463
00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:28.890
<v 0>Kenny, when is he going to fuck it over it? And that's everything.</v>

464
00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:33.500
And Nancy had everything gloomy papal deck actually potted the people under

465
00:27:33.501 --> 00:27:37.490
that. Um, yeah. So basically he goes through all of this fucking shit, right.

466
00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:39.853
And he says in,

467
00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:45.070
in to be more positive is what you have to do is you have to accept the world

468
00:27:47.361 --> 00:27:52.361
that the world is actually a very dark gluey place and most things fail and most

469
00:27:55.251 --> 00:27:59.420
basically, most dreams don't come true. And uh, you know,

470
00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:02.660
be more of like a realist in like people who, you know, people get upset,

471
00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:06.280
people who aren't angry, people get upset, um,

472
00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:07.820
when something happens,

473
00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:11.180
but they get over it way quicker and they don't get nearly as mad.

474
00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:15.320
And it's basically because I guess they're walking around going like, oh yeah,

475
00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:20.380
why wouldn't this person in this white Mercedes blow through the stop sign?

476
00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:22.490
Of course they do.

477
00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:29.320
I guess there's part of me that I understand that like I flip out about the more

478
00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:34.540
on drivers out here and I literally say to myself out loud after I flip out in

479
00:28:34.671 --> 00:28:36.410
the car going like, yes, Bill,

480
00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:39.920
you have established that people out here suck at driving.

481
00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:44.990
When are you going to stop reacting to it? And um, you know,

482
00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:46.700
I, I don't think ever,

483
00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:52.010
I don't think it's because I'm like an optimist. I don't have,

484
00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:56.350
I'm not hopeful that someone fucking,

485
00:28:57.630 --> 00:29:01.210
you know, if they're going to make a left, that they,

486
00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:04.130
that they'll get all the way over to the left instead of sitting in the middle

487
00:29:04.131 --> 00:29:07.670
of the lane and now I have to fucking wait where if you just were over by the

488
00:29:07.671 --> 00:29:12.210
double yellow line, I could have gone around you. You fucking cunt.

489
00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:15.240
I'm not like hopeful that they're going to do that.

490
00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:18.460
I don't have like hope that they're going to do it.

491
00:29:18.461 --> 00:29:22.810
I just can't understand why you wouldn't because I know that person has been

492
00:29:22.811 --> 00:29:25.660
sitting behind somebody doing that. It's like when you're,

493
00:29:25.661 --> 00:29:29.680
you're in a long line and fucking whatever and it's moving slow and everybody's

494
00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:32.650
yammering what the person on the other side of the fucking desk, it's like,

495
00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:37.720
just get up there and say what you want and shut the fuck up. How hard is that?

496
00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:41.620
And there'll be a person in front of you look at you rolling their eyes. Like,

497
00:29:41.621 --> 00:29:43.090
I can't believe how long this takes.

498
00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:45.270
And then they get up there and what are they done today?

499
00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:46.400
It's a great day out there.

500
00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:51.490
They just fucking launch into all of this shit that has nothing to do with what

501
00:29:51.491 --> 00:29:52.324
you're doing.

502
00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:53.253
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

503
00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:56.680
<v 0>And it just fucking adds time.</v>

504
00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:02.960
So I'm not, I don't have any hope that people are gonna

505
00:30:03.850 --> 00:30:04.460
<v 2>okay.</v>

506
00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:05.960
<v 0>Maybe I do. I have hope. You know?</v>

507
00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:11.200
I guess I would hope you'd be a fucking not a moron and figure out why this

508
00:30:11.361 --> 00:30:16.180
seems to be taking way longer than it should. I Dunno.

509
00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:18.820
I don't think it's because I have hope.

510
00:30:18.821 --> 00:30:23.200
I think the reason why I get fucking angry is because that is my default

511
00:30:23.230 --> 00:30:26.410
emotion. I think that that's what it is. You know,

512
00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:29.950
I came from one of those families, oh my God, shut the fuck up.

513
00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:33.310
You sit there and take it, right. One of those things, which, you know,

514
00:30:33.311 --> 00:30:34.960
if you're not allowed to express yourself,

515
00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:37.840
you immediately feel like you're not going to get what you want in life.

516
00:30:37.841 --> 00:30:41.380
And I think that that's what is, I think that's why I flip up. You know,

517
00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:44.830
I flip up because of that. Like, you know, if something starts to go away,

518
00:30:44.831 --> 00:30:46.460
I don't want it to go, um,

519
00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:49.990
no one's going to listen to me and I don't have any fucking options other than

520
00:30:49.991 --> 00:30:54.530
just sit there and fucking take it. So I think that's what he's,

521
00:30:54.550 --> 00:30:56.950
I don't think it's, cause I'm hopeful. I get maybe a little bit,

522
00:30:57.310 --> 00:31:00.430
maybe I'm such an angry cunt. I can't say that there's some truth in this video,

523
00:31:00.550 --> 00:31:05.440
but I don't think the solution is, is to just walk around. Um,

524
00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:06.573
<v 2>yeah.</v>

525
00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:12.580
<v 0>You know, just accepting that people are the way that they are,</v>

526
00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:16.120
you know, that'd be like, if you know, you're coaching a team, it'd be like,

527
00:31:16.121 --> 00:31:19.600
yeah, you know, we're eight and eight. Yeah, we're just eight and eight. Yeah,

528
00:31:19.601 --> 00:31:24.480
next year. Yeah. I will probably be eight and eight again because a, I've,

529
00:31:24.481 --> 00:31:28.780
I've accepted that this is the way things are. Um,

530
00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:33.730
I know a lot of positive driven people and they're not angry people.

531
00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:37.960
So I don't think being positive as part of that. I think it's,

532
00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:40.990
I think it's just how my fucking wires,

533
00:31:40.991 --> 00:31:43.030
my mental wires have been soldered together.

534
00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:48.260
I think I probably came into the world, I dunno.

535
00:31:48.410 --> 00:31:49.970
Can you come into the world angry?

536
00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:51.723
<v 2>Okay.</v>

537
00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:54.720
<v 0>I Dunno. I don't think he can. I don't think you're born that fucking way.</v>

538
00:31:54.721 --> 00:31:56.060
I have no fucking idea, but I don't,

539
00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:59.250
I dunno about this video where I got to now just, I just,

540
00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:02.490
the solution is just to be like, yeah, well you know,

541
00:32:02.491 --> 00:32:07.430
people out here when they make lives, that's how they're going to do it. I mean,

542
00:32:07.431 --> 00:32:09.680
I guess if you just do that, then you don't get angry.

543
00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:14.860
Cause all these years in me getting angry has not made people stop doing that.

544
00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:18.980
It never made the person in front of me go like, oh I'm sorry, let me get over.

545
00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:24.530
They just sort of look at me weird as I, as I drive by yelling at them,

546
00:32:24.531 --> 00:32:27.320
looking at me like, what the fuck is he yelling at me?

547
00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:31.100
Am I doing something I have no, I have a white car.

548
00:32:31.101 --> 00:32:34.790
How could I possibly be in the wrong? Um,

549
00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:38.480
I dunno. I have no idea. I think a,

550
00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:44.610
I dunno, I don't know what my deal is,

551
00:32:44.611 --> 00:32:46.710
but I plan on getting to the bottom but at least understand it.

552
00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:51.740
But I don't think a three minute fucking youtube video with some guy with his

553
00:32:52.021 --> 00:32:53.190
fucking, you know,

554
00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:57.090
I think in the United States we like getting like people with English accents to

555
00:32:57.091 --> 00:33:00.570
fucking narrate shit cause that it just sounds like it's true. Are Smart,

556
00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:02.850
you know what I mean? Which is why I think all these, uh,

557
00:33:02.851 --> 00:33:06.510
these English guys have been Scottish guys have done wealth. Um,

558
00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:10.470
maybe it's just women like fucking that accent or just like a different foreign

559
00:33:10.471 --> 00:33:13.770
accent. I don't know, like these talk show people, you know,

560
00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:16.950
for some reason that slot that used to be after David Letterman,

561
00:33:16.951 --> 00:33:20.180
you have to get an English or a Scottish guy. Like,

562
00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:23.010
that's become like that time slot, like an American accent.

563
00:33:23.011 --> 00:33:26.580
That guy can not do well in that.

564
00:33:27.150 --> 00:33:31.890
That is the Great Britain accent time slot.

565
00:33:33.450 --> 00:33:37.860
Um, I dunno, I, I, but I, I all I know is, I can't,

566
00:33:37.861 --> 00:33:41.220
I can't listen to fucking, I can't listen to this again. He's a friend.

567
00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:45.150
He's furious. He's been married to is,

568
00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:49.320
he's often furious. He sounds like he's in the fucking clockwork orange.

569
00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:53.340
Um, but I am off often furious. His name was Fred.

570
00:33:54.270 --> 00:33:58.920
I knew it was one of my names. Right. Um, all right, what am I doing here?

571
00:33:58.921 --> 00:34:01.320
Let's, let's, let's read some fucking advertising here.

572
00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:04.870
34 fucking minutes into this podcast and I don't think I'm,

573
00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:08.490
I don't think I'm even remotely a better person. What about you guys? Um,

574
00:34:10.010 --> 00:34:13.680
alright. Oh, it's our friends here. No, wait, let's, let's,

575
00:34:13.681 --> 00:34:15.800
let's stay on this point here. Maybe. Maybe that's what I should,

576
00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:16.830
I'm going to try that today.

577
00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:21.780
I'm going to just try walking around and what I'm gonna do is have my eyebrows

578
00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:25.980
up a little bit. I'm going to do that thing that, uh, people do.

579
00:34:25.981 --> 00:34:27.690
You know where they make their lips disappear,

580
00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:30.520
their mouth looks like it's closed, but their lips disappearing on the car.

581
00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:33.510
I'm just going to do that. Walk around like, Oh yeah,

582
00:34:34.830 --> 00:34:36.810
of course this thing that should take 90 seconds.

583
00:34:36.811 --> 00:34:41.040
Of course now it's going to take six minutes. Yup. Okay.

584
00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:46.470
Take my car over to the dealership to get the a, the brake light done. I mean,

585
00:34:46.471 --> 00:34:50.910
I know that I could change out a break lake, but of course you've uh,

586
00:34:50.911 --> 00:34:55.020
have the screws, they are there inside the car behind a plastic thing.

587
00:34:55.021 --> 00:34:59.070
And I know when I go to take that thing off that they are the head on the screw

588
00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:03.420
is going to be something I've never seen before and requests and requires a

589
00:35:03.421 --> 00:35:08.421
special screwdriver that I could go down or maybe order on Amazon.

590
00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:11.490
Do you know when? Of course they won't just sell me the one,

591
00:35:11.491 --> 00:35:14.250
I'll have to buy the whole set and then I'll be like, well,

592
00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:19.400
I guess I can pay fucking $35 for a new set of screwdrivers and hope I don't get

593
00:35:19.651 --> 00:35:21.630
a ticket over the next few fucking days.

594
00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:26.870
Or I could just drive down to this fucking dealership and just pay 180 bucks for

595
00:35:27.661 --> 00:35:29.490
a fucking like, oh, look at married, get mad again.

596
00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:31.123
<v 7>Okay,</v>

597
00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:35.700
<v 0>I'm just going to go down to the dealership and just say, yes,</v>

598
00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:39.570
I have something I could totally repair on my car.

599
00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:42.840
If you guys hadn't put those alien screws in there,

600
00:35:44.930 --> 00:35:45.680
excuse me,

601
00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:50.600
could I have the screwdriver that I need to undo those four screws?

602
00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:52.880
Could I, could I have that please?

603
00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:58.150
And could I then find the corporate guy right as he's getting on his jet who

604
00:35:58.461 --> 00:36:01.850
came up with this idea and could I please just, I don't know,

605
00:36:01.851 --> 00:36:06.500
just sort of stick it into the side of his neck. I think that would be nice.

606
00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:10.310
How does that work? If I say angry shit, but I say it in a pleasant way.

607
00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:13.110
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

608
00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:13.411
<v 0>ma'am.</v>

609
00:36:13.411 --> 00:36:18.411
Is there a reason why you're so not focused as you work this cash register?

610
00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:24.020
Is there a reason why you feel that you above a job that you stink at?

611
00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:25.730
How does that work?

612
00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.900
Shouldn't you be so good at this job that I'm actually sitting there thinking to

613
00:36:29.901 --> 00:36:33.830
myself, why are you working here? You're way beyond this.

614
00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:38.180
Why are you standing here reinforcing that you're not even good enough to do

615
00:36:38.181 --> 00:36:40.700
this job because you think you're better than another job.

616
00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:45.550
Is there any way you could open that cash register door and I could grab you by

617
00:36:45.551 --> 00:36:46.384
your ponytail,

618
00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:50.920
shove your head into the drawer and then see how far I could close it with your

619
00:36:50.921 --> 00:36:53.800
head in it. Is there a way I could do that?

620
00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:56.800
Sorry guys, you just don't,

621
00:36:56.840 --> 00:37:00.800
I have to rehearse everything then I'm going to go through today. Oh,

622
00:37:00.801 --> 00:37:05.150
hello staples. Um, no you cannot. You cannot have my phone number. I mean,

623
00:37:05.151 --> 00:37:09.920
I'll give you a phone number and I will give you an alternate phone number. Yes,

624
00:37:09.921 --> 00:37:13.700
I will. None of these will be true. I'll, I'll, I'll give you a,

625
00:37:13.701 --> 00:37:18.230
I'll give you a, a, you know my fake email addresses that I give, it's,

626
00:37:18.231 --> 00:37:20.780
you know it@alaol.com.

627
00:37:25.070 --> 00:37:29.090
You got to have a fake one. You know it@aol.com.

628
00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:35.270
That's my fake one. And that is a reference to willow feral in old school.

629
00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:39.740
Frank the tank when they go on fractal tank, right? He's gone. You know,

630
00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:47.060
um, the fake phone number I give out is a series of area codes followed by the

631
00:37:47.061 --> 00:37:51.960
number of five. They'll be like, what's your, uh,

632
00:37:51.961 --> 00:37:56.280
what's your phone number? It's like a three, two, three, two one,

633
00:37:56.281 --> 00:38:01.170
two eight one eight five. That's what I do.

634
00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:04.230
But they start to look at you after two area coats.

635
00:38:04.231 --> 00:38:07.980
You know when you go like three one oh two, one two. They get that.

636
00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:10.200
You get that little puppy look, that little cock in their head.

637
00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:12.300
And then rather than saying eight, one eight,

638
00:38:12.450 --> 00:38:16.080
cause they're gonna know I go eight one, eight, five.

639
00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:21.270
So I still get it in there. A fake name I go with all the time.

640
00:38:21.271 --> 00:38:26.250
Russell Russell, whenever I just need a first name. What's your name? Hey,

641
00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:29.400
what's your name? Russell. Russell. What can I do for you today? Well, you can,

642
00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:32.730
you can start by not asking me personal questions. All right,

643
00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:34.950
that's what you can do. And you can get some loafers.

644
00:38:35.370 --> 00:38:39.100
Aren't that fit your fucking feet. How about that? All right. That tight shoes.

645
00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:44.950
Um, I'm sorry. I don't know what to tell you. Oh, by the way,

646
00:38:44.951 --> 00:38:49.510
I, uh, you know, I got some video,

647
00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:53.620
my old buddy cleo and um,

648
00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:58.300
she seems happy as hell and this is unprecedented.

649
00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:03.360
This person that I gave my dog to is a dog trainer and um,

650
00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:09.160
at like the fucking dog whisperer level. So, which is what my dog needed.

651
00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:12.010
And he sent me video of something I've never seen before.

652
00:39:12.011 --> 00:39:16.180
My dog came in and wanted to play with another dog,

653
00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:19.420
which my dog never did. My dog tried to kill her, the dogs.

654
00:39:20.170 --> 00:39:24.320
My dog tried to kill another dog when my dog was with the trainer that now has

655
00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:27.720
it a slowly been working with this fucking thing and um,

656
00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:32.170
it was amazing. And the trainer said, you know,

657
00:39:32.171 --> 00:39:36.280
within a week to 10 days they will probably be just like best of friends

658
00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:38.110
sleeping together in the sun.

659
00:39:38.110 --> 00:39:41.740
So that made me feel good cause I think she's actually happier.

660
00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:47.020
Um, and that environment than she was with me, even though, you know,

661
00:39:47.350 --> 00:39:50.470
I miss her to death or what, but that made me feel good. So there you go.

662
00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:54.610
There you go. I'll tell you that fucking dog has had an amazing life,

663
00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:57.400
an amazing life. Like, uh,

664
00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:01.750
literally it should've been over like three different times and it always

665
00:40:01.751 --> 00:40:06.520
survives and its life has gotten progressively better. So, uh,

666
00:40:07.230 --> 00:40:11.090
they made me feel good as much as I, uh, as much as I missed the thing. Um,

667
00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:15.390
that's cool. It's got a Fred and I got nobody.

668

today. I have no fucking idea what any of that is.

728
00:44:03.511 --> 00:44:08.100
I don't know what just happened there. The origins,

729
00:44:08.101 --> 00:44:08.970
like the first

730
00:44:10.310 --> 00:44:11.480
<v 2>comic book,</v>

731
00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:15.300
<v 0>Do you need to explore the origins of teenage mutant Ninja Turtles? It's,</v>

732
00:44:15.301 --> 00:44:18.010
it's all on the Internet. Superman.

733
00:44:18.090 --> 00:44:20.010
That goes back to the 30s there was no internet back then.

734
00:44:20.011 --> 00:44:24.070
The Internet came out in the late sixties right when Al Gore was in his fucking

735
00:44:24.450 --> 00:44:27.690
i's dorm room. Right. He was in there with Donald Trump and they are,

736
00:44:27.691 --> 00:44:28.830
they both came up with it.

737
00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:34.660
They should both host a game show called a what I invented de. No,

738
00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:37.260
it's like to tell the truth and you got to guess, right? Just the two of them.

739
00:44:37.261 --> 00:44:41.520
Just sit there talking shit, you know. All right. I'm sorry. Dollar Shave Club.

745
00:44:57.540 --> 00:45:00.060

746
00:45:00.061 --> 00:45:03.330
you need to, you need to take a shave. Hey, why don't you take a shave,

All right. Turns out dollar Shave Club. Thought of that thought of what?

749
00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:17.400
Taking a shave. Oh, buying a oh shower shit. Alright.

750
00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:19.830
They just came out with a new line of shower products.

751
00:45:19.831 --> 00:45:22.140

There are a lot of body washes out there that make you smell like a teenager.

756
00:45:38.070 --> 00:45:42.060
This mint and Cedar Wood Body Wash is amazing and makes you smell incredible.

757
00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:45.660
How is that natural to walk around smelling like ice cream and like you just

758
00:45:45.950 --> 00:45:50.640
chopped some lumber? It makes no fucking sense to me whatsoever.

759
00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:55.200
You know what I mean? I know meant in Cedar would exist, exist in nature.

760
00:45:56.670 --> 00:45:59.760
I don't know. You got to give it a try. Uh,

I know an easy way to do that.

00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:53.350
I'm gonna read this like a creepy cold leader trying to get your money and

775
00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:55.210
gradually bring into the fold.

776
00:46:56.110 --> 00:46:59.740
I know an easy way to do that with stamps.com.

777
00:47:00.970 --> 00:47:04.090
Think about how much time you've wasted,

778
00:47:05.020 --> 00:47:09.490
how much time you've wasted going to the post office,

779
00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:12.760
driving there, finding parking,

780
00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:16.870
spending your own money on things that you want to spend it on.

781
00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:23.160
I think it's time he came into my compound and started spending your money on me

782
00:47:23.890 --> 00:47:26.980
because I am truly the son of God.

783
00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:32.110
Not only that, stamps.com is the better way to get postage.

784
00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:34.570
Just use what you already have.

785
00:47:35.610 --> 00:47:40.030
You don't need to go cause you're already there. Your computer and printer, t,

786
00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:43.500
t, I. N what the Fuck? I'm sorry. Just use whatever you have. All right,

787
00:47:43.501 --> 00:47:45.130

788
00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:47.460

789
00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:50.460
Then the mailman picks it up with stamps.com everything you would do with the

790
00:47:50.461 --> 00:47:52.860
post office you write from your desk and at a fraction of the cost,

791
00:47:52.861 --> 00:47:54.240

801
00:48:30.390 --> 00:48:33.720
Sorry. Red The anger one goodwill.

802
00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:38.520
Hey Bill. Bill podcast. Can't wait for F.

803
00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:40.590
F is for family seasoned too. Thank you very much.

804
00:48:40.591 --> 00:48:44.070
Last week on the Thursday podcast, you talked about goodwill.

805
00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:48.300
I worked at goodwill for a little over a year and you wouldn't believe this shit

806
00:48:48.301 --> 00:48:51.270
that was donated there. Oh my God. This fascinates the hell out of me.

807
00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:54.600
I imagine they give you basically everything short of a body.

808
00:48:56.550 --> 00:49:00.570
Um, you are totally right. Uh, they just throw all this shit and trucks,

809
00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:05.190
but they, but instead of throwing shit in the oceans,

810
00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:09.310
yeah, wait a second. But they, instead of throwing shit in the oceans,

811
00:49:09.311 --> 00:49:14.311
put the trucks in warehouses and let them set for at least three to 10 years so

812
00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:18.220
the shit can get a lovely set of molds over them.

813
00:49:19.180 --> 00:49:22.360
When they get loaded, they literally throw this shit on the truck.

814
00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:26.920
Nine times out of 10 braking, whatever you are donating.

815
00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:30.670
No Way. You know what the Shit,

816
00:49:30.730 --> 00:49:33.430
you know what the shit thing is about donating to goodwill?

817
00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:35.810
You can break shit with mold, piss,

818
00:49:35.811 --> 00:49:39.340
shit or anything else disgusting there and they have to take it.

819
00:49:39.341 --> 00:49:40.960
Well then what are they supposed to do with it?

820
00:49:40.961 --> 00:49:45.961
I'd put it on a truck to nine times out of 10 they will take anything but that

821
00:49:46.121 --> 00:49:50.350
one time out of 10 if you bitch and threatened to call corporate and complain,

822
00:49:50.530 --> 00:49:54.550
they will take no matter they'll take it no matter what. Nope.

823
00:49:55.100 --> 00:49:57.710
Somebody's got to do a documentary on goodwill. When I was there,

824
00:49:57.711 --> 00:50:02.150
people would donate trash. They didn't want to pay to get rid of couches,

825
00:50:02.151 --> 00:50:05.030
torn to shit with piss stains all over it.

826
00:50:05.031 --> 00:50:10.031
Mattresses with literal shit on them and a laundry list of low of long gross

827
00:50:11.871 --> 00:50:16.310
shit. Dude, this is like an Expo Zay and I'm taking this all is fact.

828
00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:20.630
I have no idea if this is true or not. They will literally sell anything.

829
00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:25.130
I got to the point that when people would donate things that were really nice,

830
00:50:25.131 --> 00:50:28.940
I would tell them they should keep it or it to someone because it would just be

831
00:50:28.941 --> 00:50:29.870
thrown away.

832
00:50:30.110 --> 00:50:33.980
But of course the mouth breathing assholes that would donate trash that they,

833
00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:36.510
that they have to what,

834
00:50:36.590 --> 00:50:40.850
but of course the maltreating assholes that would donate trash that they have to

835
00:50:40.851 --> 00:50:42.950
take. Dude, you're a bit of a mouth breather here.

836
00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:46.070
You're not speaking in full sentences. Uh,

837
00:50:46.071 --> 00:50:51.071
these people are hoarders that you can't even open their car door without shit

838
00:50:51.171 --> 00:50:53.780
falling all over the fucking place. Fucking discussing.

839
00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:58.960
The grossest thing that I ever saw get sold was either a mattress with shit and

840
00:50:59.541 --> 00:51:00.530
piss stains on it,

841
00:51:01.070 --> 00:51:05.600
or an antique dildo that had white hair all over it.

842
00:51:06.290 --> 00:51:10.540
Ah, ah. Come on. Come on. Come on people. I can't believe this. This, this. I'm,

843
00:51:10.541 --> 00:51:13.970
am I getting trolled here? Is this a millennial? Is he giving me the business?

844
00:51:14.810 --> 00:51:15.081
He says,

845
00:51:15.081 --> 00:51:19.980
I know this is going to sound like I am making myself in this situation.

846
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:25.000
What I know this is going to sound like I am making myself in this situation.

847
00:51:25.041 --> 00:51:28.010
The good guy is this a voice text.

848
00:51:28.850 --> 00:51:31.340
But I seriously would look at them and be like,

849
00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:35.450
why the fuck are we selling this? This is really wrong. They will respond with,

850
00:51:35.451 --> 00:51:38.300
we have to sell everything to try and make bonus.

851
00:51:38.510 --> 00:51:41.150
The sad thing was we never made bonus.

852
00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:44.300
I got to the point where I wouldn't press shit because it was garbage.

853
00:51:44.610 --> 00:51:47.660
And my last day I felt like grabbing a trash bag from the office,

854
00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:51.380
go around the building, picking up trash, then tying it, tie it up,

855
00:51:51.620 --> 00:51:56.620
slap a dollar on it and write on the bag mystery bag or some shit like that and

856
00:51:57.471 --> 00:52:00.980
see if anybody would buy it. But I didn't do, this is all,

857
00:52:00.981 --> 00:52:04.670
that was all one sentence on my last day.

858
00:52:04.671 --> 00:52:07.820
I felt like grabbing a trash bag from the office, go around the building,

859
00:52:07.821 --> 00:52:10.100
picking up trash, then tie it up,

860
00:52:10.101 --> 00:52:15.101
slap a dollar on it and write on the bag mystery bag or some shit like that and

861
00:52:15.651 --> 00:52:20.150
see if someone would buy it. But I didn't. Oh one sentence.

862
00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:23.690
Thanks bill for the labs and good luck to you and Nia with the new baby. Um,

863
00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:25.090
yeah, I kinda, I kinda get it,

864
00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:28.580
but people just use goodwill cause they want to feel like they're being

865
00:52:28.610 --> 00:52:33.230
environmentally conscious. You know, I'm not throwing this out.

866
00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:36.410
It's going to end up in a landfill or in the ocean and then you just bring it

867
00:52:36.411 --> 00:52:41.330
down there and they just throw it out. Yeah. Well it didn't take a genius.

868
00:52:41.450 --> 00:52:45.380
You come down and there's a giant fucking 18 wheeler empty just parked there

869
00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:48.710
now. Like it's dropping off or picking up shit. It's shit. It's there on,

870
00:52:48.980 --> 00:52:52.130
it's on his legs. There's no a tractor trailer there and you know,

871
00:52:52.250 --> 00:52:54.680
they just come over there like once a day and just drive that thing away.

872
00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:57.740
Where's it going? Alright.

873
00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:02.420
Drama Queen Dad a dear Billy red nose. First off,

874
00:53:02.421 --> 00:53:05.780
I'd like to say thanks for man. Thank you. Thank you. I'm a lady. Oh my God.

875
00:53:05.781 --> 00:53:09.200
I have a female Finn in high school and lately I've been listening to your

876
00:53:09.201 --> 00:53:13.520
podcast whenever I'm stressed out or just looking for something to laugh at.

877
00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:15.650
Okay. Now onto the story.

878
00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:20.680
My father is a middle aged man with bipolar disorder and likes to blame

879
00:53:22.131 --> 00:53:24.470
everything on his mental illnesses. He calls it.

880
00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:26.670
I like that you're already taking them to task here.

881
00:53:26.671 --> 00:53:29.420
He's going to blame everything on his mental illness. Yeah.

882
00:53:29.610 --> 00:53:32.790
That's no reason to not do your dishes. All right. All right. They'll loopy.

883
00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:37.590
He's very dramatic and claims that his bipolar is the reason he hasn't been able

884
00:53:37.591 --> 00:53:38.970
to hold a job lately,

885
00:53:39.180 --> 00:53:42.840
even though he kept the same career for about 10 years and is now working for a

886
00:53:42.841 --> 00:53:44.730
new company by parents are divorced.

887
00:53:44.731 --> 00:53:46.890
So whenever my father can't have us over to visit,

888
00:53:46.891 --> 00:53:50.520
he claims it's because of his illness. Ah, man. That's the greatest.

889
00:53:50.550 --> 00:53:52.830
That there's nothing like a fucking builtin excuse.

890
00:53:53.580 --> 00:53:57.360
That's gonna be great when I have a kid here in a few fucking days, minutes,

891
00:53:57.360 --> 00:54:01.740
weeks, whatever. Um, ah, you know, I'd love to, but my kid, my kid's, uh, yeah,

892
00:54:01.741 --> 00:54:03.690
I can, I got a kid. Um,

893
00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:08.190
I don't want to tell him him that bipolar disorder is not a mental illness

894
00:54:08.191 --> 00:54:12.180
because he, he'd go ape shit on him. Um,

895
00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:16.740
his bipolar, I don't know. I thought anytime your brain was fucked up,

896
00:54:16.741 --> 00:54:21.270
you had a mental illness. I have a mental limbless with my anger. Okay.

897
00:54:21.271 --> 00:54:22.680
Bipolar.

898
00:54:26.660 --> 00:54:28.640
Bipolar. Is it a

899
00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:30.233
<v 8>okay</v>

900
00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:35.100
<v 0>disease? Oh, let's see here. Oh,</v>

901
00:54:35.101 --> 00:54:36.630
just give me the fucking answer.

902
00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:41.310
Oh, Jesus.

903
00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:45.830
Oh fuck you. I'm not reading all this shit.

904
00:54:46.670 --> 00:54:46.940
<v 8>Yeah,</v>

905
00:54:46.940 --> 00:54:51.470
<v 0>this is the Internet. I don't want to expound it on. Just give me the yes or no.</v>

906
00:54:52.130 --> 00:54:56.130
Is there a yes or no.com? Can you just do that? Just answer a fiasco. Fucking,

907
00:54:56.220 --> 00:54:57.770
it's like, I don't want to know why

908
00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:04.090
is this blah, blah, blah, yes or no. And then you have your answers.

909
00:55:04.091 --> 00:55:06.710
So then when you go to the bar and somebody says something you like, no,

910
00:55:06.711 --> 00:55:10.280
it is our, yes, it is Yarra. It is.

911
00:55:11.070 --> 00:55:14.780
Do you know that bipolar disorder develops during a person's late teens or early

912
00:55:14.781 --> 00:55:16.700
adult years? Do you know? I didn't ask that question.

913
00:55:17.690 --> 00:55:19.910
Never trust a fucking doctor with a goatee.

914
00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:21.073
<v 8>Yeah.</v>

915
00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:25.530
<v 0>Where the fuck is it? A, you know. Oh my God. Jesus Christ.</v>

916
00:55:27.550 --> 00:55:30.010
Look at these fucking eggheads here. I'll get a nice full heads of hair though.

917
00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:34.960
I've got to give them that. All right. Anyways, um,

918
00:55:35.230 --> 00:55:38.380
I don't want to tell them bipolar disorder is not a mental illness because he'll

919
00:55:38.381 --> 00:55:39.880
go ape shit on me for some reason.

920
00:55:39.881 --> 00:55:43.990
He seems to enjoy making me my sister feel like shit and makes mountains out of

921
00:55:43.991 --> 00:55:48.580
molehills whenever we correct him or stand up for ourselves when he bullies us.

922
00:55:48.610 --> 00:55:50.410
Yeah. I don't take any shift. He sounds like an asshole.

923
00:55:50.710 --> 00:55:54.070
What's even worse about this is that his bullying always works.

924
00:55:54.190 --> 00:55:58.420
He's very manipulative and I'm scared to see him because of the things he said

925
00:55:58.421 --> 00:56:00.920
and done to me in the past. Every time I'm,

926
00:56:01.090 --> 00:56:05.340
I'm informed I'll have to spend the weekend with him. Um,

927
00:56:05.470 --> 00:56:08.320
I nearly piss myself with anxiety. My question to you is,

928
00:56:08.321 --> 00:56:10.300
how the fuck do you deal with someone like this?

929
00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:13.540
I know my dad is ridiculous and uses underhanded tactics,

930
00:56:13.690 --> 00:56:15.490
tactics to make me feel like shit,

931
00:56:15.670 --> 00:56:18.040
but for some reason I'm not able to just get over it.

932
00:56:18.250 --> 00:56:21.850
None of my friends seem to relate to being so terrified of one person.

933
00:56:21.851 --> 00:56:24.760
Like I am of my father and I'd like to hear your take on things.

934
00:56:24.761 --> 00:56:27.970
Thanks for reading this and go fuck yourself. Um,

935
00:56:29.490 --> 00:56:30.323
<v 2>yeah.</v>

936
00:56:30.410 --> 00:56:33.140
<v 0>All right. How would I get past it? Well, this is the hardest thing to do.</v>

937
00:56:33.141 --> 00:56:38.141
You have to stop giving a shit about the guy to a certain level at some point.

938
00:56:39.411 --> 00:56:41.420
You know, when you, if you have a parent like this,

939
00:56:41.450 --> 00:56:46.450
you have to look at them and remove mentally that they're a relative and you

940
00:56:47.661 --> 00:56:51.680
have to just say to yourself, like, if this person was a complete stranger,

941
00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:57.230
would I be friends with this person? Would I interact with this person?

942
00:56:57.231 --> 00:57:01.970
Would I waste another minute, my fucking life dealing with this person?

943
00:57:03.110 --> 00:57:05.540
You know? And when you got to ask those questions, usually it's like,

944
00:57:05.570 --> 00:57:09.500
absolutely not. This would have been a fucking one and done situation.

945
00:57:09.501 --> 00:57:12.500
But the thing is, is is your dad, she can't write them off,

946
00:57:12.501 --> 00:57:13.610
but you have to kind of,

947
00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:17.270
that's the toughest thing when you've got to write off a parent but still

948
00:57:17.271 --> 00:57:20.960
interact with them. You just gotta be like, I don't know.

949
00:57:20.990 --> 00:57:25.080
You kind of have to find the humor in it. I think that's a tough one. Um,

950
00:57:25.180 --> 00:57:26.420
especially at your age.

951
00:57:28.110 --> 00:57:28.943
<v 2>Um,</v>

952
00:57:31.300 --> 00:57:32.290
<v 0>I dunno, I would just,</v>

953
00:57:32.291 --> 00:57:35.110
I don't know that I would probably could do some passive aggressive shit where I

954
00:57:35.111 --> 00:57:38.140
would just say grow. Yeah. Is that how it is? Okay, I'll get right on that.

955
00:57:38.141 --> 00:57:41.050
You know, Shit like that. I don't know what to tell you. I would just basically,

956
00:57:41.450 --> 00:57:42.283
um,

957
00:57:42.390 --> 00:57:43.223
<v 2>okay.</v>

958
00:57:45.730 --> 00:57:48.620
<v 0>I would still like, what is he going to do other than get mad? He does.</v>

959
00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:50.200
It doesn't sound like he hits you or anything.

960
00:57:50.201 --> 00:57:55.201
So he just mad and he flips out or whatever and just I stop.

961
00:57:55.630 --> 00:57:57.340
Who gives a fuck? That's what he's going to do.

962
00:57:57.970 --> 00:58:01.150
The guy's out of his fucking mind, right? Maybe he's got bipolar,

963
00:58:01.420 --> 00:58:05.080
maybe it doesn't. Maybe it's a disease. Maybe it isn't all, you know, they just,

964
00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:10.380
Oh man, this is tough. This is, it's fun. This is a fucking rough one.

965
00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:15.060
Cause it's your dad and the last thing you want to do is then go out in the

966
00:58:15.061 --> 00:58:18.420
world and start dating somebody who then treats you like ditch that,

967
00:58:18.990 --> 00:58:20.820
the exact fucking thing you don't want.

968
00:58:20.821 --> 00:58:24.090
And then you end up with that and then you have that same nervousness in a

969
00:58:24.091 --> 00:58:26.580
fucking relationship. That's all I can say. You know what you got to do?

970
00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:28.740
You're not going to be able to fix this guy.

971
00:58:28.890 --> 00:58:31.860
You gotta deal with them because he is your dad. Um,

972
00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:37.400
but the big thing that you could do is in your life is you create a life that

973
00:58:37.801 --> 00:58:40.800
does not involve this. All right?

974
00:58:40.801 --> 00:58:43.110
You need to go out and go marry a fucking suit,

975
00:58:44.730 --> 00:58:45.563
<v 2>right?</v>

976
00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:50.410
<v 0>And then your fucking house is great and it's peaceful and it's what you want.</v>

977
00:58:50.490 --> 00:58:55.210
And then every once in a while this fucking tornado tornado blows through and

978
00:58:55.211 --> 00:59:00.211
you deal with it and then it leaves and then you go back to your peaceful life.

979
00:59:01.120 --> 00:59:02.770
Um, that's all you can do. You really, as a kid,

980
00:59:02.771 --> 00:59:05.230
you really can't do anything about your parents. You can't pick them.

981
00:59:05.290 --> 00:59:07.090
You just get the ones that you get. But, uh,

982
00:59:07.091 --> 00:59:10.300
the thing that you can do is create a life that does not involve that.

983
00:59:10.301 --> 00:59:13.150
And then you don't do that shit to your kids. And then you break the cycle,

984
00:59:13.510 --> 00:59:16.950
then that's it. You know? But the weird fucking thing is, is that your,

985
00:59:17.290 --> 00:59:20.950
your decks still always going to be in your life, you know,

986
00:59:21.020 --> 00:59:24.110
so that lunatic will then be around your kids and it's just, it's a,

987
00:59:24.111 --> 00:59:26.180
it's a motherfucker he really is,

988
00:59:26.780 --> 00:59:31.400
but unfortunately they for the most part die before we do. And then, you know,

989
00:59:31.730 --> 00:59:33.020
you don't have to deal with them anymore.

990
00:59:33.021 --> 00:59:35.270
So I guess try to find the fucking humor in it

991
00:59:36.830 --> 00:59:40.810
while you're dealing with it and then think of how exciting your life is going

992
00:59:40.811 --> 00:59:45.530
to be. Um, by not having that in it. You know,

993
00:59:46.850 --> 00:59:48.590
you might want to just Skype with them for awhile,

994
00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:55.280
get yourself in a situation and be like, what? I think the screen froze hello.

995
00:59:55.410 --> 00:59:59.150
And you just click. Um, but that's really a,

996
00:59:59.151 --> 01:00:03.830
that's disappointing to hear that an adult would manipulate a teenager,

997
01:00:03.831 --> 01:00:08.330
forget about his own fucking daughter. That's sucked. So I don't try that,

998
01:00:08.331 --> 01:00:11.450
but just know that you can go out in the world and have any life that you want

999
01:00:11.451 --> 01:00:15.350
to have, uh, simply by, you know, you know,

1000
01:00:15.390 --> 01:00:18.930
he's showing you what you don't want. All right. There you go. Oh man,

1001
01:00:18.931 --> 01:00:19.764
that's brutal.

1002
01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:23.490
You fuck you fuck up so bad as a parent that your daughter goes out going,

1003
01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:27.060
I want to marry a man who is the exact opposite of my own dad. Poof.

1004
01:00:27.570 --> 01:00:30.750
That's game set. Match. You fucked up as a father. All right. Sisters,

1005
01:00:30.751 --> 01:00:35.730
girlfriend, dear bill, the red bitch birth. Uh,

1006
01:00:35.731 --> 01:00:40.731
my twin sister is a lesbian and she's dating the lady who was bisexual.

1007
01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:45.800
She was bisexual. And then what?

1008
01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:47.553
<v 8>Okay.</v>

1009
01:00:48.170 --> 01:00:51.860
<v 0>Then what became totally homosexual and went back to heterosexuality or is she</v>

1010
01:00:51.861 --> 01:00:54.950
asexual? At first we didn't, we weren't close or anything,

1011
01:00:54.951 --> 01:00:59.630
but we did get along with your twin sister, not the bisexual woman. Right.

1012
01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:03.950
Then about a year ago, we ran into each other at a club in the and Oh,

1013
01:01:03.951 --> 01:01:05.420
I know you're talking about the bisexuality.

1014
01:01:05.450 --> 01:01:09.170
My sister is a lesbian and she was dating a lady who was bisexual first.

1015
01:01:09.171 --> 01:01:10.420
We weren't close or anything but,

1016
01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:13.730
but we got along and I'm assuming you're talking about the bisexual lady then

1017
01:01:13.731 --> 01:01:18.450
about a year ago we ran into each other and at downtown club, uh, we,

1018
01:01:18.451 --> 01:01:21.350
we had a few drought. Jesus, we have a few drinks.

1019
01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:25.340
Just start talking about random stuff. Uh, she came back,

1020
01:01:25.341 --> 01:01:26.450
she's going to try to fucking,

1021
01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:31.280
she can try to finger bang the whole family here until a friend of mine invited

1022
01:01:31.281 --> 01:01:34.760
us to a party at some guy's house. We went and had a lot more to drink.

1023
01:01:34.761 --> 01:01:36.880
And then one thing led to another.

1024
01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:41.480
W what does anything good ever come after? And then, you know,

1025
01:01:41.481 --> 01:01:45.030
one thing led to another. That's when you're fast forwarding through some,

1026
01:01:45.090 --> 01:01:47.720
a piece of shit thing you did or something you're embarrassed of, hey, you know,

1027
01:01:47.721 --> 01:01:51.950
one thing led to another. No one ever talks about fucking a, hey,

1028
01:01:51.951 --> 01:01:54.170
how did you hit that? When that winning game shot? Well,

1029
01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:58.220
they inbounded the ball and now one thing led to another and uh, you know,

1030
01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:00.950
I hit the, I hit the shot to win the championship.

1031
01:02:00.951 --> 01:02:05.951
You will tell every fucking detail I was riding down the court with every step.

1032
01:02:06.771 --> 01:02:10.400
I can feel my IP. I knew somebody had to step up, let me do this.

1033
01:02:10.401 --> 01:02:13.640
I'm always going to be me. Right? That's how you tell it when you fucking,

1034
01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:17.360
when you did some good shit, you did some bad shit. Yeah.

1035
01:02:17.361 --> 01:02:19.560
One thing led to another and uh,

1036
01:02:19.590 --> 01:02:21.630
the guy was on the ground and he wasn't breathing.

1037
01:02:21.690 --> 01:02:26.490
So I don't know what happened. Okay. One thing led to another.

1038
01:02:26.491 --> 01:02:29.340
We ended up having sex. The next day we came,

1039
01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:33.090
we came to and both felt horrible about what happened.

1040
01:02:34.530 --> 01:02:39.030
You both came to, I just pictured that fucking, you know,

1041
01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:43.000
take my picture, smack my bitch up.

1042
01:02:43.250 --> 01:02:45.470
Remember that Madonna was in the background going on.

1043
01:02:46.060 --> 01:02:50.480
[inaudible] she was saying like the fucking opening to star Trek. Um,

1044
01:02:50.670 --> 01:02:54.450
the next day we came to in both felt horribly about what happened.

1045
01:02:54.451 --> 01:02:58.410
She then told my sister that she slept with a man,

1046
01:02:58.411 --> 01:03:02.790
but didn't tell her it was me. Oh, wait, you're a guy.

1047
01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:06.720
I thought this was a lady.

1048
01:03:08.690 --> 01:03:13.580
Oh, okay. Okay. I bisexual. I don't know. All right. Wait a minute.

1049
01:03:13.610 --> 01:03:16.220
Wait a minute. All right. Your twin sister is a lesbian.

1050
01:03:16.221 --> 01:03:19.480
She's dating the ladies bisexual, Yada, Yada.

1051
01:03:19.540 --> 01:03:23.120
At first you weren't close or anything, but we got along okay.

1052
01:03:23.121 --> 01:03:25.400
And then you ran into her and you fucked,

1053
01:03:25.820 --> 01:03:28.760
you fucked your fucking sisters

1054
01:03:31.410 --> 01:03:32.243
girlfriend.

1055
01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:36.480
No wonder you went with one thing led to another.

1056
01:03:37.830 --> 01:03:41.620
Then we came to like, you were both drugged. Ah,

1057
01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:45.540
these are classic. You feel horrible about this sir,

1058
01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:48.960
or you don't and uh, but you want to get away with it.

1059
01:03:49.090 --> 01:03:51.420
So you're blowing through the details. While this is very,

1060
01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:54.780
this is very underwritten for what the fuck is just gone down here.

1061
01:03:55.650 --> 01:03:57.420
Jesus Christ. Uh,

1062
01:03:57.510 --> 01:04:01.890
she then told my sister that she slept with a man but didn't tell her it was me

1063
01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:05.010
too. This chick is a psycho, uh,

1064
01:04:05.370 --> 01:04:07.590
for the past year I've been torn up about it.

1065
01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:09.840
I need your unbiased style of advice.

1066
01:04:09.841 --> 01:04:14.700
Should I tell my sister that was me or not? Thanks. Ps, come to blah,

1067
01:04:14.701 --> 01:04:18.930
blah, blah. I would love to see you again. Um, dude, no, don't say a few.

1068
01:04:19.290 --> 01:04:19.681
Die with that.

1069
01:04:19.681 --> 01:04:24.681
Secret that with that secret hope that woman fades away and then if shit ever

1070
01:04:24.691 --> 01:04:25.860
comes back around,

1071
01:04:26.940 --> 01:04:31.940
she said it was you and just be like it was the fire.

1072
01:04:33.490 --> 01:04:37.140
What time you wake up with Drake? Oh, one thing led to another.

1073
01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:42.120
I wouldn't say a fucking word.

1074
01:04:43.170 --> 01:04:43.750
<v 9>Okay.</v>

1075
01:04:43.750 --> 01:04:45.070
<v 0>Don't say a fucking word. Okay.</v>

1076
01:04:45.071 --> 01:04:47.780
The fly in the ointment here is his bisexual lady. Okay.

1077
01:04:47.781 --> 01:04:50.330
She's jumping all over the fence. She's fucking sister.

1078
01:04:50.331 --> 01:04:53.910
She's fucking brothers and she's fucking white people. No kidding.

1079
01:04:54.130 --> 01:04:58.120
She's fucking two people that she's, she's the fly in the fucking ointment.

1080
01:04:58.150 --> 01:05:01.990
Okay. She said this shit. Um, I don't know why she's doing that. This is like,

1081
01:05:01.991 --> 01:05:06.580
this is, she's like Glenn Close, um, in fatal attraction.

1082
01:05:06.581 --> 01:05:10.690
If she fucked both Michael Douglas in the Hottie was married to and the rabbit,

1083
01:05:10.750 --> 01:05:15.070
okay. She's fuck this lady. Just, you know, you just sit tight.

1084
01:05:15.670 --> 01:05:20.650
Okay. This is like in a sub and you cut the engines and you're just hoping that

1085
01:05:20.651 --> 01:05:22.480
they're not going to start dropping deaf charges.

1086
01:05:22.481 --> 01:05:26.050
You just hope you get through it sometimes in life. You just shut the fuck up.

1087
01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:29.320
I, this was one, I wouldn't say anything. Okay.

1088
01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:31.113
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1089
01:05:32.190 --> 01:05:34.890
<v 0>And if she brings it up, yeah, you slept with her. I would just, I mean,</v>

1090
01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:38.970
what are you going to do? This is the thing, you just,

1091
01:05:39.870 --> 01:05:41.460
this lady's out of her fucking mind.

1092
01:05:41.461 --> 01:05:44.250
There's no way your sister's going to end up with her, okay?

1093
01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:49.220
There is no way she's going to end up with her. All right?

1094
01:05:49.250 --> 01:05:52.100
This woman's out of her fucking mind. So she's eventually going to fade away.

1095
01:05:52.550 --> 01:05:56.780
All you have to do is just hope that when it comes time for the breakup,

1096
01:05:56.990 --> 01:05:59.480
that the crazy bitch is breaking up with your sister.

1097
01:05:59.690 --> 01:06:02.630
Because if your sister goes to break up with her in that highly emotional

1098
01:06:02.631 --> 01:06:06.500
moment, she might drop the ball, okay?

1099
01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:10.580
And then you would just, you just gotta play it. Like she said, what

1100
01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:16.240
now had never had. She's just like, well, you just breaking up that she said,

1101
01:06:16.241 --> 01:06:20.190
that's why she was saying it because you broke and that she walks to the room.

1102
01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:21.610
You're like, oh, all right. I did it

1103
01:06:22.380 --> 01:06:24.180
<v 4>because one thing led to another.</v>

1104
01:06:27.950 --> 01:06:31.040
<v 0>Alright, call my parents down a Billy blue lungs.</v>

1105
01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:33.380
I don't know what that means.

1106
01:06:33.950 --> 01:06:38.780
I'm 24 years old and I'm dating a woman that is 34 years old. Uh, all right.

1107
01:06:38.781 --> 01:06:42.170
See you fucking in all the lady. You're not dating. Come on. What do you do?

1108
01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:42.890
Oh wait,

1109
01:06:42.890 --> 01:06:46.190
what are you going to have your first kid with her when she's like 96 we've been

1110
01:06:46.191 --> 01:06:48.890
dating for close to three years now and I couldn't be happier.

1111
01:06:48.891 --> 01:06:53.450
We recently bought a house. So Gigi, you're 24.

1112
01:06:53.451 --> 01:06:56.600
You're dating a 34 year old and you bought a house with her recently bought a

1113
01:06:56.601 --> 01:06:58.850
house. I would be nervous if this was flipped in.

1114
01:06:58.851 --> 01:07:03.020
The guy was 34 and it was a 24 year old. He's still a wild horse man.

1115
01:07:03.110 --> 01:07:05.840
You got to run out in the range. Um,

1116
01:07:06.260 --> 01:07:10.100
we recently bought a house and finally came time to put down the down payment on

1117
01:07:10.101 --> 01:07:12.440
the house and all that extra stuff. I'm going to be honest,

1118
01:07:13.550 --> 01:07:15.590
that ego issues on the down payment,

1119
01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:18.560
she knows my financial status and she was cool with it,

1120
01:07:18.830 --> 01:07:22.190
but I just wanted to provide more because she does so much for me.

1121
01:07:22.730 --> 01:07:27.170
So I dropped my car insurance without her knowing to give her the extra money,

1122
01:07:27.171 --> 01:07:30.020
even though she said I didn't need to. I felt like,

1123
01:07:30.050 --> 01:07:34.820
what sort of man would I be if I didn't contribute my part? So my luck has it.

1124
01:07:35.060 --> 01:07:38.660
I got into a car accident literally two weeks after I dropped my car insurance.

1125
01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:42.130
I'm between a rock and a hard place. Now we want to start a family,

1126
01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:45.530
but I'm guessing my license would be suspended for a year.

1127
01:07:45.890 --> 01:07:48.770
A lot of burden will be put upon her now that I'm,

1128
01:07:49.130 --> 01:07:52.880
I'm assuming my license will be suspended for some time. Bill, any,

1129
01:07:52.881 --> 01:07:57.800
if you could do me a solid on this one, that would be great. Ps,

1130
01:07:58.250 --> 01:08:00.900
longtime listener, first time, email. Ah, Geez. What are you,

1131
01:08:00.901 --> 01:08:05.390
what are you asking me? Like, yeah, you're fucked. You are fucked.

1132
01:08:05.391 --> 01:08:08.640
I agree with that. Um,

1133
01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:14.460
well I um, in life sometimes you learn a hard lesson, sir,

1134
01:08:14.461 --> 01:08:17.290
and you learn in right now. I'm sorry, I don't know what to tell you. You

1135
01:08:18.830 --> 01:08:23.330
with this woman, I mean, the solution you,

1136
01:08:23.331 --> 01:08:26.330
what you learned is the solution is not doing what you did.

1137
01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:31.040
You don't expose yourself to that type of a liability.

1138
01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:32.593
Um,

1139
01:08:33.450 --> 01:08:34.283
<v 5>okay.</v>

1140
01:08:34.490 --> 01:08:39.380
<v 0>You didn't really ask me a question. Uh,</v>

1141
01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:42.110
all right. So you love this person. You, you want to start a family,

1142
01:08:42.111 --> 01:08:46.400
that's all good and you fucked up. Uh, I would, I guess if you haven't told her,

1143
01:08:46.401 --> 01:08:50.360
I would come clean. Tell her what you did, why you did it.

1144
01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:52.670
Say you're sorry. And uh,

1145
01:08:54.230 --> 01:08:57.830
and I don't what you, what's your, you're 24 and you want to be able to provide,

1146
01:08:58.310 --> 01:09:01.550
she's 34 and you're going to get married and you're going to start a family.

1147
01:09:01.551 --> 01:09:04.070
I don't know how you'd be able to provide, you've got to get your career going.

1148
01:09:04.071 --> 01:09:05.960
I would think so.

1149
01:09:05.961 --> 01:09:10.280
That would be my biggest concern once I find out what the judgement against me

1150
01:09:10.281 --> 01:09:13.640
is going to be. But uh, here's the deal dude.

1151
01:09:13.850 --> 01:09:16.880
She's 34 year 24. She should be making more money than you.

1152
01:09:16.990 --> 01:09:19.700
She should have more money than you. Her life should be further down there,

1153
01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:24.270
you know, uh, you can't try to catch up to a 34 year old. Alright.

1154
01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:26.720
Cause the only way for you to do it is to do what you just did.

1155
01:09:27.350 --> 01:09:30.590
And you ended up fucking yourself over. And in the long run,

1156
01:09:30.591 --> 01:09:33.140
you fuck her over too. So, um,

1157
01:09:34.310 --> 01:09:38.810
you have to respect the fact that you're the age you're at, you're at. And uh,

1158
01:09:39.980 --> 01:09:42.710
I would try to figure out what the fuck I wanted to do with my life and I would

1159
01:09:42.711 --> 01:09:46.370
try to get that career going and I would hope that there would be a bus close by

1160
01:09:46.371 --> 01:09:48.160
that I can take to get me to that because you're,

1161
01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:52.100
I think you're going to get fucked here. Sorry to say that. But um, yeah,

1162
01:09:52.101 --> 01:09:56.540
my advice would be to stop trying to measure up to a 34 year old,

1163
01:09:57.530 --> 01:10:02.480
just be 24. All right. I hope that helped you out. Um,

1164
01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:07.220

And a NFL playoffs. Playoffs are coming.

1178
01:10:45.471 --> 01:10:49.520
Bruins had a nice two game win streak over the sabers and then we fucking lost

1179
01:10:49.521 --> 01:10:53.060
yesterday. I missed that game. Got fucking smoked three to nothing.

1180
01:10:54.710 --> 01:10:59.540
But what do we play? Played fucking the Carolina Hurricanes. Um,

1181
01:11:00.350 --> 01:11:03.670
that's it. Hey everybody, the holidays are over to brand new fucking year. Uh,

1182
01:11:03.950 --> 01:11:08.000
don't deal with bipolar people. All right? If you've got to make a left,

1183
01:11:08.001 --> 01:11:12.050
get over towards the double line. Uh, don't liquidate your fucking insurance.

1184
01:11:12.051 --> 01:11:14.100
So, uh, you can try to fucking

1185
01:11:14.190 --> 01:11:16.620
<v 10>bang a 40 year old and uh,</v>

1186
01:11:18.630 --> 01:11:19.800
I think that's it. Yeah.

1187
01:11:19.801 --> 01:11:23.640
And if you bang your a lesbian sister's girlfriend,

1188
