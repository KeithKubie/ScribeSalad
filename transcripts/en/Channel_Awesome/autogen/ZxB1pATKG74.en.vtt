maybe you can interpret a totally
 

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:02.259
maybe you can interpret a totally
different way but I'm saying my way the

00:08:02.259 --> 00:08:02.269
different way but I'm saying my way the
 

00:08:02.269 --> 00:08:04.299
different way but I'm saying my way the
interpretation I got I predicted the

00:08:04.299 --> 00:08:04.309
interpretation I got I predicted the
 

00:08:04.309 --> 00:08:06.129
interpretation I got I predicted the
whole thing so I'm assuming this is what

00:08:06.129 --> 00:08:06.139
whole thing so I'm assuming this is what
 

00:08:06.139 --> 00:08:10.059

maybe maybe that's kind of the idea

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:43.480
maybe maybe that's kind of the idea
 

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.990
maybe maybe that's kind of the idea
maybe it's that I'm just reading it so

what's going on and it can't be
interpreted any other way and maybe

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:54.100
interpreted any other way and maybe
 

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:55.530
interpreted any other way and maybe
other people could see it and see as

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:55.540
other people could see it and see as
 

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:56.970
other people could see it and see as
something totally different

00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:56.980
something totally different

something totally different
I actually I didn't I don't know what

00:09:59.429 --> 00:09:59.439

other people reading into this because
 

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:03.329
other people reading into this because
all I know is that I would sort of watch

00:10:03.329 --> 00:10:03.339
all I know is that I would sort of watch
 

00:10:03.339 --> 00:10:06.059
all I know is that I would sort of watch
the first like minute or two of people's

00:10:06.059 --> 00:10:06.069
the first like minute or two of people's
 

00:10:06.069 --> 00:10:07.800
the first like minute or two of people's

reviews just to see if they liked it or
 

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:09.030
reviews just to see if they liked it or
not because again they said if you don't

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:09.040
not because again they said if you don't
 

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.620
not because again they said if you don't
want know anything about it stop here

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:10.630
want know anything about it stop here
 

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:12.389
want know anything about it stop here
and I did I stopped there I didn't look

00:10:12.389 --> 00:10:12.399

it's really really left open and it's
not made clear and I my problem it's

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:19.660
not made clear and I my problem it's
 

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:22.470
not made clear and I my problem it's
it's it's it's made a little too clear I

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:22.480
it's it's it's made a little too clear I
 

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:25.290
it's it's it's made a little too clear I
would have liked it if we don't if they

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:25.300
would have liked it if we don't if they

would liked it the two sons didn't come

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:28.870
would liked it the two sons didn't come
 

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:30.389
would liked it the two sons didn't come
in and one kills the other and so I

00:10:30.389 --> 00:10:30.399
in and one kills the other and so I
 

00:10:30.399 --> 00:10:32.129
in and one kills the other and so I
would have liked it if that was kept a

00:10:32.129 --> 00:10:32.139
would have liked it if that was kept a
 

00:10:32.139 --> 00:10:33.720
would have liked it if that was kept a
little bit more vague especially because

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:33.730
little bit more vague especially because
 

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:36.179
little bit more vague especially because
other stuff is kind of told out of order

00:10:36.179 --> 00:10:36.189
other stuff is kind of told out of order
 

00:10:36.189 --> 00:10:37.829
other stuff is kind of told out of order
and done out of order it's more themes

00:10:37.829 --> 00:10:37.839
and done out of order it's more themes
 

00:10:37.839 --> 00:10:40.670
and done out of order it's more themes
and ideas see that's the stuff I like

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:40.680
and ideas see that's the stuff I like
 

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:44.129
and ideas see that's the stuff I like
but even if it even if it is that as it

but even if it even if it is that as it
 

00:10:44.139 --> 00:10:46.079
but even if it even if it is that as it
it's like they don't change a word or

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:20.519
Earth and the Xavier II is like God and
you know or whatever you want to call

00:14:20.519 --> 00:14:20.529
you know or whatever you want to call

them and the baby is Jesus and Cain and
 

00:14:22.839 --> 00:14:24.720
them and the baby is Jesus and Cain and

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:24.730
Abel and it's definitely maybe I could
 

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:27.090

out no it's not what I was saying at all

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:28.420
out no it's not what I was saying at all
 

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:32.220
out no it's not what I was saying at all
but like I said I did predict where the

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:32.230
but like I said I did predict where the
 

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:34.470
but like I said I did predict where the
story was going because I made that

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:34.480
story was going because I made that
 

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:38.610
story was going because I made that
assumption so I feel like that that's

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:38.620
assumption so I feel like that that's
 

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:40.170
assumption so I feel like that that's
not a bad assumption to make

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:40.180
not a bad assumption to make
 

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:41.699
not a bad assumption to make
but again the great thing about is that

00:14:41.699 --> 00:14:41.709
but again the great thing about is that
 

00:14:41.709 --> 00:14:44.670
but again the great thing about is that
it is an abstract film you can draw

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:44.680
it is an abstract film you can draw
 

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:47.970
it is an abstract film you can draw
whatever conclusion do you like I think

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:47.980
whatever conclusion do you like I think
 

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:50.610
whatever conclusion do you like I think
a lot of people are gonna be annoyed by

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:50.620
a lot of people are gonna be annoyed by
 

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:52.889
a lot of people are gonna be annoyed by

so crazy abstract and here's the other
 

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:57.150
so crazy abstract and here's the other
thing too okay the crazy abstract at the

00:14:57.150 --> 00:14:57.160
thing too okay the crazy abstract at the
 

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.550
thing too okay the crazy abstract at the
end that's fine but it has a bunch of

00:14:59.550 --> 00:14:59.560
end that's fine but it has a bunch of
 

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:00.990
end that's fine but it has a bunch of
people coming in and everything it goes
