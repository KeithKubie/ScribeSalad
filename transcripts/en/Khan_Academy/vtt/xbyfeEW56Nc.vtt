00:00:01.108 --> 00:00:02.577
You've probably heard of

00:00:02.577 --> 00:00:04.481
people having a stroke,

00:00:04.481 --> 00:00:07.750
and you're probably familiar with the notion

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.049
that it has something to do

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:10.985
with the brain, and you'd be right.

00:00:10.985 --> 00:00:14.453
In particular, it's a rapid loss of

00:00:14.453 --> 00:00:15.922
brain function because of

00:00:15.922 --> 00:00:17.903
something strange happening

00:00:17.903 --> 00:00:20.938
with the blood flow to the brain.

00:00:20.938 --> 00:00:21.960
And let me show you that

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.446
in a little bit more detail.

00:00:23.446 --> 00:00:24.359
And to do that,

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:24.859
let's think about

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:26.604
the 2 major types of strokes.

00:00:26.604 --> 00:00:32.708
There's the ischemic strokes,

00:00:34.215 --> 00:00:35.377
and the other type of stroke

00:00:35.377 --> 00:00:36.605
is hemorrhagic,

00:00:36.605 --> 00:00:38.933
and these can kind of be sub-categorized,

00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:44.159
but I won't go into all of the details there.

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:46.046
And if I really just define

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:48.399
ischemia and hemorrhaging to you,

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:49.390
I think you'll have an idea

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:50.921
of how these strokes are different

00:00:50.921 --> 00:00:53.197
and how they interrupt the blood flow

00:00:53.197 --> 00:00:55.751
to different parts of the brain.

00:00:55.751 --> 00:00:57.192
You know from the videos on

00:00:57.192 --> 00:00:59.141
stenosis and ischemia

00:00:59.141 --> 00:01:00.613
and the videos on heart attacks

00:01:00.613 --> 00:01:01.743
that ischemia is

00:01:01.743 --> 00:01:03.087
a lack of blood flow

00:01:03.087 --> 00:01:05.968
to certain body tissues.

00:01:05.968 --> 00:01:07.918
So an ischemic stroke is actually

00:01:07.918 --> 00:01:09.637
very, very similar to what we saw

00:01:09.637 --> 00:01:10.844
in a heart attack,

00:01:10.844 --> 00:01:11.502
except it's not occurring

00:01:11.502 --> 00:01:12.858
in a coronary blood vessel,

00:01:12.858 --> 00:01:14.792
it's occurring in a blood vessel

00:01:14.792 --> 00:01:16.140
in the brain.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.399
So let me draw that right over here.

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:19.482
Let's say that this is

00:01:19.482 --> 00:01:24.123
a blood vessel in the brain.

00:01:25.877 --> 00:01:27.562
And let's say that blood is flowing

00:01:27.562 --> 00:01:29.689
in that direction (this is an artery).

00:01:30.458 --> 00:01:31.510
And so you could imagine

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.835
that maybe there is a big blood clot

00:01:33.835 --> 00:01:35.598
that forms in some part of the brain.

00:01:35.598 --> 00:01:37.270
Let me do the blood clot in magenta.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.755
This blood clot might form because --

00:01:38.755 --> 00:01:40.566
no, that's not magenta --

00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:41.867
the blood clot might form

00:01:41.867 --> 00:01:43.621
because maybe there's a plaque there,

00:01:43.621 --> 00:01:45.581
maybe the plaque got ruptured,

00:01:45.581 --> 00:01:48.460
either way, this clot is restricting

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:49.314
the flow of blood.

00:01:49.314 --> 00:01:50.706
And we know that this blood clot --

00:01:50.706 --> 00:01:54.284
we can call this a thrombus,

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.363
or we could say that thrombosis

00:01:57.363 --> 00:01:58.667
has occurred over here--

00:01:58.667 --> 00:02:01.667
either way, the blood flow is restricted,

00:02:01.667 --> 00:02:05.491
and the brain tissue that's further downstream

00:02:05.491 --> 00:02:07.269
is not going to get its oxygen,

00:02:07.269 --> 00:02:11.135
and it might die; it might experience infarction.

00:02:11.135 --> 00:02:13.250
And that's why ischemic strokes are also

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.471
sometimes called cerebral infarctions.

00:02:19.533 --> 00:02:20.898
These are all very fancy words,

00:02:20.898 --> 00:02:22.595
but I think, hopefully, they're becoming

00:02:22.595 --> 00:02:24.561
a little bit more common in our vocabulary,

00:02:24.561 --> 00:02:27.378
they keep showing up over and over again.

00:02:27.378 --> 00:02:29.015
And I also want to be clear:

00:02:29.015 --> 00:02:30.933
most strokes are actually

00:02:30.933 --> 00:02:32.801
ischemic strokes.

00:02:32.801 --> 00:02:34.318
The numbers I looked up, they say,

00:02:34.318 --> 00:02:39.887
87% of strokes are ischemic.

00:02:39.887 --> 00:02:41.558
Now, the other type of way

00:02:41.558 --> 00:02:42.982
that you could have ischemia

00:02:42.982 --> 00:02:44.004
in one of these blood vessels,

00:02:44.004 --> 00:02:45.159
and this is completely analogous

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:47.578
to what we saw in the heart,

00:02:47.578 --> 00:02:49.400
when we had heart attacks, is:

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.737
you could have thrombosis,

00:02:50.737 --> 00:02:52.919
or you could also have an embolism.

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:55.891
Whenever someone says thrombosis,

00:02:55.891 --> 00:02:57.609
or a thrombus, or thrombi,

00:02:57.609 --> 00:02:59.205
they're talking about blood clots.

00:02:59.205 --> 00:03:00.257
Whenever someone talks about

00:03:00.257 --> 00:03:03.540
an embolus, or emboli, or embolism,

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:04.575
they're talking about something

00:03:04.575 --> 00:03:05.933
moving through the blood

00:03:05.933 --> 00:03:08.569
that eventually blocks a blood vessel.

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:09.298
So you can actually have

00:03:09.298 --> 00:03:10.647
a thromboembolism,

00:03:10.647 --> 00:03:14.096
you can actually have a blood clot

00:03:14.096 --> 00:03:15.442
that gets broken off --

00:03:17.734 --> 00:03:19.933
so let me ignore this for now--

00:03:19.933 --> 00:03:22.116
let me paint over it a little bit

00:03:22.116 --> 00:03:24.547
so that this isn't the main cause of blockage--

00:03:24.547 --> 00:03:26.421
but you could actually have a blood clot

00:03:26.421 --> 00:03:33.530
that breaks off, becomes an embolus,

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.753
and since it's an embolus due to a blood clot,

00:03:35.753 --> 00:03:37.921
you call it a thrombembolus --

00:03:37.921 --> 00:03:39.823
I always have trouble saying all of these words--

00:03:39.823 --> 00:03:46.498
and eventually it blocks an artery over here.

00:03:46.498 --> 00:03:51.713
So this right here is an embolism,

00:03:51.713 --> 00:03:53.933
but either way, you're blocking the blood flow

00:03:53.933 --> 00:03:55.600
further down the brain,

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.559
[which] could cause infarction,

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:57.937
that brain tissue will die,

00:03:57.937 --> 00:04:00.118
and whatever that brain tissue did

00:04:00.118 --> 00:04:03.183
for mental function, or whatever,

00:04:03.183 --> 00:04:04.529
is going to make it very hard

00:04:04.529 --> 00:04:06.248
for this person who is experiencing this stroke

00:04:06.248 --> 00:04:08.245
to do those things.

00:04:08.245 --> 00:04:08.895
Now, it's not always noticeable,

00:04:08.895 --> 00:04:11.913
that's called a silent stroke,

00:04:11.913 --> 00:04:13.771
but damage is occurring.

00:04:13.771 --> 00:04:15.072
The person experiencing the stroke--

00:04:15.072 --> 00:04:16.110
and I'm not a doctor,

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:17.720
so take all of this with a grain of salt--

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.272
the person experiencing the stroke

00:04:20.272 --> 00:04:21.358
could be anywhere from -

00:04:21.358 --> 00:04:22.751
well, one, they may not even notice

00:04:22.751 --> 00:04:24.391
that damage is occurring,

00:04:24.391 --> 00:04:25.784
they might have a headache,

00:04:25.784 --> 00:04:26.838
or it might be more severe,

00:04:26.838 --> 00:04:28.074
they might actually

00:04:28.074 --> 00:04:29.667
not be able to properly move

00:04:29.667 --> 00:04:30.954
a side of their body,

00:04:30.954 --> 00:04:32.116
or a side of their face,

00:04:32.116 --> 00:04:33.294
or properly be able to speak,

00:04:33.294 --> 00:04:34.471
so it really depends on what

00:04:34.471 --> 00:04:37.100
part of the brain is being damaged.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.000
But in either of these situations,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.723
an ischemic stroke is caused by

00:04:40.723 --> 00:04:43.400
some type of restriction or blockage

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.667
that causes things downstream to not

00:04:45.667 --> 00:04:47.364
get proper oxygen, and then,

00:04:47.364 --> 00:04:48.170
so you can imagine,

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:49.365
cells over here aren't going

00:04:49.365 --> 00:04:50.313
to get their oxygen,

00:04:50.313 --> 00:04:53.045
and then they might actually die.

00:04:53.045 --> 00:04:54.330
A hemorrhagic stroke -

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.063
to hemorrhage means to bleed,

00:04:56.063 --> 00:04:58.267
it's literally just a fancy word for bleeding-

00:04:58.267 --> 00:05:00.197
and so in a hemorrhagic stroke

00:05:00.197 --> 00:05:02.441
you have a situation where a blood vessel

00:05:02.441 --> 00:05:06.369
can actually break, where you have a blood vessel-

00:05:06.369 --> 00:05:07.271
I'm actually trying to draw

00:05:07.271 --> 00:05:09.917
the same blood vessel- where it actually breaks.

00:05:09.917 --> 00:05:10.894
We'll talk more in the future

00:05:10.894 --> 00:05:12.610
of why a blood vessel might break -

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.236
strongly related to high blood pressure

00:05:14.236 --> 00:05:15.369
and other risk factors,

00:05:15.369 --> 00:05:17.053
but I don't want to get into that right now -

00:05:17.546 --> 00:05:19.738
but you could imagine if a blood vessel breaks,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.667
you have all this blood spewing into the brain

00:05:22.667 --> 00:05:24.593
in, kind of, an uncontrolled way.

00:05:24.593 --> 00:05:26.281
So let's say this little diagram

00:05:26.281 --> 00:05:27.610
[that] I drew right here,

00:05:28.087 --> 00:05:29.129
that part of the brain,

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:30.152
if you have a hemorrhagic stroke,

00:05:30.152 --> 00:05:31.296
you have all of this blood

00:05:31.296 --> 00:05:32.733
that's flowing into the brain,

00:05:32.733 --> 00:05:35.147
and all of that uncontrolled blood

00:05:35.147 --> 00:05:37.667
will mess up that part of the brain,

00:05:37.667 --> 00:05:39.625
that causes those neurons

00:05:39.625 --> 00:05:40.972
and brain tissue to malfunction

00:05:40.972 --> 00:05:43.000
and maybe causes some of them to die,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.189
and it would also cause

00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:46.343
the blood flow further dowstream

00:05:46.343 --> 00:05:47.905
to be impaired, so the stuff

00:05:47.905 --> 00:05:49.901
downstream aren't going to get

00:05:49.901 --> 00:05:50.911
the blood they need

00:05:50.911 --> 00:05:51.715
because all the blood

00:05:51.715 --> 00:05:54.795
is being released everywhere else.

00:05:54.795 --> 00:05:57.718
And since 87% of strokes are ischemic strokes,

00:05:57.718 --> 00:05:59.594
the remainder are hemorrhagic,

00:05:59.594 --> 99:59:59.999
so this is the remaining 13% of strokes.
