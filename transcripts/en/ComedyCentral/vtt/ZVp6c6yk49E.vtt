00:00:47.247 --> 00:00:48.949
THE GUY WHO HIRED HIM SAYS,

00:00:48.982 --> 00:00:51.285
I NEED YOU TO BURN THIS PLACE
TO THE [bleep] GROUND.

00:00:51.318 --> 00:00:53.187
I OWE A LOT OF MONEY ON IT.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.689
I PUT TOO MUCH MONEY
INTO THE ROOMS.

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:57.758
I PUT TOO MUCH MONEY
INTO THE CARPETS.

00:00:57.791 --> 00:01:00.460

INTO THE KITCHENS.

00:01:00.494 --> 00:01:05.933

00:01:14.107 --> 00:01:15.976

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:31.158
â™ª

00:01:35.596 --> 00:01:38.465
AND WHAT WAS CRAZY
ABOUT MY DAD WAS,

00:01:38.498 --> 00:01:41.502
WHILE THE PLACE WAS BURNING,
HE WOULD STICK AROUND

00:01:41.535 --> 00:01:43.837
AND WATCH IT BURN DOWN
WITH THE FIRE DEPARTMENT

00:01:43.871 --> 00:01:45.439
