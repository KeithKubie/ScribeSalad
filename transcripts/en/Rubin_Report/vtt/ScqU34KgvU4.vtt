1
00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.430
Oh [inaudible]

2
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.250
<v 1>thank you guys for that.
Well,
we've got a standing ovation before we do anything.</v>

3
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.680
This is the way it's supposed to be these days.
The,

4
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.650
but I'm having a very strange week because this is my third event in a row,
uh,

5
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.320
through turning point and today partly with the Iron Ran Institute.

6
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.920
I was at Umass on Monday and it was a great event,

7
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.150
totally respectful and find challenging questions with you guys.

8
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.780
Really just a great exchange of ideas.
Everything that I'm,

9
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.080
that I'm living for at the moment.

10
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.170
And then I was at the University of New Hampshire yesterday.

11
00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.920
Well is closer to die yesterday.

12
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.810
[inaudible] is just an absolute circus there.
Uh,

13
00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.010
they,
they could not secure a room on campus because of threats.

14
00:01:02.011 --> 00:01:04.830
They moved us,
but 300 students,

15
00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:09.831
they moved us to a 7,500 seat hockey arena,

16
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.510
which was very,
I felt like I was in an episode of Veep,

17
00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.470
like a faith background or something.
Um,

18
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.210
and just and screaming and noise makers and all of the things that you guys have

19
00:01:21.211 --> 00:01:25.150
come to know is,
are the things that are shutting down civil discourse.
Uh,

20
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.610
so I hope tonight that we'll,
we'll do it civilly.
We are completely open.

21
00:01:29.611 --> 00:01:31.890
You know,
you're on,
I just discussed.
We will,

22
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.830
we will take any and all questions that you guys have.

23
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.450
We have no plan right now other than to talk it out.
And we agree on some stuff.

24
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.660
Some stuff we disagree on.

25
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.710
You notice he's to my right and I [inaudible] somebody that is to the right of

26
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.910
your,
which now I'm sure Huffington post will call me.
All right.

27
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.100
[inaudible]
you guys see this today?
That'd be fair.

28
00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.890
Another one of these hit pieces.
I mean these people are not,

29
00:01:58.891 --> 00:02:03.810
every woman I'm friends with apparently is a Nazi,
which you know,
as a,

30
00:02:03.811 --> 00:02:08.250
as a former member of the IDF on top of that list.
Yeah.

31
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.580
So the point is if they're already protesters here,
he knows how to use a gun.

32
00:02:11.581 --> 00:02:16.090
So be careful.
[inaudible] that's right.
Okay.

33
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.270
So look,
we're going to talk about free markets.

34
00:02:18.271 --> 00:02:19.320
We're going to talk about free speech.

35
00:02:19.321 --> 00:02:22.440
We're going to talk about all the things that I think you guys know that we care

36
00:02:22.441 --> 00:02:25.950
about and we're excited to be here.
So I thought,
first off,

37
00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.810
I'm going to throw something kind of interesting at you.

38
00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.170
I think something seriously big shifted in the universe last week because of

39
00:02:34.351 --> 00:02:37.030
Kanye west and yeah,

40
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.260
I can't believe I'm saying that [inaudible] I'm more of a Frank Sinatra guy

41
00:02:45.091 --> 00:02:48.240
myself,
but,
but Kanye,

42
00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.430
I think by tweeting seven words,

43
00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:55.490
I love the way Candace Owens thinks he offered oxygen to the space that I think

44
00:02:56.131 --> 00:02:57.120
you guys are in.

45
00:02:57.121 --> 00:03:02.121
And he just offered a little space for some other people to think a little bit

46
00:03:02.981 --> 00:03:03.431
differently,

47
00:03:03.431 --> 00:03:07.450
to look a little more critically at some of the issues that we're constantly

48
00:03:07.451 --> 00:03:11.440
talking about.
And he's talking about the individual.
And I,

49
00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:13.360
the second what happened,
I called you and I said,

50
00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.160
this is a moment for you guys because Kanye West is talking about the
individual.

51
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.640
Do you think I'm crazy for this?
Uh,
thought,

52
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.760
<v 2>no,
I think,
I think we are at an interesting moment in time.</v>

53
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.290
I think that,
I actually think that the rest,
and I know,

54
00:03:32.291 --> 00:03:35.560
I know a lot of people disagree with me on this.
I think the left is in retreat.

55
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.440
The left is completely and utterly bankrupt.

56
00:03:38.441 --> 00:03:40.960
And I think New Hampshire was kind of evidence of that.

57
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.610
When you completely bankrupt,

58
00:03:42.611 --> 00:03:45.460
where do you have nothing to say when you have no way to go,

59
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.420
you get noisemakers and you make lots of noise because you can't actually

60
00:03:49.421 --> 00:03:53.710
communicate anymore.
You,
Oh,
you can do is yell and shout and scream and,

61
00:03:53.711 --> 00:03:57.850
and you know,
you're,
you're like a little child because you're completely,
oh,

62
00:03:57.851 --> 00:03:59.860
you haven't said emotion,
you have no mind anymore.

63
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.430
And I really think that the left is,

64
00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.710
it's not bad obviously,

65
00:04:05.711 --> 00:04:10.120
because it holds the universities and it holds massive political power still.

66
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:11.650
But the radical,

67
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.910
the crazy than nutty left is an illustration of that.

68
00:04:15.911 --> 00:04:20.260
This whole thing is in decline.
And even county arrest sees it,
right?

69
00:04:20.261 --> 00:04:24.430
So it's gotten to the point where even some people in pop culture,
uh,

70
00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:28.510
looking at these people and saying,
no,
no,
this,
this is nuts.

71
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.510
There's not,
there's no there,
there,
there's nothing.

72
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.090
There's nothing to hold onto.
There's no values there.
Well,

73
00:04:36.091 --> 00:04:39.520
what are we gonna do with these people?
And I think of all the communities,

74
00:04:39.521 --> 00:04:44.090
the black community should be the one at the forefront of this because they've

75
00:04:44.091 --> 00:04:47.950
been betrayed by the left for generations now.
You know,

76
00:04:47.951 --> 00:04:50.920
since the civil rights movement where yes,

77
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:55.450
the people stood up for them and marched with them and they deserve all the

78
00:04:55.451 --> 00:04:56.680
credit in the world for doing that.

79
00:04:56.681 --> 00:05:01.270
But since then the war on poverty is not helped them.
All the,

80
00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:02.830
all the whole welfare state,

81
00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.520
everything that the government has tried to do to so called the help them has

82
00:05:06.521 --> 00:05:10.630
actually made them worse off and things are worse.
I mean,
she called go,

83
00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.840
it's probably the best place in the world right now to see this.
Right.

84
00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.400
Because they are worse off than if they'd never been a war on poverty.

85
00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:21.850
If they'd never been,
you know,
certain parts of the Civil Rights Act,

86
00:05:21.851 --> 00:05:26.470
if they've never been this massive attempt somehow to help them,
you know,

87
00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.910
to mother government is here to help you.
Right.
That is an awful,

88
00:05:30.911 --> 00:05:35.470
awful sign when somebody says that right to you.
So I think,

89
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.650
I think,
I think the bankrupt,
I think they're out of ideas.

90
00:05:38.651 --> 00:05:42.070
I don't know if you saw Bernie Sanders latest idea is that the governor's

91
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.060
guarantee a job to everybody.
Everybody gets a job like,

92
00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.890
like if you can't find a job in the private sector will pay you 15 bucks an
hour.

93
00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:55.420
You can dig ditches and fill them in.
Right.
All Day long.
They can fail,

94
00:05:55.421 --> 00:05:57.860
they can fail.
And this is a serious proposal.

95
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.850
We've got two other Democrats who are running for president who have endorsed

96
00:06:01.851 --> 00:06:05.710
this,
uh,
uh,
booker and uh,
not Camilla Harris,

97
00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:10.660
the other woman from New York.
Uh,
the New York senator.
Yeah.
Band.

98
00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:12.640
Right.
And I mean,
this is not easy.

99
00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.170
This is did you just announced that they're both running for president

100
00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:21.070
if nobody knew [inaudible] regulations.
Yeah.
Um,

101
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:26.180
and you know,
that's just so stupid,
right?

102
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.960
That there's nothing,
there's nothing there.

103
00:06:29.961 --> 00:06:34.520
They will question is,
and the real question is,
okay,
so why,

104
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:39.340
what now?
Right.
What,
what,
what places of what fills the void?
What,
what is,
uh,

105
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:44.560
what is the alternative to this nuttiness and the idea that Kenya West is

106
00:06:44.811 --> 00:06:47.060
talking about the individual.
I don't know what he means by that.

107
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.310
I see all kinds of tweets by him,
so that makes sense.

108
00:06:49.311 --> 00:06:51.660
Some of them a completely weird.
Um,

109
00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:57.580
but if we can start having a discussion about the individual and what that means

110
00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:59.011
and,

111
00:06:59.011 --> 00:07:02.660
and there may be what individual rights mean and what does individualism mean?

112
00:07:02.661 --> 00:07:05.510
And maybe get him a copy of the fountain head.
Maybe you can read that.

113
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:10.400
Then it becomes interesting.
Then we're talking about the white kind of things.

114
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:15.110
If the alternative is,
sorry,
make America great again,

115
00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.850
then I'm dubious that,
you know,
I'm,

116
00:07:17.851 --> 00:07:21.620
I'm a make America eat again is a big guy.
I don't know about that.

117
00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.680
I think that's just a dent in the habit.
Um,

118
00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:30.140
it looks good though.
Um,

119
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:34.760
I don't know that that's the answer that I liked this idea of talking about the

120
00:07:34.761 --> 00:07:36.550
individual.
Well,
look,
I don't know,
but is

121
00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:39.670
<v 3>the answer either.
I don't think I look,
as I said in my direct message last week,</v>

122
00:07:39.671 --> 00:07:42.790
I don't know what Kanye is.
Political beliefs are at any moment.
You know,

123
00:07:42.791 --> 00:07:45.340
all of these people that are now worshiping him as a hero,

124
00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:49.000
they most likely will come to regret it when he does something nutty.

125
00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:53.620
But I think he offered oxygen to a space that needed a little oxygen.
You know,

126
00:07:53.621 --> 00:07:57.010
a few of us,
what Eric Weinstein calls the intellectual dark web.

127
00:07:57.011 --> 00:08:00.700
There's been this group of about 20 people kind of trying to just say,

128
00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:04.120
you know what?
Some of us are on the left,
Sam Harris,
some of us are on the right,

129
00:08:04.121 --> 00:08:04.721
Ben Shapiro,

130
00:08:04.721 --> 00:08:09.070
but we're trying to figure out what the answers are without destroying each

131
00:08:09.071 --> 00:08:11.830
other.
And I think Connie offered a little air to that.

132
00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:15.910
But also what's interesting to me is the way the media suddenly just went on a

133
00:08:15.911 --> 00:08:18.680
complete rampage against him.
And,

134
00:08:18.681 --> 00:08:22.660
and the lead moment in Twitter moments was about far right.

135
00:08:22.661 --> 00:08:24.760
Candice Owens far right.
Candice Owens,

136
00:08:24.761 --> 00:08:28.900
who's had dinner at my house with me and my husband.
I mean,
this woman,

137
00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:32.290
she's not a,
she's black by the way.
Not The black people can't be racist,

138
00:08:32.291 --> 00:08:35.350
but they're calling her auntie black the way that they're,
you know,

139
00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:39.790
all these hit pieces that run on Kanye.
Did you guys see the,
the uh,

140
00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:44.020
peace that Maxine waters released a statement about Kanye that he should

141
00:08:44.021 --> 00:08:46.040
basically stay in his lane and,
and,

142
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:50.440
and it's like this is actually the soft bigotry of low expectations that,

143
00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:54.310
that someone dares to think differently and you say,
no,
no,
no,
we're,

144
00:08:54.311 --> 00:08:57.570
we're going to put them plantation where we've kept you.
Yeah,
exactly.

145
00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:01.670
And this has to be fought.
No,
it definitely,
and I think get also gives it,

146
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:06.570
you know,
space now to other people in entertainment business that,
you know,

147
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:10.620
as you know,
yeah.
As a silent because they were afraid he end,

148
00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:15.510
he gives space to I think that minority community that feels betrayed by the

149
00:09:15.511 --> 00:09:18.930
left to speak out against it.
And,
and that is,
they've never spoken.

150
00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:20.850
They're not afraid to speak to that point.

151
00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:25.200
I almost every day now I get a direct message on Twitter from somebody that's a

152
00:09:25.201 --> 00:09:25.981
public person,

153
00:09:25.981 --> 00:09:29.820
either a musician or an actor or something telling me that they agree with me,

154
00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:33.020
but they won't say it publicly.
I,
I got something today from somebody in,

155
00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:33.810
in the music.

156
00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:37.320
Is that most of you probably know saying that they were afraid to come out of

157
00:09:37.321 --> 00:09:40.080
the closet,
would you,
I mean that was the phrase they use.
I mean,

158
00:09:40.081 --> 00:09:43.580
were you part of Friends of Abe,
the secret society in Hollywood or we are out,

159
00:09:43.581 --> 00:09:45.030
we spoke about that.
It was before,

160
00:09:45.031 --> 00:09:49.830
right before I moved to La to be a secret society in Los Angeles called friends

161
00:09:49.831 --> 00:09:54.270
of ape,
which was all the directors,
producers,
lighting people,

162
00:09:54.271 --> 00:09:58.950
everybody in the film industry who was left of,

163
00:09:58.951 --> 00:10:03.250
I dunno,
Lennon.
Oh right,
of lenders.
Yeah,
right.
You know,
right.
Of Right.
Of,
of,

164
00:10:03.251 --> 00:10:04.560
of a leftist agenda.

165
00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:08.970
And they used to get together and there was a coffee shop in Hollywood where

166
00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:11.070
like every Wednesday they would get,
you know,

167
00:10:11.071 --> 00:10:12.930
people would get together and wasn't that many of them.

168
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:16.140
And then once in a while they have these big gatherings and I went once in a

169
00:10:16.141 --> 00:10:20.560
while,
3000 people and a lot of people like I know that guy.
I don't,

170
00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:25.610
you know all these movie stars data you didn't know and they all stay silent

171
00:10:26.461 --> 00:10:28.830
because they were afraid.
We're talking about 3000 people.

172
00:10:28.831 --> 00:10:31.860
Some of them the biggest,
some of the biggest producers in Hollywood,

173
00:10:31.861 --> 00:10:36.861
some of the biggest actors in Hollywood will not come out as being conservatives

174
00:10:37.351 --> 00:10:42.090
are being libertarian or being anything other than the left because they were

175
00:10:42.091 --> 00:10:43.560
afraid for their livelihood.

176
00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.920
But that's why I love doing these events with you guys because I truly believe

177
00:10:46.921 --> 00:10:47.250
this,

178
00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:51.390
that we are living in such a unique time right now where everything is up in the

179
00:10:51.391 --> 00:10:56.370
air.
The world truly is yours.
When you get out of college,
like every,

180
00:10:56.371 --> 00:10:59.910
there is nobody that knows what's going to happen tomorrow,

181
00:10:59.911 --> 00:11:03.150
much less than a year from now.
Nobody knows that Trump has,

182
00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:05.250
has just tossed the chess board up.

183
00:11:05.251 --> 00:11:07.980
The pieces are everywhere and you guys were able to make the future.

184
00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:12.120
And the funny thing is when I agreed to do some events with Iran and Ari,

185
00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:14.610
I got people telling me that,
oh you know,
I'm working with these,

186
00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:17.760
these far right maniacs and I've gotten to know you pretty well and,

187
00:11:17.761 --> 00:11:21.360
and you're constantly screaming about freedom.
I mean all you care about,

188
00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:25.290
the only thing you care about is freedom.
So it leads me to this.

189
00:11:25.291 --> 00:11:28.350
I want to do a little poll and let's do it by applause so that the live stream

190
00:11:28.351 --> 00:11:31.740
people can catch it.
How many of you at one time were on the left?

191
00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.260
<v 0>Yeah,
I can be in that too.
Yeah.</v>

192
00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:41.760
<v 3>And how many of you would say your conservative now?
How many concerns?</v>

193
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:45.520
<v 0>Yeah,
I supposed to clap.
Yeah,</v>

194
00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:48.720
<v 3>still doing the hands.
Okay.
Uh,
how many of you are libertarian?</v>

195
00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:56.260
<v 0>There's always one loud room cause if few object gallery drives in,</v>

196
00:11:56.261 --> 00:11:59.990
ladies and gentlemen right here.
Uh,
and yeah.
How many of you were objected this,

197
00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:06.210
uh,
how many of you are

198
00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.800
<v 3>progressive?
Do we have any progressive's here?</v>

199
00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:12.810
<v 0>We're going a little rule and you,
you kind of,
oh,
we got one right here</v>

200
00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:16.730
<v 3>and you kind of nodded half a little bit or I don't know if you're just shifting</v>

201
00:12:16.731 --> 00:12:18.350
in your seat,
but it's good.
That's great.
I mean,

202
00:12:18.351 --> 00:12:21.080
I would love for progressive to be here and I'd love to take a question from you

203
00:12:21.081 --> 00:12:25.880
maybe at the end.
Um,
so,
all right,
so we have a little oxygen in this space.

204
00:12:25.881 --> 00:12:30.170
I do believe perhaps something has happened where we're starting to win a little

205
00:12:30.171 --> 00:12:32.060
bit.
Um,
I think that there's,

206
00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:35.000
they're lashing out the way they are because they're sort of like a wounded

207
00:12:35.001 --> 00:12:38.420
animal at the end who you're trying to put your hand out there and offer them

208
00:12:38.421 --> 00:12:42.740
something and they only know how to strike back.
So just very quickly,

209
00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:46.370
last night when I was at University of New Hampshire,
there was a one,
you know,

210
00:12:46.371 --> 00:12:46.640
there's,

211
00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:49.430
they're screaming and they're shouting me down and they got their noise makers

212
00:12:49.431 --> 00:12:51.530
and they're repetitive groaning.
I mean,
the,

213
00:12:51.531 --> 00:12:55.610
the chance they're like robots or zombies or whatever.
Uh,

214
00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:59.060
but there was a woman in the back,
uh,
who I had been talking about,

215
00:12:59.061 --> 00:13:02.480
Jordan Peterson,
and we'll put him on the map,
obviously was the bill in Canada,

216
00:13:02.481 --> 00:13:02.741
the,

217
00:13:02.741 --> 00:13:06.020
the Trans Bill that if you mis-gendered somebody you could potentially face a

218
00:13:06.021 --> 00:13:07.520
fine,
which perhaps could,

219
00:13:07.521 --> 00:13:10.220
we could have become a law and then imprisonment and all sorts of things.

220
00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:13.130
And Jordan said,
I have no issue with trans people,

221
00:13:13.131 --> 00:13:16.700
but I don't want the government to be allowed to tell me what I can and cannot

222
00:13:16.701 --> 00:13:19.430
say.
I think most rational people can agree with this.

223
00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:23.690
And I told that story and there was a trans woman in the back and she started

224
00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:26.010
yelling at me and,
and you know,

225
00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:27.650
telling me I don't like trans people and all that.

226
00:13:27.651 --> 00:13:31.340
And I told her that I want her to have the same rights as everyone else and live

227
00:13:31.341 --> 00:13:33.950
with the same dignity as everybody else and,

228
00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:37.880
and hopefully find someone that loves her in life and can find goodness and all

229
00:13:37.881 --> 00:13:39.560
that stuff.
And I said,

230
00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:42.200
is there anything that I just said there that would lead you to believe that I'm

231
00:13:42.201 --> 00:13:46.160
transphobic or a bigot or anything?
And I could see it in her.

232
00:13:46.161 --> 00:13:47.900
She didn't know what to do.

233
00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:51.020
So she basically just yelled that she hated me or something to that effect.

234
00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:54.020
And we have the video of this and maybe we'll release it.

235
00:13:54.021 --> 00:13:56.480
I don't want to make it about her because I think,
you know,

236
00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:59.480
the other guys often are attacking people.
I don't want to attack people,

237
00:13:59.481 --> 00:14:00.880
I want attack ideas,
but I,

238
00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:03.740
but I thought it was a good example of where we're at at the moment,

239
00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:06.920
which is there ain't much left.

240
00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:11.690
But now my question for you is how do you show people that they can get out and

241
00:14:11.691 --> 00:14:15.890
that they can realize that freedom and limited government and free markets and

242
00:14:15.891 --> 00:14:19.790
all of that actually is the answer.
Well first of all,

243
00:14:19.791 --> 00:14:22.180
five say that I just want to support what you say cause I,
I,
I,

244
00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:26.470
<v 2>I think it's really,
I mean it really is a backlash against these people.
And,</v>

245
00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:30.130
and you can see it,
I think vocally is a great example of this.
Right?
Um,

246
00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:32.310
last year bench,
have you ever tried to speak at Berkeley?

247
00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:36.150
And at Tifo went nuts and everybody went nuts and it was shut down and the

248
00:14:36.151 --> 00:14:38.520
university did nothing this year.
The university said,
no,

249
00:14:38.521 --> 00:14:42.150
we believe in free speech.
We're actually gonna let everybody speak.
I mean,

250
00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:44.850
you'd think they got that earlier,
but you know,

251
00:14:44.851 --> 00:14:48.960
maybe took a few riots and this year bench spoken.
Yeah,
the university,

252
00:14:48.961 --> 00:14:52.040
I spent $600,000 to protect him.

253
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:55.250
$600,000 so a little orthodox Jew could give a speech.

254
00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:58.460
Do you realize how insane that is?
But in an odd way,

255
00:14:58.461 --> 00:15:00.920
you went to Berkeley and I went to Bennett was,
you know,

256
00:15:00.921 --> 00:15:05.570
and I don't think they spent 600,000 but it was all our security yelling and it

257
00:15:05.571 --> 00:15:06.440
was fine.
But it happened.

258
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:11.330
And the point is that I think even administrations or some of these universities

259
00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:15.140
are figuring out that maybe the wrong strategy is to just let this run a muck

260
00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:19.880
and,
and that's a good sign.
Um,
how do you do it?
How do you convince people?

261
00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:24.140
And this is the key because the key is to have an alternative to have an

262
00:15:24.141 --> 00:15:27.860
alternative to what the left is offering and they has to be something positive

263
00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:30.020
that you have to inspire people with.

264
00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:34.580
And I think that positive has to be at a personal level,
I think.

265
00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:36.680
I think politics takes care of itself.

266
00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:40.670
I don't think the debate at the end of the day and a challenge at the end of the

267
00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:44.390
day and the discussion at the end of the day needs to be at the political level.

268
00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.160
The real question is,

269
00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:50.270
do you as an individual want to be able to make decisions for you?

270
00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:52.700
Do you value your life?

271
00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:56.930
Do you value your life enough to be,

272
00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:01.960
to want to live your life to the fullest and be able to make decisions about who

273
00:16:02.841 --> 00:16:07.250
you sleep with and who you marry and about what kind of business you want to

274
00:16:07.251 --> 00:16:12.050
start and what kind of profession you answer without getting permission,
right?

275
00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:16.790
So once you leave college,
do you get to make decisions for yourself?

276
00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:21.170
Is You'll light valuable enough to be able to you to be able to make those

277
00:16:21.171 --> 00:16:25.100
decisions for yourself?
That is really the key question.

278
00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:28.040
And if the answer is yes,
I want to make decisions for myself,

279
00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:31.700
then everything else follows easily from that.
And yes,

280
00:16:31.701 --> 00:16:34.160
I have the tool to make those decisions.
My mind,

281
00:16:34.161 --> 00:16:36.410
we all have this reasoning capacity.

282
00:16:36.411 --> 00:16:41.411
We all have the tool to make decisions and to live well for ourselves.

283
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:46.100
Then everything else flows from that.
Then it means that bought out right?

284
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:48.830
But out of my life,
leave me alone,

285
00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:53.890
which is all basically what we're asking politically is let the government be

286
00:16:54.291 --> 00:16:59.291
there to protect us from people wanting to intervene in our lives with force.

287
00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:02.570
And other than that,
leave us alone because we can take care of ourselves.

288
00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:05.940
<v 3>So I'm going to make a,
you're on blush here for a second.</v>

289
00:17:05.941 --> 00:17:08.730
I've told this story once or twice.
I think I said it to you,

290
00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:13.020
to your face with last time you did my show.
But he's not just saying this,

291
00:17:13.021 --> 00:17:14.870
this isn't just stuff he's saying.
He's,

292
00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:19.020
he's really telling you something on the human level that is very true.

293
00:17:19.021 --> 00:17:22.200
And I know it because I heard it from him and it changed my life.

294
00:17:22.201 --> 00:17:24.980
So as some of you may know,
we were on aura TV.
Uh,

295
00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:28.680
the Rubin report was on or a TV for awhile after we left the young Turks and the

296
00:17:28.681 --> 00:17:31.980
show.
That's when the show really started blowing up and bigger.

297
00:17:31.981 --> 00:17:36.040
The show got the more that the network wanted from us and some of their failing

298
00:17:36.041 --> 00:17:39.300
shows,
they were kind of letting skate by and I couldn't really understand that.

299
00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:42.420
I thought you need to be giving us more now so that we can expand.

300
00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:44.430
But instead they wanted to take more from us.

301
00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:48.210
And I had never met you before before you had been on my show.
You came in,

302
00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:53.430
we sat for an hour and your own talked about rational self interest and why you

303
00:17:54.151 --> 00:17:58.370
should fight for the things that you believe in and that you shouldn't just give

304
00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:01.350
of yourself endlessly and everything else that you just said.

305
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:03.270
And we finished that interview.

306
00:18:03.271 --> 00:18:06.630
I walked right into the control room and my team was in there and I said to
them,

307
00:18:06.631 --> 00:18:09.780
guys,
I'm going to leave here and I hope you'll come with me.

308
00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.990
And fortunately the guys that I wanted to come with me came with me.

309
00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:16.440
And from that moment of two months later,

310
00:18:16.441 --> 00:18:20.160
we launched independently and my life completely changed and the show has blown

311
00:18:20.161 --> 00:18:22.650
up since then.
And I've used those ideas.

312
00:18:22.651 --> 00:18:26.820
I mean the way that I've even built my business has been with these principles.

313
00:18:26.821 --> 00:18:28.890
So I know that these are real things.
These aren't,

314
00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:30.180
he's not just sitting here saying,

315
00:18:30.181 --> 00:18:34.170
take charge of your life as if as if it's some like,
you know,
Mumbo jumbo.

316
00:18:34.171 --> 00:18:35.370
It's something that's real.

317
00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:37.500
<v 2>I know.
And I'm saying it because it affected me.
To me,</v>

318
00:18:37.501 --> 00:18:40.530
this is like a thousand times when we pulled in the politics.
I mean,

319
00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:45.060
what's really important is what you as an individual do with your life.

320
00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:47.100
Whether you take responsibility for it,

321
00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:52.280
whether you really understand that you got one shot at this is no,

322
00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:57.210
we play every second you live,
you don't get again.
Right.
Never waste a second.

323
00:18:57.211 --> 00:18:58.044
In that sense,

324
00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:03.230
it's about living life to the fullest and making the most of that life and not

325
00:19:03.931 --> 00:19:05.340
just,
you know,

326
00:19:05.341 --> 00:19:08.750
we're taught from when we're this big that we should sacrifice fathers,

327
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:13.550
that we should compromise and we should always do what the majority wants.
No,

328
00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:18.420
none of that is true.
All of that is bad advice.
Right?
Break the rules.

329
00:19:18.421 --> 00:19:20.280
I was just with somebody today and he said,

330
00:19:20.281 --> 00:19:24.390
he's giving a commencement address to the high school at Wayne's daughter goes,

331
00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:28.860
and he's,
and he's,
the theme is go break the rules and he asked me,

332
00:19:28.861 --> 00:19:30.210
which rules would you break

333
00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:38.010
[inaudible] I said,
you know,
that's hard.
I need to think of it as a positive.

334
00:19:38.011 --> 00:19:40.440
I said,
I said,
you know,

335
00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:44.970
tools to principles that are the positives,
like live for yourself.

336
00:19:44.971 --> 00:19:48.450
Think for yourself,
and then what rules does that break?
Well,

337
00:19:48.451 --> 00:19:52.800
break them all code that has taught you,
you shouldn't live for yourself,

338
00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:54.740
that your purpose in life is to live to others.

339
00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:56.790
The purpose in life is to sacrifice that.

340
00:19:56.791 --> 00:20:01.320
The noblest thing you can do in life is to sacrifice for others,
right?

341
00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:04.470
No,
live for yourself.
You want to help others,
help others,

342
00:20:04.471 --> 00:20:09.030
but do it because it's good for you because it's good for the world in which you

343
00:20:09.031 --> 00:20:12.390
live in.
Right?
How do you,
how do you think the branding ending here

344
00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:15.410
<v 3>got so mucked up?
Because I think most people intuitively know this.</v>

345
00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:18.100
I see a lot of you guys nodding and obviously you know who we are,

346
00:20:18.101 --> 00:20:20.320
so we have a somewhat selected crowd here,

347
00:20:20.321 --> 00:20:23.110
but when we talk about this stuff now and eat again,

348
00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:24.280
I mean bringing it back to Connie,

349
00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:29.310
all he did was say to people think and that that has become controversial.

350
00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:33.010
Something happened with the branding and maybe it is all the things that we talk

351
00:20:33.011 --> 00:20:37.020
about,
about academia and that the schools,
and I'm sure you guys are,

352
00:20:37.021 --> 00:20:40.000
are suffering from some of this here,
professors that are,

353
00:20:40.001 --> 00:20:42.070
are indoctrinating you instead of teaching you.

354
00:20:42.071 --> 00:20:46.690
And if you dare say anything that's anything remotely close to small government,

355
00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:48.060
you'll,
you'll,
you know,

356
00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:48.971
<v 2>get guff for it.</v>

357
00:20:48.971 --> 00:20:52.330
Last night I had a student or at Umass I had a student who was telling me about

358
00:20:52.331 --> 00:20:56.590
all the anti Trump and Andy conservative stuff that their professor was telling

359
00:20:56.591 --> 00:21:00.770
him about.
I said,
what class is this?
Biology.
Biology.
Yeah.

360
00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:03.700
Well this is real.
This is real.

361
00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:09.280
This is,
but this is actually real.

362
00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:14.320
So what do you think happened that allowed this to get so confused?
Well,

363
00:21:14.321 --> 00:21:18.100
I mean that assumes that it's some event that happened on different issues.

364
00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:21.910
It's different things that have happened.
So on the issue of living for yourself,

365
00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:26.770
I mean this is a battle we beat fighting for 2000 years.
Really since the Greeks,

366
00:21:26.771 --> 00:21:31.060
right?
Christianity is anti this idea that you should live with yourself.

367
00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:35.170
It's all about sacrifice,
right?
Um,
but the Lakeman got it.
Wait,

368
00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:38.050
the founding fathers of this country did that collision of independence.

369
00:21:38.051 --> 00:21:40.900
It does not say you have a right to sacrifice.

370
00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:42.850
You should work for your community,

371
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.600
give shouty and do community service that's not in the declaration of

372
00:21:46.601 --> 00:21:50.650
independence,
the decoration and dependencies you ever white to your life.

373
00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:55.740
You have a right to your liberty and you have a right in the most self

374
00:21:55.741 --> 00:21:58.630
interested political statement in all of human history.

375
00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:02.980
You have an inalienable right to pursue your happiness,

376
00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:05.320
not some goop happiness.
Right.

377
00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:06.261
<v 0>All right.</v>

378
00:22:06.261 --> 00:22:11.261
The liberal [inaudible] the lightening.

379
00:22:12.581 --> 00:22:13.414
Got It right.

380
00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:18.350
<v 2>And,
but since 1900 and I know this was more history and philosophy,</v>

381
00:22:18.351 --> 00:22:19.101
maybe didn't want to hear,

382
00:22:19.101 --> 00:22:24.101
but since 1900 or 1800 there has been an effort primarily by the Germans,

383
00:22:24.801 --> 00:22:28.740
by the way,
by Melien an effort to undercut this too,

384
00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:32.750
to subvert it in the name of tribalism and the name of collectivism in the name

385
00:22:32.751 --> 00:22:36.380
of,
of religion,
in the name of fill in the blank,

386
00:22:36.381 --> 00:22:39.580
but to undercut the achievement of the enlightenment and the tube and other than

387
00:22:39.581 --> 00:22:40.610
lameness,
two ideas,

388
00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:45.560
reason as efficacious as the tool by which we survive and thrive and

389
00:22:45.561 --> 00:22:49.070
individualism.
The idea that the individual is what matters.

390
00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:53.260
Those two ideas of being undercut systematically from con,

391
00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:57.980
from a Hago,
Schopenhauer marks all the way to Nietzsche.

392
00:22:58.370 --> 00:23:02.690
And then of course the moderns if they're taking that up and as the left has

393
00:23:02.691 --> 00:23:06.950
become more and more and more dominant in the university as it has for the last

394
00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:10.520
hundred years.
I mean,
it was bad when I went to school 30 40 years ago.

395
00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:13.370
It's a hundred times worse now,
right?

396
00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:16.490
It's just getting worse and worse as they become more dominant.

397
00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:19.790
Those ideas have become the dominant ideas that everybody talks about.

398
00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:23.870
And now you're supposed to be regimented in your whim,
worship.

399
00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:26.420
You are supposed to have the same emotions.
Yeah.
You know,

400
00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:30.870
you are not allowed to think.
Thinking is,
is,
is,
it's this thing that whites,

401
00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:35.400
males do and it's,
you know,
it's impressive.
Reason is oppressive.
Yeah.

402
00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:37.380
Reason is a it.
Um,

403
00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:42.550
so it really has become a dominant within the culture in which we live dominant

404
00:23:44.301 --> 00:23:46.130
in the world,
which we live in academia.

405
00:23:46.131 --> 00:23:49.310
And this is why I think most Americans feel alienated from academia because they

406
00:23:49.311 --> 00:23:52.820
go,
what do you mean?
Of course I should live for myself at least to some degree.

407
00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:56.040
Right?
Of course.
I,
I,
you know,
I should,
uh,

408
00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:00.930
I should think,
what's this about?
Not Thinking this is stupid,
right?
Uh,

409
00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:03.020
and you're seeing this alienation between,

410
00:24:03.021 --> 00:24:06.020
a lot of Americans didn't go to college and who may be in the middle of the

411
00:24:06.021 --> 00:24:11.021
country or it didn't go to the big really left wing schools and the people who

412
00:24:11.811 --> 00:24:14.920
go to school,
the people who get brain washed by the professor and I brainwashed.

413
00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:18.050
But all they hear is one message.
Uh,

414
00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:21.920
so I think it's turned slowly over,
over,

415
00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:26.150
over a long period of time.
And it's a,
it's a,
it's a turn that's hap.
It's deep,

416
00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:29.390
<v 3>right?
It's,
it's deep,
full.
It's philosophically deep.</v>

417
00:24:29.391 --> 00:24:33.770
It's not just something in politics.
The change.
Yeah.

418
00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:38.540
It's something about our view of the fundamental nature of reality and of

419
00:24:38.541 --> 00:24:41.170
mankind.
So I want to dive into that a little bit cause we,

420
00:24:41.171 --> 00:24:43.460
we haven't done too much of that together,
but quickly,

421
00:24:43.461 --> 00:24:47.810
I'm curious how many of you actually agree with what I started with that

422
00:24:47.811 --> 00:24:50.800
something maybe has shifted and perhaps we're winning now.
If you'd left,

423
00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:52.040
let's do it by applause again,

424
00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:57.140
<v 0>Jessica [inaudible]</v>

425
00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.210
<v 3>I really do believe that and,
and that's gonna be the interesting place.</v>

426
00:25:01.211 --> 00:25:03.960
But let's,
let's get to some of that underpinning of this because,
you know,
I,

427
00:25:03.961 --> 00:25:06.880
I talk with,
with so many people who I,
who I admire,

428
00:25:06.881 --> 00:25:09.630
who are great thinkers from Sam Harrison,

429
00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:12.430
Jordan Peterson and Michael Shermer and Steven Pinker,

430
00:25:12.431 --> 00:25:13.990
who you mentioned in the theories of these people.

431
00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:17.260
And there seems to be a debate sort of weather,

432
00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:21.900
whether reason alone is enough of the bedrock to,

433
00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:26.590
to form free societies or whether that has to come from,
as you know,

434
00:25:26.591 --> 00:25:30.130
Shapiro calls it an unmoved mover or from some other belief in something that

435
00:25:30.131 --> 00:25:33.850
basically I had a conversation with Michael Shermer and Dennis Prager on my show

436
00:25:33.851 --> 00:25:37.870
about this,
about God and morality and Dennis's position.
Dennis,
of course,

437
00:25:37.871 --> 00:25:41.380
as a believer,
Dennis's position is that on a micro level,

438
00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:44.350
any of us can be good without God.
That we can,

439
00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:49.090
we can choose good things and be moral,
etc. But that on a macro level,

440
00:25:49.091 --> 00:25:52.660
a society can't without God.
Now obviously my,
uh,

441
00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:56.000
Michael Shermer takes the opposite position,
which is where you are.
Yeah.
Um,

442
00:25:56.050 --> 00:25:57.310
but can you talk about that a little bit?

443
00:25:57.570 --> 00:26:00.800
<v 2>Sure.
And,
and let me just say before I talk about even that,
that,</v>

444
00:26:00.801 --> 00:26:03.630
that Michael Show him and I are going to disagree about what more reality is.

445
00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:06.030
We're going to agree that you can add morality without God,

446
00:26:06.031 --> 00:26:09.990
but we'll get to disagree about what morality is.
And even this issue or reason,

447
00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:11.160
Sam Harrison,

448
00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:14.060
I might disagree on what we use in is right and what it really means.

449
00:26:14.061 --> 00:26:16.290
So there's a lot of juicy,

450
00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:20.580
interesting philosophical discussions to be had.
Yeah,
I mean you would say,
um,

451
00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:23.530
we do incentives like three,
you guys disagree on free will,

452
00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:26.280
which is what you can't have reason without flew in my view.

453
00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:28.740
So he's talking about reason.
What does even mean if you,

454
00:26:28.741 --> 00:26:31.230
if you're not even making choices,
if it's not you making choices,

455
00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:34.650
if you just an automaton.
So if you disagree,
if you will,

456
00:26:34.651 --> 00:26:37.740
you disagree really about everything.
But that's,

457
00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:41.540
that's to me where the juice is,
where the real interesting discussion is.

458
00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:43.380
And I think what the left the,

459
00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:48.240
the nanny left has done is it's excluded itself from even this debate because it

460
00:26:48.241 --> 00:26:52.110
won't even engaged,
right?
They just yell and scream and shout.

461
00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:55.380
But the interesting debate is happening can happen,

462
00:26:55.381 --> 00:27:00.150
should happen between Jordan Peterson,
between,
uh,
Sam House,
myself,

463
00:27:00.151 --> 00:27:00.984
the Weinsteins.

464
00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:04.860
These are the people who should be having this debate because there's wheel

465
00:27:04.861 --> 00:27:08.490
philosophical issues to be worked out,
right.
To be understood,
to be discovered,

466
00:27:08.491 --> 00:27:13.440
to,
to be,
to be figured out.
It's not simple.
It's not straightforward.
Now,

467
00:27:13.441 --> 00:27:16.080
the idea that morality,

468
00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:20.250
reality is the code by which to live your life by which to make important

469
00:27:20.251 --> 00:27:24.930
decisions in your life.
Right.
To,
to,
to know what is good and what is bad,

470
00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:27.030
what is the white path and what is the wrong lens.

471
00:27:27.450 --> 00:27:32.450
The ideas that is dependent on something written in some ancient book or is

472
00:27:33.901 --> 00:27:38.220
dependent on some person's ability to commune with spirits,

473
00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:42.900
right?
Which is basically what religion demands.

474
00:27:42.901 --> 00:27:45.990
Either you believe in some book or you commune with spirits and get information

475
00:27:45.991 --> 00:27:50.130
directly,
or you have an intermediary who communes with the spirits and get,

476
00:27:50.131 --> 00:27:53.880
but even when I say it,
it sounds so ridiculous.
It's,
it's hard to take seriously.

477
00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:57.330
But
you know,
so,

478
00:27:57.331 --> 00:28:01.140
so if I don't believe in the spirits and I don't believe in this ancient book,

479
00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:03.420
I can't make proper decisions about my own life.

480
00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:07.740
Now Take Dennis Prager's argument that yeah,
you can,
you can.

481
00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:12.270
But as a society we can,
what does that mean?
That means that most of you can't.

482
00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:16.110
It means the most of you are too stupid to take care of yourself.

483
00:28:16.410 --> 00:28:20.220
Most of you are too stupid to understand what right and wrong is what's good for

484
00:28:20.221 --> 00:28:23.580
your life,
what's bad for your life,
what will lead to the horrible consequences,

485
00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:26.460
what will lead to good consequences and therefore we use,

486
00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:31.470
we had to sell you a story about fairies and gremlins and,

487
00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:31.890
and,

488
00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:36.570
and stuff in order for you to be moral in order for you.

489
00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:39.960
And now that to me is absurd.

490
00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:44.640
Morality is about figuring out,
and this is where funnily enough,
Sam House and I,

491
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.860
at least on the approach,
agree,

492
00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:52.280
morality is about looking out at the world and empirically figuring out what is

493
00:28:52.531 --> 00:28:57.510
good for human beings and what is bad,
what leads to flourishing and success.

494
00:28:57.511 --> 00:29:01.980
And what leads to the destruction,
death,
disease and starvation.
Right?

495
00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:06.720
That's what [inaudible] and then do the things that lead to success and avoid

496
00:29:06.721 --> 00:29:10.440
the things that lead to death and destruction,
not that hot right now.

497
00:29:10.441 --> 00:29:12.690
It's a little bit more complicated than that.
It a little harder than that.

498
00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:17.250
But basically that's the,
that's the chore that Your Ethics Department,

499
00:29:17.251 --> 00:29:19.230
if you have philosophy department,
your,
your ethicists.

500
00:29:19.231 --> 00:29:22.800
Should we be thinking about what are they actions,

501
00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:27.090
the values that people should pursue that lead to success in life,

502
00:29:27.091 --> 00:29:29.800
that lead to flushing to happiness to just a,

503
00:29:29.801 --> 00:29:34.600
a sense of what being about the world and what are the actions and sense where

504
00:29:34.601 --> 00:29:39.380
all of the same species.
But most of the time I'll take that.
Yeah.

505
00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:43.360
Most of the time,
um,
you know,
if you eat,

506
00:29:43.361 --> 00:29:46.020
if all of us eat cyanide,
we pretty much all die.
Right?

507
00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:49.660
The sudden we've got a great ending of this show,
by the way,

508
00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:53.830
just stay tuned for that guy.
And they claimed who wrote colts.

509
00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:58.030
I really trying to Max out the youtube views,
you know what I mean?

510
00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:03.680
We have our particular nature.
So just like wave up,

511
00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:08.270
particularly in HR in the material sense it.
So if you take a knife,
you know,

512
00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:13.840
I'm just waiting for Dave.
Yeah,
some things have certain impacts.

513
00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:17.410
The same thing in the spiritual realm.
If I lie all the time,

514
00:30:17.411 --> 00:30:20.500
it has a certain impact on my life.
Not a good one.

515
00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:25.780
So it's pretty easy if you're a kid and experiment a little bit of lying and

516
00:30:25.781 --> 00:30:29.830
test it out a little bit to figure out like not a good strategy in life.

517
00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:33.130
If you want to make friends and make money and be successful.

518
00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:38.280
Only profession in the old universe we lying actually leads to success is,

519
00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:43.840
yeah.
And that's why,
who cares about politics?
Boring,
stupid subject.

520
00:30:44.390 --> 00:30:47.740
But everything.
And I always say,
have you ever met,

521
00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:51.280
have you ever met a happy,
flourishing?

522
00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:56.290
Really a politician who you go,
wow,
what a life this person lives.

523
00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:00.880
Oh God.
Oh my God.
No.

524
00:31:00.881 --> 00:31:05.260
The whole Bush clan looks like miserable,
pathetic human being.
I mean the last,

525
00:31:05.890 --> 00:31:10.330
the last guy who gave you that sense of probably George Washington,
right?

526
00:31:10.570 --> 00:31:13.720
And or I mean,
I can't think of it.
Look at,
look at the Clintons.

527
00:31:13.721 --> 00:31:18.190
I mean they look like they want to slit their wrists.
I mean,

528
00:31:18.490 --> 00:31:23.140
so the,
the,
the idea is let's go out there.

529
00:31:23.170 --> 00:31:24.610
This is what morality should do.

530
00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:28.330
Let's go out there and figure out what leads to human success with two leads to

531
00:31:28.331 --> 00:31:31.930
individual human success and do that.
And that's what morality is.

532
00:31:31.931 --> 00:31:35.170
Morality is not some mystical,
crazy,

533
00:31:35.171 --> 00:31:39.450
strange science that we have to commune with the spirits and or to figure out,

534
00:31:39.451 --> 00:31:44.260
no,
it's an empirical science.
Just like any other sites.
What succeeds?
What fails?

535
00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:48.370
Let's do the stuff to succeed and don't do the stuff that fails.
That's it.

536
00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:50.550
So No,
you,
you,
you,
and,

537
00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:55.390
and succeed means live well and live wall means longterm.

538
00:31:55.391 --> 00:31:58.560
Cause you know,
Ben is going to come in and say,
what about the chicken?
The ball,

539
00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:02.800
you really want the chicken,
the ball,
right?
I mean he did that on your show.
Like,

540
00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:04.510
no,
I don't really want the chicken,

541
00:32:04.511 --> 00:32:08.530
the bar because I know the consequences of the chick at the bar.
So it never,

542
00:32:08.531 --> 00:32:10.900
it never really enters my mind,
right.

543
00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:15.100
Because I love my wife and I want to stay with her.
And this is stupid,
right?

544
00:32:15.130 --> 00:32:18.130
So there is no short term self into short term as a whim.

545
00:32:18.131 --> 00:32:21.790
Worshiping going by your emotion is anti self interest.

546
00:32:21.791 --> 00:32:25.670
It's an type model.
It's a model.
So don't do it.
No.

547
00:32:25.671 --> 00:32:27.880
So no,
I,

548
00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:31.780
I in the flip side is that what is religious morality?

549
00:32:32.890 --> 00:32:35.980
It's whatever somebody's,
you know,
made up,

550
00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:41.390
it's unconnected to reality.
It's nonscientific,
it's made up stuff.

551
00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:46.550
Um,
and it,
it's completely subjective and it means actually nothing.
It's,

552
00:32:46.551 --> 00:32:51.290
it's the least objective morality possible because it's,
it's,

553
00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:55.370
you know,
this is why,
how many sex or Protestants in ism audit?

554
00:32:56.010 --> 00:32:59.160
Like I dunno,
100,
200,000,
right?

555
00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:03.200
Because they don't feel like following that commandment and they go into it,

556
00:33:03.201 --> 00:33:04.100
not something else.
Right.

557
00:33:04.101 --> 00:33:06.860
They start to one sec where you allowed to do that thing,
right?

558
00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:10.700
If you put a 50 rabbis in a room to study a particular paragraph,

559
00:33:10.701 --> 00:33:14.220
how many opinions are going to have on that paragraph?
51 at least.
Yeah.

560
00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:16.490
So you know,

561
00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:21.960
where's the objective nature of morality coming out of this experience?

562
00:33:22.341 --> 00:33:22.581
No.

563
00:33:22.581 --> 00:33:27.581
The only objective morality isn't a morality that is derived from real reality,

564
00:33:28.791 --> 00:33:32.030
from from the world out there scientifically,
right?
It's science.

565
00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:33.170
So what I love about these kinds of

566
00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:36.590
<v 3>is that all of the people that you just mentioned that we've been talking about,</v>

567
00:33:36.591 --> 00:33:38.840
that I know you guys follow and listen to the podcast and things.

568
00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:44.060
These people are actually friends and,
and,
and truly comrades.

569
00:33:44.061 --> 00:33:45.230
I know a bad word for it,

570
00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:49.570
<v 2>group of freedom lovers here.
How am I in the best sense of comrade,
but,</v>

571
00:33:49.571 --> 00:33:50.404
but the fact that

572
00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:54.020
<v 3>these people,
whether it's Dennis or Michael or whoever,</v>

573
00:33:54.290 --> 00:33:57.740
that at the end of the day,
whatever those differences are,

574
00:33:57.741 --> 00:34:01.370
we're actually relishing those differences at the moment.
I mean,
we really are.

575
00:34:01.371 --> 00:34:03.500
And I think that that's what's driving people to us,

576
00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:07.250
that this endless hysteria has now driven people.

577
00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:09.710
I would have never made sense to me.
Well,

578
00:34:09.711 --> 00:34:13.760
but five years ago before I really was doing this version of what I'm doing,

579
00:34:13.890 --> 00:34:18.770
that at all I would be talking about every day is that you should live life
free.

580
00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:23.030
And once,
once that hit me,
once I really had that revelation,

581
00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:25.130
well then it did change a lot of my politics.

582
00:34:25.131 --> 00:34:27.920
And I know you think the politics part are the,
are the boring part of this,

583
00:34:27.921 --> 00:34:32.600
but it led me to now being for free markets and some of those other libertarian

584
00:34:32.601 --> 00:34:33.470
and classical liberal,

585
00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:34.740
<v 2>cause you know,
I think that's right.</v>

586
00:34:34.741 --> 00:34:38.370
But I think this is the kind of debate that needs to happen,
right?

587
00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:42.420
They kind of philosophically deep debate about these issues that matter and you

588
00:34:42.421 --> 00:34:46.260
can have this debate and still be respectful and totally specked out of sight.

589
00:34:46.261 --> 00:34:50.370
This is not easy stuff.
It's not obvious.
Right?
And,
and it's,

590
00:34:50.371 --> 00:34:55.260
it's interesting and engaging to have the debate and the discussion and I think

591
00:34:55.261 --> 00:34:58.920
that's what you're facilitating what you're facilitating is really the creation

592
00:34:58.921 --> 00:35:03.060
of why this movement is kind of building around Dave Wright is because David's

593
00:35:03.061 --> 00:35:07.910
facilitating a conversation and would,
would,
uh,
would I inventure pure,

594
00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:11.370
we'll have a conversation independent of Dave.
I don't think so.
Right?

595
00:35:11.371 --> 00:35:15.930
I mean there's a certain or Bret Weinstein because we come from things.

596
00:35:15.931 --> 00:35:17.910
So definitely,
but the conversation,

597
00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:21.060
I don't think we're going to convince each other.
I never go into debate thing.

598
00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:23.490
Can we get convinced the other guy never know,
even if,

599
00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:27.420
but you guys are going to benefit immensely from it and,
and uh,

600
00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:31.530
thousands of other people are going to benefit immensely from hearing two

601
00:35:31.531 --> 00:35:32.970
intelligent people who disagree.

602
00:35:32.971 --> 00:35:37.590
Talk about a topic that's important in a respectful,
you know,

603
00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:41.940
rational way the world benefits from it.
Even if we don't,

604
00:35:42.090 --> 00:35:46.950
we're not again,
with,
most of us are too old to,
to,
to really change these,

605
00:35:46.951 --> 00:35:49.560
the,
these ideas and we're two fixing our ways.

606
00:35:49.770 --> 00:35:54.600
But the conversation is fascinating and benefits all of the people who listened

607
00:35:54.601 --> 00:35:55.030
to it.

608
00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:58.020
<v 1>Yeah.
So that,
that's why I love,
that's why I love coming to colleges.</v>

609
00:35:58.030 --> 00:36:01.090
I mean the fact that you guys care about this stuff is amazing to me.
I mean,

610
00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:04.600
I'm not that much older than you.
I'm a little,
little.

611
00:36:04.601 --> 00:36:09.520
I was in college in [inaudible] 94 to 98.
Um,
I'm 41.
I spent four years in Logan.

612
00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:13.240
Paul,
they won't even bore you guys.
What year are we?
Most of you guys born,

613
00:36:15.870 --> 00:36:20.320
oh go fuck yourself.
This is so great.

614
00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:23.260
This is why I stopped being a professor.
You see,

615
00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:27.040
the thing that sucks most about being a professors,

616
00:36:27.130 --> 00:36:32.130
every year your students get younger [inaudible] you are young Jesus.

617
00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:35.170
Um,
yeah but I spent,

618
00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:38.470
I spent four years in college smoking pot and playing Sega Genesis,

619
00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:41.420
but libertarian,
there's always saying,

620
00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:46.480
I can't tell if you're just applaud everything or the choice things,

621
00:36:46.481 --> 00:36:49.630
but either way.
But the fact that people are at college and coming back

622
00:36:49.650 --> 00:36:52.080
<v 3>to events like this and thinking about these things,
it's kind of beautiful.</v>

623
00:36:52.081 --> 00:36:52.381
But let,

624
00:36:52.381 --> 00:36:56.520
let's move to a little bit of the political stuff because we were going to talk

625
00:36:56.521 --> 00:36:57.510
about free markets a little bit.

626
00:36:57.511 --> 00:36:59.910
Cause that's one of the things that I definitely have changed.
And you know,

627
00:36:59.911 --> 00:37:04.290
most of my liberal beliefs about living let live and especially on the social

628
00:37:04.291 --> 00:37:06.940
things that,
you know,
gay marriage of course,
and,
and you know,

629
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:09.600
you should be able to drink whatever you want,
smoke,
whatever you want.

630
00:37:09.601 --> 00:37:13.710
And the rest of that,
that has not shifted.
But I definitely have shifted as I've,

631
00:37:13.890 --> 00:37:18.060
as I've come to this world and had these discussions,
I definitely have shifted.

632
00:37:18.061 --> 00:37:18.451
Right?

633
00:37:18.451 --> 00:37:23.451
I would say economically because I've realized that you should keep more of what

634
00:37:23.791 --> 00:37:26.010
you earn so you can do what you want with it,

635
00:37:26.011 --> 00:37:30.480
whether it's spend it on yourself or donate it to causes that you believe in,

636
00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:32.550
that the government basically is,

637
00:37:32.610 --> 00:37:37.610
especially the federal government is just this monster that is constantly

638
00:37:38.011 --> 00:37:39.750
wanting more and you know,

639
00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:43.320
look how pissed all the Trump people were when he signed this omnibus package

640
00:37:43.321 --> 00:37:46.410
because he came in and said,
we're going to drain the swamp.
And what did he do?

641
00:37:46.411 --> 00:37:50.520
He signed the same old thing that funds planned parenthood and a bunch of other

642
00:37:50.521 --> 00:37:52.590
things that he's based hates.
So the government,

643
00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:55.590
the federal government especially just keeps growing and growing and growing.

644
00:37:55.591 --> 00:37:58.850
I told you about the obscene check that I wrote is living in California.
That's,

645
00:37:58.910 --> 00:38:01.140
that's at the state level of course.
Um,

646
00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:04.890
but I think it's interesting that once you get the ideas of freedom,

647
00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:09.450
it's pretty obvious that it's completely linked to how your economics will

648
00:38:09.451 --> 00:38:10.270
change as well.

649
00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:10.991
<v 2>It is.
I mean,</v>

650
00:38:10.991 --> 00:38:15.991
at the end of the day you should have the power to make decisions about your

651
00:38:16.811 --> 00:38:21.450
life,
right?
But if you're,
if you're in California and you,

652
00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:24.430
you pour and you're trying to break through,
you know,

653
00:38:24.431 --> 00:38:29.170
you have to spend like 2000 bucks to get a license to shampoo head.
Right?
I mean,

654
00:38:29.171 --> 00:38:31.480
that's insane.
You have to open up,

655
00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:36.500
you have to get a $20,000 government program to open a nail salon.

656
00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:39.140
It because you know,

657
00:38:39.210 --> 00:38:42.490
they all going to be affected with that fungus and we're all gonna,
you know,

658
00:38:42.491 --> 00:38:44.560
it's just the government needs to protect us.
Otherwise,

659
00:38:44.810 --> 00:38:48.160
what will happen in the Nail Salon?
What would you say to them?

660
00:38:48.170 --> 00:38:51.860
<v 3>People that say that,
well wait a minute.
If we left everything to be unregulated,</v>

661
00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:52.791
that you know,

662
00:38:52.791 --> 00:38:56.120
the Nail Salon would be dumping the stuff in the river and all just all this

663
00:38:56.121 --> 00:38:58.430
sort of hysteria on this,
that the government is the,

664
00:38:58.431 --> 00:39:03.431
is the unit that has to come in and make sure that people aren't killing each

665
00:39:03.621 --> 00:39:05.310
other and infecting each other in a whole bunch of them.

666
00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:08.260
<v 2>Then it is hysteria that it's nothing more than that.</v>

667
00:39:08.261 --> 00:39:12.520
And it's based on history that is told from an historical perspective.

668
00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:13.870
That's not true history.

669
00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:17.860
The fact is the markets are brilliant and beautiful and regulating themselves.

670
00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:23.130
And can I articulate for you the solution to every one of these problems that

671
00:39:23.171 --> 00:39:24.220
exist in the market?
No,

672
00:39:24.221 --> 00:39:28.030
because the market usually comes up with solutions that I could never imagine.

673
00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:33.120
But the fact is I was,
I've listened,
I listened to NPR,
I admit it.
Wow.
You know,

674
00:39:33.130 --> 00:39:37.450
guilty as charged,
but it,
I'll be up,
er,
when I lived in California,

675
00:39:37.451 --> 00:39:40.140
I'll tell you why I live now in a minute,
but when I lived in California,

676
00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:43.150
was writing those very large checks to the government.
Um,
I,

677
00:39:43.151 --> 00:39:46.840
you still listen to NPR and he used to run these stories about farming and about

678
00:39:46.841 --> 00:39:49.330
food safety because food safety is a big deal in California.

679
00:39:49.690 --> 00:39:53.380
And they used to interview the farmers and without NPR really realizing what

680
00:39:53.381 --> 00:39:56.500
they were doing,
the farmers would basically say,
look,

681
00:39:56.910 --> 00:40:00.760
the the people who come here from the FDA,
we can manage them.

682
00:40:00.761 --> 00:40:01.830
That's not really a problem.

683
00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:06.850
It's those guys from the supermarkets who come and inspect our food.

684
00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:12.280
They're really difficult,
right?
It's really hard to get by them,
right?

685
00:40:12.310 --> 00:40:14.950
So who has an incentive to make sure your food is safe?

686
00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:19.660
Mcdonald's does this supermarket does the restaurant selling you the food does

687
00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:21.820
not.
Some lazy,
Lazy,

688
00:40:21.970 --> 00:40:26.050
whatever bureaucrat who's not going to lose this job if these e coli in the

689
00:40:26.051 --> 00:40:30.670
salad because he's a government employee and can't lose his job.
But believe me,

690
00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:35.250
if that was a private contractor that supervised the salad and it got equally,

691
00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:36.640
they are gonna lose their job,

692
00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:40.330
the restaurant might lose millions of customers and go out of business.

693
00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:45.600
There's real consequences in the real world if something goes wrong.

694
00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:48.520
And people,
sorry.
I often say,
you know,

695
00:40:48.521 --> 00:40:51.760
I walk into the elevators anywhere in the United States and you've got a little

696
00:40:51.761 --> 00:40:54.520
diploma on the wall and it says,
uh,
uh,

697
00:40:54.521 --> 00:40:58.360
government supervisor supervise this elevator and it will not fall.

698
00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:02.110
You will not die.
Don't worry.
Because we know,
right?
We know.

699
00:41:02.111 --> 00:41:04.240
All of us know that if not for the government,

700
00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:07.630
elevators would be falling all across America telling.

701
00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:12.340
But we laugh at everybody laughs when I say that,
but we really believe that.

702
00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:14.080
I mean really believe that,
right?

703
00:41:14.081 --> 00:41:18.920
Anybody here who considers himself anything short of a true free market or

704
00:41:18.921 --> 00:41:22.270
believes that because you believe in regulations and all regulations are based

705
00:41:22.271 --> 00:41:23.680
on that assumption,
right?

706
00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:28.650
Mcdonald's the way if you live mcdonalds completely unleashed,
right?

707
00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:33.860
They would basically sell you tainted meat because the best to make monies to

708
00:41:33.861 --> 00:41:37.370
kill your customers.
Now,
I mean,

709
00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:41.450
and the best way to run a nail salon is decreed fungus on the nails or whatever

710
00:41:41.570 --> 00:41:43.340
it is that the danger is and they also,

711
00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:47.870
I mean that is bizarre and that's not to live in the real world with business

712
00:41:47.871 --> 00:41:52.871
people are the most diligent people in the world to try to make sure that the

713
00:41:53.570 --> 00:41:54.950
businesses are safe,
that they,

714
00:41:54.951 --> 00:41:59.390
that they're selling a good product and knows who are not get,
get,

715
00:41:59.391 --> 00:42:03.140
go out of business very quickly and get it eliminated by the marketplace very

716
00:42:03.141 --> 00:42:06.470
quickly.
And Yeah,
the free market is riskier,

717
00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:10.040
is risky or they are risks in a free market.
There is noise in a free market.

718
00:42:10.090 --> 00:42:11.540
It's ups and downs.
In a free market.

719
00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:16.400
In a sense it's riskier than a controlled market,
but the controlled market,

720
00:42:16.401 --> 00:42:20.750
the real risk of a control market is it goes,
no way.
You can't live.

721
00:42:21.010 --> 00:42:25.640
You get told what to do,
what to buy,
what to eat,
what to drink,
how to live.

722
00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:29.330
And if you're,
and this is the thing I ask liberals,
right?

723
00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:33.020
If you don't think other people should have a say in who you sleep with,

724
00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:37.850
then how can other people,
how should other people have a say in what you sell?

725
00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:40.400
Uh,
how,
how is it that other people should,

726
00:42:40.401 --> 00:42:45.320
have you seen how you sell it or what did it makes business different than any

727
00:42:45.321 --> 00:42:48.020
other activity in life that you think should be free?

728
00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:49.980
What is it about money that,

729
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:55.000
that suddenly other people get a say in how you do your own business and,

730
00:42:55.071 --> 00:42:59.300
and you know,
it is,
it's,
it's the,
the,
the,

731
00:42:59.330 --> 00:43:03.200
the left is,
is fundamentally Marxist there materialists.

732
00:43:03.410 --> 00:43:05.430
So what they really care about what any,

733
00:43:05.450 --> 00:43:07.550
and I see this in debates when I do about inequality,

734
00:43:07.850 --> 00:43:10.940
what they really care about is money.
See,
I don't care that much about money.

735
00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:12.230
They really care about money.

736
00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:17.060
So what they want is their money and they want to redistribute it and they want

737
00:43:17.061 --> 00:43:19.010
to take it and they want to decide where it goes.

738
00:43:19.070 --> 00:43:21.590
They don't care about the spiritual stuff.
They don't care about sex.

739
00:43:21.591 --> 00:43:22.640
I don't care about all that stuff.

740
00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:24.740
That's why you can do whatever you want with that.

741
00:43:24.741 --> 00:43:29.570
You can live your own life there with the right cares about the spiritual stuff

742
00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:33.140
right there.
They come from religion with spiritual is important.

743
00:43:33.350 --> 00:43:35.630
So that's what they want to regulate.
That's what they want to control.

744
00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:37.100
That's what they want to tell you how to live,

745
00:43:37.310 --> 00:43:39.590
but they don't really care about money,
money,
the spiritual,

746
00:43:39.591 --> 00:43:41.990
so they don't really care about money that much so that you could do whatever

747
00:43:41.991 --> 00:43:46.520
the hell you want with.
Right.
So I say no.
I care about both.

748
00:43:46.521 --> 00:43:47.390
I care about the spiritual,

749
00:43:47.391 --> 00:43:52.370
I give out the material and I want to be able to make my own decisions about

750
00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:56.750
both.
And it's none of your business.
If I go bankrupt,
it's none of your business.

751
00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:00.780
If I,
if I commit,
I don't know why we going to suicide today.
I'm on suicide,

752
00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:05.990
suicide watch.
If somebody commits suicide,
it's none of anybody's business.

753
00:44:05.991 --> 00:44:10.010
What I do with my life,
my life is mine.

754
00:44:10.310 --> 00:44:13.490
And then people say,
well,
what about the poor?
And I'm tempted,

755
00:44:13.491 --> 00:44:16.220
right always to say to somebody like that,
why do you care?

756
00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:20.480
Because I really want to know,
why do you care now I care about the poor.

757
00:44:20.481 --> 00:44:23.030
At least I care about some point.
I don't care about all the pillow,

758
00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:27.110
but I want to know why is it that the first response I get from any audience,

759
00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:31.980
what about the poor,
right?
What is it?
What triggers that right?
A,

760
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:34.260
you assuming the poor can't take care of themselves.
I don't,

761
00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:36.540
I assume they're just as human as anybody else.

762
00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:39.900
They have the capacity of your work.
They have capacity to produce.
Actually,

763
00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:44.220
if you let them free,
they can become anything they want to become.
Right.

764
00:44:44.221 --> 00:44:48.150
Then there are no limitations.
Um,
and,
and in free economies,

765
00:44:48.151 --> 00:44:50.160
the poor rise up and,
and they do very well.

766
00:44:50.161 --> 00:44:53.280
I needed the only place where poor whites up as in free condoms.

767
00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:58.530
Why do you care how many people really can't take care of themselves?

768
00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:02.400
Really can't find a job,
can never do any of that stuff.
How many people?

769
00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:04.120
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

770
00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:07.540
<v 2>really can't and let you know cannot and they don't have any family members to</v>

771
00:45:07.541 --> 00:45:10.060
take care of them and they don't have any friends to take care of them.

772
00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:13.960
They really destitute and nobody's there to help them.

773
00:45:13.961 --> 00:45:17.050
How many people like that all day in the world or in America?

774
00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:21.250
I mean how many,
what's the percentage?
Give me a percentage

775
00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:26.280
<v 4>during
the military.</v>

776
00:45:26.281 --> 00:45:29.330
Does a lot of people on bad,
right?
You made it through.
Yeah.

777
00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:35.170
<v 2>Yeah.
So I know a lot of people in that 10% of the bottom population,
they can,</v>

778
00:45:35.230 --> 00:45:37.780
they can do stuff.
I can't do I,
you know,

779
00:45:37.781 --> 00:45:40.090
I was watching this guy clean my windows.

780
00:45:40.091 --> 00:45:43.570
We watch watching today at I high rise here in Chicago,
cleaning the window,

781
00:45:43.571 --> 00:45:47.100
sitting there,
cleaning the window.
Right.
You don't need a high Iq for them.

782
00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:48.220
But you know what?
I couldn't do it.

783
00:45:48.730 --> 00:45:50.830
You put me anywhere close to that thing and I'll,

784
00:45:50.831 --> 00:45:55.540
I'll run for our run for the hills despite its apparent death wish today.
Yeah.

785
00:45:55.570 --> 00:46:00.400
Um,
so I,
I disagree with Jordan on that.

786
00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:02.500
The bottom tier and Billy,
I was in the army,

787
00:46:02.590 --> 00:46:04.030
I was in the military and believe me,

788
00:46:04.031 --> 00:46:08.710
these Railey military did not exclude the bottom 10% of the distribution.

789
00:46:10.030 --> 00:46:11.800
I was with them in a tank.

790
00:46:13.150 --> 00:46:17.110
And I know this is real life,
right?

791
00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:19.960
I mean the dumbest I met in these,
in the army,

792
00:46:19.961 --> 00:46:24.600
I met the dumbest people I've ever met in my life.
I mean really,
really low Iq.

793
00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:29.440
But where they decent people absolute could they function?
Absolutely.

794
00:46:29.650 --> 00:46:32.560
Could they function in a,
in a combat?
Absolutely.

795
00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:37.630
So I I that that the fact that the American military can have whatsapp,

796
00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:42.060
they can clean the windows.
You just use the [inaudible].
We'll,

797
00:46:42.090 --> 00:46:43.400
we'll pick it up at the,
I don't know,

798
00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:47.860
but I'm saying that they can clean the windows.
They get plenty of jobs.

799
00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:52.180
There are plenty of jobs for people who can't do what at that level and they do

800
00:46:52.181 --> 00:46:52.870
the jobs.

801
00:46:52.870 --> 00:46:56.140
There are plenty of people with an Iq of under whatever number you want.

802
00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:59.290
I Know People Down Syndrome who beg,

803
00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:03.130
you know who go to work and I'm making a living,
right?

804
00:47:03.310 --> 00:47:08.310
So the percentage of people who truly cannot take care of themselves is under

805
00:47:08.741 --> 00:47:12.340
well on the 1% and then the question to any audiences,

806
00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:15.850
and then now we're talking about that's under 1% now how many of those don't

807
00:47:15.851 --> 00:47:18.040
have family and don't have friends who could take care of them?

808
00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:21.220
That's even smaller percentage.
And then I asked every audience in the world,

809
00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:25.390
how many of you are willing to put a little bit of money into a pot in order to

810
00:47:25.391 --> 00:47:27.900
help that fraction of 1% of people?

811
00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:31.720
Really Tana take care of themselves under any circumstances.

812
00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:35.410
And everybody in the room raises their hand.
So what's the,
what do I need?

813
00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:40.440
Some government bureaucracy with 50,000 different programs employing hundreds of

814
00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:43.750
thousands of people,
institutionalizing people,

815
00:47:43.751 --> 00:47:45.820
convincing people that they can't take care of them.

816
00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:46.470
<v 3>Yeah.
Well,
let's,</v>

817
00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:49.350
let's sit there for a second because I think this is interesting because even if

818
00:47:49.351 --> 00:47:53.340
the number,
let,
let's say your numbers are off,
let's just say it was 5%,
right,

819
00:47:53.341 --> 00:47:58.341
so I'm more than tripling the numbers that you're talking about that if people

820
00:47:59.130 --> 00:48:03.690
were given back more of their money because we're funding all of these absurdly

821
00:48:03.691 --> 00:48:06.930
ridiculous,
uh,
bureaucratic monstrosities,

822
00:48:06.931 --> 00:48:09.240
if people were given back some of that money,

823
00:48:09.450 --> 00:48:11.640
if you actually care about poor people,

824
00:48:11.641 --> 00:48:14.430
and I do believe that you can ask the question,
well why do you,

825
00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:16.890
but I do believe people want to do good.

826
00:48:16.891 --> 00:48:21.420
But if you had more money in your pocket and you knew that the government was

827
00:48:21.421 --> 00:48:26.070
not going to take care of those people,
then I do think people would give more.

828
00:48:26.071 --> 00:48:29.520
And I,
I also see this with,
you know,
something like planned parenthood,

829
00:48:29.521 --> 00:48:33.150
which in and of itself I don't have a,
a great issue with.
Um,

830
00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:36.270
but there is a certain amount of people in the United States that are against

831
00:48:36.271 --> 00:48:39.420
them providing abortions.
And I get it.
It's a small percentage of what they do.

832
00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:42.390
But if the government was to not fund planned parenthood,

833
00:48:42.391 --> 00:48:43.590
which I wouldn't have a problem with,

834
00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:48.570
wouldn't all of these celebrities that are constantly talking about all the

835
00:48:48.571 --> 00:48:51.330
great things about planned parenthood,
all of these people with money,

836
00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:54.540
if you're not changing the laws,
wouldn't they put more money in?

837
00:48:54.541 --> 00:48:58.650
And this is where,
this is where it does come down to personal responsibility.

838
00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:03.600
You can make the world you want with your own money in your own resources and

839
00:49:03.601 --> 00:49:06.840
skills and volunteering and the rest of it as opposed to just,

840
00:49:06.841 --> 00:49:09.690
I think what it is really,
I think the answer your question,
it's just laziness.

841
00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:10.553
It's,
it's just

842
00:49:10.810 --> 00:49:13.920
<v 2>just going,
ah,
you know what?
Let them take my money,
do whatever they want.</v>

843
00:49:13.921 --> 00:49:16.210
And they always have money for bombs,
but we don't have money for this.

844
00:49:16.211 --> 00:49:19.210
And I always find people say,
you know,
I would do it,

845
00:49:19.211 --> 00:49:22.750
but those today it wouldn't do it at all.
You know,
wouldn't do it.

846
00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:24.370
And if we have to force them,

847
00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:26.770
because we know it's the right thing to do at some all thing to do.

848
00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:31.570
But is it the right thing?
Is it a moral thing to do?
I mean,
charity is fine,

849
00:49:31.690 --> 00:49:33.880
but charity doesn't define what morality is.

850
00:49:33.881 --> 00:49:38.881
Chatty doesn't define being ball and taking care of the poor is not that.

851
00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:42.460
It's not that important.
It's not going to point to any of you.

852
00:49:42.490 --> 00:49:45.250
It's not that important to me.
Right.
Be Globally.
Right.

853
00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:49.660
Because the fact is I could write a big check right now and sent to to Africa

854
00:49:49.661 --> 00:49:51.100
and save a bunch of kids lives.

855
00:49:51.580 --> 00:49:56.110
I know that and I don't because the fact is it's not that important to me and

856
00:49:56.111 --> 00:49:58.870
I'm willing to say that it's not,
and it's not to you.
You're just,

857
00:49:58.871 --> 00:50:03.500
most of you just won't say it.
Right.
Because there's a kid dying every day in,

858
00:50:03.550 --> 00:50:08.530
in,
in Africa that you are not saving.
Right.
Think of it that way.
This is a,
uh,

859
00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:09.760
what's his name?
Peter Singer's.

860
00:50:09.970 --> 00:50:13.120
Peter Singer's a famous philosopher and this is the case he makes,

861
00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:16.090
he makes you should care because you should care about everybody.

862
00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:20.890
I don't care that much about everybody.
I can't.
The closer you are to me,

863
00:50:20.891 --> 00:50:23.140
the more care about you.
The further you are from me,

864
00:50:23.141 --> 00:50:26.680
the less I care about you because I care about myself.
Now again,

865
00:50:26.681 --> 00:50:30.140
I don't to live in a society,
you know,
in my society,
my particular society,

866
00:50:30.141 --> 00:50:31.040
my city or whatever,

867
00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:34.160
where people where I know people are dying because nobody's taking care of them.

868
00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:37.250
So I'm willing to give a little bit of charity to do that a little bit up to a

869
00:50:37.251 --> 00:50:41.750
point,
right?
But there's even another context that I think people have Vaidya

870
00:50:43.310 --> 00:50:47.780
we know the direct correlation between wealth creation and freedom.

871
00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:48.920
I mean,

872
00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:53.660
this is one of the real truism in economics that you cannot dispute,

873
00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:56.420
right?
It's,
it's in Steven Pinker's latest book,

874
00:50:56.421 --> 00:51:00.380
which you should really read because th th th the chapters about how good the

875
00:51:00.381 --> 00:51:04.250
world is,
just amazing and true,
right?
We know.
I mean,

876
00:51:04.251 --> 00:51:07.970
even Steven Peako comes from the left.
We'll say this is because of markets.

877
00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:10.040
There's not because of governor,
this is because of market rate.

878
00:51:10.550 --> 00:51:11.930
So we know the correlation.

879
00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:16.960
Imagine the United States with all the human resources we have in this country.

880
00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:21.860
If we had a flea market in this country,
I can't imagine how rich we would be.

881
00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:27.320
I mean we think we're rich cause we get an iPhone 11 next this year.

882
00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:30.080
Right?
I always been this out,
right.
I always have to write,

883
00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:32.840
cause I think this is the like my center of my universe.
Right.

884
00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:35.630
But if you do the math,

885
00:51:35.690 --> 00:51:39.920
if you just add like 2% of GDP growth over the last 20 years,
what,

886
00:51:39.921 --> 00:51:44.840
how Richard we would be,
we would be a like an iPhone a hundred
no,

887
00:51:44.841 --> 00:51:47.870
I mean it's,
it's hard to imagine if the United States and grown,

888
00:51:48.050 --> 00:51:50.960
I can't show you the exact numbers so I might be off a little bit,

889
00:51:50.961 --> 00:51:55.520
but like 1% GDP less from the beginning of the center of the 20th century until

890
00:51:55.521 --> 00:51:58.070
the end.
We would be today poorer than Mexico.

891
00:51:58.700 --> 00:52:02.630
1% compounded makes a huge difference.

892
00:52:03.020 --> 00:52:06.740
So if we had a free marketing and I'd states and we were growing at 5%,

893
00:52:06.741 --> 00:52:11.480
which I think is conservative in this country,
5% GDP,
we would be so rich.

894
00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:15.260
The issue of the poor would never come up because a,

895
00:52:15.261 --> 00:52:18.890
we could write big checks because we were so rich,
but B,
they will be,

896
00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:23.420
the amount of money we would pay to have our windows cleaned would be high

897
00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:25.040
because we could afford it.

898
00:52:25.790 --> 00:52:29.300
So everybody's standard of living would,
would,

899
00:52:29.301 --> 00:52:33.470
would rise up as it always does.
People talk about rising boats,
they do rise.

900
00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:37.770
People talk about trickle down economics.
I like to call it flood down economics.

901
00:52:37.771 --> 00:52:41.360
It's not trickle right.
Every,
every,

902
00:52:41.361 --> 00:52:43.070
every simple job that's out there is,

903
00:52:43.071 --> 00:52:48.050
is a consequence of an entrepreneur who created it every,
every,
uh,

904
00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:52.640
every time that somebody gets a gets a ways just because capital is being

905
00:52:52.641 --> 00:52:57.380
invested and productivity of Labor has gone up.
It's a flood down.
It's the,

906
00:52:57.381 --> 00:52:58.670
it's the,
it's the,
the,

907
00:52:58.671 --> 00:53:02.870
the capitalists and the entrepreneurs and the business leaders who create the

908
00:53:02.871 --> 00:53:05.750
jobs that create the economy,
who drive the economy.

909
00:53:06.140 --> 00:53:10.670
So if you set them free,
the amount of wealth we would have,

910
00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:14.720
the amount of prosperity we will be living under is unimaginable to anybody

911
00:53:14.721 --> 00:53:16.670
living today.
What's interesting about this,

912
00:53:16.671 --> 00:53:18.680
I'd like to shift this a little bit to technology,

913
00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:22.550
but I think it's a great segue to that because if you listen to all of the

914
00:53:22.551 --> 00:53:25.890
people right now,
mostly on the left and the,
and the Bernie of people,

915
00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:28.650
<v 3>you know,
they're talking about this $15 minimum wage.</v>

916
00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:33.390
We also are living in a time when robots are literally replacing humans.

917
00:53:33.391 --> 00:53:36.760
I mean,
I was at the airport in Seattle not too long ago and at the that,

918
00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:40.390
I forget if it's burger king or Mcdonald's instead of people they now have,

919
00:53:40.420 --> 00:53:43.410
and it's just a big iPad.
And I've seen that in some other places.

920
00:53:43.590 --> 00:53:48.030
So the more that we demand these businesses not have capacity over what their

921
00:53:48.031 --> 00:53:49.560
own business decisions are,

922
00:53:49.710 --> 00:53:52.440
the more we're not going to be able to give people decent jobs.

923
00:53:52.590 --> 00:53:54.720
And also the concept,
you know,
it's,
it's so interesting because Bernie,

924
00:53:54.721 --> 00:53:57.570
we'll talk about,
well,
$15 an hour isn't a living wage,

925
00:53:57.810 --> 00:54:01.370
but you don't want that many people to have those jobs.
You've got,

926
00:54:01.380 --> 00:54:05.580
that should be your entry job to go get some other job.
And also it's like,

927
00:54:05.581 --> 00:54:09.020
I know this and this is where my,
my values have collided with my,

928
00:54:09.050 --> 00:54:11.490
my own business is that right now we're,

929
00:54:11.491 --> 00:54:13.980
we're trying to expand the show and we're trying to figure out what we're going

930
00:54:13.981 --> 00:54:17.100
to do.
And I get,
I get hundreds of people offering to work for me for free.

931
00:54:17.101 --> 00:54:19.600
And I don't want,
I don't even want my interns for free.
I mean,
I,

932
00:54:19.601 --> 00:54:20.700
I want to pay people,

933
00:54:21.150 --> 00:54:24.900
but the idea that I would have to pay someone x amount,

934
00:54:24.930 --> 00:54:27.930
now I want to pay my guys more than $15 an hour and we're trying to figure out

935
00:54:27.931 --> 00:54:29.640
all sorts of things.
And we,
by the way,

936
00:54:29.641 --> 00:54:31.680
we pay 100% of my employees health insurance.

937
00:54:31.681 --> 00:54:35.210
If you're looking for another job that I could take care of it.
Um,

938
00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:37.890
but I'm not moving back to California here.

939
00:54:38.910 --> 00:54:41.260
I want to talk a little bit about California too,
but,

940
00:54:41.310 --> 00:54:44.520
but the idea that the government can manage these things that the,
I mean,

941
00:54:44.521 --> 00:54:47.950
Bernie has never created a job.
He's never created anything.
I,

942
00:54:47.951 --> 00:54:49.620
I think he has three or four houses.

943
00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:53.100
He doesn't let poor people live in those houses.
Uh,
you know,

944
00:54:53.101 --> 00:54:56.730
he's made a lot of money.
You off of being a government,

945
00:54:57.180 --> 00:55:00.750
being a senator for 30 years,
who pretty much done nothing.

946
00:55:00.751 --> 00:55:03.720
And if you really include cutting across the aisle and he's really done nothing

947
00:55:03.721 --> 00:55:06.900
but it all sounds good that that was the point that I'm trying to get ultimately

948
00:55:06.901 --> 00:55:11.880
adjust what you said about I don't care about poor people or it sounds it even

949
00:55:11.881 --> 00:55:14.520
to me sitting here,
it doesn't sound good.
Oh,
I know Ben.

950
00:55:14.521 --> 00:55:18.300
Bernie comes in and goes out $15.
Everyone's going to college,
blah,
blah,
blah.

951
00:55:18.330 --> 00:55:20.190
And it all kind of makes everyone feel good.

952
00:55:20.250 --> 00:55:21.260
<v 2>Yeah.
See I say that,</v>

953
00:55:21.261 --> 00:55:24.350
but I care about the poor much more than boody does because I want to create a

954
00:55:24.351 --> 00:55:28.280
system in which the poor an appboy anymore.
Nobody,
nobody should be poor.

955
00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:31.940
If we had a true free market,
nobody would be poor.
Right?

956
00:55:32.380 --> 00:55:36.530
<v 0>Uh,
and the fact is,</v>

957
00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:37.753
and again,

958
00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:41.540
<v 2>look at Steven Pinker's book.
The fact is that nobody in America today is poor.</v>

959
00:55:42.110 --> 00:55:46.970
If what poverty means what poor people middle class was a hundred years ago or

960
00:55:46.971 --> 00:55:48.470
what the rich was a hundred years ago.

961
00:55:49.130 --> 00:55:53.900
Rich people had read years ago lived worse off than poor people do today,
right?

962
00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:55.550
We have super computers in our pockets.

963
00:55:55.580 --> 00:55:59.280
Even poor people have super computers in their pockets.
That's stunning.
Right?

964
00:55:59.870 --> 00:56:04.160
But you said something kind of funny before,
right?
Nobody laughed because,
um,

965
00:56:05.380 --> 00:56:10.220
[inaudible] lots of taking people's jobs literally right now.

966
00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:13.310
That's funny because,
well,
let's,

967
00:56:13.311 --> 00:56:16.760
I'll be taking people's jobs to 200 years,
right?

968
00:56:16.820 --> 00:56:19.310
The first sewing machines to people's jobs.

969
00:56:19.580 --> 00:56:24.430
Every single piece of technology that is being introduced over the 200 years has

970
00:56:24.431 --> 00:56:28.840
taken people's jobs.
And what were the consequences?
Fewer or more jobs,

971
00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:33.610
not just a little bit more jobs.
I lot more jobs.

972
00:56:33.820 --> 00:56:37.750
We have a population today of 8 billion people on the planet.

973
00:56:37.930 --> 00:56:42.920
Let's assume that about 2 billion of them actually working in,
in,
in,
uh,

974
00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:46.020
I mean,
not subsistence farming actually working and the grownup,

975
00:56:46.060 --> 00:56:50.290
2 billion people looking in jobs,
what we call jobs,
right?

976
00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:53.020
We're talking about 200 years ago,

977
00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:56.320
the population of the world was less than half a billion.

978
00:56:57.460 --> 00:57:02.200
Almost all of them were subsistence farmers.
There were no jobs.

979
00:57:02.590 --> 00:57:06.610
Ever since.
We've introduced technology,
all that has happened.

980
00:57:06.670 --> 00:57:10.120
All that has happened is we've created more and more and more and more and more

981
00:57:10.150 --> 00:57:10.983
jobs.

982
00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:15.400
We've never had a period over the last 200 years where we got fewer jobs.

983
00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:19.900
There's always more because the population has just exploded over the last,
uh,

984
00:57:19.930 --> 00:57:22.600
over the last 200 years.
And yet everybody has a job.

985
00:57:22.900 --> 00:57:26.380
And indeed the free or the economy is the more jobs there are.

986
00:57:26.410 --> 00:57:30.280
Like the United States in the 19th century was absorbing massive quantities of

987
00:57:30.281 --> 00:57:34.690
immigrants.
And because the capitalism,
technology,
industrialization,

988
00:57:34.691 --> 00:57:38.710
robots create more jobs and they destroy it always,

989
00:57:39.250 --> 00:57:43.570
always.
So I don't,
I don't get what the,

990
00:57:43.571 --> 00:57:46.870
what people are worried about,
about robots.
Now.
Ask me what the jobs are,

991
00:57:46.871 --> 00:57:51.730
the future.
I don't know.
I mean,
I know a few that I would like,
like a push them,

992
00:57:51.731 --> 00:57:55.390
the suits,
the travels with you everywhere.
I'm starting to appreciate this,
uh,

993
00:57:55.391 --> 00:57:59.030
the find your travel schedule.
And I need something like that.
Yeah.
You know,

994
00:57:59.130 --> 00:58:04.100
maybe even you are my personal in the cities.
Yeah.
Talk about that later.

995
00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:08.170
He charges alive,
that expensive.

996
00:58:09.220 --> 00:58:12.220
So these not regulated by the government.
It's the whole freaking thing.

997
00:58:14.410 --> 00:58:16.560
No license,
no license.

998
00:58:17.050 --> 00:58:19.810
You're looking at an unlicensed on the sys up here.
People

999
00:58:25.590 --> 00:58:29.590
were already,
we'll get back to that in a moment.
All right.
So that's,
you know,

1000
00:58:29.591 --> 00:58:31.000
we've,
we've already done more than an hour.

1001
00:58:31.250 --> 00:58:32.420
<v 3>We,
it's really fine.</v>

1002
00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:35.470
I do want to get to Q and a because I always find that to actually where,

1003
00:58:35.500 --> 00:58:36.640
where we can kind of learn the most.

1004
00:58:36.641 --> 00:58:40.000
But I quickly want to just bring this back to technology in California because

1005
00:58:40.001 --> 00:58:42.790
you escaped California.
You couldn't take it anymore.

1006
00:58:42.791 --> 00:58:45.580
I was at Berkeley two weeks ago.
Uh,

1007
00:58:45.670 --> 00:58:48.280
I did an event with turning point and we,
uh,

1008
00:58:48.310 --> 00:58:52.420
we had dinner out in San Francisco that night and literally driving to Berkeley

1009
00:58:52.421 --> 00:58:55.840
from San Francisco.
There are tent cities all over the place.
I mean,
this is,

1010
00:58:55.841 --> 00:58:59.020
this is the progressive utopia,
right?
I mean the San Francisco,

1011
00:58:59.021 --> 00:59:02.530
this is the lefty and place that they want to model the rest of the country.

1012
00:59:02.531 --> 00:59:05.980
After there were 10 cities everywhere.
I saw,
I kid you not.

1013
00:59:05.981 --> 00:59:09.940
I saw a guy shooting up in an alley while we were taking a turn.
Um,

1014
00:59:10.030 --> 00:59:13.450
when we went to dinner and we were on a nice street,
we went to a steak house,

1015
00:59:13.690 --> 00:59:17.680
our car was parked outside,
the car was broken into and they stole my bag.

1016
00:59:17.860 --> 00:59:21.230
So there's some junky running around San Francisco in my underwear telling my

1017
00:59:21.231 --> 00:59:22.280
jokes cause my comedy,

1018
00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:24.470
<v 1>my comedy notebook was in there.</v>

1019
00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:28.910
I can picture some guy who tends to be going on and on about the regressive
left.

1020
00:59:28.911 --> 00:59:32.990
And I'm like,
shut the fuck up already.
Um,
oh you,

1021
00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:36.170
but you don't have material for a whole show.
No,
I know.
I'm just done this.

1022
00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:38.120
He's opening for me next week.

1023
00:59:40.220 --> 00:59:43.550
But this was the progressive utopia,
this place.
Oh,
so then,

1024
00:59:43.551 --> 00:59:45.050
so then I take a picture,
get this,

1025
00:59:45.051 --> 00:59:48.740
I take a picture of the broken glass in the window of the car and I get

1026
00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:50.510
literally hundreds of people telling me,

1027
00:59:50.511 --> 00:59:53.990
don't you know there is an epidemic in this city about people just punching and

1028
00:59:53.991 --> 00:59:57.890
windows and stealing shit.
And then on top of that,
people started telling me,

1029
00:59:57.891 --> 00:59:59.390
this is absolutely true.

1030
00:59:59.630 --> 01:00:04.630
There is an APP for people in San Francisco to download so that you can find out

1031
01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:09.740
where human feces is on the street so that you can avoid those streets when

1032
01:00:09.741 --> 01:00:11.870
you're walking.
The dog wants,

1033
01:00:11.871 --> 01:00:15.170
they just don't forget the dog go the dog poop that.
Yeah,
we're good.

1034
01:00:15.770 --> 01:00:19.940
But literally for human poop and you have to download an APP to do that.

1035
01:00:19.941 --> 01:00:22.760
This isn't the progressive utopia.
We're now drugs have run rampant.

1036
01:00:22.761 --> 01:00:26.350
I mean Berkeley Berkeley looks like a circus,
but it really does look like,

1037
01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:30.070
like a carny show out there.
Always has been.
But looked at

1038
01:00:32.430 --> 01:00:33.550
Barclay was the whole home.

1039
01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:35.810
<v 2>Berkeley one at one time was the home of freedom.</v>

1040
01:00:35.811 --> 01:00:37.870
I mean it was the home of free speech Oh,
bit bit.

1041
01:00:37.871 --> 01:00:40.430
But the people who advocate for free speech and Berkeley didn't,

1042
01:00:40.460 --> 01:00:41.840
weren't advocating for freedom.

1043
01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:45.950
They were advocating for a particular type of oppression because they were,

1044
01:00:45.951 --> 01:00:47.480
they were,
they were the leftist stuff today.

1045
01:00:47.481 --> 01:00:51.530
They were the professors who turned the group of students who today are the nuts

1046
01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:53.600
into what they are.
So I,
I don't,

1047
01:00:53.630 --> 01:00:57.860
I don't have a romantic vision of the free speech movement of the 1960s I mean,

1048
01:00:57.861 --> 01:00:58.190
I ran,

1049
01:00:58.190 --> 01:01:02.150
wrote extensively about that what was going on on campuses in the 60s and it was

1050
01:01:02.151 --> 01:01:04.460
bad.
It was not true freedom.

1051
01:01:04.461 --> 01:01:07.850
They didn't understand what the concept of freedom really was.
It was again,

1052
01:01:07.851 --> 01:01:11.540
a rejection of reason and rejection of individualism,
rejection of capitalism,

1053
01:01:11.810 --> 01:01:14.630
all the DNA of doing whatever we feel like doing right.

1054
01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:18.050
Feel like doing it and therefore we should be able to feel like saying whatever

1055
01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:21.320
it wasn't,
there wasn't a proper defense of free speech and that's why he lost.

1056
01:01:21.650 --> 01:01:24.560
But look,
it's not,

1057
01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:29.420
this is the thing nobody learns from experience is a statement for you.

1058
01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:31.490
Nobody learns from experience.
Right.

1059
01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:34.130
If people actually learn from what works and what doesn't work,

1060
01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:38.150
then we would be living in laissez faire.
Capitalist's heaven.
But they don't,

1061
01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:41.090
right?
I mean vocalese nothing is competitive in its well.

1062
01:01:42.140 --> 01:01:46.850
Venezuela people are starving to death.
Little babies don't get food.

1063
01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:51.710
They starved.
Our people have eaten all their pets,
they broken into the zoo's,

1064
01:01:51.740 --> 01:01:56.120
they've eaten all the animals in the zoos,
and they just isn't any more food.

1065
01:01:56.210 --> 01:02:01.090
And people are literally dying,
right?
Uh,
millions of people have not exited,

1066
01:02:01.091 --> 01:02:03.260
vented to all and going into Columbia,
right?

1067
01:02:03.261 --> 01:02:07.190
Not exactly a place you want to escape to,
you know,
to find prosperity.

1068
01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:10.070
But it's so much richer.
The Venezuela,
right?

1069
01:02:11.180 --> 01:02:16.040
And yet this is socialism.
This is always the consequence of socialism.

1070
01:02:16.490 --> 01:02:20.520
And yet you've got all these young people want to be socialists and they said,

1071
01:02:20.521 --> 01:02:25.080
no,
that isn't the real socialism.
Okay.
So what it shows,
it's never been tried.

1072
01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:29.370
The one that they only say every person who's ever said they were trying

1073
01:02:29.371 --> 01:02:34.230
socialist created a hell hole.
Right?
So,
so take,

1074
01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:37.770
take on the one hand you say that about San Francisco but also what you noticed

1075
01:02:37.771 --> 01:02:42.240
in San Francisco.
It's the high rises going up.
I mean it's on it.
I,
you know,

1076
01:02:42.270 --> 01:02:44.660
I lived in San Jose,
close to San Francisco,
uh,

1077
01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:47.040
20 years ago and it's non identifiable to cities.

1078
01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:51.960
Completely changed the whole Saul south of market phenomenon,
skyscrapers,

1079
01:02:51.961 --> 01:02:54.540
the construction even here in Chicago,
construction everywhere.

1080
01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:59.580
So on the one hand you've got this booming and on the other hand you've got

1081
01:02:59.581 --> 01:03:03.600
massive quantities of homeless people because homeless people know that nothing

1082
01:03:03.601 --> 01:03:04.320
will happen to them.

1083
01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:08.650
They can poop anywhere in San Francisco and there's an APP so nobody cares.
Um,

1084
01:03:08.930 --> 01:03:09.930
you know,
in La,

1085
01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:12.690
La is another example where they're homeless people every way and why,

1086
01:03:12.691 --> 01:03:15.850
and people always wondered why they homeless people.
And,

1087
01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:20.370
and because the city of La has guaranteed that they will build housing for all

1088
01:03:20.371 --> 01:03:21.630
the homeless people stay,

1089
01:03:21.631 --> 01:03:24.240
keep building housing and putting the homeless people in.

1090
01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:28.020
And yet they always are more homeless people and they don't understand where do

1091
01:03:28.021 --> 01:03:32.400
these homeless people come from?
Well,
I don't know about you guys,

1092
01:03:32.401 --> 01:03:34.980
but when somebody is offering free stuff like free housing,

1093
01:03:35.550 --> 01:03:38.400
I'm not going to stay homeless in Chicago where it's cold,

1094
01:03:38.850 --> 01:03:41.550
I'm going to go somewhere where it's warm and they promise free housing.

1095
01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:45.600
So the more they build homes for homeless people,
the Wallace people,

1096
01:03:45.601 --> 01:03:48.990
there will be,
that's basic incentives.

1097
01:03:49.110 --> 01:03:52.590
This is not hard sophisticated economics.

1098
01:03:52.650 --> 01:03:56.730
This is how the world works,
right?
So you know,

1099
01:03:56.950 --> 01:04:01.290
California is this country,
the state of complete,
you know,

1100
01:04:01.291 --> 01:04:04.110
dramatic extremes.
You know,

1101
01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:06.390
I live lived in Orange County,

1102
01:04:06.570 --> 01:04:10.710
which is like the most pleasant place to live on the planet.
It's so beautiful.

1103
01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:15.570
Big streets,
everybody's basically rich and life is wonderful.

1104
01:04:15.630 --> 01:04:20.070
But you go out to the central valley or you go to skid row in la or you see

1105
01:04:20.071 --> 01:04:24.300
people as poorly as anywhere in the United States and it's,

1106
01:04:24.330 --> 01:04:26.340
that's what you have in,
in,
in California.

1107
01:04:26.341 --> 01:04:30.690
And fewer and fewer people in the middle.
You have wealth and you have poverty.

1108
01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:31.680
And,

1109
01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:35.040
and people in the middle of somehow getting by because they real estate keeps

1110
01:04:35.041 --> 01:04:38.460
getting more expensive and nobody can afford to live in San Francisco anymore.

1111
01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:42.510
Um,
and you know what?
People blame the fact that there was just a,

1112
01:04:42.511 --> 01:04:44.820
an amazing story in the Mercury News,

1113
01:04:44.821 --> 01:04:47.100
which is the local newspaper in the bay area.

1114
01:04:47.730 --> 01:04:50.490
Who Do they blame for the high cost of living in San Francisco?

1115
01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:52.940
Who's to blame Trump?

1116
01:04:57.150 --> 01:05:01.470
Who's to blame technology companies because they creating too many jobs.

1117
01:05:02.250 --> 01:05:05.310
They're creating too many jobs,
right?
So their pricing out so,
so,
so,

1118
01:05:05.311 --> 01:05:08.550
so too many people are coming.
So it's,
it's their fault.
Right?

1119
01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.780
And of course the last piece fill that lame is local government.

1120
01:05:12.930 --> 01:05:15.480
Now turns out that there's an economist and you go there,

1121
01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:20.710
the only people to blame a local gum because how building they're not giving

1122
01:05:20.711 --> 01:05:23.470
permits then our building high then you know,

1123
01:05:23.471 --> 01:05:25.250
so they say there's not enough room to grow.

1124
01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:28.570
They build high instead of just office buildings built condos.

1125
01:05:28.571 --> 01:05:31.540
They don't build condos in San Francisco.
But why,

1126
01:05:32.170 --> 01:05:33.790
why don't they build condos in San Francisco?

1127
01:05:35.620 --> 01:05:38.530
Because the people who live in the nice houses don't get our own notes,

1128
01:05:38.590 --> 01:05:42.850
not in my backyard,
on in my backyard.
So nobody said don't build high rises even,

1129
01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:46.800
you know,
expensive,
high rise.
They just don't want,
the view's blocked.

1130
01:05:46.801 --> 01:05:49.450
They don't want whatever.
Right?
So,
no,

1131
01:05:49.451 --> 01:05:51.970
but the fault is we creating too many jobs.

1132
01:05:52.030 --> 01:05:55.060
It's those greedy capitalists creating too many jobs and creating too much

1133
01:05:55.061 --> 01:05:59.830
wealth and creating the iPhone,
whatever.
You know,
that's the problem.
It's,

1134
01:05:59.860 --> 01:06:03.220
it's mind boggling.
And this,
this is not hard stuff.
So yeah,

1135
01:06:03.221 --> 01:06:05.800
you should be able to look at San Francisco and say,
we don't want that.

1136
01:06:05.830 --> 01:06:08.110
You should be able to look at vintage and let's say we don't want that.

1137
01:06:08.140 --> 01:06:12.990
You should go be able to go to Hong Kong and say,
Whoa,
what did they do?
Right?
Or,

1138
01:06:13.010 --> 01:06:13.450
or,
or,

1139
01:06:13.450 --> 01:06:16.300
or go to the United States and look at the 19th century and look at where we

1140
01:06:16.301 --> 01:06:20.890
started and where we ended up and go,
Whoa,
I want to be like that.
So this is,

1141
01:06:20.891 --> 01:06:22.690
goes back to the moral point I made earlier.

1142
01:06:22.990 --> 01:06:25.990
Let's go study what works and what doesn't.
That's true in economics,

1143
01:06:25.991 --> 01:06:28.690
that student politics,
it's true in life.
I'm a scientist.

1144
01:06:28.691 --> 01:06:29.560
I want to be a scientist.

1145
01:06:29.561 --> 01:06:32.770
I want to go on in nature and figure out what works and what doesn't work.

1146
01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:35.140
And I want to do what works and I want to avoid what doesn't work.

1147
01:06:35.470 --> 01:06:38.650
Not Work in the moment,
but work over over a lifetime.
Right.

1148
01:06:38.830 --> 01:06:43.630
And what works is capitalism.
What works with free markets was,
works,
is,
you know,

1149
01:06:43.631 --> 01:06:46.630
a certain approach to your own individual life and what doesn't work as

1150
01:06:46.631 --> 01:06:50.230
socialism and,
and,
and uh,
focusing on,
uh,
you know,

1151
01:06:50.231 --> 01:06:52.960
guilt in taking care of others and,
and,
and all of that.

1152
01:06:52.990 --> 01:06:55.390
If you live a good life for yourself.

1153
01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:59.860
And if everybody had that attitude or most people had that attitude,
wow.

1154
01:07:00.130 --> 01:07:02.890
You know,
whenever it be tried,
it works amazing.

1155
01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:07.910
Or we have to do is do it right.
It's just,
just do it.
That's the Nike thing.
Yeah.

1156
01:07:08.190 --> 01:07:09.200
<v 1>Do,
there you go.</v>

1157
01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:13.350
[inaudible] right now and really if you want,

1158
01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:16.640
know how bananas things have gotten in,
in San Francisco and Silicon Valley.

1159
01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:18.220
Peter Thiel is leaving.

1160
01:07:18.290 --> 01:07:22.250
He's taking his companies and leaving and he's moving to the freedom,

1161
01:07:22.251 --> 01:07:24.620
loving Los Angeles.
Unbelievable.
Think about that.

1162
01:07:24.621 --> 01:07:28.340
Really it's going wacky left a slightly less WAC yet,

1163
01:07:28.341 --> 01:07:31.640
but in his estimation that that is how crazy that thing has gotten.

1164
01:07:31.730 --> 01:07:33.280
I want to mention one other thing and then we'll get to the,

1165
01:07:33.290 --> 01:07:37.340
<v 2>he was,
I moved just a,
we were clear.
I moved to Puerto Rico.
Yeah.
Yes.</v>

1166
01:07:37.341 --> 01:07:40.790
I live in Puerto Rico now.
He doesn't just talk about,
not yet.
He's living it.

1167
01:07:40.940 --> 01:07:45.830
I'm living it because taxes and Puerto Rico are somewhere around 4% all in

1168
01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:49.130
federal,
state,
everything.
Yeah.

1169
01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:50.560
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1170
01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:55.560
[inaudible] a political party in Puerto Rico,

1171
01:07:57.351 --> 01:08:00.890
so if you guys move,
yeah.
You know we're going to take the place over.
All right.

1172
01:08:00.891 --> 01:08:04.140
Maybe.
Maybe I'll be the mayor of San Juan or something.
You don't vinyl final.

1173
01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:07.940
You mentioned Orange County and if you want to talk about a really oppressive

1174
01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:11.570
state government.
I the first time I went to Orange County,

1175
01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:16.720
I went to a journey concert and I got for smoking weed at a journey concert,

1176
01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:23.590
which I thought you had to [inaudible].
So that is what is wrong with government.

1177
01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:25.220
All right,
well this has been an absolute pleasure.

1178
01:08:25.221 --> 01:08:29.240
Let me talk to the camera for a second because I do believe in capitalism and

1179
01:08:29.241 --> 01:08:33.080
all of the good freedom loving stuff that you're on and I have talked about here

1180
01:08:33.230 --> 01:08:36.320
and most likely this video has been demonetized by youtube already.

1181
01:08:37.550 --> 01:08:41.060
We are on Patrion.
So this live stream right now is,

1182
01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:42.710
we're going to air the Q and a on that,

1183
01:08:42.711 --> 01:08:45.530
but if you're watching this on tape delay as it were,

1184
01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:46.700
what year did I come up with?

1185
01:08:46.701 --> 01:08:50.720
That phrase from the Q and a that we're about to do is going to be a patriot

1186
01:08:50.730 --> 01:08:53.480
exclusive,
although it'll all be aired live right now.
