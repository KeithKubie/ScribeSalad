00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:02.934
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Oh, so Andy, it sounds like our senseletes are getting ready for the final

00:00:02.934 --> 00:00:06.665
events. Let's go back to Susan and see what's going on. Back to you, Susan.

00:00:06.665 --> 00:00:11.197
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hi, you guys. It's really exciting over here. As you can see, we're getting set

00:00:11.197 --> 00:00:14.308
up with the eye charts, and the athletes are warming up for the first sight

00:00:14.308 --> 00:00:15.794
event.

00:00:15.794 --> 00:00:18.982
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And how does this event work?

00:00:18.982 --> 00:00:21.958
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, actually you can see the charts have letters with different sizes on

00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:23.095
them.

00:00:23.095 --> 00:00:27.060
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The contestants have to read the letters, and those that can read the smallest

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.605
letters get more points awarded. They have to read those without glasses.

00:00:31.605 --> 00:00:34.605
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Any comments from what you've seen so far in this event?

00:00:34.605 --> 00:00:38.325
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It's actually pretty interesting how dramatically different some of our

00:00:38.325 --> 00:00:42.442
contestants are. For example, some cannot even read the largest letters, where

00:00:42.442 --> 00:00:45.075
some can read almost all of the smallest ones.

00:00:45.075 --> 00:00:48.480
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, it looks like some of our contestants are nearsighted huh, Susan?

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.231
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You're definitely right Andy. It's a good thing these contestants can wear

00:00:52.231 --> 00:00:55.344
their glasses when they're not at these events.

00:00:55.344 --> 00:00:57.089
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Lucky indeed. Thanks a lot Susan.
