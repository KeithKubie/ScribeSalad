00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.980
[grand, majestic instrumentals]

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.160
Let's finish up Disneycember with...

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.020
Tinkerbell!

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.100
Yeah...there was a strange while

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.000
where Tinker Bell was EXTREMELY popular.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.860
It's weird, because the character's been around for years and years,

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.740
but only now did the popularity just...explode.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.160
Was this movie the cause of it?

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:29.080
Maybe.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.260
It opens literally with Tinker Bell's birth,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.520
which is kind of like what they say in the book,

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.680
where a child laughs, that laugh goes to Neverland,

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.320
and then, suddenly, a fairy is born.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.340
Only...she's not born like a little baby.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.840
She's born fully grown.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.320
I guess it's like Pinocchio,

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.640
where the personality is just...

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:44.240
in tact.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.620
Oh, why am I analyzing it? It's FAIRY TALES,

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.380
and this is obviously made for little kids

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.480
who just want to see Tinkerbell fly around,

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.840
look pretty, do some magic, and...

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:54.720
yeah, that's about it.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.260
The story is...pretty standard,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.560
but you can tell it's written for little children.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.460
Tinker Bell is looking for her place to belong,

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.300
and she's put with...the Tinker Fairies.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.100
Yeah. Who would've thought?

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.300
Tinker Bell is really good at...tinkering.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.920
Putting things together, figuring out gears and such.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.960
Unfortunately, though,

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.760
her inventions don't always work out that well,

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.900
and that means that she can't join the group of fairies

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.220
that leave Neverland and go into the other world,

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.240
so Tinker Bell gets a group of fairies together,

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.600
and tries to have them teach her

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.940
how to do various other things that can get her into the other world.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.220
Unfortunately, she doesn't seem very good at it.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.420
She's only good at tinkering and making stuff,

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.180
annnnnd, even then, she's not that great, either.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.900
Through hard work and determination,

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:30.420
she will...

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.640
make everything really bad. Yeah...

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.140
it's one of those stories where she screws up everything for everyone,

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.020
but...she also finds a way to make it better in the end,

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.960
and a nice little compromise is made.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.320
Actually, that is one of the things I really admire about this movie:

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.980
the message of compromise.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.380
That is to say, Tinker Bell eventually comes to terms with her gifts,

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.560
but she also pushes really hard to get what she wants

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.360
and what she feels is rightfully hers.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.040
I admire films like "Wreck-It Ralph" or "Nightmare Before Christmas"

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.260
that sort of say "Just be happy with what you have,"

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.840
but I also like stories like this,

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.620
where it's 'be happy with what you have, but don't be afraid to go a little further, too.'

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.020
Fight for what you really want.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.580
Sometimes, you get it. Sometimes, you don't,

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.540
and sometimes, it's halfway in between, like what we have here.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.840
But...is there anything really that gripping for adults in this?

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.580
Not especially - this is something that's written for little, little kids,

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.460
but, for little, little kids, it's... innocent enough.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.840
It definitely has a visual style. Some of the backgrounds are very nice.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.880
The everyday items they use from flowers and raindrops and such are pretty clever,

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.340
and the movie IS trying to have a certain weight to it.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.040
The music especially is trying to give this grand choir going

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.220
[imitating a falsetto singing voice ] "Ah, ah, ah, ah"

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.240
and make it seem really huge, and - you know what?

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.200
It's allowed.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.820
I mean, look at this animation style.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.080
This is clearly trying a lot harder than something like "Twice Upon a Christmas".

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.900
They WANT it to look whimsical. They want it to feel like these characters are alive,

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.840
and for the most part, they do a good job.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.100
Outside of that, there's not really THAT much to get into for adults,

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.840
although I do love this one scene when she's testing her equipment.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.260
[chuckling] Why does that crack me up so much?

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.860
But aside from that, it's not incredibly smart,

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.620
but it's not incredibly dumb, either.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.900
It's a nice little innocent film to show your kids, and they'll get some creativity.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.080
There are slow moments. There's times where they need the emotion to set in,

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.020
but there's also fast moments, and there's scenes where they throw in the little pop song and such.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.180
I'm DEFINITELY not gonna put it on any time soon,

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.380
but if I had little kids, and they wanted to watch this,

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.820
I'd say it's a good thing to put on.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.500
I don't have NEARLY enough time to look at the dozens of sequels that came out afterwards.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.760
I know, it's ironic, seeing how this was sequel month, but...

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.240
like the movie said, "Compromise. It's a good thing."

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.280
And, with that said, that wraps up Disneycember with the direct-to-DVD sequels.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.020
Was it as bad as I thought it was gonna be? Well...

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.920
In some areas, it was even worse,

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.740
but, in some areas, it was actually okay,  and

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.500
surprisingly in others, I found myself having a good time.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.280
You can definitely tell which films were just rushed out and they didn't really care about,

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.360
and which ones they wanted to put the extra time and effort into,

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.120
even when they didn't NEED to put in the extra time and effort.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.120
I'm not gonna act like any of these were great,

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.380
but I was shocked to find those couple that were actually - well, not only tolerable,

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.300
but...some legitimately entertaining.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.280
They were few, but I respected them.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.240
And the ones that were bad - like REALLY bad...

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.040
Well...they'll bring us a lot of laughs and mockery in just how awful they are.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.060
At least I can say I saw them all, and I gave them a fair shot, and...

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.340
though I was shocked with how bad some of them were,

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.380
I was shocked by how GOOD some of them were.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.960
I guess sometimes, even when a company like Disney just wants to throw their table scraps at us,

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.220
you...can actually take those table scraps and turn it into a good meal.

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.700
It doesn't happen all the time, but enough times to get noticed.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.500
Folks, I hope you enjoyed this year's Disneycember,

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.000
and if you're like me, you're anticipating what Disney has next to offer.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.280
Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next year.
