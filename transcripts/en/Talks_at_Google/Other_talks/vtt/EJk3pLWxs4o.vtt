[APPLAUSE]

00:00:23.437 --> 00:00:24.353
FEMALE SPEAKER: Check.

00:00:24.353 --> 00:00:28.340
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.190
All right, everyone.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.290
We're thrilled to
have our special guest

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.610
with us at the Google
LA office today.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.930
He is the biggest selling comedy
recording artist in history,

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.980
with over 12
million albums sold.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.100
Now in his fourth career
decade, he has won three Grammys

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.890
and as of Tuesday
released his 14th studio

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.362
album, "Mandatory Fun."

00:00:48.362 --> 00:00:50.820
Please join me in welcoming to
Google, "Weird Al" Yankovic.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:51.190
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC:
[? Yeah. ?] Thank you.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:51.689
Thank you.

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:52.742
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:56.918 --> 00:00:59.740
FEMALE SPEAKER: So Al,
you've had a busy week.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.830
You're releasing eight videos in
eight days, the first of which

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.349
was "Tacky."

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:09.060
And with all those cameos and
shot in one continuous shot

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.560
and having Jack Black twerk,
that had to have been chaotic.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.894
So can you walk us through
how everything came together?

00:01:14.894 --> 00:01:16.268
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC:
Well, I knew

00:01:16.268 --> 00:01:18.790
that I wanted to do one of
those one-take continuous-take

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.339
videos, like Pharrell had done
for his "24 Hours of Happy."

00:01:21.339 --> 00:01:22.880
And I thought it
would be kind of fun

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.304
to include some of my own
celebrity friends in it.

00:01:25.304 --> 00:01:27.470
And Jack Black was the first
person I thought about.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:28.767
I thought, he would kill it.

00:01:28.767 --> 00:01:29.892
FEMALE SPEAKER: Absolutely.

00:01:29.892 --> 00:01:31.850
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: His
energy is just insane.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.610
So I contacted him.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.270
And he was shooting a movie
in Atlanta, but he said,

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.580
I can come in for one day.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:39.945
I can do June 14.

00:01:39.945 --> 00:01:42.510
So I was like, OK, that's the
day we're doing the video.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.407
And everybody else if they
weren't available on June 14

00:01:45.407 --> 00:01:46.240
they couldn't do it.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.950
So I went through and I also
got Aisha Tyler, Margaret Cho,

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.200
Eric Stonestreet from "Modern
Family," Kristen Schaal.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.510
I got them all together at the
Palace Theater in downtown LA.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.310
And I just kind of
figured it out so

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.430
that we could use
the whole building.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.590
It's a beautiful old
building with an old elevator

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.500
and beautiful windows.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.139
Logistically, it
was tough because I

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:11.580
start the video on the
fifth floor fire escape,

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.730
and I end the video
on street level

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.080
in completely different clothes.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.860
FEMALE SPEAKER: It's impressive.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.443
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC:
There's no edits.

00:02:17.443 --> 00:02:18.780
It's all in one continuous take.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.900
So basically every
shot, every take,

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.670
as soon as the
camera was off me,

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.460
I had to run as fast as I can
down five flights of stairs

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.570
while changing my clothes.

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:28.890
FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh my gosh.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:29.330
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC:
Just so I can hit my mark

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.050
and be ready for the
end of the video.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.480
FEMALE SPEAKER: Wow.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.270
So you got your workout in.

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.720
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: I did.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.980
Absolutely.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.313
FEMALE SPEAKER: Needless to say.

00:02:34.313 --> 00:02:36.440
Why eight videos in eight days?

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.560
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: I
wanted it to be like Hanukkah

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.393
in July. [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:38.393 --> 00:02:39.134
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:43.400
I just thought that
that was the best

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.800
way to advertise the album
because I wanted release week

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.070
to be an event.

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.530
I wanted people talking
about the video everyday

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:51.724
for the entire week.

00:02:51.724 --> 00:02:53.390
And things burn quickly
on the internet.

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.450
People consume, they
gobble up things.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.170
And then tomorrow, like
oh that's old news.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.697
My friend saw that yesterday.

00:02:59.697 --> 00:03:00.780
Everything's so immediate.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.940
I wanted things to
go viral for a day

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.087
and have each video
have its moment.

00:03:06.087 --> 00:03:08.170
FEMALE SPEAKER: And the
latest one, "Sports Song,"

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.000
came out today.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.480
So everyone needs to make sure
to check that out as well.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.010
The second video, "Word
Crimes," was a take

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.550
on Robin Thicke's now
infamous "Blurred Lines."

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:21.290
And between the video along
with the famous Miley Cyrus VMA

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.550
performance, it garnered
a lot of media attention.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.180
When writing the
song did you consider

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.160
drawing from all
that controversy?

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.130
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC:
Well, I specifically

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.880
did not want to draw
from that controversy

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.140
because "Blurred Lines"
was almost a year

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.840
old by the time
this album came out.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.210
And I was aware that
there were already

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.130
10,000 parodies of
the song on YouTube.

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.690
And a lot of them had to
do with how misogynistic

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.605
and/or rapey the
original song was.

00:03:48.605 --> 00:03:50.605
So I didn't want to tread
that ground because it

00:03:50.605 --> 00:03:52.521
had been covered over
and over and over again.

00:03:52.521 --> 00:03:56.030
And that's one of the
things with YouTube.

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.200
I'm not going to be the
only person doing parodies.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.212
So I have to not take
the most obvious tact.

00:04:00.212 --> 00:04:02.170
I have to do something
a little left of center.

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.740
And I figured,
well, I bet nobody's

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:07.180
done a parody of that song based
on the proper usage of grammar.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.346
FEMALE SPEAKER:
It's very true, yes.

00:04:09.346 --> 00:04:10.720
Well, that brings
up a good point

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.136
because with the
advent of YouTube

00:04:12.136 --> 00:04:14.660
you mentioned that it's forced
you to become more creative.

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.870
Are there other ways that
the evolution of the web

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.110
has caused you to really
challenge yourself

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:21.124
in your career?

00:04:21.124 --> 00:04:22.540
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC:
Well, the web

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.190
has just become the way
that I market my music now.

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.429
I mean, I don't market
through MTV anymore.

00:04:27.429 --> 00:04:28.470
That's not even a factor.

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.553
I don't think of them, and
they don't think of me.

00:04:30.553 --> 00:04:31.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.490
Well, MTV used to stand
for Music Television.

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:35.850
And now it's not so much.

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.000
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
very different programming

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.500
these days.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.070
Yeah.

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.560
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: So for
all intents and purposes

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.270
the internet for me at least
has become the new MTV.

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.740
So everything that I do
is geared toward that.

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.310
And now for this album I
was able to do my videos

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.670
with internet partners,
like Nerdist, and College

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:54.860
Humor, and Funny
or Die, and places

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.490
that were looking for
content the same way

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.711
that I was looking for
a free music video.

00:04:59.711 --> 00:05:00.210
So we--

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.706
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:00.706 --> 00:05:01.700
FEMALE SPEAKER: It's
a win-win situation.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:02.282
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: We
kind of partnered up.

00:05:02.282 --> 00:05:02.734
FEMALE SPEAKER: Everyone
comes out on top.

00:05:02.734 --> 00:05:03.817
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: Yeah.

00:05:03.817 --> 00:05:04.320
Right.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.028
FEMALE SPEAKER: Was
there a song that you

00:05:06.028 --> 00:05:09.590
wanted to use on the album but
felt that it was too overdone

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.950
on YouTube or in other
people's parodies?

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.890
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC:
Well, "Blurred Lines"

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:14.848
was certainly overdone.

00:05:14.848 --> 00:05:19.400
And there are a few videos that
I was not treading new ground,

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.309
but I figured that if
I didn't do those songs

00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:23.600
it would be a glaring omission.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.100
People would be
like, why didn't you

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.290
do a "Blurred Lines" parody?

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.167
So I just try to do what I do.

00:05:28.167 --> 00:05:30.000
And even though I know
a lot of other people

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.710
are doing it as well, I try
to give it my best shot,

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.016
and hopefully I'll rise above.

00:05:35.016 --> 00:05:37.140
FEMALE SPEAKER: And it's
always such a unique take.

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.100
I mean, it's a completely
different topic

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.190
from the original song.

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.900
So how does that
process work for you?

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.720
What is the process
of picking a song

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.460
and then writing the lyrics?

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.418
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC:
Well, I pick songs usually

00:05:48.418 --> 00:05:50.720
based on how big
of a hit they are.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.900
Hopefully, my parodies are
funny even if you're not

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.691
familiar with the
original source material,

00:05:54.691 --> 00:05:57.580
but it's all obviously
funnier if you are.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.150
So I'll pick songs that are
number one on the Billboard

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.616
chart, getting a lot of online
attention and radio play.

00:06:03.616 --> 00:06:05.990
And I'll make a list, a target
list of songs that I think

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.055
are good candidates,
good targets for parody.

00:06:08.055 --> 00:06:09.430
And then for each
of those songs,

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:13.140
I will come up with as many
ideas as I possibly can.

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:15.862
Just generate puns
and variations

00:06:15.862 --> 00:06:17.320
on a theme and
different directions

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.160
I can go with the parody.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.050
And most of those
are really bad ideas.

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:23.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:25.250
I mean, it's really horrible--

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:26.260
FEMALE SPEAKER: You have to
get them all out and then--

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.593
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: Yeah,
but it's part of the process.

00:06:28.593 --> 00:06:31.040
You got to just let your
brain seep out onto the laptop

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.730
and just list everything
you can think of.

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:36.380
And afterwards I'll go
down the list and go, no.

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:36.880
Stupid.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:37.431
No.

00:06:37.431 --> 00:06:37.930
Bad.

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:38.170
No.

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:38.590
No.

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:40.590
And hopefully there's one
idea there [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:43.810
I go, yeah, I can do
something with that.

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:46.120
FEMALE SPEAKER: Maybe
something's there.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.120
A lot of people always
ask you about your choice

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.220
to get the artist's
permission before you actually

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:51.190
do the song.

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:54.030
And I know when dealing
with a team of people

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:56.350
it's a little more difficult
than actually dealing

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:57.960
with the artist himself usually.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:59.470
Is there something
really memorable

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:01.721
from a time that you tried
to get somebody's blessing?

00:07:01.721 --> 00:07:04.095
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: Well,
there's a number of occasions,

00:07:04.095 --> 00:07:05.900
and I've spoken of them a lot.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.170
But I mean, usually
it's my manager

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:09.300
talking to their manager.

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:10.799
And it's all done
behind the scenes.

00:07:10.799 --> 00:07:13.359
But on occasion my
manager will say,

00:07:13.359 --> 00:07:14.900
they're not returning
my phone calls.

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.110
And if you want to
get this approved

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:19.210
you'll have to do it yourself.

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:21.184
So then I have to seek
out the original artist

00:07:21.184 --> 00:07:23.600
and contact them and hope they
have a good sense of humor.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.474
And that's happened a
small handful of times.

00:07:25.474 --> 00:07:28.150
The most famous example
probably being Kurt Cobain.

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:30.150
I called him on the set
of "Saturday Night Live"

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:32.025
back when he was doing
it for the first time.

00:07:32.025 --> 00:07:35.299
And I said, hi, it's
"Weird Al" Yankovic,

00:07:35.299 --> 00:07:37.840
and I would like to do a parody
of "Smells Like Teen Spirit."

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.010
And his immediate
response was, oh,

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:41.510
is it going to be
a song about food?

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:42.983
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:42.983 --> 00:07:45.441
FEMALE SPEAKER: Because a lot
of your songs are about food.

00:07:45.441 --> 00:07:45.602
Yeah.

00:07:45.602 --> 00:07:45.874
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: Yeah.

00:07:45.874 --> 00:07:46.707
Right, right, right.

00:07:46.707 --> 00:07:48.240
And I had to explain,
well, no, it's

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.710
going to be a song
about how nobody

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:50.834
can understand your lyrics.

00:07:50.834 --> 00:07:52.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:53.850
FEMALE SPEAKER: And
what was his reaction?

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:56.058
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: He
said, yeah, OK, that's funny.

00:07:56.058 --> 00:07:57.869
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:57.869 --> 00:07:59.910
FEMALE SPEAKER: Now I
wanted to clarify something

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:02.110
because I heard a story
one time about you

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:04.210
and Prince at the
American Music Awards.

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:07.734
And it was that you received
a letter from Prince's lawyer

00:08:07.734 --> 00:08:10.150
saying you cannot make eye
contact with him at the Awards.

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:10.630
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: Yes.

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:11.080
FEMALE SPEAKER: Is that true?

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:11.940
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC:
That sounds like a joke,

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:12.860
but that's absolutely true.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:13.984
FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh my gosh.

00:08:13.984 --> 00:08:16.580
So did you oblige them?

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:17.371
Or did you try to--

00:08:17.371 --> 00:08:18.610
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: Well,
first thing I'll tell you,

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:21.030
I immediately sent back a
telegram to them saying,

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:22.761
yes, Prince can't
look at me either.

00:08:22.761 --> 00:08:23.261
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:23.261 --> 00:08:24.011
It goes both ways.

00:08:24.011 --> 00:08:25.261
FEMALE SPEAKER: That was good.

00:08:25.261 --> 00:08:25.851
That was good.

00:08:25.851 --> 00:08:26.350
Yeah.

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:27.620
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC:
And I'll tell you

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:29.820
I actually did sneak a few
peeks at him during the show.

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:30.075
FEMALE SPEAKER: Good.

00:08:30.075 --> 00:08:31.720
Did you actually make
eye contact or no?

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:32.090
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: No!

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:32.881
FEMALE SPEAKER: No.

00:08:32.881 --> 00:08:33.600
Heaven forbid.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.260
You don't want the
wrath of Prince.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:36.777
That's for sure.

00:08:36.777 --> 00:08:38.610
This is a big month
because not only did you

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:40.110
release your album,
but we're also

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:43.020
coming up on the 25th
anniversary of the cult classic

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:45.430
that you wrote and
starred in "UHF."

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:47.301
And there were a lot of--

00:08:47.301 --> 00:08:48.223
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:48.223 --> 00:08:49.145
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC:
Oh, please, sit down.

00:08:49.145 --> 00:08:49.644
Sit down.

00:08:49.644 --> 00:08:50.280
Please.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.690
Please.

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:53.690
FEMALE SPEAKER: There
were a lot of expectations

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:56.990
around the success of
the film at the time.

00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:58.410
Is there anything
that you learned

00:08:58.410 --> 00:08:59.900
from that experience
that has stuck

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:01.740
with you throughout your career?

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:03.240
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC:
Yeah, I learned

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.822
don't make a big flop movie.

00:09:05.822 --> 00:09:08.030
It didn't do well at the
box office when it came out,

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:11.030
and the critics didn't really
champion it at the time,

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:13.215
but it's gone on to become
a nice little cult film.

00:09:13.215 --> 00:09:14.340
FEMALE SPEAKER: Absolutely.

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:15.881
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC:
I mean, the fans

00:09:15.881 --> 00:09:17.880
have become obsessive about it.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:22.680
I mean, it found its audience
on cable TV and VHS and DVD.

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:24.482
And when it came
out on DVD, it was

00:09:24.482 --> 00:09:27.775
a top 10 best-selling
title, which

00:09:27.775 --> 00:09:29.400
blew away everybody's
minds at the time

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:30.810
because like, well,
this was a flop movie.

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:31.893
Why is it selling so well?

00:09:31.893 --> 00:09:33.140
But it found its audience.

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:34.431
FEMALE SPEAKER: That's amazing.

00:09:34.431 --> 00:09:37.159
Would you ever revisit the
project in some capacity?

00:09:37.159 --> 00:09:39.700
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: People ask
if I'm going to do a "UHF 2."

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:41.575
And I don't think that's
really in the cards.

00:09:41.575 --> 00:09:44.231
But I could do another movie
with that kind of sensibility,

00:09:44.231 --> 00:09:46.480
but I just don't think I'd
want to do a direct sequel.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.271
FEMALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:09:47.271 --> 00:09:47.819
Interesting.

00:09:47.819 --> 00:09:48.360
Good to know.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:51.250
Something to look
forward to maybe.

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:54.020
You also wrote two
children's books,

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:56.400
which some people might be
surprised to hear about.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.819
What brought that project about?

00:09:58.819 --> 00:10:00.360
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC:
I was approached

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:03.350
by an editor from
HarperCollins, Anne Hoppe.

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:06.359
She was a big fan of my music
and the wordplay in my lyrics.

00:10:06.359 --> 00:10:08.150
And she approached me
after one of my shows

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:11.802
at the Beacon in New
York City and said,

00:10:11.802 --> 00:10:13.510
I work for HarperCollins,
and if you ever

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:14.530
want to write a
children's book, I

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:15.820
think you'd be
pretty good at it.

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:16.700
And she gave me her card.

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:17.960
And I said, thank you very much.

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:20.210
I'm kind of busy at the
moment, but I'll let you know.

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:22.695
And about a year and a half
later, I took out that card,

00:10:22.695 --> 00:10:24.070
and I emailed her
and I said, you

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:26.450
know what, I think I
want to give this a shot.

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:27.610
FEMALE SPEAKER: A year
and a half later, wow.

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:29.026
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC:
I pitched her

00:10:29.026 --> 00:10:31.940
a couple of ideas and the one
that she responded to was,

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:33.880
"When I Grow Up."

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.420
So we worked together on that.

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:37.005
And it worked out very well.

00:10:37.005 --> 00:10:39.170
It became a "New York
Times" Best Seller.

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:41.930
So now I can say, the "New York
Times" best-selling author,

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:42.430
Al Yankovic.

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:43.804
FEMALE SPEAKER:
I'm going to have

00:10:43.804 --> 00:10:46.100
to write that into the
introduction next time.

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:48.970
So speaking of growing up,
you played the accordion

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:51.330
growing up, which it
seems like you've always

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:55.300
been someone who has
stood out from the crowd.

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:57.710
Was your originality
always encouraged,

00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:59.350
or were you ever
pressured to fit

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:00.760
in when you were growing up?

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:02.680
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: Well,
when you play the accordion,

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:04.010
you don't fit in by definition.

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:04.782
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:04.782 --> 00:11:05.706
FEMALE SPEAKER: Exactly, right?

00:11:05.706 --> 00:11:06.170
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: Right.

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:08.500
I mean, I tried to join
my friend's rock band.

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:10.940
And they were like,
you play an accordion.

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:13.160
So yeah, I found
out pretty early on

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.789
that I had to follow
my own path in life.

00:11:15.789 --> 00:11:17.830
FEMALE SPEAKER: And was
it hard sticking to that?

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:21.357
Was there ever pressure
to go another way?

00:11:21.357 --> 00:11:23.190
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC:
Well, here's the thing.

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:26.075
If I did the
conventional thing, if I

00:11:26.075 --> 00:11:28.710
had taken guitar lessons
instead of accordion lessons,

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:31.110
I probably wouldn't have been
discovered by Dr. Demento

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:33.780
because when I sent him tapes
that I recorded in my bedroom

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:35.755
as a teenager, the thing
that really stood out

00:11:35.755 --> 00:11:38.357
to him was here's a kid
playing the accordion

00:11:38.357 --> 00:11:39.315
and thinking he's cool.

00:11:39.315 --> 00:11:40.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:43.315
And that was the reason why he
played my stuff on the radio

00:11:43.315 --> 00:11:45.130
because he thought that
was such a novelty.

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:46.440
If I was playing the
guitar, he wouldn't

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:47.969
have given it a second listen.

00:11:47.969 --> 00:11:49.760
And if I hadn't gotten
the initial exposure

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.695
from Dr. Demento,
chances are I would not

00:11:52.695 --> 00:11:54.570
have any kind of career
in the music business

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:56.120
because that was my whole start.

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:57.745
FEMALE SPEAKER: Did he
serve as a mentor to you?

00:11:57.745 --> 00:11:58.890
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC:
He was my de-mentor.

00:11:58.890 --> 00:11:59.375
Yes.

00:11:59.375 --> 00:11:59.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:01.151
FEMALE SPEAKER: Your de-mentor.

00:12:01.151 --> 00:12:04.730
Was there any piece of
knowledge that he gave you

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:07.167
that you've really adhered to?

00:12:07.167 --> 00:12:09.500
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: I don't
remember anything specific,

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:12.140
but he was certainly a
guiding force early on.

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:15.010
I cut my teeth on the
Dr. Demento show with all

00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:17.930
my early-- I mean, I had several
songs on the Dr. Demento show

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:21.630
before anything actually made
it onto vinyl at the time.

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:23.310
"My Bologna" was
the first big hit.

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:27.950
But prior to that I had a
lot of parodies and originals

00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:29.989
that were of
substandard quality.

00:12:29.989 --> 00:12:30.780
But I was learning.

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:31.820
It was a learning curve.

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:33.810
And Dr. Demento guided
me through all that.

00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:35.716
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Your guiding force.

00:12:35.716 --> 00:12:37.340
Of all the artists
that you've covered,

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:40.210
is there someone that you
were particularly close to

00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:41.669
and maintained a
relationship with?

00:12:41.669 --> 00:12:43.334
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC:
I've become friends

00:12:43.334 --> 00:12:45.850
with a lot of the artists
that I've done parodies of.

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:47.480
Chris Ballew from the The
Presidents of the United States

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:47.980
of America.

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:50.450
I did "Gump" to his "Lump."

00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:52.050
And we've been friends
over the years.

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:54.240
And I'm still friends
with the guys in Hanson.

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:56.220
I'm friends with Ben Folds.

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:59.952
So every now and then
an actual relationship

00:12:59.952 --> 00:13:01.410
will come out of
this parody thing.

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:03.076
FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh,
wow, that's perfect.

00:13:03.076 --> 00:13:05.350
And I read before
that Madonna actually

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:07.060
suggested "Like A Surgeon."

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:07.753
Is that true?

00:13:07.753 --> 00:13:09.500
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC:
That is true.

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:11.812
Madonna was talking
to a friend of hers

00:13:11.812 --> 00:13:14.020
when she was walking down
the street in New York City

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:15.670
and just offhandedly
said, I wonder

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:17.750
when "Weird Al" is going
to do "Like A Surgeon."

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:20.409
And her friend knew a
friend of my manager

00:13:20.409 --> 00:13:21.950
and it got back to
me, and I thought,

00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:22.930
well, good idea, Madonna.

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:23.510
I think I will.

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:23.998
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:23.998 --> 00:13:25.331
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thanks, Madonna.

00:13:25.331 --> 00:13:26.930
All right.

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:29.860
And I remember hearing that
after "White and Nerdy"

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:33.980
came out that Chamillionaire,
the rapper from his original

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:37.710
song "Ridin'," came up to you
at the Grammys and credited you

00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:40.080
for his success of that song.

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:43.520
So is there an artist on the
radio today that has actively

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:45.785
requested you to do a
parody of their song?

00:13:45.785 --> 00:13:48.160
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: Well, I
run into people all the time

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.744
at parties and awards shows
that they say, when are you

00:13:50.744 --> 00:13:51.910
going to do one of my songs?

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:54.420
And I think they're just trying
to make conversation and be

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:54.920
nice.

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:56.527
But I mean, a lot
of artists really

00:13:56.527 --> 00:13:58.110
look forward to the
"Weird Al" parody.

00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:00.072
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:14:00.072 --> 00:14:02.530
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: There's
a song on the new album called

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:05.150
"Mission Statement," which is
a pastiche of Crosby, Stills

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:07.200
and Nash using
corporate buzzwords

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:10.070
and jargon but in
their '60s vibe.

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:11.640
And I just finished
recording it.

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:15.580
And I was doing a
radio tour in New York.

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:17.636
And Graham Nash was
in the next room.

00:14:17.636 --> 00:14:19.010
And I thought,
oh, this is great.

00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:19.968
I'll play him the song.

00:14:19.968 --> 00:14:22.850
And I walk over to the next
room and before he can even

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:24.861
say hi, he says, so
when are you going

00:14:24.861 --> 00:14:26.320
to do a parody of
one of my songs?

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:30.356
So I got my phone and
said, oh, here you go.

00:14:30.356 --> 00:14:31.814
FEMALE SPEAKER: It
just so happens.

00:14:31.814 --> 00:14:33.355
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC:
Instant request.

00:14:33.355 --> 00:14:35.050
FEMALE SPEAKER: Very nice.

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:38.080
I wanted to ask too
is there anything

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:42.890
that really is a total
faux pas in your opinion

00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:43.700
on social media?

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:45.680
Because "Tacky" and
"Word Crime" both

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:48.110
allude to a lot of
things that just

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:51.120
can be so annoying in
Twitter and everyone's posts.

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:55.080
Is there anything that really
bugs you about social media?

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:57.430
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: I'm
making some of my own faux pas.

00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:59.080
I'm trying not to over tweet.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:02.050
I'm trying not to retweet people
that are complimenting me.

00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:03.290
That's a little tacky.

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:04.950
I do a little bit of that.

00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:06.600
And I want to promote the album.

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:09.020
But there's so many people
saying wonderful things

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:10.510
about the album, I just
want to retweet everybody.

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:11.820
But then it's like, oh, stop.

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:14.300
Just stop.

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:15.800
FEMALE SPEAKER: Now
reflecting back,

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.466
we were talking a
little bit about this.

00:15:17.466 --> 00:15:18.190
MTV.

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:20.570
You had your show
"Al TV" back then.

00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:23.140
What do you think of
the programming on MTV

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:25.672
and other shows with reality
television and everything?

00:15:25.672 --> 00:15:27.380
What is your take on
[? it ?] these days?

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:28.530
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: I have
not watched MTV in years.

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:30.363
I have no idea what
they're doing right now.

00:15:30.363 --> 00:15:33.296
Last I checked it was basically
a reality show channel.

00:15:33.296 --> 00:15:34.420
I'm not into reality shows.

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:34.930
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Not into reality.

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:37.434
Is there anything on TV
that you're on top of right

00:15:37.434 --> 00:15:38.850
now that you're
just in love with?

00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:40.550
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: There's
a lot of shows that I like.

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:41.966
I was a big fan
of "Breaking Bad."

00:15:41.966 --> 00:15:44.450
I love "Mad Men."
"Comedy Bang Bang"

00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:45.690
was one of my favorite shows.

00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:46.387
"Key &amp; Peele."

00:15:46.387 --> 00:15:48.470
I love "The Daily Show"
and "Saturday Night Live."

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:50.187
And there's some
event programming

00:15:50.187 --> 00:15:51.520
that I definitely have to watch.

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:53.440
But it's a fairly
small group of shows.

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:55.939
FEMALE SPEAKER: And it was funny
you mentioned "Key &amp; Peele"

00:15:55.939 --> 00:15:59.087
because Reddit did
an AMA with you.

00:15:59.087 --> 00:16:01.420
And somebody brought up that
Key and Peele were actually

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:02.450
in the "White &amp; Nerdy" video.

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:02.735
Is that right?

00:16:02.735 --> 00:16:02.963
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: Right.

00:16:02.963 --> 00:16:05.870
Yeah, they're the gangsters
at the beginning of the video.

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:07.651
They're cruising
along, and they see me.

00:16:07.651 --> 00:16:09.400
And I'm mowing my lawn
and waving to them.

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:11.191
FEMALE SPEAKER: And
you had no idea though.

00:16:11.191 --> 00:16:13.467
That user actually jogged
your memory of that?

00:16:13.467 --> 00:16:15.300
Or did you know that
they were in the video?

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:15.736
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC:
Oh, no, I was

00:16:15.736 --> 00:16:16.530
well aware they
were in my video.

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:18.030
FEMALE SPEAKER: You
were well aware?

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:21.695
It seemed like you
were surprised.

00:16:21.695 --> 00:16:23.570
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC:
They'd been on "Mad TV,"

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:25.920
but they didn't have their
Comedy Central show, which

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:27.620
is really funny because
every now and then I'll still

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:29.626
get people tweeting me
going, Key and Peele were

00:16:29.626 --> 00:16:30.440
in your video.

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:31.286
Like, yeah, I know.

00:16:31.286 --> 00:16:31.785
I know.

00:16:33.489 --> 00:16:35.780
FEMALE SPEAKER: Another thing
that's really interesting

00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:40.160
is your shows draw in an
audience with a huge age range.

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:43.230
And even in this room we
have kids and Googlers and--

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:44.601
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:52.100
Do you feel like you have
to ever censor yourself

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:55.196
because you have
such a wide audience?

00:16:55.196 --> 00:16:56.570
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC:
I'm aware of

00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:58.760
the multi-generational
nature of my audience.

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:01.470
And I know that a lot of
young kids listen to it.

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:03.580
And so there's a fine line.

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:05.785
I mean, my music is an
extension of my personality.

00:17:05.785 --> 00:17:08.150
And I don't use profanity
in everyday life,

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:10.410
so I don't use it in the music.

00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:12.950
Some of my stuff gets a
little bit sick and twisted.

00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:14.970
I wouldn't say that
all of my music

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:18.740
is suitable for a six-year-old.

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:21.190
I'm not like Raffi
or the Wiggles.

00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:22.839
There's a little
bit of edge to it.

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:25.349
But I think it falls under
the general umbrella of family

00:17:25.349 --> 00:17:25.849
friendly.

00:17:25.849 --> 00:17:30.160
So I like to think of
myself like "The Simpsons"

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:30.727
in that way.

00:17:30.727 --> 00:17:32.810
There's a bit of an edge
to it, but your grandma's

00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:34.694
not going to soil
her panties over it.

00:17:34.694 --> 00:17:36.110
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Well, at this time

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:38.502
I want to invite anyone that
has a question for Al to go

00:17:38.502 --> 00:17:39.710
ahead and line up at the mic.

00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:42.360
And we'll just ask a few more
questions in the meantime

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:44.576
before we turn to
the audience here.

00:17:44.576 --> 00:17:46.550
But I want to ask you
about what's next.

00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:49.450
So your record contract
is coming to a close,

00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:52.100
and there has been a
lot of speculation on

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:54.810
if this will be your last
traditional album or not.

00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:56.490
Obviously there's
a lot of benefits

00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:59.860
towards digital
distribution with relevancy.

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:03.690
But is there anything that you
learned from this week around

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:07.000
how excited people were and
the buildup of the release that

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.302
has weighed on that
decision at all?

00:18:09.302 --> 00:18:11.760
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: I have to
wait for the dust to settle.

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:14.190
I mean, this has been
an extraordinary week.

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:17.460
And the album's
doing extremely well.

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:19.740
But having said that,
I still hold firm

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:21.810
to the idea that
digital distribution

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:23.975
and maybe releasing
singles instead of albums

00:18:23.975 --> 00:18:26.300
is the way to go moving forward.

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:29.640
I hate to make any big decisions
or draw a line in the sand

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.250
because things change.

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:32.900
And they do.

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:35.455
But it's still looking that way
for me that going forward I'm

00:18:35.455 --> 00:18:36.830
probably going to
be more focused

00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:38.150
on being a singles artist.

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:39.316
FEMALE SPEAKER: Interesting.

00:18:39.316 --> 00:18:41.060
And then what about
"Mandatory Fun" tour?

00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:42.040
Do we have that to
look forward to?

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:42.390
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC:
There will be

00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:43.950
a "Mandatory" tour by all means.

00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:44.741
FEMALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:18:44.741 --> 00:18:45.830
Do we have any other--

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:46.320
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: Next year.

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:47.180
FEMALE SPEAKER: Next year.

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:47.540
OK.

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:48.366
Something to look forward to.

00:18:48.366 --> 00:18:48.780
Awesome.

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:50.040
Well, we have some questions.

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:51.706
We'll go ahead and
turn to the audience.

00:18:51.706 --> 00:18:52.759
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: OK.

00:18:52.759 --> 00:18:53.300
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:57.380
A big fan of yours from the
early days of Dr. Demento.

00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:59.590
I'm a child of the '80s.

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:01.309
Congratulations on your success.

00:19:01.309 --> 00:19:02.600
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: Thank you.

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:04.060
AUDIENCE: And I
was just wondering

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:09.000
when you do these parodies
are you re-recording

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.010
the music behind it?

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:13.110
Or are you doing the vocals
over the existing music

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:16.029
because for some songs it
sounds dead on and I can't tell.

00:19:16.029 --> 00:19:17.320
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: Thank you.

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:19.861
Well, that comes from working
with extremely talented people.

00:19:19.861 --> 00:19:21.900
I've had the same band,
the exact same guys,

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:22.980
since the early '80s.

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:24.880
They're the same guys
on all the records.

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:27.250
They're the same guys that
are with me out on tour.

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:28.800
And they're just
amazing musicians.

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:32.500
They do everything from
gangsta rap to polka music.

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:33.320
They're phenomenal.

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:34.510
And thank you for that.

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:36.010
I sometimes don't
feel like they get

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:38.780
the credit they deserve
because they do comedy music.

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:40.430
And some people
think because it's

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:43.006
comedy it can't necessarily
have that much craft behind it,

00:19:43.006 --> 00:19:44.630
but they are some of
the best musicians

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:45.600
that you're likely to find.

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:46.620
AUDIENCE: That's truly amazing.

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:47.120
Thank you.

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:49.229
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: Thank you.

00:19:49.229 --> 00:19:49.770
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:50.940
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: Hello.

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:52.314
AUDIENCE: I just
want to tell you

00:19:52.314 --> 00:19:54.800
I'm literally a lifelong fan.

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:58.232
My mom was-- when I was-- yeah.

00:19:58.232 --> 00:19:59.566
A lot of "Weird Al" at my house.

00:19:59.566 --> 00:20:00.732
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: Got it.

00:20:00.732 --> 00:20:02.140
AUDIENCE: A lot of "Weird Al."

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:03.620
My question was, you
did talk a little bit

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:05.600
about the multi-generational
audience you have

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.700
which is phenomenal
because now I'm a mom

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:10.220
and my son now only loves your
book but loves your music.

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:11.570
"Yoda" is his favorite song.

00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:13.830
It's like a whole
thing at our house.

00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:18.990
But I was wondering
about the educational--

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:21.940
you have a lot of educational
value to a lot of your music.

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:25.380
And, in fact, you've taught
me that the corpus callosum

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:28.910
is totally awesome--
things that I didn't even

00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:30.620
know about the human body.

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:32.630
But I was wondering
if that's something

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:35.120
that you intended to
do from the beginning,

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:38.020
or just because you're this
really brilliant smart guy,

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:40.484
it just comes out in your music?

00:20:40.484 --> 00:20:42.900
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: It's not
part of my mission statement

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:45.620
to make my songs educational.

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:49.190
They're meant to just be
funny and entertaining.

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:52.120
But every now and then you
get a little bit of a lesson

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.760
in there. "Word
Crimes" is full a lot

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:58.310
of things for people that
need to be tutored on grammar.

00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:02.232
And my song "Foil" talks about
the many uses of aluminum foil.

00:21:02.232 --> 00:21:03.690
FEMALE SPEAKER:
And the Illuminati.

00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:05.120
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC:
Yes, yes, so it's

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:06.536
more of a byproduct
than something

00:21:06.536 --> 00:21:08.635
I'm directly going for,
but I always appreciate it

00:21:08.635 --> 00:21:10.510
when people can glean
something from my lyrics.

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:11.093
AUDIENCE: Yup.

00:21:11.093 --> 00:21:12.220
A lot of educational value.

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:13.136
But thank you so much.

00:21:13.136 --> 00:21:15.310
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: Thank you.

00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:15.910
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:16.469
Big fan.

00:21:16.469 --> 00:21:17.760
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: Thank you.

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:19.134
AUDIENCE: I just
want to know out

00:21:19.134 --> 00:21:21.350
of all the albums you've
released, what song was

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:24.280
the most fun to
write and record?

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:26.520
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: Oh gosh.

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:27.290
It's hard to say.

00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:29.287
I mean, my default answer
is "White and Nerdy"

00:21:29.287 --> 00:21:31.203
just because that's the
most autobiographical.

00:21:31.203 --> 00:21:33.505
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:33.505 --> 00:21:35.880
I didn't have to do a whole
lot of research for that one.

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:38.180
I lived the life.

00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:40.865
AUDIENCE: And, by the way,
Shatner's better than Picard.

00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:44.840
AUDIENCE: Hey, how's it going?

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:45.881
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: Hey.

00:21:45.881 --> 00:21:49.160
AUDIENCE: So I like to read a
lot of rock autobiographies.

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:52.100
And especially one
from the '80s involving

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:53.420
backstage hijinks and whatnot.

00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:56.710
I noticed there's no "Weird Al"
autobiography to my knowledge.

00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:57.590
There isn't, right?

00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:58.850
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC:
Well, there's

00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:01.266
a book that came out a couple
years ago called, "Weird Al:

00:22:01.266 --> 00:22:01.780
The Book."

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:03.120
It was written by Nathan Rabin.

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:04.620
So it's not really
an autobiography.

00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:05.940
But he interviewed me for it.

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:08.670
I didn't really want to write an
autobiography because I pretty

00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:10.960
much told every anecdote and
story about myself that I ever

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:11.459
wanted to.

00:22:11.459 --> 00:22:14.020
There's no hidden secrets
or skeletons in the closet.

00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:16.200
And I just wanted him
to do the heavy lifting.

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:20.830
So that's basically the
definitive life story to date.

00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:22.096
But Nathan actually wrote it.

00:22:22.096 --> 00:22:22.720
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:24.510
The reason I was asking
is because I just

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:27.340
want to know is there like one
story that could really get you

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:27.840
in trouble.

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:30.188
Some backstage like crazy story.

00:22:30.188 --> 00:22:31.184
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:31.184 --> 00:22:33.080
Do you want to share it with--

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:33.580
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC:
All the people

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:35.246
that know about that
story are dead now.

00:22:35.246 --> 00:22:37.380
So I think-- sorry.

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:38.005
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:22:38.005 --> 00:22:40.130
We're just a bunch of kids
that control the world's

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:41.768
information, so
you could tell us.

00:22:41.768 --> 00:22:43.638
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:43.638 --> 00:22:44.138
No?

00:22:44.138 --> 00:22:45.304
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: Thanks.

00:22:45.304 --> 00:22:46.138
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:22:46.138 --> 00:22:48.178
MALE SPEAKER: So we have
some questions coming in

00:22:48.178 --> 00:22:49.500
from the live stream as well.

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:51.660
From Google offices and
the internets worldwide.

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:55.110
So Tom Russ is wondering, what
is the secret to sustaining

00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:57.572
an entertainment career
over such a long time?

00:22:57.572 --> 00:22:59.280
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC:
Well, I attribute it

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:00.821
to working with very
talented people.

00:23:00.821 --> 00:23:02.946
I surround myself with
people that are very skilled

00:23:02.946 --> 00:23:04.112
and know what they're doing.

00:23:04.112 --> 00:23:05.140
And I mentioned my band.

00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:07.160
I've been with them
since the beginning.

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:09.320
I work with talented engineers.

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:10.540
I've got talented management.

00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:12.754
I've got people that
make me look good.

00:23:12.754 --> 00:23:14.420
On top of that I like
to think that I've

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:15.711
got a pretty strong work ethic.

00:23:15.711 --> 00:23:18.870
I put a lot of attention to
detail in everything that I do.

00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:20.127
A lot of sheer tenacity.

00:23:20.127 --> 00:23:21.460
And a whole lot of luck as well.

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:22.251
MALE SPEAKER: Cool.

00:23:22.251 --> 00:23:25.320
And do you still have
100 gigabytes of RAM?

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:27.420
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: Oh.

00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:27.940
Yes.

00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:28.545
Yeah, sure I do.

00:23:28.545 --> 00:23:29.545
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:23:29.545 --> 00:23:30.273
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:30.273 --> 00:23:33.040
Thanks.

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:33.740
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:35.070
Just a quick question.

00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:38.010
I was curious what you thought
of some of the other parody

00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:40.500
bands that are popular
recently today.

00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:41.970
Like Lonely Island.

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:44.165
Tenacious D. Bands like that.

00:23:44.165 --> 00:23:45.790
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC:
I love those guys.

00:23:45.790 --> 00:23:49.245
I mean, I'm good
friends with both.

00:23:49.245 --> 00:23:50.120
I'd add to that list.

00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:52.550
Lonely Island, Tenacious
D, Flight of the Conchords,

00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:55.820
Garfunkel and Oates, Bo Burnham,
Reggie Watts, Tim Minchin,

00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:56.535
Hard 'n Phirm.

00:23:56.535 --> 00:23:59.010
I mean, there's a lot of people
doing great, great comedy

00:23:59.010 --> 00:23:59.690
music out there.

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:01.540
And I don't look at
them as competition.

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:02.748
I look at them as my friends.

00:24:02.748 --> 00:24:04.873
And we're all carrying the
banner for comedy music.

00:24:04.873 --> 00:24:07.081
FEMALE SPEAKER: Would you
ever do a big collaboration

00:24:07.081 --> 00:24:08.487
with all of them you think?

00:24:08.487 --> 00:24:09.570
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: Sure.

00:24:09.570 --> 00:24:09.650
Yeah.

00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:10.439
We can do a big "We
Are The World"--

00:24:10.439 --> 00:24:10.938
FEMALE SPEAKER: Let's start it.

00:24:10.938 --> 00:24:11.563
Let's start it.

00:24:11.563 --> 00:24:12.934
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:15.897 --> 00:24:16.730
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:17.250
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: Thank you.

00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:18.573
AUDIENCE: Hey, I'm back.

00:24:18.573 --> 00:24:19.014
FEMALE SPEAKER: Round two.

00:24:19.014 --> 00:24:19.455
OK.

00:24:19.455 --> 00:24:19.896
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: Oh.

00:24:19.896 --> 00:24:22.021
AUDIENCE: So I'm just a
very curious guy about you.

00:24:22.021 --> 00:24:24.754
So you talked about
"UHF" earlier.

00:24:24.754 --> 00:24:26.670
I mean do you ever take
credit for discovering

00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:27.740
Michael Richards?

00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:28.823
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: Nope.

00:24:28.823 --> 00:24:29.610
AUDIENCE: No?

00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:30.130
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC:
Well, I mean,

00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:31.880
that he was already
on the show "Fridays."

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:34.744
It was ABC's version of
"Saturday Night Live."

00:24:34.744 --> 00:24:36.160
And he was popular
from that show.

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:38.099
And he was a very
popular entertainer

00:24:38.099 --> 00:24:39.140
on the LA stand-up scene.

00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:42.200
So it wasn't like that
was his first exposure.

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:44.760
He was definitely a rising star.

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:46.810
And I couldn't
imagine anybody else

00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:49.010
pulling off the Stanley
Spadowski character.

00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:52.180
I mean, he had a great
sense of physical comedy.

00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:54.312
He was Stanley Spadowski.

00:24:54.312 --> 00:24:55.020
AUDIENCE: He was.

00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:56.492
All right.

00:24:56.492 --> 00:24:56.992
Good stuff.

00:24:59.950 --> 00:25:03.077
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm also
a very long time fan.

00:25:03.077 --> 00:25:05.660
"The Food Album" was one of the
first albums I was ever given.

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:08.550
And a number of the songs on
that I had no idea there was

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:10.130
a non-"Weird Al"
version for years.

00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:12.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:14.530
Like the first time I heard
"My Sharona" on the radio,

00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:17.000
I'm like, this sounds
like "Weird Al."

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:17.880
That's weird.

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:19.030
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC:
I want to stop you.

00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:20.110
I know you got a
question, but I got

00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:21.730
to stop you just
because I've heard

00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:23.230
that story from a lot of people.

00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:27.130
And it tickles me because I
had a parody of "American Pie"

00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:29.970
about "Star Wars" which was
a big hit on Radio Disney.

00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:31.890
And all the kids on
Radio Disney didn't

00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:35.640
realize it was a parody of
a 1970s song by Don McLean.

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:38.610
They thought it was just a funny
"Star Wars" song by "Weird Al."

00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:41.450
So the year after my parody
came out, for some reason

00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:45.130
Madonna decides to do a disco
version of "American Pie."

00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:46.605
And all these kids
are going, how

00:25:46.605 --> 00:25:49.990
come Madonna's doing an unfunny
version of a "Weird Al" song?

00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:51.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:53.489 --> 00:25:54.780
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: I'm sorry.

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:55.615
Go ahead.

00:25:55.615 --> 00:25:57.790
AUDIENCE: No, that's fantastic.

00:25:57.790 --> 00:26:02.320
So my question is, you've been
doing this for so long now.

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:05.130
And a lot of the people that
you parody are coming up-- Lorde

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:06.720
is like 17.

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:10.300
Do you ever run into or
you go to talk to somebody

00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:13.507
about a parody, and they're
like, "Weird Al," who's that?

00:26:13.507 --> 00:26:15.090
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC:
Not my knowledge.

00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:15.590
I mean--

00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:18.028
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:18.028 --> 00:26:21.305
I did meet Iggy Azalea to
get her permission in person.

00:26:21.305 --> 00:26:22.871
And in fact, DMZ
documented that.

00:26:22.871 --> 00:26:24.120
AUDIENCE: I saw that actually.

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:25.640
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC:
And people were

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:27.540
wondering like, well, did
she know who you were?

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:28.580
And I was like,
well, I don't know.

00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:29.870
I don't start off with
the conversation with,

00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:30.745
do you know who I am?

00:26:30.745 --> 00:26:32.016
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:32.016 --> 00:26:35.930
So I mean, it was all
very cordial and polite.

00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:38.400
And she approved it.

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:39.910
I don't assume anything.

00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:43.150
But I think probably most
people in the music business

00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:44.940
have some working
knowledge of what I do.

00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:45.900
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:46.400
Thank you.

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:47.410
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: Thank you.

00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:49.285
FEMALE SPEAKER: And when
you went to see Iggy

00:26:49.285 --> 00:26:51.575
you actually flew to
Denver to her show.

00:26:51.575 --> 00:26:52.210
Is that right?

00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:53.930
Is that the longest
length that you've

00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:55.389
gone to get somebody's
blessing or?

00:26:55.389 --> 00:26:56.763
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC:
It might be.

00:26:56.763 --> 00:26:57.730
Yeah.

00:26:57.730 --> 00:26:59.850
The reason I did
that was because I

00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:01.430
had 11 songs in the can.

00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:03.390
And I was waiting
for the twelfth one

00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:05.760
to be a parody of whatever
the song of the summer was.

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:08.460
And when I heard "Fancy" and
saw it going up the charts,

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:10.030
I thought, OK, this is it.

00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:11.480
So I wrote the song.

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:14.460
I arranged for the recording
dates and the mastering date.

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:18.407
And we had the whole release
planned for the album.

00:27:18.407 --> 00:27:20.490
But then we weren't hearing
back from her manager.

00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:22.114
And the calls weren't
getting returned.

00:27:22.114 --> 00:27:24.020
And the clock was ticking.

00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:27.150
And finally I said, well,
I gotta just talk to Iggy.

00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:33.346
So I got on a plane, and I
flew to Denver on Friday.

00:27:33.346 --> 00:27:35.720
And we were scheduled to record
the song the next morning

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:36.960
in Los Angeles.

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:39.390
So it was like if I
didn't get her permission

00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:41.780
the whole album would have
been put on indefinite hold.

00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:43.810
And thankfully it worked out.

00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:46.230
I mean, I got her as she
was walking offstage.

00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:47.510
And I said, oh, Iggy, hi.

00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:48.510
I'm "Weird Al" Yankovic.

00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:51.520
And I would love to do a
parody of your song "Fancy."

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:53.110
And are you OK with that?

00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:56.657
And she said, well, I
need to have a little bit

00:27:56.657 --> 00:27:57.365
more information.

00:27:57.365 --> 00:27:59.430
I said, I happen to have
the lyrics right here.

00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:00.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:01.590
FEMALE SPEAKER: And
she looked at me

00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:03.634
and she's like,
yeah, looks fine.

00:28:03.634 --> 00:28:04.300
And that was it.

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:07.295
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:07.295 --> 00:28:09.420
AUDIENCE: I always liked
your song "Jurassic Park."

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:11.850
And the video was so
great with the claymation.

00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:15.350
And I've had a fascination all
my life with the original song,

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:16.660
Jimmy Webb's "MacArthur Park."

00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:19.284
And I wondered if while you were
working on that if you came up

00:28:19.284 --> 00:28:22.490
with interpretations about
what the original meant.

00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:24.520
The cake and the
rain and all of that.

00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:25.980
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: I didn't
think too much about that.

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:28.354
I mean, I'm sure Jimmy Webb
had his-- I mean, people have

00:28:28.354 --> 00:28:30.849
theorized about
that for decades.

00:28:30.849 --> 00:28:32.390
And I became friends
with Jimmy Webb.

00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:36.630
In fact, he gave me a dinosaur
head to commemorate the parody.

00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:39.850
And I got to perform--
oh, yeah, I remember that.

00:28:39.850 --> 00:28:41.349
Jimmy Webb had a
show at The Roxy.

00:28:41.349 --> 00:28:42.890
And at the end of
the show he started

00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:45.080
playing "MacArthur Park."

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:46.580
And he played the
first couple lines

00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:48.590
then he pretended like
he forgot the words.

00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:51.030
He does, can anybody else
sing the song for me?

00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:53.480
And I come out from the wings
and I do "Jurassic Park."

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:55.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:56.450
But Jimmy was a great fan.

00:28:56.450 --> 00:28:57.949
But he never sat
me down and told me

00:28:57.949 --> 00:28:59.570
what "MacArthur
Park" was all about.

00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:00.010
AUDIENCE: Mystery.

00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:00.510
OK.

00:29:02.624 --> 00:29:04.290
AUDIENCE: I have a
second question here.

00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:07.970
Going back to the stair climbing
and the costume changing,

00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:09.840
what's the "Weird
Al" exercise routine?

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:12.900
How do you stay in shape
and make that happen?

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:15.190
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: Well,
I had my skeleton removed,

00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:18.440
so I can just flop
all over the place.

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:22.420
My exercise is basically when
I'm on the road it's the show.

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:24.540
That's my aerobic workout.

00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:27.050
And when I try to lose
weight or try to get in shape

00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:28.760
or get my cardio up--

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:29.970
I'm not a gym guy.

00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:31.230
I just can't go to the gym.

00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:33.809
It's not fun or appealing to me.

00:29:33.809 --> 00:29:34.600
But I like walking.

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:38.630
So I'll walk from my house
in the hills five miles down

00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:42.700
to Wilshire Boulevard and back
up again with my headphones

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:45.170
on and just rocking
out down the street.

00:29:45.170 --> 00:29:46.970
So that's my favorite
kind of exercise.

00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:47.678
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:29:50.842 --> 00:29:51.516
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:29:51.516 --> 00:29:52.890
First, I just
wanted to thank you

00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:55.470
for basically being the
soundtrack to my teenage years.

00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:56.142
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:56.142 --> 00:29:57.580
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC:
My pleasure.

00:29:57.580 --> 00:29:59.480
AUDIENCE: I remember
buying "Alapalooza" back

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:01.795
when they still worried
about selling CDs in stores.

00:30:01.795 --> 00:30:04.170
And there was the sticker on
it reminding people no, this

00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:07.040
is not in fact the "Jurassic
Park" soundtrack for--

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:07.240
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: Right.

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:08.780
It was an afterthought
from the legal department,

00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:09.900
like, there are a
lot of stupid people.

00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:11.108
You better put that on there.

00:30:11.108 --> 00:30:13.292
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:13.292 --> 00:30:14.750
AUDIENCE: But my
questions is just,

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:16.208
you've been doing
this for so long.

00:30:16.208 --> 00:30:18.360
What's the biggest
difference between doing

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:21.907
it now and when you were
getting started in the '80s?

00:30:21.907 --> 00:30:24.240
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: Mostly
it's all about distribution.

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:26.470
I mean, you pointed out
or alluded to the fact

00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:29.030
that record stores by and
large don't exist anymore.

00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:33.090
There's just a few remaining
people keeping the faith.

00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:35.210
But it's all done
online, whether it's

00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:40.430
Amazon or other digital
portals like iTunes.

00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:42.960
So it's just a matter of the
way that music is marketed

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:44.390
and the way that
it's distributed.

00:30:44.390 --> 00:30:45.920
But music is music.

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:47.560
And that changes
as well, of course.

00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:49.180
Pop culture is always changing.

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:51.630
But I think the most
radical changes have just

00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:55.537
been in the way that the
music itself is consumed.

00:30:55.537 --> 00:30:57.870
AUDIENCE: So the difference
is in how people consume it,

00:30:57.870 --> 00:30:59.895
not necessarily
how you produce it.

00:30:59.895 --> 00:31:01.728
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC:
Well, a little of both.

00:31:01.728 --> 00:31:04.290
I mean, when I started out--
I grew up in the analog days.

00:31:04.290 --> 00:31:08.890
So I used to record stuff
on a 24 track analog tape.

00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:11.110
And nowadays it's all digital.

00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:13.870
So I can play around
with things indefinitely,

00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:17.230
like moving waveforms around and
making things a little bit more

00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:19.591
perfect than I would
have been able to do back

00:31:19.591 --> 00:31:20.590
when I was starting out.

00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:22.750
So I spend the
same amount of time

00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:24.230
working on things as I used to.

00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:27.890
But now I get into the
really nitty-gritty details.

00:31:27.890 --> 00:31:29.040
I'm pretty OCD that way.

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:30.710
So I can spend a lot of
time working on things.

00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:31.543
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:31:34.649 --> 00:31:35.190
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:37.987
Like everybody else, I grew
up listening to your music.

00:31:37.987 --> 00:31:39.570
Listened to Dr.
Demento over and over.

00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:41.210
Just had one tape
that my friend had.

00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:42.210
Bootlegged.

00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:44.820
Listened to it over and over.

00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:48.910
But I recently went
to Maui with my wife.

00:31:48.910 --> 00:31:51.400
And we took the
bus tour to Hana.

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:54.980
And we heard a story about
you and the pedestrian

00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:57.290
crossing signs.

00:31:57.290 --> 00:31:58.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:58.730 --> 00:31:59.830
Is it not true?

00:31:59.830 --> 00:32:02.620
So all the pedestrian crossing
signs, or a bunch of them,

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:06.050
had little hula hoops, like
stickered on top of it.

00:32:06.050 --> 00:32:08.460
And the guide said
that was your doing.

00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:09.370
Was that really you?

00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:10.410
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: No.

00:32:10.410 --> 00:32:10.909
No.

00:32:10.909 --> 00:32:11.784
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:11.784 --> 00:32:12.825
FEMALE SPEAKER: Imposter.

00:32:12.825 --> 00:32:14.330
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: No.

00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:17.086
My vacation home is in Maui.

00:32:17.086 --> 00:32:20.050
But I was not responsible
for those stickers.

00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:21.700
Maybe the story's
getting confused.

00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:26.000
I had a YouTube video
where I drove around Maui

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.116
changing the road signs.

00:32:28.116 --> 00:32:29.740
There was a sign that
says, drive slow.

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:32.198
And I stopped the car and I
get a little LY and put slowly.

00:32:35.379 --> 00:32:37.170
But I'm not responsible
for the hula hoops.

00:32:37.170 --> 00:32:38.105
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:32:38.105 --> 00:32:40.230
FEMALE SPEAKER: Was that
the original "Word Crime"?

00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:41.177
That whole incident?

00:32:41.177 --> 00:32:41.355
Yeah.

00:32:41.355 --> 00:32:42.688
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: Well, yeah.

00:32:42.688 --> 00:32:47.505
My grammar nerd cred is
firmly established already.

00:32:47.505 --> 00:32:49.380
AUDIENCE: I have a short
anecdote rather than

00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:50.080
a question.

00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:51.079
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: OK.

00:32:51.079 --> 00:32:52.950
AUDIENCE: So last
year I got married.

00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:53.790
And when we were
trying to figure out

00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:56.206
what music I cared about having
at the wedding, of course,

00:32:56.206 --> 00:32:57.970
I wanted to have "Weird Al."

00:32:57.970 --> 00:33:00.370
So in talking with
the DJ the directive

00:33:00.370 --> 00:33:03.510
we gave was, OK any song
that has a "Weird Al" parody,

00:33:03.510 --> 00:33:05.340
play that instead of
the original version.

00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:06.460
And one of the
highlights of the wedding

00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:08.421
was people realizing
halfway through "Eat It"

00:33:08.421 --> 00:33:10.504
that it was "Weird Al"
instead of Michael Jackson.

00:33:10.504 --> 00:33:11.352
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:11.352 --> 00:33:11.776
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: Nice.

00:33:11.776 --> 00:33:12.276
Very nice.

00:33:12.276 --> 00:33:13.280
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:14.571
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: Thank you.

00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:18.590
AUDIENCE: Hi again.

00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:19.500
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: Hello.

00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:21.670
AUDIENCE: So we were just
talking about the media

00:33:21.670 --> 00:33:25.950
distribution and how that's
changed over the past 20

00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:28.490
something-- five-- years.

00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:30.490
So I noticed that
with your videos

00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:34.460
this week you've been picking
different sites to host them

00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:35.960
on.

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:38.430
Can you explain a little
bit behind that decision?

00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:40.840
And I guess a second
part of that question

00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:43.862
is are the videos eventually
going to be all on YouTube?

00:33:43.862 --> 00:33:45.445
Because that's where
we go for videos.

00:33:45.445 --> 00:33:47.068
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:47.068 --> 00:33:49.640
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: Yeah.

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:51.850
First of all, I put them
all on different portals

00:33:51.850 --> 00:33:53.480
because I wanted
to spread the love.

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:56.157
I wanted everybody to
feel ownership in it.

00:33:56.157 --> 00:33:58.490
And they would each have their
own video that they would

00:33:58.490 --> 00:34:01.270
promote and hopefully promote
all the other partners' videos

00:34:01.270 --> 00:34:02.690
as well.

00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:04.760
And they will all
eventually be on YouTube.

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:06.260
They will revert
back to the label.

00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:08.780
And the label's VEVO
channel will host them

00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:11.489
at that point as well as
the original partners.

00:34:11.489 --> 00:34:14.389
But the original partners
have an exclusivity window.

00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:16.510
So that was part of
the deal that the label

00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:20.330
made when we first
agreed to do it.

00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:22.460
But yeah, that's the
answer to your question.

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:24.940
Probably within two weeks
they'll all revert to YouTube.

00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:25.239
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:34:25.239 --> 00:34:25.739
Thanks.

00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:30.719
AUDIENCE: Well,
first you made me

00:34:30.719 --> 00:34:32.889
really jealous of my brother.

00:34:32.889 --> 00:34:35.750
See, I thought I had it cool
coming to work for Google

00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:39.760
while my brother was stuck down
here in Los Angeles working

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:43.563
for College Humor as
a producer on "Foil."

00:34:43.563 --> 00:34:45.479
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: Is
your brother Jon Wolf?

00:34:45.479 --> 00:34:46.260
AUDIENCE: Jon Wolf.

00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:46.690
Yes.

00:34:46.690 --> 00:34:47.170
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC:
Oh, excellent.

00:34:47.170 --> 00:34:48.295
And he's in the video, too.

00:34:48.295 --> 00:34:50.575
He's the guy going, ahh.

00:34:50.575 --> 00:34:51.949
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
I recognized him.

00:34:51.949 --> 00:34:53.401
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:57.464 --> 00:34:59.380
My question is what was
it like the first time

00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:01.270
you saw your face on
someone else's shirt?

00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:04.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:06.402
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: Pretty odd.

00:35:06.402 --> 00:35:08.610
The first time you see your
face on somebody's else's

00:35:08.610 --> 00:35:10.059
body it's always weird.

00:35:10.059 --> 00:35:11.850
What's even weirder
than that was the first

00:35:11.850 --> 00:35:16.210
I saw my face on
somebody's leg as a tattoo.

00:35:16.210 --> 00:35:17.710
That's even weirder
when you realize

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:19.035
that's permanent, right?

00:35:19.035 --> 00:35:19.878
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:19.878 --> 00:35:21.747
That doesn't wash off.

00:35:21.747 --> 00:35:22.580
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:23.746
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: Thanks.

00:35:26.409 --> 00:35:27.075
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:35:27.075 --> 00:35:27.600
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: Hello.

00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:29.225
AUDIENCE: I've been
a long time admirer

00:35:29.225 --> 00:35:30.740
of your beautiful,
beautiful locks.

00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:32.612
I was wondering what
hair products you use.

00:35:32.612 --> 00:35:33.332
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:33.332 --> 00:35:34.956
FEMALE SPEAKER: I
asked the same thing.

00:35:34.956 --> 00:35:36.720
Yeah, naturally curly hair.

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:37.692
It's beautiful.

00:35:37.692 --> 00:35:39.150
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC:
I wish I knew.

00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:41.483
I mean, I do throw stuff on
my hair when I'm washing it.

00:35:41.483 --> 00:35:43.910
But I couldn't even tell--
it's in the purple bottle

00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:44.620
in the shower.

00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:45.911
Whatever my wife puts in there.

00:35:45.911 --> 00:35:47.710
So I don't have a
brand name for you.

00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:48.210
Sorry.

00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:49.275
FEMALE SPEAKER: You might
have to brand something.

00:35:49.275 --> 00:35:50.890
I think there's a lot
of requests for that.

00:35:50.890 --> 00:35:51.890
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC: OK.

00:35:51.890 --> 00:35:53.122
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:53.122 --> 00:35:55.080
FEMALE SPEAKER: Well, I
think that was it then.

00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:56.510
Thank you so much for coming.

00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:58.330
This has been amazing.

00:35:58.330 --> 00:36:00.140
And we're going to
look forward to seeing

00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:03.020
the rest of the videos
and definitely information

00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:04.175
on the Mandatory Fun tour.

00:36:04.175 --> 00:36:04.853
"WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC:
Thanks so much.

00:36:04.853 --> 00:36:05.236
Appreciate that.
