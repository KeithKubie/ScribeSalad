going to talk about games how many of

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339
going to talk about games how many of
 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.549
going to talk about games how many of
you play games at all how many of you

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559

but i also want to talk about some of

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149
but i also want to talk about some of
 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.490
but i also want to talk about some of
the things that maybe we don't like to

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500
the things that maybe we don't like to
 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.350
the things that maybe we don't like to
talk about and i think one of the things

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360
talk about and i think one of the things
 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.819
talk about and i think one of the things
that doesn't come up when we're kind of

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829
that doesn't come up when we're kind of
 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.450
that doesn't come up when we're kind of
doing games boosterism is that um a lot

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460
doing games boosterism is that um a lot
 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.650
doing games boosterism is that um a lot
of games kind of feel the same and I'm

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660
of games kind of feel the same and I'm
 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.360
of games kind of feel the same and I'm
not sure I mean what you immediately

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370
not sure I mean what you immediately
 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.510
not sure I mean what you immediately
think I mean so for example an early

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520
think I mean so for example an early
 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.670

so collision movement physics we might

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950
so collision movement physics we might
 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.280
so collision movement physics we might

game I don't if you look at what's going

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069
game I don't if you look at what's going
 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.429
game I don't if you look at what's going
on in pac-man well you've got collision

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:43.439
on in pac-man well you've got collision
 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:45.500
on in pac-man well you've got collision
you can't run in part in two parts of

you can't run in part in two parts of
 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.720
you can't run in part in two parts of
the maze and you've got movement right

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730
the maze and you've got movement right
 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.849

recent games even the games that seem

00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:58.379
recent games even the games that seem
 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:00.289
recent games even the games that seem
kind of innovative a lot of them are

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299
kind of innovative a lot of them are
 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.960
kind of innovative a lot of them are
basically a celebration of these same

elements packaged in a new way so if you

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879
elements packaged in a new way so if you
 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:07.339
elements packaged in a new way so if you
think about something like Mirror's Edge

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349
think about something like Mirror's Edge
 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:09.649
think about something like Mirror's Edge
which is a parkour game right but it's

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:09.659
which is a parkour game right but it's
 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:12.020
which is a parkour game right but it's
basically a game of movement collision

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030
basically a game of movement collision
 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.080
basically a game of movement collision
detection and physics or a game like

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090
detection and physics or a game like
 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.330

calamari dama see right this is a game

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340
calamari dama see right this is a game
 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.280
calamari dama see right this is a game
where it's a very strange game that I

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290
where it's a very strange game that I
 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.869

recommend to all of you right where you

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:20.879
recommend to all of you right where you
 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:23.330
recommend to all of you right where you
roll things around and you collect more

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340
roll things around and you collect more
 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.860
roll things around and you collect more
and more of them and you get bigger and

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870
and more of them and you get bigger and
 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.659
and more of them and you get bigger and
bigger balls as you collect more and

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:26.669
bigger balls as you collect more and
 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:28.250
bigger balls as you collect more and
more things until eventually you're

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260
more things until eventually you're
 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.710
more things until eventually you're
collecting people's and people and cars

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720
collecting people's and people and cars
 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.199
collecting people's and people and cars
and islands and so on and you start out

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209
and islands and so on and you start out
 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:38.149

with like paper clips alright so how

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:38.159
with like paper clips alright so how
 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:40.220
with like paper clips alright so how
should we think about this right how do

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230
should we think about this right how do
 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.170
should we think about this right how do
we think about the fact that there's

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180
we think about the fact that there's
 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.569
we think about the fact that there's
something similar at the heart of so

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579
something similar at the heart of so
 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.640

usually talk about computer games in
 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:56.599
usually talk about computer games in
terms of genres right there's strategy

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609
terms of genres right there's strategy
 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:58.460
terms of genres right there's strategy
games there are first-person shooters

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470
games there are first-person shooters
 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.649
games there are first-person shooters
and so on but these games are all in

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:00.659
and so on but these games are all in
 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:03.500
and so on but these games are all in
different genres so that's not how we

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510
different genres so that's not how we
 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:04.879
different genres so that's not how we
can think about this sort of deep

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:04.889
can think about this sort of deep
 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:07.909
can think about this sort of deep
similarity usually the sort of next

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:07.919
similarity usually the sort of next
 

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:10.280
similarity usually the sort of next

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290
level down Oh game analysis is not John
 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.020
level down Oh game analysis is not John
rabe of mechanics right what are the

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030
rabe of mechanics right what are the
 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.960
rabe of mechanics right what are the
things that make the game operate what

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970
things that make the game operate what
 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.439
things that make the game operate what
are the the rules that the player

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:17.449
are the the rules that the player
 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:20.990
are the the rules that the player
experiences when they play but again

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000
experiences when they play but again
 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.379
experiences when they play but again
these mechanics are really diverse from

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389
these mechanics are really diverse from
 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:26.150
these mechanics are really diverse from
each other right what's being done

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160
each other right what's being done
 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.560
each other right what's being done
on um is it is quite different so you

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570
on um is it is quite different so you
 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.840
on um is it is quite different so you
know maybe it's something deeper right

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850
know maybe it's something deeper right
 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.000
know maybe it's something deeper right
maybe that's how we can think about this

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010
maybe that's how we can think about this
 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.850
maybe that's how we can think about this
similarity and then as as you might

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860
similarity and then as as you might
 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.010
similarity and then as as you might
guess right I'm going to this familiar

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020
guess right I'm going to this familiar
 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.380

question which for those of you who

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390
question which for those of you who
 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.510
question which for those of you who
think about digital media kind of comes

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520
think about digital media kind of comes
 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.840
think about digital media kind of comes
up again and again in different guises

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850
up again and again in different guises
 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.090
up again and again in different guises
which is basically how do we think about

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100
which is basically how do we think about
 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.960
which is basically how do we think about
the inside of digital media right so we

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970
the inside of digital media right so we
 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.910
the inside of digital media right so we
kind of know from thinking about other

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:55.920
kind of know from thinking about other
 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.710
kind of know from thinking about other
media some way we might think about

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720
media some way we might think about
 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.290
media some way we might think about
audiences we know from other kinds of

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300
audiences we know from other kinds of
 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.670
audiences we know from other kinds of
media some ways we might think about

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680
media some ways we might think about
 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.610
media some ways we might think about
what appears on the surface right what's

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620
what appears on the surface right what's
 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.370
what appears on the surface right what's
the interface but how do we think about

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380
the interface but how do we think about
 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.520
the interface but how do we think about
the inside it seems really perplexing to

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530
the inside it seems really perplexing to
 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:11.990
the inside it seems really perplexing to
a lot of people who in sort of the

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000
a lot of people who in sort of the
 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.270
a lot of people who in sort of the
digital media field right so some people

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280
digital media field right so some people
 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.830
digital media field right so some people
might say well you know maybe zeros and

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840
might say well you know maybe zeros and
 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.720
might say well you know maybe zeros and
ones way oh this is supposed to be on

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:17.730
ones way oh this is supposed to be on
 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.660

the cover of Sadie plants book which is

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:20.670
the cover of Sadie plants book which is
 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:22.130
the cover of Sadie plants book which is
called zeros and ones right so maybe

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.140
called zeros and ones right so maybe
 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.500
called zeros and ones right so maybe
binary arithmetic is really central

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510
binary arithmetic is really central
 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:25.730
binary arithmetic is really central
right maybe if we could just get a

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740
right maybe if we could just get a
 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.530
right maybe if we could just get a
handle on the sort of the fact that

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:27.540
handle on the sort of the fact that
 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.440
handle on the sort of the fact that
things are stored that way maybe that

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.450
things are stored that way maybe that
 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.470
things are stored that way maybe that
would tell us something not many people

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:33.480
would tell us something not many people
 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.000
would tell us something not many people
i think argue that very seriously

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010
i think argue that very seriously
 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:38.450
i think argue that very seriously
anymore I think a lot more seriously

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460
anymore I think a lot more seriously
 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.880
anymore I think a lot more seriously
people argue this sort of uncompelled

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:40.890
people argue this sort of uncompelled
 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.850
people argue this sort of uncompelled
source code is key if we could just

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860
source code is key if we could just
 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.490
source code is key if we could just
start interpreting code maybe we would

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500
start interpreting code maybe we would
 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.320
start interpreting code maybe we would
understand digital media more deeply and

the rise models for how we might

00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580
the rise models for how we might
 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.930
the rise models for how we might
understand digital media and it's a

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:02.940
understand digital media and it's a
 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.900

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:05.910
model that I'm resistant toward and I
 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:08.210
model that I'm resistant toward and I
can think of my resistance probably in a

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.220
can think of my resistance probably in a
 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:09.980
can think of my resistance probably in a
number of ways but part of it I think is

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990
number of ways but part of it I think is
 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.230
number of ways but part of it I think is
just personal right like I've you know

research lab and if you came in while I

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:18.600
research lab and if you came in while I
 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.020
research lab and if you came in while I
was editing some code on my screen and

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.030
was editing some code on my screen and
 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:24.200
was editing some code on my screen and
said hey what are you working on what

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:24.210
said hey what are you working on what
 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:26.240
said hey what are you working on what
does that do and I said oh I'll print

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.250
does that do and I said oh I'll print
 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:28.220
does that do and I said oh I'll print
the code out for you and you can read it

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:28.230
the code out for you and you can read it
 

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:30.440
the code out for you and you can read it
over lunch right that would be a really

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:30.450
over lunch right that would be a really
 

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:32.630
over lunch right that would be a really
rude answer right that would basically

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:32.640
rude answer right that would basically
 

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.909
rude answer right that would basically
be a way of saying like go away you're

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:34.919
be a way of saying like go away you're
 

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:37.760
be a way of saying like go away you're
no because um well as those of us who

create code probably know all too

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:39.940

well one of the biggest ways to get a

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:41.770

software project to fail is to hand it

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:44.170
software project to fail is to hand it
 

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:46.320
software project to fail is to hand it
off from one program or to another right

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:46.330
off from one program or to another right
 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:49.380
off from one program or to another right
because code is not self explaining code

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:49.390
because code is not self explaining code
 

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:51.120
because code is not self explaining code
is actually often quite you know

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:51.130
is actually often quite you know
 

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:52.800
is actually often quite you know
obfuscated it and difficult to

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:52.810
obfuscated it and difficult to
 

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:54.600
obfuscated it and difficult to
understand and difficult to maintain and

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:54.610

our own code after six months often

00:06:58.890 --> 00:06:58.900
our own code after six months often
 

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.710
our own code after six months often
right so I really think this is this is

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:01.720
right so I really think this is this is
 

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.960
right so I really think this is this is
a confusion to think that really what we

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:03.970
a confusion to think that really what we
 

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:06.000
a confusion to think that really what we
want to be getting at is the code I

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:06.010
want to be getting at is the code I
 

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:07.740
want to be getting at is the code I
think there are other models that are

recent book expressive processing what I
 

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:15.990
recent book expressive processing what I
try to do is analyze things in terms of

try to do is analyze things in terms of
 

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.420
try to do is analyze things in terms of
their operational logics right so

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:18.430
their operational logics right so
 

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:20.730
their operational logics right so
sometimes I have had to resort to source

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:20.740
sometimes I have had to resort to source
 

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.880
sometimes I have had to resort to source
code as a way of identifying the

operational logics that I want to
discuss but there are lots of other

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:27.220
discuss but there are lots of other
 

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:29.340

anyway so I then that just sort of makes

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:41.010
anyway so I then that just sort of makes
 

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:42.440
anyway so I then that just sort of makes
me less hopeful than I should be um

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:42.450
me less hopeful than I should be um
 

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:44.930
me less hopeful than I should be um
anyway so this does have you know a kind

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:44.940
anyway so this does have you know a kind
 

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:47.030
anyway so this does have you know a kind
of a quite interesting story about

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:47.040
of a quite interesting story about
 

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.670
of a quite interesting story about
inevitability and it really in many ways

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:49.680
inevitability and it really in many ways
 

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.400
inevitability and it really in many ways
about the form of the game and the

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:52.410
about the form of the game and the
 

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:54.860
about the form of the game and the
mechanics of the game but the structure

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:54.870
mechanics of the game but the structure
 

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:57.830
mechanics of the game but the structure
of the game is this right so there are

00:09:57.830 --> 00:09:57.840
of the game is this right so there are
 

00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.800
of the game is this right so there are
all these sort of areas of play

00:09:59.800 --> 00:09:59.810
all these sort of areas of play
 

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:03.080
all these sort of areas of play
platforming play combat play and then

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:03.090
platforming play combat play and then
 

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:05.990
platforming play combat play and then
there are the moments in between where

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:06.000
there are the moments in between where
 

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.450
there are the moments in between where
fiction takes place right and play and

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:08.460
fiction takes place right and play and
 

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:12.200
fiction takes place right and play and
fiction kind of alternate I would argue

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:12.210
fiction kind of alternate I would argue
 

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:15.140
fiction kind of alternate I would argue
that games are really about what you do

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:15.150
that games are really about what you do
 

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:17.510
that games are really about what you do
when you're playing them and what you do

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:17.520
when you're playing them and what you do
 

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.220
when you're playing them and what you do
when you play Prince of Persia is not

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:19.230
when you play Prince of Persia is not
 

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:21.710
when you play Prince of Persia is not
the story right Prince of Persia is

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:21.720
the story right Prince of Persia is
 

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:24.560
the story right Prince of Persia is
about platforms and time mechanics and

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:24.570
about platforms and time mechanics and
 

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:26.330
about platforms and time mechanics and
so on and that's why it tells an

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:26.340
so on and that's why it tells an
 

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:28.220
so on and that's why it tells an
appropriate story for what it's about

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:28.230
appropriate story for what it's about
 

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:32.150
appropriate story for what it's about
but it's not really about its story and

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:32.160
but it's not really about its story and
 

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.280
but it's not really about its story and
I would say the same is true of the

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:34.290
I would say the same is true of the
 

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:36.860
I would say the same is true of the
half-life series the Uncharted series of

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:36.870
half-life series the Uncharted series of
 

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:38.870
half-life series the Uncharted series of
many games that are allotted for their

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:38.880
many games that are allotted for their
 

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.180
many games that are allotted for their
storytelling they have this structure

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:41.190
storytelling they have this structure
 

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:43.220
storytelling they have this structure
where you sort of experience a story

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:43.230
where you sort of experience a story
 

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:45.140
where you sort of experience a story
when you're not playing and then other

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:45.150
when you're not playing and then other
 

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:46.610
when you're not playing and then other
times when you're playing it's not a

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:46.620
times when you're playing it's not a
 

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:49.730
times when you're playing it's not a
story um and actually I might even argue

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:49.740
story um and actually I might even argue
 

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:50.930
story um and actually I might even argue
this for the current state of

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:50.940
this for the current state of
 

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:52.910
this for the current state of
role-playing games which are the closest

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:52.920
role-playing games which are the closest
 

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:56.030
role-playing games which are the closest
to trying to say use dialogue as a game

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:56.040
to trying to say use dialogue as a game
 

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:58.610
to trying to say use dialogue as a game
mechanic and if you're interested in my

00:10:58.610 --> 00:10:58.620
mechanic and if you're interested in my
 

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:00.440
mechanic and if you're interested in my
argument about current role playing

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:00.450
argument about current role playing
 

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:02.000
argument about current role playing
games I'm actually going to be giving

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:02.010
games I'm actually going to be giving
 

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:05.420
games I'm actually going to be giving
that on Wednesday I think at noon

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:05.430
that on Wednesday I think at noon
 

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:07.430
that on Wednesday I think at noon
so stick around afterwards and maybe we

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:07.440
so stick around afterwards and maybe we
 

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.829
so stick around afterwards and maybe we
can figure out exactly where anyway or

00:11:09.829 --> 00:11:09.839
can figure out exactly where anyway or
 

00:11:09.839 --> 00:11:11.300
can figure out exactly where anyway or
maybe actually searching online might be

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:11.310
maybe actually searching online might be
 

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:13.639
maybe actually searching online might be
a better way all right so let's say that

00:11:13.639 --> 00:11:13.649
a better way all right so let's say that
 

00:11:13.649 --> 00:11:16.820
a better way all right so let's say that
we have these logics right of collision

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:16.830
we have these logics right of collision
 

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:18.920
we have these logics right of collision
detection and movement and so on and I

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:18.930
detection and movement and so on and I
 

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:20.180
detection and movement and so on and I
say you know they're basically about

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:20.190
say you know they're basically about
 

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:22.070
say you know they're basically about
representing objects and objects running

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:22.080

into each other and that's what most

00:11:23.269 --> 00:11:23.279
into each other and that's what most
 

00:11:23.279 --> 00:11:25.610
into each other and that's what most
games are about well couldn't we just

00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:25.620
games are about well couldn't we just
 

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:28.370
games are about well couldn't we just
use those logics to represent something

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:28.380
use those logics to represent something
 

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:30.650
use those logics to represent something
else right yeah if this is an algorithm

00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:30.660
else right yeah if this is an algorithm
 

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:32.960
else right yeah if this is an algorithm
that's used to represent an idea what if

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:32.970
that's used to represent an idea what if
 

00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:35.120
that's used to represent an idea what if
we repurpose those algorithmic

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:35.130
we repurpose those algorithmic
 

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:36.790
we repurpose those algorithmic
representations for some other purpose

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:36.800
representations for some other purpose
 

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.170
representations for some other purpose
so I don't know how many of you have

00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:39.180
so I don't know how many of you have
 

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:43.430
so I don't know how many of you have
played jason wars passage okay ah so for

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:43.440
played jason wars passage okay ah so for
 

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:46.190
played jason wars passage okay ah so for
everyone but him um I am now going to

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:46.200
everyone but him um I am now going to
 

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:49.070
everyone but him um I am now going to
like give you spoilers for the game and

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:49.080
like give you spoilers for the game and
 

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.110
like give you spoilers for the game and
if you are someone for who likes to

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:51.120
if you are someone for who likes to
 

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.030
if you are someone for who likes to
avoid spoilers I guess you could have

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:53.040
avoid spoilers I guess you could have
 

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:55.970
avoid spoilers I guess you could have
close your ears and eyes for a moment so

00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:55.980
close your ears and eyes for a moment so
 

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:58.340
close your ears and eyes for a moment so
passage very deliberately is trying to

00:11:58.340 --> 00:11:58.350
passage very deliberately is trying to
 

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:01.010
passage very deliberately is trying to
take these well-known game logics and

00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:01.020
take these well-known game logics and
 

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:03.800
take these well-known game logics and
use them for some other purpose and has

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:03.810
use them for some other purpose and has
 

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:05.780
use them for some other purpose and has
this kind of 8-bit representational

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:05.790
this kind of 8-bit representational
 

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:08.300
this kind of 8-bit representational
style that it uses to kind of foreground

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:08.310
style that it uses to kind of foreground
 

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:11.240
style that it uses to kind of foreground
how sort of classic its underlying a

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:11.250
how sort of classic its underlying a
 

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:14.060
how sort of classic its underlying a
software system is so you play this

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:14.070
software system is so you play this
 

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:16.310
software system is so you play this
character and you can go and I sort of

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:16.320
character and you can go and I sort of
 

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:17.870
character and you can go and I sort of
explore the world and you can go through

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:17.880
explore the world and you can go through
 

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:21.410
explore the world and you can go through
these passageways and you can you know

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:21.420
these passageways and you can you know
 

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:23.120
these passageways and you can you know
get things that look like the typical

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:23.130
get things that look like the typical
 

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:25.130
get things that look like the typical
8-bit rewards right I discover this

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:25.140
8-bit rewards right I discover this
 

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:26.510
8-bit rewards right I discover this
treasure chest and there's this sort of

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:26.520
treasure chest and there's this sort of
 

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:28.850
treasure chest and there's this sort of
explosion of blue and a star comes out

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:28.860
explosion of blue and a star comes out
 

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:31.120
explosion of blue and a star comes out
and clearly I'm doing something right

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:31.130
and clearly I'm doing something right
 

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:34.190
and clearly I'm doing something right
you can also do this right you can sort

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:34.200
you can also do this right you can sort
 

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.650
you can also do this right you can sort
of keep going it that way instead of

00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:36.660
of keep going it that way instead of
 

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:39.829
of keep going it that way instead of
going down and you can get together with

00:12:39.829 --> 00:12:39.839
going down and you can get together with
 

00:12:39.839 --> 00:12:41.420
going down and you can get together with
your love interest right who's also

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:41.430
your love interest right who's also
 

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:45.079
your love interest right who's also
8-bit and the two of you can travel the

00:12:45.079 --> 00:12:45.089
8-bit and the two of you can travel the
 

00:12:45.089 --> 00:12:48.620
8-bit and the two of you can travel the
world together but interestingly the two

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:48.630
world together but interestingly the two
 

00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:51.410
world together but interestingly the two
of you can't go down many of the

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:51.420
of you can't go down many of the
 

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:54.350
of you can't go down many of the
passages that one of you could alone

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:54.360
passages that one of you could alone
 

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:56.870
passages that one of you could alone
right and this is when you start to get

00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:56.880
right and this is when you start to get
 

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.630
right and this is when you start to get
the hint that the game is maybe about

00:12:58.630 --> 00:12:58.640
the hint that the game is maybe about
 

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:01.160
the hint that the game is maybe about
something other than what it seems to be

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:01.170
something other than what it seems to be
 

00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:02.930
something other than what it seems to be
about right that it's trying to use

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:02.940
about right that it's trying to use
 

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:05.600
about right that it's trying to use
collision detection to represent

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:05.610
collision detection to represent
 

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:09.319
collision detection to represent
something else so you and your partner

00:13:09.319 --> 00:13:09.329
something else so you and your partner
 

00:13:09.329 --> 00:13:11.150
something else so you and your partner
go through the parts of the world that

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:11.160
go through the parts of the world that
 

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.180
go through the parts of the world that
you can reach as a pair and you start to

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:14.190
you can reach as a pair and you start to
 

00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:17.150
you can reach as a pair and you start to
notice that you know as you make these

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:17.160
notice that you know as you make these
 

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.160
notice that you know as you make these
movements

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:18.170
movements
 

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:21.190
movements
you are transforming right so like the

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:21.200
you are transforming right so like the
 

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.600
you are transforming right so like the
here's a shot of sort of a moment of

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:22.610
here's a shot of sort of a moment of
 

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:25.389
here's a shot of sort of a moment of
transformation and that over time as you

00:13:25.389 --> 00:13:25.399
transformation and that over time as you
 

00:13:25.399 --> 00:13:27.670
transformation and that over time as you
play the game you know your little 8-bit

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:27.680
play the game you know your little 8-bit
 

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:30.699
play the game you know your little 8-bit
sprites are becoming love you sort of

00:13:30.699 --> 00:13:30.709
sprites are becoming love you sort of
 

00:13:30.709 --> 00:13:33.100
sprites are becoming love you sort of
not only sort of further along the

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:33.110
not only sort of further along the
 

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:35.800
not only sort of further along the
screen to the right there also

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:35.810
screen to the right there also
 

00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:38.620
screen to the right there also
unmistakeably older even though they're

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:38.630
unmistakeably older even though they're
 

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:41.769
unmistakeably older even though they're
only 8 bit so you start passing through

00:13:41.769 --> 00:13:41.779
only 8 bit so you start passing through
 

00:13:41.779 --> 00:13:43.329
only 8 bit so you start passing through
these different parts of the world you

00:13:43.329 --> 00:13:43.339
these different parts of the world you
 

00:13:43.339 --> 00:13:46.000
these different parts of the world you
keep transforming you keep getting older

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:46.010
keep transforming you keep getting older
 

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:49.480
keep transforming you keep getting older
and then the sort of you know best known

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:49.490
and then the sort of you know best known
 

00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:52.240
and then the sort of you know best known
moment of the game is as you keep

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:52.250
moment of the game is as you keep
 

00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:56.019
moment of the game is as you keep
exploring the world this happens right

00:13:56.019 --> 00:13:56.029
exploring the world this happens right
 

00:13:56.029 --> 00:13:59.230
exploring the world this happens right
one of you becomes a tombstone and then

00:13:59.230 --> 00:13:59.240
one of you becomes a tombstone and then
 

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:01.030
one of you becomes a tombstone and then
you have a lot more places you can go

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:01.040
you have a lot more places you can go
 

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:05.139
you have a lot more places you can go
again but i think you know most people

00:14:05.139 --> 00:14:05.149
again but i think you know most people
 

00:14:05.149 --> 00:14:07.269
again but i think you know most people
end up playing the way that i did and

00:14:07.269 --> 00:14:07.279
end up playing the way that i did and
 

00:14:07.279 --> 00:14:09.810
end up playing the way that i did and
they just sort of go forward into this

00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:09.820
they just sort of go forward into this
 

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:14.410
they just sort of go forward into this
relatively empty checkerboard area until

00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:14.420
relatively empty checkerboard area until
 

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:16.509
relatively empty checkerboard area until
this happens and that's the end of the

00:14:16.509 --> 00:14:16.519
this happens and that's the end of the
 

00:14:16.519 --> 00:14:19.960
this happens and that's the end of the
game right so clearly you know roar is

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:19.970
game right so clearly you know roar is
 

00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:22.389
game right so clearly you know roar is
trying to use this sort of traditional

00:14:22.389 --> 00:14:22.399
trying to use this sort of traditional
 

00:14:22.399 --> 00:14:24.790
trying to use this sort of traditional
movement collision detection set of

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:24.800
movement collision detection set of
 

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:27.970
movement collision detection set of
logics to express something about life

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:27.980
logics to express something about life
 

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:32.079
logics to express something about life
and it's kind of a neat trick but I'm

00:14:32.079 --> 00:14:32.089
and it's kind of a neat trick but I'm
 

00:14:32.089 --> 00:14:33.730
and it's kind of a neat trick but I'm
pretty convinced it's not the beginning

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:33.740
pretty convinced it's not the beginning
 

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:36.069
pretty convinced it's not the beginning
of a new genre right it could be that we

00:14:36.069 --> 00:14:36.079
of a new genre right it could be that we
 

00:14:36.079 --> 00:14:38.710
of a new genre right it could be that we
would actually redefine these logics we

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:38.720
would actually redefine these logics we
 

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:40.180
would actually redefine these logics we
would say you know collision detection

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:40.190
would say you know collision detection
 

00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:42.280
would say you know collision detection
no longer means virtual objects can

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:42.290
no longer means virtual objects can
 

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:44.920
no longer means virtual objects can
touch collision detection means some

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:44.930
touch collision detection means some
 

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:46.960
touch collision detection means some
pathways in life are open to you and

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:46.970
pathways in life are open to you and
 

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:49.030
pathways in life are open to you and
others not depending on the shape of

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:49.040
others not depending on the shape of
 

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:53.139
others not depending on the shape of
your player character right but even war

00:14:53.139 --> 00:14:53.149
your player character right but even war
 

00:14:53.149 --> 00:14:55.569
your player character right but even war
has basically started moving away from

00:14:55.569 --> 00:14:55.579
has basically started moving away from
 

00:14:55.579 --> 00:14:58.180
has basically started moving away from
this right so like his new game is some

00:14:58.180 --> 00:14:58.190
this right so like his new game is some
 

00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:00.310
this right so like his new game is some
sleep as death which is also a

00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:00.320
sleep as death which is also a
 

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.259
sleep as death which is also a
storytelling game but a storytelling

00:15:02.259 --> 00:15:02.269
storytelling game but a storytelling
 

00:15:02.269 --> 00:15:04.180
storytelling game but a storytelling
game that it's only for two players and

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:04.190
game that it's only for two players and
 

00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:06.220
game that it's only for two players and
it basically is used using human

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:06.230
it basically is used using human
 

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:09.430
it basically is used using human
intelligence to try to allow a lot more

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:09.440
intelligence to try to allow a lot more
 

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:13.120
intelligence to try to allow a lot more
operations than you can get out of this

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:13.130
operations than you can get out of this
 

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:16.030
operations than you can get out of this
sort of limited palette that that he

00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:16.040
sort of limited palette that that he
 

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:19.000
sort of limited palette that that he
implements in his early games so sort of

my question and the question that I want

00:15:20.769 --> 00:15:20.779
my question and the question that I want

my question and the question that I want
to use the next 10 minutes trying to

00:15:22.509 --> 00:15:22.519
to use the next 10 minutes trying to
 

00:15:22.519 --> 00:15:25.780
to use the next 10 minutes trying to
answer is can we go further right and I

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:25.790
answer is can we go further right and I
 

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:27.490
answer is can we go further right and I
think we can go further in a couple of

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:27.500
think we can go further in a couple of
 

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.290
think we can go further in a couple of
ways

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:29.300
ways
 

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:33.880
ways
one way which is um what gets me billed

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:33.890
one way which is um what gets me billed
 

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:37.660
one way which is um what gets me billed
as an artist in a scholar is that I'd

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:37.670
as an artist in a scholar is that I'd
 

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:46.000
as an artist in a scholar is that I'd
region I create things like this so this

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:46.010
region I create things like this so this
 

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:48.819

i did with collaborators first at Brown

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:51.290
i did with collaborators first at Brown
 

00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:52.509
i did with collaborators first at Brown
University and then there was an

00:15:52.509 --> 00:15:52.519
University and then there was an
 

00:15:52.519 --> 00:15:54.430
University and then there was an
iteration at UC San Diego and there's

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:54.440
iteration at UC San Diego and there's
 

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:56.050
iteration at UC San Diego and there's
been some installation versions of it

00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:56.060
been some installation versions of it
 

00:15:56.060 --> 00:16:00.009
been some installation versions of it
and it starts with three short fictions

00:16:00.009 --> 00:16:00.019
and it starts with three short fictions
 

00:16:00.019 --> 00:16:02.079
and it starts with three short fictions
very short fictions each the size of an

00:16:02.079 --> 00:16:02.089
very short fictions each the size of an
 

00:16:02.089 --> 00:16:03.790
very short fictions each the size of an
eight-by-eight wall and when they're

00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:03.800
eight-by-eight wall and when they're
 

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:06.220
eight-by-eight wall and when they're
projected better each about memory is a

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:06.230
projected better each about memory is a
 

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:09.069
projected better each about memory is a
virtual experience and then the player

00:16:09.069 --> 00:16:09.079
virtual experience and then the player
 

00:16:09.079 --> 00:16:11.500
virtual experience and then the player
starts out by reading these texts and

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:11.510
starts out by reading these texts and
 

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:13.860
starts out by reading these texts and
then the text begin to come loose and

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:13.870
then the text begin to come loose and
 

00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:17.680
then the text begin to come loose and
you can just watch them come loose but

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:17.690
you can just watch them come loose but
 

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:19.300
you can just watch them come loose but
you can also start hitting them back

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:19.310
you can also start hitting them back
 

00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:21.730
you can also start hitting them back
with your hand and as you hit them back

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:21.740
with your hand and as you hit them back
 

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:23.769
with your hand and as you hit them back
with your hand often they go back to

00:16:23.769 --> 00:16:23.779
with your hand often they go back to
 

00:16:23.779 --> 00:16:25.720
with your hand often they go back to
where they came from but sometimes they

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:25.730
where they came from but sometimes they
 

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:27.730
where they came from but sometimes they
go back where other words used to be and

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:27.740
go back where other words used to be and
 

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:29.710
go back where other words used to be and
sometimes they break apart if you hit

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:29.720
sometimes they break apart if you hit
 

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:32.230
sometimes they break apart if you hit
them too hard or if there's not a good

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:32.240
them too hard or if there's not a good
 

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:34.150
them too hard or if there's not a good
space on the wall for them to go to and

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:34.160
space on the wall for them to go to and
 

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.880
space on the wall for them to go to and
what happens is you can play more and

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:36.890
what happens is you can play more and
 

00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:39.519
what happens is you can play more and
more actively and the more actively you

00:16:39.519 --> 00:16:39.529
more actively and the more actively you
 

00:16:39.529 --> 00:16:42.220
more actively and the more actively you
play the longer the kind of memory texts

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:42.230
play the longer the kind of memory texts
 

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:44.560
play the longer the kind of memory texts
stay in place but also the more

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:44.570
stay in place but also the more
 

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:47.550
stay in place but also the more
distorted and intermixed they become and

00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:47.560
distorted and intermixed they become and
 

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:50.949
distorted and intermixed they become and
eventually when too many words are off

00:16:50.949 --> 00:16:50.959
eventually when too many words are off
 

00:16:50.959 --> 00:16:53.920
eventually when too many words are off
the wall at once then all the rest of

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:53.930
the wall at once then all the rest of
 

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:57.100
the wall at once then all the rest of
them pull loose and collapse and that's

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:57.110
them pull loose and collapse and that's
 

00:16:57.110 --> 00:17:06.180
them pull loose and collapse and that's
the end of the experience right

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:06.190
 

00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:09.090
like this

00:17:09.090 --> 00:17:09.100
 

00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:12.000
and so what this is essentially doing is

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:12.010
and so what this is essentially doing is
 

00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:14.579
and so what this is essentially doing is
using that very familiar game mechanic

00:17:14.579 --> 00:17:14.589
using that very familiar game mechanic
 

00:17:14.589 --> 00:17:16.850
using that very familiar game mechanic
right movement and collision detection

00:17:16.850 --> 00:17:16.860
right movement and collision detection
 

00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:19.980
right movement and collision detection
but using the movement and collision

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:19.990
but using the movement and collision
 

00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:25.559
but using the movement and collision
detection to try to UM enact an activity

00:17:25.559 --> 00:17:25.569
detection to try to UM enact an activity
 

00:17:25.569 --> 00:17:31.230
detection to try to UM enact an activity
that is thematically related to um what

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:31.240
that is thematically related to um what
 

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:32.970
that is thematically related to um what
is going on in the textual material

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:32.980
is going on in the textual material
 

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:36.240
is going on in the textual material
right so we're not actually taking

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:36.250
right so we're not actually taking
 

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:39.120
right so we're not actually taking
action in the fictional world instead

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:39.130
action in the fictional world instead
 

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:40.350
action in the fictional world instead
what we're doing is we're doing some

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:40.360
what we're doing is we're doing some
 

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:43.260
what we're doing is we're doing some
other action as readers and players that

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:43.270
other action as readers and players that
 

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:45.180
other action as readers and players that
is related to the fictional world and I

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:45.190
is related to the fictional world and I
 

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:46.680
is related to the fictional world and I
think that's one way of going further

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:46.690
think that's one way of going further
 

00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:48.090
think that's one way of going further
right is that we can use these

00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:48.100
right is that we can use these
 

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:50.310
right is that we can use these
traditional gameplay mechanics even more

00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:50.320
traditional gameplay mechanics even more
 

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.350
traditional gameplay mechanics even more
radically than someone like war tries to

00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:52.360
radically than someone like war tries to
 

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:54.840
radically than someone like war tries to
use them but I think there's still this

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:54.850
use them but I think there's still this
 

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:56.100
use them but I think there's still this
question about you know what about

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:56.110
question about you know what about
 

00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:57.630
question about you know what about
playing with people right you know what

00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:57.640
playing with people right you know what
 

00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:59.310
playing with people right you know what
if we were trying to make games about

00:17:59.310 --> 00:17:59.320
if we were trying to make games about
 

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:00.930
if we were trying to make games about
people were you actually played with the

00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:00.940
people were you actually played with the
 

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:03.720
people were you actually played with the
people in the fictional world and this

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:03.730
people in the fictional world and this
 

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:05.340
people in the fictional world and this
is a course you know the elephant in the

00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:05.350
is a course you know the elephant in the
 

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:08.370
is a course you know the elephant in the
room right is will writes the sims this

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:08.380
room right is will writes the sims this
 

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:10.590
room right is will writes the sims this
is one of the best-selling games of all

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:10.600
is one of the best-selling games of all
 

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:13.320
is one of the best-selling games of all
time and it's certainly not a game about

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:13.330
time and it's certainly not a game about
 

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:15.480
time and it's certainly not a game about
collision detection right it's a game

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:15.490
collision detection right it's a game
 

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:18.120
collision detection right it's a game
about something else and I think

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:18.130
about something else and I think
 

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:20.520
about something else and I think
actually looking carefully at what it's

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:20.530
actually looking carefully at what it's
 

00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:23.310
actually looking carefully at what it's
something else is can tell us a lot

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:23.320
something else is can tell us a lot
 

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:25.680
something else is can tell us a lot
about sort of what possibility space

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:25.690
about sort of what possibility space
 

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:28.620
about sort of what possibility space
might be worth exploring as we think

00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:28.630
might be worth exploring as we think
 

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:30.960
might be worth exploring as we think
about games about people all right so

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:30.970
about games about people all right so
 

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:33.210
about games about people all right so
this is both one of the most culturally

00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:33.220
this is both one of the most culturally
 

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:35.669
this is both one of the most culturally
influential and one of the most

00:18:35.669 --> 00:18:35.679
influential and one of the most
 

00:18:35.679 --> 00:18:38.220
influential and one of the most
commercially successful games of all

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:38.230
commercially successful games of all
 

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:42.450
commercially successful games of all
time and yet unlike games like say doom

00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:42.460
time and yet unlike games like say doom
 

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:44.640
time and yet unlike games like say doom
that are also very commercially and

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:44.650
that are also very commercially and
 

00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:47.630
that are also very commercially and
culturally important there have been

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:47.640
culturally important there have been
 

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:51.690
culturally important there have been
basically no knockoffs there's been no

00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:51.700
basically no knockoffs there's been no
 

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:54.930
basically no knockoffs there's been no
sort of genre formed outside of the

00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:54.940
sort of genre formed outside of the
 

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:58.380
sort of genre formed outside of the
efforts of the sims team at Max's / EA

00:18:58.380 --> 00:18:58.390
efforts of the sims team at Max's / EA
 

00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:01.620
efforts of the sims team at Max's / EA
and why that is is also I think another

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:01.630
and why that is is also I think another
 

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:04.500
and why that is is also I think another
interesting question right okay so

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:04.510
interesting question right okay so
 

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:07.770
interesting question right okay so
what's going on in the sims for those

00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:07.780
what's going on in the sims for those
 

00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:09.720
what's going on in the sims for those
who you haven't played basically we

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:09.730
who you haven't played basically we
 

00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:12.299
who you haven't played basically we
control the home lives of simulated

00:19:12.299 --> 00:19:12.309
control the home lives of simulated
 

00:19:12.309 --> 00:19:15.630
control the home lives of simulated
people in the suburban us right so we

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:15.640
people in the suburban us right so we
 

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:16.830
people in the suburban us right so we
don't when they go to work they

00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:16.840
don't when they go to work they
 

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:19.080
don't when they go to work they
disappear when then we see them again

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:19.090
disappear when then we see them again
 

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:21.090
disappear when then we see them again
when they come home and we have to make

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:21.100
when they come home and we have to make
 

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:22.770
when they come home and we have to make
sure we get them to work on time

00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:22.780
sure we get them to work on time
 

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:25.560

it suddenly all your Sims know how to

00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:01.660
it suddenly all your Sims know how to
 

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:03.510
it suddenly all your Sims know how to
play chess the reason they know how to

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:03.520
play chess the reason they know how to
 

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:06.510
play chess the reason they know how to
play chess is because all the animations

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:06.520
play chess is because all the animations
 

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:09.690
play chess is because all the animations
and all the other behaviors in terms of

00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:09.700
and all the other behaviors in terms of
 

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:11.940
and all the other behaviors in terms of
how the simulated world is fected are

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:11.950
how the simulated world is fected are
 

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:15.480
how the simulated world is fected are
bundled up with each object right so

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:15.490
bundled up with each object right so
 

00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:17.250
bundled up with each object right so
each object is kind of a smart object

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:17.260
each object is kind of a smart object
 

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:20.430
each object is kind of a smart object
that advertises to Sims I can do these

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:20.440
that advertises to Sims I can do these
 

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:22.260
that advertises to Sims I can do these
things for you and if you take this

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:22.270
things for you and if you take this
 

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:24.030
things for you and if you take this
action this is the animation you should

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:24.040
action this is the animation you should
 

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:26.550
action this is the animation you should
use and so on so this is a shot of the

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:26.560
use and so on so this is a shot of the
 

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:28.620
use and so on so this is a shot of the
Edith editor that's actually used for

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:28.630
Edith editor that's actually used for
 

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:32.580
Edith editor that's actually used for
creating objects and here you can see

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:32.590
creating objects and here you can see
 

00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:34.170
creating objects and here you can see
something that's particularly important

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:34.180
something that's particularly important
 

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:38.010
something that's particularly important
which is how the particular actions

00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:38.020
which is how the particular actions
 

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:40.860
which is how the particular actions
being edited affects the basic needs

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:40.870
being edited affects the basic needs
 

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:43.290
being edited affects the basic needs
meters of the sims right so you can take

00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:43.300
meters of the sims right so you can take
 

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:44.970
meters of the sims right so you can take
actions that do things like increase

00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:44.980
actions that do things like increase
 

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:47.070
actions that do things like increase
skills or improve jobs or you know

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:47.080
skills or improve jobs or you know
 

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.780
skills or improve jobs or you know
change social relations with other sims

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:48.790
change social relations with other sims
 

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:51.870
change social relations with other sims
but most of the skill most of the

00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:51.880
but most of the skill most of the
 

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.240
but most of the skill most of the
actions whatever else they do and most

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:54.250
actions whatever else they do and most
 

00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:56.880
actions whatever else they do and most
of them maybe only address the needs

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:56.890
of them maybe only address the needs
 

00:20:56.890 --> 00:20:59.190
of them maybe only address the needs
meters so basically as you come to play

00:20:59.190 --> 00:20:59.200
meters so basically as you come to play
 

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:01.620
meters so basically as you come to play
the sims what you come to understand is

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:01.630
the sims what you come to understand is
 

00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:04.200
the sims what you come to understand is
that a simulated person especially sims

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:04.210
that a simulated person especially sims
 

00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:06.030
that a simulated person especially sims
1 but I would argue it's the same up

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:06.040
1 but I would argue it's the same up
 

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:08.340
1 but I would argue it's the same up
through sims 3 a simulated person is a

00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:08.350
through sims 3 a simulated person is a
 

00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:10.950
through sims 3 a simulated person is a
set of meters and basically what you're

00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:10.960
set of meters and basically what you're
 

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:13.950
set of meters and basically what you're
trying to do in life is keep these

00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:13.960
trying to do in life is keep these
 

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:17.460
trying to do in life is keep these
meters from degrading too far right if

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:17.470
meters from degrading too far right if
 

00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:20.400
meters from degrading too far right if
you get to the point where you know your

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:20.410
you get to the point where you know your
 

00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:23.220
you get to the point where you know your
bladder is about to burst or if you get

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:23.230
bladder is about to burst or if you get
 

00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:25.470
bladder is about to burst or if you get
to the point where you know you are

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:25.480
to the point where you know you are
 

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:28.140
to the point where you know you are
about to fall asleep on your feet or

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:28.150
about to fall asleep on your feet or
 

00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:30.300
about to fall asleep on your feet or
whatever you are losing of course there

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:30.310
whatever you are losing of course there
 

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:32.100
whatever you are losing of course there
is a genre of play that's just about

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:32.110
is a genre of play that's just about
 

00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:34.380
is a genre of play that's just about
torturing your sims but um we'll leave

00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:34.390
torturing your sims but um we'll leave
 

00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:35.690
torturing your sims but um we'll leave
that aside for now

00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:35.700
that aside for now
 

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:37.820
that aside for now
um I mean like you know locking them in

00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:37.830
um I mean like you know locking them in
 

00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:40.340
um I mean like you know locking them in
a room and setting it on fire or locking

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:40.350
a room and setting it on fire or locking
 

00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:42.350
a room and setting it on fire or locking
them in a room that just has no urinal

00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:42.360
them in a room that just has no urinal
 

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:46.129
them in a room that just has no urinal
or whatever um so um what are you doing

00:21:46.129 --> 00:21:46.139
or whatever um so um what are you doing
 

00:21:46.139 --> 00:21:47.750
or whatever um so um what are you doing
when you play the sims basically you're

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:47.760
when you play the sims basically you're
 

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:50.240
when you play the sims basically you're
fighting against time to meet needs and

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:50.250
fighting against time to meet needs and
 

00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:52.490
fighting against time to meet needs and
get to your job right so you know the

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:52.500
get to your job right so you know the
 

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:53.930
get to your job right so you know the
carpool is going to come in about an

00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:53.940
carpool is going to come in about an
 

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:55.759
carpool is going to come in about an
hour oh but I have a shower and I

00:21:55.759 --> 00:21:55.769
hour oh but I have a shower and I
 

00:21:55.769 --> 00:21:57.230
hour oh but I have a shower and I
haven't dressed I'm it eaten Ivan clean

00:21:57.230 --> 00:21:57.240
haven't dressed I'm it eaten Ivan clean
 

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:58.730
haven't dressed I'm it eaten Ivan clean
the house I've made the bed you know um

00:21:58.730 --> 00:21:58.740
the house I've made the bed you know um
 

00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:00.710
the house I've made the bed you know um
starting to sound really familiar

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:00.720
starting to sound really familiar
 

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:03.919
starting to sound really familiar
actually um and um there's this sort of

00:22:03.919 --> 00:22:03.929
actually um and um there's this sort of
 

00:22:03.929 --> 00:22:06.110
actually um and um there's this sort of
tension where more expensive objects

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:06.120
tension where more expensive objects
 

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:08.389
tension where more expensive objects
satisfying needs better right you know a

00:22:08.389 --> 00:22:08.399
satisfying needs better right you know a
 

00:22:08.399 --> 00:22:10.700
satisfying needs better right you know a
better refrigerator keeps food fresh or

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:10.710
better refrigerator keeps food fresh or
 

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:12.370
better refrigerator keeps food fresh or
longer and the food is more satisfying

00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:12.380
longer and the food is more satisfying
 

00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:15.139
longer and the food is more satisfying
but also requires more money to maintain

00:22:15.139 --> 00:22:15.149
but also requires more money to maintain
 

00:22:15.149 --> 00:22:17.210
but also requires more money to maintain
you're paying more bills to have the

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:17.220
you're paying more bills to have the
 

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:19.070
you're paying more bills to have the
house that will hold all these objects

00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:19.080
house that will hold all these objects
 

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:23.049
house that will hold all these objects
and so on and so basically the result

00:22:23.049 --> 00:22:23.059
and so on and so basically the result
 

00:22:23.059 --> 00:22:26.060
and so on and so basically the result
for most players certainly for me I

00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:26.070
for most players certainly for me I
 

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:28.340
for most players certainly for me I
think is it basically the sims is a game

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:28.350
think is it basically the sims is a game
 

00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:30.860
think is it basically the sims is a game
about never having enough time money or

00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:30.870
about never having enough time money or
 

00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:32.779
about never having enough time money or
space right and you're constantly

00:22:32.779 --> 00:22:32.789
space right and you're constantly
 

00:22:32.789 --> 00:22:38.299
space right and you're constantly
trading off right so what are the logics

00:22:38.299 --> 00:22:38.309
trading off right so what are the logics
 

00:22:38.309 --> 00:22:40.399
trading off right so what are the logics
of the simp the sim this is not about

00:22:40.399 --> 00:22:40.409
of the simp the sim this is not about
 

00:22:40.409 --> 00:22:42.470
of the simp the sim this is not about
movement and collision detection I would

00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:42.480
movement and collision detection I would
 

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:43.879
movement and collision detection I would
actually argue that the logics of the

00:22:43.879 --> 00:22:43.889
actually argue that the logics of the
 

00:22:43.889 --> 00:22:46.759
actually argue that the logics of the
sims are also very familiar to us right

00:22:46.759 --> 00:22:46.769
sims are also very familiar to us right
 

00:22:46.769 --> 00:22:48.740
sims are also very familiar to us right
for those of you who've played oregon

00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:48.750
for those of you who've played oregon
 

00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:50.769
for those of you who've played oregon
trail or those of you who've played

00:22:50.769 --> 00:22:50.779
trail or those of you who've played
 

00:22:50.779 --> 00:22:53.269
trail or those of you who've played
civilization or those of you who played

00:22:53.269 --> 00:22:53.279
civilization or those of you who played
 

00:22:53.279 --> 00:22:56.049
civilization or those of you who played
will rights earlier game SimCity right

00:22:56.049 --> 00:22:56.059
will rights earlier game SimCity right
 

00:22:56.059 --> 00:22:58.730
will rights earlier game SimCity right
these are the logics basically of

00:22:58.730 --> 00:22:58.740
these are the logics basically of
 

00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:01.190
these are the logics basically of
resource allocation and random events

00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:01.200
resource allocation and random events
 

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:03.279
resource allocation and random events
right so their sources sinks

00:23:03.279 --> 00:23:03.289
right so their sources sinks
 

00:23:03.289 --> 00:23:05.899
right so their sources sinks
transformations right I can choose to

00:23:05.899 --> 00:23:05.909
transformations right I can choose to
 

00:23:05.909 --> 00:23:09.799
transformations right I can choose to
turn my sims time into relief for my

00:23:09.799 --> 00:23:09.809
turn my sims time into relief for my
 

00:23:09.809 --> 00:23:11.779
turn my sims time into relief for my
sims bladder but it is not that

00:23:11.779 --> 00:23:11.789
sims bladder but it is not that
 

00:23:11.789 --> 00:23:14.930
sims bladder but it is not that
different from choosing to turn part of

00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:14.940
different from choosing to turn part of
 

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:17.840
different from choosing to turn part of
my population to harvesting grain in

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:17.850
my population to harvesting grain in
 

00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:20.690
my population to harvesting grain in
civilization right um that these are

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:20.700
civilization right um that these are
 

00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:23.470
civilization right um that these are
very familiar logics these are not

00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:23.480
very familiar logics these are not
 

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:26.720
very familiar logics these are not
invented for the sims and actually that

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:26.730
invented for the sims and actually that
 

00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:29.799
invented for the sims and actually that
is probably why we don't see a genre

00:23:29.799 --> 00:23:29.809
is probably why we don't see a genre
 

00:23:29.809 --> 00:23:32.269
is probably why we don't see a genre
emerging around the sims I would argue

00:23:32.269 --> 00:23:32.279
emerging around the sims I would argue
 

00:23:32.279 --> 00:23:34.009
emerging around the sims I would argue
that basically it's like Jason Mora's

00:23:34.009 --> 00:23:34.019
that basically it's like Jason Mora's
 

00:23:34.019 --> 00:23:36.830
that basically it's like Jason Mora's
passage it's kind of a one-off it kind

00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:36.840
passage it's kind of a one-off it kind
 

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:38.600
passage it's kind of a one-off it kind
of says hey you know you could use those

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:38.610
of says hey you know you could use those
 

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:39.950
of says hey you know you could use those
logics that were designed for something

00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:39.960
logics that were designed for something
 

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:41.120
logics that were designed for something
else and you could actually use them to

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:41.130
else and you could actually use them to
 

00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:43.549
else and you could actually use them to
represent human life but those logics

00:23:43.549 --> 00:23:43.559
represent human life but those logics
 

00:23:43.559 --> 00:23:45.889
represent human life but those logics
were never designed to represent human

00:23:45.889 --> 00:23:45.899
were never designed to represent human
 

00:23:45.899 --> 00:23:47.659
were never designed to represent human
life and there's kind of one trick to

00:23:47.659 --> 00:23:47.669
life and there's kind of one trick to
 

00:23:47.669 --> 00:23:47.919
life and there's kind of one trick to
how

00:23:47.919 --> 00:23:47.929
how
 

00:23:47.929 --> 00:23:51.129
how
do it and i would say that also probably

00:23:51.129 --> 00:23:51.139
do it and i would say that also probably
 

00:23:51.139 --> 00:23:53.320
do it and i would say that also probably
tells us why at least for me a

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:53.330
tells us why at least for me a
 

00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:56.220
tells us why at least for me a
particular story is the best sim story

00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:56.230
particular story is the best sim story
 

00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:59.560
particular story is the best sim story
so this is like there's a story of this

00:23:59.560 --> 00:23:59.570
so this is like there's a story of this
 

00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:02.379
so this is like there's a story of this
gnome who used to have a very sort of

to call for help so he went into the
 

00:24:12.169 --> 00:24:13.930
to call for help so he went into the

and now the brother is also a lawn

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:20.450
and now the brother is also a lawn
 

00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:24.519
and now the brother is also a lawn
ornament like the gnome but that's I'm

00:24:24.519 --> 00:24:24.529

not the best same story right that's

00:24:26.169 --> 00:24:26.179
not the best same story right that's
 

00:24:26.179 --> 00:24:27.399
not the best same story right that's
just sort of the kind of story you

00:24:27.399 --> 00:24:27.409
just sort of the kind of story you
 

00:24:27.409 --> 00:24:29.200
just sort of the kind of story you
usually see out of the sims which is

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:29.210
usually see out of the sims which is
 

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:32.889
usually see out of the sims which is
basically the audience for the game

00:24:32.889 --> 00:24:32.899
basically the audience for the game

sims play themselves they can go into

00:25:13.509 --> 00:25:13.519
sims play themselves they can go into
 

00:25:13.519 --> 00:25:16.119

kind of autonomous know mode according

00:25:16.119 --> 00:25:16.129
kind of autonomous know mode according
 

00:25:16.129 --> 00:25:18.310
kind of autonomous know mode according
to the logic of the game right so the

00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:18.320
to the logic of the game right so the
 

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:21.009
to the logic of the game right so the
story involves a lot of like a 0 them

00:25:21.009 --> 00:25:21.019
story involves a lot of like a 0 them
 

00:25:21.019 --> 00:25:23.350

00:25:37.299 --> 00:25:37.309
not for financial security but to send
 

00:25:37.309 --> 00:25:41.980
not for financial security but to send
off to charity and and basically it's a

00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:41.990
off to charity and and basically it's a
 

00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:44.739
off to charity and and basically it's a
story about resources right when the

00:25:44.739 --> 00:25:44.749
story about resources right when the
 

00:25:44.749 --> 00:25:46.450
story about resources right when the
sameness tells its own story when it

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:46.460
sameness tells its own story when it
 

00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:47.950
sameness tells its own story when it
tells a satisfying story it's a story

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:47.960
tells a satisfying story it's a story
 

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:50.560
tells a satisfying story it's a story
about resources about not having enough

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:50.570
about resources about not having enough
 

00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:53.049
about resources about not having enough
resources because the internal logics of

00:25:53.049 --> 00:25:53.059
resources because the internal logics of
 

00:25:53.059 --> 00:25:55.389
resources because the internal logics of
the sims are entirely organized around

00:25:55.389 --> 00:25:55.399
the sims are entirely organized around
 

00:25:55.399 --> 00:25:58.659
the sims are entirely organized around
resources so what if we wanted to invent

00:25:58.659 --> 00:25:58.669
resources so what if we wanted to invent
 

00:25:58.669 --> 00:26:00.460
resources so what if we wanted to invent
new logics and this is kind of the home

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:00.470
new logics and this is kind of the home
 

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:01.539
new logics and this is kind of the home
stretch here although I think

00:26:01.539 --> 00:26:01.549
stretch here although I think
 

00:26:01.549 --> 00:26:04.840
stretch here although I think
starting to be overtime right can I take

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:04.850
starting to be overtime right can I take
 

00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:08.529
starting to be overtime right can I take
a couple extra minutes yeah okay so some

00:26:08.529 --> 00:26:08.539
a couple extra minutes yeah okay so some
 

00:26:08.539 --> 00:26:09.999
a couple extra minutes yeah okay so some

you interact and there are a lot of
 

00:26:26.389 --> 00:26:28.690
you interact and there are a lot of
structures kind of built for facade so

00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:28.700
structures kind of built for facade so
 

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:30.669
structures kind of built for facade so
there's this drama manager the kind of

00:26:30.669 --> 00:26:30.679
there's this drama manager the kind of
 

00:26:30.679 --> 00:26:32.529
there's this drama manager the kind of
tries to sequence the action to have

this new Aristotelian arc there are

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:34.970
this new Aristotelian arc there are
 

00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:38.859
this new Aristotelian arc there are
these sequencing beats that cause the

00:26:38.859 --> 00:26:38.869
these sequencing beats that cause the
 

00:26:38.869 --> 00:26:41.889
these sequencing beats that cause the

the characters to sort of do little
 

00:26:41.899 --> 00:26:44.019
the characters to sort of do little
interactive bits with you the inter

actor and then recover when you bring up
other things and so on but there's a

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:48.230
other things and so on but there's a
 

00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:50.109
other things and so on but there's a
design lesson that actually came out of

00:26:50.109 --> 00:26:50.119
design lesson that actually came out of
 

00:26:50.119 --> 00:26:51.669
design lesson that actually came out of
this which is that a powerful way of

00:26:51.669 --> 00:26:51.679
this which is that a powerful way of
 

00:26:51.679 --> 00:26:54.220
this which is that a powerful way of
making games about people is to create

00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:54.230
making games about people is to create
 

00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:56.349
making games about people is to create
what Matthias and stern called social

00:26:56.349 --> 00:26:56.359
what Matthias and stern called social
 

00:26:56.359 --> 00:26:58.720
what Matthias and stern called social
games so for example in the beginning of

00:26:58.720 --> 00:26:58.730
games so for example in the beginning of
 

00:26:58.730 --> 00:27:00.639
games so for example in the beginning of
the facade they're trying to make you

00:27:00.639 --> 00:27:00.649
the facade they're trying to make you
 

00:27:00.649 --> 00:27:03.070
the facade they're trying to make you
play an affinity game which is kind of a

00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:03.080
play an affinity game which is kind of a
 

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:05.409
play an affinity game which is kind of a
zero-sum trying to force you to take

00:27:05.409 --> 00:27:05.419
zero-sum trying to force you to take
 

00:27:05.419 --> 00:27:07.599
zero-sum trying to force you to take
sides between them later on they're

00:27:07.599 --> 00:27:07.609
sides between them later on they're
 

00:27:07.609 --> 00:27:09.399
sides between them later on they're
playing this therapy game where you're

00:27:09.399 --> 00:27:09.409
playing this therapy game where you're
 

00:27:09.409 --> 00:27:10.749
playing this therapy game where you're
supposed to be trying to help them come

00:27:10.749 --> 00:27:10.759
supposed to be trying to help them come
 

00:27:10.759 --> 00:27:12.549
supposed to be trying to help them come
to sort of greater self revelation about

00:27:12.549 --> 00:27:12.559
to sort of greater self revelation about
 

00:27:12.559 --> 00:27:15.759
to sort of greater self revelation about
themselves and this idea of social games

00:27:15.759 --> 00:27:15.769
themselves and this idea of social games
 

00:27:15.769 --> 00:27:18.580
themselves and this idea of social games
is something that was not explicitly

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:18.590
is something that was not explicitly
 

00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:21.099
is something that was not explicitly
algorithmically invent represented in

00:27:21.099 --> 00:27:21.109
algorithmically invent represented in
 

00:27:21.109 --> 00:27:23.320
algorithmically invent represented in
facade it's almost as though you had a

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:23.330
facade it's almost as though you had a
 

00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:25.989
facade it's almost as though you had a
platforming game but you pasted on the

00:27:25.989 --> 00:27:25.999
platforming game but you pasted on the
 

00:27:25.999 --> 00:27:27.639
platforming game but you pasted on the
collision detection code into every

00:27:27.639 --> 00:27:27.649
collision detection code into every
 

00:27:27.649 --> 00:27:29.049
collision detection code into every
single platform that they could run into

00:27:29.049 --> 00:27:29.059
single platform that they could run into
 

00:27:29.059 --> 00:27:31.330
single platform that they could run into
right it's kind of hand authored all the

00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:31.340
right it's kind of hand authored all the
 

00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:33.789
right it's kind of hand authored all the
way through is the way that these social

00:27:33.789 --> 00:27:33.799
way through is the way that these social
 

00:27:33.799 --> 00:27:37.599
way through is the way that these social
games were represented so um question is

00:27:37.599 --> 00:27:37.609
games were represented so um question is
 

00:27:37.609 --> 00:27:39.759
games were represented so um question is
from how would you move this to an

00:27:39.759 --> 00:27:39.769
from how would you move this to an
 

00:27:39.769 --> 00:27:42.099
from how would you move this to an
explicit algorithmic representation so

00:27:42.099 --> 00:27:42.109
explicit algorithmic representation so
 

00:27:42.109 --> 00:27:44.649
explicit algorithmic representation so
one approach might be the sims 3 right

00:27:44.649 --> 00:27:44.659
one approach might be the sims 3 right
 

00:27:44.659 --> 00:27:46.930
one approach might be the sims 3 right
it has these social situations so when a

00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:46.940
it has these social situations so when a
 

00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:48.909
it has these social situations so when a
houseguest is over everyone behaves

00:27:48.909 --> 00:27:48.919
houseguest is over everyone behaves
 

00:27:48.919 --> 00:27:51.310
houseguest is over everyone behaves
differently then you you don't do you do

00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:51.320
differently then you you don't do you do
 

00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:52.299
differently then you you don't do you do
things that are different than you would

00:27:52.299 --> 00:27:52.309
things that are different than you would
 

00:27:52.309 --> 00:27:53.950
things that are different than you would
do in your own house you do different

00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:53.960
do in your own house you do different
 

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:55.210
do in your own house you do different
things than you would do with members of

00:27:55.210 --> 00:27:55.220
things than you would do with members of
 

00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:57.220
things than you would do with members of
your own household but the actions are

00:27:57.220 --> 00:27:57.230
your own household but the actions are
 

00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:59.169
your own household but the actions are
really atomic there's no connections and

00:27:59.169 --> 00:27:59.179
really atomic there's no connections and
 

00:27:59.179 --> 00:28:01.749
really atomic there's no connections and
series of actions there's no history

00:28:01.749 --> 00:28:01.759
series of actions there's no history
 

00:28:01.759 --> 00:28:03.460
series of actions there's no history
that goes on right you know no one ever

00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:03.470
that goes on right you know no one ever
 

00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:05.349
that goes on right you know no one ever
says that time when you came over to my

00:28:05.349 --> 00:28:05.359
says that time when you came over to my
 

00:28:05.359 --> 00:28:07.570
says that time when you came over to my
house and ate the lasagna that was mine

00:28:07.570 --> 00:28:07.580
house and ate the lasagna that was mine
 

00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:10.210
house and ate the lasagna that was mine
right because the history only exists as

00:28:10.210 --> 00:28:10.220
right because the history only exists as
 

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:13.330
right because the history only exists as
meters and you can't refer to a history

00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:13.340
meters and you can't refer to a history
 

00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:14.799
meters and you can't refer to a history
in any sort of meaningful

00:28:14.799 --> 00:28:14.809
in any sort of meaningful
 

00:28:14.809 --> 00:28:17.619
in any sort of meaningful
that's only exists as meters so the

00:28:17.619 --> 00:28:17.629
that's only exists as meters so the
 

00:28:17.629 --> 00:28:19.539
that's only exists as meters so the
question is can we combine widely

00:28:19.539 --> 00:28:19.549
question is can we combine widely
 

00:28:19.549 --> 00:28:21.999
question is can we combine widely
varying play with a fully realized human

00:28:21.999 --> 00:28:22.009
varying play with a fully realized human
 

00:28:22.009 --> 00:28:25.149
varying play with a fully realized human
situation and especially can we do this

00:28:25.149 --> 00:28:25.159
situation and especially can we do this
 

00:28:25.159 --> 00:28:27.580
situation and especially can we do this
both immediately moment by moment and

00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:27.590
both immediately moment by moment and
 

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:30.190
both immediately moment by moment and
over time so actually we're doing an

00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:30.200
over time so actually we're doing an
 

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:32.110
over time so actually we're doing an
experiment right now in an unannounced

00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:32.120
experiment right now in an unannounced
 

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:34.779
experiment right now in an unannounced
game that we're calling the prom which

00:28:34.779 --> 00:28:34.789
game that we're calling the prom which
 

00:28:34.789 --> 00:28:39.580
game that we're calling the prom which
has emo people sort of AV Club people

00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:39.590
has emo people sort of AV Club people
 

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:42.639
has emo people sort of AV Club people
and goth people who are at a high school

00:28:42.639 --> 00:28:42.649
and goth people who are at a high school
 

00:28:42.649 --> 00:28:45.909
and goth people who are at a high school
together and you can do things like view

00:28:45.909 --> 00:28:45.919
together and you can do things like view
 

00:28:45.919 --> 00:28:48.009
together and you can do things like view
the state of their social network right

00:28:48.009 --> 00:28:48.019
the state of their social network right
 

00:28:48.019 --> 00:28:52.810
the state of their social network right
so in this case of Edward and Karen like

00:28:52.810 --> 00:28:52.820
so in this case of Edward and Karen like
 

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:54.310
so in this case of Edward and Karen like
your level objective and the sort of

00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:54.320
your level objective and the sort of
 

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:55.690
your level objective and the sort of
social puzzle would be to get them to

00:28:55.690 --> 00:28:55.700
social puzzle would be to get them to
 

00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:57.789
social puzzle would be to get them to
date but that turns out to be impossible

00:28:57.789 --> 00:28:57.799
date but that turns out to be impossible
 

00:28:57.799 --> 00:29:00.609
date but that turns out to be impossible
because Robert who's good friends with

00:29:00.609 --> 00:29:00.619
because Robert who's good friends with
 

00:29:00.619 --> 00:29:02.799
because Robert who's good friends with
Edward hates Karen and there are a lot

00:29:02.799 --> 00:29:02.809
Edward hates Karen and there are a lot
 

00:29:02.809 --> 00:29:04.060
Edward hates Karen and there are a lot
of things that you could do to kind of

00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:04.070
of things that you could do to kind of
 

00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:06.249
of things that you could do to kind of
try to change the social situation to

00:29:06.249 --> 00:29:06.259
try to change the social situation to
 

00:29:06.259 --> 00:29:08.499
try to change the social situation to
make it possible right so you could make

00:29:08.499 --> 00:29:08.509
make it possible right so you could make
 

00:29:08.509 --> 00:29:10.690
make it possible right so you could make
it so that you know these two just like

00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:10.700
it so that you know these two just like
 

00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:12.399
it so that you know these two just like
each other better or you could make it

00:29:12.399 --> 00:29:12.409
each other better or you could make it
 

00:29:12.409 --> 00:29:14.889
each other better or you could make it
so these two like each other less and so

00:29:14.889 --> 00:29:14.899
so these two like each other less and so
 

00:29:14.899 --> 00:29:18.580
so these two like each other less and so
on and you know in the sort of prototype

00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:18.590
on and you know in the sort of prototype
 

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:20.379
on and you know in the sort of prototype
version that you're seeing images of

00:29:20.379 --> 00:29:20.389
version that you're seeing images of
 

00:29:20.389 --> 00:29:23.409
version that you're seeing images of
here we don't do any sort of like facial

00:29:23.409 --> 00:29:23.419
here we don't do any sort of like facial
 

00:29:23.419 --> 00:29:24.970
here we don't do any sort of like facial
animation but maybe that's appropriate

00:29:24.970 --> 00:29:24.980
animation but maybe that's appropriate
 

00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:26.919
animation but maybe that's appropriate
because like if your email enough you

00:29:26.919 --> 00:29:26.929
because like if your email enough you
 

00:29:26.929 --> 00:29:29.320
because like if your email enough you
should be sad even when you're admitting

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:29.330
should be sad even when you're admitting
 

00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:32.350
should be sad even when you're admitting
that you like someone a lot so this is

00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:32.360
that you like someone a lot so this is
 

00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:34.119
that you like someone a lot so this is
again another collaboration with a big

00:29:34.119 --> 00:29:34.129
again another collaboration with a big
 

00:29:34.129 --> 00:29:37.810
again another collaboration with a big
group of people and so in essence the

00:29:37.810 --> 00:29:37.820
group of people and so in essence the
 

00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:39.009
group of people and so in essence the
structure of this game is that the

00:29:39.009 --> 00:29:39.019
structure of this game is that the
 

00:29:39.019 --> 00:29:40.930
structure of this game is that the
characters play exaggerated social games

00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:40.940
characters play exaggerated social games
 

00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:43.570
characters play exaggerated social games
the design of these games is actually

00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:43.580
the design of these games is actually
 

00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:45.759
the design of these games is actually
inspired both by sort of dramaturgical

00:29:45.759 --> 00:29:45.769
inspired both by sort of dramaturgical
 

00:29:45.769 --> 00:29:48.340
inspired both by sort of dramaturgical
analysis which is a you know an old vein

00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:48.350
analysis which is a you know an old vein
 

00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:50.830
analysis which is a you know an old vein
of social science work and fiction serve

00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:50.840
of social science work and fiction serve
 

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:53.220
of social science work and fiction serve
you know humanistic and writing centric

00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:53.230
you know humanistic and writing centric
 

00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:56.680
you know humanistic and writing centric
evaluation of social games and what

00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:56.690
evaluation of social games and what
 

00:29:56.690 --> 00:29:58.720
evaluation of social games and what
these games exist to do is change social

00:29:58.720 --> 00:29:58.730
these games exist to do is change social
 

00:29:58.730 --> 00:30:00.609
these games exist to do is change social
state and then they chained together

00:30:00.609 --> 00:30:00.619
state and then they chained together
 

00:30:00.619 --> 00:30:02.680
state and then they chained together
right so somebody asked someone out well

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:02.690
right so somebody asked someone out well
 

00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:04.299
right so somebody asked someone out well
maybe that results in flirting and

00:30:04.299 --> 00:30:04.309
maybe that results in flirting and
 

00:30:04.309 --> 00:30:06.879
maybe that results in flirting and
flirting can chain to other things or

00:30:06.879 --> 00:30:06.889
flirting can chain to other things or
 

00:30:06.889 --> 00:30:08.289
flirting can chain to other things or
maybe results of a compliment that can

00:30:08.289 --> 00:30:08.299
maybe results of a compliment that can
 

00:30:08.299 --> 00:30:10.629
maybe results of a compliment that can
change other things and then these

00:30:10.629 --> 00:30:10.639
change other things and then these
 

00:30:10.639 --> 00:30:13.539
change other things and then these
particular parts of the social games get

00:30:13.539 --> 00:30:13.549
particular parts of the social games get
 

00:30:13.549 --> 00:30:15.519
particular parts of the social games get
filled out with things from the social

00:30:15.519 --> 00:30:15.529
filled out with things from the social
 

00:30:15.529 --> 00:30:18.190
filled out with things from the social
facts database so in this case we could

00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:18.200
facts database so in this case we could
 

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:22.080
facts database so in this case we could
say that Edward no they get reads

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:22.090
say that Edward no they get reads
 

00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:24.129
say that Edward no they get reads
Dostoevsky and in the world at this high

00:30:24.129 --> 00:30:24.139
Dostoevsky and in the world at this high
 

00:30:24.139 --> 00:30:26.049
Dostoevsky and in the world at this high
school that is lame right so that's part

00:30:26.049 --> 00:30:26.059
school that is lame right so that's part
 

00:30:26.059 --> 00:30:27.950
school that is lame right so that's part
of the social facts database

00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:27.960
of the social facts database
 

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:30.770
of the social facts database
and then games also create history and

00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:30.780
and then games also create history and
 

00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:32.690
and then games also create history and
reveal history so part of what happens

00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:32.700
reveal history so part of what happens
 

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:34.550
reveal history so part of what happens
as you play this game is that not only

00:30:34.550 --> 00:30:34.560
as you play this game is that not only
 

00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:37.340
as you play this game is that not only
are things recorded about how the social

00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:37.350
are things recorded about how the social
 

00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:38.840
are things recorded about how the social
games play out that can then be

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:38.850
games play out that can then be
 

00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:41.900
games play out that can then be
connected to future social games but

00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:41.910
connected to future social games but
 

00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:44.780
connected to future social games but
also you reveal things about the

00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:44.790
also you reveal things about the
 

00:30:44.790 --> 00:30:46.820
also you reveal things about the
characters who they are how they became

00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:46.830
characters who they are how they became
 

00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:49.910
characters who they are how they became
in the situation's therein as you play

00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:49.920
in the situation's therein as you play
 

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:53.480
in the situation's therein as you play
because the game starts with the with

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:53.490
because the game starts with the with
 

00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:55.220
because the game starts with the with
this database already pretty well

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:55.230
this database already pretty well
 

00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:57.860
this database already pretty well
populated so there are many possible

00:30:57.860 --> 00:30:57.870
populated so there are many possible
 

00:30:57.870 --> 00:30:59.750
populated so there are many possible
paths through social configurations to a

00:30:59.750 --> 00:30:59.760
paths through social configurations to a
 

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:01.940
paths through social configurations to a
given goal and yet the social

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:01.950
given goal and yet the social
 

00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:03.170
given goal and yet the social
interactions are kind of fully and

00:31:03.170 --> 00:31:03.180
interactions are kind of fully and
 

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:06.140
interactions are kind of fully and
concretely realized so and this is just

00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:06.150
concretely realized so and this is just
 

00:31:06.150 --> 00:31:07.430
concretely realized so and this is just
an experiment right this is just the

00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:07.440
an experiment right this is just the
 

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:09.140
an experiment right this is just the
sort of thing that we do in our group is

00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:09.150
sort of thing that we do in our group is
 

00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:10.820
sort of thing that we do in our group is
we we try to imagine how you could

00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:10.830
we we try to imagine how you could
 

00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:13.160
we we try to imagine how you could
create a new game and then maybe

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:13.170
create a new game and then maybe
 

00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:15.500
create a new game and then maybe
potentially a new genre so the

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:15.510
potentially a new genre so the
 

00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:17.240
potentially a new genre so the
conclusion of my talk is that I think we

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:17.250
conclusion of my talk is that I think we
 

00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:18.710
conclusion of my talk is that I think we
can make games that are really about

00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:18.720
can make games that are really about
 

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:20.690
can make games that are really about
people and we can really try to

00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:20.700
people and we can really try to
 

00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:22.880
people and we can really try to
understand games that are about people

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:22.890
understand games that are about people
 

00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:25.520
understand games that are about people
but it will require computer scientists

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:25.530
but it will require computer scientists
 

00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:27.620
but it will require computer scientists
artists and humanists working together

00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:27.630
artists and humanists working together
 

00:31:27.630 --> 00:31:30.590
artists and humanists working together
thank you
