As we wrap up, I want to welcome
you one more time to CS6460,

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.560
Educational Technology.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.390
We'll be running most of the class
through announcements and

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:09.660
through interactions on the forum, so
I'd recommend you check those often.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.780
And in fact, I'd really recommend
you check in at least once per day,

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.350
if only for a few minutes.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.880
Part of the goal for this course is to
develop a community of collaborators,

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.900
and communities really
thrive on frequent activity.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.370
You'll definitely see us there and
we hope to see you there as well.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.260
Beyond that, we're really excited
to see what you come up with, and

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.120
we're looking forward
to getting started.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.640
I hope you are, too.
