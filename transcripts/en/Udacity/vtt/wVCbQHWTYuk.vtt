00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
For this problem, we're going to be talking about cathode ray tubes.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
And it may or may not be a name that means something to you depending on how old you are.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Cathode ray tubes used to be main way we got televisions to work

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
before we had LED, LCD, and plasma televisions.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And let's investigate how exactly these tubes work.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So on one end of the tube we have an electron here, and we give it some really large

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
initial velocity V₀ such that it shoots across this tube towards this green screen over here.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And when this electron hits the screen over here,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
it temporary causes it to light up producing a dot on the screen.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Now you can imagine if we were able to draw lots of these dots on the screen

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
we could use it to draw images like this one here.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Well in order for us to be able to make dots on other parts of the screen,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
we have to bend the path of the electron so it doesn't just go on a straight line.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And how can we bend the path of an electron? Well one easy way is with an electric field.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And we saw on the previous two questions that a great way to produce a nice

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
constant magnetic field is to have two parallel plates  like these two.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
When this negatively charged electron moves into this electric field,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
it'll get pulled towards the positive plate directing it to this part of the screen.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And you could imagine if we wanted the electron to go down here,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
we just switch the charges so the negative charges were up here

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and the positive charges were down here.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
This means we can control what part of the screen the electron hits and therefore

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
lights up just by changing the strength and direction of this electric field here.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
For this problem you're going to tell me how strong I should make this

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
electric field such that this electron gets bent a distance away from the center

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
from its straight line path of Δy.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
You should assume that the electron is in the magnetic field

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
for a total distance of 0.5 m and we want the deviation away

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
from the center of Δy to be equal to 0.1 m.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.000
We'll also assume that the electron enters the field with an initial velocity of 1x10⁷ m/s.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
You will also need the charge and mass of the electron, which I have provided here.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Now a few quick notes. You'll notice that the speed here is really large

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and the super student among you might notice that it's actually getting close

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
to being the speed of light.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
If you heard anything about the theory of relativity, you might know that as we get

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
close to the speed of light strange things start to happen.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
We won't worry about any of that in this problem now.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Just assume that everything behaves as we're used to.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Also note that even though I've drawn my field line so the arrows are pointing down

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
the electron is going to bend up because it has a negative charge

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and we always draw the field lines in the direction a positive charge will move.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
All right--so you can put your answer for the strength of the electric field

00:02:22.000 --> 99:59:59.000
right here and put it in units of N/C--all right, good luck.
