&gt;&gt; Narrator: From the Library
of Congress, in Washington, DC.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.330
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Mr.
Robinson you are here at Ira

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.300
and George Gershwin's
-- wonderful team.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.280
And this was George
Gershwin's favorite piano.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.130
&gt;&gt; Smokey Robinson: Well -- hang on
one second [background laughter].

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.790
Get the keys -- I'll just rub
this all over me [laughs].

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.420
&gt;&gt; I think you've got it, but
you've got something going

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.720
[background laughter].

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.020
You've got something going.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.610
But what does it feel like to get
the Gershwin Award, and you've had

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:37.960
that in your life, didn't you?

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.270
&gt;&gt; Well, this is kind of
like unbelievable to me.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.080
It's something that I
never dare to even dream

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.380
about or even think about.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.160
You know, to be -- for me to even
be mentioned in the same breath

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.870
with the Gershwin's [laughs] as
a songwriter, is just incredible.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.970
I just -- I can't believe it.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.660
It's just -- because I
heard the Gershwin's --

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.460
their music was some of the
first music I ever heard

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.750
as a baby, growing up in Detroit.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.070
I had two older sisters and my mom.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.140
And between my two
sisters and my mom,

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.930
they played all kinds
of music every day.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.280
We had everything from gut
bucket blues, to Gospel, to Jazz,

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.350
to Classical being played
at our house all the time.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.760
And the Gershwin's music was
prevalent in that because --

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.610
see, the Gershwin's wrote
songs when the song was king.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.970
And I say that because
back in those days, when --

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.180
say the Gershwin's,
they wrote a hit song.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.750
All the artists of that day or
that time recorded that song.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.420
It's not like nowadays, you know,
an artist comes out with a song,

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.990
and the artist is like
the focal point nowadays.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.040
So-and-so comes out with a
record, and they record it,

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.260
and people love it and so
on, and maybe sometimes

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.510
down the line someone else will
pick up that song and record it.

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.550
But back in the Gershwin days,
when they wrote a hit song,

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.960
everyone recorded it immediately.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.040
So that song was out
by 10 or 12 artists

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.280
at the same time, because
it was a song.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.930
The song was king, and so
everybody wanted to hear that song,

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.500
so people just sang that song.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.850
And it was a wonderful time,
and their music was some

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.370
of the first music I
ever heard growing up.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.170
The first voice I ever
remember hearing

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.760
in my entire life was Sarah
Vaughan, and she was singing,

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.060
"Our Love is Here to Stay."

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.570
That's one of my favorite
songs every.

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.190
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: "Our
Love is Here to Stay."

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.490
&gt;&gt; Smokey Robinson: "Our
Love is Here to Stay" is one

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:24.790
of my favorite songs ever.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.350
But yeah, so I grew up in a home
where there was always music.

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.650
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Always music.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.320
Now did other people play music?

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.640
I mean in terms of
piano or instruments?

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.510
&gt;&gt; Smokey Robinson: Momma -- we had
an old upright piano in the house,

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.370
and my mom played the piano.

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.210
And she sang in church.

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:42.510
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Ah.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.320
&gt;&gt; Smokey Robinson: You know,
nobody ever sang professionally

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.680
or played professionally
like that, you know?

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.300
But we had an old upright piano in
the house where I would go and bang

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.630
on it, you know [laughs]?

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.790
But that was the closest
we got to that.

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.830
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: When did you
start to realize that hey,

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.930
this is something I just
have to do; want to do.

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.690
This is -- music is my life.

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.770
&gt;&gt; Smokey Robinson: I really don't
know when I started to realize it,

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.160
but I can tell you honestly that
from the time I was probably five

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.440
or six years old, I always
wanted to be a singer.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.480
I mean that was my -- in fact,
up until I was like five or six,

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.010
it was my second ambitious.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.780
Because my first one
was to be a cowboy.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.080
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Oh [laughs].

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.380
&gt;&gt; Smokey Robinson: Yeah.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.760
So -- and then -- but I
always wanted to be a singer.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.130
And I watched all of the variety
shows; anything that had to do

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.960
with music or what have you,
and it was always there.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.150
It was just my impossible dream.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.730
It was something that I never
thought could ever happen.

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.180
From where I grew up, you know,
that's not going to happen.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.060
I mean, you know, I'm
growing up in the hood.

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.340
I live in the joint in the
hood, so that can't happen.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.890
That was my thoughts about that.

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.130 position:56%
Because -- but I just loved to sing.

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.810
And so I really always wanted this,

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.190
and it's such an incredible
blessing,

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.340 position:56%
as far as I'm concerned, to have it.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.240
To have been able -- to have
been given this, you know?

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.640
And to live it when it
was my impossible dream.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.940
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Mm-hmm.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:17.200
And you had a partner -- a partner
in music and crime; Mr. Gordy.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.500
&gt;&gt; Smokey Robinson: Yeah.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.800
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: We
just looked at one

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.120
of your first copywrites
songs, "I cry"?

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.420
&gt;&gt; Smokey Robinson: Yeah.

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:29.210
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And it's both of
you, like Ira and George Gershwin.

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.680
Now your partnership -- now you've
been buddies for quite a while.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.750 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Smokey Robinson: Yeah, we've been
buddies since -- [laughs] and -- no.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.650
I -- when you were
pinning this pin on me --

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:41.950
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Yes.

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.250
&gt;&gt; Smokey Robinson: I said
to him he should be proud

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.420
of himself because I'm his pupil.

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.600
You know? I'm one of
his many pupils.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.290
And were it not for
him being who he is,

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.180
I probably wouldn't
be sitting here today,

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.820
getting ready to get the Gershwin
Award and all that, you know?

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.170
When I met Barry, you know, I've
always tried to write songs.

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:02.600
I've tried to write songs since
I was probably six years old.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.900
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Hm.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.860
&gt;&gt; Smokey Robinson: And I had
a loose-leaf notebook full

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.000
of what I thought were
songs, you know?

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.570 position:56%
When I met him -- there was at least
100 of them in there, you know?

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:12.460
And he was already a
professional songwriter,

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.320
because when I buy records,
even today, when I buy music --

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.650
and I always have done this --

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.930
I always like to see
who wrote this music?

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:21.440
You know? I'm not looking
to see who's playing it

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.380
or who's singing it, or I want
to know who wrote this music?

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.400
Who created this song that
these people are singing

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.330
or playing right here; right now.

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:34.000
So as a kid growing up, my number
one singing idol was Jackie Wilson.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.390
And Jackie Wilson was dynamic.

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:42.740
And I have all his records.

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.390
And all his hit songs are
written by Barry Gordy, okay?

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:46.690
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Really?

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:47.990
&gt;&gt; Smokey Robinson: Oh yeah.

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:49.290
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: I'm sorry.

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:50.590
I remember "Lonely Teardrops."

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:51.890
&gt;&gt; So -- that was Barry
Gordy [laughs].

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:57.900
So when I -- my group, they were
called The Matadors at the time.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.870
And we had an opportunity
to go audition

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.610
for Jackie Wilson's managers.

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:07.420
They were in Detroit and they
were talent scouting, you know?

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:13.480
And so we went to the audition,
and we had a girl singer with us --

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.630
my first wife, Claudette,
was singing with us.

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:19.970
So we went to audition for them,

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.790
and we sang five songs
that I had written.

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:25.700
Which we thought was going
to be get all the things --

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.000
"They got their own material;

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.400
we will definitely
sign them, so -- " No.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.490
That didn't -- [laughs]
did not happen.

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.140
Because we had a girl in the group,
and I sang high and all that.

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.830
So they told us that we were
too much like The Platters.

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.550
The Platters were the number one
group in the world at that time,

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:41.610
with a girl in the group -- Zolo
[phonetic] was in the group,

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:44.340
and Tony sang high notes, so they
said, "You're too much like them;

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:45.640
so you'll never make it."

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.150
And so on and so on;
so they rejected us.

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:49.960
At the same time, there's a young
man sitting over in the corner.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.330
And he was looking at us.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:52.910
And I thought he was
waiting to audition.

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:55.860
Because at this time I was probably
about 16; I thought he was about 17

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:57.160
or 18, because that
was how he looked.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.550
And he was sitting over
in the corner, I think,

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:00.860
"Well he's going to
audition after us."

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:06.040
And so after they rejected us and
we walked out, and we were very,

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.120
very dejected and walking
down the hall and sad,

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.650
and he came up behind us.

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:11.450
He said, "Hey man, wait a minute.

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:13.340
So I turned around and
said, "Yeah, how you doing?"

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.960
He said, "Where'd you
get those songs from?"

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:19.450
And I'm wondering in my
mind, "What's it to him?"

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:20.960 position:56%
Why -- so where'd I get songs from?"

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.260
[Laughs] you know?

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.340
But I'm going to be nice, because
he's interested, and what if --

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.090
so I said, "I wrote them."

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:28.400
Oh gosh [cell phone
ringing] [laughs].

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.700
Sorry.

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:31.070
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: [Laughs]
now see, everyone wants

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:32.850
to know what's on your ringtone?

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:34.220
&gt;&gt; Smokey Robinson:
Sorry about that.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.230
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Smokey
Robinson's ringtone [laughs].

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:37.530
&gt;&gt; Smokey Robinson: But --

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:38.830
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: What
song is on there?

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:42.140
&gt;&gt; Smokey Robinson: But anyway,
he said to me, he said, "You know,

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:44.060 position:56%
I liked a couple of your songs man."

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:47.320
So I said, "Yeah", I said, "Oh
great man; thank you very much."

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.240
He said, "Yeah," he
said, "I'm Barry Gordy."

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.960
And I couldn't speak for
two minutes [laughs].

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.380
This guy right here is Barry Gordy?

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:57.090
The guy I'm listening to his music
all this time and I'm hearing it.

00:07:57.090 --> 00:07:59.430
And he's -- looked
like he's about my age.

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:02.050
That -- this is Barry Gordy who
wrote all these songs that I got?

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:04.120
You know? I couldn't believe it.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:07.500
So he said that he liked a couple
of my songs, and he wanted --

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:09.620
he made the mistake of asking me
if I had anymore, so [laughs] --

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:11.180
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: You
had that notebook.

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:12.480
&gt;&gt; Smokey Robinson: So
I had that notebook.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.850
So we go in this little room, and
he said, "Hey I like the sound

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:16.490
of your voice man, you got
-- sing some of your songs."

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:19.510
So I was like, "I'm going to
sing 20 songs up here that day."

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:22.670
He never once said to
me, "Hey man, I'm tired."

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:24.370
Or, "I've got to go."

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:25.670
Or, "That's enough."

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:27.560
Or, "Okay man, I'll see you later."

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:30.060
He never said that, you know?

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:32.420
He just sat there and listened
to all of them, you know?

00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:34.630
And every time he would listen
to one, he would critique it.

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:36.780
"No man, you should have
so-and-so; you should've done this.

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:38.080
You should've said so-and-so."

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:41.920
But -- because I had -- man
I could always rhyme stuff,

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:44.420
but I would have four or
five songs in one song,

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:47.210
because my first verse had
absolutely nothing to do

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:48.510
with my second verse
[background laughter].

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:50.360
And my second verse
didn't have nothing to do

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.250
with the bridge and all that.

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:54.040
So he finally said to me,
[laughs] he said, "Man,

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.540
you've got to look
at a song like this.

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:57.320
It's a short book.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.480
It's a short story;
it's a short movie."

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.020
With a beginning and the middle
and the ending tying together,

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:04.630
and give people something
to work with to make --

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:07.330
even if you don't finish it,
you've given them enough material

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:08.910
so that they can work with it.

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:11.290
He started to mentor
me on my songwriting.

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:19.970
So if he hadn't been
there [choked up].

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:26.260
I don't -- I don't
know where I'd be.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.840
I don't -- it's unbelievable to me.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.010
If he hadn't been that
kind of guy, you know?

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:33.810
That would take that time.

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:41.390
But he was, so here I am
at the Gershwin piano.

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:43.440
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And
his favorite piano.

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:44.740
&gt;&gt; Smokey Robinson: Yeah.

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:46.040
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And his favorite.

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:47.340
&gt;&gt; Smokey Robinson: Yeah, the
Gershwin piano; I'm sitting here.

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:48.640
This is --

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:49.940
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And
he's with you today too.

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:51.240
&gt;&gt; Smokey Robinson: Yeah, he is.

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.390
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: He's
with you today.

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:55.690
&gt;&gt; Smokey Robinson: Yeah.

00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:58.220
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Now one of my
favorite songs, and I'm using this

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:01.510
as an opportunity, is
"Tracks of My Tears."

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:02.810
[Laughs].

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:04.110
&gt;&gt; Smokey Robinson:
All right [laughs].

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:06.350
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And it's in
the registry for all time.

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:07.650
&gt;&gt; Smokey Robinson: Yeah
it is; it's beautiful.

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:08.950
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: As
one of the favorites.

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:11.870 position:56%
And that one touched so many people.

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:13.170
&gt;&gt; Smokey Robinson:
Yeah that's beautiful.

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:16.160
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And did
that -- is it one of yours?

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:17.460
&gt;&gt; Smokey Robinson:
I -- that's the --

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:22.680
the origin for that song was like
the origin of so many songs for me.

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:28.370
My most prolific, incredible,
fantastic writing partner

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:33.040
that I ever had was a guy named
Marv Tarplin; he was my guitarist.

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.480
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: T-U-R-P-I-N.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:35.780
&gt;&gt; Smokey Robinson: Yeah.

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:40.860
Marv was a -- he would put his
music on tape and give it to me.

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:42.900
"Hey man, see what you
can come up with this."

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:45.130
So "Tracks of my Tears"
was one of those.

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:46.730
He put that music on
tape; I had that music

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:51.390 position:56%
for three months before I could come
up with any kind of idea for it.

00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:54.970 position:56%
But he -- I loved his guitar playing
and his guitar riffs so he had it.

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:56.420
So I finally came up with the --

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:59.250
with the first three
lines of the chorus.

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:00.550
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Mm-hmm.

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:01.850
&gt;&gt; Smokey Robinson: "Take
a good look at my face.

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:03.150
You'll see my smile
looks out of place.

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:05.430
If you look closer, it's easy
to trace -- that you're gone.

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:06.730
No, that's not it [background
laughter].

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:09.510
It's easy to trace that
I'm looking for you?

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:10.880
No, that's not it.

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:13.180
It's easy to trace that I'm really
sad, because -- no that's not --

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:15.310
I went through a hundred of those.

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:18.400
One morning I was in
Europe, and I was shaving.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.180
And I was just looking in
the mirror, and I was looking

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:24.000
at my face, I said, "Wow, what
if somebody had cried so much

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.690
until if you looked closely at
their face, you could see tracks

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:29.720
that their tears had made?"

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:32.270
And I said, "Okay, that's it.

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:33.570
That's that song."

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:36.530
But the origin of it was Marv
Tarplin because he gave me

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:39.690 position:56%
that music that inspired that lyric.

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:41.370
So he was -- he was awesome.

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:45.920
He's passed on now, but
he was -- he was awesome.

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:47.630
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: So I
have to ask you this.

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:49.530
We heard the ringtone
[background laughter].

00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:52.830
I didn't recognize
what it was [laughs].

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:55.650
But what kind of music, and
who are you listening to?

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:57.180
And you can be honest.

00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:58.480
&gt;&gt; Smokey Robinson:
I'm going to be honest.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:01.710
I'm going to be honest, because
I'm not ashamed of it, you know.

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:05.520
If you could see my iPod, or even
my programming of the stations

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:08.400
in my car, or wherever
I listen to music.

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.130
I might be listening to Bach.

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:14.740
I might be listening
to Chopin or Beethoven.

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:21.570
I might be listening to Frank
Sinatra, or Ella Fitzgerald.

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:31.250
I might be listening to Bruno
Mars or Mariah Carey or Beyonce.

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:34.870
I might be listening
to Nelly or 50 Cent.

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:38.030
Or -- you know, it's just according
to what I want to hear that day.

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:42.040
And you know, I listen
to all musics.

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:43.480
And I'm not one of
these people who says,

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:44.780
"Well you know the kids nowadays,

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:46.390
they're making all this
terrible music and that."

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:49.410
There's some kids making some
great music out there today.

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:52.260
Making some great music, you know?

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.610
But they don't get the credit
because we live in this world

00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:56.470
where the negative
gets the attention.

00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:59.340
So all the negative music is
what people are talking about.

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:01.170
"Well, this is something
that -- " No.

00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:04.090
The kids are making some
great music still, you know?

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:07.020
But the negative is getting
the attention, so the positive

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:10.540
of what they're doing [laughs]
is falling behind the wayside

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:12.970
of the negatives that
they're talking about.

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:14.320
But it's the same thing
with the whole world.

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:17.100
I mean we always -- we are
bombarded negatively all day long

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:18.870
on the news -- everything is --

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:22.150
well, let's report this
negativity, you know?

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:24.960
I think every town, every
city, every state should have

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:28.010
at least three or four
stations that it's mandatory

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:30.730
that they give nothing
but good news, you know?

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:32.030
But, yeah -- [background
laughter] --

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:33.330
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Well --

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:34.630
&gt;&gt; Smokey Robinson: But that's
what's happening with the music.

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:36.480
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Well I
think this is good news.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.300
And I can't thank you enough.

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:40.350
And I know the Library
of Congress thanks you,

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:44.300
and so many people are going to
see you at the Gershwin piano,

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:45.740
and you deserve to be here.

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:49.040
&gt;&gt; Smokey Robinson:
Thank you, very much.

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.980
&gt;&gt; Narrator: This has
been a presentation

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:52.930
of the Library of Congress.
