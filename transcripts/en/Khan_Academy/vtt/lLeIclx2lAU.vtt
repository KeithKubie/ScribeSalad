00:00:00.201 --> 00:00:02.318
- [Instructor] In our
study of world history

00:00:02.318 --> 00:00:04.921
we have looked at many different empires

00:00:04.921 --> 00:00:06.892
and several of them are depicted

00:00:06.892 --> 00:00:08.886
on this map right over here.

00:00:08.886 --> 00:00:11.649
We spent a lot of time on the Roman Empire

00:00:11.649 --> 00:00:14.217
and in the highlighted yellow
you see the Roman Empire

00:00:14.217 --> 00:00:15.942
at roughly its maximum extent.

00:00:15.942 --> 00:00:19.263
And on this timeline you
see the Roman Kingdom

00:00:19.263 --> 00:00:22.855
and then the Roman Republic
and then the Roman Empire

00:00:22.855 --> 00:00:24.276
which ends in the fifth century

00:00:24.276 --> 00:00:26.564
although the Eastern Roman
Empire, the Byzantine Empire,

00:00:26.564 --> 00:00:29.803
continues on for roughly
another thousand years.

00:00:29.803 --> 00:00:31.001
Now we also have depicted here

00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:32.793
a significant Persian Empire.

00:00:32.793 --> 00:00:34.888
You have the Parthian Empire

00:00:34.888 --> 00:00:38.416
and they were preceded
by the Seleucid Empire

00:00:38.416 --> 00:00:41.325
and they were succeeded
by the Sasanian Empire

00:00:41.325 --> 00:00:42.585
but I have the Parthians depicted here

00:00:42.585 --> 00:00:44.909
on the timeline and on the map.

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:46.745
I also show Han China,

00:00:46.745 --> 00:00:47.578
both the Eastern and Western Han Dynasties

00:00:47.578 --> 00:00:50.732
both the Eastern and Western Han Dynasties

00:00:50.732 --> 00:00:53.671
you can see on this timeline as well.

00:00:53.671 --> 00:00:57.177
And in India, I show the
Maurya Dynasty on the timeline

00:00:57.177 --> 00:00:59.194
I don't depict it here on the map

00:00:59.194 --> 00:01:02.133
but on the map I show the Kushan Empire

00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:04.862
and I also show it on the timeline.

00:01:04.862 --> 00:01:07.753
Now the reason why I
wanna depict these empires

00:01:07.753 --> 00:01:10.487
at this specific time in the world

00:01:10.487 --> 00:01:12.160
is to highlight the fact that

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.690
they weren't operating
in complete isolation.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:15.773
In fact, as we get to the
second and first century BCE,

00:01:15.773 --> 00:01:19.904
In fact, as we get to the
second and first century BCE,

00:01:19.904 --> 00:01:22.237
especially as we get into the Common Era,

00:01:22.237 --> 00:01:23.872
we start seeing a significant amount

00:01:23.872 --> 00:01:27.296
of trade and interaction
between these empires.

00:01:27.296 --> 00:01:28.404
Not to say that there wasn't trade

00:01:28.404 --> 00:01:30.350
and interaction before that time

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:31.932
but it started to get accelerated

00:01:31.932 --> 00:01:33.712
and to a large degree it got accelerated

00:01:33.712 --> 00:01:37.006
because you had these continuous empires

00:01:37.006 --> 00:01:38.437
that at least within their borders

00:01:38.437 --> 00:01:40.555
were able to provide
some level of stability

00:01:40.555 --> 00:01:43.185
for someone to travel across roads

00:01:43.185 --> 00:01:45.561
or travel across borders.

00:01:45.561 --> 00:01:48.584
And so you start to see the emergence

00:01:48.584 --> 00:01:50.752
of these trading networks.

00:01:50.752 --> 00:01:55.126
In red you see trading
roads or paths in red

00:01:55.126 --> 00:01:58.364
and in blue you see those paths by sea.

00:01:58.364 --> 00:01:59.866
And this isn't even comprehensive.

00:01:59.866 --> 00:02:00.942
And even what I show on the empires

00:02:00.942 --> 00:02:02.547
are many other smaller kingdoms

00:02:02.547 --> 00:02:04.489
that also existed in the world

00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:06.174
that I just don't have depicted here.

00:02:06.174 --> 00:02:10.203
But what this contiguous
block of empires allowed

00:02:10.203 --> 00:02:12.614
is for the trade of goods and ideas

00:02:12.614 --> 00:02:13.896
and sometimes collectively

00:02:13.896 --> 00:02:16.428
the routes that were used for this trade

00:02:16.428 --> 00:02:18.501
is referred to as the Silk
Road or the Silk Roads

00:02:18.501 --> 00:02:21.077
is referred to as the Silk
Road or the Silk Roads

00:02:21.077 --> 00:02:23.564
or really you could say, the Silk Routes.

00:02:23.564 --> 00:02:25.681
And so it's a collective number of paths

00:02:25.681 --> 00:02:27.717
that people used to trade things.

00:02:27.717 --> 00:02:29.219
Now why call it silk?

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:30.315
Now why call it silk?

00:02:30.315 --> 00:02:32.731
Well it all boils down to silk

00:02:32.731 --> 00:02:36.721
being a major commodity of
trade at this time period.

00:02:36.721 --> 00:02:38.765
So if you wanna think
about the different things

00:02:38.765 --> 00:02:39.823
that were traded around the world

00:02:39.823 --> 00:02:42.123
that were traded around the world

00:02:42.123 --> 00:02:44.527
this is just a sample of it.

00:02:44.527 --> 00:02:45.360
Silk which comes from
cocoons of these silk worms

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.615
Silk which comes from
cocoons of these silk worms

00:02:48.615 --> 00:02:50.820
that eat mulberry leaves

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.631
was considered a sign of wealth.

00:02:53.631 --> 00:02:55.972
It was considered the finest cloth

00:02:55.972 --> 00:02:59.749
and China had a monopoly
on how to make silk

00:02:59.749 --> 00:03:02.081
for many hundreds of years

00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:05.886
even after the period that we
were talking about right here.

00:03:05.886 --> 00:03:07.802
So you can imagine around the world

00:03:07.802 --> 00:03:09.683
people were interested in getting access

00:03:09.683 --> 00:03:11.015
to that Chinese silk.

00:03:11.015 --> 00:03:13.255
But silk wasn't the only
thing that was being traded.

00:03:13.255 --> 00:03:14.389
In fact, in order to trade

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:17.524
you need to give something in
exchange for even that silk.

00:03:17.524 --> 00:03:20.882
One of the Chinese motivations
for trading with others

00:03:20.882 --> 00:03:23.002
is having access to horses.

00:03:23.002 --> 00:03:23.984
is having access to horses.

00:03:23.984 --> 00:03:26.561
Horses were valuable not
just for transporting goods

00:03:26.561 --> 00:03:27.796
but also in wars

00:03:27.796 --> 00:03:31.106
especially fighting some
of their northern enemies

00:03:31.106 --> 00:03:33.268
who had access to horses.

00:03:33.268 --> 00:03:36.517
They also were able to
get gold from Europe,

00:03:36.517 --> 00:03:39.262
be able to get cotton from India.

00:03:39.262 --> 00:03:42.074
In Europe you also had
other manufactured goods.

00:03:42.074 --> 00:03:45.490
So you had this fairly
vast trading enterprise

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:49.945
emerge between these
different parts of the world.

00:03:49.945 --> 00:03:53.071
And to be clear, some of
the things that were traded

00:03:53.071 --> 00:03:55.648
allowed or facilitated the trade itself.

00:03:55.648 --> 00:03:58.035
I mentioned horses were a
source of transportation

00:03:58.035 --> 00:03:59.477
but camels in particular

00:03:59.477 --> 00:04:02.265
were very powerful
sources of transportation

00:04:02.265 --> 00:04:04.492
especially across Central Asia

00:04:04.492 --> 00:04:07.351
and as you get into the
Middle East and Africa

00:04:07.351 --> 00:04:09.605
because you have these
large swaths of desert.

00:04:09.605 --> 00:04:11.473
Camels can not only carry a lot

00:04:11.473 --> 00:04:12.739
but they had a lot of stamina

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:15.781
and they did not have to
stop for water as frequently.

00:04:15.781 --> 00:04:16.681
In a lot of world history,

00:04:16.681 --> 00:04:19.634
we focus on the large non-nomadic empires

00:04:19.634 --> 00:04:22.132
like the Roman Empire and Han China

00:04:22.132 --> 00:04:24.628
but as trade became more important

00:04:24.628 --> 00:04:27.610
especially as you go through Central Asia,

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.837
you could imagine that many of the people

00:04:29.837 --> 00:04:31.551
who were very good at trading

00:04:31.551 --> 00:04:32.817
who were good at moving things

00:04:32.817 --> 00:04:34.518
were people who were good
at moving themselves,

00:04:34.518 --> 00:04:38.540
in particular, the nomadic
people in Central Asia.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.361
Many of their cities
along these trade routes

00:04:41.361 --> 00:04:43.693
became more and more wealthy

00:04:43.693 --> 00:04:44.526
became more and more wealthy

00:04:44.526 --> 00:04:46.748
and more and more powerful.

00:04:46.748 --> 00:04:50.577
Now as I mentioned, goods
were not the only thing

00:04:50.577 --> 00:04:54.340
that were transported along these routes.

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.620
One of the not so good things
was the spread of disease.

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.500
So in the historical record,

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.296
we have two major plagues in
Rome during the Roman Empire

00:05:04.296 --> 00:05:06.952
we have two major plagues in
Rome during the Roman Empire

00:05:06.952 --> 00:05:09.278
and we believe these
plagues were small pox

00:05:09.278 --> 00:05:12.260
although some people believe
it might have been measles.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.849
And it is believed that
it came from traders.

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:17.556
It came from Asia, from the Middle East,

00:05:17.556 --> 00:05:19.469
and these were significant plagues.

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:21.980
And the reason why we think
that it was due to trade

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:23.995
is that there's some evidence in Han China

00:05:23.995 --> 00:05:25.385
during this first plague

00:05:25.385 --> 00:05:28.295
of similar symptoms of a similar plague.

00:05:28.295 --> 00:05:30.139
But it really affected Rome.

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:31.879
In these plagues, it's estimated that

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:34.885
as much as 10% of the
population might have died.

00:05:34.885 --> 00:05:35.951
In certain cities

00:05:35.951 --> 00:05:38.900
it might have been 25,
30% of the population.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.276
Some historians even
point to these plagues

00:05:41.276 --> 00:05:44.233
as destabilizing the Roman Empire.

00:05:44.233 --> 00:05:46.954
And this is a theme that you'll
see often in world history

00:05:46.954 --> 00:05:48.592
where if you have a population

00:05:48.592 --> 00:05:51.302
that doesn't have exposure
to something, say small pox,

00:05:51.302 --> 00:05:52.154
and all of a sudden

00:05:52.154 --> 00:05:54.786
they encounter a population
that does have exposure

00:05:54.786 --> 00:05:58.023
well that small pox might wreak havoc.

00:05:58.023 --> 00:05:59.859
But it wasn't just disease,

00:05:59.859 --> 00:06:03.141
you also have the spread of ideas

00:06:03.141 --> 00:06:05.695
and technology and religion.

00:06:05.695 --> 00:06:08.162
And the two religions that perhaps

00:06:08.162 --> 00:06:10.839
benefited the most from the early trade

00:06:10.839 --> 00:06:13.916
along the Silk Route or the Silk Roads

00:06:13.916 --> 00:06:16.591
were Christianity and Buddhism.

00:06:16.591 --> 00:06:19.526
And Buddhism, in particular
was very appealing

00:06:19.526 --> 00:06:22.135
to many of these Silk Road merchants.

00:06:22.135 --> 00:06:23.745
The Kushan Empire, in particular

00:06:23.745 --> 00:06:26.411
started to significantly spread Buddhism.

00:06:26.411 --> 00:06:29.044
In previous videos we talk about
Ashoka sending missionaries

00:06:29.044 --> 00:06:33.335
but the Kushan Empire help
spread Buddhism into China

00:06:33.335 --> 00:06:35.168
and into the Far East.

00:06:36.025 --> 00:06:37.561
So what we talked about in this video

00:06:37.561 --> 00:06:39.763
was the very beginning of the Silk Road.

00:06:39.763 --> 00:06:42.137
As we get into the first few centuries BCE

00:06:42.137 --> 00:06:44.831
or the first few centuries
of the Common Era.

00:06:44.831 --> 00:06:47.610
But as we'll see, the
Silk Road will continue on

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:51.777
for many hundreds or really
over a thousand years.
