00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:09.070
An edible survival guide, and a hummingbird
feeder... for your face.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:14.349
Vsauce! Kevin here. This is Mind Blow.

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:19.520
Touche is an advanced touch interaction system
that can make anything advanced touchscreen.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.220
The swept-frequency capacitive sensing technique
not only detects a touch event, but recognizes

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.660
complex hand and body configurations. Like
the difference between a thumb and a two finger

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.309
pinch. Or a grasp and covering your ears.
This could lead to smart phones being controlled

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:42.960
simply by gesturing, or your living room electronics
changing depending on how you sit on the couch.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.579
Or maybe you'd like to talk into your hand
with Glove One. A wearable mobile-communication

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:54.170
device that sacrifices a hand to become a
phone. The prototype is more of an artistic

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.710
project than a legitimate innovation, but
I wanted to share it anyway because it reminded

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.210
me of inspector gadget.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.500
Shiri is a robot buttox that expresses various
emotions with the movement of artificial muscles.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.790
These include tension, twitch and protrusion, and 
the internal base is a urethan skeleton with

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.830
the movement controlled by a system dubbed
the "Gluteus Maximus Actuator," which responds

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.430
depending on how it's touched.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.320
So yeah.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.660
The Cryoscope is a touch feedback device that
lets you feel the temperature anywhere in

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:36.100
the world. This tactile weather display is
made up of a metal contact surface, a thermoelectric

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.000
element, heat sink, and cooling fan. So you
can be in Florida and feel the temperature

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.850
in the South Pole. The WiFi and Cryonet are
still currently in development- find the link below.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.270
"Hey, is it cool if I put a sandwich in your
toaster?" "Sure, just use the Toastabag and

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.470
you're good to go." "Thanks, just one question:
where did you get a toaster that fits a whole

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.750
sandwich?" "...uhhh I gotta go."

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.360
SoundWave is a gesture recognition system
using the doppler effect. Basically, it leverages

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.250
the speaker and microphone already in things
like laptops by generating an inaudible tone,

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.860
and then monitoring the frequency shift when
reflecting moving objects, like your hand.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.610
Fueling free WiFi in the park could be your
dog's poop. As incentive to clean up after

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.140
dogs in Mexico City's parks, the Terra Poo
WiFi measures the poop and provides

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.040
longer free WiFi depending on the amount of
poop.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:36.800
Dubai has plans to build an underwater hotel.
Half of the Water Discus hotel will be submerged,

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.370
providing guests with a view 10 meters below
the water. And the disc automatically surfaces

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.990
in the event of an emergency.

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:48.380
For the first time ever, this is footage of
the world's rarest Gorillas. The Cross River

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:54.810
Gorilla is the most endangered of the African
Apes, with only an estimated 250 or so in

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.590
the wild.

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.900
Finally, Festo's robotic band can compose
and perform music, and each instrument has

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:09.900
only one string.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.240
I'm gonna leave you with a hand-cranked cocktail
shaking machine and as always - thanks for

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:27.240
watching.
