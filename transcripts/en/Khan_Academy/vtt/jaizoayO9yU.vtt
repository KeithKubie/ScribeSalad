00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:01.589
- [Voiceover] Hey Becca!

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:02.582
- [Voiceover] Hey Kim!

00:00:02.582 --> 00:00:04.793
- [Voiceover] Alright, so
we're talking about how people

00:00:04.793 --> 00:00:07.422
got to the Americas today.

00:00:07.422 --> 00:00:10.582
So when did people first
arrive in North America?

00:00:10.582 --> 00:00:12.237
Was Columbus the first one?

00:00:12.237 --> 00:00:14.665
- [Voiceover] So, no he was not.

00:00:14.665 --> 00:00:16.320
You know, back in the day people believed

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.811
that actually pre-Columbus
no one was here,

00:00:19.811 --> 00:00:22.127
but in this video I'm
not going to be talking

00:00:22.127 --> 00:00:23.607
about if, right?

00:00:23.607 --> 00:00:25.818
There definitely were people here,

00:00:25.818 --> 00:00:28.914
but I'll be talking about
how people got here,

00:00:28.914 --> 00:00:30.914
when, and who they were.

00:00:34.861 --> 00:00:37.089
And so these are the
questions that historians

00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:39.736
and archaeologists are
still debating today.

00:00:39.736 --> 00:00:41.651
So Kim who are archaeologists?

00:00:41.651 --> 00:00:42.679
(chuckling)

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:45.238
- [Voiceover] Well
archaeologists are scholars

00:00:45.238 --> 00:00:47.071
who work in the lands.

00:00:48.599 --> 00:00:53.370
They will dig in the places
where people lived in the past,

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.983
find remains of earlier civilizations,

00:00:56.983 --> 00:01:00.718
and use that evidence to build a picture

00:01:00.718 --> 00:01:03.059
of what life was like in a place

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.436
before there was a written record.

00:01:05.436 --> 00:01:07.073
- [Voiceover] So a lot of
the history we'll talk about

00:01:07.073 --> 00:01:09.267
in this video has to do
with different evidence

00:01:09.267 --> 00:01:12.392
and competing evidence that
archaeologists have found

00:01:12.392 --> 00:01:15.666
in the lands that we now
call the United States.

00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:17.755
So as I mentioned, we're
not arguing if there

00:01:17.755 --> 00:01:20.062
were people here because
there definitely were.

00:01:20.062 --> 00:01:23.815
There were even big cities
and towns and people living

00:01:23.815 --> 00:01:26.531
together in societies that look a lot like

00:01:26.531 --> 00:01:29.056
what the colonists were
trying to make as well.

00:01:29.056 --> 00:01:31.136
- [Voiceover] Yeah I
think people often have

00:01:31.136 --> 00:01:35.690
the misconception that Native
Americans were primarily

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.857
hunter-gatherers who pretty
much lived in very small bands

00:01:41.244 --> 00:01:45.379
that didn't leave much
of a record of buildings

00:01:45.379 --> 00:01:48.566
or living sites, they were more nomadic.

00:01:48.566 --> 00:01:53.476
But people were all over
North America and they had

00:01:53.476 --> 00:01:57.054
societies that were very
different from each other,

00:01:57.054 --> 00:02:00.458
some of which were very
complex politically,

00:02:00.458 --> 00:02:03.514
and some of which were quite large cities.

00:02:03.514 --> 00:02:06.404
This city here is Cahokia, which is--

00:02:06.404 --> 00:02:07.941
- [Voiceover] That's a
fun thing to say, Cahokia.

00:02:07.941 --> 00:02:08.822
- [Voiceover] (giggles) Yeah, I know.

00:02:08.822 --> 00:02:10.488
I love the name Cahokia.

00:02:10.488 --> 00:02:12.803
Close to modern-day St. Louis,

00:02:12.803 --> 00:02:16.301
this was the largest city in the Americas.

00:02:16.301 --> 00:02:20.468
About 40,000 to maybe 60,000
people lived in this city.

00:02:23.284 --> 00:02:25.356
It's gonna be the largest
city in the Americas

00:02:25.356 --> 00:02:29.523
until the 1780s when
Philadelphia has more people.

00:02:30.728 --> 00:02:32.930
- [Voiceover] Wow, that
is just really remarkable.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.890
So 40,000 people here in Cahokia,

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.207
and there were still
historical records that said

00:02:39.207 --> 00:02:40.931
that there was no one here?

00:02:40.931 --> 00:02:43.290
- [Voiceover] (giggling) Well
you know, history is something

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.616
that is highly influenced
by the kind of narratives

00:02:46.616 --> 00:02:48.740
that historians wanna tell.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.893
We know that humans as a
species today originated

00:02:52.893 --> 00:02:56.201
somewhere in Africa and then
spread throughout Europe

00:02:56.201 --> 00:02:59.527
and Asia to other land masses.

00:02:59.527 --> 00:03:03.662
So how did they get to the
North American continent?

00:03:03.662 --> 00:03:05.499
- [Voiceover] So we don't know for sure,

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:08.163
but archaeologists and historians
have pretty much agreed

00:03:08.163 --> 00:03:11.767
that the Native Americans
came through the Bering Strait

00:03:11.767 --> 00:03:13.240
which is as you can see right here.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.431
This was like this big ice
sheet during the Ice Age

00:03:16.431 --> 00:03:20.090
that connected Asia and
North America through Alaska.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.107
So the Native Americans came from Asia,

00:03:24.107 --> 00:03:25.613
they were Asian really,

00:03:25.613 --> 00:03:29.121
and they walked across the Bering Strait

00:03:29.121 --> 00:03:31.655
and down into North America.

00:03:31.655 --> 00:03:34.824
- [Voiceover] What is
now water at that time

00:03:34.824 --> 00:03:36.966
was covered with ice.

00:03:36.966 --> 00:03:40.474
So I'm guessing they're
following herds of animals

00:03:40.474 --> 00:03:42.059
that they might like to eat.

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:43.121
- [Voiceover] Yes, exactly,

00:03:43.121 --> 00:03:45.759
and these were called the Paleo-Indians,

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:47.630
so they were the first Indians.

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.130
Paleo-Indians really means ancient people.

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:56.180
So these were the ancient
people and they were, again,

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.548
following different animals.

00:03:58.548 --> 00:04:02.056
So historians estimate that
the Paleo-Indians came down

00:04:02.056 --> 00:04:06.223
through the Bering Strait
about 13,000 years ago, so--

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:08.333
- [Voiceover] Wow!

00:04:08.333 --> 00:04:10.327
- [Voiceover] It was a long time ago.

00:04:10.327 --> 00:04:13.444
But now different archaeological
evidence may point

00:04:13.444 --> 00:04:18.189
to the Paleo-Indians coming
over much earlier than that,

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:21.697
actually more like 16,000 years ago.

00:04:21.697 --> 00:04:23.734
- [Voiceover] Yeah, I mean 3,000 years is

00:04:23.734 --> 00:04:25.606
a significant difference.

00:04:25.606 --> 00:04:29.454
I mean think about 3,000
years earlier than today,

00:04:29.454 --> 00:04:31.883
we'd be talking 1000 B.C.E.

00:04:31.883 --> 00:04:34.608
- [Voiceover] So today
archaeologists and historians

00:04:34.608 --> 00:04:37.585
kind of argue about when exactly it was,

00:04:37.585 --> 00:04:40.546
and lots of different evidence and fossils

00:04:40.546 --> 00:04:44.141
and archaeological digs
are coming up with evidence

00:04:44.141 --> 00:04:48.189
that points us more
toward 16,000 than 13,000.

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:52.022
So it was actually in
1925 when archaeologists

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.816
found the first Clovis point.

00:04:55.816 --> 00:04:59.324
So they're called Clovis
points because in 1925

00:04:59.324 --> 00:05:02.898
archaeologists found
these kinds of arrowheads.

00:05:02.898 --> 00:05:04.870
They're very small,
probably nothing more than

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.047
like two centimeters,

00:05:07.047 --> 00:05:10.337
but they found them in Clovis, New Mexico,

00:05:10.337 --> 00:05:12.587
so over here in New Mexico,

00:05:14.647 --> 00:05:17.823
and estimated that they
were about 13,000 old.

00:05:17.823 --> 00:05:19.625
So that's kind of our old hypothesis,

00:05:19.625 --> 00:05:22.176
that humans were hunting
with these Clovis points

00:05:22.176 --> 00:05:25.562
13,000 years ago,
probably buffalo or bison,

00:05:25.562 --> 00:05:29.075
or any other kind of larger
animal that they would need

00:05:29.075 --> 00:05:32.806
to carve out of stone
these arrowheads to shoot,

00:05:32.806 --> 00:05:35.017
with a bow and arrow most likely,

00:05:35.017 --> 00:05:36.802
these larger animals to eat.

00:05:36.802 --> 00:05:38.691
- [Voiceover] So this is
some of the first evidence

00:05:38.691 --> 00:05:41.677
that leads archaeologists
to an interpretation

00:05:41.677 --> 00:05:45.804
of when human habitation first
occurred in North America?

00:05:45.804 --> 00:05:49.251
- [Voiceover] Exactly and this
was kind of the overwhelming

00:05:49.251 --> 00:05:51.210
consensus for really long time.

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.083
All throughout the 1900s
people are digging up

00:05:54.083 --> 00:05:56.939
different artifacts all
across North America,

00:05:56.939 --> 00:06:00.717
finding more Clovis points
and kind of all agree

00:06:00.717 --> 00:06:03.634
it was about 13,000 years
ago that they came, again,

00:06:03.634 --> 00:06:06.384
down through here and all around,

00:06:07.377 --> 00:06:10.146
and that's why we were
finding these Clovis points.

00:06:10.146 --> 00:06:14.313
But then in 1997, not too
long ago at all, actually,

00:06:15.596 --> 00:06:19.391
so a Vanderbilt archaeologist,
his name is Tom Dillehay,

00:06:19.391 --> 00:06:23.558
found evidence of humanity in
Chile, all the way down here.

00:06:24.894 --> 00:06:27.376
So it seemed like the humans were living

00:06:27.376 --> 00:06:30.013
about 14,000 years ago.

00:06:30.013 --> 00:06:32.469
So it would have only
taken them a thousand years

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:36.291
to get all the way from up here down here.

00:06:36.291 --> 00:06:39.782
So now there's kind of
two competing hypotheses.

00:06:39.782 --> 00:06:42.933
Either they traveled by land
through the Bering Strait

00:06:42.933 --> 00:06:45.249
and got all the way down here
in just a thousand years,

00:06:45.249 --> 00:06:47.782
by foot, I mean they were really moving.

00:06:47.782 --> 00:06:52.754
Or they actually were using
some sort of maritime vessel

00:06:52.754 --> 00:06:55.504
to get down, they were in a boat.

00:06:57.446 --> 00:07:00.641
But there's just these
small different theories

00:07:00.641 --> 00:07:04.672
within this archaeological
movement about exactly how

00:07:04.672 --> 00:07:07.893
they moved about and exactly when.

00:07:07.893 --> 00:07:11.071
There's also this new
branch of DNA science

00:07:11.071 --> 00:07:15.302
which is enlightening
historians about who the first

00:07:15.302 --> 00:07:18.375
Native Americans were and who
their direct ancestors are.

00:07:18.375 --> 00:07:19.760
- [Voiceover] These Paleo-Indians,

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.988
they're coming from Alaska,

00:07:21.988 --> 00:07:25.462
they're coming from
Siberia I guess up there,

00:07:25.462 --> 00:07:29.379
so are their direct
ancestors Russians, Asians?

00:07:30.659 --> 00:07:33.820
- [Voiceover] The DNA evidence
points that the Paleo-Indians

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:36.379
were most closely related to the Asians.

00:07:36.379 --> 00:07:40.036
They moved through Asia and
down through the Bering Strait.

00:07:40.036 --> 00:07:41.951
- [Voiceover] Interesting,
so that kinda corraborrates

00:07:41.951 --> 00:07:44.763
the archaeological record, right?

00:07:44.763 --> 00:07:48.930
If we say that somewhere
between 10 and 16,000 years ago

00:07:49.839 --> 00:07:53.286
there was a splintering of this population

00:07:53.286 --> 00:07:55.176
from the Asian population.

00:07:55.176 --> 00:07:58.214
The Bering Strait became water again,

00:07:58.214 --> 00:08:01.400
and now in sort of classic
Darwin fashion we have

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.944
two separated populations
evolving differently.

00:08:04.944 --> 00:08:06.709
- [Voiceover] Exactly,
and the DNA definitely

00:08:06.709 --> 00:08:08.894
corraborrates that evidence.

00:08:08.894 --> 00:08:11.820
So today archaeologists and DNA scientists

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:13.962
are working together to
figure out really which

00:08:13.962 --> 00:08:16.365
of these hypotheses is more true.

00:08:16.365 --> 00:08:20.291
Did they move by land or was it by water?

00:08:20.291 --> 00:08:24.087
And they wanna learn more
about exactly who were they?

00:08:24.087 --> 00:08:27.831
Yeah, they were Asian but how
did they distance themselves

00:08:27.831 --> 00:08:30.251
from the rest of the
East Asian population?

00:08:30.251 --> 00:08:32.375
Really, what motivated
them to come down through

00:08:32.375 --> 00:08:35.884
the Bering Strait and
explore this territory?

00:08:35.884 --> 00:08:37.573
- [Voiceover] One thing that
I think is really important

00:08:37.573 --> 00:08:41.386
to take away from this is that
if you look at the history

00:08:41.386 --> 00:08:45.053
of the Americas, you
start 16,000 years ago,

00:08:45.974 --> 00:08:48.908
and the history of
Europeans in America is just

00:08:48.908 --> 00:08:51.929
a tiny fraction of that time,

00:08:51.929 --> 00:08:56.804
so the history of America
starts long before 1776,

00:08:56.804 --> 00:08:58.833
long before 1492.

00:08:58.833 --> 00:09:02.037
It starts when the first
people came to America

00:09:02.037 --> 00:09:03.621
15,000 years ago.

00:09:03.621 --> 00:09:05.415
- [Voiceover] Exactly, and
the Paleo-Indians started

00:09:05.415 --> 00:09:07.539
their own American history
much before Columbus

00:09:07.539 --> 00:09:10.098
sailed the ocean blue in 1492, right?

00:09:10.098 --> 00:09:11.178
(giggling)

00:09:11.178 --> 00:09:13.041
And archaeologists are
continuing to learn more

00:09:13.041 --> 00:09:15.366
about the first Americans
and really the beginning

00:09:15.366 --> 00:09:16.369
of American history.
