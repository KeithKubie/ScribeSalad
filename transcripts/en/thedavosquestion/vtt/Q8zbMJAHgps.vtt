&gt;&gt; Hello, I'm Heather Kitt and I'm a Global
Change Maker here at the World Economic Forum

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:11.560
on the Middle East. I think the concept of
role models are incredibly important as it

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:17.180
cultivates imagination and as Einstein said
"imagination is more important than knowledge".

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:24.159
It inspires us to look beyond our own circle
and aspire to be more and role models kind

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:29.679
of put the pin in the map. The show that it's
possible. However, creating role models is

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:39.100
a very difficult thing. There's no, there's
no, you can't make sure the role models that

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.710
you create people will pay attention to. In
inspiring youth, young people will choose

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.809
whoever they want as a role model and this
is quite dangerous in the sense that they

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.539
can be an ineffective role model. In the United
States and the UK for example, Eminem, a rapper,

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.930
is a very influencial role model. However,
he talks about hitting his wife and you know

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.670
shooting people. Is this the kind of role
model we want to create? And Therefore what

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.810
the question I would like to propose to you,
is how can we ensure that positive role models

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.790
have the positive influence that we need?
