00:00:00.212 --> 00:00:01.692
- [Voiceover] In this
video we're gonna continue

00:00:01.692 --> 00:00:04.369
talking about AC analysis
and the concept of impedance

00:00:04.369 --> 00:00:08.536
as the ratio of voltage to
current and an AC situation,

00:00:09.944 --> 00:00:13.200
and just as a reminder of
the assumptions we've made

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.842
for AC analysis we've assumed
that all of our signals

00:00:16.842 --> 00:00:21.009
are of the form of some kind
of a sinusoid like that,

00:00:22.063 --> 00:00:24.382
cosine is the typical one we pick,

00:00:24.382 --> 00:00:27.274
cosine omega T plus some offset angle.

00:00:27.274 --> 00:00:30.125
And we're also going
to use Euler's equation

00:00:30.125 --> 00:00:32.882
which says we can decompose our cosine

00:00:32.882 --> 00:00:35.775
into two complex exponentials,

00:00:35.775 --> 00:00:39.942
so one of the complex
exponentials is either the plus J

00:00:41.756 --> 00:00:43.006
omega T plus fi

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:50.286
and J multiplies both of
them, plus e to the minus J

00:00:54.611 --> 00:00:55.944
omega T plus fi.

00:00:59.323 --> 00:01:01.351
And when we use Euler's
theorem what we do is

00:01:01.351 --> 00:01:05.058
we love putting these things
through differential equations

00:01:05.058 --> 00:01:07.608
so we track each of these
one at a time through

00:01:07.608 --> 00:01:10.034
our circuits and typically
what I'll focus on

00:01:10.034 --> 00:01:13.014
is the plus term, but the
minus term all the math

00:01:13.014 --> 00:01:15.769
is the same except there's
that one little minus sign.

00:01:15.769 --> 00:01:18.360
And so when we made up
the concept of impedance,

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.488
we assumed that V or I was of this form,

00:01:22.488 --> 00:01:25.958
this complex exponential, and
that may, when we put that

00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:28.224
through our components
we came up with the idea

00:01:28.224 --> 00:01:31.974
of impedance, and as a
review for a resistor,

00:01:32.856 --> 00:01:36.485
the impedance of a resistor
turned out to be just R,

00:01:36.485 --> 00:01:40.161
that's the ratio of V to I in a resistor.

00:01:40.161 --> 00:01:41.828
And for an inductor,

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.977
we decided Z of an inductor
was equal to J omega L.

00:01:53.012 --> 00:01:56.262
And finally for a capacitor of value C,

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.190
Z C equals one over J omega C.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.966
So those are the three forms of,

00:02:07.966 --> 00:02:10.529
those are the three impedences
of our three favorite

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:12.112
passive components.

00:02:13.134 --> 00:02:16.967
And the units of these,
the units are in ohms.

00:02:18.043 --> 00:02:21.319
R is measured in ohms,
that's the normal ohms law,

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.700
and we use the same units
for impedance of inductors

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.867
and capacitors so this is
in ohms and this is in ohms.

00:02:31.338 --> 00:02:33.852
That may seem a little funny
that because there's this

00:02:33.852 --> 00:02:37.852
frequency term in here,
but, this is what it is.

00:02:38.821 --> 00:02:41.042
So in the rest of this
video I want to look at

00:02:41.042 --> 00:02:44.551
qualitatively look at the
value of these impedences

00:02:44.551 --> 00:02:47.048
and specifically look at
what happens when there's

00:02:47.048 --> 00:02:49.726
a range of values of the omega term,

00:02:49.726 --> 00:02:52.716
what happens at zero
frequency and low frequency

00:02:52.716 --> 00:02:55.396
and high frequency and infinite frequency.

00:02:55.396 --> 00:02:57.896
So let's go ahead and do that.

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:05.167
So we're gonna look at the
impedance terms at different

00:03:05.167 --> 00:03:07.728
frequencies and we'll
measure frequency at radiant

00:03:07.728 --> 00:03:11.150
frequency in this, so, let's
talk about zero frequency

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.115
and we'll talk about low frequency,

00:03:14.115 --> 00:03:15.721
these are qualitative boundaries,

00:03:15.721 --> 00:03:18.360
we'll talk about high frequency,

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.252
and let's talk about infinite frequency.

00:03:21.252 --> 00:03:25.290
So we're gonna build a little chart here.

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.040
Alright so these are
the value of omega here.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.261
And now we'll do our
components, so I'm gonna do,

00:03:33.261 --> 00:03:36.152
first we'll do our resistor,

00:03:36.152 --> 00:03:40.021
and we're gonna fill in the table for ZR,

00:03:40.021 --> 00:03:42.003
and we know that equals R.

00:03:42.003 --> 00:03:46.753
So, at any frequency, R is
just R, couldn't be simpler.

00:03:46.753 --> 00:03:50.920
At zero frequency which is
just called DC or battery,

00:03:51.944 --> 00:03:52.777
R is R,

00:03:53.971 --> 00:03:57.842
at any low frequency, R is R, R is R,

00:03:57.842 --> 00:04:00.600
at infinite frequency, so there's
no dependence on frequency

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.517
in R, so now let's do the inductor,

00:04:06.615 --> 00:04:10.782
and we decided that Z of
an inductor was J omega L.

00:04:15.318 --> 00:04:17.841
And let me do something
very specific, I'm gonna do,

00:04:17.841 --> 00:04:20.479
I'm gonna get rid of this
J, I'm gonna basically say

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:25.105
I wanna just look at the
magnitude of the impedance.

00:04:25.105 --> 00:04:26.950
If we just look at the magnitudes,

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.200
the magnitude of Z inductor is omega L.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.997
So now let's fill our
table in for omega L.

00:04:39.997 --> 00:04:41.830
So when omega is zero,

00:04:43.264 --> 00:04:46.485
the magnitude of the impedance
is zero for an inductor.

00:04:46.485 --> 00:04:50.568
And when the frequency is
low, when omega is low,

00:04:51.642 --> 00:04:55.933
the impedance is going
to be relatively low.

00:04:55.933 --> 00:04:58.516
And as the frequency gets high,

00:04:59.445 --> 00:05:03.612
then omega L becomes a larger
number, so it becomes high.

00:05:05.063 --> 00:05:08.939
And if the frequency, if we let
the frequency go to infinity

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:13.106
then omega becomes infinity
and this becomes infinity.

00:05:14.686 --> 00:05:18.114
So we see an inductor from low
frequency to high frequency,

00:05:18.114 --> 00:05:22.281
the impedance of the inductor
goes from zero up to infinity.

00:05:23.605 --> 00:05:26.295
Alright let's fill in the last one here,

00:05:26.295 --> 00:05:28.045
here's our capacitor,

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:33.636
and the Z of a capacitor
equals one over J omega C,

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:40.736
and the magnitude of the
impedance is just 1 over omega C.

00:05:47.014 --> 00:05:50.816
Alright so let's plot that
out, what is 1 over omega C

00:05:50.816 --> 00:05:52.399
when omega is zero?

00:05:53.288 --> 00:05:54.871
Well it's infinity.

00:05:58.451 --> 00:06:01.636
And what if omega is a small number?

00:06:01.636 --> 00:06:05.803
If omega is a small number
then this is a large number.

00:06:07.976 --> 00:06:09.809
This is a high number.

00:06:11.444 --> 00:06:15.037
And if the frequency gets very
high, the higher omega gets

00:06:15.037 --> 00:06:18.461
the smaller the magnitude of Z gets,

00:06:18.461 --> 00:06:22.378
so we get low here, you
see it's anti symmetric

00:06:23.724 --> 00:06:27.872
with the inductor, and finally,
if we let the frequency

00:06:27.872 --> 00:06:32.156
go to infinity, 1 over
infinity times C is what?

00:06:32.156 --> 00:06:33.656
Is about, is zero.

00:06:36.358 --> 00:06:38.802
With this chart I can show you
some of the words that we use

00:06:38.802 --> 00:06:41.436
some of the sort of slang
words or jargon words

00:06:41.436 --> 00:06:43.625
that we use in electrical
engineering to describe

00:06:43.625 --> 00:06:48.050
the behavior of L and C
at different frequencies.

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:51.029
So as we said, R is R at any frequency,

00:06:51.029 --> 00:06:53.089
so resistance is constant.

00:06:53.089 --> 00:06:55.852
An inductor it changes over frequency,

00:06:55.852 --> 00:06:58.658
over this big range of
frequency, and at zero frequency

00:06:58.658 --> 00:07:02.237
or low frequencies the
impedance is very low.

00:07:02.237 --> 00:07:05.041
So this leads to the
expression we say an inductor

00:07:05.041 --> 00:07:06.624
looks like a short.

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.393
An inductor looks like a
short at low frequency,

00:07:14.393 --> 00:07:16.499
at zero frequency or low frequency.

00:07:16.499 --> 00:07:19.558
And now let's go to high
frequency, the impedance gets high

00:07:19.558 --> 00:07:22.073
and it eventually goes to infinity.

00:07:22.073 --> 00:07:24.463
That's the impedance of an open circuit.

00:07:24.463 --> 00:07:27.546
So we say L equals an open at high F,

00:07:31.578 --> 00:07:35.745
high frequency, and it's
a short at low frequency.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.266
Let's do the same sort of
jargon investigation here

00:07:40.266 --> 00:07:42.083
for our capacitor.

00:07:42.083 --> 00:07:45.420
A capacitor at zero frequency
has an infinite impedance.

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:47.101
So it looks like what?

00:07:47.101 --> 00:07:50.351
It looks like an open at low frequency.

00:07:58.649 --> 00:08:00.659
So let's go look over at high frequencies,

00:08:00.659 --> 00:08:03.629
high frequencies, the
impedance becomes very low.

00:08:03.629 --> 00:08:06.676
And at infinite frequency
it becomes zero and that's

00:08:06.676 --> 00:08:09.187
the impedance of a perfect short.

00:08:09.187 --> 00:08:11.627
So the expression, the
slang expression you'll hear

00:08:11.627 --> 00:08:15.794
is that a capacitor is a short
circuit at high frequency.

00:08:23.503 --> 00:08:25.448
So the reason I'm telling you about this,

00:08:25.448 --> 00:08:29.794
very often experienced
engineers will talk to beginners

00:08:29.794 --> 00:08:32.142
and use these kinds of terms,
that oh an inductor looks

00:08:32.142 --> 00:08:34.003
like a short at low frequency.

00:08:34.003 --> 00:08:36.387
And I wanted to show you
where these things come from,

00:08:36.387 --> 00:08:38.403
where these terms come
from and what they mean.

00:08:38.403 --> 00:08:41.832
And this is not a simple idea,
you saw how many assumptions

00:08:41.832 --> 00:08:44.186
we made and how much work
we did to get to this idea

00:08:44.186 --> 00:08:48.103
of these sort of common
or familiar expressions

00:08:48.962 --> 00:08:51.844
for how our components work.

00:08:51.844 --> 00:08:55.633
I hope that helped for you
to see how this comes about.
