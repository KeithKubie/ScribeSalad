00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.950
Where I left off in the last
video, we talked about how the

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:07.440
hemoglobin in red blood cells
is what sops up all of the

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.440
oxygen so that it increases the
diffusion gradient-- or it

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.800
increases the incentive, we
could say, for the oxygen to

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:15.760
go across the membrane.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.390
We know that the oxygen
molecules don't know that

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.185
there's less oxygen here, but
if you watch the video on

00:00:21.185 --> 00:00:23.170
diffusion you know how
that process happens.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.840
If there's less concentration
here than there, the oxygen

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.070
will diffuse across the membrane
and there's less

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.010
inside the plasma because the
hemoglobin is sucking it all

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.510
up like a sponge.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.060
Now, one interesting question
is, why does the hemoglobin

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.570
even have to reside within
the red blood cells?

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.680
Why aren't hemoglobin proteins
just freely floating in the

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.650
blood plasma?

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.060
That seems more efficient.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.020
You don't have to have things
crossing through, in and out

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.220
of, these red blood
cell membranes.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.380
You wouldn't have to make
red blood cells.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.570
What's the use of having these
containers of hemoglobin?

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.920
It's actually a very
interesting idea.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.519
If you had all of the hemoglobin
sitting in your

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.960
blood plasma, it would
actually hurt

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.450
the flow of the blood.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.500
The blood would become more
viscous or more thick.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.430
I don't want to say like syrup,
but it would become

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.520
thicker than blood is right
now-- and by packaging the

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.700
hemoglobin inside these
containers, inside the red

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.270
blood cells, what it allows
the blood to do

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.800
is flow a lot better.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.610
Imagine if you wanted to
put syrup in water.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.890
If you just put syrup
straight into water,

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:31.650
what's going to happen?

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.100
The water's going to become a
little syrupy, a little bit

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.510
more viscous and not
flow as well.

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:37.930
So what's the solution
if you wanted to

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.370
transport syrup in water?

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.940
Well, you could put the syrup
inside little containers or

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.140
inside little beads and then
let the beads flow in the

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.540
water and then the water
wouldn't be all gooey-- and

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.520
that's exactly what's happening
inside of our blood.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.980
Instead of having the hemoglobin
sit in the plasma

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.440
and make it gooey, it sits
inside these beads that we

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.640
call red blood cells that allows
the flow to still be

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.420
non-viscous.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.800
So I've been all zoomed in here
on the alveolus and these

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.000
capillaries, these pulmonary
capillaries-- let's zoom out a

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.920
little bit-- or zoom out a lot--
just to understand, how

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.130
is the blood flowing?

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.790
And get a better understanding
of pulmonary arteries and

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.920
veins relative to the other
arteries and veins

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.140
that are in the body.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.740
So here-- I copied this from
Wikipedia, this diagram of the

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.810
human circulatory system--
and here in the back

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.310
you can see the lungs.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.220
Let me do it in a
nice dark color.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.880
So we have our lungs here.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.890
You can see the heart is sitting
right in the middle.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.110
And what we learned in the last
few videos is that we

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.260
have our little alveoli
and our lungs.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.780
Remember, we get to them from
our bronchioles, which are

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.190
branching off of the bronchi,
which branch off of the

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.590
trachea, which connects to our
larynx, which connects to our

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.900
pharynx, which connects
to our mouth and nose.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.350
But anyway, we have our little
alveoli right there and then

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.880
we have the capillaries.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:15.450
So when we go away from the
heart-- and we're going to

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.910
delve a little bit into the
heart in this video as well--

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.140
so when blood travels away
from the heart, it's

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.130
de-oxygenated.

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:22.230
It's this blue color.

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.960
So this right here is blood.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.050
This right here is blood
traveling away from the heart.

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.310
It's going behind these
two tubes right there.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.230
So this is the blood going
away from the heart.

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.250
So this blue that I've been
highlighting just now, these

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.620
are the pulmonary arteries and
then they keep splitting into

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.900
arterials and all of that
and eventually we're in

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.600
capillaries-- super,
super small tubes.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.690
They run right past the alveoli
and then they become

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:58.270
oxygenated and now we're going
back to the heart.

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:00.730
So we're talking about
pulmonary veins.

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.080
So we go back to the heart.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.590
So these capillaries-- in the
capillaries we get oxygen.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.600
Now we're going to go
back to the heart.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.090
Hope you can see
what I'm doing.

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.450
And we're going to enter
the heart on this side.

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:16.709
You actually can't even
see where we're

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:17.290
entering the heart.

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.050
We're going to enter the heart
right over here-- and I'm

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.709
going to go into more
detail on that.

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.040
Now we have oxygenated blood.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.850
It's red.

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.650
And then that gets pumped out
to the rest of the body.

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.480
Now this is the interesting
thing.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.060
When we're talking about
pulmonary arteries and veins--

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.170
remember, the pulmonary
artery was blue.

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.240
As we go away from the heart,
we have de-oxygenated blood,

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.610
but it's still an artery.

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.070
Then as we go towards the heart
from the lungs, we have

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.400
a vein, but it's oxygenated.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.990
So that's this little loop here
that we start and I'm

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.760
going to keep going over the
circulation pattern because

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.560
the heart can get a little
confusing, especially because

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.270
of its three-dimensional
nature.

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:27.010
But what we have is, the heart
pumps de-oxygenated blood from

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:28.090
the right ventricle.

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:29.500
You're saying, hey, why is
it the right ventricle?

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.600
That looks like the left side of
the drawing, but it's this

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.590
dude's right-hand side, right?

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.680
This is this guy's right hand.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.100
And this is this dude's
left hand.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.570
He's looking at us, right?

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:41.790
We don't care about
our right or left.

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:43.650
We care about this guy's
right and left.

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:44.530
And he's looking at us.

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.210
He's got some eyeballs and
he's looking at us.

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:48.790
So this is his right
ventricle.

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:51.060
Actually, let me just start
off with the whole cycle.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.110
So we have de-oxygenated blood
coming from the rest of the

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:55.360
body, right?

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.220
The name for this big pipe is
called the inferior vena

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.310
cava-- inferior because
it's coming up below.

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.680
Actually, you have blood coming
up from the arms and

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.080
the head up here.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:19.620
They're both meeting right here,
in the right atrium.

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:20.950
Let me label that.

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:22.860
I'm going to do a big diagram
of the heart in a second.

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:27.610
And why are they
de-oxygenated?

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:31.100
Because this is blood returning
from our legs if

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:35.330
we're running, or returning from
our brain, that had to

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.450
use respiration-- or maybe we're
working out and it's

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:40.370
returning from our biceps, but
it's de-oxygenated blood.

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:42.400
It shows up right here
in the right atrium.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.280
It's on our left, but this
guy's right-hand side.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.400
From the right atrium,
it gets pumped

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.630
into the right ventricle.

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:53.860
It actually passively flows
into the right ventricle.

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.530
The ventricles do all the
pumping, then the ventricle

00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:00.260
contracts and pumps this blood
right here-- and you don't see

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.980
it, but it's going behind
this part right here.

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:05.740
It goes from here through
this pipe.

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:06.580
So you don't see it.

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.970
I'm going to do a detailed
diagram in a second-- into the

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:11.400
pulmonary artery.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.930
We're going away
from the heart.

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:14.790
This was a vein, right?

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:19.640
This is a vein going
to the heart.

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:24.130
This is a vein, inferior
vena cava vein.

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:25.560
This is superior vena cava.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:25.990
These are veins.

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:27.140
They're de-oxygenated.

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:30.510
Then I'm pumping this
de-oxygenated blood away from

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:32.340
the heart to the lungs.

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:35.620
Now this de-oxygenated blood,
this is in an artery, right?

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:37.670
This is in the pulmonary
artery.

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:41.230
It gets oxygenated and now
it's a pulmonary vein.

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:45.570
And once it's oxygenated, it
shows up here in the left--

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:49.060
let me do a better color than
that-- it shows up right here

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:50.590
in the left atrium.

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:53.830
Atrium, you can imagine-- it's
kind of a room with a skylight

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:57.650
or that's open to the outside
and in both of these cases,

00:07:57.650 --> 00:07:59.900
things are entering from above--
not sunlight, but

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:02.320
blood is entering from above.

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:05.320
On the right atrium, the blood
is entering from above.

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.110
And in the left atrium, the
blood is entering-- and

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:09.950
remember, the left atrium is
on the right-hand side from

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:12.580
our point of view-- on the
left atrium, the blood is

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:16.320
entering from above from
the lungs, from

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.120
the pulmonary veins.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.110
Veins go to the heart.

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:24.500
Then it goes into-- and I'll go
into more detail-- into the

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.810
left ventricle and then the
left ventricle pumps that

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:33.020
oxygenated blood to the rest
of the body via the

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.610
non-pulmonary arteries.

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:36.539
So everything pumps out.

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:39.520
Let me make it a nice dark,
non-blue color.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.179
So it pumps it out
through there.

00:08:41.179 --> 00:08:43.169
You don't see it right here,
the way it's drawn.

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:45.060
It's a little bit of
a strange drawing.

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:47.610
It's hard to visualize, but I'll
show it in more detail

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:49.420
and then it goes to the
rest of the body.

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:51.130
Let me show you that
detail right now.

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:56.750
So we said, we have
de-oxygenated blood.

00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:58.350
Let's label it right here.

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:01.590
This is the superior
vena cava.

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:03.960
This is a vein from the upper
part of our body from

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:04.980
our arms and heads.

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:06.540
This is the inferior
vena vaca.

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:10.910
This is veins from our abdomen
and from our legs and the rest

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:11.810
of our body.

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:14.560
So it it first enters
the right atrium.

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:18.460
Remember, we call the right
atrium because this is

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:20.650
someone's heart facing us, even
though this is on the

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:21.710
left-hand side.

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:22.880
It enters through here.

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.790
It's de-oxygenated blood.

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:26.240
It's coming from veins.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:28.260
the body used the oxygen.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.100
Then it shows up in the right
ventricle, right?

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:34.670
These are valves in our heart.

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:37.440
And it passively, once the right
ventricle pumps and then

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:40.350
releases, it has a vacuum and
it pulls more blood from the

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:40.770
right atrium.

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:44.550
It pumps again and then it
pushes it through here.

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:47.110
Now this blood right here--
remember, this one still is

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:49.140
de-oxygenated blood.

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:52.910
De-oxygenated blood goes
to the lungs to become

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:54.190
oxygenated.

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:59.350
So this right here is the
pulmonary-- I'm using the word

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:02.370
pulmonary because it's going
to or from the lungs.

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:03.970
It's dealing with the lungs.

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:05.850
And it's going away
from the heart.

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:13.590
It's the pulmonary artery
and it is de-oxygenated.

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:25.190
Then it goes to the heart, rubs
up against some alveoli

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:31.060
and then gets oxygenated and
then it comes right back.

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:36.990
Now this right here, we're
going to the heart.

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:38.240
So that's a vein.

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:45.650
It's in the loop with the lungs
so it's a pulmonary vein

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:49.000
and it rubbed up against the
alveoli and got the oxygen

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.625
diffused into it so
it is oxygenated.

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:56.740
And then it flows into
your left atrium.

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:58.520
Now, the left atrium, once
again, from our point of view,

00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:00.530
is on the right-hand side, but
from the dude looking at it,

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:02.230
it's his left-hand side.

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:04.050
So it goes into the
left atrium.

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:06.650
Now in the left ventricle, after
it's done pumping, it

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:10.110
expands and that oxygenated
blood flows

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:11.380
into the left ventricle.

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:13.880
Then the left ventricle-- the
ventricles are what do all the

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.870
pumping-- it squeezes and
then it pumps the

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:19.650
blood into the aorta.

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:24.125
This is an artery.

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:28.200
Why is it an artery?

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.390
Because we're going away
from the heart.

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:31.950
Is it a pulmonary artery?

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:35.370
No, we're not dealing with
the lungs anymore.

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:37.020
We dealt with the lungs when
we went from the right

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:38.920
ventricle, went to the
lungs in a loop,

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.560
back to the left atrium.

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:43.770
Now we're in the
left ventricle.

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:44.900
We pump into the aorta.

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:46.550
Now this is to go to the
rest of the body.

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:50.020
This is an artery, a
non-pulmonary artery-- and it

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:51.270
is oxygenated.

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:56.490
So when we're dealing with
non-pulmonary arteries, we're

00:11:56.490 --> 00:12:00.040
oxygenated, but a pulmonary
artery has no oxygen.

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:02.500
It's going away from the heart
to get the oxygen.

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:05.250
Pulmonary vein comes from the
lungs to the heart with

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:08.950
oxygen, but the rest of the
veins go to the heart without

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:11.740
oxygen because they want to
go into that loop on the

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:13.880
pulmonary loop right there.

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:14.700
So I'll leave you there.

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:16.480
Hopefully that gives-- actually,
let's go back to

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:17.200
that first diagram.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:20.780
I think you have a sense of how
the heart is dealing, but

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:22.750
let's go look at the rest
of the body and just

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:25.340
get a sense of things.

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:27.170
You can look this up on
Wikipedia if you like.

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:29.220
All of these different
branching points have

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:34.200
different names to them, but
you can see right here you

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:37.450
have kind of a branching off, a
little bit below the heart.

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:39.080
This is actually the
celiac trunk.

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:45.040
Celiac, if I remember correctly,
kind of refers to

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.080
an abdomen.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:50.510
So this blood that-- your
hepatic artery.

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:53.940
Hepatic deals with the liver.

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:56.800
Your hepatic artery branches off
of this to get blood flow

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:57.970
to the liver.

00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:01.120
It also gives blood flow to
your stomach so it's very

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.780
important in digestion
and all that.

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:05.240
And then let's say this
is the hepatic trunk.

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:07.010
Your liver is sitting
like that.

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:10.070
Hepatic trunk-- it delivers
oxygen to the liver.

00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:12.120
The liver is doing
respiration.

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:15.910
It takes up the oxygen
and then it

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:17.550
gives up carbon dioxide.

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:21.790
So it becomes de-oxygenated and
then it flows back in and

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:24.710
to the inferior vena cava,
into the vein.

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:26.200
I want to make it clear--
it's a loop.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:27.480
It's a big loop.

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.620
The blood doesn't just flow out
someplace and then come

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:31.290
back someplace else.

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:33.200
This is just one big loop.

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.420
And if you want to know at any
given point in time, depending

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:42.010
on your size, there's about
five liters of blood.

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:46.240
And I looked it up-- it takes
the average red blood cell to

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:49.390
go from one point in the
circulatory system and go

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:52.630
through the whole system and
come back, 20 seconds.

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:54.330
That's an average because you
can imagine there might be

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:56.480
some red blood cells that get
stuck someplace and take a

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.930
little bit more time and some
go through the completely

00:13:58.930 --> 00:13:59.900
perfect route.

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:01.790
Actually, the 20 seconds
might be closer

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:02.740
to the perfect route.

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:04.190
I've never timed it myself.

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:06.230
But it's an interesting thing to
look at and to think about

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:07.690
what's connected to what.

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:12.150
You have these these arteries up
here that they first branch

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:17.170
off the arteries up here from
the aorta into the head and

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:20.650
the neck and the arm arteries
and then later they go down

00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:26.560
and they flow blood to
the rest of the body.

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.950
So anyway, this is a pretty
interesting idea.

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:35.250
In the next video, what I want
to do is talk about, how does

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:40.110
the hemoglobin know when
to dump the oxygen?

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:43.310
Or even better, where to dump
the oxygen-- because maybe I'm

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:45.830
running so I need a lot of
oxygen in the capillaries

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:47.340
around my thigh muscles.

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:49.410
I don't need them necessarily
in my hands.

00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:53.700
How does the body optimize where
the oxygen is actually

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:53.915
delivering?

00:14:53.915 --> 00:14:55.670
It's actually fascinating.
