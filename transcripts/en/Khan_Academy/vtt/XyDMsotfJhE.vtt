00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.140
We're asked to graph the circle.

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:04.819
And they give us this somewhat
crazy looking equation.

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:06.610
And then we could graph
it right over here.

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.109
And to graph a circle, you have
to know where its center is,

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:12.080
and you have to know
what its radius is.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.590
So let me see if
I can change that.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.400
And you have to know
what its radius is.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.480
So what we need to do
is put this in some form

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.330
where we can pick out its
center and its radius.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.510
Let me get my little scratch pad
out and see if we can do that.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:24.995
So this is that same equation.

00:00:24.995 --> 00:00:26.370
And what I
essentially want to do

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.840
is I want to complete
the square in terms of x,

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.930
and complete the square in terms
of y, to put it into a form

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.730
that we can recognize.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.865
So first let's take
all of the x terms.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.630
So you have x squared and
4x on the left-hand side.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.357
So I could rewrite this
as x squared plus 4x.

00:00:46.357 --> 00:00:48.440
And I'm going to put some
parentheses around here,

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.370
because I'm going to
complete the square.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.690
And then I have my y terms.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.280
I'll circle those
in-- well, the red

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.571
looks too much like the purple.

00:00:54.571 --> 00:00:56.010
I'll circle those in blue.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.860
y squared and negative 4y.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:05.420
So we have plus y
squared minus 4y.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.972
And then we have a minus 17.

00:01:08.972 --> 00:01:10.680
And I'll just do that
in a neutral color.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.820
So minus 17 is equal to 0.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.920
Now, what I want
to do is make each

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.050
of these purple expressions
perfect squares.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.260
So how could I do that here?

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.070
Well, this would be a perfect
square if I took half of this 4

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.000
and I squared it.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.280
So if I made this plus 4,
then this entire expression

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.920
would be x plus 2 squared.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.576
And you can verify
that if you like.

00:01:37.576 --> 00:01:39.640
If you need to review on
completing the square,

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.990
there's plenty of videos
on Khan Academy on that.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.500
All we did is we took
half of this coefficient

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.690
and then squared it to get 4.

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.530
Half of 4 is 2,
square it to get 4.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.140
And that comes straight out of
the idea if you take x plus 2

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.380
and square it, it's going
to be x squared plus twice

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.450
the product of 2 and
x, plus 2 squared.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.832
Now, we can't just
willy-nilly add a 4 here.

00:02:03.832 --> 00:02:05.790
We had an equality before,
and just adding a 4,

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.140
it wouldn't be equal anymore.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.009
So if we want to
maintain the equality,

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.110
we have to add 4 on the
right-hand side as well.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.260
Now, let's do the same
thing for the y's.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.020
Half of this coefficient right
over here is a negative 2.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.837
If we square negative 2,
it becomes a positive 4.

00:02:21.837 --> 00:02:23.670
We can't just do that
on the left-hand side.

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.530
We have to do that on the
right-hand side as well.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.750
Now, what we have in blue
becomes y minus 2 squared.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.640
And of course, we
have the minus 17.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.150
But why don't we
add 17 to both sides

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.320
as well to get rid of
this minus 17 here?

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:44.300
So let's add 17 on the left
and add 17 on the right.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.100
So on the left, we're just left
with these two expressions.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.190
And on the right, we
have 4 plus 4 plus 17.

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.190
Well, that's 8 plus 17,
which is equal to 25.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.710
Now, this is a form
that we recognize.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:04.230
If you have the form x minus a
squared plus y minus b squared

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:10.190
is equal to r squared, we know
that the center is at the point

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.740
a, b, essentially,
the point that

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.830
makes both of these equal to 0.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.420
And that the radius
is going to be r.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.310
So if we look over
here, what is our a?

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:23.670
We have to be careful here.

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:24.700
Our a isn't 2.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.550
Our a is negative 2. x minus
negative 2 is equal to 2.

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.740
So the x-coordinate
of our center

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.912
is going to be negative 2, and
the y-coordinate of our center

00:03:34.912 --> 00:03:35.620
is going to be 2.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.965
Remember, we care about the
x value that makes this 0,

00:03:37.965 --> 00:03:40.870
and the y value
that makes this 0.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.890
So the center is negative 2, 2.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.750
And this is the radius squared.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.560
So the radius is equal to 5.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.790
So let's go back to the
exercise and actually plot this.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.230
So it's negative 2, 2.

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.546
So our center is negative 2, 2.

00:03:58.546 --> 00:03:59.670
So that's right over there.

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.320
X is negative 2,
y is positive 2.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.040
And the radius is 5.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.350
So let's see, this
would be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.000
So you have to go a little
bit wider than this.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.450
My pen is having trouble.

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:13.190
There you go.

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.870
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.589
Let's check our answer.

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:19.540
We got it right.
