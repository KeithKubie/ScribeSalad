00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.680
Those two squares were cut out from a single sheet of paper,

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.029
printing paper that I took from my office.

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.039
I put them together like so, and

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:10.090
clamp them together with a binder clip.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.729
Actually when you do this with friends and family at home, you can use your fingers to support those two sheets.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.400
But if I use fingers, people start accusing me of cheating.  So let's introduce some objectivity by using an instrument.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:21.900
So there is a binder clip there.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.439
And if I hold those squares like this, they stick together.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.260
Of course, you say, because they are made of the same material, they react the same way, they sag the same way under gravity,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.920
so there's no reason why

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.040
they don't stick together. But, when I turn them around, they separate.

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:41.649
So on one side

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:47.249
they stick together, on the other side they separate. But there is more to this. This side, you see that

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:54.239
they're separating, and flipped over, you recall, it was the sticky side. While keeping the squares on the separating side,

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.079
let's make the binder migrate to the next edge.

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:05.759
Okay, used to be here and now it's going here. And, I kept them on the separating side, but this time, supported on this edge,

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.400
they stick together.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.140
And the other side, which used to be the sticky side, now separates.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:21.080
So I didn't do anything violent, like a chemical treatment or pulling, and so on. But I did something to them.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.200
And this whole thing comes from the interest in

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.960
anisotropic materials. That is, properties of materials that depend on direction. You know, this direction, this direction,

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.880
different. The modern method of manufacturing paper pulls the paper out of big big roller.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.220
So it introduces some sort of grain in a similar direction, which makes, maybe the resulting paper, this direction, this direction,

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.979
not strictly equivalent. Now, for all practical purposes, this nonequivalence is almost always

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:53.399
invisible and immaterial. But playing with paper and playing with toys like this, you can make them come out,

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:57.749
as follows. So let's make it a bit more clear. Because I'm very fond of toys,

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.740
this is a toy, but I've brought

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.100
a toy of a toy, it's a secondary toy, if you like.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.780
I'm using another toy illustrate the first toy. If you crease paper like this,

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:12.209
it's quite flexible in this direction. In this direction it becomes stiff, you can't bend it anymore.

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.209
Now, that's the ancient technology of

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.760
corrugated surface, of course.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:16.900
But for

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.529
mathematically-minded people, I might tell you about the point. Because I

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.100
curved it in this direction already, if I try to curve it in the other direction,

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.979
I would introduce what is called a non-zero Gaussian curvature,

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.890
which I can't do without violence to paper, which to begin with had zero curvature. And curvature turns out to be an

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.120
invariant, that is, as long as you don't tear, stretch and so on, curvature must be the same.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.960
So if it's zero to begin, with it's zero always.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:43.170
So the Gaussian curvature, in a nutshell, is acting as a stop to being bent.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.530
Or, if you like,

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.530
you know, when we crease a

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:53.370
sheet of paper, or any surface, one of useful reasons for creasing is that when you crease a sheet or membrane or

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.370
surface like this, it becomes more flexible in this direction, but suddenly introduces a bit of rigidity in this direction.

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:06.899
So creasing is a mechanism for introducing directional rigidity. Okay, let's go back. When I saw this sheet of paper from my office,

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:13.620
well, I couldn't tell the microscopic fiber, anisotropy and so forth, precisely because it's too small. But I don't have to know anything.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.059
I just cut out two squares next to each other, and when I assembled them,

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.720
I put them one on top of the other like so. By rotating

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.100
one on top the other by 90 degrees. And in this toy model,

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:33.930
you'll see exactly what happens. If I support those two objects like this, they stick together because the stiff one is at the bottom,

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:35.820
supporting the flex one at the top,

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:41.399
but when I turn around they can separate, because the flex one can sag, but stiff one sticks out. And when I

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:47.339
migrate to the next edge, the sticky and non-separating sides swap their roles. Almost certainly,

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:53.010
this is what is going on microscopally in this model. When I first made this on a normal sheet of paper,

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:59.519
I simply couldn't see the small microscopic scale structures. But it doesn't matter. I just cut two squares and

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.120
rotated one on top of the other by 90 degrees.

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.909
That's all you have to do. In retrospect,

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.660
bookbinders know this, because you have to use the paper in the right direction

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.290
apparently. If you use it in the wrong direction, the book becomes very difficult to open.

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.479
Whereas if you align it in the correct direction, it becomes very easy book to use, and so people who work with paper

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:26.100
know this, of course, from experience.  But at the same time, I mean, I'm quite fond of Japanese calligraphy. You might have seen, this is

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.519
tradition that ultimately comes from China, you just use ink and a very sort of stark sheet of paper,

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.389
and then you do all sorts of things with just black ink, painting or calligraphy.

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:37.668
I'm not so good at this, so I can't really tell the difference.

00:04:37.668 --> 00:04:41.419
But I know that the great masters insist on using paper

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.260
that is manufactured in the traditional way. That is, you start from some sort of pulp mush,

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.140
and you let it sediment without pulling it in any direction,

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:54.120
and then you compress, apparently, that's how you make the paper. So that the little fibers are randomly oriented. In other words, it is quite

00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:01.010
isotropic, it's quite directionally independent. And when those masters draw things like that, well they can go in all directions freely.

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:05.680
Whereas they say, well, if you use the commercial, you know, modern paper, which has some directionality, well,

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.679
you know this stroke is not compatible with that stroke, and so forth, they complain.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.639
I mean I, as I say, I can't tell the difference, but there are people who are sensitive enough to tell the difference.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.440
So there are examples like this too.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:22.520
Yet one more example from really daily life is this. I don't know if it's the first time that toilet paper makes an appearance in numberphile.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.049
If you take a tissue paper, you can try to tear it straight,

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:33.890
and in one direction, it's fairly easy to do so. But if you take the same paper,

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.650
and try to tear in the perpendicular direction,

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:42.950
I've just torn it in this direction, but now I take, it's basically impossible to go straight. You can't tear it.

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.810
And that's certainly because of the anisotropy of paper.

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:51.859
There is a difference between tearing down like this and tearing across like this.

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:56.869
I found this toilet paper from the bathroom of the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute, MSRI,

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:00.079
and I was amused to note that this toilet paper,

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:06.650
comes off the roller like this, is easy to tear straight in this direction, along the length. But across the width,

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:10.459
it's impossible to tear straight. And I thought haha that is funny. But on second thought,

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:15.410
I realized that of course it has to be that way. Because you see, when you tear toilet paper, you want it to be

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:22.489
very difficult to tear, except along the perforations, where you deliberately introduce perforations to, it will be tearable in some units.

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:27.560
So of course, it should be easy to tear along the length, and across the width, you want

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:33.260
it be difficult to tear. So every day I become a little smarter. So you can do this at home. In this direction,

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.659
it's very easy to tear, but in this direction

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:43.060
it's, it's almost impossible. Except along the perforation, where I can, I can tear quite nicely,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
as the paper should.

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:54.699
In the same direction, that's why circulating the same direction that I'm swirling. Because they are not talking to another, they're independent particles.

00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:01.359
In contrast, when you increase the crowdedness, well, whatever linear momentum
