00:00:01.535 --> 00:00:05.172
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

00:00:05.172 --> 00:00:06.974
APPS ARE THOSE THINGS ON YOUR

00:00:06.974 --> 00:00:08.008
PHONE THAT YOU USE WHILE YOU

00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:08.976
IGNORE THE PERSON YOU'RE HAVING

00:00:08.976 --> 00:00:10.377
A CONVERSATION WITH.

00:00:10.377 --> 00:00:11.311
WE FOUND A FEW REALLY GREAT

00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:12.246
RIDICULOUS APPS THAT ACTUALLY

00:00:12.246 --> 00:00:13.113
EXIST.

00:00:13.113 --> 00:00:13.947
SO I'M GOING TO NAME TWO

00:00:13.947 --> 00:00:14.848
POSSIBLE APPS AND FOR 250

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:15.816
POINTS, YOU TELL ME WHICH ONE IS

00:00:15.816 --> 00:00:16.717
REAL.

00:00:16.717 --> 00:00:18.452
HERE'S THE FIRST ONE, AIRPNP, AN

00:00:18.452 --> 00:00:19.987
APP THAT CONNECTS YOU TO PEOPLE

00:00:19.987 --> 00:00:21.088
WHO WILL ALLOW YOU TO USE THEIR

00:00:21.088 --> 00:00:22.022
TOILET.

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:23.590
OR P4-ME, AN APP THAT CONNECTS

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:24.525
YOU TO PEOPLE WHO WILL WATCH YOU

00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:26.093
USE YOUR TOILET.

00:00:26.093 --> 00:00:27.694
PAUL SCHEER.

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:29.296
&gt;&gt; P4-ME HAS TO BE AN APP.

00:00:29.296 --> 00:00:30.230
&gt;&gt; Chris: WELL, I THINK THE

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.298
CORRECT ANSWER IS ACTUALLY

00:00:31.298 --> 00:00:32.633
AIRPNP.

00:00:32.633 --> 00:00:33.567
&gt;&gt; WHAT?!

00:00:33.567 --> 00:00:34.434
&gt;&gt; Chris: YEAH.

00:00:34.434 --> 00:00:35.335
YOU COULD JUST USE SOMEONE'S

00:00:35.335 --> 00:00:36.170
BATHROOM IF YOU'RE ON THE GO.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.104
&gt;&gt; THAT IS REALLY POLITE AND

00:00:37.104 --> 00:00:38.739
NICE AND NOT CREEPY AT ALL.

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:39.740
&gt;&gt; Chris: YEAH, I KNOW.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:40.674
&gt;&gt; I THOUGHT THE INTERNET

00:00:40.674 --> 00:00:41.608
WOULD BE WAY MORE CREEPY.

00:00:41.608 --> 00:00:42.676
&gt;&gt; Chris: WELL, THEY ARE GOING

00:00:42.676 --> 00:00:43.610
TO FILM YOU WHILE YOU ARE DOING

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:44.545
IT.

00:00:44.545 --> 00:00:45.379
YOU ARE NOT DOING IT IN YOUR

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:46.213
TOILET.

00:00:46.213 --> 00:00:47.214
&gt;&gt; THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE.

00:00:47.214 --> 00:00:48.382
&gt;&gt; IS THIS FROM THE SAME PEOPLE

00:00:48.382 --> 00:00:49.316
WHO BROUGHT YOU "DUKE AND

00:00:49.316 --> 00:00:50.450
BOUNCE"?

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.020
(LAUGHTER)

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.854
&gt;&gt; WHAT WE'RE LEARNING FROM THIS

00:00:53.854 --> 00:00:55.289
MAP IS THAT THERE ARE 288 PLACES

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.723
TO DO THIS IN GERMANY.

00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:59.326
(LAUGHTER)

00:00:59.326 --> 00:01:00.260
&gt;&gt; Chris: DEFINITELY.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.463
(LAUGHTER)

00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:05.332
&gt;&gt; (imitating German accent):

00:01:05.332 --> 00:01:06.934
HOW CAN I GET SOME STRANGERS

00:01:06.934 --> 00:01:10.737
INTO MY HOUSE TO PEE HERE?

00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:12.940
THERE MUST BE A WAY.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.074
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:15.275

00:01:29.256 --> 00:01:30.190
&gt;&gt; Chris: PAUL AND BRANDON, KEEP

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.458

JIGGLES AND REACTS TO PINCHING

00:01:37.998 --> 00:01:39.132
AND SLAPPING.

00:01:39.132 --> 00:01:40.734
OR ENCOURAGE-A-BONER, A VIRTUAL

00:01:40.734 --> 00:01:41.935
FLACCID PENIS THAT GETS ERECT

00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:43.570

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.172
(LAUGHTER)

00:01:45.172 --> 00:01:46.173

I THINK IT IS BOTH.

00:02:14.501 --> 00:02:16.069
I THINK IT'S BOTH.

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.237
