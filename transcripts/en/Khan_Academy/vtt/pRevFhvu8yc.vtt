00:00:15.247 --> 00:00:18.036
(applauding)

00:00:18.036 --> 00:00:21.037
Salman: As I just introduced what
Khan Academy is most known for

00:00:21.037 --> 00:00:23.480
is this library of videos
that I started producing

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.207
almost five, six years ago now.

00:00:26.207 --> 00:00:30.599
Before I go any further, let me just
show you all a little bit of a mix

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.682
of what the videos actually look like

00:00:32.682 --> 00:00:34.489
and then we can go a
little deeper from there.

00:00:36.612 --> 00:00:39.252
So the hypotenuse is now going to be five.

00:00:39.252 --> 00:00:42.829
These animals fossils are only
found in this area of South America

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.375
a nice, clean band here
and this part of Africa.

00:00:46.375 --> 00:00:51.568
We can integrate over the surface in
the notation usually is a capital sigma.

00:00:51.568 --> 00:00:54.934
National Assembly they create
the committee of public safety

00:00:54.934 --> 00:00:56.680
which sounds like a very nice committee.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.328
Notice this is an aldehyde
and it's an alcohol

00:01:00.328 --> 00:01:03.764
start differentiating it to
affect or, and memory cells.

00:01:03.764 --> 00:01:06.069
A galaxy, hey there's another galaxy.

00:01:06.069 --> 00:01:07.906
Oh look there's another galaxy.

00:01:07.906 --> 00:01:10.148
For dollars is there 30 million

00:01:10.148 --> 00:01:13.098
plus the 20 million dollars
from the American manufacturer

00:01:13.098 --> 00:01:18.375
if this does not blow your
mind then you have no emotion.

00:01:18.375 --> 00:01:24.430
(audience laughing)

00:01:27.091 --> 00:01:30.344
You know the videos
there's now 2,200 of them.

00:01:30.344 --> 00:01:33.138
That's kind of what I want to
do until I get a hit by a bus

00:01:33.138 --> 00:01:35.132
or hopefully it won't be for a while.

00:01:38.854 --> 00:01:41.347
We're doing a lot more than that,I
mean the videos are reaching ...

00:01:41.347 --> 00:01:44.508
Actually now, on the order of about
two million unique users a month.

00:01:44.508 --> 00:01:47.461
We've had almost 45 million video views

00:01:47.461 --> 00:01:49.700
they are being watched 2
to 300,000 times a day.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.584
Before I go any deeper, I actually just
gave a talk at TED down in Long Beach

00:01:55.584 --> 00:01:58.948
a couple weeks ago, I don't want
this to be a repetition of that talk.

00:01:58.948 --> 00:02:00.243
I want this to kind of be a part two.

00:02:00.243 --> 00:02:02.276
But before I go any further,
I want to get a sense

00:02:02.276 --> 00:02:04.542
just so I know how much background
and depth I need to give.

00:02:04.542 --> 00:02:06.413
How many of you all seen that talk?

00:02:06.413 --> 00:02:07.971
Okay, good.

00:02:07.971 --> 00:02:10.263
How many of you all have been to the site?

00:02:10.263 --> 00:02:13.351
Because I want to know how much
background, okay very good, very good.

00:02:15.166 --> 00:02:19.326
What I want to focus on today is
kind of going a little bit deeper.

00:02:19.326 --> 00:02:23.247
I will give a background about what
we're doing beyond the video portion.

00:02:23.247 --> 00:02:24.573
Now that it isn't just me.

00:02:24.573 --> 00:02:28.547
We are actually kind of a
team now, we're at six people.

00:02:31.777 --> 00:02:33.957
(audience laughing)

00:02:33.957 --> 00:02:37.778
Some of the questions
that I think have surfaced

00:02:37.778 --> 00:02:41.590
is we've gotten a little bit more popular
and we started to enter into domains,

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.176
but frankly I never
thought we would enter.

00:02:43.176 --> 00:02:45.442
Especially into the classroom itself.

00:02:45.442 --> 00:02:49.064
Before I do that,I want to give you all
a little bit of a thought experiment.

00:02:50.064 --> 00:02:54.055
Imagine if we're in a juggling class
and I'm your juggling instructor.

00:02:54.055 --> 00:02:58.049
This week we are going to
learn to juggle oranges.

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.328
I give you all your orange juggling
kits, I give you all each four oranges

00:03:02.328 --> 00:03:04.901
and I give you all a
lecture on juggling oranges.

00:03:04.901 --> 00:03:09.434
I say practice and in a week I will
assess your orange juggling ability.

00:03:10.233 --> 00:03:13.976
You practice and a week later I come
back with my clipboard and I say juggle.

00:03:13.976 --> 00:03:18.378
You try the best you can to juggle
and different three oranges,

00:03:18.378 --> 00:03:22.531
four oranges, all the rest and I say,
"You can't juggle four oranges at all."

00:03:22.531 --> 00:03:26.120
"Three oranges, barely can
keep the oranges in the air"

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.706
"for more than a few seconds."

00:03:27.706 --> 00:03:33.264
You are a 70% orange juggler,
you are a D orange juggler.

00:03:33.264 --> 00:03:35.197
I place that label on your forehead.

00:03:35.197 --> 00:03:38.003
I put it in your permanent
record making it all

00:03:38.003 --> 00:03:40.336
but impossible for you to go
in an elite juggling school.

00:03:40.336 --> 00:03:44.320
(audience laughing)

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.976
Despite those deficiencies that
you clearly have in your abilities,

00:03:47.976 --> 00:03:53.890
there's the state mandated a juggling
curriculum that we have to follow

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.921
and there's a calendar that specifies
how we have to move forward.

00:03:57.921 --> 00:04:00.826
We have this kind of
assembly line and so I say,

00:04:00.826 --> 00:04:05.796
"Well give me back the oranges. The
next lesson here are some knives."

00:04:05.796 --> 00:04:10.618
(audience laughing)

00:04:10.618 --> 00:04:14.955
As crazy as that might appear to be

00:04:14.955 --> 00:04:18.451
that's exactly what's happening
in our classrooms right now.

00:04:18.451 --> 00:04:24.233
It might not be as physically dangerous
but it is just as mentally dangerous.

00:04:24.233 --> 00:04:28.041
We have students they take
an exam, they get 10% wrong,

00:04:28.041 --> 00:04:30.950
20% wrong, 30% wrong, you
can even fail an exam.

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:35.593
Regardless of the fact that we've
identified those deficiencies,

00:04:35.593 --> 00:04:37.876
we know that the student
doesn't know those concepts,

00:04:37.876 --> 00:04:40.944
we have to move on to the next
concept, we have this assembly line.

00:04:40.944 --> 00:04:44.425
That the only thing were using
the test for is to put labels

00:04:44.425 --> 00:04:47.005
on peoples foreheads to
separate them, to track them.

00:04:47.005 --> 00:04:49.143
Though we know there's
weaknesses we push them forward

00:04:49.143 --> 00:04:51.831
and we're pretty much ensuring that at
some future point they'r going to fail.

00:04:51.831 --> 00:04:54.350
We're pretty much ensuring
that motivated kids,

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.927
even if they have awesome
teachers at some point

00:04:56.927 --> 00:04:59.982
those gaps are going to come back and
they're not going to be able to perform

00:04:59.982 --> 00:05:03.437
once they get to some
more advanced mathematics.

00:05:04.067 --> 00:05:07.446
Now that we've gotten a funding ...

00:05:07.446 --> 00:05:10.526
just so you know a little bit of
the story how all of this happened.

00:05:10.526 --> 00:05:16.020
I was literally making videos in
my closet for about five years.

00:05:17.112 --> 00:05:21.224
Then about a year ago Google
brought me over to their campus

00:05:21.224 --> 00:05:23.911
and I thought it was just like
a lot of the Google engineers,

00:05:23.911 --> 00:05:27.282
as parents they were using these videos
for their children and all of that.

00:05:27.282 --> 00:05:29.661
But they brought me in to a
conference room and they said,

00:05:29.661 --> 00:05:31.997
"Sal, what would you do
with two million dollars?"

00:05:31.997 --> 00:05:34.854
(audience laughing)

00:05:34.854 --> 00:05:38.561
I said, "Is this an education context?
Or is just a broader question?"

00:05:38.561 --> 00:05:41.887
(audience laughing)

00:05:41.887 --> 00:05:43.409
There are very different answers.

00:05:45.501 --> 00:05:49.293
That happened and a little bit
later, I mean this is like last year,

00:05:49.293 --> 00:05:50.642
I was still in the closet.

00:05:50.642 --> 00:05:55.331
(audience laughing)

00:05:56.284 --> 00:06:00.570
I get a call from Larry Cohen,
who's Bill Gates chief of staff,

00:06:00.587 --> 00:06:05.417
and says, "I don't know if you realize
this but Bill Gates likes your videos."

00:06:05.417 --> 00:06:08.910
"He watches them, he uses it with his
kids, and he would like to support you."

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.749
"Do you have some time to
meet him in the near future?"

00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:14.296
I said, "I think I can move
around my calendar a little bit."

00:06:14.296 --> 00:06:15.874
(audience laughing)

00:06:15.874 --> 00:06:18.835
I think I can push back a few of
the video recordings here or there.

00:06:18.835 --> 00:06:22.921
But you fast forward to
October of this year,

00:06:22.921 --> 00:06:25.426
we got funding from the Bill
and Melinda Gates Foundation.

00:06:25.426 --> 00:06:27.133
We got the funding from Google.

00:06:27.133 --> 00:06:30.012
In a sense it allowed me
to come out of the closet.

00:06:33.058 --> 00:06:38.456
What we're now trying to do
there is take these videos

00:06:38.456 --> 00:06:43.840
to their natural conclusion, and
address that juggling mastery problem.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.996
What we're doing, if you go
to the site it's all free,

00:06:45.996 --> 00:06:48.425
it's a not for profit, not
trying to sell anything.

00:06:48.425 --> 00:06:54.145
You can start at 1 + 1 = 2 and we'll
give you as many problems as you need.

00:06:54.145 --> 00:06:55.039
As you get 10 in a row,

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:57.741
you can keep advancing to more
and more advanced concepts.

00:06:57.741 --> 00:07:01.719
The paradigm here is don't
move on to a next concept

00:07:01.719 --> 00:07:04.727
until you master the one you already know.

00:07:04.727 --> 00:07:07.245
As an organization what we're trying to do

00:07:07.245 --> 00:07:10.857
and it seems like there's already a little
bit, we're getting the traction here

00:07:10.857 --> 00:07:14.094
and we'll talk later and to talk about
why we think we're getting that traction.

00:07:15.924 --> 00:07:20.056
What we're trying to do is enable
anyone, anywhere in the world for free

00:07:20.056 --> 00:07:24.156
to get one an education but
when we say an education,

00:07:24.156 --> 00:07:27.861
to get an education that really
is a mastery based education.

00:07:27.861 --> 00:07:30.970
One that really ensures that
someone understands the basics

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:34.006
before they move forward and they
can do it all at their own pace.

00:07:34.006 --> 00:07:35.776
I want to be clear, this is actually ...

00:07:35.776 --> 00:07:38.530
We'll talk more about this in
the second half of the talk.

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:39.801
This isn't a new idea,

00:07:39.801 --> 00:07:43.803
it's actually nothing that Khan
Academy doing is fundamentally new.

00:07:43.803 --> 00:07:47.411
Doing videos either online
or even on TV or whatever,

00:07:47.411 --> 00:07:50.017
it's not a new idea when the
radio was first invented,

00:07:50.017 --> 00:07:51.382
when TV was first invented,

00:07:51.382 --> 00:07:53.720
people thought it was going
to revolutionize education.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.555
Put the best teachers, broadcast
them, it never happened.

00:07:56.555 --> 00:07:59.854
Even when the internet kind of came out,

00:07:59.854 --> 00:08:03.265
they thought that was going to be
the killer [happen] for the internet.

00:08:03.265 --> 00:08:05.160
When the PC was first invented,

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.032
they thought this was the first time
we can give people self-pace learning

00:08:08.032 --> 00:08:09.472
but it never got traction.

00:08:09.472 --> 00:08:10.465
In the second half of my talk

00:08:10.465 --> 00:08:13.494
I'd like to think a little bit about
maybe why we're getting a traction.

00:08:13.494 --> 00:08:16.121
It's a super important question
for us as an organization

00:08:16.121 --> 00:08:20.660
because we don't want to lose
whatever that secret sauce might be.

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:24.085
The other interesting
thing that's happened

00:08:24.085 --> 00:08:27.111
and I talk a lot more about
this in the other TED talk,

00:08:27.111 --> 00:08:30.655
and is actually a big surprise to me,

00:08:30.655 --> 00:08:34.056
is that our software and video start
to get adapted in the classroom.

00:08:34.056 --> 00:08:36.936
I mentioned the previous talk
that it happened early on

00:08:36.936 --> 00:08:38.416
even before we got funding or anything.

00:08:38.416 --> 00:08:40.413
I started getting letters
from teachers who's saying

00:08:40.413 --> 00:08:43.392
that they were using just the
videos to flip the education model.

00:08:43.392 --> 00:08:46.245
They were now assigning
the videos for a lecture,

00:08:46.245 --> 00:08:48.410
they were assigning
the videos for homework

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:50.243
and instead of doing a
lecture in the classroom,

00:08:50.243 --> 00:08:53.949
they were actually allowing their
students to interact with each other

00:08:53.949 --> 00:08:55.221
in doing problems.

00:08:55.221 --> 00:08:58.750
Just with that simple technology,
just the on demand video

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:01.586
they were actually able
to kind of personalize

00:09:01.586 --> 00:09:04.942
and make the actual classroom
experience interactive.

00:09:04.942 --> 00:09:09.913
Now with this kind of self-paced
mastery base learning software,

00:09:09.913 --> 00:09:14.036
we were approached by the Los Altos
School District not to far from here,

00:09:14.036 --> 00:09:15.661
"What would you do with a classroom?"

00:09:17.522 --> 00:09:20.217
We said, "Well we would let every
student work at their own pace."

00:09:20.217 --> 00:09:23.319
The teachers role would
be, they have a dashboard,

00:09:23.319 --> 00:09:24.768
they would have all of the data

00:09:24.768 --> 00:09:27.375
and only intervene on the
students that are stuck.

00:09:27.375 --> 00:09:29.493
So you could do a very
focused intervention

00:09:29.493 --> 00:09:31.407
and be armed with the right data to do it.

00:09:31.407 --> 00:09:34.035
Or even better get a student
who's already proficient in that

00:09:34.035 --> 00:09:35.774
to intervene on that student

00:09:35.774 --> 00:09:38.543
and then you get all the benefits
of learning something even deeper

00:09:38.543 --> 00:09:40.827
when you yourself are the teacher.

00:09:40.827 --> 00:09:43.326
They decided to do it.

00:09:43.326 --> 00:09:49.031
In Los Altos we have two fifth grade
classes and two seventh grade classes

00:09:49.031 --> 00:09:51.971
and they're using this
as their core curriculum.

00:09:51.971 --> 00:09:54.946
What I want to emphasize here
and it's not always made clear

00:09:54.946 --> 00:09:57.939
is when I talk about this to
people, a lot of people will say,

00:09:57.939 --> 00:09:59.038
"Oh this awesome."

00:09:59.038 --> 00:10:02.458
Self-pace learning, mastery based,
differentiate in instruction

00:10:02.458 --> 00:10:05.275
but there is a crowd that starts
to get a little suspicious.

00:10:05.275 --> 00:10:10.326
They start saying well, "This sounds
like you're automating things"

00:10:10.326 --> 00:10:12.693
"but it sounds like it's very robotic."

00:10:12.693 --> 00:10:18.323
"It sounds like kids in front of a
computer just doing exercises all day,"

00:10:18.323 --> 00:10:20.882
"listening to videos, not
interacting with each other."

00:10:20.882 --> 00:10:23.236
"It sounds like you're
marginalizing the teacher."

00:10:23.236 --> 00:10:25.308
"It sounds your deskilling the teacher,"

00:10:25.308 --> 00:10:29.859
"that you're making them just
do what the computers can't."

00:10:29.859 --> 00:10:33.193
What I want to emphasize
here is the exact opposite.

00:10:33.193 --> 00:10:35.466
What we're seeing in those
classrooms in Los Altos,

00:10:35.466 --> 00:10:38.879
is we're seeing every
moment of that teachers time

00:10:38.879 --> 00:10:42.776
is spent interacting with
her students, being a mentor.

00:10:42.776 --> 00:10:45.984
These students are getting one on one
with the teacher multiple times a week.

00:10:45.984 --> 00:10:49.228
When I was in school I was lucky
to get that even a few times,

00:10:49.228 --> 00:10:50.860
and even in your whole career.

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:52.307
Multiple times a week.

00:10:52.307 --> 00:10:56.655
They aren't doing this at the
expense of project based learning

00:10:56.655 --> 00:10:57.592
or investigations.

00:10:57.592 --> 00:11:00.430
What this is allowing the teacher
to do, it liberates the classroom.

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:03.184
So now that they can do more
of the project based learning,

00:11:03.184 --> 00:11:04.707
they can do more of the investigations.

00:11:04.707 --> 00:11:08.785
These classrooms in Los Altos, there
is more of that creative activity,

00:11:08.785 --> 00:11:13.009
more of this interaction, more of
this experimenting with the world

00:11:13.009 --> 00:11:15.016
than you would see in any other classroom.

00:11:15.016 --> 00:11:16.633
So for the first time because
we have this technology

00:11:16.633 --> 00:11:18.184
it's not an either or proposition.

00:11:18.184 --> 00:11:20.724
You have this kind of camps
of mathematical instruction.

00:11:20.724 --> 00:11:22.989
Do you do kind of the traditional,

00:11:22.989 --> 00:11:27.011
do a lot of problems, lecture and
see a lot of traditional problems?

00:11:27.011 --> 00:11:29.744
Or do you do the project based
learning where you investigate things?

00:11:29.744 --> 00:11:32.099
Our answer is now we can do both.

00:11:32.099 --> 00:11:34.784
Even better, even on the instruction
itself there's these debates

00:11:34.784 --> 00:11:37.559
between old Math and
new Math, how you to it?

00:11:37.559 --> 00:11:40.243
The value when you have on
demand video, you can do both.

00:11:40.243 --> 00:11:43.265
You can actually expose the
students to every possible way

00:11:43.265 --> 00:11:44.882
that there is to learn Mathematics.

00:11:44.882 --> 00:11:48.696
In the same classroom, you have
one kid doing third grade Math

00:11:48.696 --> 00:11:51.228
and you have one kid doing
Algebra, and that's great.

00:11:51.228 --> 00:11:55.183
The student doing the third grade Math
needs to be doing the third grade Math.

00:11:55.183 --> 00:11:57.180
Here she needs to fill out those gaps,

00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:00.763
and the student who's doing the
Algebra should be able to run forward

00:12:00.763 --> 00:12:02.236
and do the Algebra.

00:12:02.236 --> 00:12:04.040
Then some people say, "Oh this is bad."

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.904
"Already the smart kids
have the advantage"

00:12:05.904 --> 00:12:08.262
"and the slow kids they already
have every disadvantage."

00:12:08.262 --> 00:12:10.218
"Now you're making the spread even wider."

00:12:10.218 --> 00:12:12.796
But what they don't realize
is in these same classes

00:12:12.796 --> 00:12:16.598
it's becoming impossible to
figure out over a longer term

00:12:16.598 --> 00:12:19.096
who those smart kids are
and who the slower kids are.

00:12:19.096 --> 00:12:21.992
Because even though one kid is working
on third grade Math for a little while,

00:12:21.992 --> 00:12:25.429
once he or she has getting those [cuts]
and we see it over and over again,

00:12:25.429 --> 00:12:26.971
they're able to race ahead.

00:12:26.971 --> 00:12:29.741
Then three weeks later they passed
up the kid who is in Algebra.

00:12:29.741 --> 00:12:33.012
All of this kind of
labels start to disappear.

00:12:33.012 --> 00:12:40.749
The other thing that we're kind of
thinking about as we grow our organization

00:12:40.749 --> 00:12:44.541
and we really want to make sure we have
a good hold on it is why is it working,

00:12:44.541 --> 00:12:45.817
why is it resonating?

00:12:45.817 --> 00:12:50.209
These ideas heave existed forever on
demand videos, self-paced learning.

00:12:52.454 --> 00:12:55.742
The real data points we've been getting
obviously we've had the user growth,

00:12:55.742 --> 00:12:58.178
we've had the traction,
Bill Gates uses it.

00:12:58.178 --> 00:13:02.416
(audience laughing)

00:13:02.416 --> 00:13:07.960
For me personally the real data points
has just been the user testimonies,

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:08.997
the letters that we get

00:13:08.997 --> 00:13:11.594
and actually the first feedback just
turned into a little bit of a one liner

00:13:11.594 --> 00:13:13.336
was for my cousins ...

00:13:13.336 --> 00:13:17.039
Their very first feedback when I
put 20 or 30 videos up for them,

00:13:17.039 --> 00:13:20.164
they said that they preferred
me on YouTube than in person.

00:13:20.164 --> 00:13:23.404
(audience laughing)

00:13:24.373 --> 00:13:28.061
We just keep getting them and I
think there's a common theme here

00:13:28.061 --> 00:13:29.895
and I'll just read a couple real quick.

00:13:29.895 --> 00:13:32.844
There's one, "My eldest kid is
dancing around in my room here"

00:13:32.844 --> 00:13:34.783
"because she is so excited
that she finally found someone"

00:13:34.783 --> 00:13:36.401
"that teaches like this."

00:13:36.401 --> 00:13:41.021
I feel uncomfortable, I don't like doing
the self praise, I mean I don't ...

00:13:41.021 --> 00:13:47.160
But what's cool here is that
this girl she wasn't just happy.

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.778
When she learned something,

00:13:48.778 --> 00:13:50.640
when she was actually able
to connect with the material

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:52.356
it wasn't like "Oh I'm
going to nail the exam."

00:13:52.356 --> 00:13:55.597
She felt the visceral desire to dance.

00:13:55.597 --> 00:13:58.303
(audience laughing)

00:13:58.303 --> 00:14:05.973
(applauding)

00:14:05.973 --> 00:14:07.971
There's all sorts of ... this is a letter

00:14:07.971 --> 00:14:11.504
and this takes me back to my college
days when I didn't have a girlfriend.

00:14:11.504 --> 00:14:15.119
I don't know if these boys at
Bellarmine can relate to this comment.

00:14:15.119 --> 00:14:16.969
(audience laughing)

00:14:16.969 --> 00:14:19.097
This is a comment from a college student,

00:14:19.097 --> 00:14:21.886
"There's always so much else that
a student has on their mind."

00:14:21.886 --> 00:14:23.799
"What is a pretty girl
looking like today?"

00:14:23.799 --> 00:14:26.079
"What was the professor like
when they were a student?"

00:14:26.079 --> 00:14:28.121
"Should I talk to the
pretty girl after class?"

00:14:28.121 --> 00:14:31.251
"Will I include last weekends
event in a book about my life?"

00:14:31.251 --> 00:14:33.361
"That the slightest drifting of focus"

00:14:33.361 --> 00:14:36.497
"quickly turns into a fruitless two
hours spent daydreaming or unconscious."

00:14:36.497 --> 00:14:38.983
"Please continue what you are doing."

00:14:38.983 --> 00:14:41.309
(audience laughing)

00:14:41.309 --> 00:14:45.099
(applauding)

00:14:45.099 --> 00:14:47.974
It was actually a much longer
letter that I had to reduct,

00:14:47.974 --> 00:14:50.466
it wasn't appropriate for this audience.

00:14:50.466 --> 00:14:52.269
(audience laughing)

00:14:52.269 --> 00:14:56.519
This is what I got two days ago,
"I've taken Calculus 1 three times."

00:14:56.519 --> 00:14:58.072
"The first time I didn't pass the class,"

00:14:58.072 --> 00:14:59.630
"the second time I had to drop the class."

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:02.268
"My girlfriend's mom
told me about the site,"

00:15:02.268 --> 00:15:04.211
"she heard about it in a
conference, I checked it out."

00:15:04.211 --> 00:15:07.013
"I began supplementing, proceeding and
sometimes even replacing my lectures"

00:15:07.013 --> 00:15:10.507
"with your videos and I received
an 84% on my first midterm."

00:15:10.507 --> 00:15:12.250
This is the third time he's taking it.

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:14.590
"I almost cried, I was so happy."

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:18.667
When I first try, it's 84 that's
a good score, why's he crying?

00:15:18.667 --> 00:15:22.779
"Especially because the
class average was a 47%."

00:15:22.779 --> 00:15:30.370
(applauding)

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:31.796
"Now the second midterm is coming up,"

00:15:31.796 --> 00:15:34.551
"I feel confident enough to say that I
will most likely get an A in the class."

00:15:34.551 --> 00:15:36.631
"Since my major depends
on me passing the class,"

00:15:36.631 --> 00:15:39.165
"I want to thank you for helping
me save my college career."

00:15:40.334 --> 00:15:44.553
It's pretty a mind blowing stuff

00:15:44.553 --> 00:15:48.598
and I think you can imagine why I quit
my day job as a hedge fund manager.

00:15:48.598 --> 00:15:51.258
Wasn't quite as much psychic reward.

00:15:51.258 --> 00:15:57.322
(applauding)

00:15:57.322 --> 00:15:59.639
I think the take away here is that ...

00:15:59.639 --> 00:16:02.885
and this is the learning that we never
want to forget as an organization

00:16:02.885 --> 00:16:07.821
is that, people come to the Khan
Academy wanting to just fill in the gap.

00:16:07.821 --> 00:16:09.552
They have an exam, they
want to pass an exam,

00:16:09.552 --> 00:16:12.210
but once they actually experience
what it's like to learn,

00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:13.603
it doesn't matter who they are.

00:16:13.603 --> 00:16:15.343
It could be the student
who's about to drop out.

00:16:15.343 --> 00:16:17.807
Once they actually experience
it for the first time in life

00:16:17.807 --> 00:16:19.144
they get addicted.

00:16:19.144 --> 00:16:24.230
It's a natural high, it's something that
we innately, all humans want to have.

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:26.305
That's something as an organization,
we don't want to ever forget.

00:16:26.305 --> 00:16:28.845
That if we can form these
human bonds using technology,

00:16:28.845 --> 00:16:31.249
that's what's actually going
to allow us to succeed.

00:16:31.249 --> 00:16:35.026
I want to leave you with
one quick little story

00:16:35.026 --> 00:16:39.393
from one of the Los Altos classrooms last
week that kind of hits the point home.

00:16:39.393 --> 00:16:42.091
There was a reporter
from NBC doing a story

00:16:42.091 --> 00:16:44.595
on what we're doing in that classroom.

00:16:44.595 --> 00:16:48.546
And there's a little fifth grader
and she's doing trigonometry

00:16:48.546 --> 00:16:50.973
and actually all of the
boys are very envious of her

00:16:50.973 --> 00:16:53.345
because she has the most badges and
points and all of that other things.

00:16:53.345 --> 00:16:56.228
The reporter sits down
next to her and says,

00:16:56.228 --> 00:16:58.724
"Do you think this is fifth grade Math?"

00:16:58.724 --> 00:17:01.880
Then the little girl has a mischievous
smile and she looks at the reporter

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:04.575
and she goes, "No, I
think it's sixth grade."

00:17:04.575 --> 00:17:06.596
(audience laughing)

00:17:06.596 --> 00:17:07.462
Thank you.

00:17:07.462 --> 00:17:15.210
(applauding)
