00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.300
So let's take a look at the current state of our pp.

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.340
When I click on this microphone button, the label and

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.110
the Stop button, they start to show up correctly.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.310
That's good.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.320
Now, I haven't quite recorded any audio yet, and

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.550
I plan to do that in the next lesson.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.370
For now, I want to move on to a new screen,

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.280
when I click on the Stop button over here.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.270
On this new screen there will be a few buttons that will let

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.140
me play a famous movie quote.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.290
Let's add this new screen to an app next.
