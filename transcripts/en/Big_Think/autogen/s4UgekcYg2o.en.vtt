from those cities and so we would have

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430
from those cities and so we would have
 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.430
from those cities and so we would have
to build secondary infrastructures we

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440
to build secondary infrastructures we
 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.320
to build secondary infrastructures we
would have to move to higher elevations

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.330
would have to move to higher elevations
 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.100
would have to move to higher elevations
in fact and so the irony of becoming a

when sea levels rise is that this may be

when sea levels rise is that this may be

when sea levels rise is that this may be
the worst time for us to be doing that

the worst time for us to be doing that
 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.340
the worst time for us to be doing that
because of the climate change and this

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:04.350
because of the climate change and this
 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:05.990
because of the climate change and this
and the sea levels rise that we have

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.450
and the sea levels rise that we have
brought about
