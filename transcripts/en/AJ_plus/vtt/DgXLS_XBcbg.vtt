00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
What happens when you spend most of your
life doing a job only to see it disappear?

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.460
"I'm from the generation from where hard

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.600
work should pay off and I said that was
the least that they owed us because they were

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.420
all still making money." What happens when
one of your town's largest financial contributors leaves?

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.460
This is the story of
how one company's failure impacted

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.280
people, places, and a nation.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.300
When Toys "R" Us said it was closing all its U.S. stores,

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.520
it didn't just mean the end of an iconic
brand, it was also the end of thousands

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.500
of jobs and millions in tax revenue. The
losers in this case, of course in the

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.880
first instance, are the workers. They've
lost their jobs and they're being denied

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.420
severance. Hey fam. I'm Imaeyen and this
Sunday we're telling you how one retail

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.740
giant collapsed and why we might be
seeing a lot more stores following in

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.080
its footsteps. Spoiler alert. It's not
just Amazon's fault.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.380
Wall Street's involved too.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.200
So yeah, it's kind of funny that uh, that's how much

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.080
help I needed. (Laughs) That’s how bad it was. That’s the finished product so I'm proud of that one.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.200
This is the first time Ann-Marie Reinhart has ever had to do a

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.300
resume. When she began working at Toys "R" Us 29 years ago, she didn't need one.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.680
When I first sat down to do the resume I was like, “Alright, you know I’ve done this.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:35.100
and I was just jotting those one or two words down. I had someone look at it from the Department of Labor,

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.100
she went, “Ooooh", it was not so good.” (giggles)

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.300
Reinhart spent the first 25 years of her
time at Toys "R" Us in New York, before she

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.080
moved to North Carolina. She thought
she'd retire from Toys "R" Us.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.840
She thought that even as she saw signs
of its financial difficulties and its

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.600
restructuring. She thought that even
after the company tried to reassure

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.020
employees. "I don't want to get too
emotional because when I really start

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.460
talking about it... I guess...

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.360
Can you give me napkins? I feel it
coming on. In September they had filed

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.820
for Chapter 11. Obviously, you know, that
was a red flag for all of us. Then Dave

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:19.820
Brandon sent a letter to everyone in the
country stating, you know, nobody

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.720
to be alarmed, everything's gonna be fine.
We're just restructuring this loan."

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.960
Everything would not be fine for
Toys "R" Us. Reinhardt is one of 33,000

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.000
employees who lost a job when Toys "R" Us went bankrupt. Her store in Durham shut

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.420
down in the first wave of closures in
February. The last doors closed shop at

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.720
the end of June. "I'm starting to get
scared. I'm not gonna lie. I'm starting to

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.240
get scared because I've been looking for
a job and unemployment runs out in about

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.160
four weeks." The store's road from
profitability to bankruptcy is the tale

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.540
of what can happen when Wall Street
steps in to try and turn a company

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.660
around. Economist Eileen Applebaum says
when private equity buys retailers like

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.080
Toys "R" Us, often the investors win while
the company and its employees suffer.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.980
"When private equity owns the company and
sells off the real estate, the company

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.640
does not get the money. The money goes
directly to the private equity firm and

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:22.240
its investors. There's nothing in it for
them. For the, for the retail company and

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.960
this makes no sense from the perspective
of having a strong business. It only

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.100
makes sense from the point of view of
the private equity firms." See even if a

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.620
company like Toys "R" Us goes bankrupt, the private equity firms still make money

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.820
through things like charging millions
in fees to the retailer, or selling off

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.080
all the company's real estate. Toys "R" Us
was actually turning a profit when it

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.680
filed for bankruptcy. How profitable was
it? It was responsible for one out of

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.880
every five toys sold in the U.S. in 2017.
But the retailer was saddled with

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.300
millions of dollars in debt thanks to
the private equity firms that bought it --

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.720
too much debt for its profits to make a
difference. "The interest expenses alone

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.040
were four hundred million dollars a year.
So, if you're paying a four hundred

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.780
million dollars a year in just interest
expenses, not to mention that you're also

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.120
paying rent, not to mention that you're
also paying these advisory fees,

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.640
there's not a whole lot left to invest in the company." Private equity firms

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.960
found Toys "R" Us enticing in 2005,
even though competitors like Wal-Mart

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.300
were already putting the squeeze on the
company. That's when Bain Capital, KKR &amp;

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.220
Company, and Vernado Realty Trust bought the toy retailer. What often happens with

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.120
private equity is that they say their
goals are to invest money, cut costs, and

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.760
improve efficiency, and all while trying
to maximize profits. Private equity makes

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.580
its money if it boosts the company's
perceived value and then sells it. And

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.760
the majority of the dollars and cents
they're using in this game aren't even

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.500
their own. The companies who are owned by
private equity firms are at risk of

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.520
bankruptcy if they can't pay off their
debt. "The private equity firm puts in a

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.900
little bit of money to that fund, very
little. And the pension funds and other

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.720
investors put up the rest.
So they're basically playing with other

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.580
people's money. The private equity firm
puts in one or two dollars for every

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.740
hundred that the investors put in. So the
private equity firms have very little

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.160
skin in the game, very little that they
can lose." Companies like Bain Capital

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.860
helped save stores like Burlington Coat
Factory, Dollar General, and Restoration

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.700
Hardware. And they've made plenty of
money in the process. But for every

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:32.000
Burlington, there's a Sports Authority, a
Gymboree, a Payless, and a Toys "R" Us.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.460
"Yeah, they took the letters off the building.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:41.000
Oh my goodness. Wow."

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.020
Those are just a few of the
retailers that went bankrupt in 2016 and

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:51.260
2017. PE-owned businesses are accounting
for an increasing share of Chapter 11

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:55.360
bankruptcies. Part of why we're
seeing these companies go bust right now

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.620
is because of over investment in
property during the mid-2000s. Large

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.280
big-box stores kept going up, as did
property values. Many considered

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:09.040
purchasing big-box retail space as savvy
investment at the time. The bet didn't

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:13.920
pay off, and the effect of the so-called
retail apocalypse has been widespread.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:17.680
Overall retail employment has been
falling. You've probably seen your local

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:22.180
mall with a few empty storefronts.
Department stores like Macy's and JC

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:28.140
Penney shed nearly a hundred thousand
jobs between October 2016 and April 2017.

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:32.740
That's more than the total number of
coal miners or steel workers we so often

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:37.760
hear President Trump talk about. The
retail problem is impacting every region.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.560
The nation's richest cities are also
seeing retail struggle. New York City had

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:46.060
three years of falling employment at
clothing stores as of 2017. A streak like

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:52.140
that hasn't happened since the early
1990s. When stores disappear, jobs vanish,

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:56.520
and so does the money those companies
contribute to local economies. "People

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:01.260
came to downtown in a small town because
they were going to go shopping for toys

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.880
and while they were there they visited
the other stores as well. And the same

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:10.440
thing is true of malls. These malls and
main streets are losing a major anchor

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:16.820
store. So communities suffer. Lenders
suffer. Vendors suffer, and worst of all

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:21.620
the employees suffer." Now, some of those
laid off retail workers, like Reinhart,

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:27.960
are fighting just to get severance. "Now,
is the end of February, the end of March,

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:31.640
we're about halfway through our
liquidation, still not no word on what

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:36.000
the severance package was. And that's
when we found out that we were not

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.800
getting any severance. And we found out, via a phone call."

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.320
"This is a company that traditionally paid severance

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:45.000
all the way up to 2016. The year before the

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.540
bankruptcy, they were still paying
severance when they laid off workers and

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:52.180
now they've refused to do that."
Toys "R" Us is headquartered in Wayne, New

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:56.680
Jersey. It paid more than $2.7 million to the town on its property in

00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:02.040
taxes last year. The former toy giant is
Wayne's third largest taxpayer, according

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:09.100
to Moody's. Wayne is now out exactly 1,159
jobs, which is the equivalent to 2

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:14.540
percent of its population and millions
in taxes to fund town services. When

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:18.720
Toys "R" Us leaves, the lot it sits on
will decrease in value if it's vacant

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:24.460
for too long. That's true of all 740 Toys "R" Us stores that's shut down in the U.S.

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:28.900
Right now the future of all those
vacated properties is as unclear as

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:33.900
Reinhart's employment prospects. We don't
know what will happen. The one thing that

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:39.540
is certain is that Reinhart is done
looking for retail work. "I'm definitely

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:43.120
not looking to go back into retail. It
did leave a little bit of a bad taste in

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:47.560
my mouth. I never ever dreamed at my age,
that I would be out there

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:54.580
needing, and looking for a job. So that part gets a
little emotional."
