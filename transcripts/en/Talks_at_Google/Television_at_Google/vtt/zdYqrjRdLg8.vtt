KEVIN DUNCAN: Hello everyone.

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.640
Welcome to Talks at Google.

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:03.390
I'm Kevin Duncan.

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.210
Today we welcome the
cast of "Fuller House."

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.630
So who we have is Candace
Cameron-Bure, Jodie Sweetin,

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:10.460
and Andrew Barber.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.710

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:13.460
JODIE SWEETIN: Hi.

00:00:15.571 --> 00:00:17.946
KEVIN DUNCAN: We've got the
awesome '90s plaid couch here

00:00:17.946 --> 00:00:18.640
for you guys.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.670
JODIE SWEETIN: Oh, fantastic.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:20.470
KEVIN DUNCAN: Look at that.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.250
JODIE SWEETIN: We only
sit on '90s couches.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:23.708
KEVIN DUNCAN: That's
what we heard.

00:00:23.708 --> 00:00:26.310
We had it shipped in from
LA-- San Francisco, excuse me.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.670
So welcome guys.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:28.460
Welcome to Google.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.740
JODIE SWEETIN: Thank you.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:29.020
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE: Thank you

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.061
ANDREA BARBER: Thank you.

00:00:30.061 --> 00:00:32.800
KEVIN DUNCAN: So you guys
are back after 21 years

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.200
since you guys went off
the air, and so the show

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.529
takes place 29 years.

00:00:36.529 --> 00:00:38.820
That said, I love kind of
the intro how they went right

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:39.110
into it that.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:40.820
So can you just tell
us what you three

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.860
are up to after 29 years later.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.660
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE:
Well, DJ sadly is widowed,

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.510
and-- but she has three kids
and she's a veterinarian.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.270
And is that we're talking about?

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:54.230
The characters right?

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.472
It's been a long day.

00:00:56.472 --> 00:00:57.770
I've got to pee.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:58.830
I've been up since 4:00.

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:00.940
JODIE SWEETIN: What have you
been doing like 29 years there?

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:01.992
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE: I know.

00:01:01.992 --> 00:01:03.366
JODIE SWEETIN:
I'm on "The View."

00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:05.524
Wow, that's really strange.

00:01:05.524 --> 00:01:06.190
Do you need me--

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.106
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE:
I'm setting a great tone

00:01:08.106 --> 00:01:09.460
for this interview.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.175
So sorry.

00:01:11.175 --> 00:01:13.550
JODIE SWEETIN: I'll be her
interpreter today and I will--

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:14.883
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE: Thank you.

00:01:14.883 --> 00:01:16.439
JODIE SWEETIN: Yes.

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.980
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE:
Yes, so then so

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.520
DJ, that's where she is.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.760
She's a single mom raising
three kids and a working mom,

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.440
gets overwhelmed so she invites
her best friend and her sister,

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.090
or kind of.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.890
She doesn't invite.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.098
JODIE SWEETIN: Well yeah,
Stephanie, the whole family

00:01:31.098 --> 00:01:34.170
is back because Danny is talking
about selling the house, which

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.100
is why the original
house is in the show.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.516
Everyone gets to
see that, which I

00:01:37.516 --> 00:01:40.060
think is as much of a
character as anybody else.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.680
And they're all there
and Steph, she really

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.630
sees her sister struggling,
and overwhelmed,

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:47.800
and needing some help.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.800
And so she kind of gives
up everything and says,

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.050
I'm going to move in with you.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.332
And then Kimmy decides
to move in as well and--

00:01:53.332 --> 00:01:55.540
KEVIN DUNCAN: I was going
to say she invited herself.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.780
I saw--

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:56.360
JODIE SWEETIN: Yeah, she--

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.200
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.908
JODIE SWEETIN: --in
typical Gibbler style

00:01:58.908 --> 00:02:00.339
she invites herself.

00:02:00.339 --> 00:02:01.380
ANDREA BARBER: Uninvited.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.960
JODIE SWEETIN: And the frenemy
of relationship continues.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.002
ANDREA BARBER: Yes, yeah.

00:02:05.002 --> 00:02:07.085
KEVIN DUNCAN: I got to see
the first few episodes,

00:02:07.085 --> 00:02:08.840
and the first episode
was-- really it just

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.820
seemed like a mirror image
of the first one with you

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.945
three guys in the lead, or
three girls in the lead.

00:02:12.945 --> 00:02:14.990
And so can you
talk about the idea

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.850
of-- because it's
pretty much a reunion,

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.650
but also taking kind of
hey, this is where we were,

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.460
and then this is
where we're going.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.626
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE: Yeah,
the pilot episode really

00:02:23.626 --> 00:02:24.780
is an ode to all the fans.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.730
It's saying here we are.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.420
We're back together, and
we're giving you everything

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.130
we think you're hoping for.

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.170
And it's setting up the premise
for what the new show is about,

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.110
which is really about us three
women raising these four kids.

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.880
So if you haven't heard
already, the original cast

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.470
is together for
the first episode.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:50.500
And then the other characters,
Danny, Jessie, Joey, and Becky,

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.314
they pop in and out for some
episodes throughout the series.

00:02:56.314 --> 00:02:58.480
But they're not in every
one, because it's revolving

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.630
around this new family.

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:00.804
But that--

00:03:00.804 --> 00:03:02.220
JODIE SWEETIN: I
think we realized

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.390
that we needed to do
that reunion moment,

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.350
that people were really
excited for that,

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.590
but that "Fuller
House" is a show that

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.200
is about much more than that.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.900
But we had to get
it out of the way

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.500
so that everyone wouldn't
be like, what happened?

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.110
We wanted to see
everybody together.

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.050
So we did that.

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.237
We gave that to everybody
and then continued on

00:03:20.237 --> 00:03:21.070
with the new series.

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.680
KEVIN DUNCAN: Well, it was
great because the first episode

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.520
happened and I was like,
oh this is very familiar

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.640
and it's great to
see all you guys.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.550
And then it was literally
the second episode you guys,

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:28.790
it was really
different, actually,

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.831
because it actually went
in different directions.

00:03:30.831 --> 00:03:33.260
And Andrea I love--
we all love Kimmy.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.430
We all love Kimmy.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:35.263
JODIE SWEETIN: Yeah.

00:03:35.263 --> 00:03:35.970
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.190
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE:
We love Kimmy.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.800
ANDREA BARBER: I love Kimmy.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.680
KEVIN DUNCAN: And
I love the fact

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.650
that-- it was so fun because
I just remember Kimmy always

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.430
being there, but I
actually watching back

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.805
in the first few
seasons prepping

00:03:43.805 --> 00:03:46.340
for this, Kimmy's character
was just kind of this side

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.070
character and popped
in and out, and then

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:49.736
got more and more in
the later episodes.

00:03:49.736 --> 00:03:51.891
So to have you now
as a leading-- one

00:03:51.891 --> 00:03:53.140
of the leading ladies in this.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.840
This is fantastic.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:54.340
ANDREA BARBER: It's thrilling.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.340
It's overwhelming.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.595
And Kimmy is so excited to
finally move inside the house.

00:04:00.595 --> 00:04:03.580
It was her childhood home,
too, even though nobody really

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:04.400
wanted her there.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.920
But she's finally home
and it's exciting,

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.894
and it's so cool to be
here with these women.

00:04:10.894 --> 00:04:12.560
We're just having
such a blast together.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.185
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE:
It was hysterical

00:04:14.185 --> 00:04:19.579
because-- I mean we've
been acting since the show.

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.311
Andrea retired from acting
right after the show.

00:04:23.311 --> 00:04:25.060
And then we get on the
set and we're like,

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.720
oh, we get to revive
these characters.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.310
And you kind of wonder,
how's it going to be.

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.484
And Andrea literally,
she gets on the set

00:04:32.484 --> 00:04:33.900
and she gets a
script in her hand,

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.380
and she just like morphs
into Kimmy Gibbler,

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.140
like without missing a beat.

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.840
It was, it's-- I love it.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:40.250
JODIE SWEETIN: It
was hysterical, yeah.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.880
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE: I love it.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.213
ANDREA BARBER: Kimmy Gibbler
has been hibernating inside

00:04:43.213 --> 00:04:45.090
of me for the last 20
years, and I finally

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.000
get to unleash her to the world.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.500
It's great.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:49.560
JODIE SWEETIN: I mean
she's hysterical.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.279
It's every time Kimmy is on
screen I just-- I die laughing.

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:54.570
KEVIN DUNCAN: Well, your
backstory is very interesting,

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.278
because you have an
estranged husband who

00:04:56.278 --> 00:04:58.280
pops into the episodes
here and there.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.630
But were there any
other ideas in terms

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.390
of what her backstory
was going to be

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:03.000
and what she was
going to be doing?

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.940
Because you're an
entrepreneur, you're

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:04.980
an event planner in the--

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.063
ANDREA BARBER: Yeah, Kimmy
is now a party planner.

00:05:07.063 --> 00:05:10.410
s she takes her
parties very seriously.

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.020
But yeah, Jeff Franklin, our
creator and executive producer,

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.660
he and I talked a
lot about what--

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.910
who is modern Kimmy Gibbler now?

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:20.530
And one of the ideas
we threw around

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.210
was maybe she should be an
interpreter for the United

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.630
Nations, and so she comes in
speaking all these languages.

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.249
And everyone's like,
where did that come from.

00:05:27.249 --> 00:05:28.790
But we finally
settled on-- you know,

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.331
you've got to stay true to the
original eccentric characters.

00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:33.450
So she's a party planner.

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:34.550
She's still zany.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.210
She's still living in the
'90s, but she's a modern woman.

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.680
She's a single mom and
she's helping out DJ,

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.942
but DJ and Stephanie are
helping out her, too.

00:05:41.942 --> 00:05:43.900
JODIE SWEETIN: She plans
great parties, though.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.397
There's several parties in the
first season of "Fuller House"

00:05:47.397 --> 00:05:48.980
and they're all
Gibbler-style parties.

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:50.829
KEVIN DUNCAN: And
you're also a DJ?

00:05:50.829 --> 00:05:51.870
JODIE SWEETIN: I am a DJ.

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.370
I am DJ Tanner.

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.036
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE:
She stole my name.

00:05:55.036 --> 00:05:56.095
Who does that?

00:05:56.095 --> 00:05:57.220
KEVIN DUNCAN: It's awesome.

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:57.852
I love that.

00:05:57.852 --> 00:05:59.060
JODIE SWEETIN: I'm DJ Tanner.

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.560
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE:
It's so wrong.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.520
JODIE SWEETIN: It's
kind of awesome.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.186
KEVIN DUNCAN: So
that's your career now?

00:06:04.186 --> 00:06:06.509
JODIE SWEETIN: Yeah,
Steph has been a DJ.

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:07.800
She's been traveling the world.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:13.310
She's been living sort of an
unattached-- not irresponsible,

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.290
but not really a
tied down lifestyle.

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:18.380
And she comes home.

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:19.297
And she was in London.

00:06:19.297 --> 00:06:20.879
Didn't think she was
going to make it,

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:23.180
and she comes home and
decides that she really needs

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:24.305
to be there for her sister.

00:06:24.305 --> 00:06:28.656
But Steph's character
has been having--

00:06:28.656 --> 00:06:29.544
KEVIN DUNCAN: Kimmy.

00:06:29.544 --> 00:06:32.660
ANDREA BARBER: That was
Dave Coulier farting off--

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.502
Don't mind that.

00:06:34.502 --> 00:06:35.710
JODIE SWEETIN: What happened?

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:37.543
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE:
You guys have no idea.

00:06:37.543 --> 00:06:39.829
Who is that? [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:39.829 --> 00:06:41.120
JODIE SWEETIN: What's going on?

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:41.560
Is someone--

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:42.881
CANDACE CAMERON BURE: It's
starting to turn into a beat.

00:06:42.881 --> 00:06:43.763
JODIE SWEETIN: Right?

00:06:43.763 --> 00:06:46.090
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE: DJ
Tanner, drop the beat.

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:47.631
KEVIN DUNCAN: Come
on, drop the beat.

00:06:47.631 --> 00:06:48.840
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:49.530
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE:
Is it mine?

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:50.925
KEVIN DUNCAN: It's Candace.

00:06:50.925 --> 00:06:54.107
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE:
Should I turn this off then?

00:06:54.107 --> 00:06:55.190
KEVIN DUNCAN: There we go.

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:56.290
JODIE SWEETIN: There you
go, just yank it off.

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:57.052
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE:
All righty, we'll

00:06:57.052 --> 00:06:57.950
put it right here.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:58.155
KEVIN DUNCAN: I'll take that.

00:06:58.155 --> 00:06:58.280
There we go.

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.488
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE: I'll
hide it behind the pillow.

00:07:00.488 --> 00:07:04.330
KEVIN DUNCAN:
Google, technology.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:05.830
JODIE SWEETIN: Yeah,
you guys really

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:07.340
should work on that
aspect of your--

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:08.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:10.054
KEVIN DUNCAN: And
so you were saying.

00:07:10.054 --> 00:07:11.720
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE:
What was I saying?

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:12.110
KEVIN DUNCAN: I'm
not sure anymore.

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:12.310
JODIE SWEETIN: I was saying.

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:12.580
You interrupted.

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:13.450
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:15.600
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE:
Sorry, whack-a-mole.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:16.700
OK.

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.060
JODIE SWEETIN: Oh,
it's been a long day.

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:21.610
No, Stephanie, yeah, she's
been having a lot of fun.

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:23.481
And so she comes
back and really steps

00:07:23.481 --> 00:07:25.230
into a position of
helping her sister out.

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:29.160
And it's great because Stephanie
gets to kind of transform

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:33.570
in those first few episodes to
this person who doesn't really

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:36.790
want to be grounded anywhere to
showing back up for her sister.

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:41.070
And then Steph and Kimmy
have this amazing frenemy

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:44.330
relationship, where they sort
of battle but love each other

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.771
and really-- and
Stephanie knows that Kimmy

00:07:46.771 --> 00:07:48.020
has been there for her sister.

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:49.270
And that means a lot to her.

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:50.890
KEVIN DUNCAN: For sure,
and I love how it really

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:52.180
tackles more adult themes.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.076
Because it was
interesting watching that,

00:07:54.076 --> 00:07:55.700
too, while obviously
you guys were kids

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:56.783
and you had no storylines.

00:07:56.783 --> 00:07:59.530
But was it interesting
and fun, and what

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:02.310
was the process of coming
up with adult storylines?

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:04.660
Were you guys influencing
that with your real life,

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:06.139
or what was that process?

00:08:06.139 --> 00:08:07.930
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE:
Well, all three of us

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:09.270
are moms in real life.

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:12.370
And so we did meet
with all of the writers

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:15.550
and we're talking about
our parenting styles

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:17.549
and giving them stories
out of our real life

00:08:17.549 --> 00:08:18.340
that have happened.

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:22.770
So I know they've plucked things
from that to also form them

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:24.530
into our characters.

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:28.870
That's a fun aspect of the
show is that the three of us,

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:31.980
as our characters,
parent very differently.

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:34.169
And so we fill in the gaps.

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:35.900
Where there's a
weakness, there's

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:38.700
a strength from another.

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:42.570
But as far as being the
adults on the show and all

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:44.520
those storylines, I
mean I think we're

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:47.870
just happy we don't have to
go to school on our breaks

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:49.580
like when we were kids.

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:51.870
I mean it's fun to
drive the show this time

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:53.470
as the women and not the kids.

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:56.080
But we love working with
the new kids on the show

00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:00.470
and it gives them this-- we
have the most unique perspective

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:04.750
in that sense, that we can give
to them everything that we've

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:06.240
already gone through.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:10.350
And at the same time,
not only teach them,

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:13.970
but we can also say, hey,
stop complaining because we've

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:15.310
already done this too.

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:17.470
We understand and we get it.

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:19.930
KEVIN DUNCAN: And so you
guys are on Netflix now,

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:21.180
which is phenomenal.

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:24.109
And Stamos seemed to be the guy
who was pushing for this a lot

00:09:24.109 --> 00:09:25.400
and always bringing it back up.

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.790
And he's a producer I think
on the series as well.

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:30.740
So has it been-- it's
great to see it on Netflix

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:32.740
and has it been also
different in that you don't

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:34.531
have to really be in
the network guidelines

00:09:34.531 --> 00:09:37.040
and you don't have to adhere
to 22 minutes and stuff.

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:38.750
And has that changed
too much or--

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:40.250
JODIE SWEETIN: Yeah,
I mean, I think

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:44.250
it's this is sort of uncharted
territory for us as far as

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:50.290
how to do a sitcom within a
much looser framework, which

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:52.740
is a real benefit
to being on Netflix.

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:55.210
We can make the shows
a little bit longer.

00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:57.942
So if it's 26 minutes, it's
like, all right that's fine.

00:09:57.942 --> 00:09:59.900
We don't have to panic
and cut a bunch of stuff

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:01.960
that we think is really good.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:04.940
We're not beholden
to finding out

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:06.900
what our ratings are
every week and panicking

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:09.840
if something goes up or down.

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.720
And it gives us a lot
of freedom to really

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:14.260
be able to do a show that the
fans love and the fans want.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.730
And I think that that was why
this has been so immensely

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:21.580
popular and why it
had such a success

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:24.652
at coming back in the first
place is that the fans love it.

00:10:24.652 --> 00:10:26.860
ANDREA BARBER: It's a great
partnership with Netflix,

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:29.230
too, because of the
way "Full House" fans

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:33.130
watch "Full House." "Full House"
has never been off the air

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:34.630
in 30 years.

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:38.985
And it's on 4, 5, 6, 7 times
every night at Nick at Night,

00:10:38.985 --> 00:10:41.010
so people have already
been binge watching

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:42.960
"Full House" for a long time.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.990
And so when it's
released tomorrow

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:50.720
at 12:01 AM on Netflix, you
can just have an all-nighter.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:54.550
You can watch every episode
you want, just all in a row.

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:57.300
Or you can space them out if
you want to savor each episode.

00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:59.050
KEVIN DUNCAN: And you guys
have so many characters

00:10:59.050 --> 00:10:59.674
that come back.

00:10:59.674 --> 00:11:03.020
Steve is back for the first
episode, and obviously

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:05.430
Bob Saget and everyone.

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:07.890
And so was there a character
from the old show that you

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:11.046
wanted to bring back
and you couldn't?

00:11:11.046 --> 00:11:13.490
JODIE SWEETIN: I want to
bring back Gia, who was--

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:16.080
KEVIN DUNCAN: That was actually
a social media question.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.400
JODIE SWEETIN: Yeah, I
want to bring her back.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.010
And there's been
discussions about it,

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:21.400
so we'll see what happens.

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:21.810
KEVIN DUNCAN: Season 2.

00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:22.643
JODIE SWEETIN: Yeah.

00:11:22.643 --> 00:11:25.370
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE: Wasn't she
a really bad influence on you?

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:28.470
Why do you want to bring
her back, Stephanie?

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:30.610
Making more bad decisions.

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:32.860
JODIE SWEETIN: You haven't
been a part of my life, DJ.

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:35.600
You don't know what's going on.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:38.130
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE: Only
because you stayed away.

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:39.310
JODIE SWEETIN: [SIGHS]
We've had this talk before.

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:40.394
We're not doing it here.

00:11:40.394 --> 00:11:41.560
We're not doing it here, DJ.

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:43.790
CANDACE CAMERON BURE: Are
we taking this too far?

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:45.094
KEVIN DUNCAN: You're
being very rude.

00:11:45.094 --> 00:11:45.900
JODIE SWEETIN: Yeah.

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:48.191
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE: I think
do we collectively want--

00:11:48.191 --> 00:11:49.370
BOTH: Kathy Santoni.

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:51.786
ANDREA BARBER: I want to know
if she's still throwing pool

00:11:51.786 --> 00:11:53.270
parties with her big boobs.

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:54.720
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE: She's
like the girl when you go back

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:56.300
to your high school
reunion and you

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:59.030
want to see if she's
still all that that she

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:02.430
was in high school, or
you can be like ha ha.

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:04.930
KEVIN DUNCAN: And I read you
guys actually brought your kids

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:05.846
back on set and stuff.

00:12:05.846 --> 00:12:08.850
So what was their experience
like seeing their parents back

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:09.642
at it?

00:12:09.642 --> 00:12:11.100
JODIE SWEETIN: My
kids had a blast.

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:12.610
They thought it was really fun.

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:14.730
The first couple tapings
they were super into it,

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:18.000
and then they just wanted to
go hang out in my trailer.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.270
But they, I mean they loved it.

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:22.920
They loved seeing my
"Full House" family

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:25.420
and watching mommy
work and have fun.

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:29.049
And you know my youngest
daughter Beatrix, she's five.

00:12:29.049 --> 00:12:31.590
And that's how old I was when
I started doing the show, which

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:33.860
is just mind-blowing to me
that all this time later I

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:36.420
have my own kids and they
get to be there witnessing

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:38.940
me doing what I love.

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:41.090
KEVIN DUNCAN: Yeah.

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:44.070
What's great about the show as
well, because I mean it does

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:46.640
take off in the second episode
and start becoming different.

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:49.100
But you guys still
keep the same format.

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:50.960
It's the same multi-camera
and everything.

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:52.420
I mean was there any
discussion once you went there,

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:54.860
because everything seems
to be in documentary style

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:55.580
this day and age.

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:57.892
Was there any kind of
pressure or felt like, oh

00:12:57.892 --> 00:12:59.850
maybe we should go to
this or do we really want

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:01.505
to keep it as multi-camera?

00:13:01.505 --> 00:13:02.880
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE:
I only knew

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:07.750
it to be in the original
sitcom for camera style.

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:09.620
Did you hear
anything before that?

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:10.340
JODIE SWEETIN: No, I don't so.

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:12.131
I know there had been
some discussion of it

00:13:12.131 --> 00:13:15.080
back and forth as to
what they wanted to do,

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:17.380
but I know that Netflix
really strongly wanted

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:23.120
to bring this genre
back and reintroduce it

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:25.440
sort of to audiences,
and really make

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:26.940
it popular with
their family viewing

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:27.580
with their multi-camera.

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:28.955
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE:
Yeah, and I

00:13:28.955 --> 00:13:31.030
think it's important
that we're not trying

00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:33.750
to break into something new.

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:39.310
This is a show that people
have loved for 30 years.

00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:43.030
And so if the format was
changed too dramatically,

00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:44.910
people would say this
isn't what I remember.

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:46.800
This isn't even
what I'm wanting.

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.030
So it is for that
fan that I think

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:51.730
a lot of the people
that are wanting

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:55.260
to watch the show again, whether
they were kids or the same ages

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:56.540
as us have grown up.

00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:59.740
They're now maybe they're
parents, maybe you have kids,

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:02.040
and they don't make shows
in that format anymore.

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:04.400
And it's like you
want to go, I want

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.520
to have the same
experience with my child

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:09.040
that I had with my
parents growing up.

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:12.822
And that's why I think it
works in its original format.

00:14:12.822 --> 00:14:13.780
KEVIN DUNCAN: For sure.

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:15.517
And was there any--
what was the toughest

00:14:15.517 --> 00:14:17.350
part or the scariest
part just about getting

00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:21.510
this back together and putting
this on the air online?

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:23.510
ANDREA BARBER: We wanted
to do the legacy proud,

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:26.660
and we didn't want to do
a cheesy reunion movie.

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:29.060
There have been some of
those done in the past.

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:33.520
And we didn't want people
to make fun of this reunion.

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:35.480
So yeah, we wanted
to do it right.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:36.980
We wanted the right
people involved,

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:39.730
so getting Jeff Franklin,
our original creator,

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:43.310
and Bob Boyett, our original
executive producer involved,

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:44.059
was critical.

00:14:44.059 --> 00:14:46.350
And once they were on board
I felt a lot more confident

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:48.558
that this was a show that
was going to be done right.

00:14:48.558 --> 00:14:51.200
It's not just a cheesy
movie, it's not a reboot,

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.780
it's not "Full House 2.0."

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:56.110
It really is a continuation of a
story that started 30 years ago

00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:57.215
when we were little kids.

00:14:57.215 --> 00:14:58.340
KEVIN DUNCAN: That's great.

00:14:58.340 --> 00:14:59.794
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE: Well said.

00:14:59.794 --> 00:15:01.210
KEVIN DUNCAN: We're
going to start

00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:03.001
taking audience questions
in a few minutes,

00:15:03.001 --> 00:15:04.610
if you guys want
to start lining up.

00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:06.443
We do have some questions
from social media,

00:15:06.443 --> 00:15:08.962
though, that we want to get to.

00:15:08.962 --> 00:15:10.170
Some of this is from Twitter.

00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:11.000
Some of this is G+.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.800
Some of this is from
our audience here.

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:17.045
Favorite direct reference to the
old show that we can look for.

00:15:20.722 --> 00:15:22.180
JODIE SWEETIN:
Yeah, there's a lot.

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:26.310
I mean the old
catchphrases are back.

00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:29.360
I think that fans
will be pleasantly

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.860
surprised at the amount
of Easter eggs hidden

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:35.754
throughout the show of reverence
to the original series.

00:15:35.754 --> 00:15:37.920
KEVIN DUNCAN: You brought
back the blue couch I saw.

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:38.660
JODIE SWEETIN: The
original blue couch.

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:40.660
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE: It
really is the original.

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:42.990
It's been in storage, no
joke, and the two blue chairs.

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:43.710
JODIE SWEETIN: The
two blue chairs.

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:45.620
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE:
And so original

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:49.430
that Andrew was allergic to
it and was coughing every time

00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:50.619
she'd be in the living room.

00:15:50.619 --> 00:15:52.910
ANDREA BARBER: I only figured
out after the first week.

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:55.020
I thought how come every time I
have a scene in the living room

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:56.110
I have an asthma attack.

00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:57.402
I can't say my lines like this.

00:15:57.402 --> 00:15:59.443
And Jodie's actually the
one that figured it out.

00:15:59.443 --> 00:16:01.129
She said, you're
allergic to the couch.

00:16:01.129 --> 00:16:02.670
And I walked over
there and sat down,

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:05.120
and I felt this
little puff of dust.

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.810
You know maybe it
was just in my mind.

00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:08.430
But yeah, I was
allergic, so I had

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:11.450
to go out and get it cleaned
organically and everything.

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:12.906
No problems after
that first week.

00:16:12.906 --> 00:16:15.030
KEVIN DUNCAN: But the whole
set was rebuilt, right?

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:16.200
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE: Yes.

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:18.540
From scratch and from
photos because they

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:20.694
lost the original
blueprints of the set.

00:16:20.694 --> 00:16:21.860
Yeah, it was quite the task.

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:23.318
JODIE SWEETIN:
Yeah, like two weeks

00:16:23.318 --> 00:16:25.782
before we got picked up
officially they destroyed

00:16:25.782 --> 00:16:27.240
the blueprints
thinking like, we're

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:29.680
never going to need these.

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:33.962
And then like it was within a
few weeks they went and like,

00:16:33.962 --> 00:16:36.420
oh you know what we need, and
they went and they were like,

00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:38.070
oh we just destroyed those.

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:41.638
So they had to go back and watch
hundreds of hours of footage.

00:16:41.638 --> 00:16:43.310
KEVIN DUNCAN: You
didn't, just them.

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:44.851
JODIE SWEETIN: No,
no, I was actually

00:16:44.851 --> 00:16:49.320
not out there hammering
the set together by myself.

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:52.106
KEVIN DUNCAN: Andrea, where
can we get your bacon and eggs

00:16:52.106 --> 00:16:54.040
scarf and donut purse?

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:55.990
ANDREA BARBER: And I
got that question a lot.

00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:58.132
The show hasn't even
been released yet

00:16:58.132 --> 00:17:00.340
and I'm already getting
questions about Kimmy Gibbler

00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:02.760
accessories, so there might
be a Kimmy Gibbler gift

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:05.200
shop at some point.

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.040
I don't even know.

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:08.126
Our wardrobe stylist
is so fantastic

00:17:08.126 --> 00:17:10.250
and I don't know how she
found all of these things.

00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:12.940
But I hear from fans that
the bacon and egg scarf

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:15.510
is available on Etsy somewhere.

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:19.470
And the donut purse is actually
a Betsey Johnson purse.

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:22.349
And when "Fuller
House" posted some

00:17:22.349 --> 00:17:25.579
of those episodic still photos
of me wearing the donut purse,

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:27.807
Betsey Johnson herself
actually chimed in and was

00:17:27.807 --> 00:17:28.890
like, hey that's my purse.

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:31.040
Thanks, Kimmy, for wearing it.

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:33.170
Yeah, it was pretty cool.

00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:35.760
KEVIN DUNCAN: And DJ, this
was-- at first thing people

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:37.130
were shocked when they
heard that you were going

00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:38.210
to be a widow,
because everyone just

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:39.920
assumed you were with
Steve, but Steve is actually

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:40.900
alive and well.

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:42.587
So why didn't you marry Steve?

00:17:42.587 --> 00:17:44.420
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE:
Well, aren't you happy

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:45.669
I didn't marry Steve?

00:17:45.669 --> 00:17:46.710
Because that would stink.

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:50.290
You'd never see him again.

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:52.106
Or he'd be dead!

00:17:52.106 --> 00:17:53.250
KEVIN DUNCAN: Bad question.

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:54.770
JODIE SWEETIN: Yeah.

00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:56.470
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE:
No, I think

00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:59.230
it gives everyone hope
that I did marry him,

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:01.540
because now he is back.

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:03.120
And yeah, we wanted that.

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:04.650
I don't know.

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:07.220
Well, I do know why--
no, maybe I don't

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:08.610
know why it didn't work out.

00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:09.560
JODIE SWEETIN: I don't
know what you're--

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:10.130
ANDREA BARBER: You
broke up with him.

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:10.750
JODIE SWEETIN: Oh,
why did you do that?

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:12.100
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE: Why
did I break up with him.

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:12.400
JODIE SWEETIN: He
got married first.

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:13.400
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE: Well,
he did get married first,

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:15.108
but I broke up with
him on the mountains.

00:18:15.108 --> 00:18:18.532
DJ just wasn't ready for that
relationship in high school.

00:18:18.532 --> 00:18:20.490
ANDREA BARBER: And he
was moving off to college

00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:22.020
and you guys were going
in separate directions.

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:24.395
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE: They
know much more about DJ's life

00:18:24.395 --> 00:18:25.656
than I do, apparently.

00:18:25.656 --> 00:18:28.102
KEVIN DUNCAN: So we'll take
our first audience question.

00:18:28.102 --> 00:18:29.950
AUDIENCE: Hi, my
name's Lisa, and I just

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:33.033
want to say you all
look so amazingly fit.

00:18:33.033 --> 00:18:34.532
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE:
Oh, thank you.

00:18:34.532 --> 00:18:35.730
ANDREA BARBER: We
like you, Lisa.

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:35.910
Thank you.

00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:37.370
AUDIENCE: And I am so
impressed, and I'm enthusiast.

00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:38.140
So I was wondering--

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:39.340
JODIE SWEETIN: Black pants,
they're really slimming.

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:40.324
It's fantastic.

00:18:40.324 --> 00:18:41.990
AUDIENCE: I mean you
guys must exercise.

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:44.720
And I just wonder what
do you do and how do you

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:48.460
fit it into your
clearly very busy lives?

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:50.260
ANDREA BARBER: You're
the fitness guru so--

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:51.090
JODIE SWEETIN:
You've run marathons.

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:51.923
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:18:51.923 --> 00:18:54.560
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE: I know
and she's a marathon runner.

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:57.410
Tell them how many marathons
and halves you've run.

00:18:57.410 --> 00:18:58.826
ANDREA BARBER: OK,
I just finished

00:18:58.826 --> 00:19:02.752
my fourth full marathon, LA
Marathon like 11 days ago,

00:19:02.752 --> 00:19:04.870
so my feet barely
recovered in time

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:09.241
to put on these heels,
and 25 half marathons.

00:19:09.241 --> 00:19:10.490
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE: Amazing.

00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:13.820
And then I roped her into
a few races, the Spartan

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:15.877
or the Tough Mudder mud runs.

00:19:15.877 --> 00:19:17.460
ANDREA BARBER: Camp
Pendleton Mud Run.

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:19.543
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE: Yeah,
I like strength stuff.

00:19:19.543 --> 00:19:21.370
I workout about
five days a week,

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:23.570
and I travel every single week.

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:25.720
I commute LA to New
York, because I'm

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:27.700
co-hosting "The View"
here in New York,

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:29.320
but my family is in LA.

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:31.720
So it's a struggle,
but I go after work.

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:33.720
We're actually going
to workout at 7 o'clock

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:36.415
tonight, because I just
feel better if I do it.

00:19:36.415 --> 00:19:38.290
JODIE SWEETIN: I'm the
lazy one of the group.

00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:41.770
I only work out like three or
four days a week apparently.

00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:44.180
And I love bacon so yeah.

00:19:47.112 --> 00:19:49.820
AUDIENCE: Hey, so first of
all, thank you for coming.

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:51.688
This is a childhood
dream fulfilled.

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:57.657
Jodie, this question
is for you and it's

00:19:57.657 --> 00:20:00.222
going to be a weird one.

00:20:00.222 --> 00:20:01.430
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE: Try me.

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:02.888
AUDIENCE: My favorite
GIF that I've

00:20:02.888 --> 00:20:07.160
been using for since GIFs
were invented is how rude.

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:11.375
Can we get a
reenactment of how rude?

00:20:11.375 --> 00:20:12.680
JODIE SWEETIN: How rude.

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:15.120
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:17.380
And that's totally
not a weird question,

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:20.430
and that is one that
I get all the time,

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:22.234
which is a huge compliment.

00:20:22.234 --> 00:20:24.400
And the fact that, yeah it
was like the number seven

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:26.290
GIF of 2015.

00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:27.700
I was like score.

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:32.390
I think I've even beat
out Kanye, which yeah,

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:34.102
but I think it was
like misspelled Kanye.

00:20:34.102 --> 00:20:35.060
But still I'll take it.

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:36.500
I'll take it.

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:38.070
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:42.142
AUDIENCE: Hi guys, also
huge dream come true.

00:20:42.142 --> 00:20:44.980
But I wanted to
know, so having known

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:47.510
Danny Tanner as
my childhood life,

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:53.050
and then sort of getting to know
Bob Saget the comedian, very

00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:53.850
different people.

00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:57.540
I wanted to know
as kids on the set,

00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:00.300
like which guy
did you guys know.

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:02.060
ANDREA BARBER: All of the above.

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:03.560
AUDIENCE: But you
were really young.

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:06.506
Like how did that--
I guess as you

00:21:06.506 --> 00:21:08.162
got older did it more come out?

00:21:08.162 --> 00:21:10.020
ANDREA BARBER: Yeah,
Bob reined it in.

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:11.532
The guys reined--
they knew there

00:21:11.532 --> 00:21:13.240
were little kids on
the set, and our moms

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:14.656
were on the set
with us every day.

00:21:14.656 --> 00:21:16.560
By law they were
required to be there.

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:18.976
So the moms every once and a
while would make their rounds

00:21:18.976 --> 00:21:22.025
and be like, OK boys,
let's watch the language.

00:21:22.025 --> 00:21:23.260
The guys did rein it in.

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:24.680
JODIE SWEETIN: I actually
went to the Laugh Factory

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:26.346
with Bob when I was
about nine years old

00:21:26.346 --> 00:21:27.700
and watched him do a set.

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:29.820
I'm not kidding.

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:31.470
Not intentionally,
I was, I would

00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:34.000
spend-- he had three daughters
that I was very close with,

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.132
and as I was spending
the weekend at his house

00:21:36.132 --> 00:21:37.090
and he's like, OK wait.

00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:38.940
Hold on, we've got
to-- I'm doing a set.

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:40.470
I'm like, all right cool.

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:43.190
He's like your mom is probably
going to kill me, but whatever.

00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:45.732
And I was like it's
fine, we're good.

00:21:45.732 --> 00:21:47.600
You know I'm 9 or
whatever, 10 or 9.

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:49.555
And I sat on the back
speakers in the back

00:21:49.555 --> 00:21:50.430
of the Laugh Factory.

00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:51.450
I got to give him his
little five minute

00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:52.730
warning with the
flashlight and tell him

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:54.104
it was time to
get off the stage.

00:21:54.104 --> 00:21:56.600
And it was kind of
awesome, it was hilarious.

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:59.520
And I mean I have a great
love for stand-up comedy,

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:02.110
and I think it really
came from those two guys.

00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:03.070
KEVIN DUNCAN: Growing
up with them, yeah, so

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:04.710
did that really shape
your guys' sense of humor,

00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:07.120
because you guys were so young
when you were on the show?

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:09.120
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE:
That's why I needed Jesus.

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:15.310
JODIE SWEETIN: It's
why I needed drugs.

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:18.425
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:22.600
Hey, look if you can't joke
about it, you know what I mean.

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:28.880
KEVIN DUNCAN: There's
no segue here.

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:29.829
There's no transition.

00:22:29.829 --> 00:22:31.912
JODIE SWEETIN: No, there
isn't, but you know what.

00:22:31.912 --> 00:22:34.710
I mean I have a pretty dark
and crazy sense of humor,

00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:37.750
and I do think that I
gained a real appreciation

00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:41.270
for the darker humors
from those guys,

00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:43.279
because they're pretty dark.

00:22:43.279 --> 00:22:44.570
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE: Mine too.

00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:47.600
Bob shaped my sense of
humor, to which I had

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:53.110
to turn it off and reshape it.

00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:57.230
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Misty and my
heart's racing, which is funny.

00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:59.520
But as you can see, we're
in a corporate environment

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:02.237
but I did a tribute to you
three by crimping my hair today.

00:23:02.237 --> 00:23:03.820
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE:
Yeah, I love it.

00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:06.570
AUDIENCE: This is not--
this is not natural.

00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:07.506
KEVIN DUNCAN: She was the
first one in the room today,

00:23:07.506 --> 00:23:07.864
by the way.

00:23:07.864 --> 00:23:09.405
AUDIENCE: I could
kind of see Candace

00:23:09.405 --> 00:23:12.624
staring at me being like, I
wonder if that's her real hair.

00:23:12.624 --> 00:23:15.812
So at Google we're taught
to take one risk every day

00:23:15.812 --> 00:23:17.270
that makes us really
uncomfortable.

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:19.040
We call it
uncomfortably excited.

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:22.870
So my question is would you
make a Googler's dream come true

00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:26.383
and take a picture with
me crimping DJ's hair?

00:23:26.383 --> 00:23:30.080
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE:
Yes, totally.

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:31.535
JODIE SWEETIN: That is awesome.

00:23:31.535 --> 00:23:34.446
AUDIENCE: I found this,
which is the three of you.

00:23:34.446 --> 00:23:35.740
JODIE SWEETIN: Aw.

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:37.490
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE:
It's a trading card.

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:39.073
AUDIENCE: I'm going
to need that back.

00:23:39.073 --> 00:23:42.944
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:42.944 --> 00:23:44.090
JODIE SWEETIN: Oh my God!

00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:44.540
AUDIENCE: I want you
guys to feel very--

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:46.320
JODIE SWEETIN: Your necklace
is fabulous by the way.

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:46.770
I love that.

00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:46.960
It's amazing.

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.170
AUDIENCE: It's Google colors.

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:49.146
JODIE SWEETIN: It's really cute.

00:23:49.146 --> 00:23:50.687
AUDIENCE: I actually
thought what I'd

00:23:50.687 --> 00:23:52.400
wear to complement you guys.

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:52.980
I want you to be very jealous.

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:53.580
JODIE SWEETIN: I was
worried about what

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:54.226
you were going to wear at home.

00:23:54.226 --> 00:23:55.170
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:23:55.170 --> 00:23:57.253
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE: She
is directing this thing.

00:23:57.253 --> 00:23:58.364
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:23:58.364 --> 00:24:00.030
ANDREA BARBER: She's
got a crimping iron

00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:00.890
and she's about
to touch her head.

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:01.710
Be careful. listen to her.

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:03.400
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE:
Should I be scared?

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:04.780
AUDIENCE: It's not
on, don't worry.

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:05.800
ANDREA BARBER: It's
not plugged in.

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:06.140
AUDIENCE: Ready?

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:07.223
We're smiling right there.

00:24:11.865 --> 00:24:12.530
Thank you.

00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:14.060
JODIE SWEETIN: You
are so welcome.

00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:15.601
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE:
You're welcome.

00:24:15.601 --> 00:24:19.637
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:19.637 --> 00:24:20.970
JODIE SWEETIN: That was awesome.

00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:22.760
The fact that you
have a crimping iron

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:24.778
impresses me greatly.

00:24:24.778 --> 00:24:28.422
AUDIENCE: It took 45
minutes to warm up.

00:24:28.422 --> 00:24:29.880
JODIE SWEETIN: Wow,
and that, yeah,

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:31.520
that was quick in like 1987.

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:33.770
ANDREA BARBER: That was the
best question on the press

00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:37.660
tour so far, hands down.

00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:40.350
KEVIN DUNCAN: Follow that up.

00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:40.850
Follow that.

00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:43.450
JODIE SWEETIN: It's just
going to get weirder.

00:24:43.450 --> 00:24:45.010
AUDIENCE: Hello,
I have two things.

00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:47.789
One, you three are all
incredibly gorgeous.

00:24:47.789 --> 00:24:48.830
JODIE SWEETIN: Thank you.

00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:50.163
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE: Thank you.

00:24:50.163 --> 00:24:52.710
AUDIENCE: And two, I have a
question for the majestic human

00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:55.360
being named Candace.

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:58.604
JODIE SWEETIN: Oh, look at
you, majestic like an eagle.

00:24:58.604 --> 00:25:01.020
AUDIENCE: I know that you were
on "Dancing with the Stars"

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:03.230
and that is one of my
all-time favorite shows.

00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:06.730
I was wondering how your
experience there was?

00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:11.057
Did you like it more than
"Full House" or equally?

00:25:11.057 --> 00:25:12.140
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE: Oh--

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:12.870
ANDREA BARBER: Pressure.

00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:13.410
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE:
No pressure.

00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:15.070
JODIE SWEETIN: [CLEARING THROAT]

00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:16.650
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE: But
nothing beats out you two.

00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:17.100
JODIE SWEETIN: OK, good.

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:18.040
Just checking.

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:20.540
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE: It was
one of the greatest experiences

00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:24.570
of my life, so much so that
I wrote my third book using

00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:26.980
"Dancing with the Stars"
as the framework for it.

00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:28.790
So it's called
"Dancing Through Life,"

00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:31.790
but I use that framework to talk
about courage and conviction.

00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:35.800
Because like you, stepping--
yeah, crimped hair.

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:40.590
I'm talking to you, and you're
like tweeting out right now.

00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:43.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:48.640
That was like my brave
moment to step out

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:50.590
on a stage and dance,
which I've never

00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:52.609
danced before on live
television every week.

00:25:52.609 --> 00:25:55.150
And I wanted to throw up every
week, because it was so scary.

00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:55.710
AUDIENCE: You were
great, by the way.

00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:57.043
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE: Thank you.

00:25:57.043 --> 00:25:59.380
So it really, it
changed me a lot

00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:01.540
and it gave me a lot of courage.

00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:06.060
And I take a lot more
risks now, and I'm not

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:08.040
scared because I got
through that process.

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:10.089
I enjoyed it, but it was scary.

00:26:10.089 --> 00:26:10.880
I loved it, though.

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:14.050
ANDREA BARBER: And she killed
it every week until the finals.

00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:15.022
I'm so proud of you.

00:26:15.022 --> 00:26:16.480
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE:
Thanks Kimmy.

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:23.220
AUDIENCE: OK, so I have two
feelings questions for you.

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:26.560
One is that for so many of us
this show is very nostalgic.

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:28.920
So I was wondering what it
was like for you guys, what

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:31.740
it felt like to sort of step
back into that nostalgia.

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:34.049
Because I think for us
watching this show is going

00:26:34.049 --> 00:26:36.090
to be as close as we can
get, but you guys almost

00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:38.631
went back in time, and so I was
wondering what that was like.

00:26:38.631 --> 00:26:41.542
And also, how did it feel when
they changed your bedrooms?

00:26:41.542 --> 00:26:43.000
And you guys
basically, when they--

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.540
in the original when they,
for me it was a little bit

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:47.705
traumatic when they--

00:26:47.705 --> 00:26:49.869
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:49.869 --> 00:26:51.660
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE:
I'm with you on that.

00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:53.470
I was like what are
these orange walls?

00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:57.811
Where's my geometric
shaped bedspread?

00:26:57.811 --> 00:26:59.602
JODIE SWEETIN: Yeah,
remember that red bed?

00:26:59.602 --> 00:27:01.880
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE:
I know, kind of sad.

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:03.295
But we had to move on.

00:27:03.295 --> 00:27:05.670
JODIE SWEETIN: I think we--
when did we change that, too?

00:27:05.670 --> 00:27:06.878
It was like the sixth season.

00:27:06.878 --> 00:27:08.910
I don't know, I felt like
it was fourth, fifth?

00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:10.570
I don't even remember.

00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:12.600
Anyway, it was traumatic.

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:14.219
We were sad, but
we did have input

00:27:14.219 --> 00:27:16.760
as to what our rooms were going
to look like, at least I did.

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:17.180
Did they give you input?

What back in the day?

00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:18.400
JODIE SWEETIN: Yeah.

I thought she

00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:19.910
was talking about the new one.

No?

she was talking about.

seen the new bedrooms.

guys were like 10 and 6.

we were little.

CANDACE CAMERON
BURE: I'm so ditzy.

00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:31.398
JODIE SWEETIN: I'm sure now
it wouldn't be traumatic.

00:27:31.398 --> 00:27:32.278
We know it's a set.

00:27:32.278 --> 00:27:33.610
It's a thing.

00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:34.535
It's OK.

00:27:34.535 --> 00:27:36.410
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE:
I was traumatic-- I was

00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:38.150
traumatized this time around.

00:27:38.150 --> 00:27:39.314
Is that wrong?

00:27:39.314 --> 00:27:40.610
JODIE SWEETIN: They haven't
changed your bedroom.

00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:42.190
It's like you're not
even in your own bedroom.

KEVIN DUNCAN: This has
gotten weird, yeah.

00:27:48.649 --> 00:27:50.857
It's gotten really weird.

00:27:50.857 --> 00:27:52.690
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE:
We get a little loopy.

00:27:52.690 --> 00:27:53.856
JODIE SWEETIN: Yeah, we did.

00:27:53.856 --> 00:27:55.250
By the end of the
day it's weird.

00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:56.570
It's really weird.

00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:58.675
No, but I don't think it
was-- I mean we had fun.

00:27:58.675 --> 00:27:59.550
We got to have input.

00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:01.310
They were always really
great at including the kids

00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:03.310
in some of the stuff
like that that went on.

00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:05.970
So we got to talk about what
we-- what posters we wanted

00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:08.710
and what we wanted our
rooms to look like.

00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:10.820
And stepping back in,
as far as nostalgia

00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:15.250
goes, to stand on the set
and work with these people

00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:20.200
that we walked away from that
home of ours 21 years ago

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:21.670
was an incredible experience.

00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:24.760
And I don't think that it's-- I
don't think anything really can

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:27.660
fully prepare you for what
that feels like to stand there

00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:31.250
in the kitchen with these people
after you know 21 years ago

00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:34.020
really tearfully saying goodbye
and closing the door on that

00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:36.030
moment.

00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:37.395
KEVIN DUNCAN: And one final one.

00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:41.370
AUDIENCE: This is crazy.

00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:45.030
I think everyone in this room
is geeking out right now,

00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:46.910
and I've never seen
anything like it.

00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:51.100
But my question is,
speaking of '90s nostalgia,

00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:52.910
I work for Google
Music, and so I'm

00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:59.670
dying to know what each of
your favorite '90s song is.

00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:03.059
ANDREA BARBER: Well, we dance
to mine on the pilot episode.

00:29:03.059 --> 00:29:05.350

right now. [SINGING] It's

00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:08.080
the right stuff, oh, oh, oh, oh.

BOTH: The right stuff.

CANDACE CAMERON-BURE: I got to--
it might be "You Oughta Know"

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:19.820
by Alanis Morisette.

00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:21.520
JODIE SWEETIN: Oh,
that's awesome.

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:22.728
KEVIN DUNCAN: That's awesome.

00:29:22.728 --> 00:29:24.360
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE:
I love Alanis.

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:26.820
JODIE SWEETIN: God, I don't
even know if I could pick one,

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:30.160
but I'm a '90s hip hop girl
so that was kind of what

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:31.310
I grew up with and liked.

00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:35.444
I was never-- the boy band thing
wasn't my, wasn't my steeze.

00:29:35.444 --> 00:29:37.110
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE:
"Baby's Got Back"?

00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:41.540
JODIE SWEETIN: No, more like
Tupac, Biggie, like that.

00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:43.040
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE:
Oh, that's me.

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:45.120
JODIE SWEETIN: Yeah, yeah.

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:49.402
Although I did-- and I think
actually that song was earlier,

00:29:49.402 --> 00:29:51.235
like late '80s, because
I seem to remember--

00:29:51.235 --> 00:29:52.090
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE: Oh was it?

00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:53.340
JODIE SWEETIN: No, "Baby's
Got Back," Sir Mix-A-Lot.

00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:54.930
That was later, never mind.

00:29:54.930 --> 00:29:57.342
We're not going to go into a
full dissection of '90s hip

00:29:57.342 --> 00:29:58.484
hop right now, but yeah.

00:29:58.484 --> 00:30:01.025
KEVIN DUNCAN: This one is too
excited to not ask, so quickly.

00:30:01.025 --> 00:30:01.590
AUDIENCE: I am,
just like everyone.

00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:03.554
JODIE SWEETIN: We'll shut up
and let you ask and answer

00:30:03.554 --> 00:30:03.770
the question.

00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:04.700
We have too much,
but we're just going

00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:06.480
to actually sit here
when everyone leaves

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:07.200
and keep talking.

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:08.150
AUDIENCE: Cool, well,
thank you for letting

00:30:08.150 --> 00:30:11.280
me ask my question, and again,
totally awesome moment for us

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:12.400
right now.

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:15.160
This one is kind of awkward,
but I wanted to ask it.

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:17.270
I was a little bit
young for the show,

00:30:17.270 --> 00:30:19.780
and I actually called
the show Michelle,

00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:21.920
because I loved her
character so much.

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:23.730
And so it was kind
of sad for me to see

00:30:23.730 --> 00:30:26.063
that Mary-Kate and Ashley
weren't going to be returning,

00:30:26.063 --> 00:30:29.272
so I just wanted to see
what your take on that was.

00:30:29.272 --> 00:30:30.980
ANDREA BARBER: Yeah,
Mary-Kate and Ashley

00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:32.146
have moved on from the show.

00:30:32.146 --> 00:30:33.894
They've moved on from Hollywood.

00:30:33.894 --> 00:30:35.560
They're not in front
of cameras anymore,

00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:37.601
and we totally respect
their decision to do that.

00:30:37.601 --> 00:30:40.019
But I think we get
that question a lot

00:30:40.019 --> 00:30:42.060
from the press about why
aren't they coming back.

00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:45.720
But I think once you start to
watch the first few episodes

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:48.770
of "Fuller House," you'll see
that it is a very full house.

00:30:48.770 --> 00:30:51.160
We have even more characters
than we did originally,

00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:52.310
if you can believe it.

00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:55.660
And so we reference Michelle's
character on the show

00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:57.517
and she's still a
part of the family,

00:30:57.517 --> 00:31:00.100
but I don't think the character
will be missed because there's

00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:01.522
so much packed into this show.

00:31:01.522 --> 00:31:03.230
AUDIENCE: And I still
love you guys, too.

00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:04.980
I just happened to call it
Michelle when I was little,

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:05.930
but you guys were great.

00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:07.346
JODIE SWEETIN:
I've heard actually

00:31:07.346 --> 00:31:10.357
that in Japan they call the
show Michelle, strangely enough.

00:31:10.357 --> 00:31:11.440
KEVIN DUNCAN: There we go.

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:12.210
ANDREA BARBER: There you go.

00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:13.668
JODIE SWEETIN: No,
I'm not kidding.

00:31:13.668 --> 00:31:16.590
I've heard that that's like a
common thing nickname for "Full

00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:19.220
House" in Japan is Michelle.

00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:20.830
AUDIENCE: Well thanks, guys.

00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:22.120
KEVIN DUNCAN: But I think
also not having Michelle

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:24.494
brought your character a little
more forward too, Andrea.

00:31:24.494 --> 00:31:27.450
I think having the balance
of you three has been just,

00:31:27.450 --> 00:31:29.580
it's been so fun and
so interesting to see.

00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:30.430

I think it's great.
