Hello, Vsauce. Michael here,
and today I have a brand new episode

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:08.790
of Vsauce Leanback, a playlist that I host
made out of awesome videos from

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.880
all over YouTube.
The theme for this one is stuff

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.570
I didn't know last week, but now I do.
It's fun and you can begin at anytime by

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:17.850
clicking the link at the top

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.100
of this video's description. If you're on a
mobile device, it probably won't work,

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.449
so wait until you're at a computer and
then you can lean back.

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:29.210
In the meantime I'm gonna give you one
cool fact and four things you can do

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.670
online now guys.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.600
Alright, first the fact.
America and Europe are on

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.930
different tectonic plates and these plates
are slowly moving apart from each other,

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.340
which means that every year America and Europe

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.539
are 1 inch further apart.
You know what else grows

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:50.640
at one inch a year?
Fingernails.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.840
What's cool about that is that,
for instance if you live in America,

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.890
every time you look at your fingernails
you can think "hmmm, since the last time I

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:58.899
clipped these,

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:02.530
Europe is that much farther away."
Pretty neat.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.590
If you enjoy deep emotional flash games,
"veronica1095" sent me a list

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.500
of some really cool ones.
But if you prefer making your own music,

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.640
check out Qwerty Beats.
All you need to be a DJ is your mouse

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.660
and your keyboard.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.800
If you want your mind blown by
perspective, play Adult Swim's Cardboard

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:24.439
Box

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:28.049
Assembler. This game is laid out on a
three-dimensional cube

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.070
and as you run around you can change what's up

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.979
and what's down. And finally, if you're one
of those people who hate Vsauce

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.759
Leanbacks because they're so long,

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.619
go check out 5secondfilms.
It's a YouTube channel

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.420
with 775 hilarious videos,

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.530
so short they're only five seconds long. And what the

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.350
H, here's a bonus.
This guy is counting to 1 billion

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.700
on YouTube.
One number at a time, one video

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.780
for each number. He's only up to about
200 right now, but let me give you a taste.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.020
Here's a good one. 23.
Twenty-three.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.640
Nice. So, what are you waiting for?

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:14.990

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.730
Leanback.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.550
And as always,

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:18.950
thanks for watching.
