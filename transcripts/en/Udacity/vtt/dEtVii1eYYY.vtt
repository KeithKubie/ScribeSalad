00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.984
Let's talk about whitespace for a moment. So, you may have

00:00:02.984 --> 00:00:05.504
noticed when I was entering text in the, in the editor

00:00:05.504 --> 00:00:08.360
before, that even though I put text on multiple lines, when

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.544
I rendered it in HTML it rendered all on a single

00:00:10.544 --> 00:00:14.830
line. This is because in HTML all whitespace, new lines, tabs,

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.250
spaces all turn into a single space. To force our HTML

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.770
to have multiple lines we can use another tag called the

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.580
br tag. It looks like this. It is also a void tag,

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.980
stands for break, and it's a void tag. And

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.229
you put this after, after any lines that you want to

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:34.340
appear on multiple lines. Let's let's play around with

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.440
this in the browser a little bit. Here we are

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.830
in the browser. Let's let's enter some text. We've

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.440
got this text that's really too long for one line,

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.060
and when we render this, it appears as one line.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.840
Let's put a line break here. When I render this,

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.080
it still appears as one line. If we

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.640
want to render multiple lines, we can enter the br

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:02.270
tag like here. No problem. And now we have a line break. And we can even enter

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.420
multiple br tags if we want multiple line

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.270
breaks. 'Kay? There we go. Two line breaks or

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.460
two br's equals two line breaks. Cool, huh? Another

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.860
way of doing line breaks is to use the

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.360
p tag. This stands for paragraph. This is not a,

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.660
a void tag. So the p tag has content and

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.610
it looks like this. So it's, that you know, because

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.700
it's not a void tag, it has a closing tag, and

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.360
we have a opening tag. So you've got opening p,

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.680
content, closing p, and this will render as one paragraph.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.050
let's check this out in the browser really quick Okay.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.190
So we've got these two lines. Let's take a different approach.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.990
I'm going to start this line with a paragraph tag,

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.650
and we'll, we'll render this. Ah-ha. Now we've got a

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.710
line break here in our text. Now the font got

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.360
bigger, and that's kind of a side effect of our,

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.330
of our HTML tool. It must be some sort of

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.670
style set on p. That doesn't normally happen. I'm going to

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.760
wrap the, the bottom line with a paragraph as well.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.344
Okay. There we go. Now we've got two lines the

00:02:06.344 --> 00:02:08.810
same kind of basic idea as we had before.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.195
Now, we'll, we'll talk about why there's this extra space

00:02:11.195 --> 00:02:13.265
in here even though there's no space between this

00:02:13.265 --> 00:02:15.260
text up here. We'll come to that in a minute.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.290
But first, quiz time. Take this text here. Hello,

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.750
everyone, we're using two lines now. And enter the HTML

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.220
to draw that as it's formatted here, with two lines.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.610
And I want you to use the, the br tag.
