00:00:07.876 --> 00:00:12.656
&gt;&gt;Our goal today is to figure
out if we are going to buy,

00:00:13.016 --> 00:00:17.856
sell or hold the security that we've
already purchased in the portfolio.

00:00:17.856 --> 00:00:21.126
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Many teachers use
fictional stock portfolios

00:00:21.126 --> 00:00:23.146
to help students hone math skills.

00:00:23.196 --> 00:00:24.376
&gt;&gt;Connie: You bought Disney

00:00:24.376 --> 00:00:27.626
at thirty-five dollars
and fourteen cents.

00:00:27.776 --> 00:00:28.346
Where is it now?

00:00:28.936 --> 00:00:30.876
&gt;&gt;Narrator: But at the
Ariel Community Academy

00:00:30.876 --> 00:00:35.066
on Chicago's South Side, students
have a vested interest in learning

00:00:35.306 --> 00:00:37.196
because they're risking real money.

00:00:37.306 --> 00:00:38.906
&gt;&gt;Connie: What are our options?

00:00:38.906 --> 00:00:39.906
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Lots of it.

00:00:39.906 --> 00:00:42.076
&gt;&gt;Student: I say hold because
this one went up a dollar

00:00:42.076 --> 00:00:45.446
and now it may go up even more
in another period of time.

00:00:45.446 --> 00:00:49.486
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Each Ariel class receives
an endowment of 20,000 dollars

00:00:49.486 --> 00:00:52.296
which they begin to actively
manage in sixth grade.

00:00:52.296 --> 00:00:56.296
&gt;&gt;James: I'll say hold it because you
sell it right now all you're doing is

00:00:56.706 --> 00:00:57.936
making basically like
a dollar profit.

00:00:58.826 --> 00:01:01.876
&gt;&gt;Narrator: When they graduate
eighth grade the class donates half

00:01:01.876 --> 00:01:03.416
of their profits to charity.

00:01:03.946 --> 00:01:07.186
Each student receives an equal
share of the remaining profits,

00:01:07.526 --> 00:01:11.376
usually just over 100 dollars
to invest on their own.

00:01:11.376 --> 00:01:13.266
&gt;&gt;James: The money I
make with investments,

00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:16.556
I will put that towards some
the college tuition and all

00:01:16.556 --> 00:01:19.986
that because I know that's very
expensive, laptops, books, classes.

00:01:20.636 --> 00:01:23.856
&gt;&gt;Narrator: This unique public school
private business partnership was

00:01:23.896 --> 00:01:26.576
created by financier John Rogers.

00:01:26.576 --> 00:01:27.926
&gt;&gt;John: What would be
the reason to buy a stock

00:01:27.926 --> 00:01:29.446
after it's going down
a lot like that?

00:01:29.816 --> 00:01:32.256
&gt;&gt;Narrator: And Chicago's
schools' Chief, Arne Duncan.

00:01:32.256 --> 00:01:34.936
&gt;&gt;Arne Duncan: Ariel was how I
got my start in public education.

00:01:35.206 --> 00:01:38.446
I ran John Rogers'
nonprofit the Ariel Foundation

00:01:38.976 --> 00:01:41.216
for about six years starting in 1992.

00:01:41.216 --> 00:01:45.936
And in 1995 we were young
and dumb enough to think

00:01:45.936 --> 00:01:47.586
that we could create
a great public school.

00:01:48.236 --> 00:01:49.906
&gt;&gt;Student: So let the stock grow

00:01:49.906 --> 00:01:52.206
and then you can sell
it and make more money.

00:01:52.296 --> 00:01:55.656
&gt;&gt;John: We think by exposing our
African American boys and girls

00:01:55.656 --> 00:01:58.936
to the stock market at an
early age it's really helping

00:01:58.936 --> 00:02:00.466
to enhance their math skills.

00:02:00.936 --> 00:02:04.296
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Ariel's test scores
have soared over the past five years

00:02:04.296 --> 00:02:08.456
with 88 percent of the students
exceeding state standards in math.

00:02:08.456 --> 00:02:11.416
&gt;&gt;John: If you think about it, if
you're picking stocks or having

00:02:11.416 --> 00:02:14.256
to understand about growth rates
and percentage growth rates year

00:02:14.256 --> 00:02:17.816
over year and quarter by quarter
there's just so much math involved.

00:02:17.936 --> 00:02:20.656
And so I think it's just natural
for our kids to be doing so well now

00:02:20.656 --> 00:02:23.226
that they've been exposed to the
markets over a long period of time.

00:02:23.776 --> 00:02:25.316
&gt;&gt;Mariah Sheriff: Can someone
tell me what's their decision?

00:02:25.566 --> 00:02:28.896
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Exposure to the
financial literacy curriculum starts

00:02:28.896 --> 00:02:33.186
in kindergarten and echoes across
every subject in every grade.

00:02:33.716 --> 00:02:35.926
&gt;&gt;Student: It would have
an opportunity cost to go

00:02:35.926 --> 00:02:38.886
to circusland or buy a new TV.

00:02:39.036 --> 00:02:41.426
&gt;&gt;Mariah Sheriff: Very
good, can you say that big,

00:02:41.426 --> 00:02:43.286
big word you just used again?

00:02:43.286 --> 00:02:44.466
&gt;&gt;Student: Opportunity cost.

00:02:44.466 --> 00:02:46.346
&gt;&gt;Mariah Sheriff: Opportunity
cost and that's what we have

00:02:46.346 --> 00:02:48.556
when we have a decision
to make, right?

00:02:48.556 --> 00:02:51.616
&gt;&gt;Teachers always look for the real
world application of their curriculum

00:02:51.616 --> 00:02:52.846
and I don't ever have to do that.

00:02:53.286 --> 00:02:56.016
It's never a search for
why this is going to apply?

00:02:56.016 --> 00:02:58.776
It's just a matter of
making it so engaging

00:02:58.776 --> 00:03:00.676
that they will take it
home and talk about it.

00:03:00.676 --> 00:03:02.536
&gt;&gt;And what is it called when
you put money in your bank?

00:03:03.056 --> 00:03:03.686
&gt;&gt;Everybody: Deposit.

00:03:04.106 --> 00:03:06.096
&gt;&gt;Mariah Sheriff: I'm going
to teach personal finance.

00:03:06.096 --> 00:03:10.426
I'm going to teach investments
and in seventh grade we talk

00:03:10.426 --> 00:03:14.516
about international trade and we
talk about foreign exchange market

00:03:14.516 --> 00:03:18.146
and how that's a thriving market
that our kids might be involved in.

00:03:18.146 --> 00:03:20.476
&gt;&gt;Student: One of the negatives is

00:03:20.476 --> 00:03:22.696
that they probably have
some more competition.

00:03:23.606 --> 00:03:25.126
&gt;&gt;Connie: They're just
not regurgitating a set

00:03:25.126 --> 00:03:26.186
of vocabulary words.

00:03:26.446 --> 00:03:28.926
They actually are looking out
into their community and trying

00:03:28.926 --> 00:03:32.866
to understand their place in it
and processing that information.

00:03:33.156 --> 00:03:35.876
&gt;&gt;James: Yeah, plus they global
because they got Hong Kong Disney,

00:03:36.066 --> 00:03:37.876
they got California Disneyland.

00:03:38.096 --> 00:03:40.756
&gt;&gt;Connie: There are some students
in the classroom that are saying

00:03:40.756 --> 00:03:43.176
"You know I want to be
an entrepreneur one day."

00:03:43.646 --> 00:03:46.026
&gt;&gt;Humu: Before I took this class
I said I wanted to be a doctor.

00:03:46.526 --> 00:03:50.336
Then I wanted to be a nurse, then I
wanted to be this, a brain surgeon,

00:03:50.636 --> 00:03:54.186
but since, after a while I see
that this is my favorite class.

00:03:54.186 --> 00:03:57.726
I like picking stocks and working
for myself so instead of working

00:03:57.786 --> 00:03:59.946
for somebody else I would
like to be an entrepreneur.

00:04:00.056 --> 00:04:02.986
&gt;&gt;Raven: And my business
is called Bling Things.

00:04:03.166 --> 00:04:06.906
I put rhinestones on
accessories and electronics.

00:04:07.616 --> 00:04:10.676
&gt;&gt;Narrator: As a culminating activity
eighth graders apply what they've

00:04:10.676 --> 00:04:14.136
learned about marketing, income
projections, and other aspects

00:04:14.136 --> 00:04:17.666
of creating a business by writing
and presenting business plans.

00:04:17.666 --> 00:04:22.306
&gt;&gt;Student: My market segment was
we target the 70 percent of gamers

00:04:22.776 --> 00:04:25.236
who request professional
aid when gaming.

00:04:25.896 --> 00:04:28.896
Our target customer was any
gamer holding a vested interest

00:04:28.896 --> 00:04:30.106
in mastering the games they owned.

00:04:30.106 --> 00:04:32.716
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Okay now both
plans are pretty good.

00:04:33.196 --> 00:04:37.726
But the end all of both
business plans must be the return

00:04:37.726 --> 00:04:38.996
on investments.

00:04:39.056 --> 00:04:42.676
&gt;&gt;Judith K. Shelton: This curriculum
is not just about investing.

00:04:43.066 --> 00:04:47.716
It's also about a long-term
partnership on the part of a company

00:04:48.326 --> 00:04:50.946
in the immediate lives
of children and families.

00:04:51.176 --> 00:04:52.706
&gt;&gt;Woman: So how was
your day today, guys?

00:04:52.746 --> 00:04:52.836
&gt;&gt;Student: Good.

00:04:52.836 --> 00:04:55.606
&gt;&gt;Judith K. Shelton: There
are values of that company

00:04:55.606 --> 00:04:59.746
that children themselves have seen:
the idea of honest enterprise,

00:05:00.476 --> 00:05:04.116
the idea of looking
for an opportunity

00:05:04.446 --> 00:05:08.726
to change and benefit one's self.

00:05:08.726 --> 00:05:10.646
&gt;&gt;Matthew Yale: Ariel is a
very unique place to work.

00:05:11.026 --> 00:05:13.926
We have people who really
are committed to more

00:05:13.926 --> 00:05:15.516
than just their day-to-day jobs.

00:05:15.796 --> 00:05:20.246
Employees are here at the building
tutoring, planning the garden,

00:05:20.366 --> 00:05:24.196
any type of project that needs
to be done so we have between 20

00:05:24.196 --> 00:05:26.526
and 25 employees who are
helping out in the school.

00:05:26.756 --> 00:05:27.576
&gt;&gt;What stock did you pick?

00:05:27.576 --> 00:05:27.936
I forgot.

00:05:28.016 --> 00:05:28.936
&gt;&gt;Student: I picked Sony.

00:05:29.376 --> 00:05:30.076
&gt;&gt;Matthew Yale: Yeah, why?

00:05:30.246 --> 00:05:33.116
&gt;&gt;Student: Because I looked at Sony's
competitor which was [Inaudible].

00:05:33.506 --> 00:05:33.696
&gt;&gt;Matthew Yale: Okay.

00:05:33.816 --> 00:05:37.796
&gt;&gt;It's an extraordinary opportunity
to really be making a difference

00:05:37.796 --> 00:05:38.826
in the public education system.

00:05:38.896 --> 00:05:40.866
&gt;&gt;John: So you want to
walk on through now.

00:05:41.566 --> 00:05:44.546
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At the end of the year
Ariel students visited the corporate

00:05:44.546 --> 00:05:47.956
headquarters of McDonalds to
mingle with other shareholders

00:05:47.956 --> 00:05:50.126
and executives at the
company's annual meeting.

00:05:50.126 --> 00:05:52.586
&gt;&gt;John: And without
further ado, Don Thompson,

00:05:52.586 --> 00:05:55.316
President of McDonalds, U.S.A.

00:05:55.316 --> 00:05:56.676
&gt;&gt;Every year we try to have one

00:05:56.676 --> 00:05:59.476
of the [inaudible] African
American executives come in and talk

00:05:59.476 --> 00:06:02.356
with the kids and hopefully
be a role model for the kind

00:06:02.356 --> 00:06:04.846
of successful business
people they can emulate.

00:06:04.926 --> 00:06:06.796
&gt;&gt;Don Thompson: When I was your age,
I didn't even know what a stock was.

00:06:07.376 --> 00:06:09.806
Let alone to be able
to get some education

00:06:09.806 --> 00:06:12.456
and begin to understand business.

00:06:12.646 --> 00:06:14.386
And so I'm impressed
with what you all do.

00:06:14.386 --> 00:06:16.806
I hope you know that what you
are doing is very special.

00:06:17.246 --> 00:06:19.676
I wanted to take a couple
of minutes to open it up,

00:06:19.896 --> 00:06:22.286
answer any questions you
have you could ask me.

00:06:22.656 --> 00:06:23.686
&gt;&gt;Student: Do you pick stocks?

00:06:23.786 --> 00:06:25.936
If so, what type?

00:06:26.486 --> 00:06:27.726
&gt;&gt;Don Thompson: First of
all, I'm jealous, see.

00:06:27.726 --> 00:06:30.416
I don't have nearly the knowledge
you all have about the market.

00:06:30.416 --> 00:06:32.676
I don't study it the same way you do.

00:06:32.676 --> 00:06:35.236
&gt;&gt;This kind of education sets
them up for the business world.

00:06:35.236 --> 00:06:36.776
It sets them up for
international ventures.

00:06:36.776 --> 00:06:40.896
It helps them become more rounded
and they create aspirations

00:06:40.896 --> 00:06:44.076
within themselves to do
something so great that many

00:06:44.076 --> 00:06:45.806
of us could never even imagine it.

00:06:45.806 --> 00:06:49.016
&gt;&gt;Student: Was it hard to
become what you are now?

00:06:49.016 --> 00:06:50.366
&gt;&gt;Don Thompson: Is it hard?

00:06:50.416 --> 00:06:54.796
It's only as hard as you make it
if you're not focused on today.

00:06:54.796 --> 00:06:57.536
Be focused on being
the best you can today.

00:06:57.536 --> 00:07:01.476
Everything else takes care of itself.

00:07:02.016 --> 00:07:03.976
