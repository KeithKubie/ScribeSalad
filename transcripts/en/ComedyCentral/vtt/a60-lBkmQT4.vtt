00:00:01.034 --> 00:00:02.101
GREY:<i> This weekend,
 the American public</i>

00:00:02.134 --> 00:00:03.503
<i> saw some upsetting things</i>

00:00:03.536 --> 00:00:05.905
<i> about the current state
 of U.S. immigration.</i>

00:00:05.938 --> 00:00:08.441
The Trump administration policy
of zero tolerance

00:00:08.474 --> 00:00:11.477
that has resulted
in nearly 2,000 children

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.312
being separated
from their families.

00:00:13.345 --> 00:00:15.581
GREY:<i> I was so upset
 I had to do something about it,</i>

00:00:15.614 --> 00:00:16.983
<i> which is why...</i>

00:00:17.016 --> 00:00:20.119
I'm here in D.C. to expose
the Democrats' cruel treatment

00:00:20.152 --> 00:00:22.121
of Trump's immigration policies.

00:00:22.154 --> 00:00:24.090
They want to open up our borders
like Swiss cheese

00:00:24.123 --> 00:00:26.159
and let MS-13 run for Congress.

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:29.128
<i> Conservatives agree
 immigrant families are scary.</i>

00:00:29.161 --> 00:00:30.863
Alien minors.

00:00:30.896 --> 00:00:32.665
They look so innocent.
They're not innocent.

00:00:32.698 --> 00:00:34.634
You have unaccompanied minors
coming over

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:35.902
with gang affiliation.

00:00:35.935 --> 00:00:37.303
-Don't come to this country
-Tomi, let me...

00:00:37.336 --> 00:00:39.005
-and complain about the rule
of law. -Tomi, let me ask you...

00:00:39.038 --> 00:00:40.873
These child actors
weeping and crying

00:00:40.906 --> 00:00:43.876
on all the other networks
24/7 right now.

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:46.913
Do not fall for it,
Mr. President.

00:00:46.946 --> 00:00:49.215
GREY:<i> Over the weekend,
 eight Dems had the gall</i>

00:00:49.248 --> 00:00:50.750
<i> to question this policy</i>

00:00:50.783 --> 00:00:52.552
<i> by visiting
 these detention centers</i>

00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:55.688
<i> to-- get this--
 see if the kids were okay.</i>

00:00:55.721 --> 00:00:59.525
<i> Their sick ringleader,
 Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon,</i>

00:00:59.558 --> 00:01:00.960
<i> who wants us to believe</i>

00:01:00.993 --> 00:01:04.063
<i> this attitude
 towards immigrants is inhumane.</i>

00:01:04.096 --> 00:01:05.565
I think
that is a horrific attitude

00:01:05.598 --> 00:01:06.666
for the United States.

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:08.234
Instead of protecting children,

00:01:08.267 --> 00:01:12.371
we're going to proceed
to inflict harm on them.

00:01:12.404 --> 00:01:14.540
GREY:<i> The first time he visited,
 they called the cops on him,</i>

00:01:14.573 --> 00:01:15.875
<i> which makes sense,</i>

00:01:15.908 --> 00:01:17.977
<i> because the conservative media
 knows that Merkley</i>

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.979
<i> is the real threat here.</i>

00:01:20.012 --> 00:01:22.515
Is this just a publicity stunt?

00:01:22.548 --> 00:01:24.817
Oh, it's completely a stunt.
I mean, he had the media there.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.152
GREY:
<i> Well, guess what, libs?</i>

00:01:26.185 --> 00:01:28.788
<i> I can play at this
 publicity stunt game, too.</i>

00:01:28.821 --> 00:01:30.022
I'm gonna turn the tables.

00:01:30.055 --> 00:01:32.391
I'm here at his office.
Watch him throw me out.

00:01:32.424 --> 00:01:34.393
-Oh, hi, Laura
from<i> The Opposition.</i> -Oh.

00:01:34.426 --> 00:01:36.028
-I'm so glad you found
my office. -Hi.

00:01:36.061 --> 00:01:37.363
He's probably calling the cops
on me right now.

00:01:37.396 --> 00:01:38.565
-Come on in.
-Okay.

00:01:41.567 --> 00:01:44.470
So, we're just gonna talk?

00:01:44.503 --> 00:01:45.838
Let's jump in.

00:01:45.871 --> 00:01:47.340
So, tell me a little bit

00:01:47.373 --> 00:01:49.909
about your decision
to visit the processing center,

00:01:49.942 --> 00:01:51.744
this publicity stunt of yours.

00:01:51.777 --> 00:01:55.414
So, my agenda was to find out

00:01:55.447 --> 00:01:58.117
if we had, in fact,
implemented this new policy

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.520
of traumatizing children

00:02:00.553 --> 00:02:02.555
by tearing them away
from their families

00:02:02.588 --> 00:02:05.091
when the refugees
are coming to seek asylum.

00:02:05.124 --> 00:02:08.227
How far are you willing to go
with these publicity stunts?

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.263
What's next?
Are you gonna shed light

00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:13.266
on sexual accusations
against ICE?

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:14.967
Are you gonna shed light
on the fact

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.303
that statistically
there is no correlation

00:02:17.336 --> 00:02:20.039
between immigrant populations
and violent crime?

00:02:20.072 --> 00:02:21.507
Where does it end?

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.809
Well, I would say
we need a lot of light shined

00:02:23.842 --> 00:02:26.078
on a catastrophic policy

00:02:26.111 --> 00:02:27.847
that's being financed
with our taxpayer dollars.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.183
-So you admit it?
-Absolutely.

00:02:30.216 --> 00:02:33.486
Boom. Caught that on camera.

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:36.822
You're fighting for this
humanitarian children's cause.

00:02:36.855 --> 00:02:38.257
Guilty.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.026 line:0%
GREY:
<i> Busted!</i>

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:42.495
<i> Before, when families
 were detained at the border,</i>

00:02:42.528 --> 00:02:43.863
<i> they were typically
 kept together</i>

00:02:43.896 --> 00:02:45.364
<i> to await civil trial.</i>

00:02:45.397 --> 00:02:46.933
<i> Now, under Trump,</i>

00:02:46.966 --> 00:02:48.668
<i> all migrants
 crossing the border</i>

00:02:48.701 --> 00:02:50.303
<i> are criminally prosecuted,</i>

00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:52.271
<i> which means
 the parents go to jail</i>

00:02:52.304 --> 00:02:53.940
<i> while their kids
 are given a blanket</i>

00:02:53.973 --> 00:02:55.541
<i> and shipped off
 to a detention center</i>

00:02:55.574 --> 00:02:57.343
<i> to hang out in a cage.</i>

00:02:57.376 --> 00:02:59.312
Some have referred to them
as "cages,"

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:01.547
but keep in mind,
they built walls

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.316
out of chain-link fences.

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:04.951
GREY:
<i> Sorry, not cages.</i>

00:03:04.984 --> 00:03:06.886
<i> I meant a wall made out
 of a chain-link fence.</i>

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:08.287
<i> Totally different.</i>

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.656
<i> The point is
 it's not really that bad.</i>

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:13.426
It was a shocking sight
to walk in initially,

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.362
just to see so many people
so distressed,

00:03:16.395 --> 00:03:18.564
a number of people crying.

00:03:18.597 --> 00:03:20.333
They look like big cages

00:03:20.366 --> 00:03:22.702
or maybe the way you would
construct a dog kennel.

00:03:22.735 --> 00:03:23.869
Do you know kids?

00:03:23.902 --> 00:03:25.871
You throw a cage
in the middle of the room,

00:03:25.904 --> 00:03:27.006
and they'll run into it.

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:29.609
It's, like, basically
a free jungle gym.

00:03:29.642 --> 00:03:31.811
Well, it didn't appear
that any children

00:03:31.844 --> 00:03:34.146
were having much fun
when I was there.

00:03:34.179 --> 00:03:37.750
GREY:<i> Merkley seems determined
 to inhumanely force Trump</i>

00:03:37.783 --> 00:03:40.987
<i> to separate from his campaign
 promises on immigration.</i>

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.589
I would love to be able
to rip that policy from them

00:03:43.622 --> 00:03:44.957
and-and end it.

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:46.859
You're a monster.

00:03:46.892 --> 00:03:48.361
<i> Merkley's ridiculous stunt</i>

00:03:48.394 --> 00:03:49.862
<i> of showing the plight
 of children</i>

00:03:49.895 --> 00:03:51.897
<i> in cages on American soil</i>

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.366
<i> is somehow working.</i>

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:56.235
<i> Democrats, former first ladies,
 current first ladies,</i>

00:03:56.268 --> 00:03:57.603
<i> Republicans like Rick Scott</i>

00:03:57.636 --> 00:03:59.839
<i> are even crossing
 sacred party lines</i>

00:03:59.872 --> 00:04:01.507
<i> to speak out against it.</i>

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.311
And I don't think there's
any moral code in the universe

00:04:05.344 --> 00:04:07.179
or any religious tradition

00:04:07.212 --> 00:04:10.049
that finds it morally acceptable

00:04:10.082 --> 00:04:13.552
to hurt children
in order to influence parents.

00:04:13.585 --> 00:04:15.955
These asylum seekers
are individuals

00:04:15.988 --> 00:04:18.891
who have gone through
horrific circumstances.

00:04:18.924 --> 00:04:20.059
That's seared into my mind.

00:04:20.092 --> 00:04:21.827
That's going to stick with me
for a long time.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.297
Lucky for me,
nothing gets seared in here.

00:04:25.664 --> 00:04:28.501
Dead as a doornail inside.

00:04:28.534 --> 00:04:30.169
<i> There is one other
 American hero</i>

00:04:30.202 --> 00:04:31.904
<i> who is also dead inside,</i>

00:04:31.937 --> 00:04:34.707
<i> and here is what he's saying
 about the immigration policy.</i>

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.742
With all of that being said,
we're doing a great job.

00:04:36.775 --> 00:04:38.111
(air horn blowing)
