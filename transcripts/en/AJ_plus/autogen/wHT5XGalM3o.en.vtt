mass incarceration for a few reasons one

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409
mass incarceration for a few reasons one
 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.770
mass incarceration for a few reasons one
is that increased incarceration has

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780
is that increased incarceration has
 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.080
is that increased incarceration has
meant that more nonviolent offenders

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090
meant that more nonviolent offenders
 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.670
meant that more nonviolent offenders
have gotten locked up which obviously

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680
have gotten locked up which obviously
 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.260
have gotten locked up which obviously
doesn't have a big impact on violent

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270
doesn't have a big impact on violent
 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.330
doesn't have a big impact on violent
crime and the Brenden center's numbers

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340
crime and the Brenden center's numbers
 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.219
crime and the Brenden center's numbers
show that increase incarceration doesn't

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229
show that increase incarceration doesn't
 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.590
show that increase incarceration doesn't
even necessarily deter crime which might

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600
even necessarily deter crime which might

even necessarily deter crime which might
help explain why in some large states

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430
help explain why in some large states
 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.300
help explain why in some large states
like California the prison population

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310
like California the prison population
 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.160
like California the prison population
has decreased and crime has still gone

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170
has decreased and crime has still gone
 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.530
has decreased and crime has still gone
down so obviously jailing more and more

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540
down so obviously jailing more and more
 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.660
down so obviously jailing more and more
people doesn't explain why crime has

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670
people doesn't explain why crime has
 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.630
people doesn't explain why crime has
gone down another theory new police

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640
gone down another theory new police
 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.149
gone down another theory new police
strategies in the 90s increased funding

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159
strategies in the 90s increased funding

put more police officers on the streets

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079
put more police officers on the streets
 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.960
put more police officers on the streets
and some argue that those numbers helped

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970
and some argue that those numbers helped
 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.880
and some argue that those numbers helped
reduce crime but others say the evidence

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890
reduce crime but others say the evidence
 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.100
reduce crime but others say the evidence
isn't totally consistent in San Diego

isn't totally consistent in San Diego
 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.810
isn't totally consistent in San Diego
for example there were no extra police

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820
for example there were no extra police
 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.670
for example there were no extra police
officers and yet crime still went down

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680
officers and yet crime still went down
 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.010
officers and yet crime still went down
there then there's police strategies

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020
there then there's police strategies
 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.080
there then there's police strategies
like broken windows which targets

low-level crimes and misdemeanors things
 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.649
low-level crimes and misdemeanors things
like selling loose cigarettes on the

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659
like selling loose cigarettes on the
 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.480
like selling loose cigarettes on the
street or smoking weed out in the open

the jury's still out on how big of a

the jury's still out on how big of a
 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.350

finally the introduction of something
called CompStat definitely seems to have

it's likely that police did play a role

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250
it's likely that police did play a role
 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.190
it's likely that police did play a role
in the crime drop but that's not the

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200
in the crime drop but that's not the
 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.630
in the crime drop but that's not the
only explanation

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640

only explanation
the third big factor the economy the

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040
the third big factor the economy the
 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.560
the third big factor the economy the
idea is that when more people have jobs

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570
idea is that when more people have jobs
 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.380

there's less crime as unemployment went

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390
there's less crime as unemployment went
 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.570
there's less crime as unemployment went
down in the 90s crime also went down and

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580
down in the 90s crime also went down and
 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.430
down in the 90s crime also went down and
as unemployment went up in the 2000

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440
as unemployment went up in the 2000
 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.680

crime also saw a small increase it gets
 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.150
crime also saw a small increase it gets
complicated though when you consider

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160
complicated though when you consider
 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.370
complicated though when you consider
that the recession in 2008 didn't

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380
that the recession in 2008 didn't
 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.380
that the recession in 2008 didn't
actually lead to an increase in crime so

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390
actually lead to an increase in crime so
 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.840
actually lead to an increase in crime so
what about income as per-capita income

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850
what about income as per-capita income
 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.150
what about income as per-capita income
grew in the 90s crime decreased in fact

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160
grew in the 90s crime decreased in fact
 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.710
grew in the 90s crime decreased in fact
the higher the average income in the

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720
the higher the average income in the
 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.320
the higher the average income in the
state the lower the crime rate but more

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330
state the lower the crime rate but more
 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.300
state the lower the crime rate but more
money could mean more incentive for

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310
money could mean more incentive for
 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.920
money could mean more incentive for
criminals like in neighborhoods that

criminals like in neighborhoods that

criminals like in neighborhoods that
have a big economic disparity so

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300
have a big economic disparity so
 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.300
have a big economic disparity so
obviously the crime drop is pretty hard

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310
obviously the crime drop is pretty hard
 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.190
obviously the crime drop is pretty hard
to explain and there's a whole bunch of
