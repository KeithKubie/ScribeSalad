00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.702
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Here's another quadratic polynomial, x squared minus 9. And even though this

00:00:04.702 --> 00:00:09.454
poly looks a little bit different, from the other quadratic polynomials we've

00:00:09.454 --> 00:00:14.313
seen, we can still write it as the product of two linear factors. Remember that,

00:00:14.313 --> 00:00:19.011
being quadratic means that a polynomial is of second degree. And being linear

00:00:19.011 --> 00:00:23.910
means that an expression is of first degree. So what two linear factors multiply

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.609
to give us x squared minus 9?
