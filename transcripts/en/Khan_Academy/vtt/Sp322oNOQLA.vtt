00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.150
- [Instructor] In this
video, we're gonna build

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:04.030
on what we already know
about aggregate demand

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:06.800
and aggregate supply,
and the Phillips curve,

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.420
and we are going to connect these ideas.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.900
So first, the Phillips curve.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.300
This is a typical Phillips
curve for an economy.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.060
High inflation is associated
with low unemployment,

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.900
high unemployment is
associated with low inflation,

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.700
but we can really view this curve

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.210
as the short run Phillips curve.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.520
Short run Phillips curve.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.060
We might sit at different
points on this curve

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.150
at different points in an economic cycle,

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:32.950
but we could also introduce an idea

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.340
known as a long run Phillips curve,

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.900
which is just based on the natural rate

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.860
of unemployment for this economy.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.650
So let's say the natural
rate of unemployment

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.260
for this economy is 6%.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.340
So, then our long run Phillips curve

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.560
would just be a vertical
line right over there.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.640
Long run Phillips curve.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.150
Now why is it a vertical line?

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.990
Well it says in the long
run, our natural rate

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.880
of unemployment is 6%

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.140
regardless of what the
inflation rate might be.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.670
And so if we are sitting
at the intersection

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.090
of these two curves, that means

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.660
that our economy right
in this moment in time

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.220
is operating at full employment.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.700
If unemployment was lower than that,

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.690
it would be overheating to some degree,

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.560
and if unemployment were higher than that,

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.000
then we would have a negative output gap.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.500
But how do we tie these ideas

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.870
to aggregate demand and aggregate supply?

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.010
Well let's draw our long
run aggregate supply curve,

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.750
and I'm gonna do it
right at the intersection

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.060
of our aggregate demand and
short run aggregate supply curve

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.810
for now, because I wanna show an economy

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.340
that's operating at its full potential.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.850
So here, this is our long
run aggregate supply,

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.490
and once again it's a vertical line

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.400
because in the long run,
regardless of the price level,

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.650
we have a certain output for this economy

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:51.870
that is sustainable.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.380
So that is our full employment.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.940
I'll do F, period, E, period.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.690
That's our full employment output.

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.870
Anything more than
that, it's unsustainable

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.030
based on where the economy
is structurally right now,

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.710
and anything less than that,

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.410
is you have a negative output gap.

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.220
But now let's think
about what would happen

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.160
if we start shifting curves around.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.600
What if we were to have
a negative demand shock?

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.750
So our aggregate demand
curve shifts to the left.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.020
Well in that world, and
this is all a review,

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.280
you can see that your equilibrium price,

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.110
so I'm gonna call this
aggregate demand sub two,

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.620
our price level two, and
our new equilibrium output

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.610
for our economy sub two.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.500
You can see that both are lower.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.770
We now have a negative output gap.

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.050
But what would that correspond to here

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.500
on our Phillips curves?

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.740
Well, when you have a negative output gap,

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.120
you're likely to have higher unemployment.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.750
And shifts in aggregate in
the aggregate demand curve

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.700
would be movements along the
short run Phillips curve.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.990
So we're gonna move along
the short run Phillips curve,

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.860
and we're going to have
higher unemployment,

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.930
'cause we have a negative output gap.

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.210
So we might get to that
point right over there.

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.290
So I'll just call that point sub two.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.820
So we went from a situation where before,

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.660
we had 6% unemployment,

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.090
and let's say we had 3% inflation,

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.380
to a world where maybe now, we have,

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.050
I don't know, let's
call it 9% unemployment,

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.330
and now we have 2% inflation.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:20.740
And it could go the other way around.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.290
Let's say we were
starting from our original

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.040
aggregate demand curve and you
have a positive demand shock,

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.760
and so now you could go to this curve,

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.340
aggregate demand three, and so here,

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.550
our equilibrium price level is higher.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.070
It's called P sub three.

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.960
And our equilibrium output,

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.670
we have a positive output
gap, so Y sub three.

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.310
And that would correspond to,

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:46.940
if we have a positive output gap,

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.670
that means we have very low unemployment,

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.520
maybe unsustainably low unemployment.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.870
So we might be right over here.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.350
So this might be a situation
where our unemployment rate,

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.520
let's say that's about, I don't know, 4%.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.220
And now our inflation, this might be,

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.300
let's call that 4% as well.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.220
And something interesting happens

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.120
as you start to have higher
and higher inflation.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.300
That can lead to people just
having higher expectations

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.870
for price and higher expectations
for inflation itself.

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.900
And if folks have higher
expectations for inflation,

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.560
well then they might wanna charge more

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.610
for a certain level of output.

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.640
So let's say at this level of output,

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.280
people might want to have
a higher price level.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.150
At this level of output,
people might wanna have

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.180
a higher level price,
a higher price level.

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.970
And so it could actually shift

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.890
our short run aggregate supply up,

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:39.880
or you could say to the left.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.650
So short run aggregate supply,
I'll call that sub three.

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.220
Now when the short run aggregate supply

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.440
gets shifted to the
left in this situation,

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.160
notice we're back to our
full employment output,

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.030
but our price level is now much higher.

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.810
Now what would that
correspond to over here?

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:00.820
Well when you have a shift

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.370
in short run aggregate supply curves,

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.090
that would actually lead to a shift

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.340
in your short run Phillips curve,

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.000
but which way would it shift?

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.560
Well another way to think about it is,

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.950
at a given, just as at
a given level of output

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.310
you would've expected a higher price

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.800
because of this increased
inflation expectations,

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.310
so here, at a given level of unemployment,

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.650
you would expect a higher
level of inflation.

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.020
So, our curve, you would say
shifts up or to the right.

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.036
So we would then have a short run

00:05:29.036 --> 00:05:32.350
Phillips curve that looks like this.

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.310
I'll call that sub three.

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.030
And we might get back to this point.

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.650
Well for sure if were at
this full employment output,

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.450
then we are operating in our natural rate

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:43.100
of unemployment again, but notice,

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.080
now our inflation has crept even higher.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.140
This might be 5% inflation.

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.180
Now the last thing you
might be wondering about

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.520
is when do these long
run curves ever shift?

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.810
Well we've talked about it before

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.050
when we talked about long
run aggregate supply,

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.400
and that shifts if the economy
structurally changes somehow.

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.300
Let's say our factories get bombed out

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.480
in a war or something, then
this should shift to the left.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:10.200
And if we got better
technology, or better ways

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.540
of organizing ourselves,
or more resources,

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:14.300
this might shift to the right.

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.650
Similarly, if there's a
massive shift in global trade,

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:20.650
and maybe our workers' skills
aren't as valuable anymore

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:24.000
in the global economy, this
long run Phillips curve

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.780
might shift to the right.

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.410
If all of a sudden we are
able to, or over time,

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:30.120
we're able to get people more skilled,

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.500
maybe we get frictional unemployment down

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.100
because we have better
technology to place people,

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.453
well that might shift this to the left.
