00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.340
10 Minute NFL Games... and 6 other Sports
Facts

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:05.340
1.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.740
“Soccer” was once a popular name for Football
in Britain in the sport’s earliest days.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.980
When the rules for the sport were first being
defined, it was named “Association Football”

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.560
to distinguish it from the other forms of
football commonly played.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.000
Within a year of its inception, this got slurred
down to “Assoccer,” after the common practice

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.750
of adding “-er” to nicknames at the time
in Britain.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.000
Very shortly after this, “Assoccer” became
“Soccer,” which remained a semi-popular

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.230
nickname for the sport in Britain until about
a half century ago, along with just “Football.”

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.359
The game initially spread throughout the world
primarily known as “Football.”

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:39.950
However, in countries where other forms of
football (games played on foot rather than

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.829
on horseback) already were dominate, the nickname
“Soccer” was, and in some cases still

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:46.969
is, the preferred name for this reason.

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:47.969
(QF 761)

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:48.969
2.

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:52.550
According to a recent Wall Street Journal
study, the average NFL game features only

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.569
10 minutes and 43 seconds of action.

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:58.249
The rest of the time is spent with commercials,
replays and commentary.

00:00:58.249 --> 00:01:02.579
This makes it possibly the most profitable
10-11 minutes of entertainment in the history

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.250
of sports, particularly if you include the
countless hours spent on sports talk radio

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.320
and TV shows that continue to talk about the
games and teams even in the off-season, all

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.780
the while generating advertising revenue.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:15.820
(QF 780)

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:16.820
3.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.520
Magic Johnson signed a $25 million, 25 year
contract with the Lakers in 1981, the highest

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.330
paying contract in sports history at the time.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.079
This comprised the bulk of his earnings from
his playing career (though of course he didn’t

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:30.550
complete the contract).

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.649
Today, Magic Johnson Enterprises is estimated
to be worth nearly $1 billion, including,

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:41.119
among many other things, owning several fast
food restaurants and 24-Hour Fitness locations…

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.039
which is sort of the perfect scheme if you
think about it.

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:46.090
(QF 607)

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.090
4.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.590
Despite that many in the media claimed the
Seattle Seahawks’ Super Bowl victory was

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.690
the first major professional sporting championship
won by a Seattle based professional team,

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:56.939
this isn’t true at all.

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.960
For starters, in 1917 the Seattle Metropolitans
became the first American team to win the

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:02.960
Stanley Cup.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.580
Further, the 1979 Seattle Super Sonics won
the NBA championship.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:14.870
In more recent memory, the Seattle Storm won
the WNBA championship in 2004 and 2010 . Incidentally,

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.690
the Seattle Metropolitans also played in the
Stanley Cup finals in 1919.

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.400
With the series tied 2-2-1, the finals were
canceled due to the Spanish flu pandemic that

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.709
killed about 3%-5% of the human population,
as well as infecting about 30%.

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:30.940
(QF 743)

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:31.940
5.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.800
During King Edward’s reign (1307-1327),
he had laws passed against the playing of

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.570
various football sports.

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.510
Anyone caught playing any form of football
would be imprisoned, “For as much as there

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.140
is a great noise in the city caused by hustling
over large balls, from which many evils may

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.140
arise…”

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.750
He wasn’t the only British monarch that
hated football sports.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.890
Queen Elizabeth I “had football players
jailed for a week, with follow-up church penance.”

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:05.550
King Henry IV and Henry VIII also passed laws
against football sports.

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:14.269
(QF 771)
