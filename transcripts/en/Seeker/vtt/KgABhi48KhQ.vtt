00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.220
If a star explodes in a distant galaxy and
no one’s around to hear it, does it make

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:05.240
a sound?

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.240
No!

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.309
But it DOES generate a truckload of gravitational
waves!

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:11.430
(We think.)

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:12.490
Hi!

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:18.270
I’m Ian O’Neill, space producer for Discovery
News, and I wanted to take you on a brief

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.730
voyage into what links some of the craziest
cosmic events we know about.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.150
I’m talking about supernovas, black hole
mergers, neutron star collisions, orbiting

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.650
white dwarfs and even the biggest bang of
them all… the Big Bang!

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.019
So what exactly connects them all?

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.100
That’d be gravitational waves; and if you’ve
been paying attention these last few months,

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.469
you’ll know that these wiggles in spacetime
have been insanely hard to find.

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.190
Astronomers using the BICEP2 telescope located
in the South Pole THOUGHT they’d identified

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.809
primordial gravitational waves embedded in
the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:46.809
last year.

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:49.150
Unfortunately, it seems that these signals
may have just been noise.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.800
But that doesn’t mean it’s curtains for
the search for gravitational waves and gravitational

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.010
wave detectors, not by a long shot.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.250
Rather than seeking out ancient gravitational
waves created by the Big Bang, the Laser Interferometer

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.430
Gravitational-Wave Observatory -- or LIGO
-- is ACTIVELY looking for gravitational waves

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.060
passing through Earth right this second!

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.473
These waves were predicted by Einstein and
are a product of his famous theory of general

00:01:09.473 --> 00:01:10.473
relativity.

00:01:10.473 --> 00:01:12.189
In a nutshell, Einstein’s equations predicted
that should a massive object like a black

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:16.970
hole or neutron star suddenly accelerate,
decelerate or collide, energy will be lost.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.880
But in these cosmic scenarios, energy is lost
through powerful ripples in spacetime -- much

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.650
like the ripples that race across the surface
of a pond after a pebble hits the water.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.310
Although there is strong indirect evidence
of their existence, we have yet to spot them

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.310
directly.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.869
This is where LIGO comes in.

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.970
LIGO consists of two stations on opposite
sides of the United States, and it uses a

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.950
highly sensitive method called interferometry
to detect the TINY effect a propagating gravitational

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.479
wave will have on spacetime.

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.099
As gravitational waves wash THROUGH the Earth
-- yes, I said THROUGH, as in through US!

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:50.240
-- there is the tiniest of tiny shrinkage
or expansion in local spacetime.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.750
But for LIGO, which has recently undergone
an upgrade, such a minuscule spacetime warping

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.990
SHOULD be detectable and, since 2002, the
project has been on the lookout.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.500
This thing is so sensitive that it is probing
distances on the smallest scales thought to

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.439
exist in spacetime -- it should be able to
detect a distance change of 10,000th the width

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.690
of a proton.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.800
Although LIGO has yet to see a definitive
signal, it is using a process of elimination,

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.510
ruling out where these waves AREN’T and
physicists are confident they are closing

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.690
in on the first detection in the coming years.

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.140
By firing a split laser down LIGO’s two
perpendicular 4 kilometer-long L-shaped tunnels

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.210
and bouncing those beams many times, an interferometer
can compare the two beams and detect any slight

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:29.540
shifts in frequency.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.030
This tiny shift could represent the passage
of a gravitational wave.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.000
Should that wave be detected by both LIGO
locations, the source of the wave could be

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.340
derived and we could see the beginning of
a new era of gravitational wave astronomy.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.530
Although the LIGO instrumentation uses a complex
system of shock absorbers, magnetic fields

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.950
and sophisticated filters to drown out any
outside interference, the detector is so sensitive

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.970
that it can still pick up false signals from
strong winds or passing vehicles, only making

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.909
this search for a gravitational wave in the
proverbial haystack of noise even harder.

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:03.440
Fortunately this epic quest on the frontier
of scientific discovery isn’t short of some

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.769
great physics minds.

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.520
Students from Caltech recently created a colorful
visualization to connect known interference

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.250
events with their corresponding signal detected
by LIGO, thus eliminating terrestrial noise

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.250
from the continuing search for extraterrestrial
sources of gravitational waves.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.100
But will this be enough to finally tease this
tiny wobble out of the tangled, noisy mess

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.100
of spacetime?

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.250
