serves just to divide people all the
more when Jesus message was about

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760
more when Jesus message was about
 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.230
more when Jesus message was about
bringing us together

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:09.240
bringing us together
 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.469
bringing us together
