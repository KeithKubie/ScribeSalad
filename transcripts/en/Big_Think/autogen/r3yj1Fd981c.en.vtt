emotional place I mean writing a novel
isn't a practical logical thing to do at

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990
isn't a practical logical thing to do at
 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.370
isn't a practical logical thing to do at
all I mean at least not in my case what

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380
all I mean at least not in my case what
 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.040
all I mean at least not in my case what
happens with me is that something's

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050

things that are bothering me and that

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840
things that are bothering me and that
 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.110
things that are bothering me and that
those feelings begin to form an idea for

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120
those feelings begin to form an idea for
 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.389
those feelings begin to form an idea for
a novel and I guess that's because

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399
a novel and I guess that's because
 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.930
a novel and I guess that's because
that's the only way I can or that's the

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940
that's the only way I can or that's the
 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.259
that's the only way I can or that's the
way I like to express myself an artistic

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:45.269
way I like to express myself an artistic
 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:49.189
way I like to express myself an artistic
in an artistic way and so what happens

00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:49.199
in an artistic way and so what happens
 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:51.169
in an artistic way and so what happens
like for example with imperial bedrooms

00:00:51.169 --> 00:00:51.179
like for example with imperial bedrooms
 

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:55.369
like for example with imperial bedrooms
I have reread less than zero and I was

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379
I have reread less than zero and I was
 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.340
I have reread less than zero and I was
thinking about where clay was now and I

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350
thinking about where clay was now and I
 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.349
thinking about where clay was now and I
was also going through a lot of other

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359
was also going through a lot of other
 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.149
was also going through a lot of other
stuff in my life that was kind of

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159
stuff in my life that was kind of
 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.390
stuff in my life that was kind of
painful and confusing and these two

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400
painful and confusing and these two
 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.460
painful and confusing and these two
things came together the idea of where

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470
things came together the idea of where
 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.200
things came together the idea of where
this character was now that I'd written

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210
this character was now that I'd written
 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.630
this character was now that I'd written
about 20 years ago and what was going on

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640
about 20 years ago and what was going on
 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.090
about 20 years ago and what was going on
in my life at that point and then I

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100
in my life at that point and then I
 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.590
in my life at that point and then I
started to have a lot of questions about

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600
started to have a lot of questions about
 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.900
started to have a lot of questions about
that character and this went on for a

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:20.910
that character and this went on for a
 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.410
that character and this went on for a
year so the process begins without

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420
year so the process begins without
 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.000
year so the process begins without
writing anything for about a year when

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010
writing anything for about a year when
 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.290
writing anything for about a year when
I'm just walking around asking questions

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300
I'm just walking around asking questions
 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.620
I'm just walking around asking questions
about this character and what's going on

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630
about this character and what's going on
 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.390
about this character and what's going on
in his life and then I start to make

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400
in his life and then I start to make
 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.060
in his life and then I start to make
notes and then I start to answer some of

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070
notes and then I start to answer some of
 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.310
notes and then I start to answer some of
those questions and then I those notes

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320
those questions and then I those notes
 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.830
those questions and then I those notes
form into an outline and then that

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840
form into an outline and then that
 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.740
form into an outline and then that
outline turns into a novel and that has

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750
outline turns into a novel and that has
 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.710
outline turns into a novel and that has
been my process for just about every

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720
been my process for just about every
 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.310
been my process for just about every
book that I've written

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320
 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.770
I know the last line of the book before

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780
I know the last line of the book before
 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.500
I know the last line of the book before
he actually begin the book yes another

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510
he actually begin the book yes another
 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.990
he actually begin the book yes another
first line under the last line and you

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000
first line under the last line and you
 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.969
first line under the last line and you
know and the idea I've talked about an

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979
know and the idea I've talked about an
 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.830
know and the idea I've talked about an
Outland a lot throughout my career and

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840
Outland a lot throughout my career and
 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.510
Outland a lot throughout my career and
I've talked about how the outlines are

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520
I've talked about how the outlines are
 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.469
I've talked about how the outlines are
often very massive and twice as long as

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479
often very massive and twice as long as
 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.859
often very massive and twice as long as
the texts themselves and I guess I

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869
the texts themselves and I guess I
 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.449
the texts themselves and I guess I
should just be calling those you know

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459
should just be calling those you know
 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.690
should just be calling those you know
first drafts in a way because a lot of

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700
first drafts in a way because a lot of
 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.490
first drafts in a way because a lot of
the novel is in there but there's also a

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500
the novel is in there but there's also a
 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.110
the novel is in there but there's also a
lot of other things in there there are

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120
lot of other things in there there are
 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.850
lot of other things in there there are
questions that are written in the

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860
questions that are written in the
 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.520
questions that are written in the
margins and I answer those questions and

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530
margins and I answer those questions and
 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.170
margins and I answer those questions and
then there are examples of how a

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180
then there are examples of how a
 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.960
then there are examples of how a
paragraph should look and then a note of

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970
paragraph should look and then a note of
 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.760
paragraph should look and then a note of
all the things that this narrator

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770
all the things that this narrator
 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.100
all the things that this narrator
wouldn't notice that I might notice or

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110
wouldn't notice that I might notice or
 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.510
wouldn't notice that I might notice or
you might notice if we were in that

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520
you might notice if we were in that
 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.729
you might notice if we were in that
scene but for example someone like lay

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739
scene but for example someone like lay
 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.220
scene but for example someone like lay
in imperial bedrooms who's this kind of

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230
in imperial bedrooms who's this kind of
 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.250
in imperial bedrooms who's this kind of
entitled raging narcissist would never

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260
entitled raging narcissist would never
 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.140
entitled raging narcissist would never
notice he wouldn't notice that detail in

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150
notice he wouldn't notice that detail in
 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.120
notice he wouldn't notice that detail in
the corner he wouldn't say that thing he

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130
the corner he wouldn't say that thing he
 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.890
the corner he wouldn't say that thing he
wouldn't over here that line of dialogue

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900
wouldn't over here that line of dialogue
 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.160
wouldn't over here that line of dialogue
and so on all of that the reader doesn't

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170
and so on all of that the reader doesn't
 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.560
and so on all of that the reader doesn't
need to see what the reader needs to see

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570
need to see what the reader needs to see
 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.960
need to see what the reader needs to see
more or less is this very pared down

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970
more or less is this very pared down
 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.060
more or less is this very pared down
version of that outline and so that's

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070
version of that outline and so that's
 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.479
version of that outline and so that's
kind of a big part of the process is

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489
kind of a big part of the process is
 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.170
kind of a big part of the process is
taking this very emotion based outline

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180
taking this very emotion based outline
 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.410
taking this very emotion based outline
and then I come in as the cool

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420
and then I come in as the cool
 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.270
and then I come in as the cool
technician and in a very neutral way try

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280
technician and in a very neutral way try
 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.990
technician and in a very neutral way try
to take this outline and shape it into

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000
to take this outline and shape it into
 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.610
to take this outline and shape it into
the context of an all

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620
 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.809
uh it depends on my mood it depends on

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819
uh it depends on my mood it depends on
 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:31.780
uh it depends on my mood it depends on
where I'm at in the novel um it depends

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790
where I'm at in the novel um it depends
 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.970
where I'm at in the novel um it depends
on how well I'm feeling that day uh it

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980
on how well I'm feeling that day uh it
 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.100
on how well I'm feeling that day uh it
depends on a lot of things as the novel

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110
depends on a lot of things as the novel
 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.800
depends on a lot of things as the novel
gets closer to completion the days get

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810
gets closer to completion the days get
 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.559
gets closer to completion the days get
longer and I get more revved up and I'm

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:44.569
longer and I get more revved up and I'm
 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:47.770
longer and I get more revved up and I'm
more excited but the whole process I
