00:00:00.167 --> 00:00:01.828
 Many times we have seen that 

00:00:01.828 --> 00:00:04.051
 glycolysis is a process, 

00:00:04.051 --> 00:00:06.125
 where we start with glucose, 

00:00:06.125 --> 00:00:08.709
 which has six carbon atoms, and breaks it down 

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:10.662
 up to two pyruvate molecules 

00:00:10.662 --> 00:00:12.520
 each of which has three carbon atoms. 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.086
 In this process 

00:00:14.086 --> 00:00:17.497
 two ATP molecules are produced in total 

00:00:17.497 --> 00:00:21.464
 and NAD + is reduced to NAD. 

00:00:21.464 --> 00:00:25.833
 We add a hydride anion, 

00:00:25.833 --> 00:00:29.321
 so this is a reduction. 

00:00:29.321 --> 00:00:30.839
 - 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:33.102
 Of course, we also produced water 

00:00:33.102 --> 00:00:34.818
 and hydrogen ions. 

00:00:34.818 --> 00:00:36.977
 But the next question is - what happens next? 

00:00:36.977 --> 00:00:39.662
 We can talk about cellular breathing, 

00:00:39.662 --> 00:00:42.227
 it occurs in many organisms. 

00:00:42.227 --> 00:00:44.038
 It happens in your body right now, 

00:00:44.038 --> 00:00:46.719
 so you can produce as many ATP as possible. 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:48.240
 That's why we're moving oxygen. 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.247
 Because oxygen is needed for cellular respiration. 

00:00:51.247 --> 00:00:53.699
 But sometimes there is no oxygen 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.040
 or I may be an organism that does not use oxygen 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.629
 or does not perform cellular respiration. 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:01.795
 We have already seen an example of this 

00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:04.876
 and that was the lactic acid fermentation. 

00:01:04.876 --> 00:01:08.760
 This is a way to recycle NADN molecules, 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.460
 they are oxidized again. 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.317
 They are oxidized and once again converted to NAD +. 

00:01:13.317 --> 00:01:15.491
 This is oxidation, 

00:01:15.491 --> 00:01:19.845
 converting NAD to NAD +. 

00:01:19.845 --> 00:01:21.941
 It happens during fermentation. 

00:01:21.941 --> 00:01:23.915
 In fact, for both types of fermentation, 

00:01:23.915 --> 00:01:25.320
 which we will talk about. 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.514
 In the lactic acid fermentation we talked about 

00:01:27.514 --> 00:01:31.043
 that pyruvate oxidizes NADH 

00:01:31.043 --> 00:01:33.562
 and thus the pyruvate is converted to lactic acid. 

00:01:33.562 --> 00:01:37.254
 It is used to make yoghurt, sauerkraut, 

00:01:37.254 --> 00:01:38.775
 it is also used in muscles, 

00:01:38.775 --> 00:01:40.713
 when they do not have oxygen. 

00:01:40.713 --> 00:01:42.582
 If you sprint or lift 

00:01:42.582 --> 00:01:44.022
 very, very heavy weights, 

00:01:44.022 --> 00:01:48.040
 you may have lactic-acidic fermentation in your muscles. 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.152
 But now we will talk about another kind of fermentation, 

00:01:50.152 --> 00:01:53.054
 this is alcoholic fermentation. 

00:01:53.054 --> 00:01:54.912
 Alcohol. 

00:01:54.912 --> 00:01:59.065
 Alcoholic fermentation. 

00:01:59.065 --> 00:02:00.716
 - 

00:02:00.716 --> 00:02:02.515
 When we talk about drinking alcohol, 

00:02:02.515 --> 00:02:04.117
 we are talking about ethanol. 

00:02:04.117 --> 00:02:06.182
 Some also call it ethanol 

00:02:06.182 --> 00:02:09.622
 fermentation. 

00:02:09.622 --> 00:02:12.151
 As you can guess, it's a process, 

00:02:12.151 --> 00:02:15.239
 which is used in the production of alcohol, but also of other things like bread. 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:16.771
 It's used pretty much in baking. 

00:02:16.771 --> 00:02:18.478
 But think about the reaction 

00:02:18.478 --> 00:02:19.778
 and then we will talk 

00:02:19.778 --> 00:02:22.274
 about where you last met her. 

00:02:22.274 --> 00:02:24.340
 - 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.790
 When glycolysis is complete, 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.891
 of each glucose molecule 

00:02:28.891 --> 00:02:30.598
 we get two pyruvate molecules. 

00:02:30.598 --> 00:02:32.954
 So at the first step 

00:02:32.954 --> 00:02:36.890
 each of these molecules loses its carboxyl group. 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.270
 This process is helped 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.777
 of pyruvate decarboxylase. 

00:02:41.777 --> 00:02:43.694
 The name of the enzyme means that it is 

00:02:43.694 --> 00:02:45.771
 cleaves the carboxyl group. 

00:02:45.771 --> 00:02:47.651
 You see that when we remove the carboxyl group, 

00:02:47.651 --> 00:02:49.277
 it consists of one carbon and two oxygen atoms, 

00:02:49.277 --> 00:02:50.995
 I will not show the detailed mechanism, 

00:02:50.995 --> 00:02:52.794
 but it will 

00:02:52.794 --> 00:02:55.371
 carbon dioxide, 

00:02:55.371 --> 00:02:58.819
 who will separate himself. 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:59.986
 And the rest, 

00:02:59.986 --> 00:03:02.640
 I will not again show the mechanism, 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.913
 but the rest will be acetaldehyde, 

00:03:05.913 --> 00:03:09.413
 you can pay attention to some of the atoms that build it. 

00:03:09.413 --> 00:03:12.048
 Acetaldehyde, I find it hard to pronounce it. 

00:03:12.048 --> 00:03:13.268
 In the next step 

00:03:13.268 --> 00:03:16.448
 the acetaldehyde may be reduced. 

00:03:16.448 --> 00:03:17.435
 We can assume, 

00:03:17.435 --> 00:03:20.975
 that it is reduced by NADN 

00:03:20.975 --> 00:03:22.833
 and converted to ethanol. 

00:03:22.833 --> 00:03:24.088
 The mechanism is similar 

00:03:24.088 --> 00:03:26.050
 to the one we saw in lactic acid fermentation, 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.497
 where from pyruvate we received lactic acid. 

00:03:28.497 --> 00:03:31.551
 However, acetaldehyde is converted to ethanol. 

00:03:31.551 --> 00:03:33.933
 This here 

00:03:33.933 --> 00:03:37.735
 is reduced. 

00:03:37.735 --> 00:03:38.807
 Reduced, 

00:03:38.807 --> 00:03:40.944
 receives a hydride anion. 

00:03:40.944 --> 00:03:42.069
 We can say, 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:45.286
 that he gains a hydride anion, 

00:03:45.286 --> 00:03:47.908
 at the reduction pathway of this molecule, 

00:03:47.908 --> 00:03:50.591
 NON is oxidized. 

00:03:50.591 --> 00:03:54.666
 This is oxidized. 

00:03:54.666 --> 00:03:55.803
 The main purpose of all this process, 

00:03:55.803 --> 00:03:57.068
 the reason for it to happen 

00:03:57.068 --> 00:03:59.053
 is the oxidation of NADH, 

00:03:59.053 --> 00:04:04.053
 to get a new NAD + for the next glycolysis. 

00:04:04.173 --> 00:04:06.692
 As I mentioned in the video about lactic acid, 

00:04:06.692 --> 00:04:08.004
 this is a little unfortunate, 

00:04:08.004 --> 00:04:11.161
 because pyruvate also contains energy. 

00:04:11.161 --> 00:04:12.264
 If we had oxygen, 

00:04:12.264 --> 00:04:13.426
 we could have cellular breathing 

00:04:13.426 --> 00:04:14.621
 and the Krebs cycle, 

00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:16.009
 citric acid cycle 

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:17.709
 and get energy from it. 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.844
 The oxidation process of NADN 

00:04:20.844 --> 00:04:23.490
 in theory can create more energy. 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:24.605
 But with none of the fermentation types, 

00:04:24.605 --> 00:04:26.369
 this does not happen. 

00:04:26.369 --> 00:04:27.704
 Nor does it happen with alcohol, 

00:04:27.704 --> 00:04:31.223
 nor in lactic acid fermentation. 

00:04:31.223 --> 00:04:32.870
 However, these are processes, 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.368
 which have always been very useful for human civilization. 

00:04:36.368 --> 00:04:39.012
 When talking about alcohol fermentation, 

00:04:39.012 --> 00:04:41.926
 the most famous 

00:04:41.926 --> 00:04:45.501
 a participant in it is here. 

00:04:45.501 --> 00:04:47.800
 These are yeasts. 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.818
 They are classified as mushrooms. 

00:04:50.818 --> 00:04:52.258
 This is a yeast cell. 

00:04:52.258 --> 00:04:55.543
 Its diameter is several micrometres, 

00:04:55.543 --> 00:04:56.901
 but it may vary. 

00:04:56.901 --> 00:04:58.446
 Different types of yeast are used 

00:04:58.446 --> 00:05:02.207
 the production of bread and wine, 

00:05:02.207 --> 00:05:03.437
 or in the production of alcohol. 

00:05:03.437 --> 00:05:05.259
 Also in beer production. 

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:07.123
 Yeast 

00:05:07.123 --> 00:05:11.096
 digest sugar by glycolysis 

00:05:11.096 --> 00:05:13.563
 and then alcoholic fermentation takes place there. 

00:05:13.563 --> 00:05:16.776
 And what makes the bread roll up is this step here. 

00:05:16.776 --> 00:05:20.886
 When the carboxyl group is removed from the pyruvate, 

00:05:20.886 --> 00:05:23.382
 this is assisted by pyruvate decarboxylase, 

00:05:23.382 --> 00:05:25.425
 carbon dioxide is released, 

00:05:25.425 --> 00:05:26.842
 who makes the bread fluffy. 

00:05:26.842 --> 00:05:28.281
 Carbon dioxide creates bubbles in the dough 

00:05:28.281 --> 00:05:31.015
 and gives it a pleasant taste and texture. 

00:05:31.015 --> 00:05:32.843
 In addition, ethanol is also produced. 

00:05:32.843 --> 00:05:34.171
 An interesting fact is that 

00:05:34.171 --> 00:05:35.803
 - 

00:05:35.803 --> 00:05:36.941
 - 

00:05:36.941 --> 00:05:39.514
 - 

00:05:39.514 --> 00:05:41.329
 in bread usually 

00:05:41.329 --> 00:05:44.799
 there are traces of alcohol. 

00:05:44.799 --> 00:05:47.289
 Bread contains 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:49.470
 traces of ethanol, 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:50.630
 because to make it 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.173
 yeast is used. 

00:05:53.173 --> 00:05:54.858
 To make it soft and swell, 

00:05:54.858 --> 00:05:56.706
 glycolysis occurs in yeast 

00:05:56.706 --> 00:05:59.430
 and the alcoholic fermentation in which they are produced 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:00.905
 ethanol and carbon dioxide. 

00:06:00.905 --> 00:06:02.926
 So the bread swells, 

00:06:02.926 --> 00:06:07.163
 but there are traces of ethanol in it. 

00:06:07.163 --> 00:06:08.961
 But if we talk about wine, 

00:06:08.961 --> 00:06:12.437
 the goal is to produce ethanol, 

00:06:12.437 --> 00:06:15.625
 which we see as traditional drinking alcohol. 

00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:20.625
 So yeasts play a very important role in people's societies.
