00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.540
So if we take a look at the ABO

00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:04.240
mRNA here, we can tell it's much shorter, and it's

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.100
composed of the purple segments, or the really small

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.650
segments. Both of those are identifiers here. So, if it's

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.910
kept in the mRNA, then it's an exon. Introns

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.430
are actually cut out. So the introns must be these

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.000
big Orange regions here. And, these other orange regions

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.300
over here. Outside of teh gene entirely in the dash

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.060
region is completely somewhere else in the DNA.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.460
And, this purple region here is just another axon.
