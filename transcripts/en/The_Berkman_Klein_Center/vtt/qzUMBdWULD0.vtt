00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
I'm James Wahutu. I'm a PhD candidate from the University of
Minnesota and I'm affiliated with

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.510
the University of Minnesota's Center for
Holocaust and Genocide Studies. This year

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.210
I'm interested in two research questions.
The first is on the use of images of

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.710
atrocities by news organizations.
Primarily, I'm interested in the efficacy

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:26.640
of this and then idea that we could
consume African death and pain while

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.140
sitting in the confines of our home. So what does that then mean for

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.540
African victims and why is it okay to do
this? But most importantly, who owns these

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.910
pictures of African pain and what does
that then mean for advocacy issues? The

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.390
next one that I'm also interested in
and should be starting to act on in the

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:52.890
spring, is the use of perpetrators as
sources when news is being written and

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.780
news is being collected. So, I'm interested
in the relationship between quoting a

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.520
perpetrator of a mass atrocity and the
risk of the intensification of violence.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.950
In my prior work it turns out that
perpetrators are pretty media savvy and

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.990
they know that if a Western news
organization quotes them, it gives them

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.280
the kind of cultural capital that they
need that they then hope to change into

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.840
economic capital during negotiation
processes and hopefully score a seat in

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.579
the new regime and the new government
that should be coming up. It's important for us as Africans

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:34.650
to be able to tell our stories, but also
realize who is telling our stories,

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.119
because whoever is telling our story
owns that particular story. In my

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:45.299
undergrad career, I realized that I
kept quoting Western academics that

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.439
were writing about atrocities in
African countries, but not necessarily

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.060
talking to Africans. The challenge is in changing how we

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.200
raise awareness about mass atrocities
and thinking about

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.700
the unintended consequences of how
we've been doing it thus far.
