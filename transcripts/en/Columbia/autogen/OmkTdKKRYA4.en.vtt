these things what if because I think

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580
these things what if because I think
 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.410
these things what if because I think
that this idea that the kinds of the

process scientific processes and

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:48.980
process scientific processes and
 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.010
process scientific processes and
artistic processes have many many

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.020
artistic processes have many many
 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.260
artistic processes have many many
similarities and how historically I

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.270
similarities and how historically I

experimental processes so I want to do a

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.110
experimental processes so I want to do a
 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:04.750

um digital art you know this is a

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:30.470
um digital art you know this is a
 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:33.280
um digital art you know this is a
challenging field so so why is it

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:33.290
challenging field so so why is it

this kind of relationship every day so
 

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:23.720
this kind of relationship every day so
I'm very interested in this digital it

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:23.730
I'm very interested in this digital it

digital artists kind of this strange

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:33.420
digital artists kind of this strange
 

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:34.700
digital artists kind of this strange
thing when I was in school I studied

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:34.710
thing when I was in school I studied
 

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:37.550
thing when I was in school I studied
filmmaking I did a vanguard kind of

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:37.560
filmmaking I did a vanguard kind of
 

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.560
filmmaking I did a vanguard kind of
experimental film and audio work and

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:39.570
experimental film and audio work and
 

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:44.330

there was no cultural industry you know

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:44.340
there was no cultural industry you know
 

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:47.870

in the same way we didn't have a big MTV

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:47.880
in the same way we didn't have a big MTV
 

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.720
in the same way we didn't have a big MTV
was not quite the same to a video artist

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:50.730
was not quite the same to a video artist
 

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:53.140
was not quite the same to a video artist
as something like the software industry

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:53.150
as something like the software industry
 

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:56.510
as something like the software industry
but I think so so digital artists are

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:56.520
but I think so so digital artists are
 

00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:01.990
but I think so so digital artists are
kind of working amidst this ubiquitous

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:02.000

00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:32.640
has these wonderfully abstract virtual
 

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:35.390
has these wonderfully abstract virtual
environments and you actually wear and

00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:35.400
environments and you actually wear and
 

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:41.600
environments and you actually wear and
kind of a vest and the the program

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:41.610
kind of a vest and the the program
 

00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:43.010
kind of a vest and the the program
actually tracks your breathing and how

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:43.020
actually tracks your breathing and how
 

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:44.480
actually tracks your breathing and how
you navigate around in the space is

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:44.490
you navigate around in the space is
 

00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:46.070
you navigate around in the space is
actually by your breath and by your

00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.080
actually by your breath and by your
 

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:48.470
actually by your breath and by your
balance and not through saying run here

00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:48.480
balance and not through saying run here
 

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:50.570
balance and not through saying run here
go here and so you kind of float in and

00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:50.580
go here and so you kind of float in and
 

00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:52.580
go here and so you kind of float in and
go through this process and many people

00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:52.590
go through this process and many people
 

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:56.480
go through this process and many people
who go into these worlds have you know

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:56.490
who go into these worlds have you know
 

00:23:56.490 --> 00:23:57.980
who go into these worlds have you know
they've come out crying and they it's

00:23:57.980 --> 00:23:57.990
they've come out crying and they it's
 

00:23:57.990 --> 00:23:59.750
they've come out crying and they it's
it's a head-mounted display kind of kind

00:23:59.750 --> 00:23:59.760
it's a head-mounted display kind of kind
 

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:02.720
it's a head-mounted display kind of kind
of VR experience and here's some images

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:02.730
of VR experience and here's some images
 

00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:06.140
of VR experience and here's some images
she has two of them Osmos an FM air from

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:06.150
she has two of them Osmos an FM air from
 

00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:10.160
she has two of them Osmos an FM air from
the 90s and so I mean one of the things

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:10.170
the 90s and so I mean one of the things
 

00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:11.690
the 90s and so I mean one of the things
I think that if you would want to look

00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:11.700
I think that if you would want to look
 

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:13.340
I think that if you would want to look
at this idea of experimentation David

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:13.350
at this idea of experimentation David
 

00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:15.260
at this idea of experimentation David
wrote me saying okay well what if what

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:15.270
wrote me saying okay well what if what
 

00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:16.340
wrote me saying okay well what if what
if computers had this kind of

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:16.350
if computers had this kind of
 

00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:18.110
if computers had this kind of
consciousness that could that could name

00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:18.120
consciousness that could that could name
 

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:19.610
consciousness that could that could name
things I could recognize things you know

00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:19.620
things I could recognize things you know
 

00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:22.340
things I could recognize things you know
what is that relationship between that

00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:22.350
what is that relationship between that
 

00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:25.220
what is that relationship between that
and I mean it's very easy to see is

00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:25.230
and I mean it's very easy to see is
 

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:27.020
and I mean it's very easy to see is
looking at ideas about God as well as

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:27.030
looking at ideas about God as well as
 

00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:29.720
looking at ideas about God as well as
about human power and I think that the

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:29.730
about human power and I think that the
 

00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:31.280
about human power and I think that the
work of Shar Davies is very different

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:31.290
work of Shar Davies is very different
 

00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:33.830
work of Shar Davies is very different
it's looking at the physical experience

00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:33.840
it's looking at the physical experience
 

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:36.110
it's looking at the physical experience
of being in in a world in some kind of

00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:36.120
of being in in a world in some kind of
 

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:38.930
of being in in a world in some kind of
world maybe of artificial world and is

00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:38.940
world maybe of artificial world and is
 

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:41.180
world maybe of artificial world and is
that as compelling or more so than the

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:41.190
that as compelling or more so than the
 

00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:43.760
that as compelling or more so than the
physical world we have around us there's

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:43.770
physical world we have around us there's
 

00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:45.620
physical world we have around us there's
some more images of Ruth

work called evolve which is the little

00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:55.260
work called evolve which is the little
 

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:57.890
work called evolve which is the little
creatures and in a pool that that

00:24:57.890 --> 00:24:57.900
creatures and in a pool that that
 

00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:59.930
creatures and in a pool that that
evolved and based on where users kind of

00:24:59.930 --> 00:24:59.940
evolved and based on where users kind of

it's a literally like a liquid pool like
 

00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:04.490
it's a literally like a liquid pool like
a pool of and users can kind of reach

00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:04.500
a pool of and users can kind of reach
 

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:06.409
a pool of and users can kind of reach
out and the creatures their virtual

00:25:06.409 --> 00:25:06.419
out and the creatures their virtual
 

00:25:06.419 --> 00:25:07.730
out and the creatures their virtual
creatures that are projected into the

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:07.740
creatures that are projected into the
 

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:11.000
creatures that are projected into the
pool they change and grow through

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:11.010
pool they change and grow through
 

00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:13.669

this work is actually up in Boston right

00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:18.240
this work is actually up in Boston right
 

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:22.690
this work is actually up in Boston right
now I've heard that there's a of that

00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:22.700
 

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:24.620
this work I think is really interesting

00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:24.630
this work I think is really interesting
 

00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:31.039
this work I think is really interesting

Nakamura did this project which I think

00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:34.200
Nakamura did this project which I think
 

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:36.529
Nakamura did this project which I think
I I think this project is one of the

00:25:36.529 --> 00:25:36.539
I I think this project is one of the
 

00:25:36.539 --> 00:25:39.159
I I think this project is one of the
projects that has influenced me the most

00:25:39.159 --> 00:25:39.169
projects that has influenced me the most
 

00:25:39.169 --> 00:25:43.430
projects that has influenced me the most
in the last five years and I'm not

00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:43.440
in the last five years and I'm not
 

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:45.110
in the last five years and I'm not
exactly sure why but I'll describe it

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:45.120
exactly sure why but I'll describe it
 

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:48.230
exactly sure why but I'll describe it
that the bird was located in Kentucky

00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:48.240
that the bird was located in Kentucky
 

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:50.240
that the bird was located in Kentucky
and the bird would sing and the plant

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:50.250
and the bird would sing and the plant
 

00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:52.279
and the bird would sing and the plant
would would they did this over phone

00:25:52.279 --> 00:25:52.289
would would they did this over phone
 

00:25:52.289 --> 00:25:55.700
would would they did this over phone
lines the plant would listen to the

00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:55.710
lines the plant would listen to the
 

00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:58.310
lines the plant would listen to the
birds music in New York through the

00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320
birds music in New York through the
 

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:01.039
birds music in New York through the
speaker and then there are little bio

00:26:01.039 --> 00:26:01.049
speaker and then there are little bio
 

00:26:01.049 --> 00:26:03.320
speaker and then there are little bio
feedback mechanisms put on the leaves of

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:03.330
feedback mechanisms put on the leaves of
 

00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:06.919
feedback mechanisms put on the leaves of
the plant and the that would also feed

00:26:06.919 --> 00:26:06.929
the plant and the that would also feed
 

00:26:06.929 --> 00:26:08.600
the plant and the that would also feed
into a computer which processed the

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:08.610
into a computer which processed the
 

00:26:08.610 --> 00:26:10.940
into a computer which processed the
audio from the bird with the feedback of

00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:10.950
audio from the bird with the feedback of
 

00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:12.799
audio from the bird with the feedback of
the plant and sent it back to the bird

00:26:12.799 --> 00:26:12.809
the plant and sent it back to the bird
 

00:26:12.809 --> 00:26:16.130
the plant and sent it back to the bird
who responded back to the plants and

00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:16.140
who responded back to the plants and
 

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:18.140
who responded back to the plants and
there's this loop and I don't know how

00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:18.150
there's this loop and I don't know how
 

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:19.549
there's this loop and I don't know how
long they had it going because it really

00:26:19.549 --> 00:26:19.559
long they had it going because it really
 

00:26:19.559 --> 00:26:21.470
long they had it going because it really
uh you know ran on a phone they actually

00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:21.480
uh you know ran on a phone they actually
 

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:23.570
uh you know ran on a phone they actually
called I don't think it was even really

00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:23.580
called I don't think it was even really
 

00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:26.270
called I don't think it was even really
doing much like modem I think it was a

00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:26.280
doing much like modem I think it was a
 

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:32.539
doing much like modem I think it was a
phone call but it was not it was not

00:26:32.539 --> 00:26:32.549
phone call but it was not it was not
 

00:26:32.549 --> 00:26:36.440
phone call but it was not it was not
visual it was it was audio mm-hm

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:36.450
visual it was it was audio mm-hm
 

00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:39.710
visual it was it was audio mm-hm
and there's just something for me

00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:39.720
and there's just something for me
 

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:40.970
and there's just something for me
there's something really magical about

00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:40.980
there's something really magical about
 

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:42.980
there's something really magical about
this system that evolved and changed and

this system that evolved and changed and
 

00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:46.190
this system that evolved and changed and
had really at some point very very few

key the key part of this piece of course
 

00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:53.539
key the key part of this piece of course
is how are you making that translation

00:26:53.539 --> 00:26:53.549
is how are you making that translation

is how are you making that translation
how are you interpreting the data which

00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:56.070
how are you interpreting the data which
 

00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:57.680
how are you interpreting the data which
is kind of a scientific question too if

00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:57.690
is kind of a scientific question too if
 

00:26:57.690 --> 00:26:59.180
is kind of a scientific question too if
you are doing a scientific

why are you interpreting the data from
 

00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:02.300
why are you interpreting the data from
the plant and giving it meaning how are

00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:02.310
the plant and giving it meaning how are
 

00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:05.930
the plant and giving it meaning how are
you putting that into some like

00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:05.940
you putting that into some like
 

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:08.930
you putting that into some like
processor or sampler and and seeing what

really is an arbitrary choice and and
 

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:23.600
really is an arbitrary choice and and
how do you do that let's say you're

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:23.610
how do you do that let's say you're

you're mapping a windstorm how do you

00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:26.520
you're mapping a windstorm how do you
 

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:28.340
you're mapping a windstorm how do you
know that wind speed should equal

00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:28.350
know that wind speed should equal
 

00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:30.620
know that wind speed should equal
velocity so this mapping process that is

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:30.630
velocity so this mapping process that is
 

00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:32.840
velocity so this mapping process that is
a scientific question also is a really

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:32.850

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:12.410
but there sometimes it is so so this way
 

00:31:12.410 --> 00:31:14.860
but there sometimes it is so so this way
that that we can kind of get back to the

00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:14.870
that that we can kind of get back to the
 

00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:17.320
that that we can kind of get back to the
what is what is our experience in the

00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:17.330
what is what is our experience in the
 

00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:19.870
what is what is our experience in the
everyday and that's when I start looking

00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:19.880
everyday and that's when I start looking
 

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:22.090
everyday and that's when I start looking
at the computer because I my question is

00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:22.100
at the computer because I my question is
 

00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:22.659
at the computer because I my question is
okay I

00:31:22.659 --> 00:31:22.669
okay I
 

00:31:22.669 --> 00:31:25.180
okay I
sit in front of a computer every day 54%

00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:25.190
sit in front of a computer every day 54%
 

00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:26.649
sit in front of a computer every day 54%
of Americans have computers at home and

00:31:26.649 --> 00:31:26.659
of Americans have computers at home and
 

00:31:26.659 --> 00:31:31.029
of Americans have computers at home and
use them over four hours a week so many

00:31:31.029 --> 00:31:31.039
use them over four hours a week so many
 

00:31:31.039 --> 00:31:32.680
use them over four hours a week so many
of us have the experience of sitting in

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:32.690
of us have the experience of sitting in
 

00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:34.210
of us have the experience of sitting in
front of a computer every day so what is

00:31:34.210 --> 00:31:34.220
front of a computer every day so what is
 

00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:36.989
front of a computer every day so what is
this experience how can we look at this

00:31:36.989 --> 00:31:36.999
this experience how can we look at this
 

00:31:36.999 --> 00:31:40.840
this experience how can we look at this
relationship and we could just one time

00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:40.850
relationship and we could just one time
 

00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:42.820
relationship and we could just one time
I did this virtual performance piece and

00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:42.830
I did this virtual performance piece and
 

00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:46.019
I did this virtual performance piece and
at the in some University in Georgia and

00:31:46.019 --> 00:31:46.029
at the in some University in Georgia and
 

00:31:46.029 --> 00:31:48.759
at the in some University in Georgia and
several faculty mean it was a virtual

00:31:48.759 --> 00:31:48.769
several faculty mean it was a virtual
 

00:31:48.769 --> 00:31:50.169
several faculty mean it was a virtual
performance piece I had to perform this

00:31:50.169 --> 00:31:50.179
performance piece I had to perform this
 

00:31:50.179 --> 00:31:53.259
performance piece I had to perform this
stuff in this 3d space and I used a

00:31:53.259 --> 00:31:53.269
stuff in this 3d space and I used a
 

00:31:53.269 --> 00:31:55.810
stuff in this 3d space and I used a
mouse and the faculty member came up to

00:31:55.810 --> 00:31:55.820
mouse and the faculty member came up to
 

00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:56.979
mouse and the faculty member came up to
me afterwards he was a performance

00:31:56.979 --> 00:31:56.989
me afterwards he was a performance
 

00:31:56.989 --> 00:31:59.169
me afterwards he was a performance
studies faculty and he said that wasn't

00:31:59.169 --> 00:31:59.179
studies faculty and he said that wasn't
 

00:31:59.179 --> 00:32:01.029
studies faculty and he said that wasn't
a performance that was not a performance

00:32:01.029 --> 00:32:01.039
a performance that was not a performance
 

00:32:01.039 --> 00:32:04.299
a performance that was not a performance
and I said well it was there are other

00:32:04.299 --> 00:32:04.309
and I said well it was there are other
 

00:32:04.309 --> 00:32:05.499
and I said well it was there are other
people in the space we were all

00:32:05.499 --> 00:32:05.509
people in the space we were all
 

00:32:05.509 --> 00:32:07.570
people in the space we were all
interacting we have we have dialogue and

00:32:07.570 --> 00:32:07.580
interacting we have we have dialogue and
 

00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:09.249
interacting we have we have dialogue and
lines and sound happening and all this

00:32:09.249 --> 00:32:09.259
lines and sound happening and all this
 

00:32:09.259 --> 00:32:11.590
lines and sound happening and all this
stuff and he said no it wasn't all you

00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:11.600
stuff and he said no it wasn't all you
 

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:17.619
stuff and he said no it wasn't all you
were doing was this and I realize you

00:32:17.619 --> 00:32:17.629
were doing was this and I realize you
 

00:32:17.629 --> 00:32:19.539
were doing was this and I realize you
know wow there's there's some serious

00:32:19.539 --> 00:32:19.549
know wow there's there's some serious
 

00:32:19.549 --> 00:32:22.509
know wow there's there's some serious
gaps between how but but then what is

00:32:22.509 --> 00:32:22.519
gaps between how but but then what is
 

00:32:22.519 --> 00:32:24.849
gaps between how but but then what is
that happen let's talk about that you

00:32:24.849 --> 00:32:24.859
that happen let's talk about that you
 

00:32:24.859 --> 00:32:26.739
that happen let's talk about that you
know like what is that you know if my

00:32:26.739 --> 00:32:26.749
know like what is that you know if my
 

00:32:26.749 --> 00:32:29.139
know like what is that you know if my
daily experience with other people is

00:32:29.139 --> 00:32:29.149
daily experience with other people is
 

00:32:29.149 --> 00:32:32.049
daily experience with other people is
this kind of it is strange they have to

00:32:32.049 --> 00:32:32.059
this kind of it is strange they have to
 

00:32:32.059 --> 00:32:34.659
this kind of it is strange they have to
say I want to look at that in depth and

00:32:34.659 --> 00:32:34.669
say I want to look at that in depth and
 

00:32:34.669 --> 00:32:38.470
say I want to look at that in depth and
so the first kind of this is some

00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:38.480
so the first kind of this is some
 

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:39.909
so the first kind of this is some
virtual performance stuff I used to do a

00:32:39.909 --> 00:32:39.919
virtual performance stuff I used to do a
 

00:32:39.919 --> 00:32:43.659
virtual performance stuff I used to do a
lot of VRML pieces this a lot of my

00:32:43.659 --> 00:32:43.669
lot of VRML pieces this a lot of my
 

00:32:43.669 --> 00:32:45.789
lot of VRML pieces this a lot of my
early work work kind of everyday stories

00:32:45.789 --> 00:32:45.799
early work work kind of everyday stories
 

00:32:45.799 --> 00:32:48.580
early work work kind of everyday stories
and I worked for a while in the software

00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:48.590
and I worked for a while in the software
 

00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:51.430
and I worked for a while in the software
industry and I wanted to I wanted to

00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:51.440
industry and I wanted to I wanted to
 

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:54.129
industry and I wanted to I wanted to
just get out of the whole high tech

00:32:54.129 --> 00:32:54.139
just get out of the whole high tech
 

00:32:54.139 --> 00:32:55.930
just get out of the whole high tech
thing and say okay what are real people

00:32:55.930 --> 00:32:55.940
thing and say okay what are real people
 

00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:56.889
thing and say okay what are real people
doing with this stuff

00:32:56.889 --> 00:32:56.899
doing with this stuff
 

00:32:56.899 --> 00:33:00.369
doing with this stuff
I don't read stories about old women for

00:33:00.369 --> 00:33:00.379
I don't read stories about old women for
 

00:33:00.379 --> 00:33:03.279
I don't read stories about old women for
example online you know I don't read

00:33:03.279 --> 00:33:03.289
example online you know I don't read
 

00:33:03.289 --> 00:33:05.710
example online you know I don't read
stories I don't find this materials

00:33:05.710 --> 00:33:05.720
stories I don't find this materials
 

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:07.180
stories I don't find this materials
right so I made a piece about my

00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:07.190
right so I made a piece about my
 

00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:10.320
right so I made a piece about my
grandmother who was in the hospital and

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:10.330
grandmother who was in the hospital and
 

00:33:10.330 --> 00:33:12.639
grandmother who was in the hospital and
it's called the perpetual bed and it's

00:33:12.639 --> 00:33:12.649
it's called the perpetual bed and it's
 

00:33:12.649 --> 00:33:14.560
it's called the perpetual bed and it's
this three dimensional thermal

00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:14.570
this three dimensional thermal
 

00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:16.239
this three dimensional thermal
environment one of the reasons I'm not

00:33:16.239 --> 00:33:16.249
environment one of the reasons I'm not
 

00:33:16.249 --> 00:33:18.340
environment one of the reasons I'm not
showing it live is because it's a verbal

00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:18.350
showing it live is because it's a verbal
 

00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:21.009
showing it live is because it's a verbal
environment and VRML virtual reality

00:33:21.009 --> 00:33:21.019
environment and VRML virtual reality
 

00:33:21.019 --> 00:33:22.930
environment and VRML virtual reality
reality modeling language is really an

00:33:22.930 --> 00:33:22.940
reality modeling language is really an
 

00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:26.369
reality modeling language is really an
unstable lost in some ways technology

00:33:26.369 --> 00:33:26.379
unstable lost in some ways technology
 

00:33:26.379 --> 00:33:30.519
unstable lost in some ways technology
especially on the Mac and which brings

00:33:30.519 --> 00:33:30.529
especially on the Mac and which brings
 

00:33:30.529 --> 00:33:32.499
especially on the Mac and which brings
up kind of an interesting point maybe

00:33:32.499 --> 00:33:32.509
up kind of an interesting point maybe
 

00:33:32.509 --> 00:33:34.629
up kind of an interesting point maybe
this is more like performance than we

00:33:34.629 --> 00:33:34.639
this is more like performance than we
 

00:33:34.639 --> 00:33:36.580
this is more like performance than we
even thought if we if it

00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:36.590
even thought if we if it
 

00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:39.820
even thought if we if it
through documentation and scores and it

00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:39.830
through documentation and scores and it
 

00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:43.029
through documentation and scores and it
kind of a question I want spend that

00:33:43.029 --> 00:33:43.039
kind of a question I want spend that
 

00:33:43.039 --> 00:33:44.320
kind of a question I want spend that
much time on the early work so we can

00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:44.330
much time on the early work so we can
 

00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:46.600
much time on the early work so we can
get to seeing some some of the more

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:46.610
get to seeing some some of the more
 

00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:49.680
get to seeing some some of the more
interactive stuff but I've done some

00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:49.690
 

00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:51.909
physical installations looking at the

00:33:51.909 --> 00:33:51.919
physical installations looking at the
 

00:33:51.919 --> 00:33:54.879
physical installations looking at the
space looking looking at physical space

00:33:54.879 --> 00:33:54.889
space looking looking at physical space
 

00:33:54.889 --> 00:33:56.710
space looking looking at physical space
if I'm making virtual spaces how can I

00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:56.720
if I'm making virtual spaces how can I
 

00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:59.220
if I'm making virtual spaces how can I
look at physical space and and explore

00:33:59.220 --> 00:33:59.230
look at physical space and and explore
 

00:33:59.230 --> 00:34:02.139
look at physical space and and explore
issues so this is a installation where

00:34:02.139 --> 00:34:02.149
issues so this is a installation where
 

00:34:02.149 --> 00:34:04.060
issues so this is a installation where
you walk towards these kind of

00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:04.070
you walk towards these kind of
 

00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:05.769
you walk towards these kind of
stereotypical images of women in

00:34:05.769 --> 00:34:05.779
stereotypical images of women in
 

00:34:05.779 --> 00:34:08.230
stereotypical images of women in
corporate America women at work and they

00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:08.240
corporate America women at work and they
 

00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:10.180
corporate America women at work and they
start to blur out when you approach them

00:34:10.180 --> 00:34:10.190
start to blur out when you approach them
 

00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:12.609
start to blur out when you approach them
but if you kind of backup and stand 30

00:34:12.609 --> 00:34:12.619
but if you kind of backup and stand 30
 

00:34:12.619 --> 00:34:14.740
but if you kind of backup and stand 30
feet away they're very clear and it's

00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:14.750
feet away they're very clear and it's
 

00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:16.839
feet away they're very clear and it's
kind of playing I was trying to try to

00:34:16.839 --> 00:34:16.849
kind of playing I was trying to try to
 

00:34:16.849 --> 00:34:19.569
kind of playing I was trying to try to
create a spatialization of of the idea

00:34:19.569 --> 00:34:19.579
create a spatialization of of the idea
 

00:34:19.579 --> 00:34:23.230
create a spatialization of of the idea
of the glass ceiling and tried kind of

00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:23.240
of the glass ceiling and tried kind of
 

00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:27.220
of the glass ceiling and tried kind of
like discussing in the issue of some

00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:27.230
like discussing in the issue of some
 

00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:28.809
like discussing in the issue of some
something like the glass ceiling is

00:34:28.809 --> 00:34:28.819
something like the glass ceiling is
 

00:34:28.819 --> 00:34:31.000
something like the glass ceiling is
really difficult to have a very clear

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:31.010
really difficult to have a very clear
 

00:34:31.010 --> 00:34:33.339
really difficult to have a very clear
conversation about with coworkers or

00:34:33.339 --> 00:34:33.349
conversation about with coworkers or
 

00:34:33.349 --> 00:34:35.409
conversation about with coworkers or
it's very difficult you can cite facts

00:34:35.409 --> 00:34:35.419
it's very difficult you can cite facts
 

00:34:35.419 --> 00:34:36.430
it's very difficult you can cite facts
and things like that but it's a cloudy

00:34:36.430 --> 00:34:36.440
and things like that but it's a cloudy
 

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:38.950
and things like that but it's a cloudy
issue so I was trying to just do a

00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:38.960
issue so I was trying to just do a
 

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:41.260
issue so I was trying to just do a
spatial version of this this is a board

00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:41.270
spatial version of this this is a board
 

00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:44.290
spatial version of this this is a board
game called career moves which it's a

00:34:44.290 --> 00:34:44.300
game called career moves which it's a
 

00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:47.280
game called career moves which it's a
multi-user physical board game where

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:47.290
multi-user physical board game where
 

00:34:47.290 --> 00:34:49.180
multi-user physical board game where
embedded into the board or all these

00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:49.190
embedded into the board or all these
 

00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:52.089
embedded into the board or all these
little doll pieces like little baby

00:34:52.089 --> 00:34:52.099
little doll pieces like little baby
 

00:34:52.099 --> 00:34:54.700
little doll pieces like little baby
laptops and little like cell phones and

computer viruses and how computer

00:37:05.079 --> 00:37:05.089
computer viruses and how computer
 

00:37:05.089 --> 00:37:09.010
computer viruses and how computer
viruses seemed to be invasive and very

was really bad actually in terms of
 

00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:18.220
was really bad actually in terms of
computer virus reception but I was very

00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:18.230
computer virus reception but I was very
 

00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:19.690
computer virus reception but I was very
interested in computer viruses and I was

00:37:19.690 --> 00:37:19.700
interested in computer viruses and I was

just again this experiment of saying

00:43:57.170 --> 00:43:57.180
just again this experiment of saying
 

00:43:57.180 --> 00:43:58.460
just again this experiment of saying
well what what if you completely

00:43:58.460 --> 00:43:58.470
well what what if you completely
 

00:43:58.470 --> 00:43:59.060
well what what if you completely
inverted

the same kind of game and just change to

00:44:01.310 --> 00:44:01.320
the same kind of game and just change to
 

00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:03.110
the same kind of game and just change to
change one or two of the of the real

00:44:03.110 --> 00:44:03.120
change one or two of the of the real
 

00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:06.500
change one or two of the of the real
parameters so now you really don't want

00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:06.510
parameters so now you really don't want
 

00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:07.400
parameters so now you really don't want
to shoot these things because you want

00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:07.410
to shoot these things because you want
 

00:44:07.410 --> 00:44:09.950
to shoot these things because you want

you can I should finish okay okay and
then you can go back to your interface

00:44:19.310 --> 00:44:19.320
then you can go back to your interface
 

00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:20.900
then you can go back to your interface
or you can go on to another game it can

00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:20.910
or you can go on to another game it can
 

00:44:20.910 --> 00:44:23.750

it's just beginning I'm just beginning
to do that and the last piece I think I

00:55:52.769 --> 00:55:52.779
to do that and the last piece I think I
 

00:55:52.779 --> 00:55:55.289
to do that and the last piece I think I
want to just mention is my piece I did

00:55:55.289 --> 00:55:55.299
want to just mention is my piece I did
 

00:55:55.299 --> 00:55:58.620
want to just mention is my piece I did
this fall last fall that showed in

some smaller images I have larger images

00:56:04.529 --> 00:56:04.539
some smaller images I have larger images
 

00:56:04.539 --> 00:56:07.349
some smaller images I have larger images
in here I think yeah here's here's a

00:56:07.349 --> 00:56:07.359
in here I think yeah here's here's a
 

00:56:07.359 --> 00:56:11.039
in here I think yeah here's here's a
larger image these are game engine hacks

00:56:11.039 --> 00:56:11.049
larger image these are game engine hacks
 

00:56:11.049 --> 00:56:13.079
larger image these are game engine hacks
of the Unreal Engine and which I'm

00:56:13.079 --> 00:56:13.089
of the Unreal Engine and which I'm
 

00:56:13.089 --> 00:56:16.730
of the Unreal Engine and which I'm
trying to tell a story from my childhood

00:56:16.730 --> 00:56:16.740
trying to tell a story from my childhood
 

00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:21.839
trying to tell a story from my childhood
so using 3d action game with guns and

00:56:21.839 --> 00:56:21.849
so using 3d action game with guns and
 

00:56:21.849 --> 00:56:23.579
so using 3d action game with guns and
death and taking all the guns and death

00:56:23.579 --> 00:56:23.589
death and taking all the guns and death
 

00:56:23.589 --> 00:56:26.460
death and taking all the guns and death
hopefully out of it and trying to use it

00:56:26.460 --> 00:56:26.470
hopefully out of it and trying to use it
 

00:56:26.470 --> 00:56:29.640
hopefully out of it and trying to use it
as a storytelling medium so it's it's a

00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:29.650
as a storytelling medium so it's it's a
 

00:56:29.650 --> 00:56:31.799
as a storytelling medium so it's it's a
story about the time when I was 10 years

00:56:31.799 --> 00:56:31.809
story about the time when I was 10 years
 

00:56:31.809 --> 00:56:33.630

old my father set the house on fire and

00:56:33.630 --> 00:56:33.640
old my father set the house on fire and
 

00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:37.170
old my father set the house on fire and
it's and it was it was a pretty weird

00:56:37.170 --> 00:56:37.180
it's and it was it was a pretty weird
 

00:56:37.180 --> 00:56:40.740
it's and it was it was a pretty weird
thing so so you kind of wander through

00:56:40.740 --> 00:56:40.750
thing so so you kind of wander through
 

00:56:40.750 --> 00:56:42.900
thing so so you kind of wander through
and after it was finished I showed it

00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:42.910
and after it was finished I showed it
 

00:56:42.910 --> 00:56:45.150
and after it was finished I showed it
and I showed it in Australia and I

00:56:45.150 --> 00:56:45.160
and I showed it in Australia and I
 

00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:47.339
and I showed it in Australia and I
started to feel like an installation to

00:56:47.339 --> 00:56:47.349
started to feel like an installation to
 

00:56:47.349 --> 00:56:51.210
started to feel like an installation to
me almost many people have mentioned

00:56:51.210 --> 00:56:51.220
me almost many people have mentioned
 

00:56:51.220 --> 00:56:53.339
me almost many people have mentioned
that it feels more like an installation

00:56:53.339 --> 00:56:53.349
that it feels more like an installation
 

00:56:53.349 --> 00:56:54.839
that it feels more like an installation
than a game and I said well is it just

00:56:54.839 --> 00:56:54.849
than a game and I said well is it just
 

00:56:54.849 --> 00:56:56.130
than a game and I said well is it just
because of the content or you know I'm

00:56:56.130 --> 00:56:56.140
because of the content or you know I'm
 

00:56:56.140 --> 00:56:57.930
because of the content or you know I'm
an artist or what about it what about

an artist or what about it what about
 

00:56:57.940 --> 00:57:00.630

the texture of this piece is it the

00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:00.640
the texture of this piece is it the
 

00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:03.450
the texture of this piece is it the
sound what and and I don't I don't

00:57:03.450 --> 00:57:03.460
sound what and and I don't I don't
 

00:57:03.460 --> 00:57:05.190
sound what and and I don't I don't
really know so I'm still investigating

00:57:05.190 --> 00:57:05.200
really know so I'm still investigating
 

00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:08.099
really know so I'm still investigating
that what happens in the game is that

00:57:08.099 --> 00:57:08.109
that what happens in the game is that
 

00:57:08.109 --> 00:57:11.990
that what happens in the game is that
you you run around and you you can shoot

00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:12.000
you you run around and you you can shoot

mean to damage your nice screen but yeah

00:57:20.570 --> 00:57:20.580
mean to damage your nice screen but yeah
 

00:57:20.580 --> 00:57:23.240
mean to damage your nice screen but yeah
you can shoot these like beer bottles

00:57:23.240 --> 00:57:23.250
you can shoot these like beer bottles
 

00:57:23.250 --> 00:57:24.620
you can shoot these like beer bottles
and romance novels and things on the

00:57:24.620 --> 00:57:24.630
and romance novels and things on the
 

00:57:24.630 --> 00:57:28.100
and romance novels and things on the
wall and and in kinda and then they fade

00:57:28.100 --> 00:57:28.110
wall and and in kinda and then they fade
 

00:57:28.110 --> 00:57:30.310
wall and and in kinda and then they fade
away and and then this in version two

00:57:30.310 --> 00:57:30.320
away and and then this in version two
 

00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:32.630
away and and then this in version two
you can shoot them at the fire because

00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:32.640
you can shoot them at the fire because
 

00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:34.760
you can shoot them at the fire because
the fire starts to consume the whole 3d

00:57:34.760 --> 00:57:34.770
the fire starts to consume the whole 3d
 

00:57:34.770 --> 00:57:37.250
the fire starts to consume the whole 3d
structure and and that's ultimately when

00:57:37.250 --> 00:57:37.260
structure and and that's ultimately when
 

00:57:37.260 --> 00:57:38.750

you lose a game but you can fight it off

00:57:38.750 --> 00:57:38.760
you lose a game but you can fight it off
 

00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:41.030
you lose a game but you can fight it off
and you can kind of try to contain it

00:57:41.030 --> 00:57:41.040
and you can kind of try to contain it
 

00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:43.880
and you can kind of try to contain it
but it spreads and you can fight fight

00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:43.890
but it spreads and you can fight fight
 

00:57:43.890 --> 00:57:45.230
but it spreads and you can fight fight
it that way but that's that's version

00:57:45.230 --> 00:57:45.240
it that way but that's that's version
 

00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:48.140
it that way but that's that's version
true that's coming in about two months

00:57:48.140 --> 00:57:48.150
true that's coming in about two months
 

00:57:48.150 --> 00:57:51.200
true that's coming in about two months
that all the fire will be finished so

00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:51.210
that all the fire will be finished so
 

00:57:51.210 --> 00:57:54.170
that all the fire will be finished so
these hopefully III think to wrap up

00:57:54.170 --> 00:57:54.180
these hopefully III think to wrap up
 

00:57:54.180 --> 00:57:58.430
these hopefully III think to wrap up
what I want to do is just mention this

00:57:58.430 --> 00:57:58.440
what I want to do is just mention this
 

00:57:58.440 --> 00:58:01.550
what I want to do is just mention this
idea to reiterate my idea of this what

process I mean I I've given you a very

00:58:05.570 --> 00:58:05.580
process I mean I I've given you a very
 

00:58:05.580 --> 00:58:09.860
process I mean I I've given you a very
strange probably slice of kind of

00:58:09.860 --> 00:58:09.870
strange probably slice of kind of

contemporary art practices and digital

00:58:11.900 --> 00:58:11.910
contemporary art practices and digital
 

00:58:11.910 --> 00:58:14.270
contemporary art practices and digital
art practices but I feel like this is

00:58:14.270 --> 00:58:14.280
art practices but I feel like this is
 

00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:15.440
art practices but I feel like this is
going to be a very different kind of

00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:15.450
going to be a very different kind of
 

00:58:15.450 --> 00:58:17.240
going to be a very different kind of
narrative than say Paul Miller would

00:58:17.240 --> 00:58:17.250
narrative than say Paul Miller would
 

00:58:17.250 --> 00:58:19.730

give and I and that's why I think the

00:58:19.730 --> 00:58:19.740
give and I and that's why I think the
 

00:58:19.740 --> 00:58:20.750

lecture series is going to be really

00:58:20.750 --> 00:58:20.760
lecture series is going to be really
 

00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:23.030
lecture series is going to be really
exciting you could look at all kinds of

00:58:23.030 --> 00:58:23.040
exciting you could look at all kinds of
 

00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:24.830
exciting you could look at all kinds of
art and Technology combinations that I

00:58:24.830 --> 00:58:24.840
art and Technology combinations that I
 

00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:26.270
art and Technology combinations that I
have not touched on at all you could

have not touched on at all you could
 

00:58:26.280 --> 00:58:28.820
have not touched on at all you could
look at you know where is stellar and

00:58:28.820 --> 00:58:28.830
look at you know where is stellar and
 

00:58:28.830 --> 00:58:31.160
look at you know where is stellar and
and where are cyborgs and where are

00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:31.170
and where are cyborgs and where are
 

00:58:31.170 --> 00:58:32.990

there are so many different places to

there are so many different places to
 

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:36.080
there are so many different places to
look at art science combinations you

00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:36.090
look at art science combinations you
 

00:58:36.090 --> 00:58:38.150
look at art science combinations you
know robotics and Simon Penny's work all

00:58:38.150 --> 00:58:38.160
know robotics and Simon Penny's work all
 

00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:39.800
know robotics and Simon Penny's work all
there's its if there's a lot of stuff

00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:39.810
there's its if there's a lot of stuff
 

00:58:39.810 --> 00:58:42.290
there's its if there's a lot of stuff
but I'm primarily looking at things that

00:58:42.290 --> 00:58:42.300
but I'm primarily looking at things that
 

00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:44.840
but I'm primarily looking at things that
are that are emergent that have

00:58:44.840 --> 00:58:44.850
are that are emergent that have
 

00:58:44.850 --> 00:58:48.260
are that are emergent that have
unexpected outcomes that are most of the

00:58:48.260 --> 00:58:48.270
unexpected outcomes that are most of the
 

00:58:48.270 --> 00:58:50.300
unexpected outcomes that are most of the
stuff I'm interested in a screen based

00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:50.310
stuff I'm interested in a screen based
 

00:58:50.310 --> 00:58:53.690
stuff I'm interested in a screen based
in some way because I think that is the

00:58:53.690 --> 00:58:53.700
in some way because I think that is the
 

00:58:53.700 --> 00:58:56.390
in some way because I think that is the
material of what we're working with and

00:58:56.390 --> 00:58:56.400
material of what we're working with and
 

00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:57.860
material of what we're working with and
it doesn't mean that I as an artist

00:58:57.860 --> 00:58:57.870
it doesn't mean that I as an artist
 

00:58:57.870 --> 00:58:59.690
it doesn't mean that I as an artist
don't like to make stuff I do like to

00:58:59.690 --> 00:58:59.700
don't like to make stuff I do like to
 

00:58:59.700 --> 00:59:03.620
don't like to make stuff I do like to
make you know things and and spaces but

00:59:03.620 --> 00:59:03.630
make you know things and and spaces but
 

00:59:03.630 --> 00:59:06.110
make you know things and and spaces but
the material is is particularly

00:59:06.110 --> 00:59:06.120
the material is is particularly
 

00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:08.540
the material is is particularly
interesting and then how do you exhibit

00:59:08.540 --> 00:59:08.550
interesting and then how do you exhibit
 

00:59:08.550 --> 00:59:11.000
interesting and then how do you exhibit
this work if it's made for a screen and

of digital culture I mean that's what I
 

01:03:08.029 --> 01:03:09.009
of digital culture I mean that's what I
think I'm doing it

01:03:09.009 --> 01:03:09.019
think I'm doing it
 

01:03:09.019 --> 01:03:11.920

a particular position that I'm looking
at these spaces because even though a

01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:27.470
at these spaces because even though a
 

01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:30.670

this kind of world I think that may be a
 

01:03:32.809 --> 01:03:36.249
this kind of world I think that may be a
space so that's that's kind of how I

01:03:36.249 --> 01:03:36.259
space so that's that's kind of how I
 

01:03:36.259 --> 01:03:37.960
space so that's that's kind of how I
would overall conceptually position my

01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:37.970
would overall conceptually position my
 

01:03:37.970 --> 01:03:41.289
would overall conceptually position my
work as far as the research outcomes or

the research kind of vet investigation I

01:03:44.650 --> 01:03:44.660
the research kind of vet investigation I
 

01:03:44.660 --> 01:03:49.479
the research kind of vet investigation I
think that there's there's just a

think that there's there's just a
 

01:03:49.489 --> 01:03:54.400
think that there's there's just a
different I just think that the maybe

01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:54.410
different I just think that the maybe
 

01:03:54.410 --> 01:03:56.620
different I just think that the maybe
the just the difference between research

01:03:56.620 --> 01:03:56.630
the just the difference between research
 

01:03:56.630 --> 01:03:58.299
the just the difference between research
that something like this and research

01:04:38.269 --> 01:04:40.089
whiz-bang cool computer graphics go to
SIGGRAPH or something like that I really

01:04:40.089 --> 01:04:40.099
SIGGRAPH or something like that I really

many of these works I still I'm
interested for example I think that that

as different kinds of research like you
could look at simultaneous searches and

01:05:16.180 --> 01:05:16.190
could look at simultaneous searches and
 

01:05:16.190 --> 01:05:18.339
could look at simultaneous searches and
various cultures you could look around

01:05:18.339 --> 01:05:18.349
various cultures you could look around
 

01:05:18.349 --> 01:05:20.289
various cultures you could look around
the around the globe and say okay well

how do these how do the searches compare

how do these how do the searches compare
in different places you could also start

01:05:24.069 --> 01:05:24.079
in different places you could also start
 

01:05:24.079 --> 01:05:26.759
in different places you could also start
looking at images and the kinds of of

01:05:26.759 --> 01:05:26.769

probably be it might have a lot of
 

01:06:34.999 --> 01:06:36.819
probably be it might have a lot of
issues and you might have lost a lot of

issues and you might have lost a lot of
 

01:06:36.829 --> 01:06:38.499

examining because things change so
 

01:06:40.130 --> 01:06:42.640
examining because things change so
quickly so it so these I think these

it's it's a valuable critique and
 

01:08:17.540 --> 01:08:19.780
it's it's a valuable critique and
especially in the UK and in Australia

installation I've seen this kind of

01:08:31.590 --> 01:08:31.600
installation I've seen this kind of
 

01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:34.690
installation I've seen this kind of
trying to do data and and even people I

01:08:34.690 --> 01:08:34.700
trying to do data and and even people I

had this meeting at Banff with this guy

01:08:36.700 --> 01:08:36.710
had this meeting at Banff with this guy
 

01:08:36.710 --> 01:08:39.040
had this meeting at Banff with this guy
from NASA and he and he was saying well

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:39.050
from NASA and he and he was saying well
 

01:08:39.050 --> 01:08:42.160
from NASA and he and he was saying well
if you had data to back up your art we

01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:42.170
if you had data to back up your art we
 

01:08:42.170 --> 01:08:50.260
if you had data to back up your art we
could find you and that's really a

01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:50.270
could find you and that's really a
 

01:08:50.270 --> 01:08:52.300
could find you and that's really a
difficult question it he was really

01:08:52.300 --> 01:08:52.310
difficult question it he was really
 

01:08:52.310 --> 01:08:54.490
difficult question it he was really
serious he wanted if I had this project

01:08:54.490 --> 01:08:54.500
serious he wanted if I had this project
 

01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:55.450
serious he wanted if I had this project
that was talking about he's like oh I

01:08:55.450 --> 01:08:55.460
that was talking about he's like oh I
 

01:08:55.460 --> 01:08:57.070

NASA will let me fund that unless you

01:08:58.780 --> 01:08:58.790
NASA will let me fund that unless you
 

01:08:58.790 --> 01:09:04.390

he said well you could figure out a way

01:09:06.870 --> 01:09:06.880
he said well you could figure out a way

so that conversation happens all the

and and I haven't I haven't gone to that
place of trying to justify that work but

what is tempting in a way because it's
 

01:09:20.650 --> 01:09:22.769

common language between artists and sign
 

01:09:25.299 --> 01:09:26.700

and I don't think that's the right

01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:26.710
and I don't think that's the right
 

01:09:26.710 --> 01:09:29.219
and I don't think that's the right
language but it's if it's sometimes it

01:09:29.219 --> 01:09:29.229
language but it's if it's sometimes it
 

01:09:29.229 --> 01:09:30.509
language but it's if it's sometimes it
feels very close and sometimes it feels

01:09:30.509 --> 01:09:30.519
feels very close and sometimes it feels
 

01:09:30.519 --> 01:09:32.099
feels very close and sometimes it feels
not very close at all in between I mean

01:09:32.099 --> 01:09:32.109
not very close at all in between I mean
 

01:09:32.109 --> 01:09:34.140
not very close at all in between I mean

is not funding a whole lot of artists so

01:09:36.839 --> 01:09:36.849
is not funding a whole lot of artists so
 

01:09:36.849 --> 01:10:08.989
is not funding a whole lot of artists so
there are these huge gaps culturally and

01:10:08.989 --> 01:10:08.999
 

01:10:08.999 --> 01:10:11.640
III think it is a challenge but I think

I want to be fair to scientists and say

01:10:14.969 --> 01:10:14.979
I want to be fair to scientists and say
 

01:10:14.979 --> 01:10:17.669
I want to be fair to scientists and say
that probably most of the time they they

01:10:17.669 --> 01:10:17.679
that probably most of the time they they
 

01:10:17.679 --> 01:10:19.560
that probably most of the time they they
just don't I mean they're just not going

01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:19.570
just don't I mean they're just not going
 

01:10:19.570 --> 01:10:21.060
just don't I mean they're just not going
to the same places and there are a lot

01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:21.070
to the same places and there are a lot
 

01:10:21.070 --> 01:10:23.399
to the same places and there are a lot
of science I'm eeen so many scientists

01:10:23.399 --> 01:10:23.409
of science I'm eeen so many scientists
 

01:10:23.409 --> 01:10:26.759
of science I'm eeen so many scientists
are musicians and artists and so I think

01:10:26.759 --> 01:10:26.769
are musicians and artists and so I think
 

01:10:26.769 --> 01:10:30.120
are musicians and artists and so I think
it's it's definitely complicated but and

01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:30.130
it's it's definitely complicated but and
 

01:10:30.130 --> 01:10:32.910
it's it's definitely complicated but and
and and it's still not easy to get that

01:10:32.910 --> 01:10:32.920
and and it's still not easy to get that
 

01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:36.270

I've never gotten funded from NSF for my
 

01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:44.790
I've never gotten funded from NSF for my

artwork so I would love to that's the
 

01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:47.399
artwork so I would love to that's the
next scheme but anyway it's it's it's a

01:10:47.399 --> 01:10:47.409
next scheme but anyway it's it's it's a
 

01:10:47.409 --> 01:11:05.390
next scheme but anyway it's it's it's a
large question for us all

experiential viewpoint and once from a
 

01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:17.630
experiential viewpoint and once from a
very rigorous scientific viewpoint and

very rigorous scientific viewpoint and

their different methodologies but

01:11:18.860 --> 01:11:18.870
their different methodologies but
 

01:11:18.870 --> 01:11:21.350
their different methodologies but
they're exploring similar issues like

01:11:21.350 --> 01:11:21.360
they're exploring similar issues like
 

01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:28.880
they're exploring similar issues like

stuff answers different questions being
 

01:11:32.969 --> 01:11:35.060
stuff answers different questions being
overblown it answers the questions of

01:11:35.060 --> 01:11:35.070
overblown it answers the questions of
 

01:11:35.070 --> 01:11:37.370
overblown it answers the questions of
the soul or even the condition and you

01:11:37.370 --> 01:11:37.380
the soul or even the condition and you
 

01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:39.979
the soul or even the condition and you
can't really do that much as Douglas

01:11:39.979 --> 01:11:39.989
can't really do that much as Douglas
 

01:11:39.989 --> 01:11:41.600
can't really do that much as Douglas
Davis remember there what

01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:41.610
Davis remember there what
 

01:11:41.610 --> 01:11:51.740
Davis remember there what
everything.this tries to with yeah and

there are a lot of like feminist

01:11:52.970 --> 01:11:52.980
there are a lot of like feminist
 

01:11:52.980 --> 01:11:54.050
there are a lot of like feminist
critiques of science which call for

01:11:54.050 --> 01:11:54.060
critiques of science which call for
 

01:11:54.060 --> 01:11:56.419
critiques of science which call for
bringing that all that work back in to

01:11:56.419 --> 01:11:56.429
bringing that all that work back in to
 

01:11:56.429 --> 01:11:58.660
bringing that all that work back in to
talk about experiential and talk about

01:11:58.660 --> 01:11:58.670
talk about experiential and talk about
 

01:11:58.670 --> 01:12:01.399
talk about experiential and talk about
subjective science like saying you know

01:12:01.399 --> 01:12:01.409
subjective science like saying you know
 

01:12:01.409 --> 01:12:03.350
subjective science like saying you know
if we brought subjectivity and made it

01:12:03.350 --> 01:12:03.360
if we brought subjectivity and made it
 

01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:04.729
if we brought subjectivity and made it
okay again maybe we would be getting

01:12:04.729 --> 01:12:04.739
okay again maybe we would be getting
 

01:12:04.739 --> 01:12:08.209
okay again maybe we would be getting
different kinds of scientific processes

01:12:08.209 --> 01:12:08.219
different kinds of scientific processes
 

01:12:08.219 --> 01:12:34.719
different kinds of scientific processes
it's an interesting stuff yeah yeah

01:12:34.719 --> 01:12:34.729
 

01:12:34.729 --> 01:12:48.430

the new thing
I don't did I do the new thing okay I is

I don't did I do the new thing okay I is
 

01:12:57.739 --> 01:13:03.779
I don't did I do the new thing okay I is
not I wouldn't say I'm sure like I mean

01:13:03.779 --> 01:13:03.789
not I wouldn't say I'm sure like I mean
 

01:13:03.789 --> 01:13:06.580
not I wouldn't say I'm sure like I mean
frankly I can't answer that question I I

01:13:06.580 --> 01:13:06.590
frankly I can't answer that question I I
 

01:13:06.590 --> 01:13:09.279
frankly I can't answer that question I I
can't answer what is good art I'm not I

01:13:09.279 --> 01:13:09.289
can't answer what is good art I'm not I
 

01:13:09.289 --> 01:13:13.149
can't answer what is good art I'm not I
I don't care I mean I I mean I know what

01:13:13.149 --> 01:13:13.159
I don't care I mean I I mean I know what
 

01:13:13.159 --> 01:13:16.810
I don't care I mean I I mean I know what
I find moving and important work and I'm

I find moving and important work and I'm
 

01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:18.879
I find moving and important work and I'm

01:13:26.290 --> 01:13:26.300
how could you say that about Fluxus it's
 

01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:28.660
how could you say that about Fluxus it's
or conceptual art how do you know what's

01:13:28.660 --> 01:13:28.670
or conceptual art how do you know what's
 

01:13:28.670 --> 01:13:31.870
or conceptual art how do you know what's
it what's a good work or not and that's

I feel like I've kind of communicated
 

01:13:40.099 --> 01:13:42.069
I feel like I've kind of communicated
something or built a system that's

01:13:42.069 --> 01:13:42.079
something or built a system that's
 

01:13:42.079 --> 01:13:44.199
something or built a system that's
that's created something and I and I

that's created something and I and I
 

01:13:44.209 --> 01:13:45.850
that's created something and I and I
definitely feel like there are aesthetic

01:13:45.850 --> 01:13:45.860
definitely feel like there are aesthetic
 

01:13:45.860 --> 01:13:49.319
definitely feel like there are aesthetic
parameters that I personally follow but

01:13:49.319 --> 01:13:49.329
parameters that I personally follow but
 

01:13:49.329 --> 01:13:51.609

you know someone who's investigating

01:13:51.609 --> 01:13:51.619

this right now is Don Ritter he said

this right now is Don Ritter he said
he's a video artist lives in Brooklyn

01:13:58.299 --> 01:13:58.309
he's a video artist lives in Brooklyn
 

01:13:58.309 --> 01:14:01.359
he's a video artist lives in Brooklyn
and he he's writing a book about the

01:14:01.359 --> 01:14:01.369
and he he's writing a book about the
 

01:14:01.369 --> 01:14:03.310
and he he's writing a book about the
aesthetics of new media or something

01:14:03.310 --> 01:14:03.320
aesthetics of new media or something
 

01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:04.600
aesthetics of new media or something
something along these lines and I think

01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:04.610
something along these lines and I think
 

01:14:04.610 --> 01:14:06.959
something along these lines and I think
there's one other book like this in

you can get pieces of the story and

01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:12.850
you can get pieces of the story and
 

01:16:12.850 --> 01:16:14.700
you can get pieces of the story and
eventually by exploring the space you

would get most of the story if someone

01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:16.330
would get most of the story if someone
 

01:16:16.330 --> 01:16:17.640
would get most of the story if someone
doesn't get the whole story I think it's

01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:17.650
doesn't get the whole story I think it's
 

01:16:17.650 --> 01:16:19.770
doesn't get the whole story I think it's
okay but somebody needs to get something

01:16:19.770 --> 01:16:19.780
okay but somebody needs to get something
 

01:16:19.780 --> 01:16:22.050
okay but somebody needs to get something
out of it so that's the kind of mind

01:16:22.050 --> 01:16:22.060
out of it so that's the kind of mind
 

01:16:22.060 --> 01:16:25.830
out of it so that's the kind of mind
that I would draw draw for it like but

01:16:25.830 --> 01:16:25.840
that I would draw draw for it like but
 

01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:27.240
that I would draw draw for it like but
it's it's very interesting because I

01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:27.250
it's it's very interesting because I
 

01:16:27.250 --> 01:16:29.130
it's it's very interesting because I
have those there's some pieces in there

01:16:29.130 --> 01:16:29.140
have those there's some pieces in there
 

01:16:29.140 --> 01:16:31.380

where there's just huge walls of text
that kind of spray out and they're kind

01:16:34.620 --> 01:16:34.630
that kind of spray out and they're kind
 

01:16:34.630 --> 01:16:36.450
that kind of spray out and they're kind
of hard to read and people just run

01:16:36.450 --> 01:16:36.460
of hard to read and people just run

right by them the work the work showed

01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:39.310
right by them the work the work showed
 

01:16:39.310 --> 01:16:41.160
right by them the work the work showed
in Australia the first time I showed was

01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:41.170
in Australia the first time I showed was
 

01:16:41.170 --> 01:16:43.350
in Australia the first time I showed was
in this gaming show so all the works

01:16:43.350 --> 01:16:43.360
in this gaming show so all the works
 

01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:45.110
in this gaming show so all the works
were games and that had a very

01:16:45.110 --> 01:16:45.120
were games and that had a very
 

01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:48.060
were games and that had a very
particular meaning as far as how someone

01:16:48.060 --> 01:16:48.070
particular meaning as far as how someone
 

01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:50.790
particular meaning as far as how someone
would approach that work so people sit

01:16:50.790 --> 01:16:50.800
would approach that work so people sit
 

01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:52.530
would approach that work so people sit
down in the in every single one of them

01:16:52.530 --> 01:16:52.540
down in the in every single one of them
 

01:16:52.540 --> 01:16:53.610
down in the in every single one of them
and they treated it like an arcade

01:16:53.610 --> 01:16:53.620
and they treated it like an arcade
 

01:16:53.620 --> 01:16:55.020
and they treated it like an arcade
that's very different

01:16:55.020 --> 01:16:55.030
that's very different
 

01:16:55.030 --> 01:16:56.729
that's very different
and a storytelling medium so I think it

01:16:56.729 --> 01:16:56.739
and a storytelling medium so I think it
 

01:16:56.739 --> 01:16:58.529
and a storytelling medium so I think it
also depends in the context of reception

01:16:58.529 --> 01:16:58.539
also depends in the context of reception
 

01:16:58.539 --> 01:17:01.770
also depends in the context of reception
- I had to slow I had to actually go in

01:17:01.770 --> 01:17:01.780
- I had to slow I had to actually go in
 

01:17:01.780 --> 01:17:04.260
- I had to slow I had to actually go in
and slow the character's feet the the

01:17:04.260 --> 01:17:04.270
and slow the character's feet the the

run cycle down because people were

01:17:06.750 --> 01:17:06.760
run cycle down because people were
 

01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:08.850
run cycle down because people were
running so faster than work that I think

01:17:08.850 --> 01:17:08.860
running so faster than work that I think
 

01:17:08.860 --> 01:17:11.160
running so faster than work that I think
they weren't getting it but he doesn't

they weren't getting it but he doesn't
 

01:17:11.170 --> 01:17:13.229
they weren't getting it but he doesn't
get it at all so but why I just you know

01:17:13.229 --> 01:17:13.239
get it at all so but why I just you know
 

01:17:13.239 --> 01:17:16.979
get it at all so but why I just you know
when they're in mud they got it and they

01:17:16.979 --> 01:17:16.989
when they're in mud they got it and they
 

01:17:16.989 --> 01:17:19.109
when they're in mud they got it and they
weren't they and they didn't get they

01:17:19.109 --> 01:17:19.119
weren't they and they didn't get they

were more frustrated being able to run

01:17:20.729 --> 01:17:20.739
were more frustrated being able to run
 

01:17:20.739 --> 01:17:22.950
were more frustrated being able to run
fast and just run by everything I

01:17:22.950 --> 01:17:22.960
fast and just run by everything I
 

01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:24.660
fast and just run by everything I
thought they'd be really frustrated if I

01:17:24.660 --> 01:17:24.670
thought they'd be really frustrated if I
 

01:17:24.670 --> 01:17:26.100
thought they'd be really frustrated if I
slowed them down because I would be like

01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:26.110
slowed them down because I would be like
 

01:17:26.110 --> 01:17:28.470
slowed them down because I would be like
come on but um they weren't actually
