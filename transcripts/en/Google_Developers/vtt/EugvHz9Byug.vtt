00:00:03.829 --> 00:00:05.620
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Hello,
I'm Magnus Hyttsten

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:06.661
for "The Developer Show."

00:00:06.661 --> 00:00:08.620
We're here at the
TensorFlow Dev Summit

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.560
with Andy Selle, who just did
a presentation on TensorFlow

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:12.060
Lite.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.132
So Andy, what is
TensorFlow Lite?

00:00:14.132 --> 00:00:16.090
ANDREW SELLE: So TensorFlow
Lite is our product

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.470
for doing fast and small mobile
inference on small devices that

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.900
are resource-constrained,
like mobile phones.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.670
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: So
it's not for training,

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.317
it's more for
inference on a model.

00:00:26.317 --> 00:00:28.150
ANDREW SELLE: Right
now, it's for inference.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.440
But in the future, we're
going to explore training.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.731
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: OK, excellent.

00:00:31.731 --> 00:00:33.310
So what kind of
applications can we

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.710
imagine out there being
built on TensorFlow Lite?

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.360
ANDREW SELLE: So there are
several Google Apps out there

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.151
today that employ
machine intelligence that

00:00:39.151 --> 00:00:41.770
are switching over to TF Lite,
or already have switched over.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.130
So some examples are Google
Photos, the Assistant,

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:46.840
and Smart Reply.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.780
And you can see more about that
if you look at our talk log.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.880
But one of the great
things is that once you

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.640
make it easy for any developer,
not just like a machine

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.190
learning expert, to
run fast inference,

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.290
app developers are
going to transition

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.300
to being able to put
this into every app

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.176
and use it for applications
we can't imagine.

00:01:03.176 --> 00:01:04.800
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: How
does this actually

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.820
work on a mobile device
that's small and has

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.090
battery constraints and
all of these things?

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.840
ANDREW SELLE: Yeah,
so TensorFlow Lite, it

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.460
was architected
from the ground up

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:13.961
to work on really small devices.

00:01:13.961 --> 00:01:15.460
So that basically
means that we want

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:16.780
to keep the binary size small.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.220
So when somebody
downloads an app,

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.178
they don't have to wait
a long time to do that.

00:01:20.178 --> 00:01:22.177
And also we want to
make sure it's fast,

00:01:22.177 --> 00:01:24.760
so when they do something they
don't have to wait a long time,

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.011
or that app developers can
use it where they otherwise

00:01:27.011 --> 00:01:29.260
wouldn't be able to because
it wouldn't be a good user

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.930
experience.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.260
So once we're fast enough
and once we're small enough,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.790
every developer can
put it into every app.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.820
And it will allow
lots of things.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.440
And we frankly
can't imagine what

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.640
apps app developers will do.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.640
One of the great things
is that they're creative

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.390
and they can use it
in all sorts of ways.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.610
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Super cool.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.250
And we mostly talked
about mobile apps here,

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.890
but in fact, TensorFlow
Lite goes way beyond that.

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.040
We had an important
announcement today.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.790
ANDREW SELLE: Yeah,
so for the first time,

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:55.780
we showed Raspberry Pi.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.080
And that's a single--

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.050
it's a cheap
single-board computer

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.610
that uses a cell phone chip.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.200
But it basically
has allowed schools

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.680
and allows individuals
to afford many computers

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.998
to do robotic applications.

00:02:06.998 --> 00:02:09.039
It can interface with lots
of different hardware.

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.449
You can plug motors into it.

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:13.480
So this is going to be a really
good gateway for hobbyists

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.700
to get into machine
learning and running it

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.340
for all kinds of
interesting applications

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.640
that are multimodal with device
outputs and multiple sensors,

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.200
again, because they
can put sensors

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.840
that the cell phone
manufacturer--

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:25.840
you get your cell phone.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.087
It has one device or
you can't change it.

00:02:29.087 --> 00:02:30.920
But this, you can plug
in whatever you want.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.560
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: And it's kind
of a bridge to the Internet

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.640
of Things as well, right?

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.806
ANDREW SELLE: Yeah, exactly.

00:02:34.806 --> 00:02:36.370
In fact, so it's
Raspberry Pi, but it

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.730
could be any Linux-based
system-on-chip computer

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.450
will work fine with a minor
tweak to, say, the Makefiles.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.580
But TensorFlow Lite
is so easy to port

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.330
that it's not really
that hard to do that.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:48.310
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Super cool.

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.870
So the question
on everyone's mind

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.300
is how can I actually get
started with TensorFlow Lite

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.470
if I'm a developer?

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:54.400
ANDREW SELLE: So
this is really easy

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.570
because it's all on GitHub.

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.360
And the documentation is
all on tensorflow.org.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.360
So we released this last fall,
so it's been there for a while.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.610
So you can play with it now.

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.380
And we're excited to
hear all your feedback.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.350
We're excited to see
what you use it for.

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.850
We have a mailing
list as well now,

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.490
which is tflite@tensorflow.org,
in addition

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.094
to the GitHub and the website.

00:03:14.094 --> 00:03:15.260
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Super cool.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.420
I'm Magnus Hyttsten.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.030
This is Andy Selle for
"The Developer Show."

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.530
We're at the
TensorFlow Dev Summit

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.590
talking about TensorFlow Lite.

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.040
