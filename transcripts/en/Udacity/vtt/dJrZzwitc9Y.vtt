00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:03.410
Now that we have an idea of what our graph will mean, I've gone ahead and drawn

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:07.135
it for you. Know that the graph looks like it's made up of pieces of four

00:00:07.135 --> 00:00:11.484
different lines with different slopes. And in fact, it's exactly what's

00:00:11.484 --> 00:00:15.010
happening. So, we can see how they all compare to one another. I'd like you

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.185
tell me what the equation in for each part of the line is. Remember that the

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:22.967
slope of each line will be the tax rate of the bracket that corresponds to it

00:00:22.967 --> 00:00:27.926
written in decimal form. If you figured this out for each line segment, and

00:00:27.926 --> 00:00:31.454
then simply find a point on each of these sections of the line, you can use the

00:00:31.454 --> 00:00:36.986
point-slope formula to find the equation of the line. Please use x for the

00:00:36.986 --> 00:00:40.890
income, which is on the horizontal axis and t for taxes owed, since it's on the

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.109
vertical axis.
