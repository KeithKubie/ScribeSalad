00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:03.670
Beyoncé of House Knowles,
first of her name,

00:00:03.704 --> 00:00:05.672
queen of everything,
child of Destiny,

00:00:05.706 --> 00:00:07.741
-mother of single ladies...
-(laughter)

00:00:07.774 --> 00:00:09.743
dropped her new album, <i>Lemonade,</i>

00:00:09.776 --> 00:00:11.645
which is apparently
right around the corner

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:14.781
-from where fudge is made. Um...
-(laughter)

00:00:14.815 --> 00:00:15.983
(applause and cheering)

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:17.751
-Along with... an HBO special...
-MAN: Yes!

00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:21.255
Along with an HBO special
that made her fans do this.

00:00:21.288 --> 00:00:23.457
They were very excited.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.228
-(laughter)
-Uh, now the... the... the...

00:00:28.262 --> 00:00:30.564
The biggest revelation
from the album

00:00:30.597 --> 00:00:32.266
is that Jay Z
might have cheated.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:34.801
Now, he warned her in advance
that he was big pimpin',

00:00:34.835 --> 00:00:36.003
and monogamy goes with pimpin'

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:38.238
like sardines
with peanut butter, but come on.

00:00:38.272 --> 00:00:40.307
It's Beyoncé!

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.142
(applause and cheering)

00:00:42.176 --> 00:00:43.844
There is speculation.

00:00:43.877 --> 00:00:45.979
Fans think the affair was
with fashion designer

00:00:46.013 --> 00:00:47.681
and person
not-that-many-people-know

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:50.851
Rachel Roy, which led to some
confused people on the Internet

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:53.220
to start attacking
celebrity chef Rachael Ray...

00:00:53.253 --> 00:00:56.823
(laughter and applause)

00:00:56.857 --> 00:01:00.027
...uh... seen here

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.429
being that cooking lady on TV
that your mom likes.

00:01:02.462 --> 00:01:04.431
Now, angry fans left lemon emoji

00:01:04.464 --> 00:01:08.035
all over Ray-Ray's Instagram,
like this.

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:11.505
(laughter)

00:01:11.538 --> 00:01:13.640
Others, however,
came to Rachael Ray's defense.

00:01:13.674 --> 00:01:14.942
Y'all dumb as hell,

00:01:14.975 --> 00:01:16.944
she's just trying
to make burgers.

00:01:16.977 --> 00:01:18.912
(laughter, applause)

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.518
So, comedians...

00:01:24.551 --> 00:01:27.855
how can Rachael Ray fire back
against this injustice?

00:01:27.888 --> 00:01:29.489
Alanna Masterson.

00:01:29.523 --> 00:01:31.658
She should
actually (bleep) Jay Z.

00:01:31.692 --> 00:01:32.960
(laughter)

00:01:32.993 --> 00:01:34.728
HARDWICK:
That would be amazing.

00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:36.663
-(applause)
-That would be amazing.

00:01:36.697 --> 00:01:38.232
Points. Danny Masterson.

00:01:38.265 --> 00:01:41.835
She should send over some of
her famous blueberry, oatmeal,

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:43.670
flaxseed and rat poison muffins.

00:01:43.704 --> 00:01:46.139
-Yeah. Points. Very good.
-(laughter, applause)

00:01:46.173 --> 00:01:46.240
-That's what she's known for.
-Those are top sellers.
