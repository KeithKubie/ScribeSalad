00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:56.860 align:start position:0%
this performance and a lot of people
 

00:11:56.860 --> 00:12:00.090 align:start position:0%
this performance and a lot of people

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:00.100 align:start position:0%
would say well just because he got here
 

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
would say well just because he got here
doesn't<00:12:00.400><c> mean</c><00:12:00.520><c> he's</c><00:12:00.700><c> that</c><00:12:00.850><c> great</c><00:12:00.970><c> cuz</c><00:12:01.180><c> it's</c>

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:01.330 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean he's that great cuz it's
 

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:03.329 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean he's that great cuz it's
just<00:12:01.510><c> voice</c><00:12:01.630><c> acting</c><00:12:02.200><c> I</c><00:12:02.380><c> really</c><00:12:02.770><c> disagree</c><00:12:03.070><c> I</c>

00:12:03.329 --> 00:12:03.339 align:start position:0%
just voice acting I really disagree I
 

00:12:03.339 --> 00:12:05.850 align:start position:0%
just voice acting I really disagree I

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:05.860 align:start position:0%
think with voice acting it's even
 

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:07.860 align:start position:0%
think with voice acting it's even
tougher<00:12:06.040><c> because</c><00:12:06.940><c> you</c><00:12:07.089><c> have</c><00:12:07.270><c> to</c><00:12:07.420><c> get</c><00:12:07.540><c> it</c><00:12:07.660><c> all</c>

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:07.870 align:start position:0%
tougher because you have to get it all
