00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.800
In the battle of the sexes we are 
fiercely divided, who has a worse when it

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:04.870
comes to pain?

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.280
On the one hand women are left with the
task of fitting a watermelon sized

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.680
object through a coin sized hole.  On the
other hand, males protest that even the

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.539
slightest nick of their family jewels
can leave them incapacitated.

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:20.300
So which hurts more, childbirth or getting kicked in the balls?

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.470
Before we begin there is a rumor that is
circulating the internet claiming that

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.779
the human body can take up to 45
del units of pain and yet a mother feels

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.460
up to 57 del of pain during
childbirth,

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.020
which is apparently equivalent to 20
bones being fractured at once.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.060
The claim then goes on to suggest that
being kicked in the balls brings more

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.220
than 9000 del of pain.  Now
apart from the absurd logic that both of

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.280
these events can surpass the alleged
human limit it, actually uses a unit of

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.370
pain, the del, which doesn't even exist.
There is a unit of pain once devised

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.120
called the dol, from the latin word for
pain "dolor" but we will discuss this later.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.150
To really evaluate this question we
first need to understand what pain is,

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:00.780
which isn't an easy task.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.100
There is actually a group of specialized
nerve cells in your body called nociceptors

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.990
that react to pain.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.060
Unlike other nerves which readily fire in
response to normal touch or temperature,

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.720
nociceptors will only fire once a certain
pain threshold has been passed.  Some of

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.550
these nociceptors respond quickly sending
signals to the spinal cord and brain

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.989
which produce sharp and sudden pain, allowing you to react quickly

00:01:21.989 --> 00:01:26.179
while others transmit more slowly and are
responsible for the prolonged dull

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:30.439
ache you feel.  For males, testicles are
internal organs that have migrated out

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:34.420
of the body cavity which we explain in
a previous video you can check out here.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.299
And well some internal organs such as
the liver feel no pain, others like the

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:43.000
testicles are covered with many 
nociceptors making them extremely sensitive.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.050
Afterall their well-being is of the utmost importance.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.780
Furthermore the testicles are attached
to many nerves in the stomach as well as

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.770
the vagus is nerve which is directly
connected to the brains vomit center,

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.240
and this is why when hit the pain spreads
throughout the abdomen.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.490
The fact that testicles have minimal
protection only strengthens the

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.270
accompanying symptoms of nausea, increased
blood pressure, heart rate and sweating.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.050
But not so fast gentlemen, even though
childbirth may not be facing a direct

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.680
blow to any internal organs, the
mechanical distension of the uterine

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.640
area also triggers nociceptors and
causes the same kind of visceral pain.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.829
Also consider that throughout evolution
female human hips have become smaller

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:25.310
while babies heads have become
larger.  And not to mention labor lasts

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.990
8 hours on average with a mixture of
nausea, fatigue and pain.

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.840
On top of it all, tension and stretching
of muscle and tissue increase as labour

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.139
intensifies creating sharp and localized
pain.

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:39.889
Okay, so both obviously hurt and have a
lot of mechanical stimulation sending

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:41.980
signals to the pain centers of the brain.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.129
But this is where it gets tricky, because
the pain isn't simply a physical

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:49.590
response but rather a partially
perceptive or subjective experience.

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.220
This means that every single individual
perceives pain in a slightly different

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.849
way.  And not only between individuals but
depending on your mood, alertness or even

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:01.069
previous experience pain may affect
you differently.

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:04.459
It's for this reason that so many
attempts to objectively measure pain have

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.650
failed including the dol system which
we mentioned earlier.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.220
Interestingly nearly 80% of
upper limb amputees experience a

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.949
phenomenon known as "phantom limb pain".

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:18.099
That is they feel pain in a limb that is
no longer there.  And while little is

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:21.579
understood about the mechanism for the
pain, it is clear that there is no

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:26.119
particular input to trigger the response
and yet they still feel a very real

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:26.970
pain.

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.690
As such pain is not a stimulus it is an
experience that is different for

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.940
everybody.  Suffice to say both instances
of childbirth and getting hit in the

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.860
balls can hurt alot.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.570
So we call this one at tie, apart from
the fact that the experiences are

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.879
completely different and there is so many
variables to consider.

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:47.099
In some instances a man could
experience more pain than his female

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:51.540
counterpart and vice versa.  The main
difference being one results in a newborn

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.859
baby, while the other potentially
results in a decreased the chance of

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:56.469
having one.

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:59.849
