00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.738
So that's it for clustering, that's what I wanted to tell you about. Did

00:00:02.738 --> 00:00:06.100
you want to help me remember what we learned? What, what did we talk about?

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.400
&gt;&gt; So, we talked about clustering, as an idea, which is sort

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.584
of a pretty powerful one. And I guess we, we connected that

00:00:12.584 --> 00:00:15.827
to the notion of compact description. And we talked about a bunch

00:00:15.827 --> 00:00:17.501
of algorithms, and in particular we

00:00:17.501 --> 00:00:20.470
talked about k-means and single-linkage clustering.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:21.800
&gt;&gt; That's right, and there was another one.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.250
&gt;&gt; EM.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:23.290
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.292
&gt;&gt; And the big difference between

00:00:25.292 --> 00:00:30.565
EM and the other two is that EM makes for soft clusters versus hard clusters.

00:00:30.565 --> 00:00:33.466
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's one distinction. You could also say that the difference

00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:35.762
between single-link clustering and the others

00:00:35.762 --> 00:00:38.020
is it actually terminates in polynomial time.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.785
&gt;&gt; Mm. Doesn't k-means terminate kind of fast?

00:00:40.785 --> 00:00:42.940
&gt;&gt; I, I don't think we know, exactly. I think it

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.406
could run through a lot of different configurations before it stops.

00:00:46.406 --> 00:00:50.765
&gt;&gt; So we talked about some algorithms. And then we did something rather

00:00:50.765 --> 00:00:56.392
startling, and we showed that clustering is in some sense impossible.

00:00:56.392 --> 00:00:59.692
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, which is silly because we know that it's possible, we do

00:00:59.692 --> 00:01:01.813
it all the time. But we can't

00:01:01.813 --> 00:01:03.764
have those particular three properties all at once.

00:01:03.764 --> 00:01:04.822
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:04.822 --> 00:01:08.634
&gt;&gt; That axiomatization is mutually contradictory.

00:01:08.634 --> 00:01:09.767
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm

00:01:09.767 --> 00:01:11.138
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think, I think that's about it.

00:01:11.138 --> 00:01:14.700
So I'm ready to move onto some other unsupervised topics.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.700
&gt;&gt;

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.640
Huh. Cool. Me too. All right, well thanks, Michael. I learned a lot.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.490
&gt;&gt; Sure, yeah. I think next time

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.750
you're going to tell me about something, features.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.642
&gt;&gt; I'm a tell you about something. Features.

00:01:24.642 --> 00:01:27.070
&gt;&gt; All right! Well, I'm looking forward to something, features.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.962
&gt;&gt; Okay! Bye, Michael.

00:01:28.962 --> 00:01:29.819
&gt;&gt; See you.
