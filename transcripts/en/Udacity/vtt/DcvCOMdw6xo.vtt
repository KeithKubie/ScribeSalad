00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.840
Well, here we are in my example of a

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:08.160
confusing signifier. It's this door plate thing. Well, actually, I'm

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.380
not sure what to call it because this is a

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.910
door handle and this, I thought, was something I could

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.070
push on to open the door, and I can't open

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.990
it. No matter how hard I push it, I can't,

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.210
well, it turns out, it's not a door. This is

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.620
a wall. A glass wall. And they put this plate

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.400
here and I thought I could push on

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.940
it and I can't, so that's a confusing signifier.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:36.440
Now let's look at that for a second. Why is it so? Well, it seems that there's

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.770
a lock mechanism here and the lock mechanism,

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.900
see inside, is about this big. Well, I think

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.180
the designer wanted to have some symmetry so they

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.660
made these two plates the same size, but in

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.280
so doing so, they have kind of an aesthetic

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.210
form there, but they've created a function or a

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.580
false signifier that is confusing. So, how might we

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.390
make this better? Well, let's see. Let's assume we

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.660
want to hide the lock. Maybe we just want

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.950
to make this smaller and keep the symmetry here.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.260
So we might make a plate this big. That

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.730
would be really too small to put my whole hand

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.610
on it. I don't think I would confuse that for a plate. Or, if

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.190
I just wanted to hide the lock, maybe I could make something really small, like

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.040
that. Either way, it would be a little bit better, because I feel like if

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.900
I push this too hard, I might actually do some damage to this glass wall.
