00:00:00.767 --> 00:00:03.504
LIFE AS A THIEF,

00:00:03.537 --> 00:00:05.405
I REALIZED I WOULD
HAVE TO PUT MYSELF

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:09.510
AT GREATER AND GREATER RISK
OF LEGAL CONSEQUENCES.

00:00:09.543 --> 00:00:12.045
MY CRIMES COULD
NO LONGER BE EASY

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:15.682
OR SIMPLY VICTIMIZE
THE OLD AND THE SLOW.

00:00:15.716 --> 00:00:17.251
- EXCUSE ME.
- OH.

00:00:17.284 --> 00:00:19.186
- DID YOU JUST TAKE MY HAT?

00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:20.487
- NO.

00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:21.722
HEY, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:00:21.755 --> 00:00:24.558
IF SOMEBODY DID
TAKE YOUR HAT,

00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:26.593
I WOULD LIKE YOU
TO HAVE MINE.

00:00:26.627 --> 00:00:28.028
COME ON.

00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:30.030
[laughs]
YEAH, WHY NOT?

00:00:30.063 --> 00:00:31.398
I WAS SURPRISED TO FIND

00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:32.900
THAT I WAS
INCREDIBLY TALENTED

00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:35.035
AT SEPARATING PEOPLE
FROM THEIR BELONGINGS.

00:00:35.068 --> 00:00:36.904
MY GOODNESS.
HEY, IS THAT JUSTIN BIEBER,

00:00:36.937 --> 00:00:38.672
OR DOES SHE JUST
LOOK LIKE HIM?

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:39.940
NO, THAT'S HIM.

00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:42.109
WHAT AN ANGELIC FACE
HE'S GOT.

00:00:42.142 --> 00:00:44.611
THERE WAS NOTHING
I COULD NOT HAVE...

00:00:44.645 --> 00:00:46.246
FOR FREE.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.915
[siren wails]

00:00:55.956 --> 00:00:57.925
[police radio chatter]

00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:00.928
[light classical music]

00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:04.865
â™ª

00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:06.366
- GO!

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.368
- INSPIRED BY MY SUCCESSES
WITH PETTY CRIME,

00:01:08.402 --> 00:01:11.071
I CONVERTED THE <i>REVIEW</i> OFFICES
INTO A STAGING GROUND

00:01:11.104 --> 00:01:12.739
FOR MY MOST AMBITIOUS HEIST YET.

00:01:12.773 --> 00:01:14.107
WE ARE NOT HERE
FOR YOUR MONEY.

00:01:14.141 --> 00:01:15.409
WE ARE HERE
FOR THE BANK'S MONEY,

00:01:15.442 --> 00:01:17.077
WHICH IS FEDERALLY INSURED.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.379
I ENLISTED THE AID OF
MY EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT LUCILLE

00:01:19.413 --> 00:01:21.148
AND OUR OFFICE INTERN JOSH.

00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:22.616
WE WOULD NOT
GO UNPREPARED.

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:25.219
AS WE SAW DURING
THE FISCAL CRISIS OF 2008,

00:01:25.252 --> 00:01:27.254
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
WILL NOT HESITATE

00:01:27.287 --> 00:01:29.156
TO STEP IN AND BAIL OUT
THE BANKS...

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.591
- 30 SECONDS!
- WITH TAXPAYER MONEY, AND--

00:01:30.624 --> 00:01:32.159
WHEN WE DO IT,
I'LL MAKE IT SHORTER.

00:01:32.192 --> 00:01:33.727
IT'S TOO LONG. OKAY.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.295
- IF YOU'RE THE HEAD TELLER,
RAISE YOUR HAND!

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:36.830
- WILL YOU PLEASE
BE THE HEAD TELLER, LUCILLE?

00:01:36.864 --> 00:01:38.932
PLEASE. GOOD. OKAY.
- GREAT.

00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:41.134
OKAY. TAKE ME INTO THE VAULT,
RIGHT NOW!

00:01:41.168 --> 00:01:42.736
NO FUNNY BUSINESS.
- GREAT. WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:45.772
WHERE'S THE VAULT?
- OH, IT'S OVER HERE.

00:01:57.451 --> 00:01:59.419
- THANK YOU.

00:01:59.453 --> 00:02:02.456
- <i>GRACIAS.</i>
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.426
- GOOD. SO YOU'RE HEADED
TO THE VAULT.
