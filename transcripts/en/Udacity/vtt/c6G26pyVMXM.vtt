00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.956
Alright, let's get started. First things first. Make sure you

00:00:03.956 --> 00:00:07.062
get all your ingredients out and ready from the cupboards.

00:00:07.062 --> 00:00:17.062
[MUSIC]

00:00:21.107 --> 00:00:23.957
Now once you have everything out, you're going to want to take

00:00:23.957 --> 00:00:26.408
your rubbing alcohol and put it in the freezer' because

00:00:26.408 --> 00:00:30.510
we're going to need it to be chilled for later. Okay,

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.730
now it's time for you to get your strawberries out. Now,

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.380
if you're like me, you went to the grocery store

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.590
and actually bought some fresh strawberries. Ideally you want your strawberries

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.280
to be. Kind of fresh, but maybe a little mushy,

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.360
a little soft. If they're too hard they have a hard

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.760
time breaking down. You can also, get frozen

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.390
strawberries from your grocery's dessert section. When you thaw

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.490
them, they're really mushy already and you can use

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.380
those. What we're going to do is we're going to

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.660
take our fork. And we're actually going to cut the

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.420
head off the strawberry. We're going to use two strawberries.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.310
I'm going to cut it into a couple of pieces

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.280
here. And now I'm going to get some hot water.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.503
Make sure you run the tap for a little bit first.

00:01:13.503 --> 00:01:16.079
You really want to make sure you got some really warm water.

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:22.815
[MUSIC]

00:01:22.815 --> 00:01:27.125
Okay. You want to add about a quarter of cup of really hot water from the

00:01:27.125 --> 00:01:30.170
tap, into one of your drinking glasses. And

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.624
you're going to drop in your chopped up strawberry.

00:01:33.624 --> 00:01:35.790
[SOUND].

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.680
Come in close, and tell me from these items here, which of the two

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.770
item we're going to add so that we can actually help break up the strawberries.
