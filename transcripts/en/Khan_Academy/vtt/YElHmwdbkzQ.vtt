00:00:00.446 --> 00:00:04.117
- [Voiceover] Let f of
x equal a times x to n

00:00:04.117 --> 00:00:06.474
plus b x plus 12

00:00:06.474 --> 00:00:09.620
over c times x to the m

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.640
plus d x plus 12

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.776
where m and n are integers

00:00:13.776 --> 00:00:17.177
and a, b, c and d are
unknown constants are.

00:00:17.177 --> 00:00:18.477
This is interesting.

00:00:18.477 --> 00:00:22.216
Which of the following is a possible graph

00:00:22.216 --> 00:00:25.199
of y is equal to f of x?

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.892
And it tells us the dashed
lines indicate asymptotes.

00:00:27.892 --> 00:00:30.574
So they gave us four choices here.

00:00:30.574 --> 00:00:32.072
And so I encourage you like always.

00:00:32.072 --> 00:00:32.781
Pause this video.

00:00:32.781 --> 00:00:33.511
Give a go at it.

00:00:33.511 --> 00:00:35.741
See if you can figure
out which of these graphs

00:00:35.741 --> 00:00:38.913
could be the graph for y equals f of x

00:00:38.913 --> 00:00:40.852
where f of x, where they've given us

00:00:40.852 --> 00:00:43.707
this information about f of x.

00:00:43.707 --> 00:00:45.228
All right, now let's
work to this together.

00:00:45.228 --> 00:00:46.308
Now this is really interesting.

00:00:46.308 --> 00:00:48.572
It's, you know, they didn't give us a lot.

00:00:48.572 --> 00:00:50.875
They didn't even tell us
what the exponents on x are.

00:00:50.875 --> 00:00:52.627
They haven't even given
us the coefficients.

00:00:52.627 --> 00:00:55.389
All they've told us is this 12 here.

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:58.374
So this 12 looks like a pretty big clue.

00:00:58.374 --> 00:00:59.923
So what can that tell us?

00:00:59.923 --> 00:01:00.816
The way they've written that

00:01:00.816 --> 00:01:04.845
we really can't deduce any
zeros for the function.

00:01:04.845 --> 00:01:06.589
We really can't deduce what x values

00:01:06.589 --> 00:01:08.296
make the numerator equals zero

00:01:08.296 --> 00:01:11.117
or what x values make the
denominator equal zero.

00:01:11.117 --> 00:01:13.021
So it's gonna be hard for us to deduce

00:01:13.021 --> 00:01:14.657
what are the zeros of the function

00:01:14.657 --> 00:01:16.573
or what are the removable discontinuities

00:01:16.573 --> 00:01:18.314
or what are the vertical asymptotes.

00:01:18.314 --> 00:01:21.437
But just these 12 sitting
here does tell us one thing.

00:01:21.437 --> 00:01:23.979
What happens when x equals zero?

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:26.673
Because when x equal
zero, every other term

00:01:26.673 --> 00:01:28.414
in this rational expression is

00:01:28.414 --> 00:01:30.202
just going to be equal to zero.

00:01:30.202 --> 00:01:32.698
And so we can figure out f of zero.

00:01:32.698 --> 00:01:36.018
F of zero is going to be equal to,

00:01:36.018 --> 00:01:38.235
well a times zero to the n,

00:01:38.235 --> 00:01:40.418
well that's just going to be a zero

00:01:40.418 --> 00:01:42.484
plus b times zero.

00:01:42.484 --> 00:01:44.144
Well, that's just going to be zero.

00:01:44.144 --> 00:01:47.143
Plus 12 over

00:01:48.173 --> 00:01:50.835
c times zero to the m power.

00:01:50.835 --> 00:01:53.017
Well, that's just going to be zero.

00:01:53.017 --> 00:01:56.042
D times zero is going to be a zero.

00:01:56.042 --> 00:01:57.742
And then we have our 12 there.

00:01:57.742 --> 00:01:59.252
So we're actually able to figure out

00:01:59.252 --> 00:02:00.494
what f of zero is.

00:02:00.494 --> 00:02:02.769
It's 12 over 12

00:02:02.769 --> 00:02:04.367
or one.

00:02:04.367 --> 00:02:07.246
So we actually know the y
intercept for this function.

00:02:07.246 --> 00:02:08.848
Let's see if that's enough information

00:02:08.848 --> 00:02:10.821
for us to figure out
if any of these choices

00:02:10.821 --> 00:02:14.769
could be the graph of y equals f of x.

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:16.301
So let's see here.

00:02:16.301 --> 00:02:20.538
So choice a, our y intercept is a two.

00:02:20.538 --> 00:02:23.406
When x equals zero, our graph goes to two.

00:02:23.406 --> 00:02:24.880
So we can rule that out.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.004
The y intercept needs to be one.

00:02:27.004 --> 00:02:29.767
So we can rule out, let's see, choice B

00:02:29.767 --> 00:02:31.625
does have a y intercept.

00:02:31.625 --> 00:02:34.840
It looks just eyeballing it at one,

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.106
x equals zero, y is one.

00:02:36.106 --> 00:02:38.439
So this looks interesting.

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:41.725
Choice C has its y intercept

00:02:41.725 --> 00:02:44.337
at y is equal to negative one.

00:02:44.337 --> 00:02:46.821
So once again, we can rule that out.

00:02:46.821 --> 00:02:50.164
And choice D has no y-intercept at all.

00:02:50.164 --> 00:02:51.999
So that was enough information.

00:02:51.999 --> 00:02:53.659
And lucky for us because
they really didn't give us

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:55.214
a lot more information than just

00:02:55.214 --> 00:02:57.722
what be able to evaluate f of zero.

00:02:57.722 --> 00:02:59.463
We were able to figure
out any of the other,

00:02:59.463 --> 00:03:01.680
you know, the zeros or
the vertical asymptotes

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.375
or their removable discontinuities.

00:03:03.375 --> 00:03:06.672
So we definitely feel
good about that choice.
