RETO MEIER: Hello.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:10.860
My name is Reto Meier, and
welcome to This Week in

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.360
Android Development on Monday,
August 26, 2013.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.560
Last week, Daniel showed us
how to drag and rearrange

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.190
ListView items, and you learned
how easy it is to make

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.740
your apps work well on large
screen displays.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.870
I used strained metaphors to
introduce a series of DevBytes

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.140
on making your app transfers
more efficient by

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.610
understanding the cell radio.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.760
The Android Design in Action
team were at it again with

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.870
their highlight of beautiful
design for summer 2013, and a

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.380
round up of the best seasonal
[INAUDIBLE].

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.750
Our games team knows how to have
a good time, and did so

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.100
on Game On, introducing
the joy and wonder

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.930
of OpenGL ES 3.0.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.120
This week, I'm going to be
here, toasting these.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.250
We've used some magical
boxes to record this

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:50.660
update ahead of time.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.280
Just in case something dramatic
happened over the

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.300
weekend, let me be the first
to welcome our new insect,

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.580
alien, or cyborg overlords.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.350
Those same magic boxes made it
possible for us to film the

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.620
next episode of Efficient Data
Transfers early, and play back

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.280
some tips for analyzing
your transfer profile.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.150
So even if the robot apocalypse
happens, this

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.055
DevByte byte will be available
to watch from the shelter of

00:01:10.055 --> 00:01:11.530
your bunker.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.840
Daniel is also back with another
DevByte, this time

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.460
looking at how to work with
sliding fragments.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.320
In new releases, "Real Racing 3"
has been updated to include

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.460
full Google+ integration.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.240
That's all for This Week
In Android Development.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.290
Be sure to check out this week's
DevBytes, and remember

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.640
that there will be no
sleep till Brooklyn.
