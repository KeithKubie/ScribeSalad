00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
We're looking at two different processes that counteract each other.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The growth of the fish and the harvesting of the fish. Let's ignore harvesting for the moment.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
A simple assumption about the growth would be that the amount of fish increases year by year

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
by the same percentage similar to compound interest.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
To make things simple, we are measuring the amount of fish

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
as a number of tons not by counting.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Here is a quiz for you. Let's not include harvesting.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
What should the right of change of the amount of fish be: 0.5 per ton times the amount of fish

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:44.000
minus 4 * 10⁵ years per ton, or minus 0.5 per year times the amount of fish

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000
plus 4 * 10⁵ tons per year, or plus 0.5 per year times the amount of fish

00:00:51.000 --> 09:59:59.000
minus 4 * 10⁵ tons per year.
