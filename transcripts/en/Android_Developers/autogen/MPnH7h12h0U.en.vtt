 [MUSIC PLAY] 

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.120
 DANIEL BARRETO: Haystack TV started in 2013 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.500
 as a new venture from Stanford StartX accelerator. 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.390
 We were frustrated with how news is being distributed, 

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:15.080
 because every time we turn on the TV, 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.610
 we had to watch the same news as everyone else. 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:20.740
 Our angle here at Haystack TV 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.520
 is that we enable people to do that 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.310
 watch news they care about. 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.570
 One of the decisions we had to make at the beginning 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.400
 was what platform we had to start with. 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.010
 As a small new business, we needed a platform 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.659
 which would allow us to repeat quickly. 

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:33.927
 We got it with Android. 

00:00:33.927 --> 00:00:35.510
 ISH HARSHAWAT: The team at Haystack TV 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:36.926
 love working with Android. 

00:00:36.926 --> 00:00:40.140
 The documentation is very clear and easy to use. 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.642
 It can be fun to program for Android. 

00:00:42.642 --> 00:00:44.350
 DANIEL BARRETO: Our users wanted the news 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.940
 in their living rooms, on their TVs. 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.490
 And there wasn't a platform out there for them to do it. 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.780
 ISH HARSHAWAT: Many of the smart TVs to date 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.630
 are quite wealthy closed systems 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.560
 to which developers like us hard to get access. 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.140
 With Android TV we could finally penetrate 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.220
 into the living room. 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.790
 Although a developer can easily take their mobile application 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.090
 And sitting on Android TV, we found it to work very well 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.700
 to actually design a first-for-Android TV type experience. 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.240
 It was very fast to develop for Android TV. 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.780
 We did it literally in two weeks. 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.530
 DANIEL BARRETO: We've seen incredible results 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.960
 after we integrated with Android TV and Chromecast. 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.390
 Our mobile users initially 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.740
 an average of 40 minutes a week 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.860
 spend watching the news. 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.580
 Now we've doubled it. 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.020
 Our growth path is very strong at the moment. 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.230
 We managed to grow more than 40% month-on-month 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.100
 since we started. 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.490
 And much of it is the integration with the TVs. 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.445
 It's a new beta test feature that released Android. 

00:01:44.445 --> 00:01:49.250
 This allowed us to reach our early beta and alpha testers. 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.990
 And that also allowed us to integrate with Google+, 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.110
 so that we can reach different communities of early contractors. 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.800
 It was incredibly powerful for us. 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.440
 A small business like ours is now making a big impact 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.960
 with just six people, reaching out to millions of users. 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.910
 And many of them are due to the tools and platforms 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.360
 what we have with Google.
