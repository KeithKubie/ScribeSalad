00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.460
&gt;&gt; Talia Guzman-Gonzales: On behalf
of the Hispanic division I would

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:33.960
like to welcome everyone
to this beautiful room.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.040 position:56%
It's quite a treat for me to be here

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.700
so I hope you appreciate
that as well.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:45.050
This is the Rosenwald
Room of the Rare Book

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:52.210
and Special Collection Division

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:58.910
who also helped us collect this
wonderful display that we're going

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:05.710
to be talking about after the talk.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:13.050
As you know this year we celebrate
the 400 anniversary of the death

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:18.530
of Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra,
the author of "Don Quixote",

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:24.810
first novel reaching the modern
world and published in 1605

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:34.750
and today you get to see one of
those 1605 editions so it's--

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.160
&gt;&gt; Oh my.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.610
&gt;&gt; Talia Guzman-Gonzales:
pretty exciting.

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.600
The Library of Congress has an
unparalleled collection of editions

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.970
of "Don Quixote" and other
miscellany including two definitive

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.570
editions, one pirated in Portugal

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.030
and another published
by the author in Spain.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.880
The library also has
the translations--

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.360
all the translations

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.690
to "Don Quixote" including a
beautifully illustrated edition

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.050
in [inaudible] that we
couldn't bring today

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:12.500
but we have another event
on "Don Quixote" in December

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.750
and we'll have that then.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:26.120
Researchers who would like to learn
more about our collection can start

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.660
by [inaudible] book where we,
it's a collection of the books of,

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.320
by Miguel de Cervantes in
the Library of Congress.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.320
So today we have the pleasure

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:45.270
of welcoming Professor Hernan
Sanchez Martinez de Pinillos

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.610

at the University of Maryland.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.070
&gt;&gt; Whoo!

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.780

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.870 position:56%
He has a Masters in Philosophy and a
PhD in Spanish Golden Age Literature

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.170
from Columbia University
in New York.

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.780
He is corresponding member for the
Spanish Royal Academy of History

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.190 position:56%
since 2012 and a Member Collaborator

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.290 position:56%
of Cilengua Centro Internactional de
Investigacion de la Lengua Espanola.

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.590
He has published a
scholarly edition and study

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.110
of a 15th century manuscript
and numerous articles

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.410
in prestigious journals
on major works of Spanish

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:18.720
and Latin American
Literature including Cervantes,

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.020
Lope de Vega and Quevedo.

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.320 position:56%
Currently he's working, or he's

Quevedo y la tradicion occidental",

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.250
and "Cervantes and Edgar
Allen Poe in Counterpoint".

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.800
After Professor de Pinillos' talk
we're going to have my colleague

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.660
from the Hispanic Division Juan
Manuel Perez is going to be talking

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:28.960
about some of the rare
editions that we have here

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.260
at the Library of Congress.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.560
So I hope you'll stay
for that as well.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.860
So welcome, Hernan.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.160 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Hernan Pinillos: Thank you very
much all of you for being here today

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.460
on a rainy Friday afternoon.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:36.760
Thank you very much Dr. Georgette
Dorn from the Hispanic Division

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.060 position:56%
and thank you Talia and thank you
[talking in foreign language] from--

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.830
[ Inaudible ]

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:41.310
&gt;&gt; Hernan Pinillos: That was?

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.520
Okay. Yeah I was thanking Dr.
Georgette Dorn for the opportunity

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:52.090
to commemorate Cervantes'
anniversary--

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.260
the anniversary of his
death and Talia and the head

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.890
of the Hispanic department also for
well, yeah, contributing to this,

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.770
the possibility of this event.

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.990
I'm going to be talking
a bit about the invention

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:12.680
of the character Don Quixote, how
the novel presents this character

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.610
and the construction of the
novel and then the projection

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:22.250
of "Don Quixote" throughout
the ages in different context.

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.260 position:56%
In the opening chapter of Cervantes'

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.170
"Don Quixote" we meet a middle aged
small town bachelor whose life is

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:33.770
defined by its monotony
and invisibility.

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.440
He lives with his young
niece and with a housekeeper.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.040
He has but two friends.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.000
His name is Alonso
Quijano or Quijada.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.960
Alonso has no productive activity
to occupy his fertile imagination.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.890
As we are informed
of the dull details

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.660
of a poor hidalgo's
everyday life we learn

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.560
that his only distinctive feature
is that he devotes all his time,

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.640
day and night, to the task of
absorbing books of chivalry

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.040
to the point of obsession.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.920
Ignoring their [inaudible]
distinction between history

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:11.750 position:56%
and poetry, Alonso Quijano loses
himself in books of fiction he deems

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.580
to be histories of facts.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.130
In the madness of reading
fictional literature as history,

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:23.510
Alonso Quijano begins to imagine
the script for his own life.

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:28.280
And at this point something
remarkable occurs.

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:34.090 position:56%
Quijano begins moving out of himself
as he formulates a new life project

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.850
in the form of a real
character of his own invention.

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:43.590
We as readers are present as
Alonso Quijano reinvents himself.

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:48.850
The character invented by the
author is presented to the reader

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:53.990
in his intimate process of
transformation and self invention.

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.420
A main character invented
by Cervantes,

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:00.870
Alonso Quijano recreates himself
as the knight Don Quixote.

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:07.790
By naming himself-- it takes a week
to think of his name, Don Quixote--

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:12.930
Alonso Quijano literally wills
himself into a new existence.

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.200
In a sort of reproduction
of the baptismal sacrament,

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:21.160
an outer baptism of sorts as
some critics have termed it,

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.970
Alonso Quijano's madness and
conversion are here inseparable.

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:29.190
Madness is conversion and
conversion is madness.

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:34.270
We can recall all the famous
religious conversions of the past.

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:36.730
St. Paul, St. Augustine,
St. Francis.

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:41.080
But even more relevant are
Ignatius of Loyola and Santa Teresa

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.490
who are great readers
of chivalry novels.

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:47.320
Ignatius of Loyola read romances
of chivalry while convalescing

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:52.330
from a wound, and the
religious order he created,

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:58.820
the Jesuit Society, was to be
a sort of spiritual knighthood.

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:00.980
So you see the parallels.

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:05.060
The stated cause of Alonso
Quijano's conversion is reading,

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:10.490 position:56%
but the underlining causes have been
described differently by critics.

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:11.790
Midlife crisis.

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:13.090
Boredom. Love.

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:14.390
Fear of old age.

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:18.300
The will to leave behind an
empty and meaningless existence.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:23.910
And thus the knight Don
Quijano, the hero of a tale

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:26.470
of chivalry is being born.

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:30.800
From now on his life will be an
imitation of art and an attempt

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.670
in transforming life into art.

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:37.520
Ortega said, whose philosophical
system was born as a commentary

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:42.210 position:56%
of "Don Quixote" in 1914 in the book
"Meditaciones del Quijote" wrote

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:48.890 position:56%
in 1935 in [inaudible] that whether
he be original or a plagiarist man--

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:56.380
man or and women-- or women, are
the novelist of him or herself.

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:59.290
Women and men are continually
rewriting themselves

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:03.490
after becoming dissatisfied
with older versions,

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:06.520
with their older versions and then
revising their previous selves

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.440
into someone new.

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:11.930
Bored of being the
invisible man Alonso Quijano,

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:15.460
the ostracized non-entity
Alonso Quijano the great reader

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:19.620
of novels will die to be reborn
as the author of his own story,

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:21.850
the novelist of his own existence.

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:28.490 position:56%
A life titled "The Ingenious Hidalgo
Don Quixote de la Mancha" [talking

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:32.900
in foreign language], a title that
is both absurd and subversive.

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:37.340
The adjective ingenious doesn't
usually qualify the noun hidalgo,

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:41.430
a social category of lower nobility
whose distinctive mark like that

00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:43.690
of all nobility would be courage.

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:47.650
In the medical treatises of
the times, men of high wit,

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:50.080
[talking in foreign
language] were described

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:53.920
as having a precarious
psychological balance.

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.600
[Talking in foreign language]
was typically accompanied

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:59.560
by some sort of mania, no?

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:05.800
So this is a strange
juxtaposition, no?

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.100
[Talking in foreign
language] After [talking

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:12.830
in foreign language] comes the
honorific title Don [talking

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:14.130
in foreign language] .

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:17.400
Together Hidalgo and Don
represent a contradiction.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:23.180
This is a socially subversive
equalitarian absurdity.

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:26.960
Usurping the title Don, reserved
for the upper classes of the,

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.830
the real upper ranks
of the nobility,

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:32.540
our hero's promoting himself
from the class of the hidalgo,

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:35.870
the lowest rung of the
nobility to that of a caballero.

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:41.410
Those who could introduce their
first name with the title, Don.

00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:47.700
So, [talking in foreign
language] is completely an absurd

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:49.620
and also subversive title.

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:56.690 position:56%
Here the Don is related to caballero
and caballero has a double meaning

00:09:56.690 --> 00:10:00.040
in the mind of Don Quixote.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:02.990
Well in the mind of Don Quixote
it represents a night in--

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:06.020
a night errant, a knight
in shining armor.

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:10.880
But caballero is also a social
rank, so here you see the conflict,

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.740
the misadjustment between
literature and life

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:17.160
that will characterize
all of "Don Quixote".

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:21.580
The social meaning of Don pulls
the character back into the reality

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:26.610
of contemporary Spain in 1600
even as he attempts to escape

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:33.740
that reality into literature,
escaping into literature.

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:36.880
The antithesis between
the fake Don title

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.860
and the hidalgo condition
is followed

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:42.430
by the augmentative Quixote.

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:45.030
Derived from the pejorative
suffix ote modeled

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:47.140
after the last name Quijano.

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:49.520
Don should antecede the first name,

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:53.040
as in Don Alonso, or
in Don [inaudible].

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.390
So we have here another absurdity.

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:59.150
The name Quixote is derived
from the last name Quijano

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:02.410
but in Spanish surnames
derived from first names.

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:05.630
Sanchez originally
meant son of Sancho.

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:08.130
Gonzales, son of Gonzalo and so on.

00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:12.490
And the name Don Quixote
the normal linguistic

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:15.590
and historical process
has been inverted.

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:19.240
The first name is derived
from the family name.

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:23.630
So the aberration of the title Don
with a surname, the family Quijano

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:25.830
or Quijada affix in the
manner corresponding

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:28.770
to a given name is the
onomastic expression

00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:32.390
of the protagonist
subversive madness.

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:34.820
The name Quixote is
most probably derived

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:37.020
from the [inaudible] word [talking
in foreign language] a piece

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:39.370
of armor that covered the thigh.

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:43.320
Don Quixote is modeled after Sir
Lancelot, King Arthur's champion

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:46.500
with whom Don Quixote
will prove to be obsessed.

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.220
But instead of an offensive
armor like the lance eluded

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:53.360
to in the name Lancelot, Quixote
refers to a defensive armor

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.780
that covers the area
around the genitals

00:11:55.780 --> 00:12:02.370 position:56%
which has inspired quite a few
several psychoanalytic readings, no?

00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:05.880
So then we have "El Ingenioso
hidalgo don Quixote de la Mancha",

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:07.180
no?

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:11.150
De la Mancha in contrast with
the exotic beautiful landscapes

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:15.130
of idealized romance novels, Don
Quixote hails from the parched,

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:20.260
uninteresting, dry plains of
la Mancha and central Spain.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.850
In imitation of Amadis who
hails from Gaula, Wales,

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:26.020
Don Quixote incorporates
his homeland de la Mancha

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:27.830
into his name as well.

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:32.370
The associations that de la Mancha
convey are opposed to the enchanted

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:38.550
and exotic faraway lands of
the original chivalry knights.

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:41.850
Furthermore, la Mancha
has a double meaning.

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:45.870
It refers to this dry
region south of Madrid,

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:50.200
but mancha also means stain which
could imply of converse origin,

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:53.290
not of pure blood, in
another possible jab

00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:59.070
at the established
order's ideological system.

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:03.540
Well if Cervantes creates
Dulcinea who has--

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:05.640
I'm sorry, if Cervantes
creates Alonso Quijano

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:07.120
who has created Don Quixote,

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:10.260
Don Quixote in turn
invents the fair Dulcinea

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.480
from a [inaudible] according
to Sanchos' description,

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.550
peasant girl from neighboring
[talking in foreign language] .

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:21.340
The romantic and existentialist
versions of Dulcinea has become,

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:24.060
they have become popularized
as explained

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:28.320
by the Spanish philosopher
Miguel de Unamuno.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:31.300
The causes of this
love affair as follows.

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:34.170
Idleness and an unfortunate
love affair led him

00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:36.820 position:56%
to reading books of knight errantry.

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:42.300 position:56%
And after several pages of extolling
Dulcinea's [inaudible] of glory,

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:46.900
Unamuno addresses "Don Quixote"
as follow: And now my Don Quixote,

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:49.480
take me somewhere where we can
be alone together for I want

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:53.920 position:56%
to have a heart to heart talk and
speak to you as many men do not care

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:55.560
to speak even to themselves.

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:58.230
Was it really your love of glory
that led you to invest [inaudible]

00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:02.340 position:56%
of whom for a while you were
enamored with the image of Dulcinea?

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:06.360
Or was it your unhappy love for
the commonly young peasant girl,

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:10.980
the love which she never heard of
nor paid any heed to which turned

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:14.370
into love of immortality?

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:18.500
So Don Quixote's love quest for
Dulcinea will be, as you know,

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:22.230 position:56%
one of the main drives of the novel.

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:24.400
And so how is Don Quixote born?

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:30.930
How is the character set
out on the roads of Spain?

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:33.800
Well he is born free from baggage.

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:36.210
A new man in a 50 year olds body

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:39.210
who in his madness believes
he is a knight errant.

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:43.390
A new identity is anachronistic
both from a historical

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:45.830
and from a biographical
point of view.

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:48.030
As his niece will point
out in the beginning

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:50.440
of part two, Don Quixote
is obsolete.

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.650
His materials conditions,
age, physique,

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:56.850
social and economic
circumstances make him unsuitable

00:14:56.850 --> 00:14:59.490
for his intended life project.

00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:03.630
Very little is known of the
protagonist's 50 first years.

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:07.330
We do know that he, that as he
approached his late 40's he turned

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:09.180
to reading novels of chivalry.

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:13.690
But Cervantes offers us
nothing, or next to nothing.

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:17.270
Old book without a
past we know nothing

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:20.200
about his parents nor
his birthplace.

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.500
Why is this?

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:24.440
What is Cervantes' purpose?

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:30.180 position:56%
Alonso Quijano has been a non-entity
for almost 50 years as we said,

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:31.820
and the [inaudible] regarded--

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:35.990
as the [inaudible] regarding the
protagonist's names underscores.

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:45.860
But this lack of a past
allows the author to create,

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:49.980
to give us a character with
greater freedom of movements.

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:54.900
He evades predestination, present
in the heroic, aristocratic,

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:58.820
idealized romances of chivalry,
and also the determinism

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:04.490
of the anti-heroic picaresque
novels with their materialistic

00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:07.380
and pessimistic anthropology
that foreshadows

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:09.930
in many ways social Darwinism.

00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:12.400
A symbolic understanding
of Don Quixote's lack

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:17.140 position:56%
of early life history can be seen as
the expression of all that is new,

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:20.620 position:56%
the importance of the future instead
of the past, of the possibility

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:26.570
of self creation, self recreation
versus social conformism,

00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:32.030
a slap in the face of the
established order once again.

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:37.360
Don Quixote's born as an act
of independence of a new kind

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:40.390
of hero, heterodox and alone.

00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:45.660 position:56%
And so in chapter two the
imposter, the self appointed knight,

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:47.120
Don Quixote de la Mancha will set

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:51.830
out on his adventures
one hot July morning.

00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:55.390
Don Quixote breaks away from
his past, from the monotonous

00:16:55.390 --> 00:17:02.140
and predicable existence of his
small town of 50 year old life

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:08.420
and he is born to run on the road
less traveled and breaking bad.

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:10.900
Because Don Quixote
will be excommunicating

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:12.630
for attacking a funeral procession.

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:16.040
Don Quixote will become an
outlaw after setting free a group

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:18.620
of [inaudible] dangerous
prisoners in shackles.

00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:23.870
But Don Quixote does
have, in spite of this,

00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:26.060
a strong ethical and
aesthetic system.

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:30.610
A complex personal creation made
up of the heroic code of romances

00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:33.850
of chivalry, of the perfect
courtly lover infused

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:37.030
with biblical ancient
Greek and Christian values.

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:41.050
In his self invention, Don Quixote
will rely on two famous sentences

00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:44.760
that will carry him and
Sancho through the novel

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:46.700
to Barcelona and back home.

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:50.680
The first one is, "each person
is the heir of his own actions"

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:54.280
or more literally, "each person
is the child of his own words".

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:56.380 position:56%
The Spanish for this well known line
is [talking in foreign language].

00:17:56.380 --> 00:18:03.320 position:56%
To a Spanish [inaudible] cannot fail
to invite comparisons with [talking

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:05.200
in foreign language]
literally son of something

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:09.550
and more appropriately
translated as son of somebody.

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:12.120
[Talking in foreign language]
was subsequently shortened

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:17.020
into hidalgo meaning gentleman.

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:21.640 position:56%
Since hidalgo explained one's status
as deriving from one's ancestors,

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:25.370 position:56%
the countering assertion that each
one is [talking in foreign language]

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:28.470
that is, each one's worth is a
result of what he does rather

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:31.620
than what forbearers
did or were have reputed

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:37.030 position:56%
to have done is an expression of
more than idle observation in an age

00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:43.850 position:56%
which antedates the first successful
social revolutions in Europe.

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:49.900 position:56%
[talking in foreign language]
reflects a manner of valiant people,

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:53.070
not by social status
or popular esteem

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:56.210
but by their true moral worth.

00:18:56.210 --> 00:19:01.280
The other sentence that founds Don
Quixote's personal ethical system

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:06.110
is, "I know who I am and who I
could become", said by Don Quixote

00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:11.280
to his neighbor Pedro Alonzo in
the fifth chapter of the first part

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:14.980
when his neighbor finds the
knight confused and beaten up

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:17.340
and referring to books of chivalry.

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:20.580
The peasant, baffled by these
words uttered with such conviction,

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:24.500
will manage to escort Don
Quixote back to his village.

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:28.300
[Talking in foreign language]
said in a different context,

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:34.190
trite as it may seem to us, a
logical statement of identity,

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:36.730
I am I, the fundamental
statement of consciousness is

00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:40.120 position:56%
in reality a tremendous achievement.

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:45.270
In Don Quixote's phrase,
it can be read

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:48.090
and has been read alongside
other defining religious, moral,

00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:51.140
existential and philosophical
maxims no?

00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:54.320
I am who I am, Exodus 3:14.

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:57.440
Pindar's, become whom you are.

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:59.820
Socrates, know thyself.

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:01.190 position:56%
Polonius, to thine own self be true.

00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:05.370
Descartes, you know, I
think therefore I am.

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:08.430
Spanish philosophers
Unamuno and Ortega y Gasset

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:12.180
who both kick-started their own
systems of thought as a meditated

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:16.550
of Cervantes' novel commented
intensely this phrase

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:20.110
in an existentialist context.

00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:24.040
Ortega founded his
concept of the heroic

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:28.800
on what he deemed Don
Quixote's courageous will

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:31.370
to resist the pressures
that will lead him

00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:34.180
to lead an inauthentic existence.

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:38.680
Hero for Ortega is he
or she who discovers

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:42.640
and affirms her original self
against all social conventions,

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:47.150
obstacles, prejudices,
conventions, or expectations.

00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:51.630
What is extraordinary is that
Don Quixote joins from the outset

00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:56.160
of the novel the aspiration to
take action to self knowledge.

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:57.460
Other famous characters believe

00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:00.260
that an individual
designs his own fortune.

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.390
In Shakespeare, Iago
and Hamlet for instance.

00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:06.480
But only Don Quixote links self
realization to self knowledge.

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:12.630
The following quote from a
popular best seller self help book,

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:16.380
this quote really captures
the essence

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:21.140
of the romantic existentialist
tradition of Quixote commentary.

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:27.680
The book is "I Will Not Die an
Unlived Life" by Dawna Markova.

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:29.840
Through fear of knowing
who we really are,

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:33.170
we sidestep our own destiny
which leaves us hungry

00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:35.280
in a famine for our own making.

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:38.520
We end up living numb,
passionless lives disconnected

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:40.420
from our soul's true purpose.

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:43.370
But when we have the
courage to say--

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:47.290
but when we have the courage to
save our life from the essence

00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:52.010
of who we are, we ignite
becoming truly alive.

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:55.380
But Don Quixote is not alone.

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:59.380
In chapter seven he [inaudible]
himself with a squire for he,

00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:04.940
for which he chooses a peasant from
his village named Sancho Panza.

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:09.250
Sancho Panza is everything Don
Quixote is not and vice versa.

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:13.010
Everybody, including people
who have never read the book,

00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:17.350
know that Don Quixote's tall and
thin, Sancho's short and fat.

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:21.400
The word Panza means
potbelly in Spanish.

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:23.660
Don Quixote is a very
minor aristocrat.

00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:24.960
Sancho a commoner.

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:26.260
Don Quixote's a great reader.

00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:30.430
In fact this is what
makes him Don Quixote.

00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:33.820
Whereas Sancho is an
illiterate peasant.

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:37.920
Sancho becomes, belongs to
the culture of [inaudible].

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:41.890
He opposes the great body of folk
wisdom crystallizing proverbs

00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:46.250
to Don Quixote's reliance
on written text.

00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:49.750
So there will be a
continuous contrast

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:53.150
between Don Quixote's
expansive literary imagination

00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:55.870
and Sancho's common sense.

00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:59.800
Don Quixote champions the
personalism of feudalism

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:02.050 position:56%
with its reciprocal and abstract set

00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:06.620
of mutual obligations while Sancho
yearns for a relationship based

00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:08.870
on and mediated by money.

00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:13.680
But these are not of
course absolute oppositions.

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:16.730
George Orwell in an
article entitled,

00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:22.270
"The Art of Donald McGill",
observed that two principles--

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:24.170
noble folly and base wisdom--

00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:27.770
exist side by side in
nearly every human being.

00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:30.650
If you look into your
own mind, which are you,

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:32.820
Don Quixote or Sancho Panza?

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:34.730
Almost certainly you are both.

00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:37.410
There is one part of you that
wishes to be a hero or a saint

00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:39.740
but another part of
you is a little man

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:44.470 position:56%
who sees very clearly the advantages
of staying alive with a whole skin.

00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:46.060
He is your unofficial self,

00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:48.780
the voice of the belly
protesting against the soul.

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:52.930
It is simply a lie to say
that he is not part of you,

00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:59.020
just as is it a lie-- just as it
is a lie to say that Don Quixote,

00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:04.230
that Don Quixote's not
a part of you either.

00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:09.030
So Don Quixote will be based
on the unending conversations,

00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:16.390
exchanges between Sancho
Panza and his master.

00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:20.730
In contrast with the Picaresque
novel and its monological world

00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:23.100
of survival, isolation,
and loneliness,

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:26.880 position:56%
in Don Quixote the dialogue allows
both characters to define themself--

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:29.560
themselves, and influence
each other.

00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:34.010
A dialogue always assumes
a certain degree

00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:36.300
of equality between the speakers.

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:38.450
The opposite of a dialogue
is the sermon,

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:40.780
the harangued official speech.

00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:47.150
Europe as you know was divided
into strict social classes

00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:49.510
and that class rigidity
made dialogue

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:53.250
across lines extremely difficult.

00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:55.520
But Cervantes created a
situation in his novel

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:59.020
that required a constant
crossing of class lines

00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:03.850
in the continuous dialogue
between a peasant and an hidalgo.

00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:05.590
It would be hard or
perhaps impossible

00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:10.150 position:56%
to find a similar situation in prose
writings in Spain or elsewhere.

00:25:10.150 --> 00:25:15.630
It is true that we have
in Spanish place many,

00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:19.430
many a place with the
archetypical funny man [inaudible]

00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:24.080
who had criticized the
behavior of young nobles.

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:31.850
But this group of plays categorized
as comedias, a genre favored

00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:36.840
by local hidalga and
other playwrights.

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:42.940 position:56%
In these comedias [inaudible]
criticism was on the whole discarded

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:45.870
by the play's upper
class characters.

00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:48.800
[Talking in foreign language]
would connect with the audience

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:56.030
who would laugh at him when
he pokes fun at the noble

00:25:56.030 --> 00:26:01.180
but incomprehensible
ideals of the upper classes.

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:04.570
Because he could not understand
their motivations nor their values.

00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:09.330
So the Spanish plays have been
described as a dialogue of the deaf

00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:12.370
in terms of social classes.

00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:18.930
In Cervantes' novel it's-- on the
contrary it is a constant exchange

00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:23.450
between the authority
figure of Don Quixote

00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:28.630
and the illiterate Sancho Panza
who has on his sides facts

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:36.990
and common sense, what
will carry the novel.

00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:40.110
Language communicates,
reveals the inner self

00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:42.340
of one's character to another.

00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:45.360
Never in literature had dialogue
and conversation been shown

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:49.290 position:56%
as so integral to experience before.

00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:53.170
Don Quixote and Sancho
never talk past each other.

00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:56.760
They listen carefully and adjust
their answers accordingly.

00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:00.950
And their unending
polemic conversations

00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:06.540
and winning camaraderie and
true bonding will culminate

00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:12.390 position:56%
in a true friendship expressed in a
letter that Don Quixote will address

00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:14.990
to Sancho Panza in the
second part of the novel

00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:20.860
that he will sign simply
as "your friend".

00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:27.710
We can, from a more abstract point
of view we can see in this portents

00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:32.390
of the dialogue, a protest
against dogmatism, against the idea

00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:41.060
of a static, unidimensional
world view, you know?

00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:45.450
Cervantes' novel is structured
as a dialogue on the road

00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:49.130
and an outward journey with
several stays at an inn or a castle

00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:52.640
with numerous encounters with
people of all social levels.

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:56.600
But this journey is also a tour
through all the literary regions

00:27:56.600 --> 00:28:00.410
of the imagination known in
the early 17th century Spain.

00:28:00.410 --> 00:28:04.860 position:56%
"Don Quixote" simultaneously
incorporates into itself and carries

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:08.590
on a dialogue with all
the forms of fictional

00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:14.140
and non-fictional literature
current in that time.

00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:17.090
Professions of literature, and that
includes both writers and critics,

00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:20.100
consider "Don Quixote" at the
center of the history of the novel.

00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:24.650
It includes and sums up
everything that went before it.

00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:29.630
[Inaudible] essay in the prologue,
[inaudible] and chivalry novels

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:32.760
in the form of parody, the
pastoral and picaresque novels,

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:36.410
byzantine novels, Italian
humanism, Spanish mysticism,

00:28:36.410 --> 00:28:43.330 position:56%
the perfect tragedy and prose, comic
plays, [inaudible] sonnets, ballads

00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:45.180
and burlesque poems, etcetera.

00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:49.260
No book owes so much for
existing literature and no book is

00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:55.420
so different from that literature
wrote Carroll B. Johnson.

00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:59.050
So as Don Quixote the character
breaks away from his past,

00:28:59.050 --> 00:29:01.020
as he broke away from
his past and refused

00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:04.350
to accept the social role
handed to him by his ancestors

00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:08.350
and his environment, Cervantes
the author will break away

00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:13.910
from all forms of literary
imagination once he has absorbed

00:29:13.910 --> 00:29:19.120
them and proven that he
could write excellently

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:23.500
in all those different
genres and forms.

00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:25.750
The second part of
Cervantes can be--

00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:29.230
the second part of the novel can
be described as Cervantes' act

00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:30.680
of independence from tradition.

00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:36.370
After proving like later young
Picasso that he could model

00:29:36.370 --> 00:29:43.120
and excel-- he could excel in every
mode known of literary imagination.

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:44.930
But Don Quixote of course

00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:50.400
as you know not only sums
what has been written before,

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:53.690
but also projects itself
into the future.

00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:57.040
As [inaudible] observed, all the
ideas of western novel are present

00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:59.180
in [inaudible] in "Don Quixote".

00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:02.610
From "Joseph Andrews" written
in the manner of Cervantes

00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:05.560
by Henry Fielding, to Charlotte
Lennox's "The Female Quixote",

00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:08.730
from Tabitha Tenney's
"Female Quixoticism"

00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:10.920
and most popular novel
written in America prior

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:12.900
to the publication of
"Uncle Tom's Cabin".

00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:19.390 position:56%
From "Moby Dick" and "Madame
Bovary" to Dostoevsky's "The Idiot",

00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:23.400
from "The Great Gatsby"
and the novels of Galdos

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:28.000
to "Huckleberry Finn" and Faulkner
and Kathy Acker's "Don Quixote"

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.050
which was a dream, novelists had
been exploiting and experimenting

00:30:31.050 --> 00:30:33.110
with the possibilities inherent

00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:37.190
in what Harry Levin called
the Cervantine principle.

00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:41.550
Every novel bears a Quixote within
it like an inner filigree just

00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:44.400
as every epic poem contains
"The Iliad", like the fruit,

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:48.930
its core observed Ortega
y Gasset in 1914.

00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:54.140
[Inaudible] imagination observed
that "Don Quixote" contains

00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:57.570
within itself the whole
potentiality of the genre,

00:30:57.570 --> 00:31:01.390
and that the entire history of the
novel could be justifiably thought

00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:04.420
as iteration of the
theme of Don Quixote.

00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:06.590
The old opposition between
reality and appearance,

00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:10.340
between what merely is
and what merely seems.

00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:13.880
Here are some of the lessons
created and passed on by Cervantes

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:18.640
to later novels: the
anti-hero as protagonist

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:21.710
and a new understanding of heroism.

00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:24.740
The celebration of freedom through
the poetics, authors, narrators,

00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:29.990
characters, readers, and the
anthropology of the novel.

00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:33.470
The conflict between inner
conscience and the outside world.

00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:36.810
The antithesis between
imagination and the pragmatic,

00:31:36.810 --> 00:31:38.780
or between poetry and prose.

00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:42.580
The inclusion of all social
levels of language and the renewal

00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:46.230
of rhetoric through the
omnipresence of spoken language.

00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:49.500
The fusion of travel and dialogue
is a commentary both critical

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:51.780
and compassionate on humanity.

00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:55.300
The alternation of adventure
and experience, and of humor

00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:58.150
and philosophical depth,
the truth of fiction

00:31:58.150 --> 00:32:01.550
versus the fictitious
appearance of reality.

00:32:01.550 --> 00:32:04.090
The questioning of the
relation between what happened--

00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:07.930
the story, and the account of
what happened-- the discourse.

00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:11.050
The art of capturing a person's
faith in a single phrase.

00:32:11.050 --> 00:32:15.540
The invention of a myth that
springs from a core of a culture,

00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:18.230
from the core of a culture.

00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:22.650
The novel as a self reflecting
genre through irony, playfulness,

00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:26.390
and parody and the
development of meta-fiction.

00:32:26.390 --> 00:32:30.950
"Don Quixote" intertwined stories
and different levels of fiction,

00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:32.250
literature within literature,

00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:33.860
written by numerous
internal authors.

00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:35.850
The first author, the second author

00:32:35.850 --> 00:32:39.530
and unreliable narrator
named [talking

00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:40.830
in foreign language] historian,

00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:44.460
the Morisco translators,
the Morisco translator.

00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:48.360
But also many of the
characters are writers as well.

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:52.080
The [talking in foreign language]
the lovers and poets [talking

00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:55.880
in foreign language] the captain
who chronicles his life as captain

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:59.360
in Algiers, the [inaudible] from
Toledo who writes chivalry novels

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:02.710
and Don Quixote himself as a
character in search of an author

00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:04.890
who will write down his deeds.

00:33:04.890 --> 00:33:09.070
Cervantes creates a meta-fiction
in which the massive presence

00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:13.480
of literature is complemented by a
series of theoretical discussions

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:14.800
on the art of literature.

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:16.420
Arising as a natural consequence

00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:20.630
of Don Quixote's strange
literature-based madness.

00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:23.260
From the 9th chapter of the first
part, Don Quixote will be the story

00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:28.830
of the fictional protagonist
and what happens to them.

00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:31.260
And simultaneously a meditation
on the nature and modes

00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:33.410
of invention of a literary text.

00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:37.170
That is, "Don Quixote" is a novel
about the adventures of Don Quixote

00:33:37.170 --> 00:33:42.010
and Sancho and a book about the
adventure of writing "Don Quixote".

00:33:42.010 --> 00:33:45.880
In the second part of the novel,
the characters become readers

00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:49.170
of the first part and
discuss literature

00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:51.470
as though they the invented
characters were as real

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:54.670
as the author and us the readers.

00:33:54.670 --> 00:33:59.710
Pirandello and Unamuno-- Pirandello
in "Six Characters in Search

00:33:59.710 --> 00:34:01.520
of an Author" and Unamuno
in his novel [inaudible]

00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:04.430
"Mist" will take Cervantes'
strategy to the limit

00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:07.150
and make the character
more real than the author,

00:34:07.150 --> 00:34:10.790
rebel against said author.

00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:14.820
Meta-fiction is a narrative
form of metaphysical questioning

00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:17.940
which makes us ponder our
own place in the world.

00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:21.660
And as [inaudible] observed
in the, in his essay [talking

00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:26.590
in foreign language] it unsettles
the reader's own reality principle.

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:29.820
According to [inaudible]
Don Quixote's legacy is

00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:31.580
that the novelist teachers
the reader how

00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:34.340
to comprehend the world
as a question.

00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:39.880
And last but not least,
Cervantes gave us a literary form

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:42.890
where a character undergoes
deep inner development

00:34:42.890 --> 00:34:44.510
and transformation.

00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:47.130
From conversion and
madness to lucidity

00:34:47.130 --> 00:34:51.790
and reckless spiritual youth
to wise disillusionment.

00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:55.180
Cervantes promises in the
prologue of the second part

00:34:55.180 --> 00:34:59.940
to give the reader "Don
Quixote" character [talking

00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:04.880

versus the arrested development

00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:07.720
of the wooden characters
in bad novels such as

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:09.840
"The False Quixote" written

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:13.990
by Cervantes' mysterious enemy
Alonso Fernandez Avellaneda.

00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:19.260 position:56%
The Quixote of part two is a changed
man and the novel can be read

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:22.600
as the growth of a poetic mind,

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:26.330
a poetic mind that
develops a new inwardness

00:35:26.330 --> 00:35:29.040
and melancholy possessed
by self doubt.

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:34.240
Don Quixote gives up most of the
aggression and [inaudible] violence

00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:37.080
that mark his attempt to revive
[inaudible] chivalry in part one

00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:41.630
and adopts a new moderation, peace
ability and humanity according

00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:45.240
to David Quint in "Cervantes's
Novel of Modern Times".

00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:48.500
And Sancho who grows in
importance as the novel develops,

00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:52.920
evolves as well, from a peasant
with not much in the way of brains

00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:55.600
to the wise governorship
of [inaudible].

00:35:55.600 --> 00:36:02.260
Cervantes' novel can in fact
be read as Sancho's [talking

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:05.250
in foreign language] Sancho's
formation and education.

00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:08.390
Perhaps it is this
quality of Cervantes' novel

00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:10.000
that [inaudible] Dostoevsky
to conclude that

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.950
"Don Quixote" condenses the deepest
meaning of the human experience.

00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:18.340
Here is the famous passage
from "A Writer's Diary":

00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:21.000
"There is nothing deeper and
more powerful in the whole world

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.320
than this piece of fiction.

00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:25.960
It is the final and greatest
expression of human thought,

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:29.520
the most bitter irony that a
human is capable of expressing.

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:33.750
And if the world came to an and
people were asked somewhere,

00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:36.120
well did you understand
anything from life on earth

00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:37.990
and draw any conclusion from it?

00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:41.560
A person could silently
hand over 'Don Quixote'.

00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:44.770
Here is my conclusion about life".

00:36:44.770 --> 00:36:48.340
Due perhaps to the symbolic
power behind the mythic

00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:50.960
and easily visualized Quixoticism,

00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:53.950 position:56%
Cervantes's invention has inspired
an extraordinary number of readings,

00:36:53.950 --> 00:36:58.560 position:56%
interpretations, adaptations, and
re-fashionings in almost every genre

00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:01.050

and painting

00:37:01.050 --> 00:37:04.080
to opera and animated cartoon.

00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:06.960
Modern philosophy and politics
also cannot be understood

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:08.890
without the mark of "Don Quixote".

00:37:08.890 --> 00:37:12.390
In Anglo-America this influence
can be recognized at the level

00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:16.760
of mentalities in the process of
Don Quixote's self invention based

00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:19.790
on his personal notion of
freedom and responsibility.

00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:24.330
This could be linked to the
archetype of the self made man

00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:29.970
and Don Quixote's famous phrase
in chapter 66 of second half,

00:37:29.970 --> 00:37:31.270
"Every man is the architect

00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:37.080
of his own destiny" encapsulates
this attitude, this stance.

00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:39.640
He says, "Every man is the
architect of his own destiny"

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:43.320

when he accepts full responsibility.

Thomas Jefferson considered "Don
Quixote" the best work in its genre

00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:59.940
and had his daughters study Spanish
with a copy of "Don Quixote".

00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:05.240
In Jefferson's political rhetoric
of freedom and potential equality

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:09.760
and the "all men are created
equal" sentence contained

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:11.740
in the second paragraph of
the United States Declaration

00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:15.940 position:56%
of Independence we can recognize Don
Quixote's personal moral philosophy

1865 famous motto "with malice
towards none, with charity for all",

00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:30.960

Don Quixote's self portrait

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:33.400
in chapter 32 of the
second part of the novel.

00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:37.530
After having listened to
the disparaging condemnation

00:38:37.530 --> 00:38:41.290
of his life's purpose and ideals
by the judgmental house chaplain

00:38:41.290 --> 00:38:44.540
in the duke's palace, Don Quixote
concludes his self defense speech

00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:46.620
with the following words:
[talking in foreign language]

00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:54.080
In Tobias Smollett's
1755 translation,

00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:59.500
"my intention I always
direct to a worthy aim;

00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:04.940
namely to do good unto all
men and harm to no creature".

00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:07.750
Dr. Martin Luther King's
Quixotic 1963

00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:10.070
"I Have a Dream" speech
can be read as modeled

00:39:10.070 --> 00:39:13.080
after the romantic interpretation
of Don Quixote's declared mission

00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:17.890
in his famous golden age speech,
to bring back the golden age utopia

00:39:17.890 --> 00:39:20.580
on Earth, to go forth and change
the world and to build a society

00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:23.390
that is nobler, kinder, and just.

00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:26.800
Chapter 11 of "Don
Quixote", first part.

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:32.110
Recently, American
filmmaker Martin Scorsese

00:39:32.110 --> 00:39:37.790
in his autobiography writes,

00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:41.420
"I read 'Don Quixote' just before
starting 'Gangs of New York'

00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:45.040
and discovered that everything
you might want to do with style,

00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:48.710
Cervantes did first; time
shifts, answering his critics

00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:52.200
of the first volume in the
second, all the new wave tricks.

00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:53.670
It's both terribly
funny and maddening

00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:55.840
because by the end you don't
really know where the point

00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:58.000
of view is coming from,
who Don Quixote is,

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.650
or if he really believed
in what he was doing.

00:40:00.650 --> 00:40:03.330
And the relationship with
Sancho Panza is great,

00:40:03.330 --> 00:40:05.210
but over the years I
was against reading it

00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:07.490
because it had become a cliche.

00:40:07.490 --> 00:40:10.370
The man charging at the
windmills and all that.

00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:15.100
The one film version I did see
was Grigori Kozintsev's made

00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:18.080
in Russia 1957 which
I thought was good,

00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:19.460 position:56%
but I haven't seen [inaudible] film,

00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:22.300
and 'Man of La Mancha'
really isn't for me.

00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:26.940
Anyway, I just found out that
Cervantes did it all even before

00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:29.560
Joyce and Melville.

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:35.140
In conclusion I would like
to pay the brief homage

00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:45.620
to Bob Dylan alongside Cervantes,
the recent Nobel Prize winner."

00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:49.680
Well let us compare the
episode of Don Quixote's dream

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:55.740
within a dream story in Montesinos
Cave in the second part chapter 23

00:40:55.740 --> 00:41:01.400 position:56%
with Bob Dylan's iconic 1965 song
"Desolation Road", the closing track

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:06.800
of Dylan's studio album
"Highway 61 Revisited".

00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:10.130
Dreams have fascinated people for
centuries and are present in some

00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:11.540
of the world's oldest texts.

00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:13.750
For example, Pharaoh's
dream interpreted

00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:16.150
by Joseph in the Old Testament.

00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:20.960
Latin literature has Scipio's dream
complete with a trip to the moon

00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:23.770
and a vision of the
future of the Roman Empire.

00:41:23.770 --> 00:41:25.530
Yet the difference
between these dreams

00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:27.810
and Don Quixote's dreams
is essential.

00:41:27.810 --> 00:41:30.900
Most dreams from ancient literary
text are either revelations

00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:32.360
about the future or premonitions

00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:35.360
of future disasters
or coming successes.

00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:37.000
Not so with Don Quixote's dream.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.920
In it our hero is deeply
troubled by his role in history

00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:44.360
and especially worried
about his relationship

00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:47.130
with Dulcinea, or to Dulcinea.

00:41:47.130 --> 00:41:49.790
Don Quixote wakes up after
falling asleep when he sits

00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:55.240
down in the cave, and so
he awakens within a dream.

00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:58.890
Montesinos, the legendary
figure of Carolingian ballads,

00:41:58.890 --> 00:42:04.040
that is Spanish ballads inspired
by the French epic poem [talking

00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:08.110
in foreign language] greets the
knight of the sad countenance.

00:42:08.110 --> 00:42:12.660
And he says, "it's been a long time
valiant Don Quixote de la Mancha,

00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:15.430
that we who live in these
lonely places have been awaiting

00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:16.860
for your visit.

00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:20.680 position:56%
Come with me illustrious sir, and I
shall show you the marvels concealed

00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:22.620
in this transparent castle.

00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:25.610
Translation, John Rutherford.

00:42:25.610 --> 00:42:30.360
Don Quixote continues his account
to Sancho Panza and his guide

00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:33.410
and to the guide who
led him to the cave.

00:42:34.610 --> 00:42:37.610
Says Don Quixote, "The
venerable Montesinos took me

00:42:37.610 --> 00:42:41.100
into the crystal palace where
there was a marble tomb upon

00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:48.190 position:56%
which I saw a knight who was lying
not one of bronze, marble, or jasper

00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:51.270
but made of real flesh
and real blood".

00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:55.450
Don Quixote-- Montesinos explains
to Don Quixote that it is--

00:42:55.450 --> 00:42:59.630
that this is his friend Durandarte,
the flower and mirror of the brave

00:42:59.630 --> 00:43:02.520
and enamored knights of
his time, kept there,

00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:07.270
enchanted like many other men
and women are also kept here

00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:10.400
by Merlin the French sorcerer.

00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:16.070
Durandarte had breathed his
last breath in Montesinos' arms

00:43:16.070 --> 00:43:18.570
after requesting that his
heart be cut out and taken

00:43:18.570 --> 00:43:25.390
to his beloved Belerma as a
famous ballad sung in his tomb.

00:43:25.390 --> 00:43:29.520
Oh my cousin Montesinos,
listen to my last request.

00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:34.300
When I'm lying dead before you and
my soul's flown from my breast,

00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:40.010
take a poniard or a dagger,
cut my heart from out of me,

00:43:40.010 --> 00:43:44.770
carry it to fair Belerma,
to wherever she may be.

00:43:44.770 --> 00:43:47.540
Although more than 500
years have now passed,

00:43:47.540 --> 00:43:52.060
none of us has really
died says Montesinos.

00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:53.610
Don Quixote then recounts a scene

00:43:53.610 --> 00:43:57.300
where there was a great
weeping and wailing.

00:43:57.300 --> 00:44:01.320
I turned my head and through
the crystal walls I saw

00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:04.130
in another room procession
of two files

00:44:04.130 --> 00:44:07.290
of lonely damsels, all mourning.

00:44:07.290 --> 00:44:10.330
All the people in the processions
were the servants of Belerma

00:44:10.330 --> 00:44:15.970
and Durandarte enchanted together
with their master and mistress.

00:44:15.970 --> 00:44:19.260
Montesinos informs that the pallor
and the rings under the eyes

00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:24.490
of Belerma are not caused by that
problem women have every month

00:44:24.490 --> 00:44:27.130
because it has been
months and even years

00:44:27.130 --> 00:44:30.770
since it last came
knocking on her door.

00:44:30.770 --> 00:44:37.690 position:56%
We inhabit an underworld where the
characters are grotesque distortions

00:44:37.690 --> 00:44:40.030
of their previous heroic selves.

00:44:40.030 --> 00:44:44.220
Leading the strange
absurd life trapped

00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:46.720
in another dimension
of space and time.

00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:49.690
One hour has passed
according to Sancho,

00:44:49.690 --> 00:44:53.300
and three days according
to Don Quixote.

00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:57.260
But as Sancho Panza says, maybe
what seems to us like an hour seems

00:44:57.260 --> 00:45:00.520
like three days down there.

00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:03.170
Cervantes' degraded
vision of the past reveals

00:45:03.170 --> 00:45:07.300
to us how the subconscious mind
of Don Quixote is much less sure

00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:09.690
of his role in the world
and of the moral qualities

00:45:09.690 --> 00:45:11.270
of the woman he loves.

00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:16.050
The mythical times of heroes
and legends has been infiltrated

00:45:16.050 --> 00:45:21.090
and slowly eroded by prosaic
details, aging and decay.

00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:25.170
And nothing similar can be
found in renaissance literature.

00:45:25.170 --> 00:45:29.240
Placing myth in a prosaic setting,
subjecting the idealized creatures

00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:33.470
of legend to real time is a
mode of questioning and dealing

00:45:33.470 --> 00:45:38.790 position:56%
with the past passed down from
Cervantes to Kafka's "Metamorphosis"

00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:41.850
and Joyce's "Ulysses"
and relived by Bob Dylan

00:45:41.850 --> 00:45:45.590
to revolutionize the
American song tradition.

00:45:45.590 --> 00:45:49.570
In "Desolation Row" in its surreal
lyrics, Dylan weaved characters

00:45:49.570 --> 00:45:53.030
from history, fiction, the
Bible, and of his own invention

00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:58.570
into a series of vignettes that
suggest entropy and urban chaos.

00:45:58.570 --> 00:46:03.910
For Andy Gill, the second is
"an 11 minute epic of entropy,

00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:07.730
which takes the form of a
Fellini-esque parade of grotesques

00:46:07.730 --> 00:46:11.210
and oddities featuring a huge
cast of iconic characters,

00:46:11.210 --> 00:46:17.300
some historical, some Biblical,
some literary, and some who fit

00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:22.170
in none of the above categories.

00:46:22.170 --> 00:46:27.720
And some as Romeo,
Cinderella, and Ophelia taken

00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:34.780
from the idealized literature that
purveys Don Quixote's imagination.

In Cervantes' cave of Montesinos, an
uncanny purgatory of broken myths--

00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:47.120
Cervantes' cave of Montesinos
uncanny purgatory of broken myths,

00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:50.750
the heroes of French epic and
Arthurian legends have become,

00:46:50.750 --> 00:46:54.160
alongside Don Quixote's beloved
Dulcinea, enchanted figures

00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:58.920
of desolation, eroded by centuries
of prose, quiet in their tombs,

00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:03.170
or passing by in a whaling
procession of unending sorrow.

00:47:03.170 --> 00:47:08.080
In Dylan's "Desolation Row", Cane
and Abel, Robin Hood, Casanova,

00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:13.000
the Hunchback of Notre Dame, the
Phantom of the Opera, Cinderella,

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:17.780
Romeo and Ophelia unite with
Belerma and Durandarte, Montesinos

00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:22.630 position:56%
and Dulcinea, lost souls in a poetic
limbo awaiting for [inaudible]

00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:24.740
for the messiah knight or
the American [inaudible]

00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:27.920
who would redeem them from
the horrors of history,

00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:30.230
from the horrors of time.

00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:33.510
Now, sit [inaudible].

00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:44.070
[ Applause ]

00:47:44.070 --> 00:47:47.380
&gt;&gt; Talia Guzman-Gonzales: Would
you take some questions from them?

00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:49.610
&gt;&gt; Hernan Pinillos: Yeah, sure.

00:47:49.610 --> 00:47:53.060
&gt;&gt; I have a question.

00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:59.530
It's not every day that we get to
meet an expert on "Don Quixote"

00:47:59.530 --> 00:48:02.900
and I just have a particular
question.

00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:05.940
In 2002 I believe it was
"Guardian" was it that named,

00:48:05.940 --> 00:48:11.990
that requested the best
hundred writers of the time

00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:15.730
to select the best 100 books
in the history of humankind

00:48:15.730 --> 00:48:17.770
and of course [inaudible]
"The Gilgamesh", "The Old Man

00:48:17.770 --> 00:48:22.980
and the Sea", "The Iliad"
[inaudible] but when they got

00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:26.040
to Don Quixote they couldn't
even categorize it as number one

00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:28.850
and they named it the
best book ever written.

00:48:28.850 --> 00:48:36.060 position:56%
And then we see Don Quixote in every
day aspects; book marks, in statues,

00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:38.240
in billboards, and everywhere.

00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:45.350
Yet I was astonished that on April
23rd when we celebrate the death

00:48:45.350 --> 00:48:52.560
of Cervantes, and Shakespeare,
Google Doodle did not pay tribute

00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:55.180
to "Don Quixote" [laughter]
and Cervantes

00:48:55.180 --> 00:48:59.070
and then it was a bombardment
of Shakespeare all the time.

00:48:59.070 --> 00:49:00.370
I mean what's your take on that?

00:49:00.370 --> 00:49:03.510
What's the, your take on
the fact that we have,

00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:05.600
according to [inaudible],
according Carlos Fuentes,

00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:09.530
according to [inaudible]
the best book ever written

00:49:09.530 --> 00:49:13.360
that doesn't get the attention
that Shakespeare gets these days?

00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:15.590
&gt;&gt; Hernan Pinillos: Thank you.

00:49:15.590 --> 00:49:20.060
I don't know, I guess the
reasons to be political.

00:49:20.060 --> 00:49:23.240
On literary grounds it's
difficult to defend.

00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:26.820
There are Shakespearean
critics who caught

00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:31.390
up in the what has been termed
bardolatry make pejorative

00:49:31.390 --> 00:49:33.140
comparisons with Cervantes.

00:49:33.140 --> 00:49:37.020
No it's quite common to say well,
in this regard Cervantes is better,

00:49:37.020 --> 00:49:38.800
but only in this regard no?

00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:44.750
You have [inaudible] who
termed "Don Quixote" a squire,

00:49:44.750 --> 00:49:46.930 position:56%
or could be a squire of "King Lear".

00:49:46.930 --> 00:49:48.230
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:50.590
&gt;&gt; Hernan Pinillos: Harold
Bloom talks about the invention

00:49:50.590 --> 00:49:54.770
of the human based on Shakespeare
but there are many things

00:49:54.770 --> 00:49:59.200
that Cervantes passed
on to literary tradition

00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:00.500 position:56%
that are not present in Shakespeare.

00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:04.820
First of all, he invented
the prevalent form

00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:07.810
of modern consciousness
which is the novel.

00:50:07.810 --> 00:50:14.120
And Shakespeare's dealing with
the tragedy in the mode of cineca,

00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:21.170
and Shakespeare read "Don Quixote"
part one no, [inaudible] lost play.

00:50:21.170 --> 00:50:22.710
And he read a lot of
Spanish literature.

00:50:22.710 --> 00:50:24.060
He read "La Philistina"
[assumed spelling].

00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:27.240
He read sentimental romance
novels, pastoral novels

00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:29.940
that influenced his writing a
lot, but Spain was the enemy

00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:34.120
so it wasn't a matter
of quoting too much.

00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:39.330
The ending of Hamlet you know with
those deaths, successive deaths,

00:50:39.330 --> 00:50:41.520
accumulation of deaths,
that's present

00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:47.990
in the Spanish sentimental
romance novel.

00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:54.150 position:56%
But yeah we don't have this crossing
of social lines in Shakespeare.

00:50:54.150 --> 00:50:57.770
We don't have the strong feminine
characters, Dorotea, Marcela.

00:50:57.770 --> 00:51:03.410
Now compare them with
Ophelia, Desdemona, you know?

00:51:03.410 --> 00:51:08.620
You know all the women
who-- Cordelia--

00:51:08.620 --> 00:51:12.980
you know, who let themselves
die for a man.

00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:14.830
Women who were played
by male actors.

00:51:14.830 --> 00:51:19.570
In Spain you had female
actors interpreting strong

00:51:19.570 --> 00:51:22.210
women characters.

00:51:22.210 --> 00:51:27.340
Another aspect which I didn't
develop, or I didn't touch is,

00:51:27.340 --> 00:51:30.080 position:56%
that is present in Cervantes' humor,

00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:32.790
humor in all its levels
and functions.

00:51:32.790 --> 00:51:37.090
You have slapstick comedy, but
you have the folly as a basis

00:51:37.090 --> 00:51:40.590
to British humor, you
know, laughing at oneself.

00:51:40.590 --> 00:51:48.210
In Cervantes' own creation of
his fig- [inaudible] figure

00:51:48.210 --> 00:51:51.000
in the prologues, you
have [inaudible]

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.970 position:56%
that doesn't take himself seriously.

00:51:53.970 --> 00:51:59.300
And then you have also the first
time, according to one critic,

00:51:59.300 --> 00:52:03.000
where the unmotivated action,
the rupture between cause

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:07.470
and effect is presented in
chapter 25 of the first part.

00:52:07.470 --> 00:52:12.930
In Don Quixote's penance he's
going to do wild and crazy things

00:52:12.930 --> 00:52:19.330
in imitation of Orlando who went
mad because of the infidelities

00:52:19.330 --> 00:52:22.450
of Angelica with [inaudible].

00:52:22.450 --> 00:52:24.650
But Sancho tells him
that you have no reason

00:52:24.650 --> 00:52:26.540
and there's also Cardenio
who's going crazy

00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:31.560
because Lucinda he
thinks has betrayed him.

00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:38.690
And Don Quixote says
it's not a problem, no?

00:52:38.690 --> 00:52:45.260
[Talking in foreign language]
I do this without a cause,

00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:48.600
so he's just starts going
mad without a cause, no?

00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:52.350
That's the first representation
of the absurd you have.

00:52:52.350 --> 00:52:55.360
Think of Ionesco [assumed
spelling], Beckett,

00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:59.730
or the great Spanish Theater of
the Absurd, unjustly forgotten,

00:52:59.730 --> 00:53:01.540
Javier Consela Miramura
[assumed spelling].

00:53:01.540 --> 00:53:04.800
Also Monty Python,
the Marx Brothers.

00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:10.510 position:56%
You have the essence, the core, the
germ of that humor in "Don Quixote".

00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:15.240
&gt;&gt; First of all, thank
you very much.

00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:18.480
That was very enlightening.

00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:19.780
&gt;&gt; Hernan Pinillos: Thank you.

00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:25.350
&gt;&gt; No philosophy has had more of
an impact on modern literature

00:53:25.350 --> 00:53:32.600
and existentialism
[inaudible] mentioned Quixote

00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:35.220
in that context [inaudible] Ortega.

00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:37.020
Ortega said that man has no--

00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:54.610
[ Inaudible ]

00:53:54.610 --> 00:53:57.020
You've got Kafka, you've
got Dostoevsky,

00:53:57.020 --> 00:54:01.960
all these writers heavily imbued
with existentialists [inaudible].

00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:07.730
So we could call "Don
Quixote" rather

00:54:07.730 --> 00:54:10.880
than [inaudible] the
first existentialist hero?

00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:12.650
&gt;&gt; Hernan Pinillos:
Well, the thing is,

00:54:12.650 --> 00:54:18.640
existentialism is a 20th
century movement, right?

00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:20.510
With [inaudible].

00:54:20.510 --> 00:54:25.270
So there are, I mean as a
historical determination,

00:54:25.270 --> 00:54:29.470 position:56%
we can do existentialist readings or
we could find existentialist motives

00:54:29.470 --> 00:54:34.690
in "Hamlet" and in "Don Quixote"
but I think yeah that it,

00:54:34.690 --> 00:54:38.800
in their core you can find
[inaudible] we see the construction

00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:43.250
of the character Don Quixote
breaking away from the essence

00:54:43.250 --> 00:54:47.700
of being an hidalgo, or
being a 50 year old bachelor,

00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:49.180
and he just reinvents himself.

00:54:49.180 --> 00:54:53.190
So that, yeah that strikes to
the, your quote, the separation

00:54:53.190 --> 00:54:57.320
between history and nature.

00:54:57.320 --> 00:55:01.950
And Ortega and Unamuno constructed
their philosophical systems

00:55:01.950 --> 00:55:04.200
as commentaries on "Don Quixote".

00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:06.560
In 1905, "Vida de Don
Quijote y Sancho",

00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:07.860
life of Don Quixote and Sancho.

00:55:07.860 --> 00:55:10.450
In 1914, "Meditations
on Don Quixote".

00:55:10.450 --> 00:55:14.240
On just reflecting on "Don Quixote"
they came up with their system.

00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:16.910 position:56%
So you could say at least that they,

00:55:16.910 --> 00:55:24.730
they're at the basis
of this thought school.

00:55:27.270 --> 00:55:31.550
Thank you.

00:55:31.550 --> 00:55:32.850
Yeah.

00:55:32.850 --> 00:55:34.910
&gt;&gt; I was, I'm curious.

00:55:34.910 --> 00:55:39.710
It doesn't have much to
do with your presentation

00:55:39.710 --> 00:55:47.640
but I was just curious right now
since you brought up the question

00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:51.050
of Shakespeare if you have read
the [talking in foreign language]

00:55:51.050 --> 00:55:56.920
and what do you think about
this question of what is--

00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:59.770
&gt;&gt; Hernan Pinillos:
I haven't read it.

00:55:59.770 --> 00:56:02.020
&gt;&gt; Okay, forget it.

00:56:02.020 --> 00:56:03.890
&gt;&gt; Hernan Pinillos: But
do you want to comment?

00:56:03.890 --> 00:56:08.370
&gt;&gt; No, [inaudible] I wanted
to know what was your opinion

00:56:08.370 --> 00:56:10.170
about [inaudible] the first novel
ever written or [inaudible].

00:56:10.170 --> 00:56:11.470
&gt;&gt; Hernan Pinillos: Well the term

00:56:11.470 --> 00:56:13.650
of novel you have the
idealized novels of--

00:56:13.650 --> 00:56:19.240 position:56%
I mean of Greek literature, the
Byzantine novels derived from Homer,

00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:24.880
and then you have in Rome two
great novels in "Satyricon"

00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:26.180
and "The Golden Ass"
[talking in foreign language]

00:56:26.180 --> 00:56:28.850
so this is defining
the modern novel.

00:56:28.850 --> 00:56:31.140
But also some critics
say the picaresque novel

00:56:31.140 --> 00:56:32.730
"Lazarillo de Tormes"
is the first novel.

00:56:32.730 --> 00:56:38.560
Some will say "La Philistina"
[assumed spelling] biological work,

00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:40.920
play, that can be read
as a [inaudible] novel,

00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:44.010
so there's a big theoretical
discussion but in terms

00:56:44.010 --> 00:56:48.710
of modern literature with
this new heroic stance

00:56:48.710 --> 00:56:51.710
with his proto-existentialist
elements,

00:56:51.710 --> 00:56:55.550
characters that grow, that change.

00:56:55.550 --> 00:57:01.770
Because Ancient Greek novels
were based on very fixed,

00:57:01.770 --> 00:57:04.630
defined characteristics, no?

00:57:04.630 --> 00:57:11.110
[Inaudible] the revelations, the
encounters, voyages, perfect loves.

00:57:11.110 --> 00:57:12.900
But it's a different mode.

00:57:12.900 --> 00:57:19.390
So this would be the mode
of the modern novel, okay?

00:57:19.390 --> 00:57:20.690
Thanks.
