00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's go back and take a look at this again.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We now know how deep. It's log n.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
And we know how many leaves. It's n.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
At each of these levels, not only is it going to compute the subgraph of the given size,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
but then it's going to add 1 more edge that is the connector between the 2 components.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
So there's 1 of those edges gets added at this level.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
There's 2 that get added at this level.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
There's 4 that get added at this level.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
There's 8 that get added at this level.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Until finally, at the end of the day, there's zero that get added at this level.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
But the level right above it, there's n.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So the total number of edges that get added is the sum of all these things--

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
n + n/2 + n/4 to 1.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
That is basically 2n--so that we don't have to say basically

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
we can say it's exactly Î˜(n),

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
meaning it's basically 2n.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
What we basically rediscovered is that the number of edges in a tree,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
or one of these randomly generated trees,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
is still linear.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
That's not so surprising, but this particular way of doing the analysis with this tree

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
is going to turn out to be useful in some other settings.
