00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.820
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:04.670
- Good afternoon.

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.390
Thank you Sophia for
this wonderful generous

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:08.300
introduction.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.770
And thanks to all of you for
coming on this beautiful day.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:15.200
And I don't think that anything
can beat spring colors.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.780
Especially not fluorescence.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.600
Microscopy will come to
that at the end of my talk.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.760
And so far I just
start at the beginning.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.830
In the 18th century,
nothing much

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.160
happened from the point of
view of the microscopist.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.380
This was for you Bob.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.430
The 17th century had seen the
invention of the microscope,

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.640
and for the first
time given access

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.270
to a miraculous world
previously unimaginable.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.940
The 19th century lay
still ahead in the future.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.900
And with the advancement
of microscopic technology,

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.750
it would bring the pathbreaking
discovery, for example,

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.000
of cells and pathogens.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.300
Sandwiched-- so to speak--
between miracle and discovery,

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.730
18th century microscopy was
left with meer curiosity.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.210
Curiosity we argue is
an interesting thing.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.490
So I want to make
you start thinking

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.850
about biological emotion,
because it's my suspicion--

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.320
forgive me-- that you have
rarely done so with discussing

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.210
a case from the 18th century.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.100
As you will see, the
case suits both meanings

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.950
of the word curiosity,
referring on the one hand

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.250
to our desire to know
and to learn something,

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.300
and on the other hand to a
strange and unusual object

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.250
or fact in itself.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.830
So in the second half
of the 18th century,

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.700
a number of
microscopy books were

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.000
published in the German town
of Nuremburg-- which was then

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.220
at that time,
together with London,

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.520
the European Center for
scientific engraving

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.750
illustrated books, and
illumination of copper plates

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.040
and engravings.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.010
And among those books
of Martin Frobenius

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.640
Ledermuller's
Microscopic Amusements.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.620
And here.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.340
This is the cover of the book.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.980
The amusements are
accompanied by 100

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.120
delicate hand-colored engravings
of microscopic objects.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.460
And in those plates,
nature is presented

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.540
in beautiful symmetry,
order, and ornamental design.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.660
And you can see some of
the macroscopic objects

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:32.140
under investigation
that were in the book.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.500
The amusements--
the microscope which

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.810
was used to make
these representations,

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.180
however, was not an
ordinary microscope,

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.040
but a solar microscope.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.200
And a solar microscope
is an instrument

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.720
that is at the same time
a magnifying, as well

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.610
as, projecting device.

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.190
With the help of the
sunlight, the image

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.520
of the macroscopic
object is either

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.750
a transparent or
a liquid one, is

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.080
projected onto the wall
of a darkened room.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.230
And here you can see one
of those instrument that

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.190
is at the Collection of
Historical Instruments.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.110
And lucky enough
when I came here

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.880
at the beginning of
the academic year,

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.100
there was the exhibition
at the Harvard Art

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.350
Museum of the
Philosophy Chamber,

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.650
where they had two
of those projections.

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.990
The effect that you
can see here easily,

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.750
is that the minutest and
most delicate objects

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.500
are magnified to room size,
and thereby directly enter

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.580
the space of the spectator,
whereas, as you know maybe

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.910
from biology lessons,
in classical microscopy,

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.820
it is the instrument that is
between the microscopic world

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.310
of the observer, and
the microscopic one

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.620
under the tiny cover slip.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.870
So solar microscopes
were widespread

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.010
in the Enlightenment.

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.820
They were part of what was
then seen as an artful science,

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:54.130
as part of the educated pastime
of the gentleman scientist.

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.000
And it was part of the
social activity of amateurs.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.960
And demonstrations
with a solar microscope

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.570
were public demonstrations of
scientific, and in this case,

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:05.920
microscopic knowledge.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.090
They were performances.

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.840
And I am interested in
a particular question.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.720
What exactly was being
performed with the help

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.430
of those instruments?

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.410
We already know that one thing
was size, according to this.

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.190
And here we see the skin of
a finger, with all its lines,

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.920
pores, cracks,
and fine fissures.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.560
Under the solar
microscope, however, we

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.420
see something else as well.

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.910
We can see you
projected onto the wall

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.850
the evaporation of the
hands like, I quote,

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.270
"a dense smoke rising
from the fingers."

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.960
So the copper plates-- that we
have preserved in this book--

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.630
meticulously capture the
structure of the skin.

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:52.150
But it's liveliness, it's
breathing, escapes them.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.390
You might consider this
lack of vividness excusable.

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:58.300
After all it's a finger,
and you usually I guess

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.630
don't think of your fingers
as respiratory organs

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.370
in the first place.

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.510
But insects may
change your view.

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.380
Here you can see that's
an iconic depiction

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.230
of Robert Hooke's flea
from his micrography

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:15.460
in the 17th century.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.980
And that might be the
most widespread image

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.760
of a microscopic object in
the 17th and 18th century.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.180
And you'll easily see that this
depiction from Ledermuller's

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:30.410
book 100 years later is almost
identical in its structure.

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:34.090
So seeing an insect enlarged
too extravagant size

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.280
is indeed only one thing.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.520
Seeing it move, however,
is quite another.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.520
In his story Master
Flea E.T.A. Hoffman--

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.090
the novelist-- beautifully
captures the sensation

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:50.770
of insects moving in life-size
in a darkened room with

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.700
a spectator in the
midst of it I quote--

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.660
and I have the German
quote for those

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:59.030
that want to read the German,
because it's very vivid--

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.840
"The door of the hall
flew open violently,

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.080
and in frantic throng the
people plunged toward him, death

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.420
pale horror on their faces.

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.510
A glance into the hall revealed
at once two young peoples

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.730
the reason for this
frightful horror.

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:14.900
Inside everything was alive.

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.170
A revolting confusion of
the most loathsome creatures

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:20.170
filled the entire room.

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:22.960
The race of plant
lies, beetles, spiders,

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:27.780
slime worms magnified
to excessive size, where

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.010
extending their
proboscises, walking

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:33.730
about on tall, hairy
legs, and hideous antlions

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:36.870
were seizing and squashing
with their jagged claws,

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.130
that connects with
their long wings.

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.580
Never had [INAUDIBLE] held
anything more-- beheld anything

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:45.310
more revolting."

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:48.580
So in Hoffman's story,
magnification and movement

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:51.190
combined are a source of horror.

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:53.350
What the solar
microscope unveiled

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:55.870
was not the world
we have seen before,

00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:00.220
a word of order and ornament,
but of utter disorder

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:02.580
of insects battling
fiercely, moving

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:06.370
erratically, a monstrous
mixture of the unknown.

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:10.570
Microscopic movement gave
reason for literary fiction.

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:14.470
Making sense of it in real
life was an equally imaginative

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:16.420
task.

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:19.870
And here you see the copper
plate of a single insect--

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:25.400
a water beetle-- or [INAUDIBLE]
as it is named in the book.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:30.040
And this is actually a very
typical representation.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.500
In the lower parts you
see anatomical details,

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.690
and in the upper part
the whole animal.

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:37.690
They are all magnified
and depicted.

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:43.570
But what you also see is in the
upper part of the copper plate,

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:46.030
you see a sequence
of what appears

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:49.840
to be a little thin, red
ribbon moving and twisting.

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.750
And this is the insect
in its original size.

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:54.990
And the undulations,
and little stars

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:59.290
that you might be able to see
are indicating it's movement.

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:02.090
The depiction of this
depiction of movement,

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:05.350
however, is only a
very weak reflection

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:08.230
of what the tiny
animal is capable of.

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:10.410
And of what actually Mueller--

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:12.310
later Mueller--
pardon-- observed.

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:15.040
And here I quote
again, "I will never

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.710
know for sure whether
there are comedies played

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:19.960
in the realm of
water beetles, even

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.080
though I saw incidence
and heroic deeds, which

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:27.190
would provide a basis for the
most beautiful place on stage.

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:29.170
The other day I
observed with pleasure

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:33.220
a brave polyp on the battlefield
victorious over many hundreds

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:34.750
enemies.

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:37.919
Also it is for sure that
amongst these creatures,

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:40.000
there is one
resembling the stage

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.970
character of the Harlequin.

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:45.850
His black head, his checkered
body, his ridiculous jumps,

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:49.330
skipping contortions, have
much in common with this funny

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:53.830
character of the Italian
Commedia dell'arte.

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:56.920
Understanding
microscopic animals move

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:59.560
and the theatrical
staging of the performance

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:03.610
of the solar microscope
went hand in hand.

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:06.340
And here you can see on
these two plates, how

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:09.730
we have to imagine the
staging, the curtains,

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:12.180
and the seating
of the spectators,

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:16.250
and the 18th century decor
of such a performance.

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:19.840
The theater offered a
framework to approach and make

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:23.950
sense of what otherwise in
the words of the art historian

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:28.040
James Elkins, only cost
visual desperation.

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:31.960
It provided the metaphors
to understand observation

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:35.650
by way of analogy, and
to classify phenomena

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:37.610
in terms of known categories.

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:45.580
So animate motion was indeed a
curiosity in the 18th century.

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:48.280
The solar microscope
brought it to the fore

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:51.910
as a strange and unusual object.

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:55.420
I will argue that it has
never quite ceased to be one.

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:59.500
On the contrary, animate
motion became more elusive

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:01.320
while had the technology
to investigate

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.620
it became more invasive.

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:07.660
And the scientific concept
of motion more powerful.

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:12.070
I have discussed this early
case from the 18th century

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:14.890
to give you a concrete idea
of the complexity which

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:19.180
the study of biological motion
had right from the onset.

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:22.240
The questions which
the 18th century asked,

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:26.460
the strategies it applied, and
the problems it encountered

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:29.930
are still and persist
up to the present day.

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:32.830
So firstly, the study
of biological motion

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:34.390
involved an instrument.

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:38.260
The microscope is the portal to
a world that is otherwise not

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.200
accessible.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:45.070
Secondly, there is the
question of the representation

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:46.750
of movement.

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:49.540
With a solar microscope,
we notice a shift

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:52.780
from the static
representation of nature

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:55.250
to the performance
of the living world.

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:57.310
And as you have seen,
the animate quality

00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:59.560
of the organic
world is virtually

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:04.390
absent in the illuminated
copperplates and engravings,

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:07.670
or at least it is robbed
of its powerful effect

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:09.790
on the observer.

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:13.070
Projected onto the war, the
microscopic world, by contrast,

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:14.500
has a frightening dynamic.

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:17.440
It is unpredictable and chaotic.

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.710
Along with this shift from
stasis to movement comes

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:24.190
the one-- and that is
important as for someone who is

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:25.960
historically interested--

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:29.620
from the well-preserved
archives of engravings, copper,

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:32.500
and imprinted books to
the fleeting instance

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:36.850
of the performance of which we
know much less today and only

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:39.670
actually know very little
about how these performances,

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:41.680
for example, looked like.

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:44.440
And finally, we observe
a shift in scale

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:47.770
with dramatic consequences
for our perception coming

00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:50.290
with the choice
of representation.

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:53.020
In the darkened room, the
micro and the macro world

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:54.240
meet at eye level.

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.180
That is important.

00:11:55.180 --> 00:12:00.100
The microscopic literally enters
the space of the spectator.

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:03.670
Thirdly and importantly,
the solar microscope

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:06.640
not only brought to
light a world in motion

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:09.790
but also a world
which could easily

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:12.760
be a mere illusion
and deception,

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:17.230
perhaps even as has been
argued, visual quackery.

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:20.890
After all, what did the
naturalists observe?

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:25.270
Their lenses unveiled an
untamed vividness and activity

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:27.370
in a simple drop of water.

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:31.540
But the phenomenon they saw,
other than flies and fleas,

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:36.760
were mostly not yet classifiable
in the 17th and 18th centuries.

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:39.880
The disarray of words
given to these phenomena--

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:44.140
and you have heard some of them
I think-- animalcule, dierken,

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:48.010
protozoa, infusoria,
uhrtischen--

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:50.440
they point to
fundamental questions.

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:54.160
Where these moving objects,
plants, or were these animals?

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.050
Were they dead or alive?

00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:59.740
And if so, if they
were alive, were they

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:02.050
alive because they were moving?

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:04.840
Furthermore, how to describe
their many-fold ways

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:05.830
of moving--

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:08.740
as chaotic or directed?

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:11.530
Nuanced intention
and even like those

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:12.970
of the characters in the play?

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:20.700
Biologic motion is a phenomenon
as ubiquitous as it is elusive.

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:24.300
The combination of terms
even seems tautological.

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:26.460
Our understanding
of anything alive

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:30.320
is moving dates back
as far as Aristotle.

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.040
And at the end of my
talk, I'll get back

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:36.090
to how powerful actually this
equation of anything moving

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:39.500
as being alive is until today.

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:41.580
Furthermore, our
senses are geared

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:43.800
towards perceiving motion.

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:47.820
Our human ability to identify
movement is immediate.

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:52.230
It is direct, and it's
actually almost infallible.

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:55.740
There's wonderful psychological
research how easily

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:59.550
we are able to detect movement.

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:03.270
By contrast, any attempt to
evoke the impression of motion

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:06.720
outside direct observation
is dependent on some form

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:09.120
of media or representation.

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:11.760
Movement, in other
words, has to be created.

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:15.870
It has to be brought forth in a
particular experimental setup.

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:18.540
It has to be preserved,
captured, traced.

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:21.810
It involves some
sort of reanimation.

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:25.380
The conceptualization and
representation of motion

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:28.680
are inextricably intertwined
to such an extent--

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:32.940
and you might want
to bear this in mind

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:34.690
during the rest of the talk--

00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:36.600
that we have to
ask actually where

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:40.920
the representation of life ends
and the reality of life begins.

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:46.430
So there is a big but to it.

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:51.210
If the obvious gap between
observing the world as it moves

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:53.960
but portraying it
as still life is

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.660
at the heart of the
scientific investigation

00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:59.390
into movement in the
biological world,

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:04.070
you will ask whether the problem
vanishes quite conveniently

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:07.760
once scientists have new
media at hand, media which

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:11.360
enable to visualize
and preserve movement

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:14.090
as they actually observe it.

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:17.050
And I'm talking,
of course of film.

00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:19.760
In film, the movement we
observe in the organism

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:22.220
is sort of delegated
to the machine.

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:24.860
And in following how
the pictures move,

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:27.380
we have the impression
of seeing the object move

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:29.570
and therefore being alive.

00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:33.680
And it would seem that the
biological sciences concerned

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.870
with living processes
taking place

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:40.550
in time and the cinematographic
technique are a perfect match.

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:43.430
And this has indeed
been widely done.

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:46.490
But instead of solving the
puzzle of animate motion,

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:49.670
I would talk in the
following about how film made

00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:52.460
it even much more complicated.

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:54.560
And I am afraid
you will experience

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:58.160
that to yourselves because the
amount of biological detail

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:02.890
and scientific minutiae that you
will have to absorb from now on

00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:04.700
will just be increasing.

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:09.045
But the Swiss naturalist--

00:16:09.045 --> 00:16:12.680
Julius Ries-- you
might have heard of him

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:16.640
because he is credited to have
been the very first to have

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:21.860
made a scientific film often
developing sea urchins in 1999

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:25.640
and if only his may be the
first film that survived.

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:30.130
And to be precise, this is not
the film, the actual material

00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:33.230
film that survived, but
images of these film

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:38.600
strips that accompany
his publication.

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:41.760
I will not go into the
details of these films,

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:45.080
and these films strips,
which has been done.

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.450
Suffice it to say and
that is easy to see

00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:50.060
that the succession
of images conveys

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:53.600
the impression of the
continuous division of cells

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:58.110
from one into to two,
four, eight, 16, and so on.

00:16:58.110 --> 00:17:00.100
And in the case
of cell division,

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:03.440
Ries did not use
film to understand

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.030
the process of division.

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:08.810
Quite the contrary, he used
film to make maximum effect

00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:10.950
from the camera.

00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:13.280
He was an accomplished
histologist, well

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:16.670
trained in the use
of dyes and slicing

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:20.510
specimen and fabricating all
the tools he needed to do so--

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:24.589
incubators, micro needles,
nutrients, solutions, lamps,

00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:26.550
the whole arsenal of things.

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:30.110
He had excessively started
sea urchin specimens long

00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:35.900
before filming them, and he
exactly knew how they divided.

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:39.470
And you can see on this
plate how we've investigates

00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:43.910
specimens, using dyes and make
these hand colored drawings

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:46.700
that he photographed
then to show the cell

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:49.010
division in this plate.

00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:53.570
And this plate dates from one
year prior to his filming,

00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:57.110
and it was published in a
remarkable little volume called

00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:59.690
Contributions to
the Histophysiology

00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:01.790
of Fertilization.

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:05.000
And the main subject of this
book, as the title indicates,

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.390
is not cell division,
but fertilization.

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:12.230
And here, in this case, Ries had
a very particular hypothesis,

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:15.080
and this one he wanted to prove.

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:18.020
He argued that, A,
the sperm does not

00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:20.510
lose its tail once
it has penetrated

00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:24.530
the membrane of the ovum,
which was the prevailing idea.

00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:26.390
And I doubt that
this question appears

00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:31.490
to be of pressing importance to
you, but it was in that time.

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:35.270
And B, even more
interesting, he held the idea

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:37.940
that it is the
tail's movement which

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:40.730
caused the changes
inside the egg that

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:43.740
occur right after
fertilization, which

00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:48.930
are radial organization
of the substance.

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:53.360
So what he did is he applied the
same strategy for fertilization

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:55.900
as he did for the cell division.

00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:59.840
He made maximum effect
from the camera.

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:02.210
In this case,
however, he used film

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:06.140
to create the scientific
evidence he did not have.

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:08.060
What did you do?

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:12.140
To test his hypothesis of
the rotating sperm tails,

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:14.780
Ries had to devise
an experiment first.

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:18.800
And as a skilled histologist,
he chooses a particular dye,

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:22.340
one that stains the membrane
and the periphery of the ovum,

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:25.700
because this is the area where
actually the sperm and the ovum

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:28.700
get into contact
with one another.

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:32.390
And here you can see
one of the photographs

00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:37.430
he's made which show the
membrane and the sperm's

00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:41.780
attaching to the membrane,
trying to cross and pierce it.

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:43.690
So this is a
photograph of a fixed

00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:47.030
specimen, that is
histological preparation

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:50.100
of organic material.

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:54.150
How the sperm tails actually
rotate inside the ovum,

00:19:54.150 --> 00:20:00.150
however, Ries neither had the
means nor the media to capture.

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:03.060
He could not observe
or experiment upon it.

00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:06.330
He had no dyes to
make it visible.

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:08.340
And he had no
drawings, photographs,

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:11.190
or film to take hold of it.

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:13.740
Encouraged by
these obstacles, he

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:16.620
sought refuge in
yet another medium,

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:20.730
in modeling clay and paints
to make a physical model

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:24.120
of the ovum and the sperm.

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:29.940
So what you see here in
these very delicate, tiny,

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:35.010
white schematic drawings
is, in the succession

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:39.120
from left to right,
how the sperm moves

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:42.180
simultaneously rotating
and moving forward

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:44.040
towards the center of the egg.

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:48.900
And these are the schematic
drawings he made of this model.

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:52.320
This movement, he claims,
causes the radial organization,

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:58.640
which you can see in the
little image up there.

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:02.760
In his book, Ries
characterizes drawings, films,

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:07.410
and photographs he uses
as visual demonstrations

00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:09.330
or sensual demonstrations.

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:12.390
The German word is [GERMAN],,
which is not exclusively

00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:16.140
for images but has this
appeal to the senses--

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:19.920
in opposition to models,
schematic drawings,

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:23.070
which are explanations to him.

00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:26.160
His scientific ingenuity,
however, comes into play

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.780
with his next idea.

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:29.670
He takes the best
of the two worlds

00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:32.010
and fuses them
together into what he

00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:34.980
names as sensual explanation.

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:40.810
How does a sensual explanation
of fertilization look like?

00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:42.780
And I don't know how
well you can see it,

00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:47.970
but it looks like a hand
drawn filmstrip or filmstrips

00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:50.610
of the drawings
made of his model.

00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:56.130
So what he does is he blends
film, drawings, and modeling.

00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:59.310
The hypothesis he
could not actually

00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:02.970
explain because he could
not make it visible

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:06.630
was given the scientific
evidence which only film--

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:09.270
and that is the supposedly
neutral observer

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:10.980
which is the camera lens--

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:12.630
could supply.

00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:16.830
And this creation of evidence
for film is no coincidence.

00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:21.780
As we have seen, he used the
sequential drawings-- pardon--

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:26.250
to represent his clay
models in his photographs.

00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:29.670
But he chose the
filmstrip as a frame

00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:32.370
for this particular
drawing precisely

00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:35.940
because this pictorial
invention enabled him

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:39.900
to visually overcome all
the practical, empirical

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:43.110
experimental limitations
he had encountered

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:45.690
while doing his research.

00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:48.900
And of those limits
there were many.

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:52.450
For example,
magnification was not high

00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:55.050
enough due to the
lack of lenses.

00:22:55.050 --> 00:22:57.270
Lighting was
insufficient for making

00:22:57.270 --> 00:23:01.230
films or dyes were simply
killing the organism instead

00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:03.000
of keeping it alive.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.630
Or this staining just worked
in wrong parts of the organism

00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:10.300
so that he couldn't
see anything.

00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:12.240
And I showed you
in some detail how

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:16.730
Ries worked because I think
it beautifully illustrates

00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:20.640
a historiographical approach to
the study of knowledge, which

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:23.730
stresses exactly the material
and the technological

00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:26.760
conditions under which
scientific objects are

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:29.970
historically made
and come into being.

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:33.110
And the French philosopher
Gaston Bachelard condemns

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:36.180
this view of such a
historical epistemology

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:41.520
already in 1934 in a
single phrase, which I find

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:44.510
is a very beautiful piece
of scientific prose.

00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:48.240
And I will quote, he says,
tell me how to find you

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:51.210
and I will tell
you what you want.

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:55.800
So in other words, visualization
techniques, media, and devices

00:23:55.800 --> 00:24:00.000
are tightly correlated in
theorizing and experimental

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.600
tinkering and the choice of
tools to investigate motion

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:06.270
inside the body and
of course to convince

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:10.115
the spectator, too, of the truth
of the scientific findings.

00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:19.550
Film, historians of science and
media have convincingly argued,

00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:22.840
had many advantages in
investigating the living

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:26.350
organism motion and
processes in general.

00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:29.080
Film captures an
event in its entirety

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:32.440
and in any detail, if
necessary, over long hours.

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:33.790
It never tires.

00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:38.600
It is an impartial observer,
and it can make events visible,

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:41.560
which are either too
slow or too fast to be

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:44.080
perceived by the unaided eye.

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:46.810
And in addition, any kind
of biological processes

00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:48.070
can be manipulated.

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:49.900
A film can be speeded up.

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:51.160
It can be condensed.

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:53.770
It can be looked at
backward, forward.

00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:55.720
It can be stopped.

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:58.360
And you will agree
about this if you

00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:03.040
have a look how the body
was primarily investigated

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:05.810
in the 19th and 20th century.

00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:08.680
What you see here in
this case and in this,

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:12.520
which I have found in a
completely forgotten cupboard

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:17.470
in Berlin in the [INAUDIBLE]
are microscopic slides from

00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:18.420
the 196--

00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:20.290
this is from 1916--

00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:23.530
which gives you a material
impression, actually,

00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:27.190
how the organism under
investigation looked like.

00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:31.630
It presented itself as a
micrometer thin dyed and dead

00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:35.470
extract of organic substance.

00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:38.020
Coming to my next
point, I want to argue

00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:41.680
that bringing the organism
back to life through film

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:46.060
is not only a problem of
including the dimension of time

00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:50.230
by following a process
over time or in time.

00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:53.800
We have seen that Ries was
actually very well capable

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:55.990
of following the
succession of movement

00:25:55.990 --> 00:26:00.250
by depicting it in a pictorial
sequence that is entirely

00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:02.980
without the use of film.

00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:06.490
As you realize, however,
when you look at these slides

00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:09.370
is that the organism
is not only dead.

00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:10.930
It is also flat.

00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:14.510
It is extremely flat.

00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:16.300
And the main reason--

00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:18.880
this is why the details
are so interesting.

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:22.600
The main reason actually
why Ries could not

00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:26.320
observe his sperm tail's
rotate in the ovum

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:30.100
was that the sperm's
movement was rotational.

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:34.060
So movements happen in time,
but they do happen in space too.

00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:38.380
And how do you see a rotation
in an extremely flat object?

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:41.980
And to conquer this
space scientifically

00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:46.100
proved a very difficult task.

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:49.490
Around the same time
as Ries in Switzerland,

00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:52.260
the German embryologist
Ludwig Graper

00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:55.850
in [INAUDIBLE] published
his inquiries into the heart

00:26:55.850 --> 00:26:58.520
formation of birds.

00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:02.840
In this book, he
studies the origin

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:05.390
of so-called blood
islands, which

00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:08.120
give rise to the first
vessels that you can see.

00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:11.090
If you have ever opened a
chick embryo or a chicken egg,

00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:15.170
you can see these
delicate red network.

00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:22.280
And as again, as marginal as
the topic might seem to you,

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:24.920
it is actually a very
important question

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:28.790
to know where these cells come
from that, in the developing

00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:31.970
organism, form the
very first structures.

00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:35.420
And a primary question
is, do these cells

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:37.880
come to the place where
the structures form

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:41.540
through migration that is
moving back from other places

00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:45.860
or through multiplication, that
is, the cell division, which

00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:48.380
is an entirely different thing.

00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:51.230
But if movement is the
cause, where exactly

00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:52.790
do the cells come from?

00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:54.560
And in this case,
the question was,

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:58.400
it's not that important
from which of the three germ

00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:00.780
layers that are the first
structures in the egg

00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:02.790
they come from.

00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:05.420
And he did so.

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:09.230
Like the microscopic
slide, this is a depiction

00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:11.510
of a histological preparation.

00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:14.090
And Graper describes
in great detail

00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:17.960
how he applies all kinds
of acids, alcohol, dyes,

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:22.640
whatever to do the preparation
only to describe afterwards

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:27.720
how he studies motion in these
dead and fixed organisms.

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:30.470
And motion, it turns
out, is the measure

00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:34.070
of the distance between the
blood islands and the germ

00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:35.810
layers.

00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:39.890
But not being able to come
to a definite solution,

00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:43.820
he tentatively supposes that
the cells forming those islands

00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:48.580
must originate from the
inner of the germ layers.

00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:52.360
But this question still
was of interest to him.

00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:55.570
And four years later, he
moves to the observation

00:28:55.570 --> 00:28:57.730
of living embryos.

00:28:57.730 --> 00:29:00.490
And now he uses
vital dyes, and I

00:29:00.490 --> 00:29:02.710
should add a vital
piece of information

00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:06.580
that vital dyes don't mean that
they keep the object alive.

00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:10.570
They just postpone the
death of the embryo

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:12.970
for a couple of time.

00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:18.280
But this is enough to change the
entire scientific observation

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:20.830
of the regime
because now Graper is

00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:23.290
able to switch to
serial photographs

00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:28.340
instead of using the depictions
of the histological tissue.

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:32.500
And this is one
of those series he

00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:34.960
does, the series
of 16 photographs

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:37.210
of a particular embryo.

00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:40.120
And he says that these
photographs, I quote,

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:45.360
"have the advantage to allow the
repeated comparison of images

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:49.780
in, not only a straight
line, but also in reverse."

00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:53.200
That means there the
advantage of photography

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:57.250
is not its quality and the
precision of what it depicts,

00:29:57.250 --> 00:30:02.020
but rather that it enables
the comparability of images

00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:04.870
through a succession of images.

00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:08.110
And ultimately,
such serial images

00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:12.100
allow to condense
comparative measurements

00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:15.520
into a line as a
substrate of movement.

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:18.670
And the result here,
again, is not a photograph

00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:21.830
and it's not a depiction,
but it's a graph.

00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:23.860
And this graph
represents movement

00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:25.690
as a statistical phenomenon.

00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:27.460
So what you can see here--

00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:30.610
there are tiny, little letters
attached to the single lines

00:30:30.610 --> 00:30:34.480
and they refer to different
parts of the embryo.

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:37.060
And dotted lines
are meant to qualify

00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:40.950
whether the movements could
be sharply delineated,

00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:43.490
and the horizontal
line is intended

00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:48.140
to refer to the speed
of the movement.

00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:53.950
Another 15 years later, Graper
was finally advanced enough

00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:57.400
in his technology to register
the development of living

00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:59.680
chick embryos on film.

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:02.530
So what is running here in the
background is the formation.

00:31:02.530 --> 00:31:05.290
It's just a tiny
clip of the formation

00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:08.170
of the primitive streaks,
which in birds is

00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:11.560
the first major
structure to appear

00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:15.640
in the first days of
Incubation This is made visible

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:20.830
with the dye nile blue
sulfate, and the process

00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:22.780
that you can see
actually here now

00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:26.920
has been sped up about
some 2,000 times.

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:32.710
And I'm showing it primarily to
give you an idea of how blurred

00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:34.840
and to give you an
idea about the quality

00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:40.000
of these cinematographic
material.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.150
The cells that come together
to form the primitive streak

00:31:43.150 --> 00:31:46.340
originated from different
parts of the ovum

00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:49.240
and especially from
different spatial depth.

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:51.010
And there's some
part I won't go into,

00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:53.170
but there is a
beautiful conception

00:31:53.170 --> 00:31:55.280
of how these cells
forming the strains

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:59.770
are actually dancing and
form the dance of a polonaise

00:31:59.770 --> 00:32:01.740
to make these figures.

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:05.620
But all available technology--
and you can easily see it--

00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:08.620
did not really allow
or enable Graper

00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:12.070
to distinguish how exactly
these movements played out

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:15.170
in the three dimensional
space of the ovum.

00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:19.030
So consequently, he invented
and applied a new medium,

00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:22.330
and that is stereo
cinematography.

00:32:22.330 --> 00:32:25.270
Stereoscopic image--
you probably know that--

00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:27.130
are those which
are made separately

00:32:27.130 --> 00:32:29.680
for the left and the right eye.

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:31.960
And placing the images
next to another,

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:34.980
and if you're able to
have a cross eye look,

00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:38.590
you're able to see a
certain spatial image.

00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:42.700
And you can without any kind
of device, but there are also--

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:44.650
so if you can't
cross across, you

00:32:44.650 --> 00:32:47.230
can use any kinds of
prisms and devices.

00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:54.290
The stereo cinematographic
apparatus-- and this

00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:57.490
is actually a depiction of
it-- is far more than a simple

00:32:57.490 --> 00:32:58.570
optical device.

00:32:58.570 --> 00:33:01.210
It is an entire
experimental system,

00:33:01.210 --> 00:33:05.530
and it consists of
different optical lenses,

00:33:05.530 --> 00:33:06.880
prisms, and mirrors.

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:10.220
It has an incubator for the
organism to be kept alive,

00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:12.970
a heating section
for the microscope,

00:33:12.970 --> 00:33:15.730
and various lighting devices.

00:33:15.730 --> 00:33:18.280
The aim of stereo
cinematography was

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:20.740
to improve the
three dimensionality

00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:22.780
of the representation.

00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:25.360
And in order to
achieve this goal,

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:29.380
one records images for
the left and the right eye

00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:32.050
which are not taken
at the same time,

00:33:32.050 --> 00:33:35.560
but which are separated
by a delay of time.

00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:38.920
This is the secret, and
how this looks like--

00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:41.300
this image shows how that works.

00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:43.660
So what he does is
he films an embryo

00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:50.160
over the whole time of the
first of its development.

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:52.530
And this first picture,
the very first,

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:56.760
is taken after I think half an
hour after he started filming,

00:33:56.760 --> 00:34:03.150
and the following images are
stereo cinematographic images,

00:34:03.150 --> 00:34:06.720
which are taken with a
timed delay of 18 minutes,

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:09.520
the first one earlier
than the second.

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:13.530
So what stereoscopic
pictures allow

00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:19.110
is the simultaneous observation
of successive events in time.

00:34:19.110 --> 00:34:21.840
That means that the
movements of a cell

00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:25.770
can be translated into space
so that the movement can

00:34:25.770 --> 00:34:27.845
be traced-- its
cells can be traced,

00:34:27.845 --> 00:34:29.219
and it can be
traced whether they

00:34:29.219 --> 00:34:32.909
come from the superficial
areas of the ovum

00:34:32.909 --> 00:34:40.520
or if they move in from parts
further deeper into the tissue.

00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:44.239
Graper is an almost entirely
forgotten scientist today.

00:34:44.239 --> 00:34:46.949
He devoted basically
his whole career

00:34:46.949 --> 00:34:49.530
to the examination
of cell movement

00:34:49.530 --> 00:34:52.080
and its role in morphogenesis.

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:54.810
He devised other new
experiments and devices.

00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:57.270
He improved and
adapted them either

00:34:57.270 --> 00:35:01.140
to fix preparations on living
animals to space and time

00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:03.330
to photographs,
or moving images.

00:35:03.330 --> 00:35:05.760
He did anything to
encircle and solve

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:07.575
the puzzle of moving cells.

00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:14.180
Studying biological motion
is fascinating for historic

00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:17.150
and for a historian because
it has virtually not

00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:19.190
been studied at all.

00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:22.100
It may be even more
fascinating, though,

00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:25.580
because of its new presence
in contemporary biology, which

00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:27.920
might be more familiar to you.

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:30.110
Movement in and of
the living world

00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:34.370
was indeed a curiosity and
a performative spectacle

00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:35.900
in the 18th century.

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:39.650
It was an object of intense
experimental tinkering,

00:35:39.650 --> 00:35:43.400
a field of technological
innovation and testing

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:46.940
of pictorial forms,
media, and the rhetoric

00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:51.800
of these representations in
the 19th and 20th century.

00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:55.970
Over the last 50 years or so,
however, research into motion

00:35:55.970 --> 00:35:59.510
has emerged in a variety
of biological fields--

00:35:59.510 --> 00:36:04.250
in microbiology, with
a study of amoeba,

00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:07.340
where the motion of
leukocytes is examined,

00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:09.920
in embryology, as we
have seen, with a focus

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:13.760
on cell migration during the
process of morphogenesis,

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:17.090
in cancer research,
studying metastasis,

00:36:17.090 --> 00:36:19.250
and wound healing
and regeneration

00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:21.290
where your study
fibroblasts and how

00:36:21.290 --> 00:36:24.590
they move inside the
body to get to the places

00:36:24.590 --> 00:36:26.660
where they are needed.

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:29.390
Having been confined to
the margins of biology,

00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:34.940
research in motion seems to be
exploding in the 21st century.

00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:38.210
It is only two Radcliffe
public presentations ago--

00:36:38.210 --> 00:36:41.800
and that is maybe the time unit
we have been mostly living on

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:43.720
in this last year--

00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:47.330
that the Harvard Gazette
in my daily morning email

00:36:47.330 --> 00:36:50.930
feature articles which
you may have read as well

00:36:50.930 --> 00:36:52.830
in developments in this area.

00:36:52.830 --> 00:37:00.490
And I want to just
see if that works.

00:37:00.490 --> 00:37:07.150
This article on April 17 about
the interdisciplinary character

00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:09.700
of modern biological
research cooperating

00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:15.170
with engineers, computer
scientists, physicists,

00:37:15.170 --> 00:37:23.990
and this article following
on April 20 to boldly go.

00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:29.700
And what you see here in this,
I quote, in this first film,

00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:33.560
"you see how a migrating cancer
cell trails sticky appendages

00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:35.750
as it rolls through
a blood vessel

00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:39.170
and attempts to squeeze
through the vessel wall."

00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:41.030
And further down,
another example

00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:43.850
about this research
here, I quote,

00:37:43.850 --> 00:37:47.210
"you see how fiery orange
immune cells wriggles madly

00:37:47.210 --> 00:37:50.600
through a zebra fish's ear
while scooping up blue sugar

00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:53.510
particles along the way."

00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:55.440
And another week later on--

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:58.370
and this very same cell
made it to the image

00:37:58.370 --> 00:38:01.190
of the day of the
scientist as well.

00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:04.340
And here a week
later, on April 26,

00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:07.580
you have this
article from one many

00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:10.130
about developmental biology.

00:38:10.130 --> 00:38:12.620
What is this research about?

00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:17.030
21st century biology, in
particular systems biology,

00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:19.490
pursues new routes
of investigation

00:38:19.490 --> 00:38:23.180
into complexity and holistic
rather than reductionist

00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:27.260
approaches, into synthesis
rather than analysis,

00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:29.930
into model exemplars
rather than rules--

00:38:29.930 --> 00:38:32.210
into rules, pardon,
rather than laws.

00:38:32.210 --> 00:38:35.810
And studying life computational
and by aggregating

00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:39.800
huge amounts of data provides
new types of explanation

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:41.750
different from
those that have been

00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:44.360
operational in the
sciences for centuries,

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:49.430
in particular observation,
experiment, and theory.

00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:52.490
Operating on the level
of biological systems,

00:38:52.490 --> 00:38:55.760
the aim of the scientific
inquiry into the living world

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:58.760
is also changing
towards the analysis

00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:03.620
of the behavior of the systems
and towards the prediction

00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:05.660
of that behavior.

00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:08.660
In addition, perhaps the
single most revolutionary

00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:11.270
technological
advancement to affect

00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:14.270
the cause of 21st
century life sciences

00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:16.195
has been life cell imaging.

00:39:16.195 --> 00:39:18.710
Life cell imaging
enables scientists

00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:22.640
to emerge fluorescent
labeled and marked cells

00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:26.210
in living organisms and
study them over time

00:39:26.210 --> 00:39:29.180
under life conditions.

00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:31.430
And with the scientific
framework shifting

00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:34.690
and the technology
becoming widely available,

00:39:34.690 --> 00:39:38.600
motion finally seems to
be reaching center stage.

00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:40.940
And to give you one last
example from the field

00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:44.510
of developmental biology
where systems approaches

00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:48.200
are prominent, which aim
to build what is variously

00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:53.090
called a digital embryo
or in-vivo imaging

00:39:53.090 --> 00:39:57.050
or the in toto representation
of development.

00:39:57.050 --> 00:40:00.770
And the aim here is indeed
to trace every single cell

00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:04.640
from every possible
angle in every moment

00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:08.310
of the whole course
of development.

00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:12.630
So this technology that is used
is called digital scanned laser

00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:15.230
light sheet
fluorescent microscopy,

00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:18.810
and it is as complicated
as the name suggests.

00:40:18.810 --> 00:40:20.990
So I will only give
you a very brief idea

00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:24.500
because I think, on the
other hand, it's fascinating.

00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:26.150
First, you choose
a model organism,

00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:29.450
which is usually zebrafish
or drosophila and zebrafish

00:40:29.450 --> 00:40:32.450
because it's a
transparent organism.

00:40:32.450 --> 00:40:36.260
And this of course you
have to keep alive.

00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:40.240
And then in the first
step, you choose an object

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:43.090
of interest, which is
usually the cell, the cell

00:40:43.090 --> 00:40:46.300
nucleus or the cell membrane,
which you have to mark

00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:48.910
with the fluorescent marker.

00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:51.400
And as a light
source, the microscope

00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:55.270
doesn't use optical normal
light, but a laser beam which

00:40:55.270 --> 00:41:01.220
optically cuts the object, the
organism in very thin image

00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:04.360
slices using a camera,
which is detecting

00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:09.400
the fluorescence emitted
that you previously injected.

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:13.060
And now the embryo is moved
slightly horizontally,

00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:15.550
and you create over
certain intervals

00:41:15.550 --> 00:41:19.560
ever new such of
these image slices.

00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:23.470
And once completely sliced,
the embryo is rotated

00:41:23.470 --> 00:41:27.250
and you do the slicing again
and you scan the embryo

00:41:27.250 --> 00:41:28.660
entirely again.

00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:31.120
And with this
experimental setup,

00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:34.030
you're able to make high
resolution images that

00:41:34.030 --> 00:41:38.770
is at the level of single
cells at high imaging speed,

00:41:38.770 --> 00:41:40.930
and you stack the
two dimensional image

00:41:40.930 --> 00:41:44.050
slices created by
the optical laser

00:41:44.050 --> 00:41:47.960
together to create three
dimensional representations,

00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:52.480
which are then finally
animated over time.

00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:59.980
So to give you an idea, you
can see movement trajectories

00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:08.380
of cells such as
these, and these

00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:12.280
are the films that were released
on the Science website in 2008

00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:14.680
about the digital
embryo project.

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:16.420
So we know that
development starts

00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:20.110
with a single cell dividing
into all successful cells,

00:42:20.110 --> 00:42:24.460
shaping the future organism
by division and movement.

00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:28.180
And in these images,
every illuminated spot

00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:30.290
represents a single cell.

00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:32.950
And in this animation,
you have the animal

00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:36.430
and the vegetative view,
which are presented next

00:42:36.430 --> 00:42:39.370
to one another.

00:42:39.370 --> 00:42:43.090
In another
representation, here you

00:42:43.090 --> 00:42:45.850
have what I briefly explained.

00:42:45.850 --> 00:42:48.430
You have the
animation is showing

00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:54.150
how you have the images taken at
different angles, at 90 or 180

00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:56.980
and 270 degrees.

00:42:56.980 --> 00:43:00.940
And in another [INAUDIBLE],, you
see the movement of the cells.

00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:09.610
And here you see how
these two representation

00:43:09.610 --> 00:43:12.400
are animated and presented
and fused together

00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:17.350
in a rotational representation
of the going around the embryo

00:43:17.350 --> 00:43:18.760
so to speak.

00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:22.330
And in a final
image I would like

00:43:22.330 --> 00:43:28.060
to show you here is a long term
imaging of the zebrafish embryo

00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:32.140
here of 67 hours,
which is condensed

00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:36.140
into an animation of 44 seconds.

00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:39.160
In these animations, we see
development taking place

00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:42.720
in the encapsulated
space of a s sphere.

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:44.920
The gradual coming
into being of forms

00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:48.850
acquires the character of an
almost ghostly apparition.

00:43:48.850 --> 00:43:51.220
Dots appear out of
nowhere, and the eye

00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:55.360
perceives the shaping of form
as if an invisible soap bubble

00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:58.030
gradually fills up with action.

00:43:58.030 --> 00:44:01.480
And it is important to know here
that it is movement alone that

00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:05.660
brings about and drives the
formation of the embryo.

00:44:05.660 --> 00:44:07.690
So the striking colors
which you see here

00:44:07.690 --> 00:44:11.590
and which have been
absent in the first films

00:44:11.590 --> 00:44:15.790
provide additional information
about the speed, for example,

00:44:15.790 --> 00:44:17.800
of the direction of movement.

00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:21.470
It's a color annotation
of the moving entity.

00:44:21.470 --> 00:44:23.470
But it is important
that the movements here

00:44:23.470 --> 00:44:26.140
define their own
space without our

00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:29.440
being able to know exactly
what delimits this space

00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:32.080
and whether the boundaries
are set from outside

00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:34.690
or intrinsic to the objects.

00:44:34.690 --> 00:44:36.490
Where there clearly
are contours,

00:44:36.490 --> 00:44:39.710
the space inside and
outside is black.

00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:42.280
We gaze into development
as if it were

00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:45.310
revealed inside a crystal ball.

00:44:45.310 --> 00:44:49.240
And indeed, the ultimate goal
of developmental projects

00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:51.850
like these is to
construct, I quote,

00:44:51.850 --> 00:44:57.630
"a developmental computer model
with truly predictive power."

00:44:57.630 --> 00:44:59.760
And usually scientists
and journalists

00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:03.930
refer to these live cell
or in-vivo visualizations

00:45:03.930 --> 00:45:05.340
as movies.

00:45:05.340 --> 00:45:08.040
That is the standard word used.

00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:12.680
I think that speaking of
movies is highly problematic,

00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:15.300
and I prefer to
talk of animation.

00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:19.560
And your first association with
animations is clearly cartoons,

00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:20.910
I suppose.

00:45:20.910 --> 00:45:24.480
But a more general definition
was given by the film scholar

00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:25.620
Tom Gunning.

00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:27.380
And as he puts it--
and I find this

00:45:27.380 --> 00:45:29.460
is a very useful
differentiation--

00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:33.450
is that animations
are moving images

00:45:33.450 --> 00:45:36.630
that have been
artificially made to move

00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:39.780
rather than movement
automatically captured

00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:43.080
by the devices such as
continuous motion picture

00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:44.460
photography.

00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:47.340
So speaking of animations
instead of films

00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:50.970
points to the artificiality
of these images.

00:45:50.970 --> 00:45:52.860
Just like in
cartoons, we should,

00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:56.370
when we see such animations,
draw our attention

00:45:56.370 --> 00:45:58.470
to the conditions
of their making.

00:45:58.470 --> 00:46:00.870
And I have not given
you any detail of how

00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:03.180
these animations are made.

00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:06.840
It is sufficient maybe
to say that experimenting

00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:10.560
upon the living body,
collecting data, and imaging

00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:13.380
these processes as
they unfold in time

00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:15.990
are performed in unison.

00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:18.840
And what we see as an
event is the result

00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:21.750
of several conversions
and translation

00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:24.450
between the organism,
the computation,

00:46:24.450 --> 00:46:27.600
and its visual representation.

00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:29.670
And I find-- and I leave that--

00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:32.130
I find the most
interesting part of it--

00:46:32.130 --> 00:46:35.850
and I would like to
discuss this in the Q&amp;A--

00:46:35.850 --> 00:46:39.690
is what you actually see
here in these animations

00:46:39.690 --> 00:46:44.340
is that you see individual
entities that are pixels

00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:47.220
moving in these images
that are referring

00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:51.360
to a morphological structure,
which is not the actual cell,

00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:54.510
but the depiction of
the cell featuring

00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:58.980
average properties, that is
statistically mathematically

00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:00.510
gained properties.

00:47:00.510 --> 00:47:03.090
And I find this
entirely fascinating.

00:47:03.090 --> 00:47:06.530
But I would love to discuss
this with a biologist.

00:47:06.530 --> 00:47:10.250
But before doing so I, want
to finally come to an end,

00:47:10.250 --> 00:47:13.800
or rather I will
come to two endings.

00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:15.300
And that has another reason.

00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:20.760
So what I wanted to say before
the end is that early pioneers

00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:22.980
in biological
cinematography, they

00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:26.010
were convinced that the
moving images finally

00:47:26.010 --> 00:47:30.000
unveiled the truth of life as
the camera captured movement

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.620
automatically.

00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:34.170
Talking of computer
visualizations

00:47:34.170 --> 00:47:37.110
as movies suggests
a continuation

00:47:37.110 --> 00:47:40.080
of this understanding,
but is it still true

00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:44.790
that life imaging can convince
us of the truth of life?

00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:47.550
Eric Betzig, a pioneer
in the development

00:47:47.550 --> 00:47:52.830
of fluorescence microscopy, who
actually in 2014 was awarded

00:47:52.830 --> 00:47:56.940
the Nobel Prize in chemistry
for exactly this technology,

00:47:56.940 --> 00:47:58.800
reminds us to be skeptical.

00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:02.190
I quote, "it is often said
that seeing is believing.

00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:04.200
But when it comes
to cell biology,

00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:07.350
I think the more appropriate
question is when can we

00:48:07.350 --> 00:48:09.600
believe what we see.

00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:11.700
And when it comes to
motion, the question

00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:16.200
actually is, what is it
that we believe we see."

00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:21.900
And I show you in this
very first slide--

00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:24.120
we see various
kinds of movements--

00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:26.820
swimming, climbing,
rolling, or crawling.

00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:30.120
And speaking of
animations reminds us

00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:33.320
that making movement
visible is not only

00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:36.060
displaying motion
but also playing

00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:38.100
with the production of motion.

00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:42.150
And indeed, what we see here
is a millimeter small highly

00:48:42.150 --> 00:48:46.630
elastic robot whose movements
are magnetically actuated.

00:48:46.630 --> 00:48:53.610
And you can see this, that is
research done at the Max Planck

00:48:53.610 --> 00:48:57.060
Institute in Germany.

00:48:57.060 --> 00:49:05.570
And you see how this really
millimeter small object is

00:49:05.570 --> 00:49:08.720
made to move in various ways.

00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:11.360
You can see here.

00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:13.850
And The New York Times
reported on this research

00:49:13.850 --> 00:49:16.370
in January of this year.

00:49:16.370 --> 00:49:18.530
And the headline of
the article read,

00:49:18.530 --> 00:49:22.190
this tiny robot walks,
crawls, jumps, and swims,

00:49:22.190 --> 00:49:24.730
but it is not alive.

00:49:24.730 --> 00:49:27.800
Playing with the production
of motion inevitably

00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:31.070
also involves playing with
our understanding of life.

00:49:31.070 --> 00:49:32.860
Thank you.
