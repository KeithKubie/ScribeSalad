00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.882
We are going to start today in
a serious way on the

00:00:12.882 --> 00:00:17.705
inhomogenous equation,
second-order linear

00:00:17.705 --> 00:00:22.058
differential,
I'll simply write it out

00:00:22.058 --> 00:00:28.294
instead of writing out all the
words which go with it.

00:00:28.294 --> 00:00:35.000
So, such an equation looks
like, the second-order equation

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.647
is going to look like y double
prime plus p of x,

00:00:40.647 --> 00:00:47.991
t, x plus q of x times y.
Now, up to now the right-hand

00:00:47.991 --> 00:00:53.147
side has been zero.
So, now we are going to make it

00:00:53.147 --> 00:00:57.479
not be zero.
So, this is going to be f of x.

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:00.470
In the most frequent

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.843
applications,
x is time.

00:01:02.843 --> 00:01:08.000
x is usually time,
often, but not always.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.030
So, maybe just for today,
I will use X in talking about

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.383
the general theory.
And, from now on,

00:01:16.383 --> 00:01:22.065
I'll probably make X equal time
because that's what is most of

00:01:22.065 --> 00:01:27.654
the time in the applications.
So, this is the part we've been

00:01:27.654 --> 00:01:31.753
studying up until now.
It has a lot of names.

00:01:31.753 --> 00:01:35.479
It's input, signal,
commas between those,

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.484
a driving term,
or sometimes it's called the

00:01:39.484 --> 00:01:44.160
forcing term.
You'll see all of these in the

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.554
literature, and it pretty much
depends upon what course you're

00:01:48.554 --> 00:01:52.155
sitting at, what the professor
habitually calls it.

00:01:52.155 --> 00:01:55.468
I will try to use all these
terms now and then,

00:01:55.468 --> 00:01:59.357
probably most often I will
lapse into input as the most

00:01:59.357 --> 00:02:01.806
generic term,
suggesting nothing in

00:02:01.806 --> 00:02:05.191
particular, and therefore,
equally acceptable or

00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:09.651
unacceptable to everybody.
The response,

00:02:09.651 --> 00:02:15.116
the solution,
then, the solution as you know

00:02:15.116 --> 00:02:20.325
is then called the response.
The response,

00:02:20.325 --> 00:02:24.392
sometimes it's called the
output.

00:02:24.392 --> 00:02:31.000
I think I'll stick pretty much
with response.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.894
So, I'm using pretty much the
same terminology we use for

00:02:35.894 --> 00:02:40.439
studying first-order equations.
Now, as you will see,

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:45.333
the reason we had to study the
homogeneous case first was

00:02:45.333 --> 00:02:50.577
because you cannot solve this
without knowing the homogeneous

00:02:50.577 --> 00:02:53.898
solutions.
So, that's the inhomogeneous

00:02:53.898 --> 00:02:56.432
case.
But the homogeneous one,

00:02:56.432 --> 00:03:01.676
the corresponding homogeneous
thing, y double prime plus p of

00:03:01.676 --> 00:03:06.745
x y prime plus q of x times y
equals zero

00:03:06.745 --> 00:03:11.640
is an essential
part of the solution to this

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.304
equation.
That's called,

00:03:15.304 --> 00:03:19.311
therefore, it has names.
Now, unfortunately,

00:03:19.311 --> 00:03:24.810
it doesn't have a single name.
I don't know what to call it,

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.308
but I think I'll probably call
it the associated homogeneous

00:03:30.308 --> 00:03:34.315
equation, or ODE,
the associated homogeneous

00:03:34.315 --> 00:03:40.000
equation, the one associated to
the guy on the left.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.013
It's also called the reduced
equation by some people.

00:03:44.013 --> 00:03:48.412
There is some other term for
it, which escapes me totally,

00:03:48.412 --> 00:03:52.040
but what the heck.
Now, its solution has a name.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.513
So, its solution,
of course, doesn't depend on

00:03:55.513 --> 00:03:58.909
anything in particular,
the general solution,

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:03.000
because the right-hand side is
always zero.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.285
So, its solution,
we know can be written as y

00:04:06.285 --> 00:04:10.093
equals in the form c1 y1 plus c2
y2,

00:04:10.093 --> 00:04:14.349
where y1 and y2 are any two
independent solutions of that,

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:17.783
and then c1's and c2's are
arbitrary constants.

00:04:17.783 --> 00:04:20.920
Now, what you are looking at
this equation,

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.279
you're going to need this also.
And therefore,

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:26.893
it has a name.
It has various names.

00:04:26.893 --> 00:04:31.000
Sometimes there is a subscript,
c, there.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.139
Sometimes there's a subscript,
h.

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:39.534
Sometimes there's no subscript
at all, which is the most

00:04:39.534 --> 00:04:42.379
confusing of all.
But, anyway,

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:47.382
what's the name given to it?
Well, there is no name.

00:04:47.382 --> 00:04:53.268
Many books call it the solution
to the associated homogeneous

00:04:53.268 --> 00:04:56.310
equation.
That's maximally long.

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:02.000
Your book calls it the
complementary solution.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.282
Many people call it that,
and many will look at you with

00:05:06.282 --> 00:05:10.176
a blank, who know differential
equations very well,

00:05:10.176 --> 00:05:14.926
and will not have the faintest
idea what you're talking about.

00:05:14.926 --> 00:05:18.819
If you call it (y)h,
then you are thinking of it as

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:21.934
the solution;
the h is for homogeneous to

00:05:21.934 --> 00:05:26.295
indicate it's the solution.
So, it's the solution to the,

00:05:26.295 --> 00:05:30.811
I'm not going to write that.
You put it in her books if you

00:05:30.811 --> 00:05:33.459
like writing.
Write solution to the

00:05:33.459 --> 00:05:36.340
associated homogeneous equation,
y(h).

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:41.981
But, it's all the same thing.
Now, or the solution to the

00:05:41.981 --> 00:05:45.064
reduced equation,
I see I have in my notes.

00:05:45.064 --> 00:05:48.587
Okay, good, the solution to the
reduced equation,

00:05:48.587 --> 00:05:50.642
too.
Okay, now, the examples,

00:05:50.642 --> 00:05:53.871
there are, of course,
two classical examples,

00:05:53.871 --> 00:05:57.688
of which you know one.
But, use them as the model for

00:05:57.688 --> 00:06:02.018
what solutions of these things
should look like and how they

00:06:02.018 --> 00:06:06.500
should behave.
So, the model you know already

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:11.416
is the one, I won't make the
leading coefficient one because

00:06:11.416 --> 00:06:15.166
it usually isn't,
is the one, m x double prime,

00:06:15.166 --> 00:06:18.750
so t is the
independent variable,

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:23.416
plus b x prime plus k x equals
f of t.

00:06:23.416 --> 00:06:26.500
That's the spring-mass system,

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:32.550
the spring-mass-dashpot system.
Mass, the damping constant and

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.694
the spring constant,
except up to now,

00:06:35.694 --> 00:06:40.540
it's always been zero here.
What does this f of t

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:43.855
represent?
Well, if you think of the way

00:06:43.855 --> 00:06:49.040
in which I derived the equation,
the mx, that was the Newton's

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.420
law.
That's the acceleration.

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:55.160
So, it's the acceleration,
the mass times the

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.625
acceleration.
By Newton's law,

00:06:57.625 --> 00:07:04.000
this is equal to the imposed
force on the little mass truck.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.214
Okay, you got that truck,
there.

00:07:06.214 --> 00:07:09.642
I'm not going to draw the truck
for the nth time.

00:07:09.642 --> 00:07:13.000
You'll have to imagine it.
So, here's our truck.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.357
Okay, forces are acting on it.
Remember, the forces were 

00:07:17.357 --> 00:07:20.000
minus kx.
That came from the spring.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.071
There was a force,
minus b x prime.

00:07:23.071 --> 00:07:26.285
That came from the dashpot,
the damping force.

00:07:26.285 --> 00:07:30.000
So, this other guy is f of t.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.489
What's this?
This is the external force,

00:07:32.489 --> 00:07:34.723
which is acting out.
In other words,

00:07:34.723 --> 00:07:38.361
instead of the little truck
going back and forth and doing

00:07:38.361 --> 00:07:41.553
its own thing all by itself,
here's someone with an

00:07:41.553 --> 00:07:44.425
electromagnet,
and the mass it's carrying is a

00:07:44.425 --> 00:07:47.617
big pile of iron ore.
You're turning it on and off,

00:07:47.617 --> 00:07:51.191
and pulling that thing from
afar where nobody can see it.

00:07:51.191 --> 00:07:55.021
So, this is the external force.
Now, think, that is the model

00:07:55.021 --> 00:08:00.000
you must have in your mind of
how these equations are treated.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.204
In other words,
when f of t is zero,

00:08:03.204 --> 00:08:07.377
the system is passive.
There is no external force on

00:08:07.377 --> 00:08:10.581
it when this is zero.
The system is sitting,

00:08:10.581 --> 00:08:14.233
and just doing what it wants to
do, all by itself.

00:08:14.233 --> 00:08:17.362
You wanted up by giving it an
initial push,

00:08:17.362 --> 00:08:20.492
and putting its initial
position somewhere.

00:08:20.492 --> 00:08:23.324
But after that,
you lay your hands off.

00:08:23.324 --> 00:08:27.274
The system then just passively
responds to its initial

00:08:27.274 --> 00:08:31.000
conditions and does what it
wants.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.205
The other model is that you
don't let it respond the way it

00:08:35.205 --> 00:08:37.960
wants to.
You force it from the outside

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:40.570
by pushing it with an external
force.

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:44.485
Now, those are clearly two
entirely different problems:

00:08:44.485 --> 00:08:48.399
what it does by itself,
or what it does when it's acted

00:08:48.399 --> 00:08:51.590
on from outside.
And, when I explained to you

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:55.940
how the thing is to be solved,
you have to keep in mind those

00:08:55.940 --> 00:09:00.000
two models.
So, this is the forced system.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.967
I'll just use the word,
forced system,

00:09:02.967 --> 00:09:07.699
that's where f of t is
not zero, versus the passive

00:09:07.699 --> 00:09:11.468
system where there is no
external applied force.

00:09:11.468 --> 00:09:14.436
The passive system,
the forced system,

00:09:14.436 --> 00:09:18.686
now, you have to both,
even if you wanted to solve the

00:09:18.686 --> 00:09:22.295
forced system,
the way the system would behave

00:09:22.295 --> 00:09:27.187
if nothing would be done to it
from the outside is nonetheless

00:09:27.187 --> 00:09:32.000
going to be an important part of
the solution.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.700
And, I won't be able to give
you that solution without

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:38.981
knowing this also.
Now, I'd like to give you the

00:09:38.981 --> 00:09:42.472
other model very rapidly because
it's in your book.

00:09:42.472 --> 00:09:45.195
It's in the problems I have to
give you.

00:09:45.195 --> 00:09:48.128
You know, it's part of
everybody's culture,

00:09:48.128 --> 00:09:52.177
whether they like it or not.
So, that's example number one.

00:09:52.177 --> 00:09:55.599
Example number two,
which follows the differential

00:09:55.599 --> 00:09:59.718
equation just as perfectly as
the spring-mass-dashpot system

00:09:59.718 --> 00:10:04.367
is the simple electric circuit.
The inductance,

00:10:04.367 --> 00:10:08.013
you don't know yet what an
inductance is,

00:10:08.013 --> 00:10:11.477
officially, but you will,
a resistance,

00:10:11.477 --> 00:10:15.852
sorry, that's okay,
put the capacitance up there,

00:10:15.852 --> 00:10:18.951
resistance, and then maybe a
thing.

00:10:18.951 --> 00:10:24.056
So, this is a resistance.
I think you know these symbols.

00:10:24.056 --> 00:10:28.887
By now, you certainly know the
system for capacitance.

00:10:28.887 --> 00:10:34.356
What I mean when I say C is the
capacitance, you may not know

00:10:34.356 --> 00:10:39.100
yet what L is.
That's called the inductance.

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:43.518
So, this is something called a
coil because it looks like one.

00:10:43.518 --> 00:10:45.908
L is what's called its
inductance.

00:10:45.908 --> 00:10:50.037
And, the differential equation,
there are two differential

00:10:50.037 --> 00:10:52.572
equations which can be used in
this.

00:10:52.572 --> 00:10:56.990
They are essentially the same.
One is simply the derivative of

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:59.670
the other.
Both differential equations

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:04.088
come from Kirchhoff's voltage
law, that the sum of the voltage

00:11:04.088 --> 00:11:08.000
drops as you move around the
circuit --

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.596
-- has to be zero because
otherwise, I don't have to,

00:11:11.596 --> 00:11:14.570
that's because of somebody's
law, Kirchhoff,

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:17.613
with two h's.
The sum of the voltage drops to

00:11:17.613 --> 00:11:21.141
zero, and now you know the
voltage drop across this,

00:11:21.141 --> 00:11:25.291
and you know the voltage drop
across that because you learned

00:11:25.291 --> 00:11:27.089
in 8.02.
You will, one day,

00:11:27.089 --> 00:11:29.440
learn the voltage drop across
this.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:32.828
But, I already know it.
It's Li.

00:11:32.828 --> 00:11:37.902
So, i is the current.
I'll write this thing in its

00:11:37.902 --> 00:11:42.872
primitive form first.
So, i is the current that's

00:11:42.872 --> 00:11:47.532
flowing in the circuit.
q is the charge on the

00:11:47.532 --> 00:11:51.985
capacitance.
So, the voltage drop across the

00:11:51.985 --> 00:11:57.473
coil is L times i.
The voltage shop across the,

00:11:57.473 --> 00:12:02.029
Li prime,
the voltage drop across the

00:12:02.029 --> 00:12:07.000
resistance is,
well, you know that.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.885
And, the voltage shop across
the capacitance is q 

00:12:10.885 --> 00:12:13.124
divided by C.
And so, that's equal to,

00:12:13.124 --> 00:12:16.548
well, it's equal to zero,
except if there's a battery

00:12:16.548 --> 00:12:19.380
here or something generating a
voltage drop,

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:21.948
so, let's call that E is a
generic word.

00:12:21.948 --> 00:12:24.846
E could be a battery.
It could be a source of

00:12:24.846 --> 00:12:27.480
alternating current,
something like that.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:31.299
But, there's a voltage drop
across it, and I'm giving E the

00:12:31.299 --> 00:12:35.566
name of the voltage drop.
So, and then there's the

00:12:35.566 --> 00:12:38.503
question of the signs,
which I know I'll never

00:12:38.503 --> 00:12:41.244
understand.
But, let's assume you've chosen

00:12:41.244 --> 00:12:44.834
the sign convention so that this
comes out nicely on the

00:12:44.834 --> 00:12:47.510
right-hand side.
So, this might be varying

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:50.382
sinusoidally,
in which case you'd have source

00:12:50.382 --> 00:12:53.515
of alternating current.
Or, it might be constant,

00:12:53.515 --> 00:12:56.778
in which that would be a
battery, a little dry cell

00:12:56.778 --> 00:12:59.846
giving you direct current of a
constant voltage,

00:12:59.846 --> 00:13:03.808
stuff like that.
So, you could make this minus

00:13:03.808 --> 00:13:07.114
if you want, but everything will
have the wrong signs,

00:13:07.114 --> 00:13:09.734
so don't do it.
Now, this doesn't look like

00:13:09.734 --> 00:13:13.227
what it's supposed to look like
because it's got q and i.

00:13:13.227 --> 00:13:17.156
So, the final thing you have to
know is that q prime is 

00:13:17.156 --> 00:13:19.776
equal to i.
The rate at which that charge

00:13:19.776 --> 00:13:23.643
leaves the condenser and hurries
around the circuit to find its

00:13:23.643 --> 00:13:27.074
little soul mate on the other
side is the current that's

00:13:27.074 --> 00:13:30.068
flowing in the circuit.
That's why current flows,

00:13:30.068 --> 00:13:35.131
except nothing really happens.
Electrons just push on each

00:13:35.131 --> 00:13:37.894
other, and they stay where they
are.

00:13:37.894 --> 00:13:42.552
I don't understand this at all.
So, if I differentiate this,

00:13:42.552 --> 00:13:46.578
you can do two things.
Either you could integrate i,

00:13:46.578 --> 00:13:50.210
and expressed the thing
entirely in terms of q,

00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:54.868
or you can differentiate it,
and express everything in terms

00:13:54.868 --> 00:13:57.394
of i.
Your book does nicely both,

00:13:57.394 --> 00:14:02.021
does not take sides.
So, let's differentiate it,

00:14:02.021 --> 00:14:06.664
and then it will look like L i
double prime plus R i prime plus

00:14:06.664 --> 00:14:09.809
i divided by C equals,

00:14:09.809 --> 00:14:12.729
and now, watch out,
you have now not the

00:14:12.729 --> 00:14:15.649
electromotive force,
but its derivative.

00:14:15.649 --> 00:14:19.917
So, if you were so unfortunate
as to put a little dry cell

00:14:19.917 --> 00:14:24.410
there, now you've got nothing,
and you've got the homogeneous

00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:25.683
case.
That's okay.

00:14:25.683 --> 00:14:28.154
Where are the erasers?
One eraser?

00:14:28.154 --> 00:14:31.000
I don't believe this.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.116
So, there's the equation.
There are our two equations.

00:14:47.116 --> 00:14:50.300
Why don't we put them up in
colored chalk.

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:54.728
There's the spring equation.
And, here's the equation that

00:14:54.728 --> 00:14:58.456
governs the current,
for how the current flows in

00:14:58.456 --> 00:15:01.097
that circuit.
And now, you can see,

00:15:01.097 --> 00:15:04.281
again, what does it mean?
If this is zero,

00:15:04.281 --> 00:15:07.310
for example,
if I have a dry cell there,

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:11.349
or if I have nothing at all in
the circuit, then this

00:15:11.349 --> 00:15:16.465
represents the passive circuit.
It's just sitting there.

00:15:16.465 --> 00:15:20.250
It wouldn't do anything at all,
except that you've put a charge

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:22.875
on the capacitor,
and waited, and of course,

00:15:22.875 --> 00:15:26.049
when you put a charge on there,
it's got a discharge,

00:15:26.049 --> 00:15:29.345
and discharges through the
circuit, and swings back and

00:15:29.345 --> 00:15:32.520
forth a little bit if it's
under-damped until finally

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:36.000
towards the end the current dies
away to zero.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.940
But, what usually happens is
that you drive this passive

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:44.238
circuit by putting an effective
E in it, and then you want to

00:15:44.238 --> 00:15:48.537
know how the current behaves.
So, those are the two problems,

00:15:48.537 --> 00:15:52.692
the passive circuit without an
applied electromotive force,

00:15:52.692 --> 00:15:56.776
or plugging it into the wall,
and wanting it to do things.

00:15:56.776 --> 00:16:00.000
That's the normal state of
affairs.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.975
People don't want passive
circuits, they want circuits

00:16:03.975 --> 00:16:07.950
which do things because,
okay, that's why they want to

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:11.774
solve inhomogeneous equations
instead of homogeneous

00:16:11.774 --> 00:16:13.575
equations.
But as I said,

00:16:13.575 --> 00:16:16.649
you have to do the homogeneous
case first.

00:16:16.649 --> 00:16:20.325
Okay, you are now officially
responsible for this,

00:16:20.325 --> 00:16:24.450
and I don't care that you
haven't had it in physics yet.

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:30.000
You will before the next exam.
So, I don't even feel guilty.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.303
But, you're going to start
using it on the problem set

00:16:34.303 --> 00:16:37.307
right away.
So, it's never too soon to

00:16:37.307 --> 00:16:41.042
start learning it.
Okay, now, the main theorem,

00:16:41.042 --> 00:16:44.696
I now want to go,
so that was just examples to

00:16:44.696 --> 00:16:49.487
give you some physical feeling
for the sorts of differential

00:16:49.487 --> 00:16:52.085
equations we'll be talking
about.

00:16:52.085 --> 00:16:56.713
I now want to tell you briefly
about the key theorem about

00:16:56.713 --> 00:16:59.311
solving the homogeneous
equation.

00:16:59.311 --> 00:17:04.021
So, the main theorem about
solving the homogeneous equation

00:17:04.021 --> 00:17:09.993
is, the inhomogeneous equation.
So, I'm going to write the

00:17:09.993 --> 00:17:14.440
inhomogeneous equation out.
I'm going to make the left-hand

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:18.121
side a linear operator,
and am going to write the

00:17:18.121 --> 00:17:21.341
equation as Ly equals f of x.

00:17:21.341 --> 00:17:23.872
That's the inhomogeneous
equation.

00:17:23.872 --> 00:17:28.319
So, L is the linear operator,
second order because I'm only

00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:32.000
talking about second-order
equations.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.262
L is a linear operator,
and then this is the

00:17:37.262 --> 00:17:43.259
differential equation.
So, here's our differential

00:17:43.259 --> 00:17:48.155
equation.
It's inhomogeneous because it's

00:17:48.155 --> 00:17:53.662
go the f of x on the
right hand side.

00:17:53.662 --> 00:18:00.271
And, what the theorem says is
that the solution has the

00:18:00.271 --> 00:18:05.901
following form,
y sub p, I'll explain what that

00:18:05.901 --> 00:18:13.000
is in just a moment,
plus y sub c.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.155
So, the hypothesis is we've got
the linear equation,

00:18:17.155 --> 00:18:21.718
and the conclusion is that
that's what its solution looks

00:18:21.718 --> 00:18:24.407
like.
Now, you already know what y

00:18:24.407 --> 00:18:27.014
sub c looks like.
In other words,

00:18:27.014 --> 00:18:31.251
if I write this out in more
detail, it would be i.e.,

00:18:31.251 --> 00:18:35.000
department of fuller
explanation, --

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.763
-- the general solution looks
like y equals yp,

00:18:38.763 --> 00:18:43.836
and then this thing is going to
look like an arbitrary constant

00:18:43.836 --> 00:18:47.436
times y1 plus an arbitrary
constant times y2,

00:18:47.436 --> 00:18:51.772
where these are solutions of
the homogeneous equation.

00:18:51.772 --> 00:18:55.863
So, Yc looks like this part,
and the yp, what's yp?

00:18:55.863 --> 00:19:00.363
p stands for particular,
the most confusing word in this

00:19:00.363 --> 00:19:04.974
subject.
But, you've got at least four

00:19:04.974 --> 00:19:10.410
weeks to learn what it means.
Okay, yp is a particular

00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:14.717
solution to Ly equals f of x.

00:19:14.717 --> 00:19:19.948
Now, I'm not going to explain
what particular means.

00:19:19.948 --> 00:19:24.564
First, I'll chat as if you knew
what it meant,

00:19:24.564 --> 00:19:30.000
and then we'll see if you have
picked it up.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.824
In other words,
the procedure for solving this

00:19:33.824 --> 00:19:36.628
equation is composed of two
steps.

00:19:36.628 --> 00:19:40.028
First, to find this part.
In other words,

00:19:40.028 --> 00:19:44.277
to find the complementary
solution, in other words,

00:19:44.277 --> 00:19:48.101
to do what we've been doing for
the last week,

00:19:48.101 --> 00:19:53.371
solve not the equation you are
given, but the reduced equation.

00:19:53.371 --> 00:19:56.260
So, the first step is to find
this.

00:19:56.260 --> 00:20:01.301
The second step is to find yp.
Now, what's yp?

00:20:01.301 --> 00:20:05.552
yp is a particular solution to
the whole equation.

00:20:05.552 --> 00:20:09.196
Yeah, but which one?
Well, if it's any one,

00:20:09.196 --> 00:20:12.753
then it's not a particular
solution, yeah.

00:20:12.753 --> 00:20:17.698
I say, unfortunately the word
particular here is not being

00:20:17.698 --> 00:20:22.904
used in exactly the same sense
in which most people use it in

00:20:22.904 --> 00:20:26.894
ordinary English.
It's a perfectly valid way to

00:20:26.894 --> 00:20:29.237
use it.
It's just confusing,

00:20:29.237 --> 00:20:33.228
and no one has ever come up
with a better word.

00:20:33.228 --> 00:20:38.000
So, particular means any one
solution.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:45.131
Any one will do.
Okay, even these have slightly

00:20:45.131 --> 00:20:51.953
different meanings.
Any questions about this?

00:20:51.953 --> 00:20:58.000
I refuse to answer them.
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:03.927
Now, well, examples of course
will make it all clear.

00:21:03.927 --> 00:21:08.601
But I'd like,
first, to prove the theorem,

00:21:08.601 --> 00:21:15.098
to show you how simple it is.
It's extremely simple if you

00:21:15.098 --> 00:21:20.227
just use the fact that L is a
linear operator.

00:21:20.227 --> 00:21:26.611
We've got two things to prove.
What have we got to prove?

00:21:26.611 --> 00:21:32.310
Well, I have to prove two
statements, first of all,

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:39.264
that all the yp plus c1 y1 plus
c2 y2 are

00:21:39.264 --> 00:21:43.817
solutions.
How are we going to prove that?

00:21:43.817 --> 00:21:46.631
Well, how do you know if
something is a solution?

00:21:46.631 --> 00:21:49.739
Well, you plug it into the
equation, and you see if it

00:21:49.739 --> 00:21:52.143
satisfies the equation.
Good, let's do it,

00:21:52.143 --> 00:21:54.136
proof.
L, I'm going to plug it into

00:21:54.136 --> 00:21:56.657
the equation.
That means I calculate L of yp

00:21:56.657 --> 00:22:00.000
plus c1 y1 plus c2 y2.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.321
Now, what's the answer?
Because this is a linear

00:22:04.321 --> 00:22:08.827
operator, and notice,
the argument doesn't use the

00:22:08.827 --> 00:22:12.321
fact that the equation is second
order.

00:22:12.321 --> 00:22:17.839
It immediately generalizes to a
linear equation of any order,

00:22:17.839 --> 00:22:21.977
whatever-- 47.
Okay, this is L of yp plus L of

00:22:21.977 --> 00:22:25.563
c1 y1 plus c2 y2.

00:22:25.563 --> 00:22:29.885
Well, what's that?
What's L of the complementary

00:22:29.885 --> 00:22:34.032
solution?
What does it mean to be the

00:22:34.032 --> 00:22:37.797
complementary solution?
It means when you apply the

00:22:37.797 --> 00:22:40.960
operator L to it,
you get zero because this

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:43.519
satisfies the homogeneous
equation.

00:22:43.519 --> 00:22:46.682
So, this is zero.
What's L of yp?

00:22:46.682 --> 00:22:50.447
Well, it was a particular
solution to the equation.

00:22:50.447 --> 00:22:53.910
Therefore, when I plugged it
into the equation,

00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:57.298
I must have gotten out on the
right-hand side,

00:22:57.298 --> 00:23:00.385
f of x.
So, this is since yp is a

00:23:00.385 --> 00:23:06.017
solution to the whole equation.
So, what's the conclusion?

00:23:06.017 --> 00:23:10.286
That, if I take any one of
these guys, no matter what c1

00:23:10.286 --> 00:23:13.856
and c2 are, apply the linear
operator, L to it,

00:23:13.856 --> 00:23:17.116
the answer comes out
to be f of.

00:23:17.116 --> 00:23:21.462
Therefore, this proves that
this shows that these are all

00:23:21.462 --> 00:23:24.411
solutions because that's what it
means.

00:23:24.411 --> 00:23:30.000
Therefore, they satisfy L of y
equals f of x.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.189
They satisfy the whole
inhomogeneous differential

00:23:34.189 --> 00:23:38.553
equation, and that's it.
Well, that's only half the

00:23:38.553 --> 00:23:41.695
story.
The other half of the story is

00:23:41.695 --> 00:23:45.274
to show that there are no other
solutions.

00:23:45.274 --> 00:23:50.336
Okay, so we got our little u of
x coming up again,

00:23:50.336 --> 00:23:55.660
and he thinks he's a solution.
Okay, so, to prove there are no

00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:59.326
other solutions,
it almost sounds biblical,

00:23:59.326 --> 00:24:03.167
thou shalt have no other
solutions before me,

00:24:03.167 --> 00:24:07.011
okay.
There are no other solutions

00:24:07.011 --> 00:24:10.676
accept these guys for different
values of c1 and c2.

00:24:10.676 --> 00:24:13.479
Okay, so, u of x is a
solution.

00:24:13.479 --> 00:24:16.856
I have to show that u of x is
one of these guys.

00:24:16.856 --> 00:24:19.083
How am I going to do that?
Easy.

00:24:19.083 --> 00:24:21.958
If it's a solution that,
L of u,

00:24:21.958 --> 00:24:25.766
okay, I'm going to drop the x,
okay, just to make the,

00:24:25.766 --> 00:24:29.000
like I dropped the x over
there.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.768
If it's a solution to the whole
inhomogeneous equation,

00:24:33.768 --> 00:24:37.742
then this must come out to be f
of x.

00:24:37.742 --> 00:24:41.981
Now, what's L of yp?
That's f of x too,

00:24:41.981 --> 00:24:47.103
by secret little particular
solution I've got in my pocket.

00:24:47.103 --> 00:24:50.194
Okay, I pull it out,
ah-ha, L of yp,

00:24:50.194 --> 00:24:51.784
that's f of x,
too.

00:24:51.784 --> 00:24:56.906
Now, I'm going to not add them.
I'm going to subtract them.

00:24:56.906 --> 00:25:00.174
What is L of u minus yp?

00:25:00.174 --> 00:25:05.009
Well, it's zero.
It's zero because this is a

00:25:05.009 --> 00:25:08.508
linear operator.
This would be L of u minus L of

00:25:08.508 --> 00:25:12.156
yp.
I guess the answer is zero on

00:25:12.156 --> 00:25:14.687
the right-hand side.
And therefore,

00:25:14.687 --> 00:25:17.516
what is the conclusion?
If that's zero,

00:25:17.516 --> 00:25:21.163
it must be a solution to the
homogeneous equation.

00:25:21.163 --> 00:25:24.439
Therefore, u minus yp 
is equal to,

00:25:24.439 --> 00:25:28.384
there must be c1 and c2.
I won't give them the generic

00:25:28.384 --> 00:25:30.468
names.
I'll give them a name,

00:25:30.468 --> 00:25:34.995
a particular one.
I'll put a tilde to indicate

00:25:34.995 --> 00:25:37.987
it's a particular one.
c1 plus c2 y2 tilde,

00:25:37.987 --> 00:25:41.051
so, in other words,
for some choice of these

00:25:41.051 --> 00:25:45.398
constants, and I'll call those
particular choices c1 tilde and

00:25:45.398 --> 00:25:48.319
c2 tilde, it must be that these
are equal.

00:25:48.319 --> 00:25:52.167
Well, what does that say?
It says that u is equal to yp

00:25:52.167 --> 00:25:54.375
plus c1 tilde,
blah, blah, blah,

00:25:54.375 --> 00:25:57.012
blah, plus c2 tilde,
blah, blah, blah,

00:25:57.012 --> 00:26:02.000
blah, and therefore chose that
u wasn't a new solution.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:08.476
It was one of these.
So, u isn't new.

00:26:08.476 --> 00:26:18.910
So, I should write it down.
Otherwise some of you will have

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:25.746
missed the punch line.
Okay, therefore,

00:26:25.746 --> 00:26:36.000
u is equal to yp plus c1 tilde
y1 plus c2 tilde y2.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.441
And, it shows.
This guy who thought he was new

00:26:39.441 --> 00:26:43.036
was not new at all.
It was just one of the other

00:26:43.036 --> 00:26:45.025
solutions.
Okay, well, now,

00:26:45.025 --> 00:26:49.308
since the coefficient's a
constant, apparently we've done

00:26:49.308 --> 00:26:52.674
half the work.
We know what the complementary

00:26:52.674 --> 00:26:56.881
solution is because you know how
to do those in terms of

00:26:56.881 --> 00:26:59.711
exponentials and complex
exponentials,

00:26:59.711 --> 00:27:03.000
signs and cosines,
and so on.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.285
So, what's left to do?
All we have to do is find to

00:27:07.285 --> 00:27:10.714
solve equations,
which are inhomogeneous.

00:27:10.714 --> 00:27:14.742
All we have to do is find a
particular solution,

00:27:14.742 --> 00:27:18.685
find one solution.
It doesn't matter which one,

00:27:18.685 --> 00:27:20.571
any one.
Just find one,

00:27:20.571 --> 00:27:23.485
okay?
Now, we're going to spend the

00:27:23.485 --> 00:27:26.228
next two weeks trying to do
this.

00:27:26.228 --> 00:27:32.352
I'll give you various methods.
I'll give you a general method

00:27:32.352 --> 00:27:37.294
involving Fourier series because
it's a good excuse for learning

00:27:37.294 --> 00:27:41.215
what Fourier series are.
But, the answer is that in

00:27:41.215 --> 00:27:45.764
general, for a few standard
functions, it's known how to do

00:27:45.764 --> 00:27:48.352
this.
You will learn those methods

00:27:48.352 --> 00:27:50.941
for finding those using
operators.

00:27:50.941 --> 00:27:54.156
For all the others,
it's done by a series,

00:27:54.156 --> 00:27:58.000
or a method involving
approximation.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.916
Or, the worse comes to worst,
you throw it on a computer and

00:28:02.916 --> 00:28:07.500
just take a graph and the
numerical output of answers as

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:10.916
the particular solution.
Okay, now before,

00:28:10.916 --> 00:28:14.416
we are going to start that
work, not today.

00:28:14.416 --> 00:28:18.083
We'll start it next Monday,
and it will last,

00:28:18.083 --> 00:28:22.750
as I say the next two weeks.
And, we will be up to spring

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:25.166
break.
But, before we do that,

00:28:25.166 --> 00:28:30.416
I'd like to relate this to what
we did for first order equations

00:28:30.416 --> 00:28:36.000
because there is something to be
learned from that.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.840
Think back to the linear
first-order equation,

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:41.808
and I'm going to,
since from now on for the rest

00:28:41.808 --> 00:28:44.648
of the period,
I'm going to be considering the

00:28:44.648 --> 00:28:47.553
case for constant coefficients.
In other words,

00:28:47.553 --> 00:28:51.025
this case of springs or
circuits or simple systems which

00:28:51.025 --> 00:28:54.055
behave like those and have
constant coefficients.

00:28:54.055 --> 00:28:56.580
So, for the linear,
first-order equation,

00:28:56.580 --> 00:29:01.000
there, too, I'm going to think
of constant coefficients.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000
We talked quite a bit about
this equation.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.560
What did I call the right-hand
side?

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:09.780
I think we usually called it q
of t,

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:12.195
right?
This is in ancient history.

00:29:12.195 --> 00:29:16.073
The definition of ancient
history was before the first

00:29:16.073 --> 00:29:18.414
exam.
Okay, now how does that fit

00:29:18.414 --> 00:29:21.121
into this theorem that I've
given you?

00:29:21.121 --> 00:29:25.000
Remember what the solution
looked like.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.962
The solution looked like,
remember, you took the

00:29:28.962 --> 00:29:32.756
integrating factor was e to the
kt,

00:29:32.756 --> 00:29:37.815
and then after you integrated
both sides, multiplied through,

00:29:37.815 --> 00:29:41.356
and then the final answer
looked like this,

00:29:41.356 --> 00:29:45.994
y equaled, it was e to the
negative kt times

00:29:45.994 --> 00:29:50.378
either an indefinite integral,
or a definite integral

00:29:50.378 --> 00:29:54.172
depending on your preference,
q of t,

00:29:54.172 --> 00:29:58.809
so, x is metamorphosed into t.
I gather you've got that,

00:29:58.809 --> 00:30:02.266
e to the kt plus,
what was the other term?

00:30:02.266 --> 00:30:08.000
A constant times e to the
negative kt

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.258
How does this fit into the
paradigm I've given you over

00:30:12.258 --> 00:30:15.648
there for solving the second
order equation?

00:30:15.648 --> 00:30:19.433
Which term is which?
Well, this has the arbitrary

00:30:19.433 --> 00:30:22.193
constant in it.
So, this must be the

00:30:22.193 --> 00:30:24.480
complementary solution.
Is it?

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:30.000
Is this the solution to the
associated homogeneous equation?

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.698
What's the associated
homogeneous equation?

00:30:32.698 --> 00:30:35.396
Put zero here.
Okay, if you put zero there,

00:30:35.396 --> 00:30:38.479
what's the solution?
Now, this you ought to know.

00:30:38.479 --> 00:30:40.985
y prime equals negative ky.

00:30:40.985 --> 00:30:43.554
What's the solution?
e to the negative kt.

00:30:43.554 --> 00:30:46.188
You are supposed to come into

00:30:46.188 --> 00:30:49.528
this course knowing that,
except there's an arbitrary

00:30:49.528 --> 00:30:52.612
constant in front.
So, right, this is exactly the

00:30:52.612 --> 00:30:55.631
solution to the associated
homogeneous equation,

00:30:55.631 --> 00:31:00.000
where there is zero here.
Then, what's this thing?

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.743
This is a particular solution.
This is my yp.

00:31:02.743 --> 00:31:06.423
But that's not a particular
solution because this indefinite

00:31:06.423 --> 00:31:09.354
integral, you know,
has an arbitrary constant in

00:31:09.354 --> 00:31:10.975
it.
In fact, it's just that

00:31:10.975 --> 00:31:13.844
arbitrary constant.
So, it's totally confusing.

00:31:13.844 --> 00:31:16.525
But, this symbol,
you know when you actually

00:31:16.525 --> 00:31:20.080
solve the equation this way,
all you did was you found one

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:22.387
function here.
You didn't throw in the

00:31:22.387 --> 00:31:26.066
arbitrary constant right away.
All you needed to do was find

00:31:26.066 --> 00:31:29.788
one function.
And, even if you really are

00:31:29.788 --> 00:31:32.900
bothered by the fact that this
is so indefinite,

00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:35.748
and therefore,
make it a particular solution

00:31:35.748 --> 00:31:38.927
by making this zero,
make it a definite integral,

00:31:38.927 --> 00:31:42.105
zero, here, t there,
and then change those t's to

00:31:42.105 --> 00:31:45.483
dummy t's, t1's or t tildes,
or something like that.

00:31:45.483 --> 00:31:48.463
So, this fits into that thing.
In other words,

00:31:48.463 --> 00:31:52.172
I could have done it at that
time, but I didn't the point

00:31:52.172 --> 00:31:55.086
because this can be solved
directly, whereas,

00:31:55.086 --> 00:31:58.927
of course, the general second
order equation in homogeneous

00:31:58.927 --> 00:32:02.503
cannot be solved directly,
and therefore you have to be

00:32:02.503 --> 00:32:08.000
willing to talk about what its
solutions look like in advance.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.071
Now, remember I said,
we talked, I said there was two

00:32:12.071 --> 00:32:15.594
different cases,
although both of them had the

00:32:15.594 --> 00:32:19.978
identical looking solution.
Their meaning in the physical

00:32:19.978 --> 00:32:24.832
world was so different that they
really should be considered as

00:32:24.832 --> 00:32:30.000
solving the same equation.
And, one of these was the case.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.692
Of the two, perhaps the more
important was the case when k

00:32:34.692 --> 00:32:38.314
was positive,
and of course the other is when

00:32:38.314 --> 00:32:41.031
k is negative.
When k is positive,

00:32:41.031 --> 00:32:45.230
that had the effect of
separating that solution into

00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:49.510
this part, which was a
transient, and the other part,

00:32:49.510 --> 00:32:53.709
which was a steady state.
The steady state solution,

00:32:53.709 --> 00:32:57.496
that was the yp part of it in
that terminology.

00:32:57.496 --> 00:33:02.024
And, the transient part,
it was trangent because it went

00:33:02.024 --> 00:33:05.558
to zero.
If k is positive,

00:33:05.558 --> 00:33:09.593
the exponential dies regardless
of what c is.

00:33:09.593 --> 00:33:12.985
So, the transient,
that's the yc part.

00:33:12.985 --> 00:33:16.378
It goes to zero as Ttgoes to
infinity.

00:33:16.378 --> 00:33:21.237
The transient depends on,
uses, the initial condition,

00:33:21.237 --> 00:33:25.363
whatever it is,
because that's what determines

00:33:25.363 --> 00:33:28.389
the value of c.
On the other hand,

00:33:28.389 --> 00:33:33.799
this initial condition makes no
difference as t goes towards

00:33:33.799 --> 00:33:38.788
infinity.
All that's left is this steady

00:33:38.788 --> 00:33:42.971
state solution.
And, all solutions tend to the

00:33:42.971 --> 00:33:46.967
steady state solution.
So, if k is positive,

00:33:46.967 --> 00:33:52.358
one gets this analysis of the
solutions into the sum of one

00:33:52.358 --> 00:33:55.147
basic solution,
and the others,

00:33:55.147 --> 00:33:59.423
which just die away,
have no influence on this,

00:33:59.423 --> 00:34:05.000
less and less influence as time
goes to infinity.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.160
For k less than zero,
this analysis does not work

00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:12.715
because this term,
if k is less than zero,

00:34:12.715 --> 00:34:16.789
this term goes to infinity or
negative infinity,

00:34:16.789 --> 00:34:19.910
and typically tends to dominate
that.

00:34:19.910 --> 00:34:23.464
So, it's the start that the
important one.

00:34:23.464 --> 00:34:28.318
It depends on the initial
conditions, and the analysis is

00:34:28.318 --> 00:34:33.000
meaningless.
So, the above is meaningless.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:39.570
And now, what I'd like to do is
try to see what the analog of

00:34:39.570 --> 00:34:45.155
that is for second order
equations, and higher order

00:34:45.155 --> 00:34:49.645
equations.
If you understand second-order,

00:34:49.645 --> 00:34:54.902
that's good enough.
Higher order goes exactly the

00:34:54.902 --> 00:34:58.077
same way.
So, the question is,

00:34:58.077 --> 00:35:02.896
for second-order,
let's make it with constant

00:35:02.896 --> 00:35:07.495
coefficients plus,
I could call it b and k,

00:35:07.495 --> 00:35:11.000
oh, no, b k,
or p.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.292
The trouble is,
that wouldn't take care of the

00:35:14.292 --> 00:35:17.951
electrical circuits.
So, I just want to use neutral

00:35:17.951 --> 00:35:22.414
letters, which suggest nothing.
And, you can make them turn it

00:35:22.414 --> 00:35:25.268
into a circuit,
so springs, or yet other

00:35:25.268 --> 00:35:28.560
examples undreamt of.
But these are constants.

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:32.000
And I'm going to think of it as
time.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:37.300
I think I'll switch back to
time, let x be the time.

00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:43.224
So, B y equals f of t.
So, there is our equation.

00:35:43.224 --> 00:35:47.693
A and B are constants.
And, the question is,

00:35:47.693 --> 00:35:53.098
the question I'm asking,
can think of either of these

00:35:53.098 --> 00:35:58.087
two models or others,
the question I'm asking is,

00:35:58.087 --> 00:36:04.426
under what circumstances can I
make that same type of analysis

00:36:04.426 --> 00:36:11.750
into steady-state and transient?
Well, what does the solution

00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:15.187
look like?
The solution looks like y

00:36:15.187 --> 00:36:20.687
equals a particular solution
plus c1 y1 plus c2 y2.

00:36:20.687 --> 00:36:24.812
Therefore, to make that look

00:36:24.812 --> 00:36:31.000
like this, the c1 and c2 contain
the initial conditions.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.815
This part does not.
Therefore, if I want to say

00:36:35.815 --> 00:36:41.678
that the solutions look like a
steady state solution plus

00:36:41.678 --> 00:36:47.122
something that dies away,
which becomes less and less

00:36:47.122 --> 00:36:52.566
important as time goes on,
what I'm really asking is,

00:36:52.566 --> 00:36:58.429
under what circumstances is
this part guaranteed to go to

00:36:58.429 --> 00:37:01.960
zero?
So, the question is,

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:06.764
when, in other words,
under what conditions on the

00:37:06.764 --> 00:37:10.882
equation A and B,
in effect, is what we are

00:37:10.882 --> 00:37:14.411
asking.
When does c1 y1 plus c2 y2 go

00:37:14.411 --> 00:37:19.901
to zero as t goes to infinity,

00:37:19.901 --> 00:37:25.588
regardless of what
c1 and c2 are for all c1 c2.

00:37:25.588 --> 00:37:30.000
Now, here there was no
difficulty.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.019
We had the thing very
explicitly, and you could see k

00:37:34.019 --> 00:37:38.039
is positive: this goes to zero.
And if k is negative,

00:37:38.039 --> 00:37:41.286
it doesn't go to zero.
It goes to infinity.

00:37:41.286 --> 00:37:44.842
Here, I want to make the same
kind of analysis,

00:37:44.842 --> 00:37:49.325
except it's just going to take,
it's a little more trouble.

00:37:49.325 --> 00:37:52.649
But the answer,
when it finally comes out is

00:37:52.649 --> 00:37:55.896
very beautiful.
So, when are all these guys

00:37:55.896 --> 00:37:58.447
going to go to zero?
First of all,

00:37:58.447 --> 00:38:01.694
you might as well just have the
definition.

00:38:01.694 --> 00:38:05.636
So, all the good things that
this is going to imply,

00:38:05.636 --> 00:38:07.878
if this is so,
in other words,

00:38:07.878 --> 00:38:12.052
if they all go to zero,
everything in the complementary

00:38:12.052 --> 00:38:17.000
solution, then the ODE is called
stable.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.961
Some people call it
asymptotically stable.

00:38:21.961 --> 00:38:28.375
I don't know what to call it.
I can make the analysis,

00:38:28.375 --> 00:38:36.000
and then I use the identical
terminology, c1 y1 plus c2 y2.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.244
This is called the transient
because it goes to zero.

00:38:40.244 --> 00:38:45.142
This is called the particular
solution now that we labored so

00:38:45.142 --> 00:38:47.918
hard to get for the next two
weeks.

00:38:47.918 --> 00:38:52.081
It's the important part.
It's the steady-state part.

00:38:52.081 --> 00:38:56.653
It's what lasts out to infinity
after the other stuff has

00:38:56.653 --> 00:38:59.918
disappeared.
So, this is the steady-state

00:38:59.918 --> 00:39:04.000
solution, steady-state solution,
okay?

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:07.174
And, the differential equation
is called stable.

00:39:07.174 --> 00:39:10.348
Now, it's of the highest
interest to know when a

00:39:10.348 --> 00:39:14.602
differential equation is stable,
linear differential equation is

00:39:14.602 --> 00:39:17.776
stable in this sense because you
have a control.

00:39:17.776 --> 00:39:20.275
You know what its solutions
look like.

00:39:20.275 --> 00:39:24.327
You have some feeling for how
it's behaving in the long term.

00:39:24.327 --> 00:39:27.366
If this is not so,
each equation is a law unto

00:39:27.366 --> 00:39:31.826
itself if you don't know.
So, let's do the work.

00:39:31.826 --> 00:39:36.560
For the rest of the period,
what I'd like to do is to find

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:40.629
out what the conditions are,
which make this true.

00:39:40.629 --> 00:39:45.446
Those were the equations which
we will have a right to call

00:39:45.446 --> 00:39:48.186
stable.
So, when does this happen,

00:39:48.186 --> 00:39:50.761
and where is it going to
happen?

00:39:50.761 --> 00:39:54.000
I don't know.
I guess, here.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:10.070
Now, I think the first step is
fairly easy, and it will give

00:40:10.070 --> 00:40:14.796
you a good review of what we've
been doing up until now.

00:40:14.796 --> 00:40:19.265
So, I'm simply going to make a
case-by-case analysis.

00:40:19.265 --> 00:40:22.359
Don't worry,
it won't take very long.

00:40:22.359 --> 00:40:25.625
What are the cases we've been
studying?

00:40:25.625 --> 00:40:29.750
Well, what do the
characteristic roots look like?

00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:34.562
The roots of the characteristic
equation, in other words,

00:40:34.562 --> 00:40:41.557
remember, there are cases.
The first case is they are real

00:40:41.557 --> 00:40:45.229
and distinct,
r1 not equal to r2,

00:40:45.229 --> 00:40:50.163
real and distinct.
What are the other cases?

00:40:50.163 --> 00:40:56.704
Well, r1 equals r2.
And then, there's the case

00:40:56.704 --> 00:41:02.901
where there are complex.
So, I will write it r equals a

00:41:02.901 --> 00:41:07.673
plus or minus b i.
What do the solutions look

00:41:07.673 --> 00:41:09.862
like?
So, my ham-handed approach to

00:41:09.862 --> 00:41:12.501
this problem is going to be,
in each case,

00:41:12.501 --> 00:41:16.170
I'll look at the solutions,
and first get the condition on

00:41:16.170 --> 00:41:18.036
the roots.
So, in other words,

00:41:18.036 --> 00:41:21.577
I'm not going to worry right
away about the a and the b.

00:41:21.577 --> 00:41:24.731
I'm going, instead,
to worry about expressing this

00:41:24.731 --> 00:41:28.528
condition of stability in terms
of the characteristic roots.

00:41:28.528 --> 00:41:32.197
In fact, that's the only way in
which many people know the

00:41:32.197 --> 00:41:35.913
conditions.
You're going to be smarter.

00:41:35.913 --> 00:41:38.535
Okay, what do the solutions
look like?

00:41:38.535 --> 00:41:42.645
Well, the general solution
looks like e to the r1 t plus c2

00:41:42.645 --> 00:41:45.480
e to the r2 t.

00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:48.314
Okay, so, what's the stability
condition?

00:41:48.314 --> 00:41:51.362
In other words,
if equation happened to have

00:41:51.362 --> 00:41:54.409
its characteristic roots,
real and distinct,

00:41:54.409 --> 00:41:57.456
under what circumstances would
it be stable?

00:41:57.456 --> 00:42:01.283
Would it, in other words,
all its solutions go to zero?

00:42:01.283 --> 00:42:04.543
So, I'm talking about the
homogeneous equation,

00:42:04.543 --> 00:42:07.874
the reduced equation,
the associated homogeneous

00:42:07.874 --> 00:42:10.291
equation.
Why?

00:42:10.291 --> 00:42:13.348
Because that's all that's
involved in this.

00:42:13.348 --> 00:42:15.750
In other words,
when I write that,

00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:19.172
I am no longer interested in
the whole equation.

00:42:19.172 --> 00:42:22.448
All I'm interested in is the
reduced equation,

00:42:22.448 --> 00:42:26.306
the equation where you turn the
f of t on the

00:42:26.306 --> 00:42:31.529
right-hand side into zero.
So, what's the stability

00:42:31.529 --> 00:42:35.219
condition?
Well, let's write it out.

00:42:35.219 --> 00:42:41.017
Under what circumstances will
all these guys go to zero?

00:42:41.017 --> 00:42:46.182
If r1 and r2 should be
negative, can they be zero?

00:42:46.182 --> 00:42:52.612
No, because then it will be a
constant and it will go to zero.

00:42:52.612 --> 00:42:56.512
How about this one?
Well, in this one,

00:42:56.512 --> 00:43:01.994
it's (c1 plus c2 times t)
multiplied by e to the r1 t.

00:43:01.994 --> 00:43:08.159
Of course, both of these are

00:43:08.159 --> 00:43:11.168
the same.
I'll just arbitrarily pick one

00:43:11.168 --> 00:43:14.099
of them.
What happens to this as things

00:43:14.099 --> 00:43:16.954
go to zero?
Well, this part is rising,

00:43:16.954 --> 00:43:21.351
at least if c2 is positive.
This part is either helping or

00:43:21.351 --> 00:43:24.900
it's hindering.
But, I hope you know what these

00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:28.679
functions look like,
and you know which of them go

00:43:28.679 --> 00:43:31.148
to zero.
They go to zero if r1 is

00:43:31.148 --> 00:43:35.948
negative.
It might rise in the beginning,

00:43:35.948 --> 00:43:39.561
but after a while they lose the
energy.

00:43:39.561 --> 00:43:44.887
Of course, if r1 is equal to
zero, what do these guys do?

00:43:44.887 --> 00:43:49.357
Linear, go to infinity.
Well, we are doing okay.

00:43:49.357 --> 00:43:53.636
How about here?
Well, here, it's a little more

00:43:53.636 --> 00:43:57.440
complicated.
The solutions look like e to

00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:03.337
the at times (c1 cosine bt plus
c2 sine bt).

00:44:03.337 --> 00:44:07.828
Now, this part is a pure

00:44:07.828 --> 00:44:09.809
oscillation.
You know that.

00:44:09.809 --> 00:44:13.695
It might have a big amplitude,
but whatever it does,

00:44:13.695 --> 00:44:16.361
it does the same thing all the
time.

00:44:16.361 --> 00:44:20.933
So, whether this goes to zero
depends entirely upon what that

00:44:20.933 --> 00:44:24.742
exponential is doing.
And, that exponential goes to

00:44:24.742 --> 00:44:28.323
zero if a is negative.
So here, the condition is

00:44:28.323 --> 00:44:33.677
negative.
And now, the only thing left to

00:44:33.677 --> 00:44:38.898
do is to say it nicely.
I've got three cases,

00:44:38.898 --> 00:44:43.644
and I want to say them all in
one breath.

00:44:43.644 --> 00:44:49.457
So, the stability condition is,
the ODE is stable.

00:44:49.457 --> 00:44:53.135
So, this is,
or f of t.

00:44:53.135 --> 00:44:57.762
It doesn't matter.
But, psychologically,

00:44:57.762 --> 00:45:05.000
you can put this as zero there,
is stable if what?

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.764
In case one,
this is true.

00:45:07.764 --> 00:45:10.418
In case two,
that's true.

00:45:10.418 --> 00:45:13.293
In case three,
that's true.

00:45:13.293 --> 00:45:17.052
But that's ugly.
Make it beautiful.

00:45:17.052 --> 00:45:23.466
The beautiful way of saying it
is if all the characteristic

00:45:23.466 --> 00:45:31.227
roots have negative real parts.
If the characteristic roots,

00:45:31.227 --> 00:45:38.027
the r's or the a plus or minus
b i, have negative real part.

00:45:38.027 --> 00:45:44.596
That's the form in which the
electrical engineers will nod

00:45:44.596 --> 00:45:49.206
their head, tell you,
yeah, that's right,

00:45:49.206 --> 00:45:52.088
negative real part,
sorry.

00:45:52.088 --> 00:45:56.006
Isn't it right?
Is that right here?

00:45:56.006 --> 00:45:59.925
Yeah.
What's the real part of these

00:45:59.925 --> 00:46:03.836
guys?
They themselves,

00:46:03.836 --> 00:46:09.691
because they are real.
What's the real part of this?

00:46:09.691 --> 00:46:13.824
Yeah.
The only case in which I really

00:46:13.824 --> 00:46:20.367
had to use real part is when I
talk about the complex case

00:46:20.367 --> 00:46:26.222
because a is just the real part
of a complex number.

00:46:26.222 --> 00:46:27.888
It's not the whole thing.
