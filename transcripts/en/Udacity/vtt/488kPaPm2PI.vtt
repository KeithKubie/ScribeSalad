00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.190
We now know a great deal about all three class patterns,

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:06.410
functional, prototypal and pseudo-classical.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.930
Let's move on to

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.450
thinking about the slightly more advanced code-sharing technique of subclassing.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.490
After that, we'll explore how we could achieve these same goals using

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:15.540
a pseudo-classical pattern.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.660
Note that the pseudo-classical pattern is a lot more widely documented on

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.340
the internet than the functional pattern that we're about to explore here.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.140
So, external resources may be confusing until after you've

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.990
completed the section after this one.
