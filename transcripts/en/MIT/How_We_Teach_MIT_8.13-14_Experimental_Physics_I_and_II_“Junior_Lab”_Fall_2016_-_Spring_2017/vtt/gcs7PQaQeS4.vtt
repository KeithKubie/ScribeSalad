CHRISTINA WANG: So advice
about time management.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.750
I think, like, for the
first experiment I did--

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.940
it was a 21-centimeter
astrophysics experiment--

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.100
that took a really long time.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.800
So I basically spent the
entire weekend on the analysis.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.370
So, like, after
that, I thought I

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:33.050
should read about how to do
analysis, like, beforehand.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.120
I guess try to do everything
beforehand because whatever

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.780
you plan out it will
only be like slower

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.682
than what you plan out.

00:00:43.682 --> 00:00:45.890
It will never be faster than
what you've planned out.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.240
So I try to do everything as
soon as possible and just don't

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.620
procrastinate, I guess.
