00:00:00.734 --> 00:00:03.903
(commanding music)

00:00:03.903 --> 00:00:06.840
- The police in Florida are
literally using pictures

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.309
of young black men as targets.

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:13.246
Now, how can we see that and
be surprised when it happens

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:14.481
in real life?

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:16.483 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'm not surprised when
Kobe hits a jumper.

00:00:16.483 --> 00:00:18.251
That dude practices.

00:00:18.251 --> 00:00:20.787
- You don't go to a rally
to beat cancer and say,

00:00:20.787 --> 00:00:23.123 align:start size:84% position:16%
"Well, you know, all
diseases matter."

00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:24.624
You know what I'm saying?

00:00:24.624 --> 00:00:25.959
(laughter)

00:00:25.959 --> 00:00:27.293
In the same instance.

00:00:27.293 --> 00:00:28.528
You know what I'm saying?

00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:29.863
- Well, it wouldn't
be a bad message.

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:31.131
- Yeah, it wouldn't.

00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:32.399
I mean technically,
yeah, you're right,

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.700
but we're not here for that.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.268
- All diseases do kinda matter.

00:00:35.268 --> 00:00:36.436
- They do kinda matter.

00:00:36.436 --> 00:00:37.270
- Your wife is black, right?

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:38.104
- Yes.

00:00:38.104 --> 00:00:39.639
- You were saying.

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:41.775
Now, if you had to choose
the race of your child-

00:00:41.775 --> 00:00:43.009
(laughter)

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:44.577
- Hold on, hold on.

00:00:44.577 --> 00:00:47.180
No, no, no. No wait. Let me ...

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.815
I don't buy this biracial ...

00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:53.086
Your child is either
black or white, okay?

00:00:53.086 --> 00:00:55.321
- After listening to those
stats, white all the way.

00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:56.156
(laughter)

00:00:56.156 --> 00:00:57.924
Thank you. Thank you.
