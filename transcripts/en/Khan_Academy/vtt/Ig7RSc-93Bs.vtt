00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.280
The Statue of Liberty,
pictured above,

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.120
is a gigantic sculpture
located on Liberty Island

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.250
in New York, United States.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.430
The height of the
sculpture is 151 feet.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.420
So this distance right
over here is 151 feet.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.860
So it's like a 15 story
building or more, or about a 15

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:18.840
story building.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.690
The distance from the
ground to the torch is 305.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.910
So from here to
there is 305 feet.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.330
What is the absolute
value of the difference

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.620
between 305 and 151?

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:36.054
Well we just have to
subtract 151 from 305.

00:00:36.054 --> 00:00:37.970
And you might be able
to do that on your head.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.210
Let's see, if you add 150
to 151, you get to 301.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.864
So then you have to add
another 4, so it's 154.

00:00:44.864 --> 00:00:46.780
Or you could use a
calculator right over here.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:58.010
You could say 305 minus
151 is equal to 154,

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.590
which is what we
did in our head.

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.374
And the absolute
value of 154-- there's

00:01:02.374 --> 00:01:04.040
a couple of ways you
can think about it.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.498
You could learn to
just view it as,

00:01:05.498 --> 00:01:07.090
how far is that number from 0?

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.330
And positive 154
is 154 away from 0.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.870
If this was negative
154 then that also

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.942
would be 154 away from 0.

00:01:15.942 --> 00:01:17.400
The other way to
think about it is,

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.820
whether it's
positive or negative,

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.240
the absolute value,
you just take

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.670
the positive version of it.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.310
So either way we say 154.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.680
Let's do a couple more of these.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:31.990
I like these pictures.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.670
The average weight of a
car in the United States

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.670
is roughly 4,000 pounds.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.780
The dinosaur Ankylosaurus--
artist rendering above--

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.710
is thought to have weighed
up to 13,000 pounds.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.700
What is the absolute
value of the difference

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.967
between these two weights?

00:01:45.967 --> 00:01:48.300
And you could calculate the
difference between these two

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.860
weights.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.880
You could take the smaller
and subtract from the larger.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.290
So if you take
4,000 from 13,000,

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.400
the difference would
be 9,000 pounds.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.714
The absolute value
of 9,000 is 9,000.

00:01:58.714 --> 00:02:00.130
You could have
gone the other way.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.090
You could've subtracted
13,000 from 4,000,

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.230
and you would have
gotten negative 9,000.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.430
But the absolute value of
negative 9,000 is still 9,000.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.960
So we just want to think
about the absolute difference

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:10.727
between these two.

00:02:10.727 --> 00:02:12.310
We don't want to
think about which one

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.940
we're subtracting
from whichever one.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.856
Whatever we're subtracting
from the other one,

00:02:15.856 --> 00:02:17.870
we just find the
absolute difference.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.155
So whether the difference
was negative 9,000 or 9,000,

00:02:21.155 --> 00:02:23.280
depending on which one you
subtract from the other,

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.970
the absolute value
of either of those

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.160
is going to be 9,000 pounds.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.280
Let's do one more.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.610
No picture this time.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.010
I was getting used to that.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.917
The Panama Canal
is a canal cutting

00:02:35.917 --> 00:02:38.250
through the country of Panama
that conveniently connects

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.570
the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.028
What's nice about
these is we learn

00:02:41.028 --> 00:02:42.850
other things other
than mathematics here.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.940
France began constructing
the canal in the year 1881

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.060
and, after the French
abandoned construction,

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.460
the United States finished
construction in 1914.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.780
What is the absolute value of
the difference between the year

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.670
construction of the
Panama Canal started

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.350
and the year that it ended?

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.250
Well, there's a couple
ways you could do it.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.750
You could take the larger year
and subtract the smaller year

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:06.700
from it.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.330
We have our calculator here.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:14.070
You could literally
say 1914 minus 1881,

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.470
and you get 33 years.

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.156
And the absolute value
of 33 is just 33.

00:03:20.156 --> 00:03:22.030
Or you could've done it
the other way around.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.005
Since we're taking
absolute value,

00:03:23.005 --> 00:03:25.500
it doesn't matter what we
subtract from the other ones.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.025
You could do on 1881
minus 1914, and you

00:03:30.025 --> 00:03:33.760
would've gotten negative 33.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.260
But the absolute value of
either of these numbers

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.180
is, you're saying, how far
is 33 or negative 33 from 0?

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.759
Well, they're both
33 away from zero.

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:43.300
Or you could say, well, what's
the positive version of either

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.800
of these?

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:44.880
Well, it's 33.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.310
So the absolute value of
the difference in the years

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.070
is 33 years.

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.850
And we're done.
