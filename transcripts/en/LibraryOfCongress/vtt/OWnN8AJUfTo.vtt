Congress in Washington DC.

[ Inaudible Speech ]

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.750
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Good
evening everybody.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.480
It's very nice to see all of
you here ready for this concert.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.110
My name is David Plyler.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.410
I'm in the music division,
and I have the great honor

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.490
and pleasure to have
three amazing musicians

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:31.790
up here with me.

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:33.690
At the end, we have
Elliott Fisk,

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.250
who you will hear on a guitar.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.900
Irvine Arditti, founder
and patriarch, I guess,

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.490
of the Arditti Quartet,
and Hilda Paredes,

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.370
whose work we will hear
premiered this evening.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.670
So welcome.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:49.970
We're so pleased to have you.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.270
&gt;&gt; Eliot Fisk: Thank you.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.070
&gt;&gt; Hilda Paredes: Thank
you for having us.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.210
[ Applause ]

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.570
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: At the very
outset, before we get started,

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.330
I want to thank the
Mexican Cultural Institute

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.610
of the Embassy of Mexico
for their support in helping

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.520
to bring Hilda here today, so
that she could speak with us

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.080
and experience the
performance, as well.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.830
I thought -- there's
such a variety of music

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.480
on this program, I thought
we could just say a few words

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.030
about each piece and kind
of go from there and see

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.310
where the conversation takes us.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.770
So I thought maybe the place
to start would be the Berio.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.520
There will be an admission,
of sorts, of a fault of mine

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.820
with this piece, but --

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.970
&gt;&gt; Eliot Fisk: It's
not your fault.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.630
You know, it's always
interesting when things

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.680
that you've lived become lines
in some kind of an encyclopedia

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.250
or somebody's treatise or
somebody's PhD dissertation

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.550
or whatever, you know?

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.700
And you remember how you lived
it, and then you see how the,

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.540
you know, the musicological
mind deals with what you lived

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.980
and what you experienced
as music, and sometimes,

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.930
it's quite brilliant what they
have to say, and sometimes,

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.890
they just get it a little wrong.

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.100
I think this case it's
curious that, in my experience,

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.300
what the man wrote
was incorrect.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.380
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: So what
I'm just going to point out,

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.630
and I like to -- if I'm
wrong about something,

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.200
I want to put it out
there right away.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.880
There's a, in your notes, it's
since been updated, by the way,

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.020
in the digital version, in
your notes there is a mistake

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.930
about one of the things that
Eliot Fisk supposedly said

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:38.720
to Berio, and I made the
incorrect approach of going

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.150
with the secondary source,

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.360
when the primary
source is right there.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.080
So this is a good -- this is a
teachable moment with research.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.550
So be aware.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:47.850
&gt;&gt; Eliot Fisk: It's
really just -- it's just --

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.010
&gt;&gt; Irvine Arditti: What
are you talking about?

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.480
&gt;&gt; Eliot Fisk: So
almost 30 years ago,

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:59.630
I met Berio in his villa in the
Radicondoli, the famous place

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.940
where he wrote a lot of his
music and where he retreated

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.220
from the world and just
holed up and wrote things

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.920
and had wonderful, big dinner
banquets and things with lots

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.470
of people, and it was
a wonderful place.

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.620
Basically, it was
similar to Stockhausen.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.450
If you want to write
these people,

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.750
you write Maestro Luciano
Berio Radicondoli Italia

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.050
vicinoa Siena.

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:21.350
So you write, you know,

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:22.650
Radicondoli is the
name of the town.

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:23.950
Near to Siena.

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.250
So you write, you
know, Radicondoli,

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.550
it's the name of the town.

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:27.850
Italia, that's Italy.

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.150
Near to Siena, that's
the address.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.450
Like Stockhausen used to
be Stockhausen Kurten,

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.750
whatever the [inaudible]
was, right?

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.050
It was Stockhausen Kurten.

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:34.600
That's all you need for
these to get to these people.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.900
Anyway --

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.890
&gt;&gt; Irvine Arditti: It's not
good if you live in London.

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.840
&gt;&gt; Eliot Fisk: Then you just
write [non-English word].

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.780
It gets there.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.970
But anyway, so, as we
work towards the creation

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.030
of a sequenti, it's, perhaps,
not a typical process,

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.540
because these sequenzas were
written, really, almost,

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.550
at least in my case, almost as a
kind of a portrait of the lunacy

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.450
of the person for which
the piece was written,

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.100
and I remember when I got
the first draft of it,

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.400
and he writes [non-English
spoken].

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.700
"Here it is.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.000
The cursed one.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.020
It will make you despair
as it has made me despair."

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.500
Anyway, so he wrote, as
you'll hear, there's a short,

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.120
quiet introduction, which
was actually added later

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.600
at breakfast one morning.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.850
But the short introduction was
added later, but the piece,

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.590
it originally started with just

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.600
like two chords and
an explosion.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.220
Later, he had a little
bit of an intro

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.550
to make the explosion a little
bit -- come a little bit later.

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.640
But anyway, he figured
that after about 12 minutes

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.350
of just going crazy
on the instrument,

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.660
that the instrument
would be out of tune,

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.830
which was a logical
assumption, but in fact,

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.470
it really didn't get out
of tune most of the time.

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.390
And so, there's this optional
place about 10 pages in,

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.680
where if you want, you can tune
the instrument, and you'll hear

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.980
that there's this sort of place
where things relax for a while.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.400
You can tune the instrument.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.710
Will tonight, since the second
piece has got all scordatura,

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.010
meaning change.

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.750
Maestro Berio's piece
has lots of changing

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.290
of the tuning of
the instruments.

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.980
So maybe tonight it will be the
one night that I have to tune,

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.310
but I generally don't
tune, and that was --

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.920
it was not me that said
anything about having to tune.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.220
That was Berio's idea.

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.320
So that's the slight
incorrection that --

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.010
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: So the
reason I bring this up,

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.560
beyond it just being kind
of interesting in itself is

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.810
that the interactions between
composers when they're able

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.810
to work the instrumentalists

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.270
who are performing
their works is really --

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.430
it plays a great role in the
creation of these pieces.

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.550
And so, for all of the
pieces, I believe tonight,

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.410
there was some aspect of this
where the performers were able

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:44.100
to work with the composers,
or not with the Lachenmann or?

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.400
&gt;&gt; Irvine Arditti:
You said everything.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.330
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Oh, okay.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:53.200
So in any case, it's just one of
those important things that --

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.790
well, one other thing I'd
like to say, or have you speak

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:59.840
about with the sequenza, you
mentioned earlier today that,

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.140
in many ways, these
are like portraits,

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:09.560
not so much about any particular
theoretical or technical aspect,

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.700
but it's more portraits
of performers and things.

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:16.850
So this aspect of
performer/composer kind

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:20.130
of struck you as that
was being an important --

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:21.430
&gt;&gt; Eliot Fisk: Yeah,
I don't want

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:23.620
to overemphasize my
personal importance.

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.420
Of course, there are all
kinds of musical structures

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:27.890
that are being worked
out, and Berio's composing

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:31.200
out the musical DNA, really,
of a certain chord that's

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.500
in the piece, and
that's what, you know,

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:33.850
the great composers do.

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:37.450
They compose out the musical --
they establish a musical DNA,

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:40.610
and they compose out
some of the many ways

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:44.130
that DNA might be developed,
as it goes through life,

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:48.180
so to speak, and that's really
more important than my persona,

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:51.440
as far as the piece, of
much more importance.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.310
It just so happened I
had the privilege to work

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:55.870
with Maestro Berio
on this piece,

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:57.760
and we did have a lot
of back-and-forth.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.060
There were a lot of little --

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:00.840
you know, he really knew
the instrument very well,

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.010
and actually, you
know, showed me,

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:09.140
as Maestro Paredes actually
has given me a very profound

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:10.440
education about my instrument.

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:11.740
She found all these things

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.360
that I thought were
completely impossible.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.660
I still think they're
impossible,

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:15.960
but she's actually
right, you know?

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.260
I just have to work harder.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:18.820
[ Laughter ]

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.120
So this is a great
thing, when you work

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.970
with a superior musical mind

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:25.510
that doesn't necessarily
play your instrument.

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:28.800
They don't tend to have
a lot of pity on you,

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.050
and but this is good,
because it forces you to grow

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:35.930
and to expand your horizons and
to amplify your consciousness,

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:38.790
and this is why we're
grateful, especially tonight,

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:41.240
to have the honor of
Maestro here with us.

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.050
It's terrific.

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:44.350
So...

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:45.650
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Well,
writing for guitar,

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:46.950
if you're a non-guitarist,
I think it's one

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:48.620
of those tricky things
for composers, in general,

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:51.550
but you've written a lot of
pieces that involve guitar

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:53.040
or pluck strings and
things like that.

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.540
Maybe you can tell us a bit

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:56.730
about this piece,
this new piece.

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:58.030
&gt;&gt; Hilda Paredes: The
guitar is a big challenge,

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:00.900
if you're not a guitarist
yourself,

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:05.650
but then I don't play violin.

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:06.950
I don't play viola.

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:09.900
I don't play cello, and just,
as you've mentioned before,

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:15.110
working, it is as important for
composer to work with players,

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:18.390
as it is for players
to work for composers.

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:25.730
And we develop all sorts of ways
of understanding the instrument,

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:29.810
and in my case, I tried to
write very idiomatically

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:35.450
and to discover, to draw the
music out of the instrument,

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:42.120
but also, to try to find -- you
see, the more I write music,

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:47.830
the more I discover that music
has its own intelligence,

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:53.300
and the less I have to make
decisions, the more the process

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:56.790
of creation is, for me,
a process of discovery

00:08:56.790 --> 00:09:00.930
and a process that sometimes
it's very surprising.

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:06.370
So, I will mention score Datura,
but this has been an issue

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:09.050
that we have been discussing,
and because you mentioned it.

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:10.650
&gt;&gt; Irvine Arditti: That's
why I'm sitting between them.

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:12.000
&gt;&gt; Hilda Paredes: Yes.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.040
[ Laughter ]

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:22.040
The guitar is tuned, the strings
of the guitar are tuned to a way

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:28.020
of thinking, which is
very tonal, very much part

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:32.180
of a harmony that is --
belongs to a certain period

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:35.920
in the history of music,
and for me, the difference

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:39.630
between the guitar and the bowed
instruments in a string quartet,

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:44.980
is precisely that it's a lot
easier to change the tuning.

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:48.760
I never like to change the
tuning of the bowed instruments,

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:50.060
because it creates all sorts

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.760
of practical problems
to get the pieces --

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.060
&gt;&gt; Eliot Fisk: There's
no problem at all

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:55.910
when you retune three
strings of the guitar.

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:58.390
It's very, very easy.

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:01.410
&gt;&gt; Hilda Paredes: Well, perhaps,
you have to think differently,

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:06.750
but the guitar can
take it more easily.

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:13.190
And this, for me, creates
a whole different range

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:14.880
of harmonic possibilities.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.180
&gt;&gt; Eliot Fisk: Yeah,
this is for sure.

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:17.480
It is amazing.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:20.910
&gt;&gt; Hilda Paredes: Yes, and
this is, for me, the source --

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:25.830
all the harmonic structure
of the piece is in the hands

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:30.390
of the guitar, in the way the
guitar is tuned differently

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:33.620
in this piece.

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:34.920
Yeah.

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:36.220
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Does
the tunings stay --

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:38.250
does it change during
the course of the piece?

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:39.720
&gt;&gt; Eliot Fisk: No, that's --

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.020
&gt;&gt; Hilda Paredes: No.

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:42.320
&gt;&gt; Eliot Fisk: At
least that, but --

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:43.620
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: The next piece.

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:45.830
&gt;&gt; Eliot Fisk: But
basically, if you imagine that,

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:48.670
since the sixth string
is in E flat,

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:52.950
the fourth string is D flat, and
the second string is in B flat.

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:56.950
So every other string is
basically has all the notes

00:10:56.950 --> 00:11:00.550
shifted one inch, or in
the case of the D flat,

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:03.590
it's even stranger,
because it's a third.

00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:07.050
So I know about 10
scoredaturas on the guitar,

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:09.120
something like this,
a lot of scoredaturas.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.530
I know E flat in
the sixth string.

00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:14.440
There's one piece by
Takemitsu that uses a B flat

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:17.200
in the second string, and I
don't of any piece except for,

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:21.360
I think, Hilda has another piece
has an even weirder scoredatura.

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:23.000
But aside from that,
I'm not aware of --

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.760
I'm not aware, you
know, we don't grow

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.060
up with these scoredaturas.

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:30.570
I grew up with about 10
scoredaturas, but not this one.

00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:37.320
So it really is a
mental gymnastics,

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:40.480
because she's calling for
lightning-quick reaction.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:44.370
This repertoire that the
RTT plays requires a kind

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:46.820
of virtuosity.

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:48.610
I mean, I consider -- I
tried to explain to --

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:51.720
to thank them that are really
a more highly evolved form

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.020
of human being.

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:55.430
It's like I'm a Neanderthal,
and they are Homo sapiens,

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:57.010
and they have to try
to bring me along.

00:11:57.010 --> 00:11:59.550
You know, and I'm not
anywhere near their level,

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:03.480
but they have been so gracious
to me and been so kind to me

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:07.500
in allowing me to sort
of stumble along and try

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:09.550
to enter their wonderful
universe.

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:11.010
&gt;&gt; Irvine Arditti:
What should I say, man?

00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:13.010
[ Laughter ]

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:15.030
[ Inaudible Speech ]

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:17.040
[ Laughter ]

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:18.590
No, he's great.

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:21.710
It's just we're slightly more
experienced playing this sort

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:23.010
of music.

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:25.250
I mean, but I think that's
why he wanted to do it.

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:26.770
Isn't that right?

00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:28.560
&gt;&gt; Eliot Fisk: Yeah,
it's like jumping

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.250
out of a plane the
first time, I guess.

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.680
You know, it's -- but not sure

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:35.160
that the parachute
was going to open.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:36.580
So...

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:37.880
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Well,
could you tell us a bit more

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.330
about the origins of the piece?

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:45.270
I know that the name has a
rather multiple meanings that --

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:51.760
&gt;&gt; Hilda Paredes: Yes, well,
it has sun, the word sun.

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:57.680
It can mean they are
or it can mean sun.

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:01.970
It's a musical form, a
popular musical form, in --

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:03.270
&gt;&gt; Eliot Fisk: Barcos?

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:04.570
&gt;&gt; Hilda Paredes: Eh?

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:05.870
&gt;&gt; Eliot Fisk: Barcocina.

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:08.570
&gt;&gt; Hilda Paredes: Yeah, yeah,
in Mexico, it's a musical form.

00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:10.900
The piece has nothing to do

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:16.060
with traditional popular Mexican
music, and the second part

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:19.110
of the title, Dementes Cuerdas,

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:27.240
can mean they are demential
strings or it can mean song,

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:30.140
the musical form, of
demential strings,

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:34.300
or it can also mean they
are of sound of mind

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:38.440
if you divide the word
de-mente-cuerda means --

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:41.320
yeah, it can also mean
they are of sound mind.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:44.330
So it has multiple
meanings, and for me,

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:53.820
this opens up a whole idea of
the kind of liquidity of --

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:58.150
music doesn't have
a meaning, as such,

00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:00.370
or it has so many meanings.

00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:05.880
It has as many meanings as
ears or open ears are out there

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:11.760
to listen to it and to allow
the music to get inside them.

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:15.140
So for me, this is very
-- an appropriate title.

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:16.900
It also makes reference,
of course,

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:21.240
to the multiple techniques that
I use in the piece, particularly

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:22.540
in the string quartet.

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:25.780
You going to hear and
see the players do things

00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:30.270
that are not very conventional.

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:31.880
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Yeah, there
are moments in the piece.

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:33.250
I've only been able to listen

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:36.700
through completely just the
once, but there are moments

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:39.590
where it feels like it's
almost turned into a, I guess,

00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:42.320
what would be a 22-string
guitar or something like that,

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:44.910
where it really --
it has that effect.

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:48.610
I mean, of course there's
other places where I don't want

00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:51.190
to say there's tension between
them, but it's more distinctive,

00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:54.510
but there really are these
really especially beautiful

00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:56.640
moments when some of the
harmonics kind of pop

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:58.470
out that are really something.

00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:02.030
And then, also this mega guitar.

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:04.680
&gt;&gt; Hilda Paredes: Well,
it is many strings there.

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:07.490
So you can -- I play in
the piece there's this --

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:10.870
in the middle section,
there's a very expressive solo

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:14.580
for the guitar, and the string
quartet only shadows the

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:17.580
harmonies, and there's
moments, as you say,

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:20.990
that the whole ensemble
becomes a mega instrument.

00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:22.290
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Yeah.

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:23.590
&gt;&gt; Hilda Paredes: Yeah.

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:24.890
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Well, it's
a very beautiful piece,

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:26.280
and we're looking forward to it.

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:28.550
I know this is just the premier,

00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:31.910
but do you have plans
to record it or --

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:33.210
&gt;&gt; Hilda Paredes: Hopefully.

00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:34.510

discussed that.

to perform it first.

also a lot of courage.

from his plucking

and dexterity on the guitar.

you're welcome to stay with us,

I will just say see you.

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:13.800
See you out there, and thank
you so much for coming,

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:18.410

of Congress could be, really,

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:22.370

wonderful project,

part of, and I'm looking forward

[ Applause ]

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:41.890
Maybe we could speak a bit more
about the rest of the program.

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:43.640
As we mentioned at
the very beginning,

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.440
there's a wide variety of music.

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:46.740
So each piece is -- kind

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:50.330
of represents something
that's quite different.

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:53.200
The piece that I have not
heard it all is the Manoury,

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:56.940
but you have played all four
of his, or at least all four

00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:58.870
of the ones that
he didn't disavow.

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:00.480
&gt;&gt; Irvine Arditti: No,
that's not true, actually.

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:03.490
I read your program notes,
which are quite extensive.

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:06.460
I mean, there's nothing much
more I can say about the piece.

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:09.930
It's all written in the program,
but the very early quartet,

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:13.400
we have a strange relationship
with Philippe Manoury,

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:15.100
because most composers
we work with,

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:18.330
and they write us a quartet,
or whatever the piece is,

00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:21.060
and then some years later, they
usually write another piece,

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:23.650
and there's before you
know where you are,

00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:27.130
there's a whole repertoire
of string quartets,

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:28.900
usually, from composers.

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:31.990
With Philippe, we
played the early quartet,

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:33.290
which is mentioned
in the program.

00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:36.670
We played it in a festival,
I think, in the 80s.

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:37.970
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Seventy-eight?

00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:39.270
&gt;&gt; Irvine Arditti:
Oh, was it 70s?

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:40.570
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Well, he
said it was composed in '78.

00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:41.870
So it would be --

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:43.170
&gt;&gt; Irvine Arditti: I think so.

00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:44.470
Yeah, it was soon after then.

00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:45.770
I don't remember exactly
when we played it,

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:48.380
maybe in the early 80s, and
I was not particularly fond

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:53.620
of the piece, but we played it
a few times, half a dozen times.

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:57.890
And then, we lost touch.

00:17:57.890 --> 00:17:59.570
We didn't ask him
for another quartet,

00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:02.230
and there were two French
composers together we played

00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:03.530
at that concert.

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:06.660
One was Pascal Dusapin, and the
other one was Philippe Manoury.

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:09.170
I mention that because the last
time we were here we played

00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:10.700
for the Phillips Collection,

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:13.210
and we played a quartet
of Pascal Dusapin.

00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:16.200
So we met these two composers
when they were young,

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.370
and with Dusapin, we
continued the relationship,

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:22.090
and he wrote almost all
his quartets following

00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:25.400
that very first one that
we played in this concert.

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:29.200
With Philippe Manoury, we
had stopped having contact

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:32.660
until quite a few years
later, I think at the end

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:37.550
of the 20th century when
he wrote his string quartet

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:39.230
called Stringendo.

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:42.290
And then, he decided,
at some point,

00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:45.440
that the early quartet was
not to be played anymore,

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:48.050
and I think in between, I'd
asked him for a quartet,

00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:50.630
and he got really upset,
because he wanted us

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:53.580
to play the early one more, and
he said, "I've written you one.

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:56.380
You don't play it."

00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:58.220
So there were quite a lot
of years that went by,

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:01.470
early 80s till I don't
remember exactly when the --

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:03.210
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: It
was 2010 was when --

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:04.520
&gt;&gt; Irvine Arditti: Was it 2010?

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:06.570
Okay, so that's helluva
lot of years.

00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:10.280
So he wrote -- then
he decided that okay,

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:14.030
Irvine doesn't particularly
like the first quartet.

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:16.310
Perhaps I will withdraw it.

00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:18.900
I don't particularly
like it either.

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:21.510
I must say, by this time,
I'm beginning to quite

00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:26.420
like it again, but I
do love to be obtuse,

00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:28.160
especially with composers.

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.790
But then he wrote Stringendo.

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:35.440
Then he wrote another
piece with electronics,

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:38.220
not for us, for a
French quartet.

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:40.370
And then he wrote --

00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:41.670
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Melencolia.

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:42.970
&gt;&gt; Irvine Arditti: Melencolia,

00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:44.270
which is a very challenging
piece.

00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:48.090
It's like 45 minutes long,
and we have to play crotalas,

00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:50.760
as well as our instruments.

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:54.510
And sometimes there's
crotalas bells, and sometimes,

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:56.680
we have a mallet, but
sometimes there's no time

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:58.750
to pick up the mallet.

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:02.480
So you have to the
crotalas with the point

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:05.530
of the bow, the pin of the bow.

00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:07.520
It's very challenging.

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:09.190
I don't know if they've
got any good bows here,

00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:12.030
but I was thinking of asking
them if I could borrow one,

00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:15.050
and we could actually
play it next time.

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:16.350
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Well, actually,

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:17.780
we have a view Tourte
bows over there.

00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:19.080
&gt;&gt; Irvine Arditti:
No, no, Tourtes.

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:20.380
Yeah, no, no Tourtes
to go with that --

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:21.790
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: No, we do
have -- I think we do actually.

00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:23.090
&gt;&gt; Irvine Arditti: You do, yeah.

00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:24.960
Okay, well, I wouldn't
really ask that.

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:28.840
And then, recently, Stringendo
arrived a couple of years ago,

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:31.970
and it's probably the most
concise of the pieces,

00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:34.880
the piece we'll play tonight,
and I like Philippe's writing,

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:38.770
because it almost
goes back to the past.

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:40.850
It's not a minimalism.

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:42.560
It doesn't get up to the antics

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:47.510
that the last piece we'll
play, Lachenmann does.

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:51.010
It's actually going back
to playing the instrument

00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:53.800
as I was taught to
play it many years ago,

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:56.520
which is sometimes quite
refreshing from composers,

00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:59.070
because we play all
sorts of different music

00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:02.750
and are well-known for getting
up to all sorts of things.

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:04.750
And so, in actual fact,

00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:08.420
now Philippe Manoury has written
a whole gamut of string quartets

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:13.650
for us, and we continued the
relationship after a long pause,

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:16.030
and going back to the
joke of the first quartet.

00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:18.810
We played the other quartets
in a festival in England,

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:20.600
and we wanted to play
something from him.

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:23.200
This was in our 40th
anniversary three years ago.

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:27.940
And the only piece that fit
it was the early quartet.

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:30.520
So I had to phone him
up and say, Philippe,

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:33.540
do you mind if we play
that early quartet

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:35.940
that you said was withdrawn?

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:39.370
And he said, "Okay, Irvine,
you can play it, but once."

00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:42.850
So we played it a few years ago.

00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:44.150
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Oh, wow.

00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:45.620
Well, you know, something
that you said struck me

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:48.910
as a bit unfair for a
composer to complain about,

00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:50.270
which is that, you know,

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:52.480
why haven't you been playing
my piece in the meantime,

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:56.390
because you play so many new
pieces that are written for you

00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:58.940
or are just part
of the literature.

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:02.890
One thing that, you know, I
think that, at least I have

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:05.160
as a question, and I'm sure
other people do, as well.

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:09.550
How do you manage to -- they're
such diverse types of pieces

00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:13.350
that require so much thought
and care to put together.

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:16.450
How do you go about this
process of planning programming?

00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:19.610
Do you do this years in advance?

00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:21.980
Do you have like just
rigorous rehearsal schedule

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:24.730
that allows you to
accomplish these things?

00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:27.010
&gt;&gt; Irvine Arditti: What would
you like to hear tomorrow?

00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:28.310
[ Laughter ]

00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:29.610
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: All right.

00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:31.190
&gt;&gt; Irvine Arditti: I mean,
there's a core nucleus of pieces

00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:34.760
that we can play almost
without any rehearsal,

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:39.200
because we play them so often,
and that's great, because,

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:41.830
I think, you have to be quick
learning contemporary music.

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:45.560
If you take a long time doing
it, you'll never get very far.

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:48.330
I mean, you have to access
the pieces quite quickly

00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:51.230
to know what they're all
about, and we do quite a lot

00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:53.550
of work before we meet.

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:56.860
We take the parts and the score,
and we put lots of markings in.

00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:59.310
So that before the
first rehearsal,

00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:02.690
we know exactly what our
colleagues are playing.

00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:05.910
And so, it minimalizes
the rehearsal time.

00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:08.470
It's like being a conductor,
each being a conductor

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:09.770
and studying the score,

00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:14.390
so you know what each instrument
is supposed to do, so your part

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:17.040
in a quartet, your part
in relation to the others.

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:20.270
And then, I think the learning
process becomes quite quick.

00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:21.690
Obviously, the piece develops.

00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:23.570
You know, if you're playing
a piece for the first time,

00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:24.870
it's not going to be the same

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:27.940
as if you're playing
it for the 10th time.

00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:31.750
I think we've played Philippe
Manoury's piece now eight

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:33.550
or 10 times.

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:37.150
We've played Grido more
than a hundred times.

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:38.450
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Oh, wow.

00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:40.550
&gt;&gt; Irvine Arditti: And
that's quite a lot,

00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:43.530
considering that with a
lot of pieces we've played,

00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:48.170
not many other quartets play
those pieces, but with Grido,

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:53.710
there were at least nine or 10
quartets that play that piece.

00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:56.160
And considering, you know,
the techniques involved

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:59.610
with Lachenmann's
music, that's changed

00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:02.100
over the past 10 or 15 years.

00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:03.400
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Sure.

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.350
Well, before we get to the
Lachenmann, I do want to speak

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:06.650
about that a little bit.

00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:07.950
Hilda, I was wondering,
maybe you could speak

00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:10.740
about your experience of
writing for the Arditti Quartet,

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:13.570
because you've done that
for other pieces, as well,

00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:15.890
and is it always a case

00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:19.520
where everything's perfect right
off the bat, or do you get a lot

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:22.730
of feedback, or what's
the interaction like?

00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:27.710
&gt;&gt; Hilda Paredes: Well, for me,

00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:34.150
it's probably the biggest
challenge, I have to say,

00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:38.300
and I have written
orchestral music.

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:44.060
I have written operas an ex --
a new opera now, but for me,

00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:48.870
the biggest challenge is the
string quartet for these guys.

00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:53.040
Why? Because I know the
experience they have.

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:57.080
I know that the stature
of these musicians,

00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:00.620
and because I know almost all
the composers they have worked

00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:06.770
with, and many of them are
people that I highly respect.

00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:11.010
And so, and it's also a medium

00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:13.220
that you cannot hide
as a composer.

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:18.600
You cannot just sort
of use the orchestra

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:22.600
to hide behind the big
noise or something.

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:26.730
I mean, everything, everything
you write comes through.

00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:29.900
So yes, for me, it's
the biggest challenge.

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:32.200
So,

00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:38.410
also, because I sent myself
very high standards when I write

00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:43.140
for them, and from the very
first quartet I wrote for them

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:47.810
in '98, these quartets, I had

00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:50.340
to make a decision then whether
I would just write string

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:52.090
quartet, or whether
I would write a piece

00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:56.030
for the Arditti Quartet,
and I chose the second.

00:25:56.030 --> 00:26:00.400
And I think it was a wise
choice, because having made

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:04.930
that decision, I grew as a
composer, because I was able

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:08.600
to challenge myself, and I knew

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:12.070
that anything I would write
they would be able to play.

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:16.990
And that has a double edge, yes?

00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:20.360
So the second time
I wrote for them,

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:21.870
I want to the same experience.

00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:26.990
I wanted to grow even more,
and in my third quartet,

00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:31.460
it was just a more intimate
piece, a tribute to this journey

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:35.440
of 20 years with some
-- which we shared.

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:36.740
And --

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:38.800
&gt;&gt; Irvine Arditti: I have to
tell you, Hilda is my wife,

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:41.550
if you don't know that,

00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:46.090
and that's why she's seen
all the composers come

00:26:46.090 --> 00:26:49.840
into our house and rehearse with
us, and that's why she lives

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:53.070
with lots of string
quartets being played,

00:26:53.070 --> 00:27:00.870
and she's on another floor
trying to write music.

00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:03.830
&gt;&gt; Hilda Paredes: Yeah,
so that's -- that's it.

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:08.120
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Yeah
that's a -- go off track.

00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:09.420
&gt;&gt; Hilda Paredes: Yeah.

00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:10.720
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Well, it's
always interesting to hear

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:12.550
about these different types of
interactions, because I think

00:27:12.550 --> 00:27:16.140
for most people, it's an
unknowable type of thing.

00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:17.440
They don't compose.

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:19.180
Although if you don't,
you should compose.

00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:22.200
Everybody should
compose, I think.

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:25.790
Going back to the Lachenmann,
which is on the second half,

00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:29.240
I'm wondering if you could say
a few words about its origin

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:32.400
and working with Lachenmann,
what that was like.

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:35.010
Because I know one of the
things that you'd mentioned,

00:27:35.010 --> 00:27:37.550
some of the different
techniques, especially from some

00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:41.890
of the earlier quartets,
part of it is almost seems

00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:43.720
like there needs to be a
demonstration or something

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:45.780
like that, in order to
really understand it.

00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:48.940
I don't know if you found
that to be the case.

00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:50.720
&gt;&gt; Irvine Arditti: Well,
we've had a long relationship,

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:53.240
I have and quartet,
various different members

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:56.290
of the quartet, with Lachenmann.

00:27:56.290 --> 00:28:01.110
I like having relationships
with composers.

00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:03.210
[ Laughter ]

00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:04.510
&gt;&gt; David Plylar:
Right thing to say.

00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:05.820
&gt;&gt; Irvine Arditti: But this is a
different sort of relationship,

00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:08.620
but going back to Helmut, I
think we first played his music

00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:13.410
in '85, and we weren't
very successful.

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:15.410
We played the first
quartet, Gran Torso.

00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:17.160
It's a complicated piece.

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:20.890
There's a lot of theater,
motions, in it playing

00:28:20.890 --> 00:28:24.360
on the body of the instrument
doing all sorts of things.

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:26.430
And it's rather against
the music.

00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:30.750
It was like a protest
at the time,

00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:33.880
and we weren't terribly good
at doing that sort of thing.

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:38.640
We started off playing difficult
music, normal, complex music,

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:40.560
and found we could
do it quite well,

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:43.650
but we weren't very
good at making noises.

00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:49.410
And it's very funny, because I
think Helmut says he asked the

00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:55.880
promoter to have his cost of
travel coming from Germany

00:28:55.880 --> 00:29:00.040
to London after the
concert, so he could work

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:03.440
with us more on the piece.

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:07.590
And I didn't know this until
quite recently, but Helmut came

00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:11.760
and he stayed, and I think
once he stayed for a week,

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:13.410
we played all his pieces.

00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:16.140
There's a great piece
called Tanzsuite for quartet

00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:19.690
and orchestra, which
we've done many times,

00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:23.360
and after Gran Torso, both of
the next quartets were written

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:27.270
for us, Reigen seliger
Geister and Grido,

00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:28.790
which we play tonight.

00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:31.170
And so, we really had a
great relationship with him.

00:29:31.170 --> 00:29:33.160
I think you have
to know composers.

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:37.460
You have to understand them,
as well as understanding them.

00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:40.190
I mean, I started
playing contemporary music

00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:43.060
when I was very young.

00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:44.360
I knew Ligeti.

00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:46.390
I knew everybody.

00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:47.930
I knew Carter.

00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:49.360
I knew Cage.

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:52.740
And if you have some knowledge
of the way people react,

00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:54.260
you have meals with
them, or they come

00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:56.240
and stay with you to rehearse.

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:59.510
I Xenakis very well.

00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:03.820
I feel qualified as a kind
of link to play their music,

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:06.090
because I understood
exactly what they wanted.

00:30:06.090 --> 00:30:08.260
And of course, there are
hundreds of other composers,

00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:12.340
less well-known people
also, of a tradition

00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:14.230
that one can pass down.

00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:18.400
But Helmut's a very special
character, because he works

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:20.240
out all his techniques.

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:22.340
You can actually
do them himself,

00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:25.290
even though he can't
really play the instruments,

00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:28.680
and all the techniques that he
asks for, he can demonstrate,

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:31.490
and I love getting him
to demonstrate things,

00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:35.320
because he holds the instrument
in a very odd way, the violin

00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:39.690
and the bow, but the way he
holds it is the most perfect way

00:30:39.690 --> 00:30:43.520
to realize what he's written.

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:46.530
And so you, just by
looking at what he does,

00:30:46.530 --> 00:30:48.560
sometimes we have
fun in workshops.

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:52.180
I give him my violin, and
I just watch him again

00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:55.450
and see what he does and how
easily he gets these sounds.

00:30:55.450 --> 00:30:57.620
And of course, you're
not taught.

00:30:57.620 --> 00:31:01.190
You naturally, as a
violinist or a string player,

00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:03.210
you don't hold the
instrument in that way,

00:31:03.210 --> 00:31:05.800
and I remember the reason
we were unsuccessful

00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:09.990
in the beginning was because all
these weird ways he taught us

00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:13.150
to hold the bow, in the
panic of the concert,

00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:18.140
you just forget them, and you go
back to what you normally know.

00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:21.280
And it takes a while,
it takes a few concerts

00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:22.580
of playing his music

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:25.370
to understand exactly
what you have to do.

00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:28.810
And for some of the
rehearsals we had with him,

00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:32.030
we'd work independently
one-and-a-half days,

00:31:32.030 --> 00:31:35.020
each player, and the
important thing was

00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:36.970
to learn the techniques.

00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:41.280
The rehearsing of the pieces, we
could do in a way without him,

00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:44.980
but to understand from
the beginning what we had

00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:46.750
to do was the most
important thing,

00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:48.050
and if you really understand

00:31:48.050 --> 00:31:51.990
from the beginning,
you rehearse right.

00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:55.490
So many people do not do their
homework at the beginning

00:31:55.490 --> 00:32:00.850
and rehearse wrong, and
then they perfect wrong.

00:32:00.850 --> 00:32:02.540
And then, they're very
good at playing it wrong,

00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:04.720
and then they find it very
difficult to play it right

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:07.970
when somebody says, "No-no,
you have to do it like this."

00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:10.280
And so, that's why,
from the very beginnings

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:13.420
of the Arditti Quartet,
I realized the importance

00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:17.340
of actually working with
composers, rehearsing pieces

00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:21.720
with the composers fairly
early on in the relationship

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:23.900
between you and the
piece, even, perhaps,

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:28.340
before you can play it properly,
is to find out what they want,

00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:30.240
so you can point
your interpretation

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:31.710
in the right direction.

00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:34.830
And for me, that's one of
the most fascinating things

00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:36.140
about playing contemporary
music.

00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:41.410
It's something you can't do with
classical composers, of course.

00:32:41.410 --> 00:32:44.360
You can't phone them up.

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:45.660
&gt;&gt; Hilda Paredes: Or email them.

00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:48.150
&gt;&gt; Irvine Arditti: Or email
them, or all the other things

00:32:48.150 --> 00:32:49.780
that you can do these days.

00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:52.350
&gt;&gt; David Plylar:
Right, too many though.

00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:54.570
Well, you know, another thing
that I think that's interesting

00:32:54.570 --> 00:32:58.000
to maybe say about that
is that, in essence,

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.640
you're kind of establishing
a performance practice

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:03.660
that can then -- so
that it almost seems

00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:07.120
like a master-apprentice
relationship in terms of how

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:08.960
that type of knowledge
gets passed on,

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:11.830
because it's not always
so easy to, I think,

00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:16.070
glean from just a recording
or just the score as it is

00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:17.850
with that one-on-one
interaction.

00:33:17.850 --> 00:33:19.150
&gt;&gt; Irvine Arditti: Yeah, I mean,

00:33:19.150 --> 00:33:22.290
that's the great responsibility
what we do, being the bearers

00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:25.710
of the sound of so many
pieces for the first time.

00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:27.510
That's a huge responsibility.

00:33:27.510 --> 00:33:29.960
I remember thinking about that,
or rather, try not to think

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:31.790
about it in the early days.

00:33:31.790 --> 00:33:34.560
We do concerts at
important music festivals,

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:38.210
and the things would
be broadcast live.

00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:40.780
Today, they're often
streamed, too.

00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:42.080
They'd make recordings.

00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:45.340
They'd issue them on documentary
CDs from the festival,

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:49.010
and you knew there was no
place to try out these pieces.

00:33:49.010 --> 00:33:51.590
You know, you couldn't
try out them

00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:54.370
in some not-important
venue first.

00:33:54.370 --> 00:33:56.540
You had to get it
right the first time,

00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:58.640
and this is a great
responsibility,

00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:00.960
and it's something you
have to take seriously.

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:04.010
So it means you work
very quickly

00:34:04.010 --> 00:34:08.620
and very accurately
towards your end goal.

00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:11.760
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Well, I have
a question for both of you.

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:13.890
I thought if you could
say a few words --

00:34:13.890 --> 00:34:15.190
you mentioned an opera earlier.

00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:16.570
I don't know if you can say
anything about that yet,

00:34:16.570 --> 00:34:24.160
or maybe just speak about some
of your upcoming projects.

00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:31.960
&gt;&gt; Hilda Paredes: Yes, I am just
starting writing a monodrama,

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:37.360
an opera project based
on an American --

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:42.140
a very important American
person from the 19th century,

00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:47.220
Harriet Tubman, and it's been
the most incredible journey

00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:52.040
so far, the past 18 months, the
process, the research process.

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:57.300
I was very ignorant
about this --

00:34:57.300 --> 00:34:59.560
about Harriet Tubman
and this period

00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:03.680
in the history of North America.

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:08.230
And I'm very grateful to the
African-American soprano,

00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:11.020
Claron McFadden,
for introducing --

00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:15.830
I'm writing the piece for her,
for introducing me to her,

00:35:15.830 --> 00:35:20.520
and hopefully, it will be --

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:22.820
it's already a wonderful
journey, and hopefully,

00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:24.570
it will continue to be one.

00:35:24.570 --> 00:35:28.480
The piece is programmed
for the autumn of 2018,

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:32.850
and it's actually a commission
from a Mexican festival.

00:35:32.850 --> 00:35:36.940
And the press --
I'm sure we will,

00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:38.650
eventually, bring it to the US.

00:35:38.650 --> 00:35:42.070
I'm not so sure what the plans
are, but it's a coproduction

00:35:42.070 --> 00:35:46.950
with a music theater
transplant in Belgium.

00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:50.040
Claron McFadden lives
in the Netherlands.

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:54.280
So that's the connection,
and we are hoping

00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:56.980
to tour the piece
quite, quite widely.

00:35:56.980 --> 00:35:58.570
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Oh, fantastic.

00:35:58.570 --> 00:35:59.870
&gt;&gt; Hilda Paredes: Yes.

00:35:59.870 --> 00:36:01.260
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: And what
about the Arditti Quartet?

00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:02.560
&gt;&gt; Irvine Arditti:
Oh, don't ask me that,

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:03.860
what we're doing tomorrow.

00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:05.620
I'm thinking about
what we're doing today.

00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:07.770
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Sure, sure.

00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:10.590
Well, maybe, you know, well,
you're probably just doing a lot

00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:12.380
of new pieces that
we'll get to hear.

00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:14.190
I mean, we've all been
the beneficiaries --

00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:15.490
&gt;&gt; Irvine Arditti:
It's French year.

00:36:15.490 --> 00:36:18.940
The spring is French year
-- both two other composers,

00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:23.520
one who we have had a
relationship, Hugues Dufourt.

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:25.980
He's just written his
third quartet for us,

00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:29.650
which we will play in a few
months' time, and another one,

00:36:29.650 --> 00:36:32.260
Philippe Hurel, who
we have never --

00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:34.840
I don't think he's
written a string quartet.

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:37.510
What key is your suite in?

00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:41.760
[ Laughter ]

00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:43.550
I don't think he's
written many quartets,

00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:47.320
but he's just also
written a piece for us.

00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:48.620
&gt;&gt; David Plylar:
Well, fantastic.

00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:49.920
&gt;&gt; Irvine Arditti: So
we've got two new pieces

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:51.560
from French composers.

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:53.930
Completely coincidental
that they arrived.

00:36:53.930 --> 00:36:58.570
One is being premiered
in Vienna, and I think,

00:36:58.570 --> 00:37:00.460
the other one in Germany
in the [inaudible]

00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:04.420
in New Music Days
in two months' time.

00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:06.290
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Well, I
thought maybe, at this point,

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:09.170
we could open it up if there
any questions in the audience.

00:37:09.170 --> 00:37:11.570
What I'll ask you to
do is Jay will come

00:37:11.570 --> 00:37:12.870
around with the microphone,

00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:15.040
just so everybody
can hear the question

00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:20.230
and we keep it on the recording.

00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:22.560
&gt;&gt; Hi, question for you, Hilda.

00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:24.850
It's still very rare,
at least in America,

00:37:24.850 --> 00:37:29.460
to have a classical music
composer who was a woman,

00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:33.730
and just wondered how you got
started, how you were interested

00:37:33.730 --> 00:37:36.560
in beginning to compose, sort

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:40.650
of your progress along the
way there, and for you,

00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:45.320
I was asking a lot of people
who've written for you

00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:48.620
for your quartet,
are there any --

00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:50.830
this is politically incorrect,

00:37:50.830 --> 00:37:54.390
but are there anybody who's
avidly wanting to write for you

00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:55.800
that you're not interested in.

00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:57.110
You don't have to name names.

00:37:57.110 --> 00:38:01.150
Does that ever come up?

00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:06.640
&gt;&gt; Irvine Arditti: Who do
you want to answer first?

00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:09.330
&gt;&gt; Hilda Paredes: I think
things have changed enormously

00:38:09.330 --> 00:38:11.930
from the time when I started.

00:38:11.930 --> 00:38:16.570
As a young woman, I was always
the only lady in the class,

00:38:16.570 --> 00:38:20.970
and this has changed
more and more.

00:38:20.970 --> 00:38:26.870
There was some years ago where
the girls outnumber the boys.

00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:36.060
So, and I feel there are now
wonderful lady composers,

00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:40.330
a lot of my colleagues
whom I respect enormously

00:38:40.330 --> 00:38:45.040
and some here in
this country also.

00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:51.490
And we're all very different,
and we all have unique voices,

00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:56.900
and I find, often, the
music as inspiring as that

00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:59.960
of male colleagues,
which wasn't the case

00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:02.800
when I started as a student.

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:05.650
I think we still have
a long way to go,

00:39:05.650 --> 00:39:10.090
because there's some
environments sometimes

00:39:10.090 --> 00:39:13.100
that don't feature
lady composers as much

00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:17.770
as they should, or they feature
them too much to make a point

00:39:17.770 --> 00:39:20.180
that it has to be
women composers,

00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:24.540
as if we are blind autistic nuns

00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:28.450
or something like
that, you know?

00:39:28.450 --> 00:39:34.740
So hopefully, there will not
be a need to have festivals

00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:37.740
of women musicians one day.

00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:39.040
&gt;&gt; Irvine Arditti: I must say,

00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:41.820
in the Arditti Quartet's
repertoire, we have quite a lot

00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:46.050
of women composers and
new people, young people,

00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:50.150
and there's a woman composer
writing a piece later

00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:53.410
on in the year for a
festival [inaudible].

00:39:53.410 --> 00:39:55.990
You've never heard of her,
but her name's Clara Iannotta.

00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:57.670
She's probably in her early 30s.

00:39:57.670 --> 00:40:00.200
I mean, there's a huge amount

00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:02.930
of female composers
on our repertoire

00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:05.710
So, I mean, what you're
saying was true long time ago.

00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:08.700
It's not really true anymore,
not, at least, in Europe.

00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:10.000
I don't know if it's
true the states.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.760
I doubt it.

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:17.590
Do people I don't like
want to write pieces?

00:40:17.590 --> 00:40:21.040
It's more people that nobody
knows who want to write pieces

00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:24.250
who can't because
nobody knows them.

00:40:24.250 --> 00:40:28.550
And if they're great and they
send in a marvelous score,

00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:31.170
which I try to look at all
the scores that come in,

00:40:31.170 --> 00:40:33.640
then it might be possible.

00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:38.510
I think the people who I don't
like know I don't like them

00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:41.640
[ Laughter ]

00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:45.250
Or let's say we are good
at certain things and not

00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:47.160
so good at other things.

00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:51.290
And so, everyone knows
what sort of music we play,

00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:55.020
and I don't think those people
want to write us pieces anyway.

00:40:55.020 --> 00:41:00.260
So it's the way it
is, but it works.

00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:05.890
The system works, and I can even
talk to the people I don't like.

00:41:07.890 --> 00:41:10.670
Another hand.

00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:12.160
Oh, sorry.

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:15.950
&gt;&gt; Hilda, could you share
with us what does it mean

00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:19.550
to be a Mexican composer
living in London

00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:27.870
and what role does the Mexican
musical, tradition still has

00:41:27.870 --> 00:41:32.840
in your role as a composer?

00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:36.450
&gt;&gt; Hilda Paredes: It's a
big responsibility for me,

00:41:36.450 --> 00:41:45.070
because since I was a
student, I was very aware

00:41:45.070 --> 00:41:51.920
about the expectations
that the music industry had

00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:54.690
from someone coming
from where I come from,

00:41:54.690 --> 00:41:56.720
and it's still the case.

00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:59.450
You know, there's a lot
of expectations just

00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:01.120
because a Mexican that I'm going

00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:06.010
to be writing the unta-unta-unta
kind or some jarocho tonight

00:42:06.010 --> 00:42:07.640
or something like that.

00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:12.200
And I have been very --

00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:15.360
I dislike that extremely,
extremely.

00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:17.980
I find it extremely patronizing.

00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:22.740
I think there is great, great
ignorance about our history,

00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:28.940
about the incredible,
rich culture that we have,

00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:35.050
and it's that the European
influence didn't finish.

00:42:35.050 --> 00:42:39.610
We are a mixed breed, and
throughout the 20th century,

00:42:39.610 --> 00:42:41.990
their been has been
so much immigration

00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:46.330
from so many countries that
have enriched our own culture

00:42:46.330 --> 00:42:48.840
and have enriched my music.

00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:51.540
So for me, it's a
big responsibility,

00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:58.690
because I feel I am writing
Mexican music, but not the music

00:42:58.690 --> 00:43:00.770
that that industry

00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:07.220
of entertainment thinks
Mexican music should be.

00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:09.520
Yes?

00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:14.580
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: We
have another question.

00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:21.330
&gt;&gt; This is for Hilda, as well,
but it could be for both of you.

00:43:21.330 --> 00:43:25.450
In doing your research for your
monodrama on Harriet Tubman,

00:43:25.450 --> 00:43:31.010
will you and your partner have
time to go to the eastern shore

00:43:31.010 --> 00:43:35.600
of Maryland and see some of
the places where she lived.

00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:39.930
I believe there's a new Harriet
Tubman Museum that just opened,

00:43:39.930 --> 00:43:41.570
and the other question is,

00:43:41.570 --> 00:43:48.330
I believe your first opera was a
joint experimental theater piece

00:43:48.330 --> 00:43:53.050
based upon the experiences of
immigrants, migrants trying

00:43:53.050 --> 00:44:00.040
to cross between north -- across
the border, or am I quick to --

00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:05.220
and are there any plans for that
opera to be performed in London,

00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:06.520
Berlin, or Washington?

00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:08.020
Thank you.

00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:11.110
&gt;&gt; Hilda Paredes: I think the
piece your mentioning was not my

00:44:11.110 --> 00:44:12.410
first opera.

00:44:12.410 --> 00:44:15.020
It's my most recent
music theater piece.

00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:17.530
It's La tierra de la
miel, which is part

00:44:17.530 --> 00:44:22.750
of a collaborative
project, Cuatro corridos,

00:44:22.750 --> 00:44:25.500
which was a collaboration
with three other composers.

00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:32.390
There was four of us, and what
ties the four pieces is a story

00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:36.120
of the Mexican writer
Jorge Volpe.

00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:39.810
This links with your
other question.

00:44:39.810 --> 00:44:42.780
I work a lot, particularly,

00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:47.010
with Mexican poets
and Mexican writers.

00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:52.900
So it was -- the subject
matter, it was a true story,

00:44:52.900 --> 00:45:00.030
and it's based on the human
trafficking that women that come

00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:01.330
from -- thin and single.

00:45:01.330 --> 00:45:05.440
They're brought into this
country as prostitutes,

00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:11.140
and this was a story that
hit the New York Times

00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:13.740
because it was the cartel
that was bringing --

00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:18.510
the gang of people that were
bringing these women were

00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:21.550
discovered by Chicana
policewoman,

00:45:21.550 --> 00:45:23.210
and they were brought
to justice,

00:45:23.210 --> 00:45:25.340
and the whole thing
was dismantled.

00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:27.670
So in a way, it's
a happy ending,

00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:32.350
but we know that these
things still happen.

00:45:32.350 --> 00:45:33.650
&gt;&gt; Irvine Arditti: Was it
done on the East Coast?

00:45:33.650 --> 00:45:35.010
It was done first in San Diego.

00:45:35.010 --> 00:45:36.590
&gt;&gt; Hilda Paredes: It
was done in San Diego

00:45:36.590 --> 00:45:38.910
with the story took place.

00:45:38.910 --> 00:45:48.210
Yes, and it has toured a lot,
the United States, and the CD is

00:45:48.210 --> 00:45:52.640
out there in Bridge
Records also.

00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:56.900
So this is like my
most recent one.

00:45:56.900 --> 00:46:00.000
For some reason, a lot of my --

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:05.380
every project I do for the stage
has a lot of political or social

00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:07.690
or gender connotations.

00:46:07.690 --> 00:46:10.870
And so, the invitation
to do something

00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:16.270
on Harriet Tubman was just the
kind of thing that was made

00:46:16.270 --> 00:46:19.270
for me, because I
really feel very strongly

00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:20.990
about these issues.

00:46:20.990 --> 00:46:25.580
I think they are not exclusive
to this country, not exclusive

00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:30.490
to the problems with slavery
and to African-Americans.

00:46:30.490 --> 00:46:34.700
I think they're more
universal and more humane.

00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:39.890
I wish the project had
enough funds for me to travel

00:46:39.890 --> 00:46:45.780
to Maryland with my librettist
and my stage director.

00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:50.620
We're really struggling to find
the funds for this project,

00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:53.190
and it's a very small project.

00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:57.110
We'll have three instruments,
electronics, one singer,

00:46:57.110 --> 00:47:00.510
and a girl, and that's it.

00:47:00.510 --> 00:47:03.110
[ Speaking off Mic ]

00:47:03.110 --> 00:47:04.410
So the stage director --

00:47:04.410 --> 00:47:07.040
yes, Matthew Lutton
is from Australia.

00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:11.790
Mayra Febres is a Puerto Rican
writer, Mayra Santos-Febres,

00:47:11.790 --> 00:47:17.780
who is a specialist on slavery
and all these subject matters.

00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:24.620
So we are communicating
through Skype and FaceTime.

00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:26.080
Yeah.

00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:27.380
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: I
think we have time

00:47:27.380 --> 00:47:29.790
for just one more
question if there is one.

00:47:32.770 --> 00:47:35.110
All right, well,
thank you so much.

00:47:35.110 --> 00:47:36.410

treat tonight.

This is some really
gorgeous music and really,

00:47:38.910 --> 00:47:40.840
just exciting music, too.

00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:42.500
So I'm really excited about it.
