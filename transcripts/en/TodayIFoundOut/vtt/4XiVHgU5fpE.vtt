00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.480
The staple ingredient for both corn and tortilla
chips is, of course, corn.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.020
An ear of corn is made up of individual rows
of kernels, and each kernel is attached to

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.119
the cob via the tip cap located at the very
bottom of the kernel.

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.680
Strip away the tip cap and the hilum is revealed.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:32.500
The hilum is what seals the base of each kernel
and draws in water and other nutrients needed

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.500
during the growth process.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.190
The hilum, in a way, serves as a sort of umbilical
cord for the kernel.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.850
Once the kernels detach from the cob, the
hilum remains as a type of scar from where

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:43.850
it was connected.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.260
corn2The hilum starts out clear then progresses
to light green, then light brown, and finally

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.190
black, which shows up on more mature kernels.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.980
It is these mature kernels that are used to
make corn and tortilla chips.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.460
Since these specks of hilum do not disappear
during the cooking process, they remain visible

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.960
in the final food product.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.420
In addition to corn and tortilla chips, the
black hilum can also typically be seen on

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:31.549
taco shells, corn tortillas, and other similar
foods made with corn.
