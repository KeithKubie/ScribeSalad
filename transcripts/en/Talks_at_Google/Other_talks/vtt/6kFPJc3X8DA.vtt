00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.960
&gt;&gt;Nikolas: [inaudible] has published somewhere
around, more than 200 reports on what is happening

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:14.779
on the Internet, how the Internet is changing
our society, and how it is generally teaching

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:21.240
us lots of new things; everything from politics
to censorship. So, the, the amount of, of

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.430
different reports and, and interesting stuff
out of the Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:32.070
is just amazing. So I'm really happy to have
our speaker here today. Lee Rainie has been

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.780
the director of, of the Project for quite
some time, since--

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:36.780
&gt;&gt; (Lee) Ten years.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.730
&gt;&gt;Nikolas: ten years now and before it, he
came to the Pew Internet Project he was the

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.870
Managing Editor of the US News &amp; World Report.
He's a graduate of Harvard University, has

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.579
a master's degree in political science from
them, Long Island University. And he's today

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:52.749
going to be talking on as you've probably
seen these little things, "The Rise of Networked

00:00:52.749 --> 00:00:57.231
Individuals: The Millennial Tide." So, please
welcome Lee Rainie.

00:00:57.231 --> 00:01:00.239
[applause]

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:08.390
&gt;&gt;Lee: It is, it's an honor for me and the
Pew Internet Project to, to be here. It, one

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.810
of the really fun things about a job like
mine is people are nice to you, like Nikolas

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.719
and it, he had no reason to be nice to me
other than he works at a great place and he's

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:19.520
a nice guy and has given me a wonderful opportunity.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.869
For those of you who might need a, a Pew 101,
Pew, I- I'm funded by a wonderful public charity

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:32.790
called the Pew Charitable Trusts. They had
funded me to be- to generate information.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:39.929
We do primary research into the social impact
of the Internet. The Pew does other work that

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:44.450
supports advocacy to help make the world better
in a lot of ways; in the environment, in healthcare,

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.770
education, and, and, and social policy.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.859
We're different from that in the sense that
Pew has ordered us not to promote an agenda.

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:56.939
We, we literally take no stands on policy
issues related to the Internet, technologies,

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:02.659
companies, or people. But we do try to do
primary research that would be useful to people

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.999
who are helping build the Internet at every
level, including wonderful folks like you.

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:12.441
And Pew is a family name. It's not an acronym,
it's not P-E-W all Caps, it's Pew, it's a

00:02:12.441 --> 00:02:18.140
family name, it-, it's a, it's a great oil
and shipping fortune from the late 19th century

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.980
that was passed along to the children of the
family. They created charitable trusts. It's,

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.770
it's, and so I-, it's a precious thing to
me because it's a family name so I, I, I hope

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.940
I don't mess up and, and embarrass the wonderful
family that's been helping me.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:38.120
And in order to understand where I'm coming
from, it, people don't necessarily grasp that

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.690
I, that an organization can be based in Washington
and have no policy point of view. We call

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:47.240
ourselves a "fact tank" because we don't advocate
for things and finally that, that didn't seem

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.130
to be working in a, a, a geologist actually
came up to a colleague of mine and said, "I

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.890
get what you are. You're an Internet geologist;
you study the rocks, you just don't judge

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.320
the rocks." So that's a, that's a great way
to understand what we are.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.830
As I say, we study the social impacts of the
Internet. So we look at how the Internet affects

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.780
families and communities and healthcare and
education and things like that. And I will

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.300
be talking about our research, but I'm, I'm
pretty interested in hearing from you if you

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.740
know any of the work that we've done or if
you think about the existence of an institution

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:18.740
like ours.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:23.861
What should a place like ours that has no
agenda that has support to do primary research,

00:03:23.861 --> 00:03:30.140
what should we be looking at in the context
of the social impact of the Internet? I'd,

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.030
I'd be particularly interested in hearing
about survey ideas because we do-, the data

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.810
I'm going to be presenting, a lot of it will
be based on surveys. But we are just now dipping

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.040
our toes in the water of thinking about how
an organization like ours can do computational

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.850
social science. So I, I, in the questions
that you have, and I would encourage you to

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.250
ask questions as they arise. I'd be interested
in hearing about your ideas, what we should

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.990
do and particularly how we can use sor-, the
massive amounts of data that are being generated

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:01.341
here and in other places in the world.

00:04:01.341 --> 00:04:05.740
And the final thing I'm going to do before
I start talking about what I'm going to say

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.911
is, is to issue my standard apology at the
beginning of any speech I give. I am, have

00:04:10.911 --> 00:04:17.169
acculturated myself in the two worst communications
cultures in America. I was born and raised

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:22.450
in New York so I talk really fast, so I apologize
all, of, at the beginning now that I'm gonna

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:27.030
speak quickly. I can't help myself. This is
in my DNA. And then, of course, I move to

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:32.750
Washington at the midway part of my life so
I can talk really long. So I, I can filibuster

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.400
fast is basically what I can do and I'm sorry
for that now.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.400
[audience member laughs]

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.260
If I'm really going too fast for you, if you're
having trouble understanding me, raise your

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.180
hand. Give me a crook in my cheek or something
like that and I will try to respond to you.

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:51.900
What I was gonna do today is, is talk about
a, a sort of grand synthesis of the work that

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:57.530
we've been doing since we went into business
in 2000 and, and then to explore ideas about

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:02.150
how we can move forward, not only with our
survey work but with this computational research.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:09.650
The big idea that we've sort of pulled together,
thanks to our, our research and, and readings

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:15.560
in, in other areas, is that people have moved
in their social structures from a position

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:21.840
of sort of tight-knit, bounded social relationships
where they live in small communities that

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.680
everybody knows your business and everybody
knows everybody else's business and everybody

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.730
knows each other. That's the world the villages,
the tight-knit families, and even tight-knit

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:36.170
workplaces. The argument that we see emerging
in our data, and it began to emerge even before

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:41.720
the technology revolutions that we are under,
is that the world has moved more towards networks.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:46.250
A colleague of mine, who matter of fact I'm
writing a book with him, a sociologist at

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:50.810
the University of Toronto named Barry Wellman,
has talked about life in the latter half of

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:55.050
the 20th century and the emerging part of
the 21st century as being lived in a state

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:00.170
of networked individualism where we've moved
from these tight-knit groups, where we get

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:04.280
our social support and our care and feeding
and nurturing in the world, to more networking

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:09.070
behavior where we can maneuver a little bit
more easily through more dispersed networks

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:14.419
and more kinds of social relations. But we
pay some pr-, prices for that social change

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:17.260
that I'll talk about later.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:21.850
Before I get to the technology piece of this
I will just run through a couple of big social

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:26.450
and political trends that are already driving
culture towards networked individualism, which

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:30.510
means that people have more power themselves
to be their own individual actors, or people

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:34.730
are forced to be their own individual actors
because social structures around them that

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:38.980
were built on that tight-knit networks were,
were changing.

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:43.090
The first big change, of course, is affluence
and technology itself. Th-, it's put in to

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:48.430
our hands, particularly in the developed world,
a sense that we can do more things on our

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:54.770
own. We can array, we can use media, we can
use o-, other tools at our disposal to do

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:59.520
things that it used to take larger groups
of people and collectives to perform.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.780
The second thing is that family composition
itself has forced people to be networkers,

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:08.620
as roles inside families have become even
more networked themselves. Think about each

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:14.610
spouse has his or her own address book, his
or h- own professional network to deal with,

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:21.520
his or h-, own, his or her own social networks
to deal with when they have troubles in their

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:22.520
lives.

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:26.380
Families themselves have become networks and
so people even inside their own households

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:30.940
have now had to take more responsibility on
for managing their own lives and, and, and

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:35.400
engaging the world in their own ways. There's
obviously been a proliferation of consumer

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:39.270
choice in the world. We have to make more
choices and we want to make more choices as,

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:43.720
as the array of stuff that enters our life
and the array of services has grown, so we

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.730
have to be active agents in exploring all
of that.

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:51.061
Income and wealth volatility have increased
in, in particularly in America in the past

00:07:51.061 --> 00:07:56.100
two generations. Job security and job longevity
have decreased; we're cycling through more

00:07:56.100 --> 00:08:00.220
jobs doing more things with ups and downs
in our wealth status, ups and downs in our

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:04.940
income status. We just have to be on top of
more things. The old social contract, as you

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:10.419
know, about somebody l-locking in with an
employer at age 19, living with that employer

00:08:10.419 --> 00:08:16.010
to age 60 or 65, having all his or her needs
met by that employer during the period of

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:20.300
employment and then even post-employment.
That is broken down now in the age of multiple

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:26.700
careers, m-massive churn in the job market
and things like that. That's caused a, an

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:28.350
increase in free agency.

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:33.490
There's a wonderful ro-, book written a couple
of years ago by Daniel Pink who talked about

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:37.959
the rise of the number of Americans who were
on their own in the workplace. Sometimes by

00:08:37.959 --> 00:08:42.019
choice, because they had the tools and the
capacity and the knowledge to do it, and because

00:08:42.019 --> 00:08:46.459
they want to do it. They want to be their
own boss. Some people by circumstances that

00:08:46.459 --> 00:08:50.769
were forced on them; they had to add another
income stream to their life so they did things

00:08:50.769 --> 00:08:55.119
after work in their homes, or they tried to
sell things on the weekend, or they developed

00:08:55.119 --> 00:08:58.279
an EBay or Amazon cont-, account to sell things.

00:08:58.279 --> 00:09:04.351
Overall, Pink added up in about 2001-2002
that there were 35 million people who were

00:09:04.351 --> 00:09:08.699
sole proprietors working on their own businesses
or working in very small family businesses

00:09:08.699 --> 00:09:13.089
that it, that was a doubling of the number
who were in free agency kinds of situations

00:09:13.089 --> 00:09:17.639
a decade before. And there are probably more
still now since we've churned through a recession

00:09:17.639 --> 00:09:22.639
now that is forcing more people to act as
their own agents or supplement their work

00:09:22.639 --> 00:09:27.709
life with other kinds of things that they
do on their own.

00:09:27.709 --> 00:09:31.619
There's been a big change in, in employer
relationships with employees where now employees

00:09:31.619 --> 00:09:35.809
have to take more care of their healthcare
and of their own pensions. Again, when in,

00:09:35.809 --> 00:09:40.230
in that lifetime guarantee of work situation,
the employer would provide the pension, you

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:43.649
served your time in the company, you went
out and the-, and the company kept sending

00:09:43.649 --> 00:09:44.649
you checks.

00:09:44.649 --> 00:09:47.590
That is no longer the case for the majority
of Americans. They have to manage their own

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:51.089
retirement, they have to think about their
own investments, and they have to plan for

00:09:51.089 --> 00:09:54.999
them in ways. So that's forced them to fall
back again into individual strategies rather

00:09:54.999 --> 00:09:57.860
than group strategies to manage their stuff.

00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:02.709
And then finally there is sort of bigger social
ch-, changes outside the realms of, of, of

00:10:02.709 --> 00:10:08.139
people's personal lives that have also prompted
them to become more independent actors in

00:10:08.139 --> 00:10:12.550
the world rather than group actors in the
world. I call this sort of D-I-Y, Do It Yourself

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:17.689
politics and religion even. In a, in colleagues
work that, that's done by the Pew Research

00:10:17.689 --> 00:10:21.990
Center for the people in the press, they do
a lot of political anal-, analyst and their

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:25.449
just down the hall from us. They live in the
same organization that we do.

00:10:25.449 --> 00:10:28.879
They have charted now, for the first time
in the history of polling, that the largest

00:10:28.879 --> 00:10:33.199
block of voters in this country are self-defined
independents. There are more people who say

00:10:33.199 --> 00:10:37.939
now, "I am independent of political parties,"
than say they are attached to either the Democratic

00:10:37.939 --> 00:10:38.959
or the Republican parties.

00:10:38.959 --> 00:10:43.230
We've never seen this before so again, it
may, it's a trend that pushes people more

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:48.129
towards cobbling together their own political
belief system, their own values and structures,

00:10:48.129 --> 00:10:54.980
rather than affiliating with formal institutions.
In religion, amazingly enough, the same trend

00:10:54.980 --> 00:11:00.119
is taking hold. Forty-four percent of Americans,
in a survey that was done by our colleagues

00:11:00.119 --> 00:11:05.629
at the Pew Religion Forum, have changed the
religion of their childhood in the course

00:11:05.629 --> 00:11:11.430
of their adulthood. So 44% of people in America
now are practicing a religion or connecting

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:16.009
to some kind of faith system that is not the
same one that they grew up with and were taught.

00:11:16.009 --> 00:11:21.040
I, people are again sort of mixing and matching
some other belief systems or they're finding

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:25.449
some other places that serve their needs than
the ones that served their parents. Nobody

00:11:25.449 --> 00:11:30.610
has ever done work like that before so I can't
say that that trend is massively greater than

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:34.660
it was in the past. It's probably pretty typically
American compared to lots of other cultures,

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:39.559
but it still goes to show that there are significant
numbers of people who are sort of making it

00:11:39.559 --> 00:11:43.329
up as they go and acting as, as networked
individuals.

00:11:43.329 --> 00:11:48.699
And finally, even before the Internet and
mobile revolution, but certainly accelerated

00:11:48.699 --> 00:11:53.010
by both those revolutions, there's the DIY
health world that we're in. There are a lot

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:58.449
more people now that are acting as, as more
aggressively as the agents of their own healthcare.

00:11:58.449 --> 00:12:03.209
They are looking up stuff. In, in the old,
in the pre-Internet days, in all kinds of

00:12:03.209 --> 00:12:06.480
pamphlets and books and magazines and, and
things like that. Now, of course, they're

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:10.410
turning to the Internet to make sense of the
things that have been told to them about what's

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:15.069
wrong with them or even before they've been
diagnosed to try to figure out what's going

00:12:15.069 --> 00:12:18.989
on in their lives and so that they can become
active agents in their own care.

00:12:18.989 --> 00:12:26.361
In a way that you think of the, the pre-Internet
model of the doctor-patient re-, relationship,

00:12:26.361 --> 00:12:31.889
patient has a couple of meanings in America.
The patient was patient. Sort of waited for

00:12:31.889 --> 00:12:36.160
the doctor to decide after a two minute encounter
everything that was wrong with you and prescribe

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.739
everything for you, right? Well, the, those
patients are not patient anymore. They're

00:12:39.739 --> 00:12:43.009
going out and they're, they're, they're doing
their own searches and they they're walking

00:12:43.009 --> 00:12:47.389
into doctor's offices with lots of printouts
from the Web and saying, "Why not give me

00:12:47.389 --> 00:12:51.369
this drug?" or, "Why didn't you tell me about
this side effect?" or, "Why didn't you tell

00:12:51.369 --> 00:12:55.329
me about this clinic that is giving a new
experimental treatment on this?"

00:12:55.329 --> 00:12:59.819
So people again are being much more active
in managing the central affairs of their life.

00:12:59.819 --> 00:13:04.279
That's the hallmark of network individualism.
And, of course, technology enters the picture

00:13:04.279 --> 00:13:09.649
and puts everything that has already come
before it on steroids. All of the trends that

00:13:09.649 --> 00:13:15.490
were in evidence in the 1960s, 70s, and 80s,
before the, the Internet was mass adopted

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:21.610
and before mobile phones became staples of
people's lives, are now sort of intensified

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:25.850
in all of these ways. And it's particularly
true of those who are under age 30.

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:30.860
The people that we call "millennials", the
people who have grown up in a, in respect,

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:36.020
in a world where it was not possible to know
a world without the Internet. And increasingly,

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:40.060
not to know a world without cell phones and
mobile connectivity built into it. People

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:45.989
are now acting as these, as, as networked
individuals in ways that they couldn't have

00:13:45.989 --> 00:13:49.790
before they had these technology tools available
to them.

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:54.720
Quickly, to orient you about the dimensions
of the, of the tech revolution, when we went

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:58.920
into business, we were sort of in the midway.
We went in to, we did our first survey in

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:05.519
March of 2000, so we were sort of midway through
the mass adoption period of the consumer Internet.

00:14:05.519 --> 00:14:10.971
The first survey we did in March of 2000,
46% of adults used the Internet, 73% of teenagers

00:14:10.971 --> 00:14:18.110
used the Internet. Now, it's 75% of adults
and 93% of teenagers. It's important to remember

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:22.439
as you are, are thinking about that, that's,
that's an incredible growth story and it's

00:14:22.439 --> 00:14:27.489
an incredible adoption story that in some
sense is unparalleled in, in the sort of mass

00:14:27.489 --> 00:14:32.620
consumer goods, but it's still the case that
25% of Americans don't use the Internet.

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:37.069
They are older, they are less well-educated,
they have fewer resources available to them.

00:14:37.069 --> 00:14:42.059
They are likely to have a handicap, a, a,
or a disability and in America they're much

00:14:42.059 --> 00:14:46.739
less likely to feel comfortable speaking English
as their primary language. We do our survey

00:14:46.739 --> 00:14:50.170
work both in English and Spanish and we ask
at the very beginning, "How would you like

00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:54.679
to take the survey?" The people who choose
to take the survey in Spanish are less likely,

00:14:54.679 --> 00:14:58.309
statistically, significantly, to be Internet
users than those who are comfortable with

00:14:58.309 --> 00:14:59.410
English. Yeah?

00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:06.225
&gt;&gt;audience1: Yeah, I was going to ask about
the 7%, not the 25%. What about the 7%--

00:15:06.225 --> 00:15:07.225
&gt;&gt;Lee: The 7--

00:15:07.225 --> 00:15:08.225
&gt;&gt;audience1: of teenagers [inaudible]

00:15:08.225 --> 00:15:10.649
&gt;&gt;Lee: The seven percent of teenagers who
do not use the Internet are mostly lower income

00:15:10.649 --> 00:15:15.259
or rural. Some, some are, have handicaps but
in many cases it's available at their schools

00:15:15.259 --> 00:15:21.540
or local libraries and they just are, aren't
comfortable with it or aren't happy to say

00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:27.249
that they are an Internet user. They often
will use their friends to do key communications

00:15:27.249 --> 00:15:31.319
for them like texting, emailing, or something
like that. They will often have their friends

00:15:31.319 --> 00:15:36.079
do searches for them but they don't classify
themselves as Internet users so it-, there's

00:15:36.079 --> 00:15:39.699
a bit of a knowledge issue; there's definitely
a resource issue. They are poorer than the

00:15:39.699 --> 00:15:43.879
rest of Americans; they're much more likely
to be rural.

00:15:43.879 --> 00:15:48.410
This, this sort of second way that we've seen
in, incredible change in the Internet is that

00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:52.920
in that first survey we asked a, about broadband
connections. Less than 5% of Americans had

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:58.079
broadband connections. Now 62% of Americans
have them at home. So the Internet experience

00:15:58.079 --> 00:16:02.670
at home now is high-speed, always on, it's
not great high-speed but it's, it's a very

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:07.049
different experience from the dial-up experience
and in our research we consistently see the

00:16:07.049 --> 00:16:11.730
people who convert from dial-up to broadband
become vastly different kinds of Internet

00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:15.120
users. They are, they build it more into the
rhythms of their lives, they care about it

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:19.439
more, they're on it more, they like the outcomes
of their Internu-, Internet use better and

00:16:19.439 --> 00:16:24.980
it is, it is transforming even yet again as
premium services come online and as places

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:27.870
like yours are offering speeds up to a, a,
a, a gigabit.

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:33.189
At the time we were, we first went into business,
half the c-, adults in the country had cell

00:16:33.189 --> 00:16:38.579
phones; now 80% do. At the time we went into
existence, we didn't even ask a question about

00:16:38.579 --> 00:16:42.619
wireless connectivity. It was only something
that people with the most sophisticated equipment

00:16:42.619 --> 00:16:45.279
could possibly do, is connect to the Internet
wirelessly.

00:16:45.279 --> 00:16:51.269
Now, we find that 53% of, of people connect
either through wireless cards in there, their

00:16:51.269 --> 00:16:57.100
laptops or portable computers, or through
their handheld devices. About a third of cell

00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:00.499
phone owners now connect to the Internet through
their cell phones. And in some respects, it's

00:17:00.499 --> 00:17:04.490
changing the nature of the digital divide
because they're disproportionately minorities.

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:08.350
They are more likely to be Hispanic or African
American than they are to be white and so

00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:13.329
the digital divide even for non-Internet users
is shrinking a bit because mobile connectivity

00:17:13.329 --> 00:17:16.089
is bringing more people on-, online.

00:17:16.089 --> 00:17:21.459
And, of course, we didn-, we didn-, we don't
ask cloud questions in 2000 and we don't ask

00:17:21.459 --> 00:17:25.470
a consistent battery of cloud questions because
it's really hard to capture and people don't

00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:29.550
quite know whether they're on the cloud or
not. But it's eas-, it's sort of easier to

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:36.340
say that there were very few people who had
like Webmail accounts in 2000 and now probably

00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:40.669
over two-thirds use cloud computing functions
in one way, shape, or another.

00:17:40.669 --> 00:17:45.429
Fifty-seven percent, as I'll tell you later,
57% of Internet users now are social networkers,

00:17:45.429 --> 00:17:49.420
which is all taking place in the cloud. So,
the environment that we measured just in the

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:55.000
life of the project in ten years has gone
from slow connections through wires to my

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:01.580
computer to fast mobile connections through
somebody else's server and that has changed

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:05.539
peoples relationship to information and changed
their relationship to other people and again,

00:18:05.539 --> 00:18:10.730
made them more performing like networked individuals.

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:15.919
One of the things that networked individuals
do in, in, in this environment over time,

00:18:15.919 --> 00:18:20.100
is that they change the composition of their
networks. One of the things that we've seen

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:27.820
in the life of the project is that, that networks
are now bigger than they used to be, depending

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:32.279
on how you classify it. They're looser in
the sense that there are probably not that

00:18:32.279 --> 00:18:35.851
many more tight-knit friends that people will
describe in their networks, but there are

00:18:35.851 --> 00:18:41.269
many more loose connections, weak ties, or
even sort of very distant ties in people's

00:18:41.269 --> 00:18:46.919
lives with whom they can interact and from
whom they can solicit support and offer support

00:18:46.919 --> 00:18:47.919
if they want to.

00:18:47.919 --> 00:18:52.590
And so, the networks have expanded in really
interesting ways, particularly in that more

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:56.909
casual realm as people can maintain their
relationships with others pretty easily with

00:18:56.909 --> 00:19:01.390
technology rather than having to phone call
somebody all the time or make appointments

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:06.100
to meet them. It's just easier to have these
relationships have meaning, even in a very

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:08.330
casual sense because technology is used.

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:14.280
Layers of, networks have become more segmented.
People now, this is the essence of networked

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:18.669
individuals and people have portions of their
network that they consult depending on the

00:19:18.669 --> 00:19:22.840
needs that they have in their life and the
needs that others express to them.

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:25.409
So that some people, think about your own
networks. If you had a financial problem,

00:19:25.409 --> 00:19:28.820
there are probably a couple of people in your
network that you'd ping to help you answer

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:32.659
questions or solve problems and that. They'd
be different from the people you would consult

00:19:32.659 --> 00:19:36.760
if you had a health problem, who would still
yet be different if you had a spiritual or

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:38.059
emotional problem in your life.

00:19:38.059 --> 00:19:43.029
So, we're now segmenting our layers based
on functionality, on people's closeness to

00:19:43.029 --> 00:19:48.380
you, on your need, and at the time of your
need. And so this networked invi-, individualism

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:54.799
environment is one where people are more liberated
than they were in the past. Now that social

00:19:54.799 --> 00:19:59.139
atmosphere of the small town where everybody
was connected to everybody else and your mom

00:19:59.139 --> 00:20:04.149
could tell everybody else what was going on
with you and they'd discipline you too. That

00:20:04.149 --> 00:20:08.871
has been broken apart and it's more liberating.
People have more maneuvering room than they

00:20:08.871 --> 00:20:13.630
used to, to get through, negotiate life and
not have every element of their business known

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:18.110
by everybody in there, in their network. So,
they, in some sense, most people would say,

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:19.970
"That's a, that's not a bad thing."

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:24.470
The same time, the social safety net that
they had in that world of tight networks is

00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:29.470
a bit more frayed. They can't depend on a
cl-, small cluster of people always to anticipate

00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:33.429
their needs, always to meet them where they,
where they needed to, or always to call on

00:20:33.429 --> 00:20:38.259
them when they had needs. So people have to
work harder in this environment to get their

00:20:38.259 --> 00:20:43.331
needs met. And one of the, the, they do two
things connected to, to social networking

00:20:43.331 --> 00:20:46.380
that matter a lot, particularly in the context
of this company.

00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:51.100
The first is they use their social networks
more to, to do a lot more things for them

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:56.400
and as people are in an environment, for instance,
that is full of data coming at them; full

00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:01.110
of inputs, full of media, fu-, just, you know,
information overload is the standard way we

00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:06.299
talk about this. The primary coping strategy
that people use in that is to turn to their

00:21:06.299 --> 00:21:10.600
networks; to help them filter information,
to help them curate information, to help them

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:15.710
assess information. And if you encounter lots
of information after you've done queries in

00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:21.330
the world and you're not quite sure what weight
to give what fact, people turn to their net-,

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:25.100
to their networks, particularly the experts
in their networks to help them make sense

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:26.269
of all that they've got.

00:21:26.269 --> 00:21:30.860
And then the new feature of networks is that
the, particularly those outer rings of networks,

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:34.929
they become an audience for social networkers.
They can become people that you broadcast

00:21:34.929 --> 00:21:40.429
to if you have a social network site or profile.
They can be people if you have a blog that

00:21:40.429 --> 00:21:45.490
you can tell your story to without necessarily
having it be a reciprocal relationship or

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:49.220
having, expecting anything back from them
other than their attention and their care

00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:54.440
and every once in a blue moon maybe answering
things that you have to do.

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:58.929
So why, let me just stop there, it, it's,
it's my one sort of filibuster pause moment

00:21:58.929 --> 00:22:02.520
to make sure that, that one part of the data
dump that I've gone through makes sense to

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:05.659
you. Just, it mostly makes sense? Ok, good.

00:22:05.659 --> 00:22:11.520
So I'll quickly run through now eight ways
that I think the information ecosystem has

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:16.190
changed. Thanks, in, in great measure to,
to folks like you and company, companies like

00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:21.390
this and why that matters in the context of,
of the way people think about and use their

00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:23.720
social networking, their social networks.

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:27.390
The, obviously, the first one is that the
volume of information itself has increased.

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:31.720
There is just more stuff being generated in
more ways, flowing into people's lives, in

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:35.600
an ambient environment where they can connect
to the Internet everywhere. It literally is

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:40.511
all around them and people begin to think
of it as all around them. And in some sense,

00:22:40.511 --> 00:22:41.511
that's great.

00:22:41.511 --> 00:22:47.940
Americans say they like lots of information,
lots of choice. They don't want to have restrictions

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:53.669
or, or limits placed on it. On the same s-,
side of the coin though, it's, it's disorienting

00:22:53.669 --> 00:22:58.870
to have that much stuff endlessly pouring
at you and have a sense that an even bigger

00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:03.909
sense, wa-, waves are, are coming past the
one that the tsunami that's already hitting

00:23:03.909 --> 00:23:07.421
you. So the sense that I can master maybe
stuff today but God knows what's going to

00:23:07.421 --> 00:23:10.019
happen tomorrow as more stuff flows into my
life.

00:23:10.019 --> 00:23:14.500
So that's, th-, the volume of information
and, and, and the sense that people have about

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:18.970
its meaning to their life is disorienting
and, and sometimes exciting, but oftentimes

00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:20.700
a, a big challenge.

00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:25.929
The second way the ecosystem has changed is
that the variety of sources of information

00:23:25.929 --> 00:23:29.620
have proliferated. Obviously, when you have
more cable ch-, channels to watch, more websites

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:34.460
to go to, more search engines to choose from,
and so many, and more gadgets to display them

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:39.220
all on, people have a sense that they are
now encountering more information from more

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:43.890
places, more people, more points of view than
they used to before. It's not necessarily

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:47.019
the case that they're taking advantage of
it. You know there are a lot of people who

00:23:47.019 --> 00:23:53.780
are narrowing their information universe,
using new tools, to, to, to get the information

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:57.909
that mostly lines up with the information
they, or the world as they see it or the belief

00:23:57.909 --> 00:24:02.100
system if they have it. But it's still the
case that there is just more stuff out there

00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:06.440
that adds to the sense that the volume is
growing. And, and new creators are obviously

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:07.840
coming on the scene every day.

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:14.639
Right now, we basically add up all the ways
people can create content online and our,

00:24:14.639 --> 00:24:19.649
our rough guess is that about two-thirds of
adults and three-quarters teenagers are content

00:24:19.649 --> 00:24:23.799
creators. They have done one, at least one
thing and usually multiple things that have

00:24:23.799 --> 00:24:29.290
pushed out content for others to see and share
online. And that just changed the way that

00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:32.559
they act in networks and changed the way that
they maintain their networks in a variety

00:24:32.559 --> 00:24:33.559
of ways.

00:24:33.559 --> 00:24:38.809
Just quickly running down and more than half
of Internet users now, adult, adults, are

00:24:38.809 --> 00:24:43.620
social network site users. Three-quarters
of teenagers, more than three-quarters of

00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:49.009
twenty-something's use social networking sites.
About half of adults and about three-quarters

00:24:49.009 --> 00:24:50.580
of teenagers share photos online.

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:55.909
It-, and the people who do that are really
different social beings than the people who

00:24:55.909 --> 00:24:59.250
don't share pictures online. They are just
more engaged with their friends, they know

00:24:59.250 --> 00:25:03.500
more about their friends, they're confident
that their friends know more about them and,

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:08.610
and in picture sharing itself is a special
networking activity that wasn't really afforded

00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:13.289
in the days before the Internet. About a third
share personal creations of one kind or another.

00:25:13.289 --> 00:25:17.179
They've, they've composed something, they've
written something, they've drawn a piece of

00:25:17.179 --> 00:25:18.509
art and they share it online.

00:25:18.509 --> 00:25:24.460
About a third now contribute to rankings and
gradings online. They've posted comments,

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:28.549
they've done a thumbs-up or thumbs-down on
the star rating system. We consider that,

00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:32.250
its simple content creation, but it's still
then still contributing their sense of what's

00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:38.289
going on to the world. About a quarter have
created content tags and, and left them up

00:25:38.289 --> 00:25:40.200
for others to see.

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:44.879
About another quarter posts comments on sites
and blogs so that they think of themselves

00:25:44.879 --> 00:25:48.669
as participators in the news environment,
in the health environment, in the politics

00:25:48.669 --> 00:25:50.899
and civics environment, in all kinds of places.

00:25:50.899 --> 00:25:57.330
About 20 percent of, of adults are Twitter
users. I-, compared to only about eight percent

00:25:57.330 --> 00:26:01.070
of teenagers. Twitter is not for teenagers,
it's for twenty-something's, and even more

00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:06.309
for thirty-something's a-, and forty-something's.
Fifteen percent of people still have a personal

00:26:06.309 --> 00:26:10.779
website. Fifteen percent of people s-, are
content remixers. They find things online,

00:26:10.779 --> 00:26:15.950
pictures, music, videos, and other things,
they, they play around with it in one shape

00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:20.740
or form and then push it back out for the
others to enjoy. So they're, the remix culture

00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:24.879
is very alive and well on the Internet. And
about 14% are bloggers.

00:26:24.879 --> 00:26:30.290
There is one sort of special dimension to
new data that I thought would be important

00:26:30.290 --> 00:26:33.919
to the, the YouTube folks who are watching
or in the room. We're just about to put out

00:26:33.919 --> 00:26:39.071
some new data on, on video sharing and video
use online. Now, for the first time in our

00:26:39.071 --> 00:26:44.700
measurements, more than half of American adults,
more than two-thirds of Internet users have

00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:50.860
consumed or downloaded video online and 14%
share videos. They up, upload them. And we

00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:56.120
have some data in there showing up, the meaning
of those, of those uploads and, and the purposes

00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:59.810
for which people do them and they, who they
think the audience is for those, for those

00:26:59.810 --> 00:27:04.279
videos. And interestingly enough, we're just
beginning to capture the earliest phase of

00:27:04.279 --> 00:27:06.809
a number that I know is going to grow over
time.

00:27:06.809 --> 00:27:12.600
Eight percent of Internet users have watched
Internet programming on their TVs. They plug

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:17.180
their, their computer stuff, or they plug
a USB device into their TVs and now the TV

00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:22.430
is increasingly likely to be a hub of all
kinds of content, not just broadcasting cable

00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:28.629
content. So that, that's the end of the second
part of the, the ecosystem change, content

00:27:28.629 --> 00:27:31.279
creation and visibility of creators.

00:27:31.279 --> 00:27:35.559
The third change is that people's vigilance
has changed. The, the v-patterns of my words

00:27:35.559 --> 00:27:40.559
might be coming clear to you, clear to you
now. That's my word for attention. And attention

00:27:40.559 --> 00:27:43.629
is actually changing in two directions in
this environment.

00:27:43.629 --> 00:27:47.740
The most obvious one, an-, and the one that
gets the most cultural commentary is, is it's

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:54.220
getting truncated. Multitasking has now collapsed.
Lots a-, lots of people's attention into short,

00:27:54.220 --> 00:28:01.590
little snack type bites and there's less deliberate,
purposeful, long-term engagement with content

00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:02.590
than before.

00:28:02.590 --> 00:28:08.190
You might have heard my wonderful friend's
idea, Linda Stone, Technology Consultant,

00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:13.629
who has worked in a variety of places; talks
about us all living our lives in a state of

00:28:13.629 --> 00:28:19.090
continuous partial attention. Where every
device we have in our lives is constantly

00:28:19.090 --> 00:28:24.610
on and constantly capable of, of interrupting
us. And she worries about the stress that

00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:28.870
that creates in our life. I hear from people
in business contexts that that's the only

00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:32.580
way to live. You've got to be on the grid,
you've got to make sure that you're available

00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:38.330
for interventions from bosses and clients
and customers and even competitors and it's,

00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:40.679
it's not something that you have discretion
over.

00:28:40.679 --> 00:28:45.299
So, attention is getting truncated, but it's
also getting elongated in this world. This

00:28:45.299 --> 00:28:52.559
is great age of, of amateur experts. If you
want to get a, a, an experts gain and expertise

00:28:52.559 --> 00:28:57.020
in a subject that you didn't care about a
year ago, a week ago, or a month ago, you

00:28:57.020 --> 00:29:01.970
can do it now, thanks to the wonderful tools
and the wonderful content that's available

00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:02.970
online.

00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:07.509
And so, the healthcare example is a primary
example of how people who didn't know that

00:29:07.509 --> 00:29:12.879
they or a loved one had a condition yesterday,
did find out and now are anxious to become

00:29:12.879 --> 00:29:16.509
the world-class expert on that subject and
can do it in this environment. They can access

00:29:16.509 --> 00:29:21.120
clinical trials, they can get the same kind
of medical literature that their specialist

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:25.410
provider provides them. There are people who
worry about this, too. I mean, it, the, the,

00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:30.340
the, the age of the amateur expert is fr-,
makes people worried that you guys probably

00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:31.620
hear from a lot.

00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:34.830
Well, this has destroyed this traditional
structures of gate keeping in our culture

00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:39.420
that used to do careful editing and careful
fact-checking and, and make sure that the

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:43.559
best, most highest-quality information that's
filtered through the system before it was

00:29:43.559 --> 00:29:47.490
disseminated, now any knucklehead can, can
put out anything and make it look halfway

00:29:47.490 --> 00:29:52.960
credible and stuff. And there's a lot of cultural
commotion about whether this is good or not.

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:57.740
Andrew Keen wrote a book called "The Cult
of the Amateur" wh-, that sort of codified

00:29:57.740 --> 00:30:01.749
this argument that we're not doing ourselves
any favor by adding so many more voices from

00:30:01.749 --> 00:30:05.900
so many other points of view with so little
credentialing a, ba-, supporting them and

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:10.019
so few processes sometimes supporting their
information. So it's just, a, you know, I'm

00:30:10.019 --> 00:30:13.580
not going to settle that argument. We don't
take positions on things, but it's certainly

00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:18.559
true that attention is, is splaying out in
both directions in this environment thanks

00:30:18.559 --> 00:30:20.350
to technology.

00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:24.169
The four changes of velocity of information
is changing; and it, it, and the way that

00:30:24.169 --> 00:30:29.870
this most dramatically shows up in our data
is, is not so much big stories that we all

00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:34.659
find out really quickly when big news happens,
like the, the, the Gulf of Mexico oil spill,

00:30:34.659 --> 00:30:41.330
or the, or, or the earth-, or the Times Square
attempted terror bombing. We always have found

00:30:41.330 --> 00:30:45.250
out about that stuff in the age of TV. We've
found out relatively quickly about that. What's

00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:50.610
different about this age is the middle tier
of information that matters mostly to us.

00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:55.150
The velocity of that information is what's
picked up and been disorienting to people

00:30:55.150 --> 00:31:00.909
in this environment. Think of the ways that
they set up alerts, and RSS streams, and they

00:31:00.909 --> 00:31:06.600
use listservs and things to gather up information
on the subjects and policies and personalities

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:09.059
and, and hobbies that matter to them.

00:31:09.059 --> 00:31:14.139
Now, all this stuff floods in to their life,
not necessarily in real time, but close to

00:31:14.139 --> 00:31:18.520
real time in ways that it never used to before.
They used to have to subscribe to specialty

00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:22.499
publications or go to specialty meetings to
learn about new things that are happening.

00:31:22.499 --> 00:31:27.899
Now that in-, information input is coming
in relatively quickly. And about half or more

00:31:27.899 --> 00:31:32.649
Internet users have set up some sort of way
to, to participate in groups online and learn

00:31:32.649 --> 00:31:33.820
about this middle information.

00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:35.090
[audience chatter]

00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:39.259
The fifth change is that venues and availability
of information have changed. It used to be

00:31:39.259 --> 00:31:43.030
that we had appointments with media. We watched
certain TV shows at certain times that they

00:31:43.030 --> 00:31:48.330
were on; we watched on the different platforms
that they were made available on that, that,

00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:52.429
we did it on a schedule that they gave us.
Well now, in the era of mobile connectivity

00:31:52.429 --> 00:31:57.000
devices that give us media anytime and anywhere,
we are in charge of the playlist.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:03.490
We are watching TV on something other than
a traditional TV. We're reading newspapers

00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:09.639
on something other than traditional newspapers
and it's rebalanced the relationship the people

00:32:09.639 --> 00:32:14.279
who used to be the producers and articulators
of the scheduling of the information and the

00:32:14.279 --> 00:32:18.559
consumers, who now have much more control,
not only of, of when they're going to encounter

00:32:18.559 --> 00:32:23.549
media, but their capacity to, to contribute
to media.

00:32:23.549 --> 00:32:27.559
The sixth change is the vibrance of information
has changed, too. The immersive qualities

00:32:27.559 --> 00:32:32.269
of information in this age has gotten a lot
better as computing power, bandwidth has grown,

00:32:32.269 --> 00:32:38.090
th-,even the pixels we can display have become
more tightly packed and more colorful. There

00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:43.640
are now more engaging worlds, particularly
in the gaming environment, but also in all

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:49.040
kinds of, of, in virtual spaces that are pretty
compelling, and pretty interesting and pretty

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:54.669
connected to what, what interest's people.
I would argue that, y-, that, that, that this

00:32:54.669 --> 00:32:58.950
company in particular is at the forefront
of true trends that we are going to be measuring

00:32:58.950 --> 00:33:03.950
a lot in the coming, in the coming years just
because they speak to this issue of the, of

00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:08.539
the vibrance of information--augmented reality.
I mean, we're just packing more stuff as we

00:33:08.539 --> 00:33:13.309
merge the virtual and real worlds with data
on top of, of real artifacts and real landscapes

00:33:13.309 --> 00:33:14.309
and things.

00:33:14.309 --> 00:33:18.330
People are en-, engaging most spaces now in
different ways in the mobile environment and

00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:23.929
we'll do so even more still as more information
gets packed in, more knowledge gets embedded

00:33:23.929 --> 00:33:28.200
in artifacts and as the apps get better. It's
just, it's just that simple and of course,

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:32.990
Mirror Worlds, you guys have given us the
iconic example of that in, in Google Earth.

00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:37.499
It just, these are just powerful tools now
where stuff that we know and we experience

00:33:37.499 --> 00:33:43.679
can be embedded into representations of the
real world. I, that makes people more capable

00:33:43.679 --> 00:33:47.600
of being actors in that real world in the
sense of, of network individualism.

00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:53.320
The seventh change is the balance of information
has gotten better. We find more stuff that

00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:57.080
is relevant to us than ever before, thanks
in large part because search engines are doing

00:33:57.080 --> 00:34:03.179
such a wonderful job at that. The Semantic
Web mi-, might be even better at, at, at giving

00:34:03.179 --> 00:34:07.240
us information like that, but even in simple
forms now about half of Internet users, in

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:12.060
one way, shape, or form, customize information
flows into them. They, they set up RSS feeds,

00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:16.820
they, they customize a web page, they build,
they belong to listservs or other kinds of

00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:23.150
groups that act as sentries and, and information
sources for them on the particular things

00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:24.390
that they care about.

00:34:24.390 --> 00:34:25.530
[audience chatter]

00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:28.240
The final change is in voting and ventilation
about in-, information is, well, actually

00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:29.350
let me take your question now. Yeah.

00:34:29.350 --> 00:34:32.540
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 2: Would you say the [inaudible]

00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:42.240
&gt;&gt;Lee: It, well collectively it's about half
of Internet users have done one thing or another

00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:47.010
that customizes flows of information into
their life at least a part of the time. It's

00:34:47.010 --> 00:34:53.270
alerts, it's streams, it's, it's the web plate
configuration, you know, stuff like that.

00:34:53.270 --> 00:35:00.130
And, and we even count listserv users if they
are of a certain kind who are active within

00:35:00.130 --> 00:35:03.330
their group and are depending on that group
to feed them information about the subject

00:35:03.330 --> 00:35:09.460
that the group was formed around. It's probably,
I probably, if you're being skeptical about

00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:12.770
that number, I appreciate you're skeptical
and n-, n-, no, I think it's probably a little

00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:13.770
low.

00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:19.180
I think if we actually did real close observational
work, we'd see a lot more people even using

00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:24.350
mental strategies, not just technological
strategies to customize the flow of information.

00:35:24.350 --> 00:35:28.190
And you know there's a lot of interesting
research now coming out of the scholarly community

00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:33.090
about people being more strategic readers
now than they used to be. And they're the

00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:39.070
strategies, literally eye scan tests, have
shown how they parsed all the stuff that they

00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:43.340
need to much more rapidly now and, and their
interesting ways that they make choices to

00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:47.420
read more deeply in the certain things that,
that seem to be interesting or relevant or,

00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:50.690
or breakthroughs in their fields. Is that,
is that helpful?

00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:55.430
&gt;&gt;Audience2: [inaudible]

00:35:55.430 --> 00:36:10.300
&gt;&gt;Lee: Yeah, it's, I think, the way we think
about it is, is two completely things. Whe-,

00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:15.360
I, in the, when I'm talking about the relevance
of information, I'm talking about strategies

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:19.630
that people deliberately set up to use so
that they can get access to the content that

00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:24.990
matters to them. In the context of content
creation, social networking, and stuff like

00:36:24.990 --> 00:36:28.540
that, people are doing other things with that.
In some sense they're, they're, they're depending

00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:32.751
on their networks to be sentries and information
filters for them, but there are a lot of other

00:36:32.751 --> 00:36:35.970
reasons that people have participated in that
universe as well. They want to share their

00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:41.110
lives, they want to do touch points with people
in their network, they want to see what's

00:36:41.110 --> 00:36:45.860
going on in people's lives. That maybe isn't
relative or relevant to particular things

00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:48.720
they care about but they like that person
and they want to know what that person had

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:51.990
for lunch or where that person is going on
vacation. So it's, it's measuring two sl-,

00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:58.010
different things. They're not, I, I don't
see them as in conflict.

00:36:58.010 --> 00:37:03.930
And so the, the, the eighth point is that
voting and ventilation about information is

00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:10.150
proliferating as people tag content and comment.
And, and when we did some work looking at

00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:14.830
how people use news sites and one of the things
we found is that a, a primary marker for people

00:37:14.830 --> 00:37:19.260
of a trustworthy news site now is the ability
to comment and read other people's comments

00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:24.300
about news stories. As toxic as they are,
and as incendiary as lots of the commenting

00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:30.310
is on media sites, people still think that
that's now a new element of, of, of trust

00:37:30.310 --> 00:37:33.910
that they have with that organization and,
and, and a willingness of that organization

00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:35.130
to be transparent.

00:37:35.130 --> 00:37:39.190
A lot of people don't care what's on, on the
content of the comments but they like the

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:43.090
fact that they're there and they like the
fact that there is available interactivity.

00:37:43.090 --> 00:37:48.790
So, what is all this technology done to networks,
particularly to millennials, the people who

00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:53.590
are under 30 and are again living in this
life? For the first, most obvious, thing to

00:37:53.590 --> 00:37:58.880
say about it is that it's made networks more
vivid for people. They actually have a physical

00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:02.380
sense of their social networks that their
parents, their grandparents, and their other

00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:08.230
ancestors never had in part because the technology,
in many cases, displays the networks for them

00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:12.290
and allows them to see what is going on and
stay in touch in ways that they never could

00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:18.270
before. So, networks themselves in people's
lives are reified. They're, they're made human

00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:23.800
in ways that they, that they weren't before.
A-, this technology has allowed for immediate

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:26.660
ad hoc creation of networks.

00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:31.510
Maybe you're familiar with the wonderful,
well, two actual wonderful books, Clay Shirky's

00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:37.281
book, "Here Comes Everybody", and Howard Rheingold's
book, "Smart Mobs". People f-, in this environment,

00:38:37.281 --> 00:38:43.280
form networks to them solve problems on the
fly. A lot of times their networks are permanent

00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:47.700
people, but in many cases when people have
a simple need to answer a question, or a simple

00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:52.580
query, or something like that, they will just
sort of ping their network in the broadest

00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:53.580
sense.

00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:56.050
They'll post it on Facebook, they'll tw-,
they'll tweet it, they'll stick it on their

00:38:56.050 --> 00:39:00.630
blog and they, and th-, the crowd will answer
their question or, or the crowd will give

00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:06.780
them input and that's, the network assembles
for that purpose and then disbands. And that's

00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:11.480
the sort of new function in networks that
is enabled by these technologies. These networks

00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:17.680
have added more segments, as I described before,
especially related to communities of interest.

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:22.790
And one of the most striking things, again,
that we see in our health research is the

00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:28.580
power of network, social network segments
that we call, "just in time, just like me"

00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:33.180
networks. Where people that have a particular
need… I've just been diagnosed, what's it

00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:37.680
like? Or, I've got a, I've got an appointment
at the doctors. Can someone drive me there?

00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:43.730
I, my child is, has got this. My dad needs
this kind of care. And people, who are, in

00:39:43.730 --> 00:39:48.450
many cases, strangers in, in the right spaces
under the right circumstances, will answer

00:39:48.450 --> 00:39:52.530
their questions based on their particular
parallel circumstances.

00:39:52.530 --> 00:39:57.280
There is a special power in that, in networks,
even though it, they might be taking place

00:39:57.280 --> 00:40:04.180
between strangers because wer-, when people
are in situations of acute need, they mostly

00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:09.740
like to hear from people who have gone through
the same thing and are mostly like them. So,

00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:15.040
it, it, even more so than family members who
might offer words of comfort, or are trusted

00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:20.260
friends like a minister who might offer words
of wisdom or words of counsel, if you can

00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:24.910
find the mother who has gone through has gone
through the exact same thing with roughly

00:40:24.910 --> 00:40:29.730
the same age child that you're going through,
there's a special power and meaning that,

00:40:29.730 --> 00:40:32.070
that is brought out by these new kinds of
networks.

00:40:32.070 --> 00:40:40.300
This new technology has made the act of media
making a part of networking activity. Media

00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:47.860
now are, are literally active agents in, in
people's networks. I get knowing nods when

00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:52.670
I go out and speak to the world and I speak
to journalistic groups and library groups

00:40:52.670 --> 00:41:00.390
and media companies and, and non-profits of
all kinds when I say," Think about th-, your

00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:05.630
networks. Think about this point in the following
way: Do you use Google as a tie or a node

00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:06.630
in your network?"

00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:07.630
[male voice from audience]

00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:11.620
And people will nod yes. That they will, when
they have a need, it's particularly obvious,

00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:16.220
it starts with an information query, but if
they know that their network can't solve it

00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:19.690
or if it's something embarrassing that they
don't want to share with their network, or

00:41:19.690 --> 00:41:23.740
if it's at a time of day when they don't want
to bother anybody in their network, they will

00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:28.850
turn to the Internet, generically, but often
to a search engine like Google to begin the

00:41:28.850 --> 00:41:33.940
process of finding out what's going on, how
can I cope with it, where can I the support

00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:34.940
that I need.

00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:41.320
So media itself, the Internet sort of generically,
and search engines in particular, are active

00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:45.410
agents now in people's networks that they
consult as they, as they have done, as people

00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:48.310
have always done with their networks which
is to solve problems, make decisions, and

00:41:48.310 --> 00:41:51.490
gain support that they need.

00:41:51.490 --> 00:41:58.360
That means that organizations can now be much
more active agents in people's networks than

00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:04.230
they ever used to. And since media now is
personal and social, even organizations that

00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:09.780
are using these media are in people's minds
now; sort of nodes in their networks. If they

00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:15.540
have a question they want resolved they are
as happy to turn to a helpful institution

00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:20.160
like a library, like a search engine, like
a non-profit that might be able to give them

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:24.360
a, r-, information about resources in their
community, and think of that as an active

00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:25.360
agent in their network.

00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:28.732
And when we ask people about how they solve
problems and how they get their information

00:42:28.732 --> 00:42:33.970
needs met, we often find that they consult
three or four different types of media, different

00:42:33.970 --> 00:42:40.090
types of people. And media themselves now
are active players in that segmenting of,

00:42:40.090 --> 00:42:46.170
of social networking, markets, and information
queries. And finally, the big change, s-,

00:42:46.170 --> 00:42:52.070
one of the big changes in networks that has
been brought upon by, by technology, is that

00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:57.581
consequential strangers and, and that outer
layer of a network can be much more active

00:42:57.581 --> 00:43:01.310
players in people's networks as they are trying
to a-, have questions answered.

00:43:01.310 --> 00:43:04.921
You don't have to know somebody intimately
to ask for their help and in this environment

00:43:04.921 --> 00:43:09.790
get somebody's help back. It's just me-, meant,
th-, that again that people added another

00:43:09.790 --> 00:43:14.490
layer or two to their social networks because
they can count on the goodness of strangers

00:43:14.490 --> 00:43:19.530
in many cases, or count on the attention of
strangers as they are trying to negotiate

00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:22.400
the world.

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:26.830
The generational story in this is, is pretty
interesting. It's, i-, it, it, those who have

00:43:26.830 --> 00:43:32.880
grown up with these technologies are i-, add
20% to all the data points I gave you before

00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:37.230
if you want to talk about people under age
30. They are much more active, much more filtering,

00:43:37.230 --> 00:43:43.700
much more engaged, much more likely to be
concerned about things than, than their elders.

00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:47.930
They are the ones who, and now, obviously
live in a network environment and think of

00:43:47.930 --> 00:43:52.880
the network as this sort of dashboard of their,
not only of the Internet to them, but of their

00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:58.740
social world. They check in constantly, they
monitor constantly, they feel they themselves

00:43:58.740 --> 00:44:02.760
are being monitored constantly; many of them
think now that they have an obligation to

00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:07.350
their networks to post material, to update
where they are and what's going on and post

00:44:07.350 --> 00:44:09.160
pictures and, and things like that.

00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:14.810
So, so, the people now who are under 30 have
a much more expansive sense about what social

00:44:14.810 --> 00:44:18.610
networks can mean and what they, what role
that they play in people's lives, which doesn't

00:44:18.610 --> 00:44:22.740
mean that they don't care about privacy and
sharing and, and all the, the issues related

00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:30.840
to that. It just means they have a different
sense of it and they have a, a sort of a logic

00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:34.990
of life that grows out of first, their use
of the Internet, and now the use of their

00:44:34.990 --> 00:44:39.440
mobile phones. That I want to be in touch,
I want to be perpetually in contact because

00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:43.740
that's what these technologies allow me to
be. And that's kind of fun because I like

00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:48.340
my friends, I like to, to be engaged with
my friends.

00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:52.790
And I'm finally going to run through a, a
bunch of questions that we wrestle with which

00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:56.920
sort of the, a series of questions about the
dark side, or issues about the dark side of

00:44:56.920 --> 00:45:00.100
all this life because it's a, it's a pretty
rosy picture that I've been painting because

00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:02.860
people like it, and they say they like it,
and they say they get things out of it. But

00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:07.770
there are things to think about and I, I would
invite your attention to these and maybe we

00:45:07.770 --> 00:45:13.590
can think about how we could structure questions
with your data sets that might, might bring

00:45:13.590 --> 00:45:15.530
helpful answers.

00:45:15.530 --> 00:45:19.230
One of the questions is jus-, tech-induced
isolation. There are people who worry that

00:45:19.230 --> 00:45:25.010
this environment is so compelling now that
people will turn to it as a substitute for

00:45:25.010 --> 00:45:29.930
engagement in real life. That people prefer
living in virtual space rather than face-to-face

00:45:29.930 --> 00:45:36.020
space because it's easier, it's less hassle,
it's less threatening in some respects, and

00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:39.430
it's just, it's just an easier way to be,
particularly if you're not necessarily the

00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:44.640
most extroverted person. A lot of the data
we see cuts against that. Tha-, that the people

00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:48.650
who are the heaviest tech users are also the
most socially engaged, the, have the most,

00:45:48.650 --> 00:45:50.790
the, large-scale and most diverse networks.

00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:55.590
But there is something to, to worry about
that obviously nags at the culture and, and,

00:45:55.590 --> 00:46:01.860
and we get it reflected in our lives a lot
of times. There, obviously there is the privacy

00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:05.490
question. In this environment where so much
is being disclosed and so much is being captured

00:46:05.490 --> 00:46:12.190
and so much can be m-, molded together, there
are ways now that people are anxious about

00:46:12.190 --> 00:46:15.740
the degree to which they are ceding control
of their identity.

00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:20.930
The millennials story in this is a little
bit different. My friend, Dana Boyd, i-, has

00:46:20.930 --> 00:46:25.650
the smartest formula, formulation of this.
In the policy sphere in privacy, you talk

00:46:25.650 --> 00:46:30.550
about Personally Identifiable Information,
P-I-I, right? That's the term of art.

00:46:30.550 --> 00:46:37.550
Well, Dana says for kids or for people, you
know, under 30, it's not so much PII as P-E-I;

00:46:37.550 --> 00:46:42.540
they worry about Personally Embarrassing Information.
Their metric for figuring out what to disclose

00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:47.310
or what can come back to bite them is not
necessarily their email address or their cell

00:46:47.310 --> 00:46:50.600
phone number that can be used to text, or
their birthday, which all of them will disclose

00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:54.590
under virtually any circumstances. But it's
stuff that's embarrassing that could come

00:46:54.590 --> 00:47:00.530
back to challenge who they are and to make
life more uncomfortable for them as they find

00:47:00.530 --> 00:47:06.410
new employers, find new significant others,
find all sorts of new ways to engage the world

00:47:06.410 --> 00:47:11.470
and so privacy has a somewhat different context
in this, in, in this social networking environment

00:47:11.470 --> 00:47:14.801
than it might have had, especially for Americans,
in the past.

00:47:14.801 --> 00:47:19.750
And then they finally, there's, there's this
sort of biggest series of issues that these

00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:24.130
technologies allow all sorts of great social
interactions and community formation to take

00:47:24.130 --> 00:47:29.810
place. It is indiscriminate about whether
good guys are performing those acts or bad

00:47:29.810 --> 00:47:35.200
guys. Th-, it's just as easy for bad guys
to find new communities of interest and perform

00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:40.270
new sort of outreach with these technologies,
recruit new members, gain new things, and

00:47:40.270 --> 00:47:42.310
actually reinforce their belief system.

00:47:42.310 --> 00:47:45.930
And in this environment, it's a lot easier
to find people who think exactly like you

00:47:45.930 --> 00:47:50.830
do. And you can sc-, screen the world in a
way that you don't have contrary information

00:47:50.830 --> 00:47:55.390
or, or other data that challenges that point
of view and so it's self-reinforcing. So,

00:47:55.390 --> 00:48:00.150
lots of communities get power out of that.
Think of the people who suffer from rare cancers

00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:03.620
who now have new hope because they can meet
people like them and learn from people like

00:48:03.620 --> 00:48:09.510
them, but it's the same dynamic that allows
terrorists and pedophiles and other awful

00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:14.310
actors also to engage in that kind of behavior.

00:48:14.310 --> 00:48:18.860
So that's, jus-, to get out of the act of
depressing you in the final moment of my talk,

00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:23.930
I, I will say that the evidence about the
power of the social networks is pretty clear

00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:28.510
on this. There is a long here, history of
data, f-, that Wellman and others have collected

00:48:28.510 --> 00:48:33.100
on this that people who have big networks,
particularly with lots of weak ties, th-,

00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:37.480
the people that are outside that boundary
of, of, of really tight-knit friends, and

00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:40.930
people who have diverse networks, people who
have people in their networks who don't share

00:48:40.930 --> 00:48:45.070
their same belief system, don't share their
same ec-, socioeconomic status, their same

00:48:45.070 --> 00:48:49.800
race or creed or color, or ha-, people who
have more diversity in their networks got

00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:54.960
a lot of benefits out of that. People who
have bigger, broader networks are healthier,

00:48:54.960 --> 00:49:00.750
wealthier, happier and from a social researchers
perspective, they build better communities.

00:49:00.750 --> 00:49:05.020
They just do be-, more stuff, they're more
civically engaged in part because they have

00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:10.570
lots of reasons to be connected to others
and feel civically engaged. I've, I've taken

00:49:10.570 --> 00:49:15.550
a lot of your time and I really appreciate
your sticking with me and I'm happy to answer

00:49:15.550 --> 00:49:20.780
questions now about our work and both from
a technical end but I'd mostly like to hear

00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:25.490
kind of what you think would be interesting
for a place like mine that looks at the social

00:49:25.490 --> 00:49:28.500
impact w-, w-, what we might be profitably
looking into. Yeah?

00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:47.010
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 3: [inaudible]

00:49:47.010 --> 00:49:59.480
&gt;&gt;Lee: "What's changing?" is the question
just for those who are, are watching. The

00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:03.900
blog numbers have been absolutely steady state
since 2005, and it's a much harder subject

00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:10.150
to ask about now because blogging or blog-like
functions are baked into lots of other tec-,

00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:13.700
technology. So, people say, "I'm doing social
networking activity," even when they're writing

00:50:13.700 --> 00:50:19.760
on their MySpace blog in the blog space. So,
that's been harder to capture; still, an incredible

00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:25.510
growth in the social networking space itself.
An-, an-, it older adults are now, which is

00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:30.030
freaking out the kids, but that's i-, we're
still seeing a lot.

00:50:30.030 --> 00:50:35.740
Twitter has s-, shown some growth although
and it might be the case that that's beginning

00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:41.530
to taper off for-, in America anyway. The
video numbers are higher than w-, we're comparing

00:50:41.530 --> 00:50:48.070
them to 2007 numbers and they're significantly
higher than 2007. And what's, what's interesting

00:50:48.070 --> 00:50:52.690
it, is though, even in the content creation
space there's more sort of activity in that

00:50:52.690 --> 00:50:58.770
realm. So people a-, are not just posting
single pictures, they're posting large albums.

00:50:58.770 --> 00:51:03.420
And they're not just posting one-off videos
of two seconds of them being stupid on the

00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:05.340
street corner, but they're doing lots of videos.

00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:10.390
So the intensity of it is growing and in,
that's a dramatic part of the story, almost

00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:15.100
as much as the volume of, or the, the size
of the population growing. So there's, there's

00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:20.590
still more to do and there's, I'm trying to
think of what other, other ways that we're

00:51:20.590 --> 00:51:24.480
going to be trying to catch as well. I-, It'll
be interesting to see what happens to this

00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:28.870
in the apps culture; whether they're, whether
apps are enabling of this stuff, or whether

00:51:28.870 --> 00:51:34.980
apps sort of pull people back into more sort
of singular, not necessarily unsocial, but,

00:51:34.980 --> 00:51:39.480
but sort of singular engagements with other
people and media, rather than sort of multiple

00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:41.190
engagements. Yeah?

00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:44.370
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 4: I, I've seen and in fact,
lived through a transition from typewriters

00:51:44.370 --> 00:51:47.780
to keyboards and most of my interaction with
a computer has been sitting at something that

00:51:47.780 --> 00:51:51.180
actually has a physical keyboard. Whereas,
when I look at my nieces with their cell phones,

00:51:51.180 --> 00:51:55.431
and I, of course, have a Nexus one in my pocket
and use it more and more often. I guess it's

00:51:55.431 --> 00:52:21.560
got a keyboard, it's got a virtual keyboard
but I don't use it in the same way at all.

00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:22.560
&gt;&gt;Lee: Right.

00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:29.100
&gt;&gt;Audience 4: Now, I have to imagine that
that transition is affecting both the content

00:52:29.100 --> 00:52:35.310
creation versus content consuming and also
the nature of the content being created. It's

00:52:35.310 --> 00:52:41.100
easier to take that picture with this than
it is to write two paragraphs. You know, I

00:52:41.100 --> 00:52:42.100
can write something that's 140 characters
but more than that, I don't really want--

00:52:42.100 --> 00:52:43.100
&gt;&gt;Lee: Yeah.

00:52:43.100 --> 00:52:44.100
&gt;&gt;Audience 4: I don't want to spend. So, I,
I wondered if any of your research or any

00:52:44.100 --> 00:52:45.100
of your surveys have shown a transition as
people move away from desktop systems and

00:52:45.100 --> 00:52:52.750
into the mobile computing world in what they're
creating and the nature of what they read

00:52:52.750 --> 00:52:55.300
or what they look at.

00:52:55.300 --> 00:52:59.420
&gt;&gt;Lee: Yeah, the, the question was about the,
the possible change and the nature of what

00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:03.660
people are creating as we move from a computer
environment to a mobile environment. Everything

00:53:03.660 --> 00:53:09.700
that you said is, is happening. Although,
we don't, we don't track it as, as so much

00:53:09.700 --> 00:53:15.910
as a change as a sort of add-on. In many cases,
there are people now who are tor, living a

00:53:15.910 --> 00:53:20.360
life on their mobile device that is, that
is supplanting time that they spent on their

00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:25.350
computers. And they are, they're somewhat
different content creators, th-, but the sort

00:53:25.350 --> 00:53:29.470
of big story that we capture, we don't ask,
you know detailed questions about frequency.

00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:31.100
They're doing both.

00:53:31.100 --> 00:53:36.040
Those people tend to have multiple devices
in their lives, multiple times with access

00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:40.310
during the day to different devices and they
think now, they're beginning to think about

00:53:40.310 --> 00:53:44.690
their devices serving different purposes in
ways that they didn't before. So there's,

00:53:44.690 --> 00:53:48.510
I mean, the, the standard story with lots
of content creation is that there's a, an

00:53:48.510 --> 00:53:52.710
infatuation phase for everybody and then there's
a drop-off after you've blogged a couple of

00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:56.270
times and y-, you know, three people read
it and they don't say anything nice about

00:53:56.270 --> 00:53:58.780
it, you stop blogging and things.

00:53:58.780 --> 00:54:03.890
So that, that, that continues to happen but
I think you're absolutely right. We see that

00:54:03.890 --> 00:54:10.090
in, in the mobile environment because cameras
and video, cameras are baked into the devices

00:54:10.090 --> 00:54:14.760
now there's j-, just a lot more picture sharing
going on. It's done on the fly. We don't yet

00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:20.690
see m-, changes in, in activities with social
networking sites yet, but w-, wh-, it's one

00:54:20.690 --> 00:54:24.550
of the things that we're going to keep watching
because it, it, it'll be interesting to see

00:54:24.550 --> 00:54:29.230
if people begin to think that th-, literally
life-logging through their social networking

00:54:29.230 --> 00:54:30.240
site or something else.

00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:40.660
And that, and it, and the, the sort of general
trend towards, away from text towards video

00:54:40.660 --> 00:54:46.420
is probably true in time allocation, but wh-,
one of the most interesting stories that we

00:54:46.420 --> 00:54:50.880
have captured in our teenage work is that
texting is alive and well in part because

00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:56.990
it serves different social purposes from video
or other kinds of content creation. It's just

00:54:56.990 --> 00:55:02.620
nice to be private when you're just sitting
in the back seat of the car when you can text

00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:06.180
it or do it under the dinner table. Or you
can do it in your classroom when your teacher

00:55:06.180 --> 00:55:10.820
isn't looking. Or you can do it in the hallways
when you don't want somebody to overhear what

00:55:10.820 --> 00:55:11.820
you're saying.

00:55:11.820 --> 00:55:16.240
There is just a special power to certain kinds
of, of text transactions that doesn't at all

00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:19.190
relate to the fact that they're texts. It
relates to the fact that they can be much

00:55:19.190 --> 00:55:24.950
more private and secure than video, verbal
kinds of conversations. So there's something

00:55:24.950 --> 00:55:30.020
going on in that space where text is just
elevated and elevated and elevated as a, as

00:55:30.020 --> 00:55:35.210
a, a-, we measure it by the frequency of contact
with friends outside of school. Texting has

00:55:35.210 --> 00:55:41.230
overtaken everything now by frequency of contact,
not necessarily meaning of contact. And we'll,

00:55:41.230 --> 00:55:45.500
d-, y-, a, I would, it's, it's, it is, it
is shifting, but it's more the case that people

00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:49.660
are now doing multiple things with multiple
devices and aren't necessarily giving up a

00:55:49.660 --> 00:55:55.510
lot yet in the computing environment for the
mobile environment. Yeah?

00:55:55.510 --> 00:56:01.700
&gt;&gt; Audience Male 5: [inaudible]

00:56:01.700 --> 00:56:04.641
&gt;&gt;Lee: Happier and more civically engaged.

00:56:04.641 --> 00:56:09.280
&gt;&gt;Audience5: [inaudible]

00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:13.930
&gt;&gt;Lee: Yeah.

00:56:13.930 --> 00:56:20.910
&gt;&gt;Audience 5: [inaudible ]

00:56:20.910 --> 00:56:27.440
&gt;&gt;Lee: That's a great question. The question
is on causality or, or, or, or does technology

00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:33.220
make your social networks, therefore make
you healthy, wealthy, w-, happy, and, and,

00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:39.290
and civically engaged. We don't have longitudinal
data on this so the answer is we don't know

00:56:39.290 --> 00:56:45.060
how, the directional arrow. It probably goes
in both directions because we see for sure

00:56:45.060 --> 00:56:49.530
on the technology side that the people who
increasingly intensify their engagement also

00:56:49.530 --> 00:56:55.470
ha-, grow their networks. They're just; they're
bigger today than they were yesterday.

00:56:55.470 --> 00:56:59.460
Would that maybe not have happened with that
technology? It's possible. It might be a life

00:56:59.460 --> 00:57:02.870
stage event, it might be related to their
employment, it might be related to something

00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:06.971
going on in their community that matters.
But it's, it's generally the case that the

00:57:06.971 --> 00:57:11.000
more technology you have and the more that
you're engaged with it, the bigger things,

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:15.850
the bigger your network is, the more diverse
it is, and the more diverse it's become over

00:57:15.850 --> 00:57:16.850
time.

00:57:16.850 --> 00:57:23.520
The, the other, the other way that we've seen
this is and it, this, this, i-, we can't say

00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:30.290
that it for sure yet because the 2008 election
was so different for Americans than elections

00:57:30.290 --> 00:57:37.050
that came before. But there were, you, you
could see that the heavy technology users

00:57:37.050 --> 00:57:42.300
were much more likely to be voters than not,
and there were more heavy technology users

00:57:42.300 --> 00:57:44.230
and more voters than before.

00:57:44.230 --> 00:57:48.700
And obviously, there was something going on
with younger voters and the Obama campaign

00:57:48.700 --> 00:57:53.790
and so it would be interesting to see in 2012
whether that first glimmer, and particularly

00:57:53.790 --> 00:57:58.390
among social networkers. The social networkers
themselve-, people in social networking sites

00:57:58.390 --> 00:58:03.950
were so active in promoting him, mobilizing
their friends, hosting new groups, forming

00:58:03.950 --> 00:58:09.070
new groups, joining new groups, that there,
it seemed to be causing a higher level engagement

00:58:09.070 --> 00:58:12.390
and then eventually higher levels of voting,
but we don't have enough data to know for

00:58:12.390 --> 00:58:13.630
sure whether that's happening.

00:58:13.630 --> 00:58:18.800
And there is pretty good research in, c-,
from other places showing at the, at least

00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:24.580
from a social psychological standpoint, that
Internet use, heavy Internet use makes you

00:58:24.580 --> 00:58:30.410
more of what you already are. Extroverts became
more extroverted; introverts became more introverted

00:58:30.410 --> 00:58:34.840
and I, we haven't been able to duplicate that.
We haven't even gone after it but it's, it's,

00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:42.210
it's probably a pretty mixed picture.

00:58:42.210 --> 00:58:48.720
[pause]

00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:55.220
Yeah?

00:58:55.220 --> 00:59:48.051
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 6: I'm old enough to remember
the 60s when people talk about the generation

00:59:48.051 --> 00:59:49.051
gap. [inaudible ] And now I feel like we've
gotten back to that point where society is

00:59:49.051 --> 00:59:50.051
again [inaudible] I wonder if anybody has
looked at [inaudible].

00:59:50.051 --> 00:59:51.051
&gt;&gt;Lee: Right.

00:59:51.051 --> 00:59:52.051
&gt;&gt;audience6: [inaudible]

00:59:52.051 --> 00:59:53.051
&gt;&gt;Lee: Yeah.

00:59:53.051 --> 00:59:54.051
&gt;&gt;audience6: So I'm wondering if there is
[inaudible]

00:59:54.051 --> 00:59:55.051
&gt;&gt;Lee: The, the question is about generational
a, ferment and strife, and the 60s compared

00:59:55.051 --> 01:00:00.790
to now. The, the work that we've done looking
at generational differences over time, but

01:00:00.790 --> 01:00:07.880
particularly now, suggest that technology
is a, a primary marker of the differences.

01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:14.230
Although, there is not nearly the hostility
and contentiousness over technology use and

01:00:14.230 --> 01:00:19.250
the meaning of technology that there was,
for instance, in arguments over civil rights

01:00:19.250 --> 01:00:23.240
and women's rights and the, the conduct in
the Vietnam War and the structure of government

01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:24.500
and, and things like that.

01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:30.240
So, it's, so the nature of the conflict, particularly
around technology is not nearly as intense.

01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:36.510
The consensus view is that younger people
know it better, use it better, are, are more

01:00:36.510 --> 01:00:41.790
adept at it and you know, ok, we can live
with that. They, they might be doing s-, silly

01:00:41.790 --> 01:00:47.150
things with it but it's not like there are
families being ripped asunder in great numbers

01:00:47.150 --> 01:00:49.970
because of technology use of that type.

01:00:49.970 --> 01:00:56.390
The parallels between this sort of larger,
cultural issues that were unfolding in the

01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:59.761
60s and then unfolding now, actually holds
up pretty well. I mean, th-, there, there's

01:00:59.761 --> 01:01:05.300
an economy that is going through a, a wrench.
The, in the 60s it was the, the first stages

01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:10.250
of globalization. Now, it's, it's much more
intensified with different kinds of actors.

01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:15.260
There was a question about America's place
in the world in the 60s, in the Cold War.

01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:19.810
There is a similar question about America's
place in the world in the post-Cold War world,

01:01:19.810 --> 01:01:23.960
in the multi-polar world and stuff like that.
And so we're, th-, the, the level of ferment

01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:28.050
about that question, of wh-, wh-, what's the
right way to play it, what the right way for

01:01:28.050 --> 01:01:33.380
us to act in this world is, is different.
And technology fits into that story in part

01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:39.290
because of what you know you've decided before.
People are using it in part to reinforce their

01:01:39.290 --> 01:01:46.660
views or, or find tribes like theirs so that
they can be with a l-, be with the like-minded.

01:01:46.660 --> 01:01:50.260
But there are other things that are playing
into that story. I mean, Red America, and

01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:55.560
Blue America, is an artifact, too, of redistricting
policies and the, and the ease with which

01:01:55.560 --> 01:02:00.021
now it's easy to figure out sort of who the
Republican voters in the district are and

01:02:00.021 --> 01:02:04.530
who the Democrats are and state legislatures
are really good at carving out safe republican

01:02:04.530 --> 01:02:09.751
and safe democratic districts. And so, there,
the incentive for people to talk to Independents

01:02:09.751 --> 01:02:15.300
and Moderates in the middle is sort of less
evident now because our, our political structures

01:02:15.300 --> 01:02:16.300
are that way, too.

01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:20.420
So there are, are, are, are a host of other,
larger social changes that fit in to this

01:02:20.420 --> 01:02:23.970
technology story. It's just technology is
the most dramatic thing and it's, and it's

01:02:23.970 --> 01:02:30.190
implicated in a lot of this stuff. So, it's,
that's a, a mushy answer to a really serious

01:02:30.190 --> 01:02:36.260
question. And I, but we don't know is, is,
is a lot of what, what is, where, where technology

01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:38.220
ends and where other sort of things take over.

01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:39.220
&gt;&gt;Nikolas: Ok--

01:02:39.220 --> 01:02:40.220
&gt;&gt;Lee: Yeah.

01:02:40.220 --> 01:02:41.220
&gt;&gt;Nikolas: so, we're at the end of this and
we're really happy you were born in New York

01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:42.220
because--

01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:43.220
[Lee laughs]

01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:44.220
you've gone through a lot--

01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:45.220
[Lee laughs]

01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:54.630
we really, it's a good thing when you have
to break up stuff and we still have questions

01:02:54.630 --> 01:02:55.630
coming. We thank you for your excellent presentation
and--

01:02:55.630 --> 01:02:56.630
&gt;&gt;Lee: Thank you.

01:02:56.630 --> 01:02:57.630
&gt;&gt;Nikolas: and your really interesting talk.

01:02:57.630 --> 01:02:58.630
&gt;&gt;Lee: Thank you, thank you.

01:02:58.630 --> 01:02:59.630
[loud applause]

01:02:59.630 --> 01:02:59.633
&gt;&gt;Lee: Thank you.
