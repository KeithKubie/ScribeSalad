00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:06.390
Cunningham’s Law is an internet adage that
states “The best way to get the right answer

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.960
on the Internet is not to ask a question,
but to post the wrong answer.”

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.200
It’s an interesting hypothesis for sure.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.530
And, if you’ve spent any time on the internet
whatsoever, you’re likely well aware that

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:21.250
posting something incorrect online is a sure-fire
way to illicit a smarmy correction from a

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.060
fellow internet denizen.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.730
In fact, Today I Found Out wouldn’t exist
if it wasn’t for our deep-seated desire

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.460
to correct all of those little urban myths
that float around the internet- there was

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.831
(and is) a decided dearth of “interesting
fact” websites that bother to actually do

00:00:35.831 --> 00:00:40.149
in-depth research on the “facts” they
purport, let alone ones that included all

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:43.120
the relevant interesting details on the topic
at hand.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.250
Likewise, while it doesn’t happen often
due to several levels of fact checking performed

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.050
by the author and a separate fact checker
for each article, when a mistake slips through

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.050
the cracks (nobody bats a thousand), it doesn’t
take long for one of our readers or listeners

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.609
to post a comment making us aware of the error.

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:00.320
So who was Cunningham of Cunningham’s Law?

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.160
In a nutshell, Cunningham is none other than
Ward Cunningham, the man who invented the

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.000
“user editable website” or “wiki”
as it’s more commonly known.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.070
Just to be clear, because it’s a fairly
common mistake, Ward doesn’t have anything

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.240
directly to do with Wikipedia.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.210
Ward simply developed the first ever wiki
in the mid-1990s, dubbing it “WikiWikiWeb”

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.690
after the Wiki Wiki Shuttles he’d encountered
in Honolulu.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.500
The word “wiki” itself is Hawaiian for
“quick” whereas “wiki wiki” means

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.500
“very quick”.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.820
(Incidentally, it’s also technically pronounced
we-key, not wick-ey, though given that pretty

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.170
much everyone mispronounces it, Cunningham
and others have long stopped correcting people,

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.799
ironically enough given the topic at hand.)

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.119
From there, wiki software was developed by
Peter Merel, CvWiki, based on WikiWikiWeb’s

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:42.119
engine “WikiBase.”

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:48.340
In turn, Marcus Denker developed AtisWiki
based on CvWiki, then Clifford Adams developed

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.070
UseModWiki based on AtisWiki.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.079
This all brings us back to Wikipedia, which
originally used UseModWiki as its platform.

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:00.509
Due to performance issues, among other problems,
this was quickly replaced by a wiki platform

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.930
that would come to be called MediaWiki.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.670
This was developed specifically for Wikipedia,
initially by Magnus Manske, then when performance

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.730
issues again became an issue, largely re-written
by Lee Daniel Crocker, with many others since

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:13.900
contributing.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.881
In any event, the term “Cunningham’s Law”
first appeared online in 2010 in an issue

00:02:17.881 --> 00:02:22.650
of the New York Times as a comment left by
one Steven McGeady, who you may or may not

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.060
recognise as a former executive at Intel and
the guy who famously testified against Microsoft

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.790
during their 1998 anti-trust trial.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.190
The comment itself was left in response to
an article asking users to submit “novel

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.590
eponymous laws” in the same vein as things
like Murphy’s Law or Godwin’s Law, the

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.840
latter of which states: “As an online discussion
grows longer, the probability of a comparison

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.050
involving Nazis or Hitler approaches 1.”

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.280
According to the comment left by McGeady,
Cunningham’s Law was “named after Ward

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.730
Cunningham, a colleague of mine at Tektronix.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.400
This was his advice to me in the early 1980s
with reference to what was later dubbed USENET,

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.049
but since generalized to the Web and the Internet
as a whole.”

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:05.380
He also goes on to point out the irony of
the relationship between Cunningham, his law,

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.760
and the fact that, “Wikipedia is now perhaps
the most widely-known proof of Cunningham’s

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.760
Law.”

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.830
In short, the Cunningham of Cunningham’s
Law is the guy who invented the first version

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.629
of the platform which Wikipedia would ultimately
be based; the law itself began as advice he

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:22.620
gave to people in the 1980s; and the only
reason we know of it today is because someone

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.360
he mentioned the idea to talked about it in
the comments of an article online.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.290
We’re going to be honest, we’re kind of
hoping Cunningham at some point comes out

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.930
and claims he was misquoted or never actually
said that.

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.959
Bonus Fact:
• If you’re wondering, Cunningham never

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.280
tried to patent his idea of a wiki because
“I was a small company and I figured, well,

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.400
if I got a patent then I’d have to go out
and sell people on the idea that anyone could

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.400
edit.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.660
That just sounded like something that no one
would want to pay money for.”

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.740
Of course, the platform is used in some form
or another by many thousands of businesses

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.629
today (often internally), and many of the
public sites based on it, such as Wikipedia,

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:10.660
have tremendous value.
