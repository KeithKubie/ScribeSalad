00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.937
The answer is that the exponent here should be a times b or just ab. This

00:00:05.949 --> 00:00:12.196
expression over here says multiply x to the a times itself b number of times,

00:00:12.326 --> 00:00:18.512
but we also know that x to the power of a tells us to take x, and multiply it by

00:00:18.524 --> 00:00:23.869
itself a number of times. If we wrote each of these factors of x to the a as a

00:00:23.881 --> 00:00:28.742
bunch of x's multiplied together, we would just get a giant string of x's all

00:00:28.754 --> 00:00:33.469
multiplied together. Since we're taking b groups of a things multiplied

00:00:33.481 --> 00:00:36.918
together, the total number of x's we have is a times b.
