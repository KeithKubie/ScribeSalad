00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.613
All right.
What we are going to do today

00:00:08.613 --> 00:00:14.266
is I am going to start talking
about the development of atomic

00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:17.416
theory.
So in the next few minutes,

00:00:17.416 --> 00:00:22.698
I am going to wiz through the
observations that led to the

00:00:22.698 --> 00:00:29.000
belief that atoms were the most
basic constituent of matter.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.211
And then, what we are going to
see is that the atom can

00:00:33.211 --> 00:00:37.111
actually be split up,
that the atom is not the most

00:00:37.111 --> 00:00:41.245
basic constituent of matter,
that there is at least an

00:00:41.245 --> 00:00:44.988
electron and a nucleus.
And we are going to start

00:00:44.988 --> 00:00:49.512
talking about what are the
fundamental principles that have

00:00:49.512 --> 00:00:53.802
to obtain in order for that
electron and nucleus to hang

00:00:53.802 --> 00:00:59.133
together to remain an entity.
And what we are going to see is

00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:02.711
that we are going to have to
understand a new kind of

00:01:02.711 --> 00:01:06.634
mechanics to understand how that
electron and nucleus hang

00:01:06.634 --> 00:01:09.111
together.
And then, further on in the

00:01:09.111 --> 00:01:13.309
course, we are going to see we
are going to need that new kind

00:01:13.309 --> 00:01:17.369
of mechanics to also understand
how two atoms hang together,

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.916
how two atoms bind to form a
molecule.

00:01:19.916 --> 00:01:22.599
All right.
But today, I will lecture for

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:26.178
the first two-thirds or
three-quarters of the course,

00:01:26.178 --> 00:01:29.000
and then I will stop,
--

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.711
-- and then I will introduce
the rest of our teaching team.

00:01:33.711 --> 00:01:37.773
And we will talk about the
mechanics of the course.

00:01:37.773 --> 00:01:41.997
We will talk about the
expectations of the course and

00:01:41.997 --> 00:01:45.896
some details like that.
Okay, so let's get going,

00:01:45.896 --> 00:01:48.333
here.
And now we could turn the

00:01:48.333 --> 00:01:53.044
lights down because I am going
to use the slide here in the

00:01:53.044 --> 00:01:54.344
front.
All right.

00:01:54.344 --> 00:02:00.206
The ancient Greek philosophers.
They certainly were known to

00:02:00.206 --> 00:02:04.699
have pondered whether matter can
be divided endlessly into

00:02:04.699 --> 00:02:09.192
smaller and smaller pieces or
whether there was a point at

00:02:09.192 --> 00:02:12.660
which you couldn't divide matter
any further.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.049
And Aristotle,
here, well, he was one of the

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:20.463
philosophers who argued that
matter could be divided into

00:02:20.463 --> 00:02:24.955
smaller and smaller particles,
chopped up into smaller and

00:02:24.955 --> 00:02:27.162
smaller pieces,
ad infinitum,

00:02:27.162 --> 00:02:32.507
matter was divisible.
This is called the Continuum

00:02:32.507 --> 00:02:36.447
Theory of Matter.
Continuum because you don't

00:02:36.447 --> 00:02:40.298
have any discrete points.
It is a continuum.

00:02:40.298 --> 00:02:43.701
No boundaries.
But there was a contrary

00:02:43.701 --> 00:02:48.268
philosophy, heralded by
Democritus, who actually was

00:02:48.268 --> 00:02:52.029
about a hundred years older than
Aristotle.

00:02:52.029 --> 00:02:57.134
And he held that matter indeed
was composed of individual,

00:02:57.134 --> 00:03:02.244
discrete particles.
These discrete particles he

00:03:02.244 --> 00:03:06.484
called "atomos." "A" for not,
"tomos" for divisible.

00:03:06.484 --> 00:03:10.474
That is the origin of our word,
of course, atoms.

00:03:10.474 --> 00:03:13.633
Now, in the fourth,
fifth century B.C.,

00:03:13.633 --> 00:03:18.704
there wasn't much evidence one
way or the other for either one

00:03:18.704 --> 00:03:22.694
of these philosophies.
And I call it a philosophy

00:03:22.694 --> 00:03:27.100
because it was a search for
understanding reality by a

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.007
speculative, as opposed to an
investigational or

00:03:31.007 --> 00:03:34.000
observational,
means.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.621
But for whatever reason,
it was Aristotle,

00:03:37.621 --> 00:03:42.920
here; his continuum theory of
matter prevailed all the way to

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.011
the 17th century.
And here, in fact,

00:03:46.011 --> 00:03:50.957
he is depicted by Raphael on a
fresco on the walls of the

00:03:50.957 --> 00:03:55.726
Vatican, holding court,
the continuum theory of matter.

00:03:55.726 --> 00:04:01.025
But just about at the same time
at which Raphael painted this

00:04:01.025 --> 00:04:05.000
picture, there were
observations.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.640
A set of observations that were
being made that began to point

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.910
out that matter wasn't really
behaving and reacting like a

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:21.089
continuum, that matter was
behaving more like it had some

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:25.804
discrete nature to it.
What were those observations?

00:04:25.804 --> 00:04:29.873
Well, one of them was by this
gentleman here,

00:04:29.873 --> 00:04:34.242
Robert Boyle.
And guess what his formal

00:04:34.242 --> 00:04:36.485
occupation was.
Chemistry?

00:04:36.485 --> 00:04:41.059
That's a good guess,
but his formal occupation was a

00:04:41.059 --> 00:04:45.365
theologian, as most scientists
were at that time.

00:04:45.365 --> 00:04:49.401
And you, of course,
know him for the empirical

00:04:49.401 --> 00:04:54.784
observation that the pressure
times the volume is constant as

00:04:54.784 --> 00:04:59.000
long as the temperature is
constant.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.963
But he actually advanced one of
the first ideas of an element.

00:05:04.963 --> 00:05:09.069
And that is,
he called an element a certain

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:14.349
primitive unmingled body.
And that somehow you can take

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:20.508
these primitive unmingled bodies
and put them together to form a

00:05:20.508 --> 00:05:24.810
perfectly mixed body,
a compound, a molecule.

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:30.187
So this was one of the first
ideas of elements that come

00:05:30.187 --> 00:05:36.379
together to form molecules.
And then there was this

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:42.275
gentleman, Joseph Priestly.
Guess what his occupation was?

00:05:42.275 --> 00:05:44.965
He was a priest,
of course.

00:05:44.965 --> 00:05:49.827
And what did he do?
Well, he looked at reactions

00:05:49.827 --> 00:05:55.517
with dephlogisticated air,
dephlogisticated air reacting

00:05:55.517 --> 00:06:00.268
with materials.
And what he observed was that

00:06:00.268 --> 00:06:04.805
these materials reacted more
vigorously in dephlogisticated

00:06:04.805 --> 00:06:07.465
air.
Well, what is dephlogisticated

00:06:07.465 --> 00:06:09.029
air?
Well, of course,

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:12.315
now we know dephlogisticated
air is oxygen.

00:06:12.315 --> 00:06:16.147
It is air with the nitrogen
predominantly removed.

00:06:16.147 --> 00:06:19.589
But it really took this
gentleman, Lavoisier,

00:06:19.589 --> 00:06:23.501
to really understand what
Priestly was doing in his

00:06:23.501 --> 00:06:26.786
experiments.
And what Lavoisier realized is

00:06:26.786 --> 00:06:31.479
that this dephlogistic air was
kind of adding to the material

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:37.360
when it did this reaction.
And he made those observations,

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.168
or he came to those
conclusions, by doing some very

00:06:41.168 --> 00:06:45.129
careful measurements of the mass
before the reaction,

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:49.317
so the mass of the dephlogistic
air plus the mass of the

00:06:49.317 --> 00:06:51.907
material.
And he found that indeed,

00:06:51.907 --> 00:06:56.476
the mass after the reaction was
equivalent to that before the

00:06:56.476 --> 00:07:00.801
reaction.
And so he was one of the first

00:07:00.801 --> 00:07:06.496
individuals to realize that a
chemical reaction can be written

00:07:06.496 --> 00:07:10.885
down analogous to writing an
algebraic equation.

00:07:10.885 --> 00:07:16.674
Well, Lavoisier also did a lot
of work with isolating elements.

00:07:16.674 --> 00:07:21.716
He identified 17 metals and
nine nonmetals as elements.

00:07:21.716 --> 00:07:27.039
Well, for all of his efforts,
we all know what happened to

00:07:27.039 --> 00:07:31.153
Lavoisier.
Because of his connection to

00:07:31.153 --> 00:07:35.000
the French monarchy,
the judge at his trial claimed

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.076
that the republic has no use for
savants.

00:07:38.076 --> 00:07:41.538
Lagrange at that time,
a French mathematician,

00:07:41.538 --> 00:07:45.538
said, "It took but a moment to
cut through that head,

00:07:45.538 --> 00:07:50.000
but it will require a hundred
years to produce another like

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.923
it." Well, there was another
Frenchman at that time,

00:07:53.923 --> 00:07:54.230
J.
L.

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:56.307
Proust.
He was a little more

00:07:56.307 --> 00:08:01.711
politically savvy.
He high-tailed it over to Spain

00:08:01.711 --> 00:08:06.784
and led a long and healthful
life as a professor in Madrid.

00:08:06.784 --> 00:08:10.545
But what he did was he did some
experiments.

00:08:10.545 --> 00:08:15.268
And he observed that when two
or more elements combine,

00:08:15.268 --> 00:08:20.516
well, they combine to form a
compound, they always combine in

00:08:20.516 --> 00:08:25.763
definite proportions by weight,
and it didn't matter what the

00:08:25.763 --> 00:08:31.005
method of preparation was.
And because he made this

00:08:31.005 --> 00:08:36.019
observation over and over again
with many different elements,

00:08:36.019 --> 00:08:40.281
this became known as the Law of
Definite Proportion.

00:08:40.281 --> 00:08:45.128
Again, some indication that
matter had a discrete nature to

00:08:45.128 --> 00:08:48.136
it, and it wasn't just the
continuum.

00:08:48.136 --> 00:08:50.727
Some numbers were involved
here.

00:08:50.727 --> 00:08:54.069
But it really took this guy,
John Dalton,

00:08:54.069 --> 00:08:59.000
English schoolteacher with a
lot of interests.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.474
He was aware of the
observations of Boyle and

00:09:03.474 --> 00:09:06.830
Priestly and Lavoisier and
Proust.

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:13.033
And what he realized was that
he could begin to understand all

00:09:13.033 --> 00:09:19.338
of those observations if he went
back all the way to Democritus

00:09:19.338 --> 00:09:25.033
and Democritus' idea of atomos
or atoms, these individual

00:09:25.033 --> 00:09:30.917
discrete particles of matter.
And so he set forth some

00:09:30.917 --> 00:09:35.631
postulates, some postulates
which of course now are known as

00:09:35.631 --> 00:09:39.866
Dalton's Atomic Theory.
But what he said was that each

00:09:39.866 --> 00:09:44.661
element is composed of atoms.
He said that atoms of any given

00:09:44.661 --> 00:09:48.576
element are identical.
He said that compounds form

00:09:48.576 --> 00:09:52.171
when atoms are more than one
element combined.

00:09:52.171 --> 00:09:55.527
And he realized,
of course from Lavoisier's

00:09:55.527 --> 00:09:58.963
observations,
that atoms are neither created

00:09:58.963 --> 00:10:03.975
nor are they destroyed.
Now, just an aside,

00:10:03.975 --> 00:10:08.240
John Dalton,
with his breadth of interest,

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:13.336
he also was the first
individual to document color

00:10:13.336 --> 00:10:17.392
blindness in human beings.
And, in fact,

00:10:17.392 --> 00:10:21.135
we do call color blindness
Daltonism.

00:10:21.135 --> 00:10:28.000
See, we are getting you ready
for medical school already.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.648
But what I want you to
recognize here is that Mr.

00:10:31.648 --> 00:10:35.904
Dalton didn't actually do any
of the experiments himself.

00:10:35.904 --> 00:10:40.465
Although, from what I know of
him, I think he could have done

00:10:40.465 --> 00:10:44.570
the experiments himself,
but rather he was aware of the

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:49.358
seemingly disparate observations
made by Lavoisier and Boyle and

00:10:49.358 --> 00:10:51.182
Proust.
And he just said,

00:10:51.182 --> 00:10:54.451
well, you know,
if I take those observations

00:10:54.451 --> 00:10:58.403
and I use this framework,
well, then I can understand

00:10:58.403 --> 00:11:02.037
them.
They make sense within this

00:11:02.037 --> 00:11:05.132
framework.
And this is a powerful approach

00:11:05.132 --> 00:11:08.000
in science.
A lot of science progresses

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.641
this way.
That is that there is this

00:11:10.641 --> 00:11:14.113
collection of seemingly
disparate observations,

00:11:14.113 --> 00:11:18.339
and then all of a sudden
somebody comes along and sees an

00:11:18.339 --> 00:11:22.641
organizing principle in all of
those observations and puts

00:11:22.641 --> 00:11:28.000
forth then these postulates.
That is what Dalton did here.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.435
Now, of course,
these postulates weren't

00:11:31.435 --> 00:11:34.870
accepted immediately.
And rightfully so,

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:39.538
because they were just
postulates, they needed further

00:11:39.538 --> 00:11:43.590
substantiation.
And that further substantiation

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:47.378
came in terms of the work by
this gentleman,

00:11:47.378 --> 00:11:51.518
Joseph Gay-Lussac,
the Law of Combining Volumes.

00:11:51.518 --> 00:11:54.777
It came by the work of this
gentleman.

00:11:54.777 --> 00:11:59.621
This gentleman is Lorenzo
Romano Amadeo Carlo Avogadro's

00:11:59.621 --> 00:12:03.186
hypothesis.
And, of course,

00:12:03.186 --> 00:12:07.535
you can all read Italian,
so you can read what is on the

00:12:07.535 --> 00:12:11.252
stamp here, right?
It just says equal volumes of

00:12:11.252 --> 00:12:15.997
gas under the same conditions of
temperature lead to the same

00:12:15.997 --> 00:12:19.951
number of molecules.
See, you didn't know you could

00:12:19.951 --> 00:12:22.244
read Italian,
but there it is.

00:12:22.244 --> 00:12:26.831
And further substantiation for
this idea of an atom and the

00:12:26.831 --> 00:12:33.000
discreteness of matter came from
this gentleman Ludwig Boltzmann.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.193
Gas Kinetic Theory.
He proposed that well,

00:12:36.193 --> 00:12:40.087
you know, pressure,
that must be due to these atoms

00:12:40.087 --> 00:12:44.448
that are moving around and
hitting the walls of a vessel,

00:12:44.448 --> 00:12:49.199
those impacts give rise to the
pressure that is exerted on the

00:12:49.199 --> 00:12:52.236
walls of that vessel.
And then, finally,

00:12:52.236 --> 00:12:55.975
it took this gentleman
Cannizaro, and it took his

00:12:55.975 --> 00:13:00.730
statesmanship.
Because what Cannizaro did,

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:06.797
and now this is the later 1800s
or so, what Cannizaro did was

00:13:06.797 --> 00:13:12.157
that he got the scientific
establishment at that time.

00:13:12.157 --> 00:13:16.707
And the scientific
establishment at that time,

00:13:16.707 --> 00:13:21.258
of course, was this small group
of pale males.

00:13:21.258 --> 00:13:27.224
But he got them to listen to
Dalton's Atomic Theory and then

00:13:27.224 --> 00:13:32.280
the ensuing experiments of
Avogadro and Gay-Lussac,

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:35.484
etc.
And, finally,

00:13:35.484 --> 00:13:40.964
he got them to say,
yes, there is something right

00:13:40.964 --> 00:13:47.472
about this atomic theory of
matter, the idea that mass was

00:13:47.472 --> 00:13:53.409
made up of discrete particles
called atomos or atoms.

00:13:53.409 --> 00:14:00.488
Well, nowadays we of course can
actually image individual atoms

00:14:00.488 --> 00:14:06.449
or molecules.
And what you see here is an

00:14:06.449 --> 00:14:13.348
array of 28 CO molecules.
And these 28 CO molecules are

00:14:13.348 --> 00:14:20.246
arranged in the form of a little
man or a little woman,

00:14:20.246 --> 00:14:27.273
I will let you figure it out,
but these are CO molecules

00:14:27.273 --> 00:14:34.431
sitting on a platinum surface.
And so each one of these orange

00:14:34.431 --> 00:14:39.058
balls here is a CO molecule,
but when CO binds to a platinum

00:14:39.058 --> 00:14:43.607
surface, it does so with the
carbon end down and the oxygen

00:14:43.607 --> 00:14:46.196
end up.
And there is a really good

00:14:46.196 --> 00:14:50.823
reason for why that is the case,
and we will talk about that

00:14:50.823 --> 00:14:53.725
when we talk about molecular
orbitals.

00:14:53.725 --> 00:14:58.196
What you are seeing here is
really just the tops of the CO

00:14:58.196 --> 00:15:02.442
molecules.
You are seeing the oxygen end

00:15:02.442 --> 00:15:04.885
of the CO molecule.
All right.

00:15:04.885 --> 00:15:10.024
Well, this image here was taken
by something called a scanning

00:15:10.024 --> 00:15:13.730
tunneling microscope.
And, I am sorry to say,

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:18.448
but this was actually invented
just before you were born.

00:15:18.448 --> 00:15:22.491
And it was invented,
it was actually worked on by

00:15:22.491 --> 00:15:26.366
Ruska, and then perfected by
Binnig and Rohrer,

00:15:26.366 --> 00:15:31.000
and they won a Nobel Prize for
their work.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.752
And the way the technique works
is the following.

00:15:36.752 --> 00:15:40.707
Let me have the board lights
here.

00:15:40.707 --> 00:15:44.543
I am going to do some board
work.

00:15:44.543 --> 00:15:51.134
What you do to do this is that
you take a tungsten wire,

00:15:51.134 --> 00:15:58.445
and you do a little chemistry.
You etch the tungsten wire down

00:15:58.445 --> 00:16:05.661
to as fine a tip as you can.
You put it in some potassium

00:16:05.661 --> 00:16:10.890
hydroxide, you send some current
through it, do a little

00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:15.454
electrochemistry,
and what you will get then is a

00:16:15.454 --> 00:16:20.017
pretty fine tip at the end of
this tungsten wire.

00:16:20.017 --> 00:16:25.626
But then, what you do is you
take that tungsten wire and you

00:16:25.626 --> 00:16:30.000
attach it to a piezoelectric
crystal.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.870
A piezoelectric crystal,
and let me put it this way

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:40.909
here, a piezoelectric material
is some material that if you put

00:16:40.909 --> 00:16:45.194
a voltage across it,
it expands a little bit,

00:16:45.194 --> 00:16:48.896
a little bit meaning ten,
20 angstroms.

00:16:48.896 --> 00:16:54.740
And so now, if you attach the
tungsten wire to that material,

00:16:54.740 --> 00:17:00.000
you have some control on the
angstrom scale.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.849
So, that is what happens in
order to move that tip around.

00:17:05.849 --> 00:17:11.802
But then what you do is you
take this tip and you bring it,

00:17:11.802 --> 00:17:17.652
say, within five angstroms of
the top of this CO molecule.

00:17:17.652 --> 00:17:23.913
If I have my platinum surface
here and my carbon here and here

00:17:23.913 --> 00:17:28.223
is my oxygen,
what I am going to do is I am

00:17:28.223 --> 00:17:33.868
going to bring this tip,
say, within five angstroms here

00:17:33.868 --> 00:17:39.000
of this oxygen and of the CO
molecule.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.351
And then I am going to put a
negative voltage on this

00:17:43.351 --> 00:17:47.284
tungsten tip here.
And I am going to take the CO

00:17:47.284 --> 00:17:52.556
molecule, I am going to take the
platinum surface and I am going

00:17:52.556 --> 00:17:56.154
to grind it.
Now, in this tungsten tip there

00:17:56.154 --> 00:17:59.000
are, of course,
electrons.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.504
And, since this is a metal,
metal has a characteristic

00:18:03.504 --> 00:18:08.433
where some of those electrons
are not strongly bound to the

00:18:08.433 --> 00:18:11.577
nucleus.
They actually roam around the

00:18:11.577 --> 00:18:14.212
solid.
And this is a high energy

00:18:14.212 --> 00:18:16.762
state.
Given that electrons are

00:18:16.762 --> 00:18:20.926
negatively charged,
and they are in an environment

00:18:20.926 --> 00:18:25.600
of this negative potential,
that is a rather high energy

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:31.372
state for those electrons.
So if I were to draw an energy

00:18:31.372 --> 00:18:34.061
level diagram here,
this is energy,

00:18:34.061 --> 00:18:38.647
and I am going to represent
those electrons on the tungsten

00:18:38.647 --> 00:18:42.522
tip, it is going to be at a sum
high energy level.

00:18:42.522 --> 00:18:45.132
This is electrons on the
tungsten.

00:18:45.132 --> 00:18:48.928
However, there are also some
electrons down here,

00:18:48.928 --> 00:18:51.459
and they are at ground
potential.

00:18:51.459 --> 00:18:56.362
These electrons are at a lower
energy, so I am going to draw an

00:18:56.362 --> 00:19:02.307
energy level representing them.
This is the electrons on the

00:19:02.307 --> 00:19:04.945
platinum.
And so this coordinate,

00:19:04.945 --> 00:19:07.582
here, is kind of like a
distance.

00:19:07.582 --> 00:19:12.362
So this is the electrons on the
tungsten, over here are the

00:19:12.362 --> 00:19:17.060
electrons on the platinum.
And what these electrons on the

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:21.840
tungsten tip would like to do is
to be here on the platinum

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:26.785
because that is a lower energy
state, but the problem is that

00:19:26.785 --> 00:19:32.318
there is a gap right here.
There is no material between

00:19:32.318 --> 00:19:36.044
the tip and the oxygen end of
the CO molecule.

00:19:36.044 --> 00:19:40.019
If you do it in a vacuum,
there is a vacuum here,

00:19:40.019 --> 00:19:44.324
there is a vacuum gap.
And so for the electrons to go

00:19:44.324 --> 00:19:48.050
from here to here,
well, there is a very large

00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:50.866
barrier.
This is a very high energy

00:19:50.866 --> 00:19:56.000
state if an electron were in
between this gap here.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.992
I am going to represent that
energy change as the electrons

00:20:00.992 --> 00:20:06.156
go from the tungsten tip to the
platinum surface as a barrier

00:20:06.156 --> 00:20:11.493
like this, a very large barrier.
Now, you have seen these kinds

00:20:11.493 --> 00:20:16.055
of, we call them reaction
coordinates, in chemistry in

00:20:16.055 --> 00:20:18.982
high school.
That is, you have seen

00:20:18.982 --> 00:20:24.318
situations where we might have,
if we are doing an energy level

00:20:24.318 --> 00:20:30.000
diagram, this is the energy of
the reactants out here.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.569
This is the energy of the
products.

00:20:32.569 --> 00:20:36.952
And in between there is this
activation energy barrier that

00:20:36.952 --> 00:20:39.219
we call E(act).
In other words,

00:20:39.219 --> 00:20:42.090
you have to put energy into the
system.

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:46.775
In order to get the reaction to
go, you have to put energy into

00:20:46.775 --> 00:20:50.176
the system before you get any
energy back out.

00:20:50.176 --> 00:20:53.727
And that is what happens in a
chemical reaction,

00:20:53.727 --> 00:20:58.337
we put energy into the system
before we make it go or can make

00:20:58.337 --> 00:21:02.500
it go.
But in this particular case,

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:06.160
the electrons,
they don't behave like most

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:09.285
reactants.
The electrons right here,

00:21:09.285 --> 00:21:12.678
you know what they do?
These electrons,

00:21:12.678 --> 00:21:15.714
they go right through that
barrier.

00:21:15.714 --> 00:21:20.000
They don't care that there is a
brick wall there.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.392
They just go right through the
barrier.

00:21:23.392 --> 00:21:28.035
We call that tunneling.
And how in the world can that

00:21:28.035 --> 00:21:32.487
happen?
Well, that can happen because

00:21:32.487 --> 00:21:36.949
electrons, unlike most atoms and
molecules over here,

00:21:36.949 --> 00:21:39.694
are quantum mechanical
particles.

00:21:39.694 --> 00:21:43.726
And they do not obey classical
mechanical rules.

00:21:43.726 --> 00:21:48.959
And that is a subject that we
are going to start talking about

00:21:48.959 --> 00:21:52.734
today and tomorrow and for the
next few days.

00:21:52.734 --> 00:21:56.680
These electrons,
they just tunnel right through

00:21:56.680 --> 00:22:02.000
that barrier and get over here
to the other side.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.651
That means, in this
experimental setup,

00:22:05.651 --> 00:22:11.128
if I were to connect a wire
from this tungsten tip here to

00:22:11.128 --> 00:22:15.163
the platinum,
and I put in an ammeter right

00:22:15.163 --> 00:22:21.120
there, so I measure the current,
I would be seeing some current

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:27.174
flow, some measure of this flow
of electrons from the tip to the

00:22:27.174 --> 00:22:31.378
tungsten.
And so that is what is done in

00:22:31.378 --> 00:22:34.788
the technique.
But, now, how do you get this

00:22:34.788 --> 00:22:39.625
image that I showed you earlier
from this kind of arrangement?

00:22:39.625 --> 00:22:44.224
Well, what you do is you now
take this tungsten tip and you

00:22:44.224 --> 00:22:47.000
mount it on a piezoelectric
crystal.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.123
I forgot to tell you sometimes
piezoelectric crystal,

00:22:51.123 --> 00:22:55.643
quartz is a piezoelectric,
barium titanate is a

00:22:55.643 --> 00:22:58.418
piezoelectric.
But you mount it on a

00:22:58.418 --> 00:23:03.255
piezoelectric crystal that will
allow you to move from side to

00:23:03.255 --> 00:23:07.623
side.
I move now my tungsten tip over

00:23:07.623 --> 00:23:11.009
a little bit.
And I know exactly how much

00:23:11.009 --> 00:23:15.833
over I moved it because I have
calibrated my piezoelectric

00:23:15.833 --> 00:23:18.542
crystal.
But now what do you see?

00:23:18.542 --> 00:23:23.028
Well, if you just moved it
over, you didn't change the

00:23:23.028 --> 00:23:26.752
vertical distance,
if you just moved it over,

00:23:26.752 --> 00:23:32.000
what do you think would happen
to the current here?

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.116
Decrease.
It would absolutely decrease.

00:23:35.116 --> 00:23:37.741
Why?
Because you now have changed

00:23:37.741 --> 00:23:42.416
the distance between the oxygen
end and that tungsten tip.

00:23:42.416 --> 00:23:47.091
Over here, on this diagram,
you made this barrier thicker.

00:23:47.091 --> 00:23:51.684
And the thicker you make it,
the more difficult it is for

00:23:51.684 --> 00:23:56.605
those electrons to get through,
so the current is going to go

00:23:56.605 --> 00:24:00.178
down.
In order to bring the current

00:24:00.178 --> 00:24:04.835
back up, what you are going to
do is you are going to take that

00:24:04.835 --> 00:24:09.492
tungsten tip and you are going
to move it down slightly so that

00:24:09.492 --> 00:24:13.098
the distance now,
between the tip and the oxygen,

00:24:13.098 --> 00:24:17.605
is going to be the same as it
was in this particular position

00:24:17.605 --> 00:24:21.211
from here to here.
So, then you bring the current

00:24:21.211 --> 00:24:23.915
back up.
But, again, you know exactly

00:24:23.915 --> 00:24:28.572
how far down you moved that tip
and how far over you moved that

00:24:28.572 --> 00:24:31.974
tip.
You have got now two points.

00:24:31.974 --> 00:24:35.924
Now we have got to keep going.
What are we going to do to

00:24:35.924 --> 00:24:38.392
scan?
Well, we're going to move this

00:24:38.392 --> 00:24:42.272
tungsten tip over again.
And, again, the current in this

00:24:42.272 --> 00:24:44.740
particular case is going to go
down.

00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:48.901
In order to bring it back up,
you are going to move this tip

00:24:48.901 --> 00:24:52.710
further down so that the
distance between here and here

00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:54.967
is the same as it was
originally.

00:24:54.967 --> 00:25:00.723
So, reestablish the current.
But, again, you know exactly

00:25:00.723 --> 00:25:05.294
how far down and how far over
you moved the tip.

00:25:05.294 --> 00:25:10.352
And then what you do,
you assign a different color to

00:25:10.352 --> 00:25:14.729
the different distances above
the CO molecule.

00:25:14.729 --> 00:25:20.468
And, if you assign different
colors, you can get this image.

00:25:20.468 --> 00:25:24.650
For example,
if we can dim the lights on the

00:25:24.650 --> 00:25:30.000
blackboard again,
we will look at the slide.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.015
If the tip is very far from the
surface, we would give it kind

00:25:35.015 --> 00:25:38.633
of a whitish color.
And as it gets closer and

00:25:38.633 --> 00:25:42.909
closer to the surface,
we give it a darker and darker

00:25:42.909 --> 00:25:45.458
orangey color.
And then finally,

00:25:45.458 --> 00:25:49.981
when it is so far down that it
is actually in contact or

00:25:49.981 --> 00:25:54.092
tunneling to the platinum,
we give it a blue color.

00:25:54.092 --> 00:25:56.888
So, that is how you get this
image.

00:25:56.888 --> 00:26:01.000
That is the basis of this
technique.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:07.699
Now you also notice that these
CO molecules have a peculiar

00:26:07.699 --> 00:26:11.742
arrangement.
And this is not due to,

00:26:11.742 --> 00:26:17.633
in the most au courant
language, intelligent design.

00:26:17.633 --> 00:26:23.640
Rather this is due to a very
patient experimentalist,

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:26.066
i.e.
graduate student,

00:26:26.066 --> 00:26:32.303
who spent 24 hours putting
these CO molecules into this

00:26:32.303 --> 00:26:37.740
particular position.
How did he do that?

00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:41.038
Well, he did it in the
following way.

00:26:41.038 --> 00:26:45.893
He first took a few CO
molecules and put them anywhere

00:26:45.893 --> 00:26:49.923
on the surface,
just to expose the surface to

00:26:49.923 --> 00:26:55.786
some gas, and then he imaged the
surface to figure out where they

00:26:55.786 --> 00:27:00.000
were.
And so if these CO molecules --

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.035
My soccer balls are the CO
molecules.

00:27:03.035 --> 00:27:06.323
And if my foot here is the
tungsten tip.

00:27:06.323 --> 00:27:11.128
You just imaged the surface to
figure out where they were,

00:27:11.128 --> 00:27:13.742
because we knew where they
were.

00:27:13.742 --> 00:27:17.283
Then he has got to move these
CO molecules.

00:27:17.283 --> 00:27:21.498
He brings the tip close to one
of the CO molecules.

00:27:21.498 --> 00:27:26.641
And then, if you put a voltage
pulse on that piezoelectric and

00:27:26.641 --> 00:27:30.941
actually jerk the tip,
you can jerk it such that you

00:27:30.941 --> 00:27:36.000
hit the CO molecule and it goes
flying away.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.723
That is nice,
but now where did it go?

00:27:38.723 --> 00:27:43.214
Well, in order to find out you
have to image the whole surface

00:27:43.214 --> 00:27:45.791
again.
And you would find that it is

00:27:45.791 --> 00:27:50.134
somewhere all the way over here.
Now you really want it over

00:27:50.134 --> 00:27:52.638
there, so you repeat the
operation.

00:27:52.638 --> 00:27:55.877
Well, 24 hours later you get
this little man.

00:27:55.877 --> 00:28:00.000
[LAUGHTER] And I know it was 24
hours later.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.334
It is going to be a while
before this kind of

00:28:04.334 --> 00:28:08.374
nanotechnology,
assembling a molecule by a

00:28:08.374 --> 00:28:14.384
molecule, beats the synthesis in
a beaker to put the molecules

00:28:14.384 --> 00:28:19.211
where you want them.
But, even though this kind of

00:28:19.211 --> 00:28:25.320
visual observation of atoms and
molecules really was impossible

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:30.246
a hundred years ago,
the evidence that I alluded to

00:28:30.246 --> 00:28:36.354
or quickly went through earlier
was really quite compelling for

00:28:36.354 --> 00:28:42.020
the existence of atoms.
And the observation or the

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:46.138
belief that the atom was the
most basic constituent of

00:28:46.138 --> 00:28:50.645
matter, the elementary particle.
You couldn't have anything

00:28:50.645 --> 00:28:53.287
smaller than an atom.
And, in fact,

00:28:53.287 --> 00:28:58.027
at the end of the last century,
it was generally believed that

00:28:58.027 --> 00:29:03.000
the theoretical structure of the
universe was complete.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.988
Nature was understood.
There were no more discoveries

00:29:06.988 --> 00:29:08.982
to be made.
And, after all,

00:29:08.982 --> 00:29:13.660
there were, by this time in the
late 1800s, a lot of advances.

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:18.032
Well, Newtonian mechanics,
that had already been known for

00:29:18.032 --> 00:29:22.864
250 years, mechanics that guides
the motion of all bodies around

00:29:22.864 --> 00:29:27.312
us, even astronomical bodies.
Thermodynamics was completely

00:29:27.312 --> 00:29:31.049
developed.
Statistical mechanics was

00:29:31.049 --> 00:29:35.147
developed, statistical
mechanics, which relates the

00:29:35.147 --> 00:29:39.655
microscopic description of the
behavior of matter to the

00:29:39.655 --> 00:29:43.672
macroscopic description of the
behavior of matter.

00:29:43.672 --> 00:29:48.016
And also there were these
optics experiments of Young,

00:29:48.016 --> 00:29:52.852
Freznel and Hertz that seemed
to put to rest the question of

00:29:52.852 --> 00:29:56.540
whether or not light was a
particle or a wave.

00:29:56.540 --> 00:30:01.377
Boy, those experiments seem to
be absolutely conclusive that

00:30:01.377 --> 00:30:06.917
light was a wave.
Those experiments demonstrated

00:30:06.917 --> 00:30:11.197
Maxwell's equations,
Maxwell's equations that

00:30:11.197 --> 00:30:15.866
unified the field of optics and
electromagnetism.

00:30:15.866 --> 00:30:21.215
So by this time there were all
of these accomplishments.

00:30:21.215 --> 00:30:26.468
The idea was that everything
was done, and the idea was

00:30:26.468 --> 00:30:31.525
remaining, that the work that
remained was largely to

00:30:31.525 --> 00:30:36.000
investigate the next decimal
place.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:41.543
Everything else was done.
However, at the same time,

00:30:41.543 --> 00:30:46.652
by the late 1800s,
there began to be two sets of

00:30:46.652 --> 00:30:51.434
observations,
two tracks of observations that

00:30:51.434 --> 00:30:56.869
if you look closely,
began to illustrate that maybe

00:30:56.869 --> 00:31:03.451
things weren't quite so clear.
Maybe things were quite as well

00:31:03.451 --> 00:31:05.824
understood.
And what were those

00:31:05.824 --> 00:31:09.305
observations?
Well, one of those observations

00:31:09.305 --> 00:31:12.706
is the discovery,
that we are going to start

00:31:12.706 --> 00:31:16.344
looking at today,
that the atom is not the most

00:31:16.344 --> 00:31:21.011
basic constituent of matter,
that you can take an atom apart

00:31:21.011 --> 00:31:25.519
into an electron and a nucleus,
at least an electron and a

00:31:25.519 --> 00:31:29.000
nucleus.
So, that is one track.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:34.522
The other track is that light
appeared to behave in some cases

00:31:34.522 --> 00:31:40.045
like a particle and not a wave.
And one of those cases is this

00:31:40.045 --> 00:31:44.028
observation here of the
photoelectric effect.

00:31:44.028 --> 00:31:48.646
So, what we're going to do is
look at both tracks of

00:31:48.646 --> 00:31:53.089
observations here.
And we are going to see how

00:31:53.089 --> 00:31:57.424
these observations made it such
that it was impossible to

00:31:57.424 --> 00:32:01.682
explain how an atom held
together, how an electron and a

00:32:01.682 --> 00:32:06.171
nucleus held together within the
classical way of thinking,

00:32:06.171 --> 00:32:10.583
within the Newtonian mechanics,
the mechanics that you are

00:32:10.583 --> 00:32:13.989
going to be looking at this
semester in 8.01.

00:32:13.989 --> 00:32:18.633
You cannot use that mechanics
to understand how this electron

00:32:18.633 --> 00:32:23.200
and the nucleus stay together.
You cannot use that mechanics

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:28.000
to understand how two atoms are
bound together.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.994
We need a new way of thinking.
And it is these two tracks of

00:32:32.994 --> 00:32:37.227
observations that led to the
discovery, in a sense,

00:32:37.227 --> 00:32:42.306
of this new kind of mechanics
that we are going to be talking

00:32:42.306 --> 00:32:45.354
about.
Okay, so let's start on one of

00:32:45.354 --> 00:32:48.910
these tracks.
And that track of seeing that

00:32:48.910 --> 00:32:53.312
the atom is not the most basic
constituent to matter.

00:32:53.312 --> 00:32:57.714
And the first observation was
done by this gentleman,

00:32:57.714 --> 00:32:58.052
J.
J.

00:32:58.052 --> 00:33:02.511
Thomas.
It was the discovery of the

00:33:02.511 --> 00:33:06.232
electron.
Okay, so I am going to need the

00:33:06.232 --> 00:33:08.000
lights on again.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.809
All right.
What J.J.

00:33:20.809 --> 00:33:26.238
Thomas was interested in doing
was understanding what deep

00:33:26.238 --> 00:33:31.476
discharges were made of,
so he had a glass tube that was

00:33:31.476 --> 00:33:35.700
evacuated.
And in it he had what we're

00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:40.599
going to call here a cathode.
And he had an anode.

00:33:40.599 --> 00:33:45.099
And, as I said,
a glass tube pumps out the air

00:33:45.099 --> 00:33:50.200
and then he fills it up with
hydrogen, H two.

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:56.299
And what he does is he puts a
large negative potential on this

00:33:56.299 --> 00:33:59.372
cathode.
And on the anode,

00:33:59.372 --> 00:34:03.814
he puts a large positive
potential, and he cranks up the

00:34:03.814 --> 00:34:08.175
potential difference here.
And he keeps cranking it up,

00:34:08.175 --> 00:34:11.567
until at some point the gas
begins to glow.

00:34:11.567 --> 00:34:16.332
And it is at that point that
this discharge here is ignited.

00:34:16.332 --> 00:34:20.855
And this is a kind of plasma.
And he wanted to understand

00:34:20.855 --> 00:34:24.327
what is in this plasma.
He was just curious.

00:34:24.327 --> 00:34:28.204
He wanted to know.
And so what he does is that he

00:34:28.204 --> 00:34:33.471
pokes a hole here in this anode.
There's a hole.

00:34:33.471 --> 00:34:37.591
And he lets out a little of
this discharge.

00:34:37.591 --> 00:34:41.908
And he lets it out.
And my chalk is breaking.

00:34:41.908 --> 00:34:46.224
He lets it out.
And way back here he has some

00:34:46.224 --> 00:34:50.737
kind of a screen,
a phosphor screen so that not

00:34:50.737 --> 00:34:56.231
only does this discharge here
kind of glow as it's moving

00:34:56.231 --> 00:35:00.449
along, but when it hits the
phosphor screen,

00:35:00.449 --> 00:35:04.611
it lights up.
And so that's nice.

00:35:04.611 --> 00:35:09.447
But then, what he does is he
takes two parallel plates and

00:35:09.447 --> 00:35:13.179
puts them above and below this
luminous beam,

00:35:13.179 --> 00:35:18.269
and there is a positive charge
on one of these and a negative

00:35:18.269 --> 00:35:21.493
charge on the other.
And lo and behold,

00:35:21.493 --> 00:35:25.141
when he increases this
potential difference,

00:35:25.141 --> 00:35:28.365
this delta V,
what happens is that this

00:35:28.365 --> 00:35:32.012
luminous beam,
some of that luminous beam is

00:35:32.012 --> 00:35:38.400
actually deflected a little bit.
And so now there is another

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:41.955
very bright spot.
And he can measure this

00:35:41.955 --> 00:35:45.333
deflection.
And we are going to call it

00:35:45.333 --> 00:35:48.088
delta X.
Now, since some of this

00:35:48.088 --> 00:35:52.888
luminous beam was deflected
toward a positively charged

00:35:52.888 --> 00:35:57.777
plate, what kind of particles
did he decide were in this

00:35:57.777 --> 00:36:01.443
luminous beam?
Negative particles,

00:36:01.443 --> 00:36:05.774
because they're attracted to
the positively charged plate.

00:36:05.774 --> 00:36:08.585
So, he called this deflection
delta X.

00:36:08.585 --> 00:36:12.232
We will call it delta X sub
minus.

00:36:12.232 --> 00:36:16.563
Now, he knew enough about
electromagnetism at that time to

00:36:16.563 --> 00:36:21.122
realize that the amount of that
deflection has to be directly

00:36:21.122 --> 00:36:25.681
proportional to how much charge
was on the negatively charged

00:36:25.681 --> 00:36:28.568
particle.
And I am going to call that e

00:36:28.568 --> 00:36:33.078
sub minus.
Because the more charge,

00:36:33.078 --> 00:36:36.195
the easier it would be to
deflect it.

00:36:36.195 --> 00:36:41.044
And he recognized that the
amount of deflection has to be

00:36:41.044 --> 00:36:46.240
inversely proportional to the
mass of that negatively charged

00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:48.578
particle.
Because after all,

00:36:48.578 --> 00:36:53.513
the more massive that was,
the more difficult it was going

00:36:53.513 --> 00:36:57.497
to be to deflect it.
And then what he did is he

00:36:57.497 --> 00:37:02.000
cranked up delta V as much as he
could.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.882
And here I am taking a little
liberty with the story.

00:37:05.882 --> 00:37:09.840
I'm telling essentially the
essence of the experiment,

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:13.946
but it is a little more
complicated than what it is I am

00:37:13.946 --> 00:37:17.829
going to tell you right here.
But he cranked that up.

00:37:17.829 --> 00:37:21.338
And when he did,
he realized that there actually

00:37:21.338 --> 00:37:25.893
were some other particles that
were being deflected toward the

00:37:25.893 --> 00:37:30.000
negatively charged plate just a
little bit.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.496
All right?
Not a lot.

00:37:31.496 --> 00:37:34.939
Just a little bit.
And, again, he could measure

00:37:34.939 --> 00:37:37.559
that deflection.
And he called that,

00:37:37.559 --> 00:37:41.600
or we are going to call that,
delta X sub plus.

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:44.370
These have got to be positively

00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:48.935
charged particles because they
are attracted to the negatively

00:37:48.935 --> 00:37:52.004
charged plate.
And again, he realized that

00:37:52.004 --> 00:37:56.719
delta X sub plus
is proportional to the charge on

00:37:56.719 --> 00:38:01.284
that positively charged particle
and inversely proportional to

00:38:01.284 --> 00:38:06.000
the mass of that positively
charged particle.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.480
All right.
But now, here comes his

00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:13.487
thinking.
What he guessed is that these

00:38:13.487 --> 00:38:18.443
positively charged particles
were H plus,

00:38:18.443 --> 00:38:22.239
a hydrogen ion.
How did he know that?

00:38:22.239 --> 00:38:27.618
Well, this was a guess.
However, he did know that in

00:38:27.618 --> 00:38:35.000
this plasma, this discharge,
that there were hydrogen atoms.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.353
And how he knew,
that is something we're going

00:38:38.353 --> 00:38:41.706
to talk about in a few days.
But he knew that.

00:38:41.706 --> 00:38:45.358
He also knew H here,
these hydrogen atoms that are

00:38:45.358 --> 00:38:49.382
produced in the plasma,
somehow the plasma breaks the H

00:38:49.382 --> 00:38:52.437
two bond,
these hydrogen atoms were

00:38:52.437 --> 00:38:54.151
neutral.
And so he said,

00:38:54.151 --> 00:38:57.355
well, if it's a positively
charged particle,

00:38:57.355 --> 00:39:01.528
well, gee, it must be that
something was removed from the

00:39:01.528 --> 00:39:06.000
hydrogen atom to make it
positively charged.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:11.604
And that something must be this
negatively charged particle that

00:39:11.604 --> 00:39:15.518
I'm observing,
because I knew that originally

00:39:15.518 --> 00:39:18.631
the hydrogen atom has to be
neutral.

00:39:18.631 --> 00:39:22.279
So therefore,
I am going to guess that the

00:39:22.279 --> 00:39:27.616
magnitude of the charge on the
negatively charged particle is

00:39:27.616 --> 00:39:32.420
equal to the magnitude of the
charge on that positively

00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:37.273
charged particle.
And if that it is the case,

00:39:37.273 --> 00:39:42.578
then I can take a ratio here of
the deflection of the negatively

00:39:42.578 --> 00:39:46.873
charged particle to the
deflection on the positively

00:39:46.873 --> 00:39:50.831
charged particle.
And since these two are equal,

00:39:50.831 --> 00:39:54.621
I am guessing that,
since these two are equal,

00:39:54.621 --> 00:39:59.252
then this ratio has to just be
equal to the mass of that

00:39:59.252 --> 00:40:04.473
positively charged hydrogen atom
to the mass of that negatively

00:40:04.473 --> 00:40:07.851
charged particle.
All right?

00:40:07.851 --> 00:40:10.829
And now here is the important
point.

00:40:10.829 --> 00:40:15.425
The important point is that no
matter how he made these

00:40:15.425 --> 00:40:18.744
measurements,
no matter how he did that,

00:40:18.744 --> 00:40:23.340
the deflection for that
negatively charged particle was

00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:28.617
much, much, much larger than the
deflection for that positively

00:40:28.617 --> 00:40:33.701
charged particle.
That then meant that the mass

00:40:33.701 --> 00:40:39.104
of this positively charged
particle, which he guessed to be

00:40:39.104 --> 00:40:41.805
a hydrogen atom,
must be much,

00:40:41.805 --> 00:40:47.394
much larger than the mass of
the negatively charged particle.

00:40:47.394 --> 00:40:52.890
He also knew at that time that
a hydrogen atom was the least

00:40:52.890 --> 00:40:56.895
massive atom,
but here is an experiment that

00:40:56.895 --> 00:41:02.484
showed that there was a particle
that was less massive than a

00:41:02.484 --> 00:41:05.301
hydrogen atom.
Hey.

00:41:05.301 --> 00:41:08.689
But up until then,
it was the atom is the most

00:41:08.689 --> 00:41:13.057
basic constituent of matter.
You cannot chop it up anymore.

00:41:13.057 --> 00:41:17.198
But here was the evidence that
there was a particle less

00:41:17.198 --> 00:41:21.490
massive than the hydrogen atom.
Eventually it is called an

00:41:21.490 --> 00:41:24.427
electron.
But this is the first evidence

00:41:24.427 --> 00:41:28.493
here that the atom wasn't the
most basic constituent of

00:41:28.493 --> 00:41:32.158
matter.
Now, it actually took another

00:41:32.158 --> 00:41:36.474
ten years with the Millikan oil
drop experiment to actually

00:41:36.474 --> 00:41:40.939
measure this ratio correctly and
to determine the mass of the

00:41:40.939 --> 00:41:43.246
electron.
We won't go into that.

00:41:43.246 --> 00:41:46.371
But this ratio here,
you probably all know,

00:41:46.371 --> 00:41:50.762
the mass of the electron is
about 836 times that of the mass

00:41:50.762 --> 00:41:53.162
of the hydrogen atom or hydrogen
ion.
