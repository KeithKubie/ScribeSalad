00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.660
There would be 23 chromosomes in each daughter cell.

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.120
Think about this for a second. You have 23 pairs

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.890
of chromosomes. That's 46 chromosomes total. If we don't do

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:13.140
any kind of DNA duplication, we've got 46 in this

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.650
mother cell here. So without any kind of duplication, we

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.760
have to divide into two even or equal daughter cells

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.440
here. We're going to split that 46, and we're going to end

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.580
up with 23. Not 23 pairs, but 23 chromosomes total.
