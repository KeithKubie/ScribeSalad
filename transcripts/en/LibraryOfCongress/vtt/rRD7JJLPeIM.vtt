00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.660
It is truly a thrill to be

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.870
on the very first main
stage of the Festival.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.680 position:56%
For all of the many years that the
Library has brought this magnificent

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.080
celebration of books and reading,

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:59.070 position:56%
it's the first time the Library's
been able to offer such a large hall

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.750
and the ability to accommodate all
of you to hear the exciting writers

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.210
who will present their books on
the stage throughout the day.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.950
And today, through the
power of technology

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.160
that I am hearing coming
right with me,

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.730 position:56%
we are able to livestream this event

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.030
[ Applause ]

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:33.290
I am also Tweeting
throughout the day.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:34.590
[ Laughter ]

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.920
And adding to my -- the
Library's Facebook page.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.750
So we are really going on.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.150
And to the millions of fans
who follow the author we're

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.470
about to hear from today,
so welcome to all of you.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.590
The theme of the Festival this
year is Books as Journeys.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.590
And I promise you, you're on a
journey at the Book Festival today.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:02.880
Now this morning it is my distinct
pleasure to confer a Literary

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.240
and Literacy Champion Citation
to a very special individual

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.910
who embodies the work we --
and it's wonderful to say we --

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.400
the Library at Congress do every
day to promote reading, education,

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.500
scholarship, creativity, and the
importance of books to our culture.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.930
This year I am proud
to confer a Library

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.270
of Congress Literacy Champion
Citation to Mr. Stephen King.

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:45.130
[ Applause ]

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.770
Author of more than 50 books, all
of them international bestsellers

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.150
as well as hundreds
of short stories.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.790
And you all know Stephen
King's work.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.290
Throughout his career from Carrie
to Salem's Lot to The Shining

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:07.080
to Shimshack Redemption, and now
to his latest Edge -- End of Watch.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.710
He has continually brought
us spellbinding fiction

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.930
that makes us read,
keeps us reading,

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.540
and fixes us to the
edges of our seats.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.250
I'm sure you all know about
the many motion pictures

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.550
that have been made from his books.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.500
And just last year, the movie
Shawshank Redemption was named

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.740
to the Library of Congress'
National Film Registry

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.140
and will be preserved there because
of its great cultural importance.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.440
[ Applause ]

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:49.600 position:56%
Mr. King has certainly made his
mark on our culture in so many ways.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.090
What you might not know is how
devoted he has been through all

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.790
of these years to promoting
the indispensable tools

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.770
of reading and literacy.

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.670
Here's a writer who cares
about libraries, universities,

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.980
and education at large,
a prolific storyteller

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.420
who has worked tirelessly
to ensure that the children

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.310
of his state have what
it takes to read, learn,

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.660
and become vital participants
of our American culture.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.710
We are proud to single him
out now for that effort,

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.440
an individual who not only
gives back to his readers,

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.200
but ensures that the
number of readers grows.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.820
So please join me in
celebrating this singularly caring

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.080
and engaged American writer,

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.040
our Library of Congress Literacy
Champion, Mr. Stephen King.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:48.770
[ Applause ]

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:56.500
[ Inaudible ]

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:02.290
&gt;&gt; Stephen King: Thank you so much.

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:03.590
[ Applause ]

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.890
Thank you.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.510
Thank you.

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.380
Ah. Woo. There's a lot
of you people out there.

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:12.680
[ Laughter ]

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:20.100
And I was thinking about,
I was actually talking

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.990
about the first time that
I ever did a book signing.

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.180
I published my first novel, Carrie.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.600
And a bookstore chain
in Maine asked me

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:35.630
if I would come sign books,
so I said yes, I would.

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.480
And they had a little
table at the front

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.080
of the room with some copies on it.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.430
And five people showed up.

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.710
Three of them were college friends
of mine who had clubbed together

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.060
to buy one copy of the book.

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.270
And the other one was
a, a fat little child

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.340
who wanted the kung fu books.

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.430
So I helped him find those books,

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:03.120
and I guess he became
a satisfied customer.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.620
But it's strange to
see so many people.

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.570
Writers are supposed
to be secret agents.

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:14.470
We're supposed to observe you.

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:16.370
You're not supposed to observe us.

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:21.670
It's very strange to
have that happen.

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:25.900
Man, I was in -- I had published
a book -- you know, it's funny.

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.200
I foresaw Donald Trump.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.550 position:56%
I wrote a book called The Dead Zone.

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:29.850
[ Laughter ]

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:31.150
Is this thing on?

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:41.280
Can you hear me?

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.170
I, I guess you can.

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:50.590 position:56%
So I wrote this book called The
Dead Zone, and the publisher sent me

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:53.360
out on tour, and I was in New York.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.830
And I had a free day, and so
I went into Nathan's Hot Dogs.

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:59.370
I heard about them my whole life.

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:04.260
So I went into Nathan's, and I
ordered a couple of hot dogs.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:05.690
You know, I go everywhere
with a book.

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:09.050
So I was reading a book, and
I was sitting at the counter

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:11.250
and munching my hot dogs.

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:13.510
This was 1979, 1980.

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:14.930
My hair was still black.

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:19.890
I had this big writerly beard,
you know, and horn-rimmed glasses.

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:23.250
I thought I looked really serious.

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:27.680
The sad thing is I
thought I looked cool.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:32.610
So I'm sitting there in Nathan's
reading my book, and I look up,

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:36.060
and there's a pass through between
the kitchen and serving area.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.930
And the short order
cook is looking at me.

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:41.380
And as soon as he sees me
looking at him, he's back.

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:44.180
He's cooking, he's cooking.

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.450
So then I read my book
a little bit more,

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:49.950
and I look up and he's
looking at me.

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:55.080
And I think to myself,
"I have been recognized.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.780
I am on my way to becoming
a famous writer.

00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:59.820
I've been recognized."

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:04.960
So after a while, I'm getting ready
to get done, and the cook comes

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:11.000
around to the front,
and he approaches me,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.910
and he says, "Are you somebody?"

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:18.140
[ Laughter ]

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:22.750
And I said, "Well,
everybody's somebody."

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:25.890
He said, "Yeah, but are
you somebody famous?"

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:29.900
And I went kind of like,
"Well, you know, sort of."

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:33.260
He said, "Are you Francis
Ford Coppola?"

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.970
[ Laughter ]

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:39.530
And I said, "Yes, I am!"

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:45.460
Because you know, writers
are freaking liars.

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:47.600
That's what we do.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:52.620
I signed a menu for that guy
and the whole thing, you know?

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:56.260
Walked out of there a happy man.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:09:01.460
That Nathan's story always makes me
think of a conversation that I had

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:05.290
with my friend John Grisham
who's a great storyteller

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:08.050
and all-around cool guy.

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:13.670
And he and I did a joint appearance
at the Bradenham Public Library,

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:20.400 position:56%
and as I was driving him back to the
airport, he said, "You know what?

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:24.260
We're famous writers in a
country that doesn't read much."

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:30.600
And that was a bit
of an overstatement,

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.320
but it was truth to its core.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:39.190
That day at Nathan's was the
only day that I was ever mistaken

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:41.540
for Francis Ford Coppola,

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:44.720
but I can't tell you how many
times people have walked up to me

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:46.430
and said, "Aren't you
Steven Spielberg?"

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:48.310
[ Laughter ]

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:53.000 position:56%
They get this guy crossed circuit in
their mind or something like that.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.560
And so my response is
"You've got your wires crossed

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:00.170
because he scared people
with a shark,

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:02.400
and I scared people with a clown."

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:10.820
And there are a lot of folks
that come up to me and say,

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:17.190
"I haven't read any of your books,
but I've seen all of your movies."

00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:19.580
And if they say they've
seen all of my movies,

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:21.280
I think, "Oh, you poor sap.

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:23.110
You actually saw The Mangler?"

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:25.320
[ Laughter ]

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:30.160
"You saw all those Children
of the Corn sequels?"

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.220
I mean, those are the
most embarrassing things

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:35.460
in the whole world.

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:39.580
There are, like, seven
Children of the Corn movies.

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:45.680
And the one that I really always
wanted to see was the Children

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:49.090
of the Corn Meet Leprechaun,
you know?

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:54.570
That would have been a, that would
have been a good crossover thing.

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:57.730
I was in a supermarket.

00:10:57.730 --> 00:10:59.900
This was in Florida.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:01.910
My wife and I have
a place in Florida.

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:05.130
We didn't really want to go, but
we turned 65, and it's the law.

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:09.800
Kind of have to go
down there to Florida.

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:15.850
And my wife does the regular
shopping, but in the middle

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:18.340
of the week, if there's stuff
we need, she will send me

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:20.860
because she feels like I
can't [bleep] it up too bad.

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:30.110
And so I was in there one day,
and I was in the housewares aisle.

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:32.430
And this woman came
around the corner.

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:36.900
She was in one of the,
you know, the things,

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:39.530
you know they have these
electric carts for people

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:41.400
that don't have really
good mobility?

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.350
I'm always afraid one's
going to stroke out,

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:47.580 position:56%
and the thing's going go all maximum
overdrive, crash into everything.

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:51.650
But she was a, you know,
almost a Florida stereotype.

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:53.570
She had the golf tan, you know.

00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:56.870
She's about 140 years old.

00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:58.500
The golf shirt.

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:02.020
And she looked at me,
and then she looked away.

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:05.490
And then she looked back and
she said, "I know who you are.

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:06.790
You're Stephen King.

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:08.660
You make all those scary movies.

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:12.170
Well some people like those, but
I don't care for movies like that.

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:15.660
I like uplifting things like
that Shawshank Redemption."

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:19.550
[ Laughter ]

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:23.650
And I was flabbergasted, man!

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:24.950
And I said, "I wrote that!"

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:28.070
And she said, "No, you didn't!"

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:32.060
So anyway.

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:39.150
All of which shouldn't bring me to
the subject of literacy, but does.

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:44.010
And I don't ordinarily
speak from a prepared script

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:47.070 position:56%
which I have here on my trusty iPad.

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:55.630
I prefer to wander around and sort
of free associate, but on a subject

00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:57.690
like this, I thought
a few more foolish,

00:12:57.690 --> 00:13:00.620
smart remarks might be in order.

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:05.260
And a chance to prove that
even at my advanced age --

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.100
I turned 69 two days ago.

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:15.820
[ Applause ]

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:19.070
You're applauding because
I'm still alive, probably.

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:22.340
[ Laughter ]

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:30.100 position:56%
You know, the one thing that I don't
want is -- and this will happen.

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:33.800
It won't happen this year,
but once you turn 70,

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:35.680
you're an authentic geezer.

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:39.360
And then you know somebody's
going to say,

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:43.330
"Stephen King today
turned 70 years young."

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:44.630
[ Laughter ]

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:48.290
I'm not going to turn years young.

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:49.590
It's still years old.

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:51.920
Anyway, okay.

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:55.010
I'm sorry about that I
got a little carried away.

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.500
Anyway, literacy.

00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:03.120
I taught English for two year
before becoming a full-time writer.

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:06.330
And half-way through the second
year, I told my wife I was going

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:09.230
to go back to school
and get enough credits

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:11.700
to teach at the elementary level.

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:16.300
It took me just three semesters'
worth of experience at high school

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:19.820
to realize I had very
little purpose there.

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:21.870
My students fell into two groups:

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:26.120
one was self-propelled
when it came to reading.

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:27.760
You know, that's you guys.

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:30.640
I'm with my peeps today.

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:33.770
They were inner-directed,
the sociologist say,

00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:36.870
and eager to discuss
what they had read.

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:39.710
The other group consisted of
kids who were never going to read

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:44.620 position:56%
for pleasure and who regarded each
assignment, whether it James Thurber

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:49.120
or James Dickey as
a valueless trudge.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:51.900
These were the kids who were
going to grow up watching TV

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:55.550
and who would write
as seldom as possible.

00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:58.360
Their adventures in writing,
once they became adults

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:03.780
in this computer age would
mostly consist of text messages,

00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:06.780
emails assisted by Spellcheck.

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:09.740
And updating their
Facebook pages in which,

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:13.410
in many cases would
consist mostly of photos.

00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:16.590
Don't get me wrong.

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:18.880
A lot of them were damn good kids.

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:22.440
Fine sons, willing workers,
wonderful daughters,

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:27.510
exceptional school citizens,
each with his or her own talent.

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:31.640 position:56%
Whether it was hitting a baseball
or sewing costumes for a class play.

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:38.830 position:56%
It was just that when some of these
kids, many even, came into my Living

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:42.740
with English class, the
light went out of their eyes.

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:45.980
And no matter what I did,
that light did not come back

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:49.440
on until the bell rang.

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:53.360
These are the ones I began to
understand who lived in homes

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:57.460
where there were few books
and who would have few

00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:59.870
in their own homes
when they grew up.

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:03.460
And while some might occasionally
bring home a supermarket paper

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:06.950
like the National Enquirer,
few or none of them were going

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:11.090
to be subscribers to The
Atlantic or The New Yorker.

00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:14.830
Their knowledge of world events
would come from the Today Show,

00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:18.880 position:56%
Fox News, or possibly Rush Limbaugh.

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:22.910
The poetry they read would
come mostly on greeting cards.

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:27.820
This was the world of
non-readers I saw when I was 23.

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:31.660
Many of the kids in my classrooms
back then had considered reading,

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:35.440
tried it, found it
wholly dispensable,

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:39.000
hard work with no reward.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.300
I wanted to get them when
they were six or seven.

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:46.450
And new to the whole deal, you
know, the old "tabula rasa" thing?

00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:47.840
My wife was in favor.

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:52.120
She was raised Catholic and quoted
a line that she said was part

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:56.320
of the dogma, "Give them to
me," meaning Mother Church,

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:59.380
"when they are young, and
they're mine forever."

00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:03.390
I wanted to get them when I still
had a chance to convince them

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:07.390
that reading is more than a
door opener to a better job.

00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:10.270 position:56%
It's cool, it's a kick, it's a buzz.

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:12.940
Plain old fun.

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:16.230
Non-readers lived just
one single life.

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:17.530
It may be a good one.

00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:18.830
It may be a great one.

00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:21.110
But a reader can live thousands.

00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:24.990
I wanted kids that were
still open to that idea.

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:30.010
Sometimes when the right book
falls into the right pair of hands,

00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:33.480
it lights a fire and
leads to others.

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:40.330
I'm always thrilled when someone
tells me in person or a letter

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:45.520 position:56%
that something that I wrote pleased
them and led them onward from there.

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:47.860
And in some cases upward.

00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:50.970
God knows I never made
the mistake of thinking

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:54.020
that I was Herman Melville.

00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:55.330
I chickened out today.

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:57.150
I was going to wear a t-shirt.

00:17:57.150 --> 00:17:58.560
I've got it in my suitcase.

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:00.430
And finally I decided not to.

00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:03.100
And I wore this red one again.

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:05.870 position:56%
Red is supposed to be a power color.

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:08.320
My shirt is the color
of Donald Trump's tie.

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:10.090
[ Laughter ]

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:11.800
Yes, ladies and gentlemen.

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:14.180
Anyway, I've got a shirt
that says, "Real men read,"

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:17.300
and I wear it every
chance that I get

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:22.670
because I remember being
sneered at as a kid sometimes.

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:27.500
"There's Stevie," a farmer
up the road sometimes said.

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:30.110
"He's always got his
nose in a book."

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:34.740 position:56%
I have days when I'd like to go back
in time, collar that tractor jockey

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:38.650
in his John Deere cap and
say, "That's right, Al.

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:40.910
Always with my nose in a book.

00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:44.770
And this day, these days
with my ass in a Mercedes."

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:46.070
[ Laughter ]

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:47.370
So suck on that!

00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:48.670
[ Applause ]

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:59.960
It's an old fantasy, I admit,

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:06.220
but I never pretended
to be Mahatma Gandhi.

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:08.940
[Laughter] When I'm
asked, as I sometimes am,

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:14.190
how you inculcate a love of reading
in a child, I think first of Tabby,

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:16.400
the mother of my three children.

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:19.660
Like me, she always
had her nose in a book.

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:23.210
I met her when we were students
at the University of Maine.

00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:26.140
We were both working
at the Fogler Library.

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:30.130
But I fell in love with her
at a poetry seminar we shared.

00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:34.700
Her poems were lyrical,
elusive, mysterious,

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:38.950
and she wore silk stockings.

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:41.520
One of our rites of courtship
was reading to each other

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:44.340 position:56%
from Eldridge Cleaver's Soul on Ice.

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:48.460
While lying on the college lawn
down by the Civil War cannons.

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:52.100
She had memories of the
Old Town Public Library.

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:56.310
I having grown up in a much
smaller berg had my own

00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:58.720
of the big green bookmobile
that lumbered

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:02.740
down our dirt road once a week in
the summertime and parked in front

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:07.400 position:56%
of the one-room school where Miss
[inaudible] taught all eight grades.

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:11.530
I was in the fifth grade class when
the bookmobile started its visits.

00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:14.560
And was the best student
in my class.

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:18.520
There were three of us.

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:19.820
[ Laughter ]

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:23.900
Tabby and I both had library cards
at the Bangor Public Library.

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:27.940
When we said our I
do's, and because one

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:33.780
of our vows was what's mine is
yours and what's yours is mine,

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:39.920
we merged those cards in what
we called a joint book account.

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:42.850
We had a baby girl
when we were married.

00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:45.300
Had another on the way.

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:48.630
Call us crazy if you
want, but we did.

00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:52.430
And at first the only job I could
get was washing motel sheets

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:56.120
and restaurant tablecloths
in an industrial laundry.

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:59.120
Tab worked part-time
at Dunkin' Donuts.

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:02.800
She had the cutest pink uniform
you ever saw in your life.

00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:06.670
I hardly need to say we
didn't have much money.

00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:10.610
Our car was an old Buick
constantly in danger

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:13.720
of vomiting up its transmission.

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:17.690
Our TV was a black and white
portable that only got one station,

00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:19.570
and for a while we had no phone.

00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:20.870
Credit cards?

00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:22.170
Forget about it.

00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:26.860
But all through that period,
we held onto our memberships

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:31.570
in the Book-of-the-Month Club and
the Literary Guild for dear life.

00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:34.120
And I can still remember
sitting on the rickety porch

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:38.150
of the tenement apartment building
in Bangor, our little girl playing

00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:43.520
in the dirt below us, Tabby reading
some arduous American history tome,

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:46.550
and me reading Larry
McMutry's Moving On.

00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:49.050
That month's Literary
Guild selection.

00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:56.700
I hold no nostalgic affection for
the apartment which was a pit,

00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:58.760
but great affection for the books.

00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:01.330
And I want to point
out that years later,

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:07.920
our eldest son named
his dog McMurtry.

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:11.800
Most of our pets have
names from writers,

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:15.760
and the exception is
our current corgi,

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:18.630
Molly, who is a thing of evil.

00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:22.870 position:56%
The less said about her, the better.

00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:25.570
[ Laughter ]

00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:28.710
Anyway, the kids, the kids.

00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:31.010
We never kept them away
from the television.

00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:32.310
We never did.

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:35.110
We used it unashamedly as
a babysitter between four

00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:39.170
in the afternoon and six in the
evening which was the time of day

00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:42.010
that Tabby's mother,
who raised eight kids,

00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:46.170
used to call "the hours God
never should have made."

00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:47.980
We never told them they must read,

00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:51.320
but they saw that the shelves
were filled with books.

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:54.140
And Mom and Dad never
went any place without one

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:56.700
in hand or tucked under an arm.

00:22:56.700 --> 00:23:01.890 position:56%
We read to them every day of course,
but not to improve their minds,

00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:05.770
but to amuse them, to stop
the constant squabbling,

00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:11.580
and to keep them from ripping the
[bleep] house apart on rainy days.

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:16.390 position:56%
I became a connoisseur of kiddy lit.

00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:18.680
Enjoyed Dr. Seuss.

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:21.500
Loved Maurice Sendak.

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:26.440
Got a kick out of Curious George
who was always up to crazy [bleep].

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:31.520
I could take the Berenstain
Bears or leave them.

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:37.280
The absolute bane of my
existence was Richard Scarry.

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:39.980
[ Laughter ]

00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:47.290
With these crowded and somehow
unsettling pages of turtles, dogs,

00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:52.600
trucks, cats driving
red racing cars.

00:23:52.600 --> 00:24:00.120 position:56%
Bulldozers, serial killers, monsters
from beyond the rim of time.

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:04.820
I have PTSD flashbacks
to those days.

00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:10.010 position:56%
Two kids sitting on my lap, one with
a leaky diaper, both of them wanting

00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:14.960
to know where's the
rabbit in THIS one, Daddy?

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:16.260
Sometimes --

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:17.580
[ Laughter ]

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:23.620
Sometimes, sometimes I felt
like saying, "Let me take a nap.

00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:26.460
I'll think about it."

00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:30.570
One rainy day, desperate to
entertain them before they drove us

00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:34.570
out of their minds, I
bought two Marvel comics

00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:38.260 position:56%
at the local drugstore, not
knowing if the kids would like them.

00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:41.200
They seemed very wordy and
more than a little violent

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:43.550
for children of four and two.

00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:46.230
[ Laughter ]

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:47.760
But my daughter enjoyed them,

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:52.260
and my son went absolutely
bug-[bleep] for them.

00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:56.460
After that, thank god,
Richard Scarry was gone.

00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:58.730
It was all Spiderman
and The Avengers,

00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:01.540
the X-Men, The Fantastic Four.

00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:04.990
I hardly need to tell you,
although I will with some pride

00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:08.110
that our son Joe, under
the name of Joe Hill,

00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:12.180
has gone on to write three
bestselling novels and 37 issues

00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:15.170
of his own comic book
series, Lock &amp; Key.

00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:23.000
[ Applause ]

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.500
Yeah, he broke into the comic
biz writing a Spiderman story

00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:28.080
for Marvel Comic Books.

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:33.620 position:56%
And he's very proud of that, but I
consider it one of his lesser works.

00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:34.920
Comics, man!

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:38.640
I must have read about a thousand
of those suckers before Naomi

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:41.360
and Joe started to
read on their own!

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:44.790
By then Owen had come
along, and he wanted G.I.

00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:47.260
Joe, day in and day out.

00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:53.190
Owen has gone on to write an
acclaimed collection of stories,

00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:55.420
We're All in This Together,
and a wonderful

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:58.170
and very funny novel
called Double Feature.

00:25:58.170 --> 00:26:00.300
And I just finished
collaborating with him

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:04.080
on a very long novel
called Sleeping Beauties.

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:05.380
Yeah.

00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:06.680
[ Applause ]

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:10.690
It's going to be published
next year.

00:26:11.910 --> 00:26:14.070
He came to me with
this dynamite idea,

00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:17.510 position:56%
and there was no way I could say no.

00:26:18.670 --> 00:26:23.260
He's, I think, 37 now, and has
a beautiful little daughter,

00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:26.230
wonderful family, and I'm still
finding his [bleep]ing G.I.

00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:29.800
Joes in the sandbox
down below the house.

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:33.000
Every now and then I find
one of those suckers.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.930
Our daughter, a Wonder Woman fan,

00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:39.270
became a Unitarian minister who's
written many engaging sermons.

00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:41.720
She's interested in
multicultural issues,

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:44.570
racial relations, and
transgender issues.

00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:49.120
But she still enjoys a good
rip-roaring fantasy novel.

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:53.260
And now I am a grandfather
of four, and they also read.

00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:56.410
Not because anyone
told them they must,

00:26:56.410 --> 00:26:58.230 position:56%
but because they grew up with books.

00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:01.320
And when you do that, reading
them is the most natural thing

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:02.650
in the world.

00:27:02.650 --> 00:27:05.220
I'm bragging on my kids, yes.

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:07.860 position:56%
But I'm also trying to make a point.

00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:09.520
You know what I like?

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:11.590
I like when I go into
somebody's house,

00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:14.540
and I ask to use the
bathroom, and I see a bunch

00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:16.840
of books beside the commode.

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:19.750
When I see that, I know I'm with
my peeps, you know what I'm saying?

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:25.420
And that's the truth
at all my kids' house.

00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:32.230
People who read on the toilet, as
far as I'm concerned, good people.

00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:34.850
Good people.

00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:39.140
If kids see you enjoying books, the
chances are they will enjoy books.

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:42.410
As they do, they will begin
to develop a critical sense,

00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:47.140
as I did at ten or so, when I
had an a-ha moment and realized

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:51.770
that the Hardy Boys and Nancy
Drew were full of [bleep].

00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:54.970
The change, changeover happened

00:27:54.970 --> 00:27:59.050
when I began borrowing Ed McBain
novels from the bookmobile.

00:27:59.050 --> 00:28:03.050
Ed McBain wrote about some
detectives at the 87th precinct.

00:28:03.050 --> 00:28:07.010
And one of those books they were
chasing a bad guy, and they broke

00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:10.760
into an apartment and
there's a lady sitting there

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:13.600
in a slip, smoking a cigarette.

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:18.350
And she grabs one of her breasts
and squeezes and goes, "Pow, cops!

00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:21.410
In your eye!"

00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:25.020
I thought to myself,
"Nancy Drew never did that."

00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:27.570
Know what I'm saying?

00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:28.910
It was an a-ha moment.

00:28:28.910 --> 00:28:33.200
I said, "This might
actually be the real world."

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:36.380
This takes me back to what
John Grisham said on that drive

00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:40.370
to the airport about
how we're famous writers

00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:41.930 position:56%
in a country that doesn't read much.

00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:43.680
That haunts me.

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:47.010
Like me, John had no
interest in being famous.

00:28:47.010 --> 00:28:50.110
What he wanted and what I
wanted was only to be able

00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:55.100
to support my family, what we
wanted to do, what we love,

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:56.840
which was writing stories.

00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:59.310
Basically John and I are
a couple of country boys

00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:00.970
who walked out, you know.

00:29:00.970 --> 00:29:03.030
Comes down to about that.

00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:06.020
We're lucky enough to know it.

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:08.510
The peculiar sort of
thing that came along

00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:11.200
with our success was a
troublesome side effect.

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:14.460
And one most writers
don't have to deal with.

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:17.130
In many countries in
Europe and Latin America,

00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:20.230
writers are ionized, even idolized.

00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:22.480
It's not the case here.

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:24.230 position:56%
The majority of Americans don't know

00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:26.690
who Richard Yates is
or Margaret Atwood.

00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:28.990
Canadian, but still cool.

00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:32.770
Cindy [Inaudible], Michael Chabon.

00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:35.130
Nor do they care.

00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:37.880
Somebody recognized
Jonathan Franzen.

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:40.890
He was on Oprah, after all.

00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:45.120
Or maybe John Irving, but most
writers slip by unnoticed.

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:46.420
And maybe that's good.

00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:48.350
Maybe that's good.

00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:50.620
As I said before when I started,

00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:53.660
writers are supposed
to be secret agents.

00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:58.970
I do remember, you
know, my book Carrie,

00:29:58.970 --> 00:30:02.980
I might have only gotten five
people at that first signing.

00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:07.710
It turned out to be a pretty
good seller in paperback.

00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:14.550
And I remember heading up to New
York and getting on a Delta flight.

00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:18.960
And for the first time -- this
is a magical moment for a writer.

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:20.790
There are writers out
there in the audience

00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:23.260
who know what I'm talking about.

00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:28.860
I saw a woman that I
didn't know reading my book.

00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:30.310
She was reading Carrie.

00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:32.470
She was reading a paperback!

00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:33.770
Copy of Carrie!

00:30:33.770 --> 00:30:39.270
[Bleep]! So I said to myself,
"Self, you're going to walk

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:43.110
up to this lady, and say,
'How do you like that book?'"

00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:45.790
And when she says, "I love it!"

00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:48.600
I'm going to say, "I wrote
it, and I'll sign it for you."

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:52.860
Going to make her day.

00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:54.160
Should never do that.

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:55.460
[ Laughter ]

00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:57.990
You should never do that!

00:30:57.990 --> 00:31:01.370
So I walked up to the lady, and I
said, "How do you like that book?"

00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:05.390
And she said, "I think
it's [bleep]."

00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:07.980
[ Laughter ]

00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:10.300
And I said, "Okay.

00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:12.980
Thank you very much
for your opinion."

00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:19.570
I said, "I won't be buying that
one," which was true because I had,

00:31:19.570 --> 00:31:22.230
like, 50 copies sitting at home.

00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:30.730
This is not by and large a country
where finding, seeing writers

00:31:30.730 --> 00:31:34.000
on the street and running after
them, paparazzi, it doesn't --

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.620
it's not really a problem.

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:38.270
Americans don't argue about books.

00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:41.600
We argue about TV shows,
football scores and whether

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:45.040
or not Tom Brady should have
been suspended for four games.

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:46.950
The answer is no!

00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:50.070
[ Laughter ]

00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:54.500
There are, there are few
book shows left on TV.

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:59.130
We have Entertainment Tonight,
and Inside Edition instead.

00:31:59.130 --> 00:32:02.870
Americans are so familiar
with Miley Cyrus, Tom Cruise,

00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:07.220
and Kim Kardashian, -- dashian.

00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:09.090
I don't know.

00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:11.810
The tabloids don't even need
to use their last names!

00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:13.110
See, that's it!

00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:14.740
They're just Miley, Tom, and Kim!

00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:16.380
They're like neighbors
from down the street

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:20.480
from whom we could borrow a
cup of sugar just any old time.

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:23.650
I don't believe in the so-called
dumbing down of America,

00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:27.100
but as everyday reading
declines, and it has,

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:30.510
analytical thought also declines.

00:32:30.510 --> 00:32:31.930
Reading is for fun.

00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:33.540
For me that's a big deal.

00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:37.410
But it also sharpens the nose for
the unmistakable odor of [bleep].

00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:45.160
My wife and I do what we can to
support reading on our little patch

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:49.890
by trying to support
literacy on a local level.

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:54.990
I'm conflicted about discussing
that stuff in front of an audience

00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:58.870
Because on one hand, I grew up
believing that giving was supposed

00:32:58.870 --> 00:33:02.860
to be a private thing and not a
matter for self-aggrandizement.

00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:06.700
Or saying, "Look at what a
great and generous guy I am."

00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:08.460
Which would be ridiculous anyway

00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:13.420 position:56%
because I've been given a great
deal, and I can afford to give back.

00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:16.080
And really, what's the downside?

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:17.860
I'm not going to take it with me.

00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:20.740
There are no pockets in a shroud.

00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:24.100
On the other hand, it's a way
of setting an example of saying,

00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:26.300
"Go and do thou likewise."

00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:29.520
For my wife and me, libraries
were a lifeline at a time

00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:33.920
when we could rarely afford books
or even quarterback paperbacks.

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:36.960
And the same is true
for others today.

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:40.330
We live in a rural state
where many, most even,

00:33:40.330 --> 00:33:43.650 position:56%
small town libraries are flat broke.

00:33:43.650 --> 00:33:46.980
It's because the small towns
can't afford to support them,

00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:51.020 position:56%
and the reason they can't is because
the people in those towns vote

00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:53.590 position:56%
for the dough to go to other places.

00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:58.090 position:56%
Libraries are not seen as a priority
when there are potholes in the road.

00:33:58.090 --> 00:34:01.320
Sure, cash is tight,
but it always is.

00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:03.980
The other part of the
problem is this.

00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:07.330
We live in a society where
many believe that libraries

00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:10.600
and other cultural endeavors,
everything from Shakespeare

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:16.130 position:56%
in the Park to poetry slams and free
concerts are of minor importance.

00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:17.980
As if learning to think is a thing

00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:21.720
that just happens naturally,
like learning to walk.

00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:23.120
Believe me, it's not.

00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:28.440
Learning to think is the result
of hard work and steady effort.

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:33.190
The result of this disregard is too
much illiteracy or semi-illiteracy

00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:38.230 position:56%
in a national population where large
numbers of people are lazy thinkers

00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:41.210
without any of that
nose for [bleep].

00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:43.450
Politicians are allowed to slide

00:34:43.450 --> 00:34:46.800
by with generalities
rather than specific.

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:50.200
Note the way Donald Trump
falls back on saying this

00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:52.880
and such is going to be HUGE!

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:55.950
Or this and such is BEAUTIFUL.

00:34:55.950 --> 00:35:01.210 position:56%
You know, any writer or reader worth
his salt can only roll his eyes

00:35:01.210 --> 00:35:05.460 position:56%
and say, "Those words by
themselves mean absolutely nothing."

00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:09.090
Trump makes me wince not
as a Democrat, which I am,

00:35:09.090 --> 00:35:11.250
but as a writer and reader.

00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:12.610
Listening to his speeches --

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:13.910
[ Applause ]

00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:23.960
Listening to his speeches
is like listening

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:26.690
to a piano fall downstairs.

00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:29.670
It's all dissonance and no music.

00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:31.200
God, I'm going to miss Obama.

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:33.130
I mean, the man could talk.

00:35:33.130 --> 00:35:35.020
Say whatever you want to.

00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:40.070
[ Applause ]

00:35:40.070 --> 00:35:41.370
The guy knew how to talk.

00:35:41.370 --> 00:35:42.670
It was poetry.

00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:46.260
There's always been music
in the stuff that he says.

00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:49.740
We're not dealing in generalities
elected officials who are supposed

00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:55.020
to be the best, the smartest, often
resort to outright misinformation

00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:58.360
as when the governor of my own
state, Paul LePage, I love this.

00:35:58.360 --> 00:35:59.660
I love this.

00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:01.130
He told a town hall audience

00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:05.210
that asylum seekers were
bringing the Zeke fly to Maine.

00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:09.770
The statement is mindboggling
in its own right.

00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:13.150
That Governor Le Page might
have believed it is more so.

00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:17.860 position:56%
That many accept it as a fact is
the most mind-boggling thing of all.

00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:20.920
It's like watching a grownup
nod and say, "Yes, Santa,

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:24.840
small sleigh, that
makes sense, yeah."

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:27.380
The ability to think
clearly and logically leads

00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:29.940
to good decision making,
and I believe the ability

00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:33.770
to think clearly goes along
with the ability to read.

00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:35.070
[ Applause ]

00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:46.490
The question, the question becomes
how to grow literacy in America.

00:36:46.490 --> 00:36:49.740
Supporting those small town
libraries is the way my wife

00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:51.470
and I chose to do it.

00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:54.480
Tip O'Neil once said,
"All politics is local."

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:57.890
And while he may have
chosen the wrong verb,

00:36:57.890 --> 00:37:01.010
it's still an acute,
an acute observation.

00:37:01.010 --> 00:37:02.550
Literacy is local, too.

00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:06.320
It's why I tell people to
support their local library,

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:10.010
not just by going there, but
kicking into the general fund

00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:13.960
when the place needs a new
roof, new bathroom plumbing,

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:16.280 position:56%
or computers in the children's room.

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:18.520
Don't expect local
governments to do it,

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:21.800
because in most cases
they can't or they won't.

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:26.330 position:56%
The local thing is well, I patronize
independent bookstores in my part

00:37:26.330 --> 00:37:29.070
of the world and urge
others to do the same.

00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:30.530
It's why I visit schools.

00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:33.900
I tell them to turn off their
[bleep] TV and put Facebook

00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:37.710
on hold two or three evenings
a week and rediscover the joys

00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:40.310
of Treasure Island or Lord
of the Flies or an article

00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:42.520
about the presidential campaign.

00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:45.760
And of course, the most
local literary endeavors

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:49.600
of all involve reading
to your own family.

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:53.520
As I said, kids who see family
members reading books are more apt

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:55.570
to read books themselves.

00:37:55.570 --> 00:37:59.220
I wanted to -- I don't
want to keep you too long.

00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:01.590
Fanny fatigue and all that.

00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:06.580
You know, I was talking about being
a secret agent and all that stuff.

00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:13.640
And how writers kind of
slide by in this society

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:19.340
and sometimes that's
really a pretty great thing.

00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:20.940
My wife and I were down in Florida.

00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:24.750
This was before the law insisted
that we had to move there.

00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:27.950
You know. We were down there
for a vacation, and it was --

00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:33.370
I think, I think it was in
the '80s because I think

00:38:33.370 --> 00:38:35.660
by that time I had
switched publishers

00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:38.440
to Scribners, Simon &amp; Schuster.

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:42.250
But my wife and I were going
to a movie, and you know,

00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:47.610
we were just headed there, walking
down the street hand in hand.

00:38:47.610 --> 00:38:51.340
And there was this Lincoln
Continental on the curb

00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:53.300
that was sitting on a flat tire.

00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:56.440
And this guy who was in a
dinner jacket, you know,

00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:58.900
he was obviously going to a do.

00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:00.320 position:56%
You know, he had a dinner jacket on.

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:02.870
He looked really nice
and everything.

00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:06.940
I'm walking along, my wife's
in her jeans, I'm in my jeans.

00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:11.230
I'm wearing a t-shirt with some
Red Sox guy on it or something.

00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:15.340
And this guy looks at me,
and he says, "Hey, bud!

00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:17.160
You want to make ten dollars?"

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:19.900
[ Laughter ]

00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:23.370
And I said, "What?"

00:39:23.370 --> 00:39:29.570
And he said, "You change my
tire, I'll give you ten dollars."

00:39:29.570 --> 00:39:33.050
Said, "If you change it
in 15 minutes, my wife

00:39:33.050 --> 00:39:35.250 position:56%
and I have got to go to this things.

00:39:35.250 --> 00:39:37.250
I can't get my dinner jacket dirty.

00:39:37.250 --> 00:39:41.850
If you can do it in 15
minutes, I'll give you 20."

00:39:41.850 --> 00:39:45.850
And I mean, the guy's got,
like, the Rolex watch.

00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:49.770
He's got the, you know,
the thing around his neck,

00:39:49.770 --> 00:39:51.180
the gold chain and everything.

00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:53.140
And the hair's all combed up.

00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:59.090
And so I said, "Okay, I'll
do that, I'll do that."

00:39:59.090 --> 00:40:00.900
Fifteen minutes, eh?

00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:03.060
And I say, "You got a jack
and a spare and everything?

00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:04.360
"Yeah, yeah, yeah," he says.

00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:06.050
"I got all that stuff."

00:40:06.050 --> 00:40:08.260
So he opens the trunk.

00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:10.570
The car is running.

00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:14.260
His wife is sitting inside
in the passenger seat.

00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:16.400
It's Naples, Florida.

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:18.140
It's like 90 degrees.

00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:19.460
She's wearing a fur coat.

00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:22.010
That's why she's sitting in the
car, the air conditioning is going.

00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:24.750
I said, "Well look, the
flat's on this side.

00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:27.520
Maybe your wife would
like to get out.

00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:30.130
It might be better
while I jack it up."

00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:31.430
Looks in and speaks to her.

00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:33.140
She's going, "Umm-Umm.

00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:40.520
No way." So I jacked up the
car, and I got the tire off.

00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:42.430
My wife's rolling her
eyes like [inaudible].

00:40:42.430 --> 00:40:48.540
And this guy is like tapping me on
the shoulder and going like this

00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:50.630
with his watch, you know?

00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:52.060
"Hurry it up, son."

00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:55.210
So I get the spare on, and
I tighten the lug nuts,

00:40:55.210 --> 00:40:56.630
and put on the hub cap.

00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:58.720
And my wife asks me, and
says, "You're not really going

00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:00.020
to take that money, are you?"

00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:01.320
And I said, "You're
[bleep]ing right I am."

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:02.620
[ Laughter ]

00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:09.120
I said, "This is the first honest
work I've done in 20 years!"

00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:10.420
[ Laughter ]

00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:14.880
So that's one side of it.

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:18.510
Now, I rattled on longer
than I meant.

00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:21.300
But I do, I've got to tell
you this one more story.

00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:24.670
See, once I get started,
I can't stop.

00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:26.380
But --

00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:28.780
[ Cheers ]

00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:34.880
This is the other side
of that coin, okay?

00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:37.900
I wrote a book called
Christine, back in the day.

00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:39.200
And --

00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:40.500
[ Applause ]

00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:46.470
It's like being in a
Lynyrd Skynyrd movie.

00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:48.770
Playing Freebird.

00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:54.450
In a way. In a small way.

00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:56.440
So anyway, I wrote this
book called Christine,

00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:59.420
had all these song lyrics
at the beginning of it.

00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:04.210
And I knew this guy
named Dave Marsh,

00:42:04.210 --> 00:42:08.120
and I wanted to use some
lyrics from a songwriter

00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:11.630
and singer named Bruce Springsteen.

00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:13.290
And so I got in touch with Dave.

00:42:13.290 --> 00:42:18.900
And you know, a lot of the people,
song privileges, when you use them,

00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:22.320
the permissions that they want,
they ask you for a lot of money.

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:24.880
But Bruce and Bob Dylan have
always been good about that.

00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:26.590
They ask for, like, fifty dollars

00:42:26.590 --> 00:42:29.100
because they control
all their rights.

00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:33.320
And so I got the rights to
the song, and Dave Marsh said,

00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:36.520
"The next time you're in New York,

00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:38.040
Bruce would like to
have dinner with you.

00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:39.860
Would you like to have dinner
with Bruce Springsteen?"

00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:42.620
I'm like, "Well, let me think
about that a little bit.

00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:44.320
Gee, I don't know."

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:50.380
This was around the time of
the Nebraska album, so he had,

00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:53.220
you know, come on the scene.

00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:54.520
I loved his work, man.

00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:55.820
I don't know how you can grow

00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:59.210
up in a working class
community and not like Bruce.

00:42:59.210 --> 00:43:02.920
Anyway, so that happened, actually.

00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:06.300
So Dave gets in touch with
me, and he says, "Well,

00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:09.110
it's this little supper place.

00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:14.440
It's like an Irish steam table
kind of place on the Eastside."

00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:18.540
So I went down there,
and Bruce was sitting

00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:20.840
at the bar and having a white wine.

00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:23.780
And we went and sat in the
back, and we ordered our food.

00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:27.960 position:56%
And we're talking about books and
music and movies and all this stuff.

00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:30.990
We're having a great time.

00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:34.150
And these three people came in,

00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:40.680
and you knew there was a story
right there because it was a man

00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:42.880
and a woman, and they're
middle-aged.

00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:47.540
And it was a girl of about 16
who was dressed to the nines

00:43:47.540 --> 00:43:49.820 position:56%
in a nice dress with an empire waist

00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:52.930
and the hair was done,
and she looked so happy.

00:43:52.930 --> 00:43:55.870
Her parents were happy, too.

00:43:55.870 --> 00:44:00.480
And they sat down somewhere
and ordered,

00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:01.780
and there was a birthday cake.

00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:03.080
It was her birthday.

00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:04.600
She was like 16 or 17 years old.

00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:06.680
And you know how they
do in a restaurant.

00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:09.770
There's the cake, there's
the candles, and two or three

00:44:09.770 --> 00:44:13.560 position:56%
of the wait staff sing Happy
Birthday, and you know, people clap,

00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:16.330
and Bruce and I and
Dave Marsh clapped.

00:44:16.330 --> 00:44:18.850
And they had their cake.

00:44:18.850 --> 00:44:23.580
So she happened to
look over our way.

00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:30.460
And her eyes just widened, and she
got up, and I'll never forget it

00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:34.620
because it was like she was
in this dream, you know.

00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:36.300
And she just walked toward us.

00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:38.740
It was like she was walking on air.

00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:40.960
And Bruce was wearing
a denim jacket,

00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:43.360
and he reached inside
to get his pen.

00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:47.080
She never [bleep]ing looked at him.

00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:48.380
[ Laughter ]

00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:50.180
Okay? She never did!

[ Applause ]

00:44:54.550 --> 00:44:58.730
She said, she said,
"Are you Stephen King?"

00:44:58.730 --> 00:45:00.250
I said, "Why, yeah."

00:45:00.250 --> 00:45:05.270 position:56%
She said, "Did you write The Stand?"

00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:10.530
And Bruce Springsteen is just
killing himself laughing.

00:45:10.530 --> 00:45:12.850
She said, "Can I have
your autograph?"

00:45:12.850 --> 00:45:24.120
Best autograph that I ever gave.

00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:25.420
[ Laughter ]

00:45:25.420 --> 00:45:27.530
And you're the best
audience that I've ever had.

00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:28.830
This is great.

00:45:28.830 --> 00:45:30.130
[ Applause ]

00:45:30.130 --> 00:45:41.750
I got this wonderful
medal, and I get to be here.

00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:43.930
And boy, I'll tell you what.

00:45:43.930 --> 00:45:46.600
I'm a cheap date, and
this is really nice.

00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:50.130
We're going to be done.

00:45:50.130 --> 00:45:52.210
We've got about ten minutes.

00:45:52.210 --> 00:45:53.590
Do you have a question or two?

00:45:53.590 --> 00:46:00.940
Something you want to ask me?

00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:03.780
[ Laughter ]

00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:06.460
Nobody? Hello?

00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:07.760
Uh, hello?

00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:09.230
Hi! Hey!

00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:11.200
&gt;&gt; Geez, that's loud!

00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:15.280
Crazy! Anyway, I was just
wondering if you have any plans to,

00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:17.680
or can tell us a progress report

00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:22.140
on the third Jack Sawyer
novel with Peter Straub?

00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:25.500
&gt;&gt; Stephen King: Yeah, Peter and I
wrote a book called The Talisman.

00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:31.300
Then we wrote another one called
Black House, and with any luck,

00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:34.410
we will start the third
one in February next year.

00:46:34.410 --> 00:46:37.310
[ Applause ]

00:46:37.310 --> 00:46:41.470
We know just what it's
supposed to be, so.

00:46:41.470 --> 00:46:43.310
Anything else?

00:46:43.310 --> 00:46:47.420 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Being from New Jersey, and
you're a huge Bruce Springsteen fan,

00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:49.820
what's your favorite
Bruce Springsteen song?

00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:55.370
&gt;&gt; Stephen King: That's crazy,
that's like asking you know,

00:46:55.370 --> 00:46:57.340
what's the best movie
that you ever saw?

00:46:57.340 --> 00:47:02.000
There are so many Bruce Springsteen
songs that I like, that I love.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:07.090
I guess maybe Rosalita,
Come Out Tonight.

00:47:07.090 --> 00:47:09.350
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:47:09.350 --> 00:47:16.410
&gt;&gt; We were going down to
Florida with my teenage son.

00:47:16.410 --> 00:47:19.460
And of course, didn't have
devices then and so on.

00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:21.470
And he said, "Well,
how about a book?

00:47:21.470 --> 00:47:22.990
I've got some Stephen King books?"

00:47:22.990 --> 00:47:25.130
And he said, "No, I don't
think I want to read that."

00:47:25.130 --> 00:47:26.440
&gt;&gt; Stephen King: Yeah, you
don't want to read that.

00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:29.290
&gt;&gt; So what I gave him, I
gave him the Bachman Books,

00:47:29.290 --> 00:47:32.370
and it was like a gateway
drug to your books.

00:47:32.370 --> 00:47:33.670
[ Laughter ]

00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:36.420
&gt;&gt; Stephen King: That's the first
time anybody ever called me a

00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:37.740
gateway drug!

00:47:37.740 --> 00:47:42.340
&gt;&gt; So I just wanted to ask the
background, why you used that --

00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:44.230
&gt;&gt; Stephen King: He started
out on Bachman and then he was

00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:46.170
on heroin of Stephen King.

00:47:46.170 --> 00:47:47.470
[ Applause ]

00:47:47.470 --> 00:47:51.620
&gt;&gt; No, I just wondered if you
could give me a little background

00:47:51.620 --> 00:47:54.290
on why you decided to
do the Bachman Books.

00:47:54.290 --> 00:47:58.630
&gt;&gt; Stephen King: Well, the
thing was there was a time

00:47:58.630 --> 00:48:02.440
when publishers thought that if you
published more than one book a year

00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:06.150
or possibly every 18 months,
you were overpublishing.

00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:08.070
And I had this period that I went

00:48:08.070 --> 00:48:09.910
through that was extremely
productive,

00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:14.190
and this stuff just
poured out of me.

00:48:14.190 --> 00:48:20.460
The new stuff that was being
published year by year, Carrie,

00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:24.530
Salem's Lot, The Shining, The
Stand, Nightshift, and all that.

00:48:24.530 --> 00:48:26.320
But I had these other books,

00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:29.270
some of which had been
written on my teenage years.

00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:31.940
They all weren't good.

00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:37.680
And some never should see the
light of day and never will.

00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:40.210
But there were a couple
like Long Walk and --

00:48:40.210 --> 00:48:41.510
[ Applause ]

00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:47.340
Road Work that I thought
were pretty good.

00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:51.690
So they got, they were
published as paperback originals.

00:48:51.690 --> 00:48:55.990
And the original name that I
decided to publish those books

00:48:55.990 --> 00:48:59.590
under was my grandfather's
name, Guy Pillsbury.

00:48:59.590 --> 00:49:04.140
And I got a panic call
from the editor two

00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:07.800
or three days before the books
went to press and said, "Oh,

00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:11.100
the copyright got out,
and it's under your name.

00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:15.830
And people will find out this
is -- that Guy Pillsbury is you.

00:49:15.830 --> 00:49:18.830
So you need another name,
and you need it right away."

00:49:18.830 --> 00:49:24.950
And I was reading a paperback
novel by Richard Stark,

00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:28.390
and Bachman Turner
Overdrive was on the stereo.

00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:32.010
So I said, "Call me Richard
Bachman," and that's what happened.

00:49:32.010 --> 00:49:39.140
[ Applause ]

00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:42.600
&gt;&gt; Do you read books
once or over and over?

00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:47.360
&gt;&gt; Stephen King: I read
very few over and over.

00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:50.630
There are books like
Lord of the Flies.

00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:57.990
There's a wonderful novel by Thomas
Williams called Whipple's Castle.

00:49:57.990 --> 00:50:05.690
The Hannibal Lecter
Trilogy by Thomas Harris.

00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:09.790
Those books I've read
over and over again.

00:50:09.790 --> 00:50:14.870
But there are so many books that
I have more of a tendency to --

00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:19.550
you know, like anybody else,
I have favorite writers that I

00:50:19.550 --> 00:50:23.440
like that I have a tendency
to go back to again and again.

00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:25.020
People like John Sanford.

00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:28.850
I never miss a John Sanford book.

00:50:28.850 --> 00:50:37.010 position:56%
There's a writer, Dutch writer named
Herman Koch that I really enjoy.

00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:39.000
Of course, like everybody
else in the world,

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:42.170
I read those books
about Lisbeth Salander.

00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:45.920
I didn't think the guy
was much of a writer,

00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:47.620
but geez, could he ever narrate!

00:50:47.620 --> 00:50:48.920
So I like those.

00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:56.080
So I have a tendency to move along
because you only get so many books.

00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:59.860
I'm haunted sometimes by the
thought of all the great books

00:50:59.860 --> 00:51:03.160
that I've missed somewhere
along the line.

00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:07.380
But it's like having misplaced
socks, but only worse.

00:51:07.380 --> 00:51:09.050
Something else?

00:51:09.050 --> 00:51:13.060
I'm going as fast as I
can because they're going

00:51:13.060 --> 00:51:15.930
to kick us all out of here.

00:51:15.930 --> 00:51:17.520
&gt;&gt; I didn't have a single question.

00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:30.690
I just wanted you to stand still so
I could get an unfettered picture.

still is foreign to my nature.

first as a writer,

00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:16.230
you've been a great inspiration,
so thank you very much.

00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:17.530

welcome, thank you.

00:52:17.530 --> 00:52:20.790

what scares you?

[ Laughter ]

00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:30.940
I mean, the little things
like, there are little things

00:52:30.940 --> 00:52:36.300
like you say, "Okay, I'm standing
in front of 1000, 2000 people.

00:52:36.300 --> 00:52:39.710
Did I zip my fly before
I came out here?"

00:52:39.710 --> 00:52:42.490
And you know, to be
absolutely dead serious,

00:52:42.490 --> 00:52:46.450
I'm scared to death of
Alzheimer's Disease.

Senility. I live by my wits, and
I'm afraid of my wits slipping away.

Otherwise, I'm afraid of -- geez,
I guess just about everything!

00:53:03.690 --> 00:53:06.490
Spiders are a great
big no-no with me.

00:53:06.490 --> 00:53:08.720
I hate the idea of
spiders, and of course a lot

00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:14.330
of this stuff was inculcated
in me at a very young age.

00:53:14.330 --> 00:53:20.660
My mother started us off on
Bambi, and then moved directly

00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:23.430
onto Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:27.360
And one of her favorite
stories was she talked about --

00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:30.510
she was one of, I think,
eight or nine kids.

00:53:30.510 --> 00:53:31.830
Grew up in Scarborough, Maine.

00:53:31.830 --> 00:53:34.160
This was around the
turn of the century.

00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:39.330
And once a week a guy came
along, and he would trade stuff.

00:53:39.330 --> 00:53:42.120
And he had gum for the kids.

00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:45.780
And you had to chew that
piece of gum all week.

00:53:45.780 --> 00:53:47.710
So my mother had this gum.

00:53:47.710 --> 00:53:51.650
You know, you chew it and put
it on the bedpost at night.

00:53:51.650 --> 00:53:56.480 position:56%
And it would harden up, and the next
morning you'd have to pop it in,

00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:59.230
soften it up so it was
good to go for another day.

00:53:59.230 --> 00:54:02.750
And one night after my mother
put her gum on the bedpost,

00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:06.160
a moth came down and
lit on it and got stuck.

00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:09.600
And when she woke up the next
morning, she didn't look.

00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:12.610
She just popped her
gum into her mouth.

00:54:12.610 --> 00:54:14.810
She said she bit it in half,

00:54:14.810 --> 00:54:19.240
and the two halves were
fluttering inside her mouth.

00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:23.230
And I thought to myself, "Mom, at
some point I'm going to use that."

00:54:23.230 --> 00:54:24.530
[ Laughter ]

00:54:24.530 --> 00:54:26.380
And that's just what I did.

00:54:26.380 --> 00:54:27.680
One more.

00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:29.730
&gt;&gt; Alright, thank you
very much real quick.

00:54:29.730 --> 00:54:33.550

that's had so many movies written

00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:41.570
from their books, how nervous or
worried do you get when someone

00:54:41.570 --> 00:54:43.870
like Roland, who you've
spent so much time with,

00:54:43.870 --> 00:54:46.240
is going to be put
up on the big screen?

00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:47.540
&gt;&gt; Stephen King: Well,
I'm more nervous

00:54:47.540 --> 00:54:50.230
about this than I am most of them.

00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:58.020 position:56%
In most cases, my feeling is if
somebody buys a book to make a movie

00:54:58.020 --> 00:55:02.850
out of or a TV series, it's like
sending a kid off to college, okay?

00:55:02.850 --> 00:55:06.060 position:56%
You hope that they're going to do a
good job, and that they're not going

00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:08.290
to get into trouble, and
they're not go to get expelled

00:55:08.290 --> 00:55:12.380
and they're not going to be
arrested or anything like that.

00:55:12.380 --> 00:55:15.620
But every now and then,
that happens.

00:55:15.620 --> 00:55:17.050
You just hope for the best.

00:55:17.050 --> 00:55:22.850
And man, I've had terrific luck,
you know, between Shawshank,

00:55:22.850 --> 00:55:25.300
which I really did
write, by the way.

00:55:25.300 --> 00:55:28.360
And the Green Mile and
Misery and Stand by Me.

00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:31.700
There have been a bunch
of stuff -- thank you.

00:55:31.700 --> 00:55:36.820
But remember, I didn't
write those movies.

00:55:36.820 --> 00:55:38.880
I just wrote the source,
although I think a lot

00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:40.660
of times the movies are better.

00:55:40.660 --> 00:55:43.140
This is just my personal opinion.

00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:45.360
But when they stick
closer to the source,

00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:47.420
they tend to be a little better.

00:55:47.420 --> 00:55:55.940
But the fans of The Dark
Tower are so, so loyal, so --

00:55:55.940 --> 00:55:59.270
I started to say rabid, but
that was the wrong word.

00:55:59.270 --> 00:56:02.140
Made me think of Cujo.

00:56:02.140 --> 00:56:06.990
But they care about those books,
so I want the movies to be good.

00:56:06.990 --> 00:56:09.550
I'm a little bit nervous about it.

00:56:09.550 --> 00:56:13.600
But you know, it's a thrill.

00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:14.900
It's going to be a thrill.

00:56:14.900 --> 00:56:17.540
I've seen some of the
dailies and some of the rushes

00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:19.450
from the movie, and it looks right.

00:56:19.450 --> 00:56:22.150
So I've got my fingers crossed.

00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:23.660
Listen, you guys have
been great to me.

00:56:23.660 --> 00:56:24.960
Thank you so much!

00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:26.260
[ Applause ]

00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:28.560
Thank you.

00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:33.450

of the Library of Congress.
