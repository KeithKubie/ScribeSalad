00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.900
&gt;&gt; Hello, everyone.
Welcome to today's Authors at Google Talk.

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.640
I'm pleased to introduce Christopher McDougall,
the author of "Born To Run.”

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.800
His writing apparently has inspired a handful
of Googlers to compete in relay races as long

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.100
as 200 miles, with some success, as I discovered
over lunch.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.130
And so, I'm pleased to hear what else he has
to say.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:27.340
And maybe we can do 400 next time.
So please join me in welcoming Christopher

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.340
McDougall.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.340
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.580
&gt;&gt; This all sound okay, yeah?
It's not echoing kind of weird?

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.320
Sound like Howard Stern for a second.
Well, first of all, I want to personally thank

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.260
you guys.
My wife and daughters want to personally thank

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.840
you.
Without Google, this book -- which is already

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.490
one year past deadline -- God only knows when
the hell it would have been done.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.469
So, thank you very much.
I think Barefoot Ted is here today.

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:50.649
He would also like to thank you.
Barefoot Ted has actually not bought a book

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:54.191
since you guys went beta.
So he's grateful as well.

00:00:54.191 --> 00:01:00.829
You know -- I hate to do this, I hate to stir
up controversy and piss people off -- but,

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.519
there's been people talking some crap about
you guys behind your backs.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.720
So, I just think you should be aware of it.
You know, we'll deal with it.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:13.860
But, this is what's being said about you people,
okay?

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.200
This is from David Willey, who's executive
editor of Runner's World Magazine.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.030
He says, "The concern I have is that a lot
of people maybe hear about this book called

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.000
"Born to Run" -- which is that bestselling
book -- and feel like, "Oh, I can just throw

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.479
my running shoes away, and I'll just start
tomorrow, and I'll become a barefoot runner.”

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.150
If a lot of runners -- or all the runners
out there in America -- did that tomorrow,

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.740
the vast majority of them will get hurt very
quickly and would have to stop running for

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.560
a very long time."
Now, why is that?

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:52.420
The problem with you people is that you are
not efficient and biomechanically-gifted runners.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.420
The vast majority of people are not blessed
in that way.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.340
So, unfortunately -- despite all appearances
to the contrary -- I and Barefoot Ted are

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.200
perfect.
We are gifted and blessed, and you guys are

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.200
a bunch of fuckups.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.489
&gt;&gt; [Laughter]

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:10.409
&gt;&gt; According to the executive editor of Runner’s
World Magazine -- who must know a lot about

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:14.609
running -- and also, according to Dr. Louis
Maharem, who's the medical consultant for

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:20.220
the New York City Marathon, and who's billed
as the world's premier running physician -- and

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.650
he said exactly the same thing, that if most
Americans tried to run in their bare feet,

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.299
95 percent of the them would end up in his
office, because they are not "biomechanically

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.499
gifted.”
Which, you know, I'm sure -- hopefully, a

00:02:33.499 --> 00:02:35.590
lot of you guys out there are engineers -- when
you hear that.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.410
For the layperson, I hear I'm gifted and blessed
and biomechanically efficient.

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.120
It must mean that I must have some super-engineered,
kind of, prolific bone structure, you know,

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.889
that makes me superhuman.
Sort of, you know, Siborian.

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:54.430
But, hopefully, you engineers realize those
words don't mean anything.

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.099
"Biomechanically efficient" means like, if
I'm trying to have a beer, and I keep putting

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:00.660
it over here, it just means you just go like
that [demonstrating], you know?

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.660
&gt;&gt; [Laughter].

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.650
&gt;&gt; It just means you do it right.
And I love this idea that, if you're not "It,"

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.299
if you're not doing it right, well, too bad,
you never will.”

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:14.250
You know, it's like taking a kid and throwing
him in the pool and watching the bubbles come

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.370
up and go, "Sorry, you're not biomechanically
efficient," you know?

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:20.370
&gt;&gt; [Laughter].

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:21.370
&gt;&gt; "And you never will be.”
You know, what happens when you throw a kid

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.029
into the pool, and he starts to sink?
You fish the kid out, do some compressions,

00:03:26.029 --> 00:03:29.999
and you teach him how to swim, right? You
teach him how to do it properly.

00:03:29.999 --> 00:03:33.419
You know, if you're playing tennis, and that
ball keeps sailing over the fence, "That's

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:35.890
the way it goes.”
No. They teach you how to serve the ball.

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.199
And they don't say, "Buy a new racket.”
They teach you how to do it properly.

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:47.620
So I've been hearing a lot of this backlash
recently, and it's surprising to me that we've

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:54.349
gotten to this point where the prevailing
notion of the human body is that it's born

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:58.769
broken and that's the way it goes, and all
you can hope to do is minimize the damage.

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.949
And that's for almost -- not just running,
but -- almost any form of exercise, you know?

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:05.349
"You can't do too much." "You're going to
hurt yourself.”

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:10.290
You need a machine to sit on and pulleys to
make sure you don't like, break anything.

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.369
When you run, you need to have these gigantic,
prosthetic, pogo stick things on your feet.

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:18.380
Even walking shoes now.
Have you seen these -- what do you call those

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:24.430
things? -- those -- Rocker Shoes! I don't
want to offend anybody who's here, but I don't

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.639
get it.
That's essentially a rocking chair for your

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.520
feet.
It's what like seventy-year-old women knit

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:35.349
in -- on your feet.
So you can't learn how to use the stinkin'

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:38.430
thing yourself.
That's been the prevailing mindset, and I

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:43.490
think it's gotten us to a point where we've
taken this activity called "running," and

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.490
we look at it like you're removing your own
appendix, you know?

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.150
"It's dangerous" and "You probably shouldn't
attempt it on your own.”

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.509
Guys here, I mean, how many people here really
genuinely love to run?

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:56.410
All right. That's pretty good. That's pretty
good.

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.129
You really love it, or you sort of do it?
Do you like it a lot?

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:02.460
Okay, that's pretty impressive.
Because, again, if this was a group of five-year-olds,

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.660
the kids would be out of their seats jumping
around, you know?

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:11.819
What's unusual with humans today is that -- somewhere
between the age of five and 25 -- we go from

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:15.099
really loving it to like, "Ah shit, I got
to do it.”

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:18.780
And that's what I'm sort of curious about
is like, What exactly goes on?

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:24.610
Where is that transition period?
And that was the same question that a much

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.729
smarter and more knowledgeable guy than I
am -- particularly about running -- a guy

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:34.500
named Dr. Joe Vigil, a man with various Ph.D.'s
and master's degrees sort of bristling out

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.150
of his resume.
He's the most successful -- and probably most

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:43.919
beloved -- running coach in American history.
He was the track and cross-country coach at

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:46.860
Adam State College.
Have any of you ever heard of Adam State College?

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.490
Okay, proves my point.
Okay, it's a nondescript, tiny, little school

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.910
in Alamosa, Colorado.
But, the one thing they're known for is, they

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.620
can kick the crap out of anybody in cross-country
races.

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:03.759
Dr. Joe Vigil is the only guy who'll take
walk-on runners, and he blanked out the field

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:07.590
in the NCAA Cross-Country Championships.
Meaning, the first five people who crossed

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:11.689
the line were his five runners.
So essentially, the race was over and done

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:15.020
before the first guy from the other team even
showed up.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:21.909
Dr. Joe Vigil is successful because he has
a raging sense of vulnerability.

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:25.990
He can't believe that's there's not something
out there that someone's going to figure out

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:31.009
before him, and it's going to thrash him.
And that's the reason why one of the few times

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:34.669
that these reclusive runners known as the
“Tarahumara,” one of the few times they've

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:40.129
ever turned up at the Leadville Trail 100
Ultra Marathon, Dr. Joe Vigil was there, which

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:44.620
meant that, at the age of nearly seventy,
this old man was standing out in the Colorado

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:49.349
Rockies at 12,000 feet in the dark at four
o'clock in the morning, waiting for a bunch

00:06:49.349 --> 00:06:55.289
of guys to come running by in robes and sandals.
What he saw then -- he saw the Tarahumara

00:06:55.289 --> 00:07:01.000
come ripping by him at mile sixty.
Okay, this is sixty miles into a one-hundred

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.889
mile race on steep terrain.
And the moment he saw them is a part of the

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:10.090
course where you just passed the sixty mile
mark, and you've got to go up this really

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:14.580
steep dirt embankment that seems to be there
for no other reason other than to just really

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:20.009
beat the crap out of runners.
And no matter how good a race you're having,

00:07:20.009 --> 00:07:25.129
that embankment is just rituous torture.
And what Vigil saw when he saw the Tarahumara

00:07:25.129 --> 00:07:29.909
come running up there was something he had
never seen on a runner's face, ever.

00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:34.050
And of all the things he would have picked
out, I was impressed by the fact that he was

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:40.280
not interested in the Tarahumara's nutritional
strategy on their race tactics on their biomechanics

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:43.889
on their physiology on their footwear.
What he couldn't understand was What the hell

00:07:43.889 --> 00:07:47.120
were these guys so happy about?
Why are they smiling?

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:51.919
The worst possible part of the course these
guys are having a blast.

00:07:51.919 --> 00:07:58.479
And I remember him saying that, "It's as if
running to the death makes them feel more

00:07:58.479 --> 00:08:03.719
alive.”
And he had zeroed in on something really crucial

00:08:03.719 --> 00:08:07.729
 -- not just the fact that these guys are
having fun, which is pretty important.

00:08:07.729 --> 00:08:11.639
Because if you want someone to be successful
at something -- as your cafeteria demonstrates

00:08:11.639 --> 00:08:15.050
 -- Make people want to be here, you know?
Make people want to actually do their show

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:18.900
for the job.
So what Vigil saw was the smiles.

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:22.169
And he was thinking to himself, "You know,
I've never seen a runner enjoy it that much.

00:08:22.169 --> 00:08:27.289
And if my runners enjoyed it as much as these
guys, God only knows what they could do.”

00:08:27.289 --> 00:08:31.499
But secondly -- the second point too, he says,
"Running to the death makes them feel more

00:08:31.499 --> 00:08:34.469
alive.”
And at that point, he was starting to spiral

00:08:34.469 --> 00:08:38.389
down in something that's really unusual about
the Tarahumara.

00:08:38.389 --> 00:08:45.420
You know, the Tarahumara are a tribe which
have essentially lived in isolation at the

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:55.949
bottom of this deep, dangerous, very inaccessible
network of canyons in north-westernish Mexico

00:08:55.949 --> 00:09:00.399
called the "Copper Canyons."
Back in the 1600s, when the conquistadors

00:09:00.399 --> 00:09:03.079
arrived and started taking heads, there were
two options.

00:09:03.079 --> 00:09:06.020
You could fight back like the Mayans and the
Aztecs, or you could turn around and take

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:10.550
off, like the Tarahumara did.
Very few Mayans and Aztecs around today, but

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:17.720
the Tarahumara have managed to hide themselves
and live down there, almost untouched by the

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:21.120
modern world.
So, essentially, they are living today exactly

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:27.390
the way they did 400 years ago in the 1600s.
That's really tantalizing, because you know,

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:32.540
we can blather on all we want about what history
says and what humans evolved to do.

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:37.300
Most of it is basically, you come up with
an idea of how you think humans should do,

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:41.000
and then you go back and try to gin together
some fossils and prove it.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.860
But what's interesting about the Tarahumara
is they are there.

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:49.100
They are our living proof.
They are a Smithsonian exhibit come to life.

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:53.180
And so, if we want to actually figure out
what humans were doing in the 1600s, there

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:56.190
they are.
Go ahead and ask them.

00:09:56.190 --> 00:10:01.300
What they have -- besides their unbelievable
ability to run super-long distances -- and

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:06.740
I'm talking about 150 or 200-miles at a time,
on essentially a starvation diet.

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:09.160
We're told that the marathon is the ultimate
challenge?

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:13.320
Well, try knocking about a dozen of those
out, one after the other, in the same day.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:21.579
Besides their ability to do that, the Tarahumara
are also free from greed, crime, violence,

00:10:21.579 --> 00:10:26.190
warfare, heart disease, high cholesterol,
diabetes, clinical depression, almost every

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:29.970
single form of cancer, domestic abuse.
Everything.

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:34.500
You could do a whole itemized list of all
the things we're trying to get rid of in modern

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:37.060
culture, and these guys don't even know what
that language is.

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:39.810
They are free from it.
The Tarahumara don't even have money.

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:44.250
They don't have a currency.
They're form of economics is by trading favors

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:47.310
and beer.
So, you know, not capitalism, not socialism.

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:55.780
It's kind of niceness and beerism.
So what Dr. Vigil was seeing there was -- either

00:10:55.780 --> 00:11:01.170
it's a coincidence, or it's cause and effect.
And he's a guy who's made his bones by finding

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:03.860
cause and effect where everybody else sees
coincidence.

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:08.140
You know, when you look at lean, Kenyan marathoners,
we like to just say, "Ah well, it's just coincidence.

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:14.490
They got that magic gene, that special chromosome.”
And we try to find apologies for ourselves

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:18.860
why -- any time someone does something better
than we do, why, "Well, that's just the way

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:19.890
it goes.
There's nothing we can do.”

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:24.860
When Vigil looks at the Tarahumara, he's not
trying to find excuses.

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:29.110
He's trying to find cause and effect.
He's trying to find the causal logical sequence

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:32.480
that he can then reproduce.
He looks at the Tarahumara, and he goes, "You

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:38.040
know, you don't have two extraordinary outliers
in the same tribe, and find no connection.”

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:43.040
You know, the guys who run the most and the
best are not coincidentally also the most

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:47.550
serene and healthiest on planet Earth.
What he wanted to do was find that connection

00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:50.970
to see if there were transferable skills he
could bring back to the modern world.

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:58.160
Unfortunately, he subsequently had triple
bypass and turned seventy and was tapped to

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:01.360
coach the U.S.
Olympic long-distance runners.

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:05.529
So, he never got a chance to make that trip.
By the way, if you want to know about his

00:12:05.529 --> 00:12:10.589
success, the only two medals in the Olympic
Marathon we've had in thirty years were directly

00:12:10.589 --> 00:12:15.940
coached by Dr. Joe Vigil.
He never got a chance to make that trip.

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:22.540
And, for better or worse, I did.
I was in Mexico on another magazine assignment,

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:25.660
and knew nothing about the Tarahumara, knew
nothing about distance running, really, because

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:33.560
I had given it up years earlier after suffering
the latest in a long series of extremely painful,

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:37.089
running ailments, as most people do.
You know, the running injury rate is something

00:12:37.089 --> 00:12:41.759
like sixty to eighty percent every year.
And it has not changed in 30 years.

00:12:41.759 --> 00:12:46.920
I mean, it's like an absolute epidemic.
It is like the swine flu of exercise afflictions,

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:51.579
and it never gets any better for 30 years.
So again, I was the same as everyone else.

00:12:51.579 --> 00:12:54.190
I got hurt.
I get hurt a lot, and I said, "To hell with

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:56.720
it; who needs it?"
If you want to prevent someone from doing

00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:00.649
anything, threaten them with pain.
So I give up running.

00:13:00.649 --> 00:13:06.790
There I am in Chihuahua -- and it's sort of
testament to the impact of what was going

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:10.430
to happen next -- that it totally drove my
assignment out of my mind.

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:16.110
And my assignment was to find this voluptuous,
Mexican pop star, who was secretly running

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:21.519
her own brainwashing teenage sex cult.
And within a second -- that's what I was looking

00:13:21.519 --> 00:13:25.760
for -- and then, I opened this magazine, and
I see this picture of this old guy in what

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:28.810
looked like a bathrobe and sandals just tearing
down this rocky trail.

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:35.430
And it turns out this guy was 55 years old.
And he had won a one-hundred mile race through

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:40.230
the Rocky Mountains at age 55 in thin, homemade
sandals.

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:43.970
And I remember looking at this picture, and
feeling all my sort of half-Sicilian blood

00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:47.160
starting to boil like, "What is this dude
doing that I'm not doing?

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:52.750
How is this guy getting away with hundred-mile
races in sandals at age 55, and I'm told if

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:57.449
I do 26 miles -- a quarter of that distance
 -- in high-tech running shoes, that's the

00:13:57.449 --> 00:14:01.060
ultimate challenge; I'm going to break down."
Again, so there's only one of two explanations.

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:04.940
Either it's some kind of weird chromosomal
thing, or it's strictly technical.

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:10.170
He's doing something that we're not.
So I ended up having the opportunity to make

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:14.879
the trip that Dr. Joe Vigil never was able
to make.

00:14:14.879 --> 00:14:19.139
And I got to report that it was an absolute
failure.

00:14:19.139 --> 00:14:24.260
I got down to the bottom of the canyons and
sort of finagled my way through drug cartels

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:30.110
and, against all odds, I actually located
this hidden, sort of subterranean home of

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:35.430
the guy named Arnulfo Quimare.
He was one of the best of the living Tarahumara

00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:39.240
runners.
I finally got there in the presence of the

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:44.920
master, the keys to the kingdom at my feet.
And we sat down, knee to knee, and I looked

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:49.610
into his eyes, and began to ask him questions.
And then, for the next four hours, he said

00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:52.230
nothing.
Just looked at me.

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:53.230
It's like dating back in college.

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:54.230
&gt;&gt; [laughter]

00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:58.839
&gt;&gt; He just looked at me and sort of like looked
off, as if he thought he heard something but

00:14:58.839 --> 00:15:03.660
he kind of hoped he hadn't.
And that went on and on through the afternoon.

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:09.370
It was just excruciatingly humiliating.
I mean, five minutes of silence is painful.

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:14.180
Four hours was abominable.
At the end of that time, the guy who was guiding

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:19.410
me just sort of put an end to my misery, and
says, "Let's get out of here.”

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:20.410
Get out of here -- where?
You know?

00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:23.699
We're at the bottom of canyons.
There's nothing for miles in every direction.

00:15:23.699 --> 00:15:30.660
He took me downstream to a little Tarahumara
schoolhouse where the kids would come down

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:35.019
from their cave homes at the beginning of
the week and basically camp out and live there

00:15:35.019 --> 00:15:38.959
all week long, and then, at the end of the
week, go back up to their hidden homes again.

00:15:38.959 --> 00:15:43.820
We go down to the schoolhouse, and the schoolmaster
 -- who had spent time in Chihuahua there

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:48.240
 -- was a little bit more acculturated than
Arnulfo, or at least a little bit less discriminating.

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:54.259
He gave us a place to stay for the night.
And he sympathized with me and said, "Look,

00:15:54.259 --> 00:15:56.750
of course these guys aren't going to talk
to you.

00:15:56.750 --> 00:16:01.480
The way you remain a reclusive tribe is by
not answering questions when people show up,

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:04.670
you know, poking their nose in your business.
They're not going to trust you at all.

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:08.529
You'd have to be down here a long time before
they will talk to you.

00:16:08.529 --> 00:16:14.009
You have to be down here at least as long
as the White Horse.”

00:16:14.009 --> 00:16:16.449
What White Horse?
And he starts to tell me this story about

00:16:16.449 --> 00:16:20.490
some guy they called the White Horse who appeared
one day, came running down out of the canyons.

00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:25.410
And every once in awhile, he would come drifting
in, have a cup of water, and go drifting back

00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:28.920
out again.
He was some kind of strange gringo like you.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:32.870
That's pretty much all he knew.
But he said, "If anybody is going to tell

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:35.940
you what's going on, it's this dude.
Because he's the only guy who's been down

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:40.850
here long enough to be trusted, and is the
only guy who's actually started to absorb

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:46.220
the very secrets that you're looking for."
It was fantastic, except it only dawned on

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:50.240
me the next day as we're halfway out of the
canyons that I'd just been totally blindsided

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:53.550
and snowed.
Of course, there was no White Horse, you know?

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:56.589
What a great feints.
What a great way to get me off the trail,

00:16:56.589 --> 00:17:01.500
to go looking for this mythical guy.
I guess I had to applaud them on their ingenuity.

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:07.220
It was a great disguise for masking their
community with lies.

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:12.440
But, as it turned out, I was wrong.
There actually is a White Horse, and I did

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:17.980
manage to locate him.
And he was way beyond my expectations, because

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:24.900
 -- just coincidentally -- this guy Caballa
Blanca, White Horse, was in exactly the same

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:28.710
position I was in when he first came down
to the canyons.

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:31.590
He's my exact height.
He's my exact shoe size.

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:35.020
He was almost the exact same age I was when
I was down there.

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:39.380
And, he also had busted-up ankles, and was
pretty discouraged with running.

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:43.500
He came down to study the Tarahumara, and
run with them.

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:47.670
And, by this point in his 50's, he was a totally
transformed guy.

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:52.600
He took me for a run up on the trails, and
it was unlike any kind of running I'd ever

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:56.110
seen before.
I remember it was like watching smoke go up

00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:59.020
out of a chimney.
We'd go up this steep hill; within minutes,

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:02.750
I am dying and gasping for breath and my body's
on fire.

00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:05.350
And, this guy, it's like running uphill for
him was like running downhill.

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:07.640
He just walked it on up.
It was like nothing.

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:12.510
And I remember looking to him and thinking
I'd only seen running like that once before

00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:16.050
in my life, and it was the day before when
I was at the Tarahumara schoolhouse and watched

00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:18.150
these kids.
This guy had done it.

00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:21.340
You know, he had found out how to move the
way they moved.

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:25.270
And it was unlike anything I'd ever seen.
You guys ever go to a marathon? Stand at the

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:29.210
finish line and watch people coming in? 30,000
people -- 30,000 different running styles

00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:33.880
 -- and the only thing they have in common
is they all look seriously unhappy, you know?

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:34.880
&gt;&gt; [Laughter].

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:38.020
&gt;&gt; People sort of clumping around.
And I'm watching these guys, and it looks

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:41.780
weightless.
It looks like it should produce the exact

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:45.570
same expression on the face that Joe Vigil
had seen.

00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:48.720
Have you ever seen a four-year-old or five-year-old
running around?

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:52.630
If you ever watch what they do, they like
to sort of lean forward first, and then fall

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:55.380
and go.
It's a feeling of weightlessness, like their

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:57.450
legs are just trying to keep up with their
body.

00:18:57.450 --> 00:19:01.290
And when you think about that feeling of weightlessness,
that's what everybody enjoys.

00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:06.790
That's why the entire amusement park industry
exists; it is to deal in weightlessness.

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:09.470
You know, roller coasters and twisters, all
that kind of stuff.

00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:14.970
It's this feeling of flying through the air.
Every activity the kid does has some form

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:18.710
of weightlessness, jumping rope or trampolines
or going on the swing set or being on the

00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:21.000
sliding board.
It's about feeling weightless.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.190
You know, we love that feeling.
It's as close as we get to flying on solid

00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:28.290
ground.
Somehow, these people had preserved a way

00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:32.990
of running, which is based on the principles
of weightlessness.

00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:36.330
Caballo had learned it.
I wanted to learn it too.

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:40.400
And I had a greater incentive too.
Because Caballo had this plan, this thing

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:44.960
he wanted to do.
He wanted to put on a race between the Tarahumara

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:55.880
and kind of a karmically-screened elite group
of outside ultra runners, which sounded pretty

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:58.960
dubious the first time he brought it up.
And the more he talked, the more ridiculous

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:01.570
it sounded.
Because, not only did he want to have this

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:05.080
race, but he wanted to have it in this most
inaccessible part of the canyons.

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:07.990
And then also, he'd be pretty discriminating
about who he would let show up too.

00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:11.640
It couldn't be the wrong kind of person.
It had to be not only a good runner, but a

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:15.240
good person.
And it was this ridiculous sort of thicket

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:20.540
of qualifications, which I couldn't see anybody
who could qualify would bother showing up

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:24.050
for this thing.
But I was still intrigued.

00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:31.770
I was intrigued because I wanted to find out
whether Vigil's theory was true.

00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:35.220
Are there transferable skills that we can
take from the Tarahumara, and incorporate

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:37.720
into our own lives?
Because, you know, it's nice to say, "Hey.

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:43.581
They're great. They're wonderful.”
But, it's pointless if we don't all go down

00:20:43.581 --> 00:20:47.750
to the canyons and eat mice and run through
the hills.

00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:49.570
I was intrigued for one other reason as well,
too.

00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:53.560
When I got out of the canyons after that visit
with Caballo and the Tarahumara, I started

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:58.850
to look into long distance running.
And I discovered that there have been certain

00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:00.840
mysteries of human history that, to this day,
have never been answered.

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:03.950
If you guys have the answers, then you know
more than anybody else on planet Earth, because

00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:07.220
no other humans ever answered these three
mysteries, okay?

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:15.360
One of the them is this: You women?
I mean this respectfully, but as sprinters,

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:17.360
every one -- every woman in this room -- you
suck.

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.540
You're terrible.
Women are awful sprinters.

00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:23.750
There is not a woman on planet Earth that
could out-sprint a pretty good, high school,

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:28.900
boy sprinter.
As milers, you are just about as bad.

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:34.830
The fastest mile ever run by a woman is routinely
snapped by high school state champions nationwide

00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:37.900
every year.
4:15 is the fastest mile that any woman has

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:41.680
ever run.
Now, as marathoners, it's kind of interesting.

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:45.760
Because you get to the marathon, which is
26 miles, and you guys are only ten minutes

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:48.400
off the male world record.
And you've only been doing marathons for about

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:51.530
20 years.
You guys got all your uteruses in shape now

00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:55.070
because, you know, 20 years ago, doctors were
telling you if you ran a marathon, your uterus

00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:56.070
would fall out, so.

00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:57.070
&gt;&gt; [Laughter]

00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:59.180
&gt;&gt; So I'm happy to see that somehow you have
fixed your uteruses.

00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:03.940
So define the best, medical opinion.
I was in college back then.

00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:10.030
It wasn't that long ago.
It's unbelievable that international, expert

00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:15.160
medical opinion said if you ran 26 miles you
would drop your uterus.

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:16.160
&gt;&gt; [Laughter].

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:23.180
&gt;&gt; I've watched a lot of marathons.
I have yet to see a discarded uterus anywhere.

00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:28.780
So that was only 20 years ago when you guys
were jerry rigging your uteruses and starting

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:31.880
the marathon, okay?
Now, you get into the longer distances.

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:36.030
You get to 50 to 100 miles, and suddenly,
it's anybody's game.

00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:39.860
You put Nikki Kimball into a hundred mile
race against any guy in the world, and it

00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:43.050
is a coin toss who's crossing that finish
line first.

00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:47.340
You go back to -- what was it?
2003? or -- 2002 with Cam Reid.

00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:51.180
She's like a milli-soccer mom from Texas or,
 -- sorry -- Arizona.

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:58.210
She's shows up at the Bad Water Ultra Marathon,
which is one of the toughest endurance contests.

00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:10.470
[pause] The "Arm of Nike." [pause]

00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:18.320
&gt;&gt; [sound tech support]

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:26.160
&gt;&gt; Good?
Okay. Sure.

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:39.110
It was back in 2003, I think, when Pam Reed
 -- who's a middle-aged soccer mom from Tucson

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:45.620
 -- shows up at Bad Water, 135-miles across
Death Valley, and up the side of Mt. Whitney

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:48.990
in July, the hottest time of the year and
the hottest place in the world.

00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:52.440
And Pam Reed schlacks the field, beats every
man and woman there.

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:56.490
What's more intriguing is -- if you actually
watch who came in next -- it was Pam, and

00:23:56.490 --> 00:24:00.130
then a guy, and then a woman, then a woman,
then a guy, then a woman, then a woman, then

00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:04.520
a guy.
Seven out of the top ten finishers were women.

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:08.130
Then Pam comes back the next year when the
crosshairs are on her back -- everyone's out

00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:15.540
to get her -- She wins it again.
In 2006, a woman named Emily Baer turns up

00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:20.170
at the Hardrock, which is one of the toughest
one-hundred mile courses you'll ever find,

00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:23.280
finishes in the top ten, and she might have
done a little bit better if she hadn't stopped

00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:26.330
to breast-feed her baby at the aid stations,
okay?

00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:27.340
&gt;&gt; [Laughter].

00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:33.660
&gt;&gt; She beat hundreds of men of elite, tough,
well-conditioned, ultra marathoners, while

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:37.210
stopping at the aid station to breast-feed
her child, and finished in the top ten.

00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:40.840
Okay. So, how's this possible?
How is it that, as distances get longer, women

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:44.000
get stronger?
Should not be physiologically possible, yet

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.160
it's scientific fact.
Okay, another scientific fact too.

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:51.360
Two million years ago human brain, you know,
australopithecus had a brain, you know, the

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:55.470
size of a cashew, and all of a sudden, homo
erectus shows up, and we go from this little

00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:58.620
peanut brain to this giant melon head, big
old brain.

00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:00.820
Two million years ago.
Scientific facts.

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:06.600
You can only calorically support a brain of
that size if you have access to some form

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:09.550
of concentrated protein essentially.
There was no tofu.

00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:13.460
It had to be dead animals.
So two million years ago, no doubt about it,

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:17.570
homo erectus is eating dead animals.
The only problem is, the first weapon only

00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:22.230
appeared two hundred thousand years ago.
So somehow, for nearly two million years,

00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:28.280
we are getting nice, fresh, animal carcasses,
with absolutely no weapons to get them with.

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:31.750
And, if you wanted to look around you and
think, Is there on you at this moment that

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:36.340
can kill a kudu -- no, we have no claws, we
have no fangs, we have no strength, we have

00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:40.511
no speed.
We have -- we are the biggest wussies that

00:25:40.511 --> 00:25:44.130
have ever walked planet Earth.
I mean -- and if you think it was speed -- you

00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:47.600
know, Usain Bolt is the fastest guy who's
ever lived, but he sucks.

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:50.350
I mean, compared to a squirrel, he's slow.

00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:54.740
&gt;&gt; [Laughter].

00:25:54.740 --> 00:26:01.350
&gt;&gt; So, how on earth -- for two million years
 -- are we getting animals without any means

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:03.650
to kill them?
Never been solved, okay?

00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:07.850
&gt;&gt; Last mystery, again, never been solved.
If you track the finishing times of people

00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:11.740
who run marathons, usually you are only allowed
to start running marathons when you're around

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:14.410
age 19.
That's the youngest you can be.

00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:18.711
Start running marathon age 19.
Statistically you will get faster and faster

00:26:18.711 --> 00:26:23.190
for the next eight years until you hit your
peak -- you'll top out at age 27.

00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:27.670
After age 27, it's that sort of slow decline.
You get slower and slower until you're back

00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:33.491
to running the same pace you were at age 19.
So 19, get to your peak, slower and slower

00:26:33.491 --> 00:26:36.330
and slower, back to age 19 again.
Some of you've read the books, you may know

00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:41.110
this answer, but anyone just sort of toss
how long it takes you to lose your top end

00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:43.720
speed after you beat?
Eight years up and how many years down?

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:48.400
Want to throw it out? Someone knows the answer,
I'm sure.

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:55.910
What's that? Age 64.
It takes you 45 years to lose your top-end

00:26:55.910 --> 00:26:57.320
speed.
That's preposterous.

00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:00.500
There's no other physical activity on planet
Earth.

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:04.590
I mean, I'll go beyond sports.
I'll go into like sex and eating and chess,

00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:07.490
you know?
There's no 65-year-old on the planet that

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:12.760
is competing with his teenage self and winning
 -- except in one sport -- and that is long

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:15.650
distance running.
So how were these mysteries -- how could they

00:27:15.650 --> 00:27:18.940
possibly be resolved?
Well, they might be resolved in the same way

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:25.620
that we can resolve the mystery of those goofy
smiles at mile sixty in the Leadville 1994.

00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:35.500
What if humans evolved as hunting pack animals?
What if the way we survived two million years

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:42.110
ago was by using these unique characteristics
possessed only by us -- only by humans -- to

00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:45.190
run animals to death?
To run them, run them, run them till they

00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:49.340
[snap] drop over dead? Okay, it sounds preposterous.
But the you start to think about it a little

00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:51.080
bit.
If you took this human leg, cut it off at

00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:55.540
the hip, threw it up on the table, dissected
it, and yanked out all the stuff inside, and

00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:57.401
you brought an engineer in here to look at
it.

00:27:57.401 --> 00:27:59.850
And you would say, "Now, what would you do
with all these parts?" He would say, "Well,

00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:01.960
obviously, I would build some kind of a pogo
stick.

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:07.270
Come kind of a bouncing machine, because obviously
this is a propulsive device for bouncing.”

00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:12.240
The human leg is like a golf ball.
It is so packed with elastic recoil tendons,

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:16.330
that you can almost like bounce it like a
perpetual-motion machine; it will let it go

00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:18.510
and go and go.
And if you want evidence of that, just look

00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:20.900
at fighters.
If you ever want to check whether humans were

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:24.280
evolved for an activity, see whether or not
boxers do it.

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:28.400
Because boxers have zero margin for error.
A boxer is not going to fart around with anything

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:31.180
that's not going to keep him alive, or he'll
get his face punched off.

00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:35.016
And if you ever watch a boxer in a ring, they're
not running the way people do in a marathon.

00:28:35.016 --> 00:28:37.280
What are they doing?
They're bouncing on the balls of their feet.

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:41.010
And you bounce on the balls -- I would demonstrate
it right now, but I would look stupid, so

00:28:41.010 --> 00:28:46.470
 -- when you bounce on the balls of your feet,
suddenly, you'll click into a rhythm where

00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:49.860
you no longer know you're bouncing.
You're not even using energy anymore.

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:54.080
You're just going and going and going.
So, we have legs -- they have dissected plenty

00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:57.890
of other mammals.
They have found one other mammal that almost

00:28:57.890 --> 00:29:02.250
has as many elastic recoils in the leg as
we do, and that animal is called a kangaroo.

00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:07.000
We beat out the kangaroo for elastic recoil
in our legs.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.791
Second thing we have, which is unique to humans
is -- the reason why I tend to, you know,

00:29:11.791 --> 00:29:17.150
smell around here -- is because we perspire.
Most animals perspire, but that is our primary

00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:20.520
way of venting heat.
We sweat, they breathe.

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:26.200
Which means, if you ever go up against a horse
in a 20-mile race, you will win, because after

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:28.920
a certain number of miles -- by ten miles
or so -- that horse has a choice.

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:33.140
It's either going to breathe, or it's going
to cool off, but it ain't doing both.

00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:35.340
We can.
And if you want evidence of that, go back

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:39.810
to Bad Water.
What other animal would voluntarily pay $800

00:29:39.810 --> 00:29:45.920
to go to Death Valley in July, you know, to
spend sixty hours running down the highway?

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:50.980
I mean, if you look down from a satellite
on November first at the aisle of Manhattan,

00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:55.050
and you suddenly saw tens of thousands of
organisms running through the streets, you

00:29:55.050 --> 00:30:00.610
would assume that it's either some kind of
a panic or some kind of weird mammalian instinct

00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:03.390
to run in a herd.
That's what humans do.

00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:05.381
You know, it's bizarre when you think about
it.

00:30:05.381 --> 00:30:09.470
What other animal -- other than like, you
know, again, panicky wildebeests -- ever get

00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:14.720
together by the tens of thousands to run for
three hours through the streets?

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:18.030
There is something in us that wants us to
gather and run together.

00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:21.610
So that model works.
If humans are hunting pack animals, and the

00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:29.330
only way of acquiring the cranial capacity
and the survival demands was to run animals

00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:35.600
to death, well, that cause has certain consequences.
You can't be a hunting pack animal if you

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:38.190
are a greedy bastard.
You know, you can't haul a bunch of your crap

00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:40.140
around while you're trying to keep up with
the pack.

00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:45.510
You've got to be basically free and unencumbered.
You have got to be pretty egalitarian, you

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:48.960
know? You can't be the tough guy who's blazing
out for individual glory.

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:52.740
You've got to be part of the pack.
You've got to be able to be a woman and keep

00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:59.420
up with that pack, because no time in your
life are you more in need of animal protein

00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:03.150
than when you are a nursing mother or a developing
adolescent.

00:31:03.150 --> 00:31:07.290
So, if you're a kid or a woman, you have got
to keep up with that pack.

00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:11.620
If you're an old guy, the pack can't do without
you, because the hardest thing about catching

00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:14.100
a kudu is figuring out which friggin' kudu
you're trying to catch.

00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:17.711
Because these guys will explode -- the herd
will explode -- and go off in every direction,

00:31:17.711 --> 00:31:20.970
and then reform again.
And you got to keep chasing the same one,

00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:25.200
because you can't keep chasing fresh legs.
It's a very hard skill to acquire.

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:29.900
It takes more than a lifetime, and the only
way that is developed is by these guys who

00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:33.220
are in their 50's and sixties.
One more thing that's kind of interesting

00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:35.900
too.
There's a guy named Louis Liebenberg who has

00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:40.070
studied the Kalihari bushmen, who -- to this
day -- still do what's called "persistence

00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:43.340
hunts.”
He's been on about a dozen of these persistence

00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:48.820
hunts, and he's found on average it takes
between two to five hours to run an antelope

00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:52.170
to death.
Which, surprisingly, corresponds exactly to

00:31:52.170 --> 00:31:56.360
the finishing times for most marathons.
Two to five hours.

00:31:56.360 --> 00:32:03.200
So then, suddenly we start to have this model
forming, this idea that maybe everything we

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:07.401
think is awesome about us -- you know, basically,
everything you guys do for a living that is

00:32:07.401 --> 00:32:12.890
sort of the height of human creativity and
achievement -- Maybe it all sprang from one

00:32:12.890 --> 00:32:17.010
thing: our ability to run.
Because without running, we don't get that

00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:21.190
burst of animal protein two million years
ago which allowed our brains so it could be

00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:24.540
fueled to grow in size.
We never developed the communication skills

00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:27.650
to be able to pass this knowledge on from
person to person.

00:32:27.650 --> 00:32:33.940
We never developed that ability to think outside,
to think beyond the visible to the creative,

00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:37.460
the imaginary.
The thing about tracking is, there's comes

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:41.170
a moment when you've got to stop thinking
about what you see, and think about what's

00:32:41.170 --> 00:32:44.470
ahead -- not what you're seeing in front of
you or what that animal has already done.

00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:48.630
You have to anticipate.
Anticipation is the basis of imagination -- the

00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:52.000
basis of creativity.
That's something we have in spades and few

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.590
other animals have.
We can think ahead, and they can not -- as

00:32:55.590 --> 00:33:00.020
far as I know.
But, it also gives us a certain cargoload

00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:07.320
of responsibilities to be in sync with what
we have developed to do.

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:13.180
It's counterproductive if we first become
immobile and greedy and possessive and domineering.

00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:17.610
That's sort of not what we are.
And the proof of that might just be down in

00:33:17.610 --> 00:33:22.010
those canyons among the Tarahumara.
Because, you know, you take an animal out

00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:25.010
of the wilderness and you stick it into a
zoo -- what happens to it?

00:33:25.010 --> 00:33:29.909
Okay. It becomes antisocial and grumpy and
fat and sexually dysfunctional, essentially

00:33:29.909 --> 00:33:32.980
 -- most like you guys.

00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:34.080
&gt;&gt; [Laughter].

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:36.670
&gt;&gt; You know, you look at the animal in the
wild and suddenly, it's not overeating.

00:33:36.670 --> 00:33:40.600
It's not, you know, mauling its young.
It's not sort of refusing to mate unless it

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:44.530
has the Great like, Lotus Leaf.
It's just having a good time, you know, and

00:33:44.530 --> 00:33:48.120
doing its thing.
This brought us sort of full circle, and I

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:55.190
felt like I was on the verge of getting my
hands on a lot of really cool wisdom that's

00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:59.320
all been out there, but essentially hadn't
all been sort of tongue-in-groove and locked

00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:04.490
together yet.
And I think Caballo's aspiration was that

00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:08.339
the moment to do this would be at his race.
What if he could bring down some ultra runners,

00:34:08.339 --> 00:34:13.000
people who specialize in hundred-mile races?
Bring them down to the canyons, and introduce

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:18.279
them to their prehistoric counterparts.
And see whether there isn't not some sort

00:34:18.279 --> 00:34:20.889
of common ground there.
Whether these ultra runners are not trying

00:34:20.889 --> 00:34:25.309
to rediscover what the Tarahumara have never
forgotten.

00:34:25.309 --> 00:34:28.869
And then bring back those transferable skills
to the rest of us.

00:34:28.869 --> 00:34:32.250
Because one thing that's unusual about ultra
runners is, you see one thing on their face

00:34:32.250 --> 00:34:36.629
that you don't see on marathoners, which is
a smile, you know? Ultra runners bizarrely

00:34:36.629 --> 00:34:41.619
seem to have much more fun than people who
are running a quarter of the same distance.

00:34:41.619 --> 00:34:45.419
The only problem with Caballo is, racewise,
there basically was not a chance in hell he's

00:34:45.419 --> 00:34:48.980
going to have any racers.
I wrote an article for Runner’s World.

00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:53.299
People knew about it, and the response was
a resounding like, silence.

00:34:53.299 --> 00:35:00.400
I heard nothing from anybody for months -- until
just a few weeks before this race was going

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:03.420
to take place.
I started getting a couple of messages.

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:07.269
I got a message from a guy named Scott Jurek,
who, you know, I had to sort of double check

00:35:07.269 --> 00:35:11.000
and e-mail back and make sure wasn't a gag.
Because it's -- let's say you're going to

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:16.410
put on your Pro M Golf Tournament at your
country club, and you get a call from a guy

00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:19.980
named Tiger who wants to know if there's any
chance he could fill out a foursome.

00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:27.060
Scott Jurek is a guy who -- seven-time winner
of the Western States 100, the premier 100-mile

00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:29.829
event.
One year, he went right from Western States

00:35:29.829 --> 00:35:32.930
up in the mountains, then down to Death Valley,
and -- not only won that race -- but set the

00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:36.200
course record.
You know, two weeks after winning a one-hundred

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:40.400
mile race, he then birthed the record for
the 135-mile race.

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:43.480
Scott Jurek sent me a message saying, you
know, he's interested and wants to show up.

00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:48.691
So, I got one guy in the bag.
And then, I made a phone call to a woman named

00:35:48.691 --> 00:35:53.270
Jenn Shelton -- and, if you are not familiar
with Jenn Shelton, it means you've never worked

00:35:53.270 --> 00:36:00.920
for the Virginia Beach Police Department.
Jenn Shelton was a surfer and a rugby player

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:05.579
and a skateboarder before she got involved
in ultra marathons.

00:36:05.579 --> 00:36:10.250
The first race she ever ran as a runner wasn't
a 10K or a 5K; it was a fifty-mile race to

00:36:10.250 --> 00:36:13.599
the Blue Ridge Mountains, in which she set
the age-course record.

00:36:13.599 --> 00:36:17.869
Her next race was a hundred-mile race where
she did a hand-stand, shadow-boxed at the

00:36:17.869 --> 00:36:23.319
50-mile mark, ate pizza and Mountain Dew,
and broke the course record by three hours.

00:36:23.319 --> 00:36:29.140
So, a few weeks before I was going to leave
for this race in which I thought I would pretty

00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:32.730
much be the only runner and maybe just a Lance
Armstrong kind of dude.

00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:36.839
I made a call to Jenn Shelton to do an article
for Runner’s World about why it is that

00:36:36.839 --> 00:36:41.960
so many of these young 20-year-olds were getting
involved in races that involved spending all

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:47.730
Saturday night running through the woods.
Here's what I said to her.

00:36:47.730 --> 00:36:51.760
It was her answer that made me think that,
you know, maybe we're a lot closer to these

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:56.579
___________ truths than we realize.
Maybe there is a right way to run.

00:36:56.579 --> 00:37:01.609
Maybe there are transferable skills where
people can run and enjoy and not get hurt

00:37:01.609 --> 00:37:04.880
in the eighty percent casualty rate we have
now.

00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:12.079
Or not depend on these big bone, art-supported,
bullshit monstrosities that you pay $150 for,

00:37:12.079 --> 00:37:15.819
and are told you have to get rid of in three
months and get another pair.

00:37:15.819 --> 00:37:19.500
Maybe there's a way where 26 miles is not
such a big deal after all.

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:25.490
Maybe 50 or 100 is perfectly achievable.
And by the time I was done talking to her,

00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:30.069
I realized that -- well, this -- I'm trying
to choose my adjectives carefully.

00:37:30.069 --> 00:37:35.799
If this multipally-arrested, 21-year-old,
college-dropout surfer could do it, maybe

00:37:35.799 --> 00:37:38.920
the rest of us could as well.
So, my first question to her was this, "So

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:42.359
why don't you run marathons?
Don't you think you could qualify for the

00:37:42.359 --> 00:37:48.140
Olympic Trials?" And Jenn said, "Dude -- seriously.
The qualifying standard is 2:48.

00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:49.359
Anybody can do that."

00:37:49.359 --> 00:37:50.359
&gt;&gt; [Laughter]

00:37:50.359 --> 00:37:55.180
&gt;&gt; Jenn could run a sub-3-hour marathon while
wearing a string bikini and chugging a beer

00:37:55.180 --> 00:38:00.290
at mile 23 -- and she would, just five days
after running a 50-mile trail race in the

00:38:00.290 --> 00:38:02.599
Blue Ridge Mountains.
Yeah, but then what?

00:38:02.599 --> 00:38:06.750
I hate all this hype about the marathon.
Where's the mystery?

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:10.990
I knew this girl who's training for the trials,
and she's got every single workout planned

00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:14.160
for like, the next 3 years.
I couldn't take it, man.

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:18.299
I was supposed to run with her once at six
in the morning, and I called her up at 2 a.m.

00:38:18.299 --> 00:38:23.469
to tell her I was shit-faced on margaritas
and probably not going to make it.

00:38:23.469 --> 00:38:24.469
&gt;&gt; [Laughter]

00:38:24.469 --> 00:38:26.720
&gt;&gt; Jenn didn't have a coach or a training
program.

00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:30.230
She didn't even own a watch.
She just rolled out of bed every morning,

00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:35.519
downed the veggie burger, and ran as far and
as fast as she felt like -- which usually

00:38:35.519 --> 00:38:40.549
turned out to be about 20 miles.
"You know, I never really discussed this with

00:38:40.549 --> 00:38:44.500
anyone, because it sounds kind of pretentious,
but I started running ultras to become a better

00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:45.809
person.”
Jenn told me.

00:38:45.809 --> 00:38:51.319
I thought, "Man, if you can run a hundred
miles, you'd be in this zen state.

00:38:51.319 --> 00:38:56.519
You'd be the fucking Buddha.
[laughter] Bringing peace and a smile to the

00:38:56.519 --> 00:38:57.519
world."

00:38:57.519 --> 00:39:01.670
&gt;&gt; In my case, it didn't work.
I'm the same old punk ass as ever.

00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:05.020
But there's always this hope that it'll turn
you into the person you want to be -- you

00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:09.640
know, like a better and more peaceful person.
When I'm at a long run, the only thing in

00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:15.359
life that matters is finishing the run.
For once, my brain isn't going "Bleh, Bleh,

00:39:15.359 --> 00:39:18.660
Bleh, Bleh.”
Thinking just quiets down, and the only thing

00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:25.059
going on is pure flow.
It's just me and the movement and the motion.

00:39:25.059 --> 00:39:27.109
That's what I love.
Just being a barbarian, running wild through

00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:30.420
the woods.
You know, I thought to myself, "Listening

00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:33.970
to Jenn was like communing with the ghost
of Caballa Blanco.”

00:39:33.970 --> 00:39:37.660
So, I said to her, "You know, it's weird how
much you sound like this guy I met in Mexico.

00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:41.550
I'm actually heading down there in a few weeks
for a race he's putting on with the Tarahumara

00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:43.270
Indians.”
"No way!"

00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:48.410
"I think Scott Jurek is going to be there.”
"You are shitting me!" the budding Buddha

00:39:48.410 --> 00:39:51.920
explained.
"Really? Hey, can me and my friend go? Oh

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:54.089
shit, no; hang on.
We got midterms that week.

00:39:54.089 --> 00:39:56.490
All right, I'm going to have to pull a fast
one.

00:39:56.490 --> 00:40:00.150
Give me till tomorrow.”
So next morning, as promised, I get this message

00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:03.390
from Jenn.
"My mom thinks you're a serial killer who's

00:40:03.390 --> 00:40:04.390
going to murder us in the desert."

00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:05.910
&gt;&gt; [Laughter].

00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:13.519
&gt;&gt; "It's totally worth the risk.
So where do we meet you guys?" And that was

00:40:13.519 --> 00:40:15.809
it.
We were literally off to the races.

00:40:15.809 --> 00:40:21.049
My friend Barefoot Ted showed up.
Jenn and Billy Bonehead and Scott Jurek and

00:40:21.049 --> 00:40:27.759
Luis Escobar and myself.
And not long after, we found ourselves totally

00:40:27.759 --> 00:40:33.230
mystified by the fact that the very guy -- who
would not even sneeze in my direction a year

00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:39.200
earlier, Arnulfo Quimare, came out with 20
other Tarahumara runners to turn out for what

00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:43.519
Caballo would later say was a "World class
event down here in the middle of nowhere.”

00:40:43.519 --> 00:40:48.410
And you know, it's something kind of sort
of unique happened after that event, which

00:40:48.410 --> 00:40:53.890
is, we felt this -- I don't know, man.
Would you call it a "bond of kinship," Ted?

00:40:53.890 --> 00:40:57.319
Something very galvanizing happened down there,
and I think it's because we all came away

00:40:57.319 --> 00:41:03.019
feeling that we had absorbed something.
And it's not that hard to learn.

00:41:03.019 --> 00:41:08.700
And I -- as much as I am reluctant to offer
some sort of panacea, some sort of cure all

00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:12.400
 -- I think that once the machine starts to
operate the way it was designed -- once you

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:16.359
get the car off the block, and start to run
that engine a little bit -- things fall into

00:41:16.359 --> 00:41:20.319
place.
I've never finished a run without realizing

00:41:20.319 --> 00:41:21.840
I've been very wrong about something, you
know?

00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:25.859
That something was my fault or I need to apologize
to somebody.

00:41:25.859 --> 00:41:30.640
It's something about those meditative moments
of running, I think, gets the machine operating

00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:34.690
the way it should be.
And, if I can accomplish one thing -- and

00:41:34.690 --> 00:41:37.950
I think Ted feels the same way -- is, if we
can end this war in running.

00:41:37.950 --> 00:41:43.089
All this baloney, hysteria, "Be careful, don't
hurt yourself.”

00:41:43.089 --> 00:41:45.230
"Don't do too much." "Don't take your shoes
off.”

00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:49.410
I mean, shoes have existed for that long [snap]
in human history, you know?

00:41:49.410 --> 00:41:54.309
Tens of billions of people have done just
fine without these things on their feet, and

00:41:54.309 --> 00:41:57.710
yet somehow we're told we've got to have them.
So, anyway, that's something that I think

00:41:57.710 --> 00:42:00.670
I came away from is, I was grateful for regaining
the use of my legs.

00:42:00.670 --> 00:42:05.770
I think it's changed me in profound ways.
And, you know, I think it's something that's

00:42:05.770 --> 00:42:07.970
available to everybody else as well.
So, thanks very much.

00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:14.809
I'll be happy to answer any questions you've
got.

00:42:14.809 --> 00:42:15.809
&gt;&gt; [Applause]

00:42:15.809 --> 00:42:19.410
&gt;&gt; Hi.
I have a couple of questions.

00:42:19.410 --> 00:42:24.720
I'll be quick.
So you're saying that the Tarahumara run basically

00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:31.079
barefoot, or in sandals?
Did you see any kind of bunions among them

00:42:31.079 --> 00:42:32.079
at all, like?

00:42:32.079 --> 00:42:41.579
&gt;&gt; Ted, show your foot please?
Would you care to remove your homemade footwear?

00:42:41.579 --> 00:42:51.070
Demonstrate your bunions and your calluses
 -- all those calluses you get when you run

00:42:51.070 --> 00:42:54.300
barefoot.
Yeah. No, I guess -- bunions are caused by

00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:57.369
shoes.
There was a podiatrist named Paul Brand, who

00:42:57.369 --> 00:43:01.160
spent a lot of time working with indigenous
people, and he said, "You know, it's funny.

00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:07.470
The only time I ever see bunions and hammertoes
and foot ailments and disfigurements is in

00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:11.819
the U.S. among people who wear shoes.”
When people go barefoot those things just

00:43:11.819 --> 00:43:12.819
don't exist.

00:43:12.819 --> 00:43:17.710
&gt;&gt; And my other question was, when you do
that much running, do you find you have to

00:43:17.710 --> 00:43:21.160
do other things like, make sure your abs are
strong, or stuff like that?

00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:25.599
Or is it pretty much just with the running?
In terms of like, injuries?

00:43:25.599 --> 00:43:31.880
&gt;&gt; You know, it's kind of curious is that,
I was really slow to figure out stuff that

00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:32.880
was very obvious.

00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:33.880
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:36.799
&gt;&gt; -- particularly stuff that was told actually
told to me clearly, and I would listen and

00:43:36.799 --> 00:43:39.259
not hear it.
But, I was told from the getgo from the barefoot

00:43:39.259 --> 00:43:40.829
guys -- the guys who have been doing this
a long time.

00:43:40.829 --> 00:43:45.869
There's like nothing that I come across that
wasn't articulated by barefoot runners 20

00:43:45.869 --> 00:43:48.029
years ago.
And you know what they say is, you can only

00:43:48.029 --> 00:43:50.480
do it properly if everything is in balance
and focused.

00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:54.730
What I find is, the better I'm running, the
more accurate my core is, the better my posture

00:43:54.730 --> 00:43:58.329
is, the more I'm using my arms.
So it is -- in a sense -- that full-body work

00:43:58.329 --> 00:43:59.449
out to do it properly.

00:43:59.449 --> 00:44:03.539
&gt;&gt; So you don't have to like, prepare for
it so much to have everything -- like in the

00:44:03.539 --> 00:44:05.200
gym -- to have everything equal strength?

00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:08.710
&gt;&gt; Have you ever seen a kid do hot yoga and
put on a B race, you know?

00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:09.710
&gt;&gt; [Laughter].

00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:12.630
&gt;&gt; What do kids do?
Kids just go -- I have a five-year-old daughter,

00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:17.869
and when she wants to run, she just goes,
"Go!" That's it.

00:44:17.869 --> 00:44:18.869
You go.

00:44:18.869 --> 00:44:19.869
&gt;&gt; Okay. Cool. Great talk.

00:44:19.869 --> 00:44:22.420
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
I mean, it is so much simpler.

00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:26.720
I mean, Ted does barefoot running clinics.
I'm sure he could teach you a dramatically

00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:33.430
different way to run in ten minutes, you know.
Any more questions?

00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:40.710
&gt;&gt; How do you see the multi-billion dollar
sports footwear industry responding to these

00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:41.710
insights?

00:44:41.710 --> 00:44:42.710
&gt;&gt; [laughter]

00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:49.200
&gt;&gt; Death! Death to the multibillion dollar.
It's the biggest, stinking scam -- other than

00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:53.089
opposing universal health care.
It's the biggest bunch of.

00:44:53.089 --> 00:44:54.999
&gt;&gt; [Clapping] [cheering] Weu!

00:44:54.999 --> 00:45:01.530
&gt;&gt; Or gay marriage -- one of those two.
You know, it's just -- it's a serious bunch

00:45:01.530 --> 00:45:04.259
of bullshit.
Those shoes serve no purpose.

00:45:04.259 --> 00:45:07.119
They cause the ailments that they're supposed
to be curing.

00:45:07.119 --> 00:45:12.660
There's absolutely no reason on earth that
you should have a big pad of foam under your

00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:15.839
heel.
Now, the only thing that pad does is encourage

00:45:15.839 --> 00:45:18.500
you to land on the one part of your foot you
should never land on.

00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:21.890
If I stand on this thing and jump off, the
last thing I want to hit on the ground is

00:45:21.890 --> 00:45:25.010
my heel.
I want to land on the balls of my feet and

00:45:25.010 --> 00:45:28.019
bend my knees.
You land on your heel, that motion is impossible.

00:45:28.019 --> 00:45:33.279
Running is a series of jumps, okay? Walking
is a shifting of body weight from side to

00:45:33.279 --> 00:45:35.349
side.
Running, by definition, you're up in the air

00:45:35.349 --> 00:45:39.190
and you're coming down.
When you land on your heel, that leg is in

00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:40.930
the most vulnerable position it can possibly
be in.

00:45:40.930 --> 00:45:45.210
The knee's hyper-extended.
The leg is a straight shock of impact going

00:45:45.210 --> 00:45:49.839
from joint to joint to joint, and you're balancing
your entire body weight in a braking motion.

00:45:49.839 --> 00:45:53.450
[Rrrp.] Like that.
Now, if you run on your bare feet, you can't

00:45:53.450 --> 00:45:54.560
do that.
You'll land on the ball of your foot, you'll

00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:59.700
compress that knee by necessity.
The one point that I want to make is, this

00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:04.369
is not really a battle between "shoes vs.
no shoes.”

00:46:04.369 --> 00:46:09.410
Shoes are better than bare feet.
Protection is always better than no protection.

00:46:09.410 --> 00:46:13.369
But, the question becomes, What is a shoe
actually doing to your foot?

00:46:13.369 --> 00:46:16.059
Does the shoe let your foot go where it wants
to go?

00:46:16.059 --> 00:46:20.220
As soon as the technology overwhelms the demand,
then you got a problem.

00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:23.600
Like, that's when the sibors become self-aware
and are destroying humanity, you know.

00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:24.600
&gt;&gt; [Laughter].

00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:27.150
&gt;&gt; I like these crazy like, beaver Fivefinger
shoes.

00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:32.170
Like, doesn't your CEO wear these guys too?
You guys want to go up through the ranks,

00:46:32.170 --> 00:46:37.359
I'll get some of these crazy monkey shoes,
if I were you.

00:46:37.359 --> 00:46:41.089
Ted makes these huarache’s.
A shoe that allows your foot to move the way

00:46:41.089 --> 00:46:43.170
it wants to move is, -- and you know who said
this too?

00:46:43.170 --> 00:46:47.660
It wasn't me; this was Bill Rogers.
Bill Rogers won what -- four Boston marathons,

00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:51.710
one of the best marathoners of all time.
He said the same thing.

00:46:51.710 --> 00:46:56.391
The shoe that allows your foot to move as
if it were barefoot, that's the shoe you want.

00:46:56.391 --> 00:46:58.299
More questions?

00:46:58.299 --> 00:47:01.170
&gt;&gt; Hi.
Great talk.

00:47:01.170 --> 00:47:06.420
Enjoyed it.
What is the life expectancy of the Tarahumara

00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:07.420
tribe?

00:47:07.420 --> 00:47:10.849
&gt;&gt; You know, it's actually pretty low.
It's like 45.

00:47:10.849 --> 00:47:16.869
They have an extraordinarily high infant mortality
rate -- as most cultures do that don't have

00:47:16.869 --> 00:47:21.380
access to pediatric care and to antibiotics.
You survive those first few months, though,

00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:25.950
and you're off the razor for a long time.
So, what they lose on the front end, they

00:47:25.950 --> 00:47:31.660
make up on the back end.
The Tarahumara tend to be extremely nimble

00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:33.109
and mobile.
Caballo talks about a 95-year-old Tarahumara

00:47:33.109 --> 00:47:39.039
guy that he saw cruising across a 30-mile
mountain range at age 95.

00:47:39.039 --> 00:47:45.040
&gt;&gt; You talked a little bit about how people
lose this love for running between five and

00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:47.991
25.
I think that kind of spoke to me.

00:47:47.991 --> 00:47:52.690
You know, you start in school, and running
becomes this kind of artificial thing, right?

00:47:52.690 --> 00:47:55.010
You're running in artificial tracks in loops
and loops.

00:47:55.010 --> 00:47:58.000
I used to run the two mile in high school,
and it was 20 laps.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:02.670
And you're doing that all the time, right?
So by -- the good thing is, it's only ten

00:48:02.670 --> 00:48:06.970
or eleven minutes.
The bad thing is, by lap like 18, you want

00:48:06.970 --> 00:48:09.384
to hang yourself.
You know, I started doing cross-country.

00:48:09.384 --> 00:48:13.210
Even though it's sort of regimented, you're
out in the woods, like you said.

00:48:13.210 --> 00:48:21.089
And I think, maybe that change needs to happen.
Instead of having everything so institutionalized

00:48:21.089 --> 00:48:26.869
in these, you know, hundred meters, two hundred
meters, mile, two mile, if it was a little

00:48:26.869 --> 00:48:31.900
bit more free form or you know, these longer
races, where it's more true to the spirit

00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:37.209
of running, that might put a lot of kids into
running instead of off of it.

00:48:37.209 --> 00:48:39.999
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you know, I totally agree with you.
I keep thinking -- I mean, I wish people would

00:48:39.999 --> 00:48:43.661
run two miles as if they were running a hundred
miles, because you can't run a hundred miles

00:48:43.661 --> 00:48:45.580
by yourself.
You need a support crew there to help you

00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:49.040
out, you need to have patience with you.
There's something much more real.

00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:51.289
And you can't just go jetting off as hard
as you can.

00:48:51.289 --> 00:48:54.359
You got to throttle back and be able to do
the long haul.

00:48:54.359 --> 00:48:57.359
And you see people now when they start to
run, and it's constantly like, "Deet. Deet.

00:48:57.359 --> 00:48:58.489
Deet." you know?
Checking their watch.

00:48:58.489 --> 00:49:00.549
And you know, people saying, "Have you run
a marathon yet?

00:49:00.549 --> 00:49:03.400
When are you going to run a marathon? How
fast do you do a marathon?" It's all this

00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:06.180
like, work stress in what's supposed to be
recreation.

00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:10.230
You know, we've done something with running
which -- we've taken what we're crappy at,

00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:12.799
which is speed, and make it the thing we try
to do all the time.

00:49:12.799 --> 00:49:15.079
Go faster and faster.
But we're not fast.

00:49:15.079 --> 00:49:17.040
We have endurance.
And you mentioned cross country.

00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:19.909
That is an endurance sport.
It's a communal pack sport.

00:49:19.909 --> 00:49:22.450
&gt;&gt; It's a team sport, yeah.

00:49:22.450 --> 00:49:24.099
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[pause]

00:49:24.099 --> 00:49:27.420
&gt;&gt; Hi.
My question is specific to the big runs.

00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:31.210
I've started running in those.
And I felt amazing for the first couple of

00:49:31.210 --> 00:49:33.270
miles, and then started to get blisters --

00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:34.500
&gt;&gt; Suck up to the boss, aren't you?

00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:37.530
&gt;&gt; -- and friction and stuff like that.
Just curious.

00:49:37.530 --> 00:49:41.220
I guess that's just something you have to
 -- your skin will toughen up over time, and

00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:44.450
it's something you get used to, or could be.

00:49:44.450 --> 00:49:48.900
&gt;&gt; Barefoot Ken Bob, who's kind of the guru
of the barefoot running movement said, "Barefoot

00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:51.980
running is not about being tough.
It's about being sensitive.”

00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:55.349
And his point is that, I've got no calluses
on my feet; neither does Ted.

00:49:55.349 --> 00:49:59.249
If you start to callus, it means you're doing
something wrong.

00:49:59.249 --> 00:50:02.980
If you feel like your feet need to toughen,
it's because you've got technical problems,

00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:08.049
not a skin problem.
The trick of barefoot running is basically

00:50:08.049 --> 00:50:11.440
slipping the foot straight up.
If you're pushing back, you're pulling like

00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:14.069
that [demonstrating], you're going to have
friction and you're going to callus.

00:50:14.069 --> 00:50:17.339
And I would suggest too, before you actually
start using the Five Fingers, I would do a

00:50:17.339 --> 00:50:22.609
lot of running in your own bare feet on asphalt.
Because, again, you'll learn pretty quick

00:50:22.609 --> 00:50:23.609
how to do it right.

00:50:23.609 --> 00:50:26.230
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
But the calves were just like on fire after

00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:27.230
that.

00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:28.829
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
I mean it's something -- if you did 50 push-ups

00:50:28.829 --> 00:50:32.449
today, you'd feel sore tomorrow too.
Take a day off, and start again.

00:50:32.449 --> 00:50:33.449
&gt;&gt; Okay. Thanks.

00:50:33.449 --> 00:50:38.281
&gt;&gt; Sure. Wasn't it a great run this morning?

00:50:38.281 --> 00:50:40.630
&gt;&gt; Oh, awesome run.
Thanks for joining us.

00:50:40.630 --> 00:50:47.400
During your research, did you come across
any other cultures similar to the Tarahumara

00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:51.079
that kind of provided that glimpse into our
evolutionary history?

00:50:51.079 --> 00:50:55.330
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you know, that's a great point.
They're everywhere.

00:50:55.330 --> 00:51:01.569
When the professors at the University of Utah
were trying to substantiate their theory of

00:51:01.569 --> 00:51:05.839
hunting pack -- humans as hunting pack animals
 -- they started digging in folklore mythology,

00:51:05.839 --> 00:51:09.549
and what they found was -- everybody's got
folklore about running animals to death.

00:51:09.549 --> 00:51:12.680
The Seris, the Hopis, the Navahos, Kalahari
Bushmen.

00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:18.760
Every culture everywhere has had a strong
ethos of long-distance running.

00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:23.829
But more and more, those cultures are disappearing,
you know.

00:51:23.829 --> 00:51:28.269
In Peru, you still have long distance runners
who act as couriers.

00:51:28.269 --> 00:51:34.870
The Sherpas, the Kalahari Bushmen.
There is a tiny group of Navahos to this day

00:51:34.870 --> 00:51:42.700
who still use long distance running as ritual,
and so do the Hopi's.

00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:48.329
Anybody else? Chance.
My brother's here.

00:51:48.329 --> 00:51:50.650
Wide open field, man.
[chuckle] Yeah? Nothing else?

00:51:50.650 --> 00:51:53.210
Again, thanks very much.
This is a lot of fun.

00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:54.210
I really appreciate it.

00:51:54.210 --> 00:51:59.609
&gt;&gt; [Applause]
