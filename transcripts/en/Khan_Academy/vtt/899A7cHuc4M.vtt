00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.833
(upbeat music)

00:00:00.833 --> 00:00:01.666
- It was amazing.
- One sentence,

00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:03.100
I don't think I'll ever forget in my life,

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.460
Mom, I made it to Harvard.

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.079
It was like a Bollywood
Hollywood kind of a sentence.

00:00:08.079 --> 00:00:09.297
- Well I'm Shrey.

00:00:09.297 --> 00:00:12.100
I'm a freshman in Harvard, Class of 2022.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.270
And I'm from New Delhi, India.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:16.650
I've been using Khan
Academy for quite a while,

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.637
6th grade, probably.

00:00:18.637 --> 00:00:21.470
(uplifting music)

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.623
Chemistry is a subject that,

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.850
if you're not clear with the fundamentals

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:29.640
or the building blocks,

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.650
you will really struggle a lot

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.730
when you get to the higher concepts.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.560
When I struggled with Chemistry,

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.640
it was more about not
getting enough attention

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.420
on the basic fundamental things,

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.303
or the class being just
too fast-paced for me.

00:00:47.303 --> 00:00:50.600
(upbeat music)

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.470
Khan Academy eliminated that
for me to a great extent,

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.550
'cause I didn't have to feel bad

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.500
about watching the same
video over and over again.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.380
I could watch it at a slower pace.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.660
I could do millions of questions

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.240
at the same level, at
the fundamental level,

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.660
and that was great, actually,

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.883
'cause I was learning at my own pace.

00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:13.470
(electronic chime)

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.420
Khan Academy teaching just eliminates

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.120
any sort of learning gap.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.570
- This access to education
is the greatest gift

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.180
which we can give to our kids,

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.040
wherever they are in this world.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.400
If they have access to
this kind of education

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.850
through technology, through digital means,

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.750
through platforms like Khan Academy,

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.250
they can achieve anything.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.120
A child sitting in any
corner of the world,

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.730
if they have this access
to these resources,

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:37.780
anything is possible.
