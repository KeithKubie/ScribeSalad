00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.620
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank you
all so much for coming.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.330
It's my pleasure to introduce
our very special guest, Ira

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:11.273
Glass.

00:00:11.273 --> 00:00:16.964
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:16.964 --> 00:00:18.630
FEMALE SPEAKER: So
as I'm sure you know,

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.570
Ira is the award winning
host and executive producer

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.180
of the documentary radio
program, "This American

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.660
Life," produced by
Chicago Public Media

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.570
and distributed by Public
Radio International.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.730
The program began
in 1995 and is now

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.320
heard on over 500
public radio stations

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.840
each week by more than
three million people

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.350
and is downloaded as a podcast
more than 900,000 times weekly.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.715
So Ira, thanks for joining us.

00:00:42.715 --> 00:00:43.840
IRA GLASS: Glad to be here.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:44.490
FEMALE SPEAKER: I
want to start off

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.198
with some basic
questions about the show.

00:00:46.198 --> 00:00:46.950
IRA GLASS: OK.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.158
FEMALE SPEAKER: Where you
get the ideas for the show?

00:00:49.158 --> 00:00:52.231
What comes first, the
theme or the stories?

00:00:52.231 --> 00:00:53.980
IRA GLASS: I mean, I
get asked this a lot.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.000
I mean generally,
what will happen

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.270
is someone will pitch a story
which we just love as a staff.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.280
Every two weeks,
we have a meeting

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.940
where we generate
new story ideas,

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.898
and then people are always
looking for stories.

00:01:07.898 --> 00:01:09.890
And so somebody
will pitch a story

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.871
that we just all feel
very excited about

00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:13.620
and that doesn't go
with any of the themes

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.107
that we have going
on at the time,

00:01:16.107 --> 00:01:17.690
and so we'll just
basically say, look,

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.410
let's do that story as the
anchor for some new show,

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.786
and then we'll concoct a theme
that could possibly contain it.

00:01:24.786 --> 00:01:26.660
And sometimes we'll come
up with two or three

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.780
different themes that
could possibly contain it,

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.641
and then we'll look
on a list of here's

00:01:30.641 --> 00:01:32.640
some stories that are
left over from other shows

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.540
and we never used, and see if
we could glue anything to it,

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.594
and then we'll
start on a search.

00:01:37.594 --> 00:01:39.510
And then that search can
take us between three

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.080
or four months often,
and sometimes even more,

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.130
and finding ideas for
stories is generally-- for us

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.974
and I think for
anybody-- inefficient.

00:01:52.974 --> 00:01:54.390
I think one of the
things when you

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.260
start to do creative
work that nobody really

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.236
talks to you about is, where
are ideas going to come from?

00:01:59.236 --> 00:02:00.610
And you have this
idea of they're

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.320
going to be sprinkled on
your head like fairy dust.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.870
And maybe this is it true in
engineering and other kinds

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.910
of work, too, but
where I just come from

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.330
is you have to just surround
yourself with a lot of stuff

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.530
and a lot of ideas because
ideas lead to other ideas.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.180
And so at some point, we'll just
go on a massive search which

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.204
will include Googling,
but also just doing

00:02:24.204 --> 00:02:25.120
all kinds of research.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.680
We'll brainstorm
different kinds of things

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.280
that could possibly
fit in the theme.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.654
Often, we're in
a situation where

00:02:29.654 --> 00:02:31.160
we'll have a very
serious story that

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.660
will be the anchor with a lot
of weight and a lot of stakes,

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.630
and so we'll just consciously
be looking for something

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:44.120
funny or light or more personal
or small, just something

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.200
so the whole episode
won't be so heavy.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.960
And for us to find three
or four stories that'll

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.140
end up on the air,
often, we'll look

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.560
at 15 or 25 different
story ideas.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.120
And we'll go into production
often on seven or eight

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.440
stories, and then we
just have to start

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.180
making them and
commissioning writers

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.680
and flying people
around the country

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.750
and interviewing
people, and then we

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.150
kill a tremendous
amount of material.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.040
It just was built into
our production model

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.831
from the beginning that
we would be killing

00:03:13.831 --> 00:03:16.785
between a third and a half
of everything we start.

00:03:16.785 --> 00:03:18.660
And it's sort of like
for the kind of stories

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.930
we're doing where we need
them to be relatable,

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.080
we need a strong
character-- at least one,

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.630
if not more than one-- we
need there to be a plot,

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.190
the plot has to
be surprising, it

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.870
has to do lead to some new
thought about the world,

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.610
that thought has
to be surprising.

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.960
It's a lot of
criteria to have going

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.630
and you really can't
tell what's going

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.380
to work until you start
to make the thing.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.360
And so it's like
you want lightning

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.810
to strike as an industrial
product every week,

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.920
and to do that, you just
have to wander around

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.222
in the rain a lot.

00:03:54.222 --> 00:03:56.180
FEMALE SPEAKER: So learning
how much you record

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.370
and how little of it
actually gets onto the show

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.450
is pretty surprising to me.

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:01.907
What else surprises people?

00:04:01.907 --> 00:04:04.240
IRA GLASS: Because in your
view, we just open up the mic

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.920
and people are
incredibly charming.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.239
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yes.

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:08.030
IRA GLASS: If only.

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.990
FEMALE SPEAKER: I
think somebody comes up

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:10.180
to you at a dinner
party and says,

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.870
Ira, I have this
great story, and then

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.460
you say, let's
record it right now,

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.510
and then suddenly it's
on the radio that week.

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:16.895
IRA GLASS: That
would be a dream.

00:04:16.895 --> 00:04:18.232
My job would be very easy.

00:04:18.232 --> 00:04:20.440
FEMALE SPEAKER: So what else
usually surprises people

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.040
about the production
of the show?

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.084
IRA GLASS: I mean,
it's a lot of us now.

00:04:26.084 --> 00:04:28.500
When we started the show, it
was just three people and me,

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.130
and now it's a dozen
of us making it.

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.129
I don't know what would
be surprising to people.

00:04:35.884 --> 00:04:37.300
When you see a
movie, you can just

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.580
feel all the money
and all the people

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.621
behind it, whereas a radio
show, if it's working,

00:04:40.621 --> 00:04:43.160
it just feels like one person
talking to another person,

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.800
and so the machinery
of it is invisible.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.700
If it's done well, you
don't get the feeling

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.680
that we've spent four
months editing and reediting

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.210
and reediting and going
back and doing things again.

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.585
So I think in general, the
machinery of it is surprising.

00:04:57.585 --> 00:04:59.334
FEMALE SPEAKER: What
about the interviews?

00:04:59.334 --> 00:05:00.790
Do you do them face to face?

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.350
IRA GLASS: Some, but it
doesn't have to face to face.

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.910
It's funny with radio,
I'll do interviews

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.800
where I'll be in a
studio in one city

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.210
and somebody will be in
a studio in another city.

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.380
And we use the incredibly
primitive technology of I'll

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.674
be in the studio and talking
to them over the phone,

00:05:19.674 --> 00:05:21.340
and we'll send an
engineer who will just

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:22.700
sit there with a microphone.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.375
So I'm recording
my voice where I am

00:05:24.375 --> 00:05:26.390
and they record their voice
on a recorder where they are,

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:27.890
and then we just
synchronize the two

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:30.470
tapes so it sounds like
we're in the same room.

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:32.150
Very complicated.

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.486
And it turns out
for many things,

00:05:36.486 --> 00:05:38.360
that's just as good as
being there in person.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.734
It doesn't matter
if you're there

00:05:39.734 --> 00:05:41.960
for a lot of things, even
very personal things.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.418
Because it's almost
like we're used

00:05:43.418 --> 00:05:48.560
to talking to people on
the phone very personally,

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.040
and it's almost like the
conversation is happening

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.004
in the space of radio,
if that makes sense.

00:05:53.004 --> 00:05:54.420
And I know that
some interviewers,

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.290
like Terry Gross,
who does "Fresh Air,"

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:59.272
she prefers not to be in
the studio with the people.

00:05:59.272 --> 00:06:00.480
She doesn't want to see them.

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.030
She doesn't want them to see
her going through her notes.

00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:07.230
FEMALE SPEAKER: So I'd love
to hear you talk about some

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:08.340
of your favorite episodes.

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.750
I know "Testosterone,"
I think is one of them,

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:11.920
and "Hartford High."

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.782
What do you think makes
those so successful?

00:06:14.782 --> 00:06:16.990
IRA GLASS: I mean, those
are such different episodes.

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:22.340
I mean, the episodes
that are good

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.310
have a really nice mix of
being relatable and surprising

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:30.630
and take you into a world
that you kind of know

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:34.690
exists but don't really
know the details of.

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:38.720
"Harper High School," it
was a two episode thing.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:39.890
We'd never done that before.

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:42.150
And basically, it came out
of our senior producer,

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:45.070
Julie Snyder, being really
interested in trying

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:50.840
to figure out a way to cover
gun violence in Chicago.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.430
Last year, 506 people,
I think it was,

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:57.277
were shot in one
year in Chicago,

00:06:57.277 --> 00:06:59.360
and the number was going
up whereas the number was

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.300
going down or staying the
same in other big cities,

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:06.560
and it was very unclear why the
number was so high in Chicago.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.790
560 is a huge number.

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:12.000
New York is three times
larger than Chicago,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.290
and the number of shootings in
New York was smaller than that.

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:19.410
And in the coverage
of it, it was

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:22.250
really hard to even understand
the most basic things

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.330
like, why are people
shooting each other?

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:26.810
You would read in the
clippings, so somebody got shot

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:30.010
at the corner of 70th and Stony
Island, and you wouldn't know.

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:31.560
Was it a drug thing?

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.431
Was it a gang thing?

00:07:32.431 --> 00:07:33.430
Was it a domestic thing?

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:34.840
You couldn't even know.

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:39.400
And so we were looking for
a way to get a grip on it,

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.790
and if you're us, the
first thing we need

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:45.780
is plot and story
and characters,

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:48.490
and so we have to find a
place to locate the story.

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:53.460
And the first thing we tried was
on Memorial Day of that year,

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.234
50 people were shot
in one weekend,

00:07:55.234 --> 00:07:56.400
in the Memorial Day weekend.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.270
We felt like, OK,
that'll be our frame.

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:00.560
We'll just do
Memorial Day weekend

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:04.760
and we'll do those 50 shootings.

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:09.270
And that turned out to be
unproducable in the time frame

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:11.485
we wanted because once
the people were caught up

00:08:11.485 --> 00:08:13.970
in the court system, we couldn't
get people to talk to us,

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:16.355
and we couldn't report out the
stories with the kind of speed

00:08:16.355 --> 00:08:17.870
that you'd want to
to get it on the air.

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:19.160
And then we went looking
for another frame

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.650
and we found this high
school, Harper High School,

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:25.940
where 29 kids had
been shot in one year.

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:27.830
I can't remember
if it's nine-- they

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:29.770
were current or recent students.

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:32.268
So recent students are sort
of like a kid who dropped out

00:08:32.268 --> 00:08:34.809
as a sophomore, but now he would
have been in his junior year

00:08:34.809 --> 00:08:36.767
and still friends with
everybody in the school.

00:08:36.767 --> 00:08:39.900
We were counting those because
the school counted them.

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:42.309
So it was 29 current
and recent students

00:08:42.309 --> 00:08:45.722
and eight or nine of
them died in one year.

00:08:45.722 --> 00:08:47.305
And if you just think
about the trauma

00:08:47.305 --> 00:08:49.480
a school goes through
if there's one shooting,

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.130
and so this is 29 of them.

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:54.120
And this wasn't
the most shootings

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:55.781
in Chicago or anything.

00:08:55.781 --> 00:08:57.780
And I think what makes
an episode like that work

00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.260
is that, honestly, most of
us have no idea what it's

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.010
like to live in a community
where that many people are

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:05.390
getting shot.

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:07.960
We sent in three
reporters for five months

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.600
to just camp out in
that school and get

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:13.010
to know the staff
and the students.

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:17.920
And what was interesting
was both being

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:21.130
able to document what
that level of violence

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:23.990
does to the kids with
the kind of detail

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:26.200
that you don't get to
report out that much.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:31.130
And so there was one kid
who was like the Forrest

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:32.630
Gump of the shootings
at the school.

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:36.670
He had been at six or
seven different shootings,

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:39.090
kids who he knows, close to.

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:41.380
He would just be standing
there, they would die right

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:42.921
in front of them,
and his own brother

00:09:42.921 --> 00:09:46.060
had been shot three
times and survived,

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:49.960
but was in a wheelchair at
the end of the last shooting.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:55.730
And where that kid is
after that turns out

00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:59.677
to be something
worth talking about.

00:09:59.677 --> 00:10:01.760
And then the staff of the
school was really great,

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:06.740
kind of the crypto message
of the show, I guess,

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:08.580
was here is like an
inner city high school,

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:10.204
and people bring all
these associations

00:10:10.204 --> 00:10:13.170
to that, and the
super competent staff.

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:15.670
And when there was a shooting,
they had all these procedures

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:18.030
that they had developed,
learning from the Army

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:20.360
these after action reports
where they would just

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.850
jump into action to figure
out, if this kid got shot,

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:24.272
who else did this kid know?

00:10:24.272 --> 00:10:25.230
What gang were they in?

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:26.420
What gang is warring
with that gang?

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:28.961
And they would just get all the
other kids who could possibly

00:10:28.961 --> 00:10:31.930
get shot out of the
school and to their homes

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:34.020
to get people to safety.

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:42.940
And just so much about that
show was really surprising,

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:45.820
so that made that work.

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:48.389
I could talk about this
show for a long time.

00:10:48.389 --> 00:10:50.680
Gangs in that school turned
out to be really different.

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:52.730
It made me feel like
such an old person.

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:55.440
The gangs, when I was a
reporter in Chicago reporting

00:10:55.440 --> 00:11:00.654
on gangs 15, 20 years ago,
gangs were a criminal enterprise

00:11:00.654 --> 00:11:02.820
like you'd see on "The
Wire," and they'd sell drugs,

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:03.710
and they were out to make money.

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:05.335
And I just felt like,
these kids today,

00:11:05.335 --> 00:11:06.960
they don't even
want to make money.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:10.390
They're not even selling drugs.

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:12.610
And the parents are
sort of like what I was.

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:14.800
They thought a street
gang was one thing,

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:18.540
and all these things are--
if you heard the show,

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:20.380
it's like your
high school clique.

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:22.540
And it's just like
a bunch of kids,

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:25.180
but everybody can get a gun.

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:28.050
And so it's just like
basically, the neighborhood

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:31.060
is so dangerous, every kid
in the school was in a gang.

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:37.080
The nerds were in the gangs, the
drama kids were in the gangs,

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:38.860
the band kids were in the gang.

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:40.450
Every kid, you had
to be in a gang.

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:42.070
Every kid was in a gang.

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:45.750
And so you'd read
about this 15-year-old

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:47.890
that summer got shot.

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:50.400
And you'd read in the paper,
she was a member of a gang.

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.150
Every kid is in the gang.

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:53.710
She was a band kid.

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:01.980
So a lot of that was
surprising, and I

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:03.480
feel like that's
what makes it good.

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:05.090
There were characters
who, when you

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:12.990
would hear their situation--
the secret power of the radio

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:16.080
or the special power of
doing something on the radio

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:19.480
is the fact that
you don't see them.

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.600
It's easy to create
the kind of intimacy

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:25.020
where you feel like you can
get to know people very,

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:27.330
very quickly.

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:31.170
We did a TV show for two years
and we've done two movies,

00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:35.630
and I feel like you can
create that kind of intimacy

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:39.490
on film or on video,
but you'd really

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:41.530
have to shoot it like a film.

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:42.950
You'd have to light
it beautifully

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:45.610
you'd have to like really
frame it beautifully,

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:47.670
and just to bring the
kind of production values

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:50.110
that you'd have to bring
to it to make those stories

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:53.980
work with the sort of immediacy
and emotional intimacy

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:55.440
that you get on
radio, you'd have

00:12:55.440 --> 00:13:01.480
to really throw a tremendous
amount of money and production

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:02.140
value at it.

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:04.700
It really would have
to be shot like a film,

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:06.982
whereas with us, we're going
out with tape recorders.

00:13:06.982 --> 00:13:08.940
And just the fact that
you don't see the people

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:12.747
and you hear their voice, that
has such an immediacy to it

00:13:12.747 --> 00:13:15.080
that I feel like that's the
special power that radio can

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:16.770
bring to something like that.

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:20.750
And you just feel like you
get to know the people so fast

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:22.630
and you're so close
up in their world

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:24.580
that it's easy to
imagine, here's

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:26.900
what it would be
like to be them.

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:30.310
I mean, this is a really
long answer to your question,

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:33.000
but I feel like
the thing that we

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.320
can contribute as reporters
in the world that is harder

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:41.800
to achieve than other
kinds of journalism

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.310
is to do the most basic
thing that a story can do,

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:47.670
which is make it possible
to imagine, oh, here's

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:49.439
what it would be like to be you.

00:13:49.439 --> 00:13:51.480
And I feel like something
like that, where you're

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.670
talking about gang kids
and things like that, where

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:55.171
I think people who
are not in a gang

00:13:55.171 --> 00:13:57.086
or didn't grow up in
that kind of neighborhood

00:13:57.086 --> 00:13:58.762
bring all kinds of
associations to it,

00:13:58.762 --> 00:14:00.195
to be able to illustrate,
no, no, no, here's

00:14:00.195 --> 00:14:00.830
what it's really like.

00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:01.910
If you lived in
this neighborhood,

00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:03.170
you would be in the gang.

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:08.080
Here's how you would feel
and here's how you would be.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:11.606
That's what we're trying.

00:14:11.606 --> 00:14:12.950
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:14.449
IRA GLASS: Oh my
god that was silly.

00:14:14.449 --> 00:14:16.120
Too long.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:19.115
I'll be more terse as we go on.

00:14:19.115 --> 00:14:20.990
FEMALE SPEAKER: So when
I heard that episode,

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:23.031
it was very affecting,
and you leave that episode

00:14:23.031 --> 00:14:24.537
and you say, what
can I do to help?

00:14:24.537 --> 00:14:26.870
And I think there was some
sort of donations for Harper.

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:28.357
Was there on the website?

00:14:28.357 --> 00:14:30.190
IRA GLASS: The school
set up a donation page

00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:31.856
and they made a quarter
million dollars.

00:14:31.856 --> 00:14:34.440
And if anybody wants to
go, they can use the money.

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:35.880
They're a public school.

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:37.770
But what can you do to help?

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:40.710
There's nothing
you can do to help.

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:41.790
Nothing you can do.

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:48.360
I honestly believe it wasn't the
kind of thing where-- I mean,

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:51.310
maybe it's cynical to
say that, but are you

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:54.630
going to change the social
structure of the south side

00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:57.670
of Chicago so that kids don't
want to join gangs, or make

00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:59.681
the neighborhood a
safe neighborhood?

00:14:59.681 --> 00:15:01.180
I mean, you know
how you could help,

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:05.040
is if you could revive
the economy of that part

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:09.680
of the city of Chicago so that
the entire neighborhood became

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:11.747
safer because the
economic level would rise.

00:15:11.747 --> 00:15:13.080
I think that would be the thing.

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:15.700
But the fact is in our country,
where pockets of violence

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:20.740
happen, it's very poor
pockets in cities,

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:24.874
and unless you fix that.

00:15:24.874 --> 00:15:26.290
FEMALE SPEAKER:
But with episodes,

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:30.060
like "Very Tough Love," you
made the story, I think,

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:32.080
because you wanted to
tell that story, but--

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.840
IRA GLASS: "Very Tough
Love," it's about this judge.

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:35.464
There was a judge
down in Georgia who--

00:15:35.464 --> 00:15:38.450
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah, Judge
Amanda Williams was in Georgia,

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:41.560
and there was an episode about
her drug corps and some very

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:42.360
strict rulings.

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.872
And then after
the episode aired,

00:15:43.872 --> 00:15:46.244
there were some real world
consequences for her.

00:15:46.244 --> 00:15:48.660
So when you told that story,
were you thinking in the back

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:50.076
to your mind,
what's Georgia going

00:15:50.076 --> 00:15:51.510
to do once this
airs, or were you

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:55.590
just telling it to tell
an interesting story?

00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:57.510
IRA GLASS: I mean, it
was first and foremost

00:15:57.510 --> 00:16:00.626
an interesting story.

00:16:00.626 --> 00:16:03.214
That story, man.

00:16:03.214 --> 00:16:04.130
I was down in Georgia.

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:07.060
We had this idea for a show
called "Georgia Rambler," based

00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:08.905
on an old newspaper
column, and the idea

00:16:08.905 --> 00:16:11.630
is that this guy would roll
into different small towns

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:15.557
in Georgia, this
columnist, Charles Salter.

00:16:15.557 --> 00:16:17.140
He would just show
up in a town and he

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:20.220
would find a story that
day about that town,

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:22.120
and it was just portraits
of small town life.

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:24.257
And as a staff, we just
thought, that would be fun.

00:16:24.257 --> 00:16:24.840
Let's do that.

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:25.923
So we each chose a county.

00:16:25.923 --> 00:16:28.100
We'd just pick
names out of a hat.

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:32.390
And so I ended up with
the county that turned out

00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:34.620
to be the county that
this judge was in,

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:37.800
and you're given one day to
find a story under these rules

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:39.760
that we artificially
created for ourselves just

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:41.120
to amuse ourselves.

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:46.450
And I had been in the county--
literally the first interview

00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:49.380
I did was somebody who was like,
you know who you should talk

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:51.460
to is this guy, Joe
[INAUDIBLE], and he's

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:53.000
in this war with this judge.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.480
And I heard about
the judge right away,

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:59.610
and people kept telling me
stories about the judge.

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:04.819
And I totally had this feeling
of, if these stories are true,

00:17:04.819 --> 00:17:07.859
somebody should really
investigate this judge.

00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:09.800
And I totally had
the feeling of,

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:11.329
some reporter should
come down here.

00:17:15.172 --> 00:17:17.380
And honestly, when people
would tell me these stores,

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:20.770
I couldn't tell if
the stories were true.

00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:23.069
I really had a feeling
of, this can't be true.

00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:24.980
And then pinning it
down and getting people

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:28.369
to go on the record took
four or five months.

00:17:28.369 --> 00:17:30.940
Every time I would fly back
down there, my wife and my staff

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:33.910
were just like, why are
you doing this story?

00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:36.780
And then it turned
out people were

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:38.860
willing to come forward
and go on the record.

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:41.110
And I did have a feeling
in the back of my mind,

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:44.550
somebody should do something
about this if this is true.

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:47.501
And I don't feel like
I can claim credit.

00:17:47.501 --> 00:17:49.750
At the same time that people
were saying things to me,

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:53.770
they were saying things to--
there's a watchdog state

00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:56.550
committee that looks for judges
who might be doing things that

00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:59.800
are bad, and they had been
tipped off about this judge

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:01.770
and they were
looking into it too.

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:05.079
But I think the visibility of
the radio show and the fact

00:18:05.079 --> 00:18:06.620
that people from
all over the country

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:11.290
heard it gave it a
visibility in Georgia.

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:14.910
And honestly, hearing it
on the radio, a woman who

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:17.360
had been on the
State Supreme Court

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:19.660
got involved in the case
as one of the people moving

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:21.880
the case forward.

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:25.670
It raised the profile of it
in a way that is very rare.

00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:30.660
Honestly, most journalism
doesn't achieve anything.

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:33.850
And I think I got
into journalism,

00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:37.470
like most young
people, thinking,

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:39.000
I'm going to make
the world a better

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.790
place by exposing wrongdoing.

00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:44.440
But honestly, most
wrongdoing that you expose,

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:47.250
nothing happens.

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:51.630
You can do all the stories you
want on Guantanamo and things

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:57.710
that somebody should get in
there and fix-- climate change.

00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:00.810
Everybody who is going to
believe that climate change is

00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:03.390
real pretty much believes it,
and yet we're not actually

00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:06.060
addressing the
problem in a way that

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:08.840
is at the scale of
the problem itself.

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:12.200
And I just feel like, what
is left to say as a reporter?

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:15.230
It's happening, there's more
and more evidence all the time.

00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:19.400
We can say it again,
but you already know it.

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:21.120
And so generally, when
you're a reporter,

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:23.491
almost nothing gets
any results ever.

00:19:23.491 --> 00:19:25.240
That's one of the very
few times I've ever

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:27.790
worked on anything that
I could say afterwards,

00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:30.572
I helped in any way the
process of something changing.

00:19:30.572 --> 00:19:32.780
FEMALE SPEAKER: What about
people's individual lives?

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:35.280
Do they follow up with you and
say, after I was on the show,

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:36.859
this happened?

00:19:36.859 --> 00:19:39.150
IRA GLASS: After I was on
the show, a lot of my friends

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:42.380
got in contact with
me over Twitter.

00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:43.820
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Real world change.

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:46.531
IRA GLASS: Real world change.

00:19:46.531 --> 00:19:47.280
I mean, sometimes.

00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:57.030
Often, we're just documenting
people's personal stories,

00:19:57.030 --> 00:20:03.392
and I don't know how much--
I mean, I don't know.

00:20:03.392 --> 00:20:05.850
FEMALE SPEAKER: Maybe they
would get back in touch with you

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:08.480
and say, hey Ira, I was really
having a problem with that.

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:09.530
Now it worked out.

00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:11.350
Or just wanted to let you know.

00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:15.974
IRA GLASS: No, not that often.

00:20:15.974 --> 00:20:18.670
No, no, no.

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:21.201
Like, no, I told that story
about my mom and she heard it

00:20:21.201 --> 00:20:22.200
and now she's mad at me.

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:25.222
There's a little bit of that.

00:20:25.222 --> 00:20:27.430
FEMALE SPEAKER: What about
episodes that just flopped

00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:29.850
or made you uncomfortable
or maybe listening back

00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:32.080
to some old ones, you feel
like you didn't cover them

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:34.190
in the way you would now?

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:38.890
IRA GLASS: I mean, there
definitely are things-- yeah,

00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:39.850
there's a lot.

00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:41.220
I mean, we're on a lot.

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:43.020
We made a lot of episodes.

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:45.220
And there are
things, definitely,

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:50.115
that I really wish we
could have done better.

00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:54.620
I wish I could
think of an example

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:57.010
very quickly for you of one.

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:05.020
There's one that we did
last week that on staff, we

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:07.900
wondered if we handled literally
the structure of the show

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:09.170
properly.

00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:11.960
And it was this one which
was built around an idea

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:12.650
that I love.

00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:15.280
One of our producers,
Sarah Koenig, her mom

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:17.620
has seven rules on things
you should never talk about.

00:21:20.697 --> 00:21:22.530
Unless you're going
through a health crisis,

00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:24.200
you should never talk
about your health,

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:26.034
like oh, I have this
problem in my shoulder.

00:21:26.034 --> 00:21:27.700
You should never talk
about your dreams.

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:29.910
You should never talk about
how you slept last night,

00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:33.360
and number one on her list the
route you took to get there.

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:34.810
Nobody's interested.

00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:36.830
And so she has seven
stories, and we thought,

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:38.538
this a really funny
premise for the show.

00:21:38.538 --> 00:21:41.140
And Sarah said, well, what
if we could prove you wrong?

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:42.920
I work with a team of people.

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:45.470
We're very committed to
finding interesting stories

00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:46.430
on any subject.

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:50.102
What if we can prove that there
could be stories on these seven

00:21:50.102 --> 00:21:51.560
subjects that could
be interesting?

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:53.810
And her mother is like, I
don't believe you can do it.

00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:56.800
And then it was
very much like, OK,

00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:59.359
the first scene
of "My Fair Lady."

00:21:59.359 --> 00:22:01.150
I can take this woman
with a cockney accent

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:02.191
and make her into a lady.

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:05.880
That's our mission.

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:08.790
And so we set out as a staff
to find seven stories that

00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:13.420
would totally be amazing
stories of those seven subjects.

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:17.555
And Sarah Koenig is just such an
amazing interviewer and writer

00:22:17.555 --> 00:22:18.430
on the radio.

00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:26.580
And somehow, when
the show was done,

00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:28.420
all of a sudden the
feeling of, oh wait,

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:29.690
did we format the show wrong?

00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:31.360
And this is such a
nerdy thing, but we

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:33.830
keep coming back to the
mom throughout the hour

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:35.570
to check in of like, well,
what did you think of that one?

00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:36.970
What did you think of that one?

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:38.600
And then we realized
at the end-- which

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:40.510
seemed like since
there's a drama of what

00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:41.760
is she going to
think of each story

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:44.009
and is she going to give the
thumbs up or thumbs down?

00:22:44.009 --> 00:22:46.810
But somehow, weirdly,
I think for listeners,

00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:48.080
that lowered the stakes.

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:49.780
Did you guys hear this one?

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:52.225
Was it a thumbs up or
thumbs down episode?

00:22:52.225 --> 00:22:53.134
Thumbs up?

00:22:53.134 --> 00:22:55.050
How many of you are
thumbs down on it, though?

00:22:55.050 --> 00:22:56.170
Some thumbs down.

00:22:56.170 --> 00:22:59.810
Because the drama
doesn't play perfectly.

00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:03.200
And some of the staffers-- I
was very much on the side of,

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:05.362
we must have the
mom in the studio

00:23:05.362 --> 00:23:07.820
because the drama is, is the
mom going to give us thumbs up

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:08.445
or thumbs down?

00:23:08.445 --> 00:23:12.320
And we'll just do it like we'll
tell the stories to the mom.

00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:14.635
And then there was a
whole contingent on staff

00:23:14.635 --> 00:23:15.927
who were just like, no, no, no.

00:23:15.927 --> 00:23:17.343
It's going to be
more entertaining

00:23:17.343 --> 00:23:18.500
not to have the mom there.

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:23.889
And I wonder if we
did the wrong thing.

00:23:23.889 --> 00:23:26.180
I wonder if it would have
been better just to come back

00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:27.615
to the mom at the
end and just let

00:23:27.615 --> 00:23:29.470
her say, nope, I'm still right.

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:35.631
FEMALE SPEAKER: What did
she say about the episode?

00:23:35.631 --> 00:23:38.170
IRA GLASS: She enjoyed
it, and she's still

00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:40.480
talking to Sarah,
which was our goal.

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:42.614
FEMALE SPEAKER: Well done.

00:23:42.614 --> 00:23:44.030
So one thing that
I was wondering.

00:23:44.030 --> 00:23:46.290
I read an interview you did
with "New York Magazine,"

00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:50.630
and you gave some
snarky responses,

00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:53.700
and then some of your fans left
angry comments on the article

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:56.283
because you didn't match
their expectations of Ira.

00:23:56.283 --> 00:23:58.540
IRA GLASS: Wait, what
were my snarky responses?

00:23:58.540 --> 00:23:59.390
What did I say?

00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:00.300
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'll
send you the link.

00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:01.551
IRA GLASS: I don't
even remember this.

00:24:01.551 --> 00:24:02.051
OK.

00:24:02.051 --> 00:24:03.870
FEMALE SPEAKER: And
you didn't match

00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:07.395
who they think Ira Glass is,
host of "This American Life."

00:24:07.395 --> 00:24:08.020
IRA GLASS: Wow.

00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:10.701
I am so glad I didn't
read these comments.

00:24:10.701 --> 00:24:11.200
OK.

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:12.080
Well, let's hear them.

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:13.250
FEMALE SPEAKER: So
the question is--

00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:13.916
IRA GLASS: Wait.

00:24:13.916 --> 00:24:16.539
Do you-- really-- yeah?

00:24:16.539 --> 00:24:18.080
FEMALE SPEAKER: Do
you think that you

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:21.380
match people's expectations
of who you are?

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:23.990
Are you the same person
as your narrator self?

00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:24.820
IRA GLASS: Oh.

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:27.180
I'm not the same person
as my narrator self.

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:30.540
My narrator self is a much more
edited down version of myself.

00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:34.160
Like any normal person,
when I go in public,

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:36.269
there's a lot less
cursing than in real life.

00:24:36.269 --> 00:24:38.060
FEMALE SPEAKER: That
was part of the snark.

00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:38.726
IRA GLASS: What?

00:24:38.726 --> 00:24:39.896
That I was cursing?

00:24:39.896 --> 00:24:40.770
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:43.112
IRA GLASS: What
the fuck did I say?

00:24:43.112 --> 00:25:05.134
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:05.134 --> 00:25:07.550
I've been going around doing
this show with these dancers,

00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:08.633
with these modern dancers.

00:25:08.633 --> 00:25:09.267
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:09.267 --> 00:25:10.640
You guys saw the dance show?

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:14.770
So it sounds like it should be
awful, but it's fine, right?

00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:16.740
It's good.

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:19.860
So as I tell radio stories and
these two incredibly talented

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:21.667
women dance, and
really, it sounds

00:25:21.667 --> 00:25:23.500
like it would be terrible,
but it's actually

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:25.800
pretty moving and funny.

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:29.050
And there's a whole
section of the show where

00:25:29.050 --> 00:25:30.720
I tell a bunch of
stories, all of which

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:33.430
include the word "cocksucker,"
and I feel so aware

00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:34.600
of people in the audience.

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:36.890
It's like, OK, you came out
to the public radio event.

00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:38.430
Here I am, it's
just like cocksucker

00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:41.126
this and cocksucker that.

00:25:41.126 --> 00:25:47.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:50.718
Anyway, so what's the-- so my
expectation is that people's

00:25:50.718 --> 00:25:55.590
expectations-- I
think on the radio,

00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:59.375
I'm listening to people
in a more focused way,

00:25:59.375 --> 00:26:03.495
I've been told, than
I do in my real life.

00:26:03.495 --> 00:26:05.370
FEMALE SPEAKER: You're
doing great right now.

00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:05.750
IRA GLASS: Thank you.

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:07.499
Well, this is a focused
sort of situation.

00:26:10.812 --> 00:26:13.270
I had a friend who once said
that the difference between me

00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:18.090
on the radio and me in real
life is that on the radio,

00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:20.770
I'm just not distracted by the
500 other things I'm supposed

00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:24.000
to be doing at the same
time, whereas in real life,

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.300
I think I live in my
own little head a lot.

00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:30.958
FEMALE SPEAKER: That
makes a lot of sense.

00:26:30.958 --> 00:26:32.870
IRA GLASS: Thank
you for saying that.

00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:34.730
Other people in my
life, though, would

00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:37.770
contest that thought that
it makes a lot of sense,

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:40.500
and perhaps wish that it
could be a little different.

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:43.020
FEMALE SPEAKER: So you've sort
of become this cultural icon.

00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:44.760
How does it feel
when you see yourself

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:47.420
portrayed in pop culture?

00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:49.700
IRA GLASS: Well weirdly,
I'm not enough of an icon

00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:52.140
that people portray me
without me being involved.

00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:54.242
FEMALE SPEAKER: There
was the one on "The OC."

00:26:54.242 --> 00:26:56.200
I feel like you weren't
involved with that one.

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:58.330
IRA GLASS: "The OC," that
was a really special one.

00:26:58.330 --> 00:26:59.110
Yeah, but--

00:26:59.110 --> 00:27:00.080
FEMALE SPEAKER: Will
you tell that story?

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:00.906
I love that story.

00:27:00.906 --> 00:27:01.530
IRA GLASS: Yes.

00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:05.287
OK, so I was a super fan
of "The OC," and my wife

00:27:05.287 --> 00:27:06.620
and I would watch it every week.

00:27:09.697 --> 00:27:11.530
FEMALE SPEAKER: You
would sing "California."

00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:12.640
IRA GLASS: Yes, we would.

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:14.480
We were so into it that
at the beginning of each--

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:16.050
I've told this
story on the radio.

00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:18.950
At the beginning of each
episode, my wife and I

00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:22.840
would sit on the couch and we
would sing along with the song,

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:25.387
(SINGING) do, do,
do, do, do, do--

00:27:25.387 --> 00:27:26.470
FEMALE SPEAKER: I know it.

00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:38.130
IRA GLASS:
[SINGING_"CALIFORNIA"] And I

00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:42.402
think I had talked about
how much I like the show.

00:27:42.402 --> 00:27:44.110
I don't think it was
like a random-- that

00:27:44.110 --> 00:27:45.440
would have been so random.

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:46.940
FEMALE SPEAKER: But
it fits the character.

00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:47.440
IRA GLASS: It fits
the character.

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:50.000
So anyway, at some point-- I
actually have a clip of this.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:50.940
I didn't realize you were
going to bring this up,

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:54.100
but I brought a thing with
clips that sometimes-- I'll

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:55.400
just tell the story.

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:59.680
Anyway, so I was
watching "The OC,"

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:03.840
and there comes a point where
Seth and Summer are in a scene,

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:06.690
and I think there's
another girl in his room,

00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:09.040
that Blondie girl
was in his room.

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:11.075
And his girlfriend
Summer picks up

00:28:11.075 --> 00:28:12.700
and she's like, I
hear a woman's voice.

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:15.110
And he comes up with the
implausible-- he's like, oh,

00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:16.990
I've got the radio on.

00:28:16.990 --> 00:28:20.040
"This American Life"
is on the radio.

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:22.780
And then she says a
line which is like, oh,

00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:24.510
that show with--
hold on for a second.

00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:26.500
I am going to find it.

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:27.010
She says--

00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:28.870
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Some egghead thing.

00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:32.950
IRA GLASS: She says, oh, that
show of know it all hipsters?

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:37.990
Isn't that pretentious show?

00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:43.620
It was like a valentine from
Summer, who I love, of course.

00:28:48.170 --> 00:28:48.670
Here we go.

00:28:48.670 --> 00:28:49.960
Here's Seth's question to her.

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:51.290
Can we bring up the
sound to the computer?

00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:51.956
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:28:51.956 --> 00:28:53.300
-That sounded like a girl.

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:54.490
-[STAMMERS] Yeah.

00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:56.280
Well, sure.

00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:58.740
Because I'm listening to the
radio and "This American Life"

00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:00.397
is on, and so there's
a girl talking.

00:29:00.397 --> 00:29:01.230
[END AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:03.396
IRA GLASS: First of all,
that makes no sense at all.

00:29:03.396 --> 00:29:04.695
And then her reply, like--

00:29:04.695 --> 00:29:05.090
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:06.440
-Is that that show by
those hipster know-it-alls

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:09.023
that talk about how fascinating
ordinary people are?

00:29:09.023 --> 00:29:09.777
[SCOFFS] God.

00:29:09.777 --> 00:29:10.610
[END AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:13.110
IRA GLASS: Is that that show
where hipster know-it-alls talk

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:15.395
about how fascinating
ordinary people are?

00:29:15.395 --> 00:29:17.054
[SCOFFS]

00:29:17.054 --> 00:29:18.720
FEMALE SPEAKER: So
you were just sitting

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:20.290
on the couch and your
wife and you saw it?

00:29:20.290 --> 00:29:22.331
IRA GLASS: I totally had
a moment of, wait, wait.

00:29:22.331 --> 00:29:24.140
What just happened?

00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:25.320
What is happening?

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:26.090
What is happening?

00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:35.640
A character on the
WB just talked to us.

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:37.113
That was crazy.

00:29:37.113 --> 00:29:38.680
That was really-- it was crazy.

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:45.650
I was just like, is
this on everyone's TV?

00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:49.890
I really had a feeling of,
am I on some drug flashback

00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:51.080
right now?

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:54.280
It really was
really, really weird.

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:57.030
That's one of the
weirdest things

00:29:57.030 --> 00:29:58.909
that's happened for sure.

00:29:58.909 --> 00:30:01.075
FEMALE SPEAKER: Well, you
chose not to be on "Orange

00:30:01.075 --> 00:30:02.370
is the New Black."

00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:03.200
IRA GLASS: Yes.

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:04.200
FEMALE SPEAKER: Why not?

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:12.602
IRA GLASS: I didn't want to
be myself on another TV show.

00:30:12.602 --> 00:30:14.310
I don't know, I felt
like it was becoming

00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:16.510
a shtick of going on
TV shows and playing

00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:18.590
myself a little bit.

00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:20.820
I mean, this seems like
a bratty thing to say--

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:22.180
FEMALE SPEAKER: No, I think it
got the same message across.

00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:23.549
It didn't need to be you.

00:30:23.549 --> 00:30:25.090
As soon as I watched
it, I paused it.

00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:27.472
I googled, was this
supposed to be Ira Glass?

00:30:27.472 --> 00:30:29.180
And then it said yes,
and I was like, OK,

00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:30.430
I can continue watching.

00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:31.860
IRA GLASS: Yeah.

00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:35.334
FEMALE SPEAKER: The message
got across for your fans.

00:30:35.334 --> 00:30:36.500
IRA GLASS: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:37.660
That seemed fine.

00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:39.860
I wished them the best,
and do wish them the best.

00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:42.460
And it's good for the
business that the show

00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:46.042
was sort of there in
a weird crypto way.

00:30:46.042 --> 00:30:47.770
But I didn't want to do it.

00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:52.774
At that point-- I
didn't want to do it.

00:30:52.774 --> 00:30:54.440
FEMALE SPEAKER: So
shifting gears a bit,

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:56.229
just to talk about
technology, what's

00:30:56.229 --> 00:30:58.520
your favorite app or your
favorite piece of technology?

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:05.196
IRA GLASS: I use a MacBook
Air that I think is amazing.

00:31:05.196 --> 00:31:07.112
Am I allowed to mention
an Apple product here?

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:17.580
I'm constantly amazed at
the devices in my life.

00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:21.260
My friend Chris Ware is
this cartoonist and writer,

00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:24.380
and he says he feels like his
iPhone is like the tricorder he

00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:27.780
wished he had had as a
child watching "Star Trek."

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:28.949
It does all the things.

00:31:28.949 --> 00:31:29.990
It can tell you anything.

00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:36.920
But my technology use
is pretty-- basically,

00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:39.840
I'm editing on Pro Tools, I'm
writing, I'm sending emails,

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:43.417
I'm listening to music while
I run, and I'm using maps.

00:31:43.417 --> 00:31:45.250
FEMALE SPEAKER: So you
don't have Snap Chat?

00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:46.862
IRA GLASS: No.

00:31:46.862 --> 00:31:49.820
And also, I'm not on Twitter.

00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:51.660
I feel like I don't
need a creative outlet.

00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:54.160
I'm all set.

00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:56.420
I don't need a Tumblr.

00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:56.920
I'm good.

00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:58.905
I'm covered.

00:31:58.905 --> 00:32:00.280
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Is there anything

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:02.380
that you're waiting for, some
piece of technology where it's

00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:03.754
like, why doesn't
that exist yet?

00:32:03.754 --> 00:32:06.155
IRA GLASS: I have to say,
there was a piece of technology

00:32:06.155 --> 00:32:10.340
that I pitched people for
years and then Google invented.

00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:13.490
And I feel like our
entire radio show runs

00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:16.980
on this piece of
technology, and it's docs,

00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:19.910
it's that you can
share a document.

00:32:19.910 --> 00:32:22.160
And I used to meet software
engineers and I would say,

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:25.040
could you invent something so
that for the thing that we're

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:26.850
doing on our show-- we're
playing each other's stories,

00:32:26.850 --> 00:32:28.520
and then we go over
the scripts together.

00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:30.580
What you want is something so
that somebody in another city

00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:33.246
could be looking at the document
and you guys are both typing it

00:32:33.246 --> 00:32:35.820
at the same time, and people
at four or five different desks

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:37.700
can all be typing
on, making changes.

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:41.920
I was like, well,
that must be easy.

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:43.690
And I kept waiting
for somebody to do it,

00:32:43.690 --> 00:32:46.290
and then you guys did
it, and our whole show

00:32:46.290 --> 00:32:48.094
runs on Google Docs.

00:32:48.094 --> 00:32:50.260
FEMALE SPEAKER: Well, if
you think of anything else,

00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:51.860
this is the right
room to ask for it.

00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:52.380
IRA GLASS: Really?

00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:53.080
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:55.163
IRA GLASS: Can I just say,
in the Calendar program

00:32:55.163 --> 00:33:02.660
on the iPhone, it has
two what I consider bugs.

00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:05.180
It's on your phone and it
makes you type in your name

00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:07.130
and tell it who
you are every day.

00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:10.970
And so you'll be riding
a bike, realizing

00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:13.340
you have to check your
calendar, and then you

00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:15.910
have to stop and
enter in your name.

00:33:15.910 --> 00:33:17.631
That's not-- why?

00:33:17.631 --> 00:33:18.130
Why do you--

00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:20.360
FEMALE SPEAKER: It sounds
like a pitch for Glass.

00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:20.780
IRA GLASS: Really?

00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:21.670
For the glasses thing?

00:33:21.670 --> 00:33:22.090
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
because it's like, oh,

00:33:22.090 --> 00:33:23.490
it would just pop right up.

00:33:23.490 --> 00:33:24.156
IRA GLASS: Sure.

00:33:26.879 --> 00:33:27.670
FEMALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:30.350
Well, we'll talk to someone on
calendar, see what we can do.

00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:34.240
IRA GLASS: And then
it asks me every day,

00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:37.459
do I want it on my home screen,
and it's on my home screen.

00:33:37.459 --> 00:33:39.000
And there's no way
to tell it, you're

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.060
already living on
my home screen.

00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:42.130
Stop asking me.

00:33:42.130 --> 00:33:45.190
You live there now.

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:48.090
Look around.

00:33:48.090 --> 00:33:50.300
You're on the home screen.

00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:52.030
I can't give you
better placement.

00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:55.770
You have the number one
placement on the phone.

00:33:55.770 --> 00:33:57.380
You're at the top of the phone.

00:34:00.812 --> 00:34:02.770
I'm going think if I have
any other engineering

00:34:02.770 --> 00:34:03.850
problems I want to solve.

00:34:06.490 --> 00:34:07.760
No.

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:13.221
I feel like things have been
amazing with technology.

00:34:13.221 --> 00:34:15.179
There's a lot of things
wrong with this country

00:34:15.179 --> 00:34:21.779
and the world, but our computers
and phones, we're doing great.

00:34:21.779 --> 00:34:24.179
Also, cable TV, fine.

00:34:24.179 --> 00:34:25.219
Doing fine.

00:34:25.219 --> 00:34:26.549
Plenty of good TV to watch.

00:34:26.549 --> 00:34:28.840
FEMALE SPEAKER: Does any
piece of technology scare you?

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:38.784
IRA GLASS: I mean, no.

00:34:38.784 --> 00:34:40.409
Does any piece of
technology scare you?

00:34:40.409 --> 00:34:42.159
FEMALE SPEAKER: There's
all these articles

00:34:42.159 --> 00:34:43.840
about privacy and
people watching

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:45.052
you and ubiquitous cameras.

00:34:45.052 --> 00:34:46.510
I didn't know if
that was something

00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:47.547
that you worried about.

00:34:47.547 --> 00:34:48.130
IRA GLASS: No.

00:34:48.130 --> 00:34:51.969
I mean, I suppose I
should, but I don't.

00:34:51.969 --> 00:34:53.920
No.

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:56.239
Honestly, I'm so full of
fear about other things,

00:34:56.239 --> 00:34:57.210
I can't organize my--

00:34:57.210 --> 00:34:57.980
FEMALE SPEAKER: There's
not enough room.

00:34:57.980 --> 00:34:58.490
IRA GLASS: No, it's true.

00:34:58.490 --> 00:35:00.115
I feel like I'm
constantly on deadline,

00:35:00.115 --> 00:35:02.952
I'm constantly having to finish
things which aren't finished.

00:35:02.952 --> 00:35:04.410
Right now as I sit
here, I actually

00:35:04.410 --> 00:35:07.490
should be going through tape
about this car dealership

00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:09.600
so I could have a
draft of my story

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:12.130
by Monday, which is the
deadline I have for myself,

00:35:12.130 --> 00:35:15.542
and here I am sitting here.

00:35:15.542 --> 00:35:17.125
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Thanks for being here.

00:35:17.125 --> 00:35:18.430
IRA GLASS: Yeah.

00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:21.480
So with all of that fear
going through my system,

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:23.690
what time do I
have to be thinking

00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:27.380
about how I'm being surveilled
by cameras all the time who

00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:30.396
will watch me making my
stupid fucking story?

00:35:30.396 --> 00:35:31.770
What do I care?

00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:37.340
Go ahead, watch.

00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:40.440
FEMALE SPEAKER: So since your
radio show started in 1995,

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:42.440
how has technology
changed how you work?

00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:47.567
IRA GLASS: The basics
since '95 haven't changed.

00:35:47.567 --> 00:35:49.900
When I started in radio, I
was editing reel to reel tape

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:55.250
and stuff, and so I switched
over from analog to digital,

00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:58.069
but that happened
around '95, actually.

00:35:58.069 --> 00:36:00.360
The main way that technology
has changed the radio show

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:02.776
is that we can get it out to
more people more efficiently.

00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:09.876
Seth, when did we start
doing the podcast?

00:36:09.876 --> 00:36:10.804
SETH LIND: 2006.

00:36:10.804 --> 00:36:11.470
IRA GLASS: 2006.

00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:14.036
OK, so 2006, our
audience on the radio--

00:36:14.036 --> 00:36:16.410
that's Seth Lind, who runs
the business side of the radio

00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:17.732
show.

00:36:17.732 --> 00:36:21.134
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:21.134 --> 00:36:23.255
Seth, you'll be up
here-- what's that?

00:36:23.255 --> 00:36:25.038
SETH LIND: I said
our stock is up 3%.

00:36:28.872 --> 00:36:30.330
IRA GLASS: So 2006,
when we started

00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:31.940
the podcast, our
audience on the radio

00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:36.080
was about 1.8 million people
listening on 500 public radio

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:40.810
stations, which is middle
range for a public radio show,

00:36:40.810 --> 00:36:43.856
for a national show.

00:36:43.856 --> 00:36:46.060
"Morning Edition,"
kicks our ass,

00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:48.970
Garrison Keillor kicks
our ass, but we still

00:36:48.970 --> 00:36:50.795
have an edge over
"Radio Lab," thank god.

00:36:56.490 --> 00:36:57.105
Those guys.

00:37:02.337 --> 00:37:03.920
Since then, basically,
what's happened

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:06.294
is the radio audience has
stayed at about the same level.

00:37:10.054 --> 00:37:12.470
They actually measure radio
audiences more accurately now,

00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:13.980
so we know that the
number has been not 1.8,

00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:16.110
but it's been probably a
little higher than that.

00:37:16.110 --> 00:37:17.750
And the radio audience
has stayed there

00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:20.860
while we've gained basically
a million people every week

00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:24.040
downloading who we
didn't have before.

00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:26.200
And that was a real
question for radio

00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:28.860
when podcasting and internet
distribution would come in,

00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:30.269
how it would cannibalize radio.

00:37:30.269 --> 00:37:32.560
And I think in some parts of
radio, it's been very bad,

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:36.619
but for shows like ours, it's
been really, really good.

00:37:36.619 --> 00:37:37.660
That's been the main way.

00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:41.450
And I think part of the reason
why we work on the internet

00:37:41.450 --> 00:37:44.730
is because accidentally,
the aesthetics of the show

00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:48.130
match the aesthetics
of the internet.

00:37:48.130 --> 00:37:53.460
That is, I feel like most
communication on the internet

00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:56.840
is very much a very one to
one, I'm talking to you.

00:37:56.840 --> 00:38:00.150
And even if it's a
blog or something

00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:02.630
else like comments or
anything, it's very much,

00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:03.510
I'm writing to you.

00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:05.593
You're right there on the
other side of this thing

00:38:05.593 --> 00:38:07.190
and I'm talking
to you one on one,

00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:10.150
and radio is exactly
that when it's done well.

00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:15.570
And so I feel like it has the
feeling that it belongs there.

00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:17.960
We did nothing to market
it or make it successful.

00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:19.570
It just happened.

00:38:19.570 --> 00:38:21.070
FEMALE SPEAKER: So
with the podcast,

00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:23.680
you can listen to one episode,
you can listen to one act.

00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:24.760
You can pick and choose.

00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:28.450
Do you think that changes how
people consume your stories?

00:38:28.450 --> 00:38:29.450
IRA GLASS: I don't know.

00:38:29.450 --> 00:38:30.510
Honestly, Seth would
know better than this

00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:32.130
because he looks at the numbers.

00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:34.320
Do people listen to one
story, or are people

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:35.647
listening to whole episodes?

00:38:35.647 --> 00:38:36.730
SETH LIND: Whole episodes.

00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:36.860
IRA GLASS: They do.

00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:38.360
They're listening
to whole episodes.

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:42.500
Weirdly, figuring out how to
do journalism on the internet,

00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:45.010
like NPR and other
outfits have tried

00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:46.440
to figure out ways to do it.

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:47.940
And for a while,
they thought people

00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:49.600
would be curating
their own content,

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:53.320
and that you'd put out a
lot of small, little pieces

00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:55.469
of journalism, and
then people would

00:38:55.469 --> 00:38:57.010
like pick and choose
from among them.

00:38:57.010 --> 00:38:59.480
But it turns out people don't
want to go to the trouble

00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:03.380
generally, for audio, anyway.

00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:05.840
And one of the things that it
seems like people will listen

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:08.910
to is actually long
form narrative.

00:39:08.910 --> 00:39:12.120
And so yeah, I guess they're
listening to the whole hour.

00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:12.940
FEMALE SPEAKER: That's
interesting to hear.

00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:14.314
But with the live
stream, they're

00:39:14.314 --> 00:39:16.360
probably just tuning
in at some point.

00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:17.370
IRA GLASS: The live
stream is pretty new,

00:39:17.370 --> 00:39:18.424
though, so we don't know.

00:39:18.424 --> 00:39:20.340
FEMALE SPEAKER: That'll
be interesting to see.

00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:22.214
IRA GLASS: We have a 24
hour live stream now,

00:39:22.214 --> 00:39:28.117
a 24 hour radio station that
only plays us, which is a dream

00:39:28.117 --> 00:39:28.950
that I never wanted.

00:39:32.824 --> 00:39:35.490
FEMALE SPEAKER: So are there any
stories, maybe about technology

00:39:35.490 --> 00:39:37.130
or otherwise, that just
floating in your head

00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:39.546
that you've been trying to
find a way to tell on the radio

00:39:39.546 --> 00:39:42.280
but they don't fit
into a theme right now?

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:43.960
IRA GLASS: Not about technology.

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:47.470
Honestly, being here, I guess
I could have prepared more

00:39:47.470 --> 00:39:49.680
by thinking more about
technology and things

00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:50.670
like that.

00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:53.120
The only technology
story, truthfully,

00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:55.120
that I've been interested
in that we looked

00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:58.460
into that I still feel like
I don't totally understand

00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:08.490
is, why isn't there kind of a
moon shot sort of engineering

00:40:08.490 --> 00:40:09.950
solution to climate change?

00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:12.490
Why isn't that a
business for somebody

00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:16.000
to do to take carbon dioxide
out of the atmosphere

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.820
and like fix the actual planet?

00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:21.470
It seems like that's a
good business for somebody

00:40:21.470 --> 00:40:22.930
who knows about
things like that.

00:40:22.930 --> 00:40:23.590
FEMALE SPEAKER: Have
you looked into it?

00:40:23.590 --> 00:40:24.424
Are people doing it?

00:40:24.424 --> 00:40:25.756
IRA GLASS: We've looked into it.

00:40:25.756 --> 00:40:28.080
We reported it out a little
bit, and there are efforts

00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:32.650
and it's not an easy
technical problem

00:40:32.650 --> 00:40:34.935
to not consume more
energy in the process.

00:40:34.935 --> 00:40:35.810
You know what I mean?

00:40:38.910 --> 00:40:41.210
You don't want to
make the problem worse

00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:42.920
by solving the problem.

00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:45.710
So it turns out to be
a not trivial problem,

00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:49.610
but it also seems like it
isn't a big war going on

00:40:49.610 --> 00:40:51.750
to solve that problem.

00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:54.045
It seems like it's a
couple of people trying

00:40:54.045 --> 00:40:57.797
it, and not at a huge scale
either, is what we found out

00:40:57.797 --> 00:40:58.505
in our reporting.

00:40:58.505 --> 00:40:58.790
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Why don't you think

00:40:58.790 --> 00:40:59.750
people are more
worried about it?

00:40:59.750 --> 00:41:01.750
IRA GLASS: I don't know
enough about it to know.

00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:02.760
I don't know.

00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:04.800
I don't totally understand that.

00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:08.890
I feel like I'd have
to report it out more.

00:41:08.890 --> 00:41:10.660
FEMALE SPEAKER: So
if you had to choose

00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:14.600
one class for every student
to take, what would it be?

00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:18.245
IRA GLASS: Wow.

00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:22.650
A class that they
don't already take?

00:41:22.650 --> 00:41:24.630
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
or maybe tweaking

00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:27.502
the way something is done in
classrooms or in education.

00:41:27.502 --> 00:41:28.960
IRA GLASS: I mean,
there is a thing

00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:31.850
in writing that I feel like
I had to learn on my own

00:41:31.850 --> 00:41:34.630
that I'm surprised
isn't taught in school,

00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:37.330
and that is people don't
teach story structure properly

00:41:37.330 --> 00:41:38.250
in school.

00:41:38.250 --> 00:41:42.020
I think that when we're
all taught how to write,

00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:43.270
we're taught topic sentences.

00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:46.110
We're taught the way that you
would write an essay with topic

00:41:46.110 --> 00:41:47.450
sentences at the
beginning of paragraphs,

00:41:47.450 --> 00:41:48.991
and then you fill
out the paragraphs,

00:41:48.991 --> 00:41:51.640
and that basically was
learning to write in school.

00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:55.470
But in fact, there's
a structure of telling

00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:59.430
a story that's more effective
than that, that I feel like I

00:41:59.430 --> 00:42:02.870
had to learn by reading and
trial and error and whatever,

00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:05.260
which is much more
anecdote based.

00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:08.650
So for example, the stories on
our show, the structure of them

00:42:08.650 --> 00:42:12.570
is really built
around plot and ideas,

00:42:12.570 --> 00:42:13.900
and it's a very old structure.

00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:16.750
It's a very traditional
kind of story structure

00:42:16.750 --> 00:42:20.132
where you want to just think
through the sequence of actions

00:42:20.132 --> 00:42:22.340
where one thing leads to
the next, leads to the next,

00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:24.160
leads to the next.

00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:25.732
And so really, you
want to break down

00:42:25.732 --> 00:42:27.690
whatever is going to
happen into this happened,

00:42:27.690 --> 00:42:29.120
and then this happened, and
then this happened, and then

00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:29.680
happened.

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:32.710
And the advantage of
having forward motion

00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:34.392
is that it inherently
creates suspense

00:42:34.392 --> 00:42:36.350
because you wonder what's
going to happen next.

00:42:36.350 --> 00:42:39.650
And so you hold people's
attention because simply moving

00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:44.120
forward action, it's
like you create suspense

00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:50.880
and you can do it with the
most banal story possible,

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:52.230
or the most everyday story.

00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:54.570
And so as long as one thing
is leading to the next,

00:42:54.570 --> 00:42:56.920
is leading to the next,
you create suspense.

00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:59.440
And then periodically, you
want to jump out of the action

00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:02.110
and have some thought
about what the story means.

00:43:02.110 --> 00:43:05.710
And it's really the
structure of a sermon.

00:43:05.710 --> 00:43:08.380
A sermon is basically composed
of a series of anecdotes

00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:12.070
and then thoughts about
what the anecdotes are.

00:43:12.070 --> 00:43:15.060
Certain writers just
naturally write that way,

00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:17.664
and radio definitely
works best that way,

00:43:17.664 --> 00:43:19.330
and there's a certain
kind of journalism

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:20.380
that works that way, too.

00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:22.820
If you read a really
great narrative writer

00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:24.750
like Malcom Gladwell
or Michael Lewis,

00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:26.457
they're constantly
giving you the action

00:43:26.457 --> 00:43:28.540
and jumping out of the
action to make some thought

00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:30.300
and then back into the action.

00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:31.966
And that's the structure
of "Moneyball,"

00:43:31.966 --> 00:43:34.307
and that's the structure of
a lot of really great books.

00:43:34.307 --> 00:43:35.890
And when we're in
school, nobody tells

00:43:35.890 --> 00:43:38.890
us, that's a way to write
that's so much easier, actually,

00:43:38.890 --> 00:43:42.300
in a certain way, and is
so much more mesmerizing

00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:46.030
than topic sentences,
because you're

00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:48.370
utilizing this thing
that's so primal within us

00:43:48.370 --> 00:43:51.255
because you can create suspense.

00:43:51.255 --> 00:43:52.630
And I feel like
the thing that we

00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:54.713
don't learn when we're
learning to write in school

00:43:54.713 --> 00:43:56.822
is how to make it fascinating.

00:43:56.822 --> 00:43:58.530
FEMALE SPEAKER: That's
really interesting

00:43:58.530 --> 00:44:00.196
because in some of
our meetings earlier,

00:44:00.196 --> 00:44:02.710
we were learning about how
it's half technology and half

00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:04.300
the story because
you need people

00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:06.900
to adopt and to
understand and appreciate

00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:08.070
what you're building.

00:44:08.070 --> 00:44:10.720
And there's such a big push
now for STEM and for all

00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:13.715
of these science and math
based educational initiatives,

00:44:13.715 --> 00:44:15.720
but it would be really
interesting to also push

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:17.820
stories because
without those stories,

00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:21.820
how do you get people to
appreciate technology?

00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:23.380
IRA GLASS: I guess.

00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:26.305
I mean, stories are also an
end in and of themselves,

00:44:26.305 --> 00:44:27.325
I would say, but yeah.

00:44:27.325 --> 00:44:29.700
FEMALE SPEAKER: No, I'm saying
if you have to justify it.

00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:32.130
But yes, I think it's an
interesting point that we're

00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:34.340
taught to write in
this very basic way

00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:36.720
and there's a lot
more art to it.

00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:38.100
IRA GLASS: Yeah.

00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:41.460
Though I also think you can
learn to be a good writer.

00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:43.450
I was a bad writer.

00:44:43.450 --> 00:44:51.180
I was bad, actively bad, and
I willed myself to get better

00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:52.690
and really tried
to learn, what are

00:44:52.690 --> 00:44:54.080
the building blocks of a story?

00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:57.582
And I think often people who
aren't naturally good writers,

00:44:57.582 --> 00:44:59.040
you're just
intimidated because you

00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:01.206
feel like, again, you have
to be touched by an angel

00:45:01.206 --> 00:45:03.310
to be a good
writer, but you just

00:45:03.310 --> 00:45:05.580
have to have taste about
what's interesting, I think.

00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:06.820
FEMALE SPEAKER: So what's
your advice for someone

00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:08.620
who wants to become
a better storyteller?

00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:09.820
IRA GLASS: Just start.

00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:10.820
Start making it.

00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:13.240
Don't wait.

00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:14.545
Just start making stuff.

00:45:14.545 --> 00:45:15.420
FEMALE SPEAKER: Cool.

00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:18.410
So now we'd like to open it up
to questions from the audience,

00:45:18.410 --> 00:45:19.910
so there's a
microphone right there.

00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:20.451
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:45:20.451 --> 00:45:21.700
Thanks for coming.

00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:23.590
I wand to follow
up on a question

00:45:23.590 --> 00:45:26.837
that Logan posed earlier, and
I thought you addressed more

00:45:26.837 --> 00:45:28.170
from the technology perspective.

00:45:28.170 --> 00:45:30.144
But she had asked how
technology has changed

00:45:30.144 --> 00:45:31.560
the making of the
show in the time

00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:33.435
that you've been working
on it, and generally

00:45:33.435 --> 00:45:35.020
since you've been
working in radio.

00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:37.019
And not just from the
technological perspective,

00:45:37.019 --> 00:45:39.374
but I guess from the idea
perspective, how has-- I'm

00:45:39.374 --> 00:45:41.540
thinking about your comment
about all the 500 things

00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:43.240
that are distracting
you and keeping you

00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:45.110
from focusing on certain things.

00:45:45.110 --> 00:45:48.650
Does technology or that ability
to have that distraction

00:45:48.650 --> 00:45:50.120
take away the idle
moments that you

00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:52.720
might have had to brainstorm
or think about something,

00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:56.940
and do you have self imposed
free time from technology

00:45:56.940 --> 00:45:59.290
to help cope with that,
if that's a problem?

00:45:59.290 --> 00:46:01.290
IRA GLASS: That's a really
interesting question.

00:46:01.290 --> 00:46:02.630
No, not for me.

00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:06.670
My day is pretty much jam packed
with things that I organized

00:46:06.670 --> 00:46:09.380
for myself and obligations
that I accidentally

00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:13.142
created for myself, and things
that I thought, oh, that would

00:46:13.142 --> 00:46:15.350
be a really fun little
project, and then of course it

00:46:15.350 --> 00:46:17.510
ends up consuming
90 hours a week.

00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:24.480
I don't have the problem
where I feel like, oh, I'm

00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:27.510
so distracted by my devices
or anything like that.

00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:28.870
I don't have that.

00:46:28.870 --> 00:46:30.320
I don't have that at all.

00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:32.320
And I also don't believe
that people's attention

00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:33.403
spans are getting shorter.

00:46:33.403 --> 00:46:35.877
I think it's such
fucking horseshit.

00:46:35.877 --> 00:46:37.210
I just think it's the stupidest.

00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:45.200
I feel like the
success of "Radiolab,"

00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:49.260
and shows like ours, and the
fact that you can get people

00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:54.700
who are 14 years old to listen
to an hour long podcast,

00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:56.794
and there's tons of them.

00:46:56.794 --> 00:46:58.460
People will pay
attention if something's

00:46:58.460 --> 00:46:59.293
kind of interesting.

00:47:01.107 --> 00:47:03.440
AUDIENCE: Would you characterize
yourself and the people

00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:06.070
on your staff as people who are
constantly checking your phones

00:47:06.070 --> 00:47:07.900
and looking at your devices?

00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:09.730
IRA GLASS: No, I would not.

00:47:09.730 --> 00:47:12.126
I mean, maybe-- Seth, would
you characterize the people

00:47:12.126 --> 00:47:13.750
on our staff as
people-- no, we're not.

00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:14.290
No.

00:47:14.290 --> 00:47:17.220
We work in an office where
we have a computer in front

00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:19.320
of us all day long,
so there's no reason

00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:24.810
to check a phone for
anything, and we're old.

00:47:27.370 --> 00:47:29.397
People are in their 30s and 40s.

00:47:29.397 --> 00:47:30.230
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:31.070
IRA GLASS: Sure.

00:47:31.070 --> 00:47:31.611
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:47:31.611 --> 00:47:34.340
So one of my favorite shows
is the "Harper High School"

00:47:34.340 --> 00:47:35.939
episode of "This American Life."

00:47:35.939 --> 00:47:38.480
I actually used to be a teacher
on the south side of Chicago.

00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:42.212
It was along the
lines of what you

00:47:42.212 --> 00:47:43.420
were talking about with the--

00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:44.570
IRA GLASS: Which
school were you?

00:47:44.570 --> 00:47:45.945
AUDIENCE: The
elementary school I

00:47:45.945 --> 00:47:47.310
taught at was Howe Elementary.

00:47:47.310 --> 00:47:48.601
It's actually on the west side.

00:47:48.601 --> 00:47:52.477
But I also taught in Altgeld
Gardens at Fenger High School.

00:47:52.477 --> 00:47:54.310
IRA GLASS: You taught
at Fenger High School?

00:47:54.310 --> 00:47:55.160
AUDIENCE: That was very brief--

00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:57.284
IRA GLASS: Were you there
when that kid got killed?

00:47:57.284 --> 00:47:59.510
AUDIENCE: So for people
who don't remember,

00:47:59.510 --> 00:48:02.110
this was the kid who was beat
to death with a two by four

00:48:02.110 --> 00:48:03.570
and it was captured on video.

00:48:03.570 --> 00:48:05.460
This was in the Altgeld
Gardens neighborhood

00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:08.650
in Chicago, which is a very
dangerous and isolated place

00:48:08.650 --> 00:48:10.896
of violence and
poverty and depression,

00:48:10.896 --> 00:48:13.270
and so I taught there several
months after that happened.

00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:15.103
I was about there or
four months after that.

00:48:15.103 --> 00:48:19.510
And so that personally was a
deeply affecting episode to me.

00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:21.659
And even with the
discussion of what

00:48:21.659 --> 00:48:23.950
we were talking about today,
about what can we possibly

00:48:23.950 --> 00:48:25.510
do upon hearing that?

00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:27.150
As a journalist,
if you're reading

00:48:27.150 --> 00:48:28.816
about this in a
newspaper, the newspaper

00:48:28.816 --> 00:48:32.225
is obligated to present
a balanced, neutral view

00:48:32.225 --> 00:48:34.730
of what's going on.

00:48:34.730 --> 00:48:37.260
It's not hopeful or it's
not depressing, it's just,

00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:38.550
this is what's happening.

00:48:38.550 --> 00:48:41.230
So with your
platform, do you feel

00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:44.750
compelled to end the story
in a certain hopeful tone,

00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:48.680
or as bleak as it really is,
or do you feel some obligation

00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:50.180
to present it in a
way that you feel

00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:52.470
is the best way to present
it to the audience?

00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:55.370
And then as a second
part of the question,

00:48:55.370 --> 00:49:00.430
with the advent of podcasting
and so on and so forth,

00:49:00.430 --> 00:49:02.700
with the amount of probably
interviews that you guys

00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:04.830
did for the story, do
you guys feel maybe

00:49:04.830 --> 00:49:07.275
that there's opportunity to
just place those on there

00:49:07.275 --> 00:49:09.250
and have people draw
their own conclusions?

00:49:09.250 --> 00:49:10.334
We had an hour long story.

00:49:10.334 --> 00:49:12.166
We could only fit so
much in, but here's all

00:49:12.166 --> 00:49:13.830
this other stuff
that we collected.

00:49:13.830 --> 00:49:15.030
Maybe if you go through
and listen to it,

00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:16.446
you can draw your
own conclusions.

00:49:16.446 --> 00:49:18.820
Have you guys given
thought to that?

00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:21.210
IRA GLASS: To the second
thing, absolutely not, no.

00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:27.770
Partly because just
hearing raw interviews

00:49:27.770 --> 00:49:31.650
without the context of, who is
this kid that's explaining what

00:49:31.650 --> 00:49:34.690
is going on, just
feels like it's not

00:49:34.690 --> 00:49:36.510
doing the kids justice.

00:49:36.510 --> 00:49:39.380
And I feel like in the
shows that we're doing,

00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:44.430
we're trying to present it in
as compelling a way as possible

00:49:44.430 --> 00:49:46.742
and let people have their
own thoughts about it.

00:49:46.742 --> 00:49:48.450
I don't feel like
we're trying to preach,

00:49:48.450 --> 00:49:50.856
here's what you should
think about this.

00:49:50.856 --> 00:49:52.230
If anything,
"Harper High School"

00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:54.519
is an example of most
people have no idea

00:49:54.519 --> 00:49:56.310
what it's like in a
neighborhood like that.

00:49:56.310 --> 00:49:58.393
Most people don't live in
neighborhoods like that.

00:49:58.393 --> 00:50:00.706
And to even get
across, here's what

00:50:00.706 --> 00:50:02.080
this feels like,
here's what this

00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:05.800
is in a way that's
three dimensional,

00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:07.784
that in itself, we felt
like that was going

00:50:07.784 --> 00:50:09.450
to be the new thing
we were going to do,

00:50:09.450 --> 00:50:12.395
and we didn't have to
prescribe anything.

00:50:12.395 --> 00:50:13.770
And truthfully,
like I was saying

00:50:13.770 --> 00:50:16.229
before, I don't
know-- if somebody's

00:50:16.229 --> 00:50:18.020
got some suggestions,
you know what I mean?

00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:19.540
We would say to
the principal, what

00:50:19.540 --> 00:50:22.520
do you guys-- we have a
whole section of the story

00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:25.895
on the money problems the school
has, and they were getting

00:50:25.895 --> 00:50:28.520
some extra money for a while and
that money was all going away.

00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:29.950
And it looked
like, in fact, they

00:50:29.950 --> 00:50:31.783
were going to be having
to let go of the two

00:50:31.783 --> 00:50:35.380
social workers in the school
because of budget cuts.

00:50:38.610 --> 00:50:42.681
And now that school
got so much attention,

00:50:42.681 --> 00:50:44.430
Michelle Obama's been
there and those kids

00:50:44.430 --> 00:50:46.454
have gone to the White House.

00:50:46.454 --> 00:50:48.370
There's a lot of attention
on that one school,

00:50:48.370 --> 00:50:51.780
but of course, Fenger
is just as bad still.

00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:54.605
And Fenger is being run by an
incredibly wonderful principal.

00:50:57.680 --> 00:50:59.360
People are trying to
fix these schools.

00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:05.250
It's not like--
so anyway, no, we

00:51:05.250 --> 00:51:08.210
wouldn't put up the other
material on the web.

00:51:08.210 --> 00:51:10.350
And then do we
feel an obligation?

00:51:10.350 --> 00:51:12.300
I feel like yes, we
go into those shows

00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:14.160
with a real missionary sense.

00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:16.214
I mean, that's true of
a lot of things we do.

00:51:16.214 --> 00:51:17.630
I mean, some of
the stories we do,

00:51:17.630 --> 00:51:19.730
we just do for fun,
like the seven things

00:51:19.730 --> 00:51:22.629
that Sarah's mom doesn't think
you should ever talk about.

00:51:22.629 --> 00:51:24.920
We don't really want to rid
the world of people talking

00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:26.570
about what route
they took to dinner.

00:51:26.570 --> 00:51:27.550
We don't care.

00:51:27.550 --> 00:51:28.950
It just seemed funny.

00:51:28.950 --> 00:51:33.420
But something like Harper
or the story with a judge.

00:51:33.420 --> 00:51:37.190
Honestly, probably a
third of everything we do,

00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:42.630
why be a broadcaster if you
don't have the feeling of,

00:51:42.630 --> 00:51:46.230
somebody should talk about
this, and let's talk about it.

00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:48.210
But are you expressing
a dissatisfaction

00:51:48.210 --> 00:51:50.890
with where it went, because
if you are, that's OK?

00:51:50.890 --> 00:51:53.060
AUDIENCE: No, no.

00:51:53.060 --> 00:51:54.740
I actually was one
of the kids that you

00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:56.990
discuss who was sort
of grandfathered

00:51:56.990 --> 00:51:59.390
into-- I was suspended
twice from my middle school

00:51:59.390 --> 00:52:00.400
for being "in a gang."

00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:01.983
It was really just
a group of friends,

00:52:01.983 --> 00:52:04.310
but we engaged in
gang-like activity

00:52:04.310 --> 00:52:06.200
where we got together
and beat people up.

00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:08.640
That was considered
gang activity and stuff.

00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:11.130
And so in the segment
on the Straight Legs

00:52:11.130 --> 00:52:13.510
where they talk about kids,
as soon as they hit 15,

00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:16.000
if you're not in a gang,
you either need to find one

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:17.620
or they'll find one for you.

00:52:17.620 --> 00:52:24.310
So even if I had any
sort of critical thoughts

00:52:24.310 --> 00:52:26.510
about the way that the
story was presented,

00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:28.250
the fact that the
story was being told

00:52:28.250 --> 00:52:31.210
was more than enough for
me, because that was so far

00:52:31.210 --> 00:52:34.662
beyond what most cursory
glances at the issue were doing.

00:52:34.662 --> 00:52:36.120
So that's why I
appreciate the show

00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:39.005
because as they said
in "The OC" segment,

00:52:39.005 --> 00:52:43.500
it's making ordinary
lives seem amazing.

00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:46.220
And it might be told from the
hipster elitist perspective,

00:52:46.220 --> 00:52:51.950
but at least somebody
is telling it.

00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:55.430
So that alone, that is
considered progress,

00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:56.250
then so be it.

00:52:56.250 --> 00:52:58.519
You sort of just have
to take what's given.

00:52:58.519 --> 00:53:00.310
So I appreciate the
work that you're doing,

00:53:00.310 --> 00:53:01.336
and please keep it up.

00:53:01.336 --> 00:53:02.824
IRA GLASS: Thanks.

00:53:02.824 --> 00:53:08.249
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:08.249 --> 00:53:08.790
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:53:08.790 --> 00:53:12.806
So do you go to
the gym every day?

00:53:12.806 --> 00:53:15.460
That wasn't supposed
to be funny.

00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:18.085
What do you listen
to, if anything?

00:53:18.085 --> 00:53:20.460
IRA GLASS: It's funny because
I can't listen to podcasts.

00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:22.900
I used to listen to
Terry Gross, but I

00:53:22.900 --> 00:53:26.680
feel like actually, I have
to have music playing.

00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:31.500
And so lately, I've been
listening to my nephew's band

00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:32.115
Heart Sounds.

00:53:35.015 --> 00:53:41.090
I just started listening to
Taylor Swift and Katy Perry,

00:53:41.090 --> 00:53:47.960
and "What Does the Fox Say."

00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:49.470
I want to add to
my public speech

00:53:49.470 --> 00:53:51.160
a whole fact check
about what does

00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:55.030
the fox say, because it
doesn't say that song-- it's

00:53:55.030 --> 00:53:56.860
totally inaccurate, that song.

00:53:56.860 --> 00:54:01.779
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:01.779 --> 00:54:03.320
AUDIENCE: My question
is more similar

00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:06.690
to the previous question, which
is that a lot of your episodes

00:54:06.690 --> 00:54:10.652
seem to end on a
sobering or sad note.

00:54:10.652 --> 00:54:12.110
I understand that
you said you want

00:54:12.110 --> 00:54:14.485
to tell a surprising story
with strong characters,

00:54:14.485 --> 00:54:17.380
but you also mentioned
earlier that journalists

00:54:17.380 --> 00:54:20.231
can't do anything, and
that it's hopeless.

00:54:20.231 --> 00:54:21.730
IRA GLASS: No, no,
wait, wait, wait.

00:54:21.730 --> 00:54:22.675
You're overstating.

00:54:22.675 --> 00:54:26.850
It's more like it's rare for
you to see direct consequences

00:54:26.850 --> 00:54:30.530
in the world of having
put a story out there.

00:54:30.530 --> 00:54:32.690
It's rare.

00:54:32.690 --> 00:54:34.770
AUDIENCE: But for
the Harper School,

00:54:34.770 --> 00:54:37.240
for instance, you said, what
can you do to change this?

00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:39.198
IRA GLASS: Well that's
something-- right, you'd

00:54:39.198 --> 00:54:42.290
have to change the economic
structure of poor neighborhoods

00:54:42.290 --> 00:54:45.460
in Chicago to change
that fundamentally,

00:54:45.460 --> 00:54:49.020
which is beyond
most people's power.

00:54:49.020 --> 00:54:53.790
Perhaps if one ran a big,
multimillion dollar company,

00:54:53.790 --> 00:54:55.670
whatever.

00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:59.100
AUDIENCE: I wish I ran a
multimillion dollar company.

00:54:59.100 --> 00:55:01.820
So what would you say is the
purpose of the show, then?

00:55:01.820 --> 00:55:04.829
Is it to effect a change,
or is it for entertainment?

00:55:04.829 --> 00:55:07.120
If you admit that most people
who are listening to this

00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:10.710
will drink their coffee, say,
hm, OK, and can't do anything

00:55:10.710 --> 00:55:14.190
about it, why do you do it?

00:55:14.190 --> 00:55:16.190
IRA GLASS: I think the
show is an entertainment.

00:55:16.190 --> 00:55:19.290
I think it's an entertainment.

00:55:19.290 --> 00:55:22.205
I think that one
of the things that

00:55:22.205 --> 00:55:24.330
was part of the idea of
the show from the beginning

00:55:24.330 --> 00:55:25.970
is that you could do
journalism and you

00:55:25.970 --> 00:55:27.780
could do public
broadcasting that

00:55:27.780 --> 00:55:30.910
would have all the ideals
of the very best journalism,

00:55:30.910 --> 00:55:34.670
but also be fundamentally an
entertainment, that you would

00:55:34.670 --> 00:55:36.754
listen because you're
feelings would get caught up

00:55:36.754 --> 00:55:38.461
and you'd get caught
up in the characters

00:55:38.461 --> 00:55:39.389
and things like that.

00:55:39.389 --> 00:55:41.680
I and the staff, we think of
the show as entertainment.

00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:44.275
We think of it as we are
in it to amuse ourselves,

00:55:44.275 --> 00:55:45.650
but because of
the kind of people

00:55:45.650 --> 00:55:47.380
we are, that sort
of amusement also

00:55:47.380 --> 00:55:50.930
involves-- we're interested
in things in the world

00:55:50.930 --> 00:55:54.820
and we want to know what's going
on a neighborhood like West

00:55:54.820 --> 00:55:57.080
Englewood.

00:55:57.080 --> 00:56:00.470
But if we go into
West Englewood,

00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:04.860
we're not trying to do it a sad
sacky kind of sad, corny way.

00:56:07.790 --> 00:56:11.430
We want to be engaged in the
people and the characters.

00:56:11.430 --> 00:56:13.090
I don't know.

00:56:13.090 --> 00:56:14.850
The show is an
entertainment, and I

00:56:14.850 --> 00:56:16.540
feel like to
pretend that there's

00:56:16.540 --> 00:56:21.380
something else about
it, I feel like it's

00:56:21.380 --> 00:56:23.220
enough to be an entertainment.

00:56:23.220 --> 00:56:26.480
Most things that try to be an
entertainment don't succeed.

00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:30.720
Simply to achieve that is hard.

00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:32.179
AUDIENCE: OK, thank you.

00:56:32.179 --> 00:56:32.720
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:33.890
Thanks for being here.

00:56:33.890 --> 00:56:37.030
My question is, do you think
that besides location, there's

00:56:37.030 --> 00:56:40.165
anything distinctly American
about the stories you tell?

00:56:40.165 --> 00:56:41.540
And also, do you
know if you have

00:56:41.540 --> 00:56:43.130
listeners who are non-American?

00:56:43.130 --> 00:56:45.630
IRA GLASS: We do know we have
listeners who are non-American

00:56:45.630 --> 00:56:47.020
because we have podcast numbers.

00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:49.810
Seth, how much of our
audience is overseas?

00:56:49.810 --> 00:56:51.310
Do you have a
microphone back there?

00:56:51.310 --> 00:56:53.860
SETH LIND: Yeah.

00:56:53.860 --> 00:56:56.190
About 10% to 15%.

00:56:56.190 --> 00:56:58.319
IRA GLASS: OK.

00:56:58.319 --> 00:57:00.610
And do I think of the stories
as particularly American?

00:57:00.610 --> 00:57:02.440
I think that the
things in the stories,

00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:04.023
generally if the
stories are any good,

00:57:04.023 --> 00:57:07.070
there's a universal quality to
them that could be anywhere.

00:57:07.070 --> 00:57:09.090
But also, we happen
to be Americans.

00:57:09.090 --> 00:57:10.560
Our tastes are
American, the things

00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:11.810
that interest us are American.

00:57:11.810 --> 00:57:14.850
So I feel like it's kind of
both things at the same time.

00:57:14.850 --> 00:57:18.040
AUDIENCE: You recently
rebroadcasted an updated

00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:20.400
version of an older episode
that I really loved,

00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:21.435
the "Fiasco" episode.

00:57:21.435 --> 00:57:22.060
IRA GLASS: Yes.

00:57:22.060 --> 00:57:22.960
AUDIENCE: And one
of the segments

00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:25.070
in the "Fiasco" episode
is a reporter talking

00:57:25.070 --> 00:57:28.610
about her fiasco interview,
and I was really curious

00:57:28.610 --> 00:57:31.260
if you ever had an
interview or an experience

00:57:31.260 --> 00:57:34.330
producing the show that you
would describe as a fiasco,

00:57:34.330 --> 00:57:35.855
and if so, what was it?

00:57:35.855 --> 00:57:37.230
IRA GLASS: I
haven't had anything

00:57:37.230 --> 00:57:39.850
as spectacular as that reporter
who, in the middle of a very

00:57:39.850 --> 00:57:42.520
tense interview, squirted
coffee or iced tea

00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:46.530
or something out of her
nose, bringing her interview

00:57:46.530 --> 00:57:52.110
to a stop and simultaneously
winning over the interviewee.

00:57:52.110 --> 00:57:55.040
So I don't have as dramatic
a story as that to tell.

00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:57.740
A lot of things have gone really
badly for me in interviews.

00:57:57.740 --> 00:58:00.200
When you do a lot of interviews,
you make every mistake.

00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:02.320
But I don't have
an answer that's

00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:03.570
to the level of your question.

00:58:03.570 --> 00:58:05.319
AUDIENCE: Anything
particularly noteworthy

00:58:05.319 --> 00:58:07.520
that's not at the level
of that kind of a fiasco?

00:58:11.155 --> 00:58:12.030
It's OK if you don't.

00:58:12.030 --> 00:58:12.780
IRA GLASS: Nothing
comes to mind.

00:58:12.780 --> 00:58:14.750
It's a really good question,
but I don't have an answer.

00:58:14.750 --> 00:58:15.291
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:58:15.291 --> 00:58:15.956
Well, thanks.

00:58:15.956 --> 00:58:18.330
IRA GLASS: Which is honestly
a real interviewing problem.

00:58:18.330 --> 00:58:20.040
Often, the question is
better than any answer

00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:21.498
that the interviewee
comes up with.

00:58:21.498 --> 00:58:24.180
So my heart goes out to
you in your excellence

00:58:24.180 --> 00:58:27.491
and in my failure to rise to
the excellence of your question.

00:58:27.491 --> 00:58:27.990
Yes?

00:58:27.990 --> 00:58:29.025
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:58:29.025 --> 00:58:29.900
I have two questions.

00:58:29.900 --> 00:58:34.340
Do you have any dream episodes
or goals for the next 10 years

00:58:34.340 --> 00:58:35.140
for the show?

00:58:35.140 --> 00:58:38.450
And then also, I was listening
to the "Superhero" episode--

00:58:38.450 --> 00:58:40.930
IRA GLASS: Let me
answer that one first.

00:58:40.930 --> 00:58:43.390
I'm constantly having dream
episodes and ideas for things

00:58:43.390 --> 00:58:45.860
we want to do, but
then we do them.

00:58:45.860 --> 00:58:50.430
It's kind of a rolling project.

00:58:50.430 --> 00:58:55.670
Let me think if there's anything
in particular right this day.

00:58:55.670 --> 00:58:57.440
No, nothing today.

00:58:57.440 --> 00:58:59.441
I feel like the stuff
that we want to do, we do,

00:58:59.441 --> 00:59:00.940
but I don't have
anything right now.

00:59:00.940 --> 00:59:01.570
What else?

00:59:01.570 --> 00:59:04.028
AUDIENCE: And then after the
"Superhero" episode, would you

00:59:04.028 --> 00:59:05.620
choose flight or
invisibility and why?

00:59:05.620 --> 00:59:07.703
IRA GLASS: I absolutely
would choose invisibility.

00:59:07.703 --> 00:59:10.630
I know myself very
well, and the kind

00:59:10.630 --> 00:59:14.430
of crouching, lurking,
nobody can see me,

00:59:14.430 --> 00:59:16.420
I will watch you
sort of situation,

00:59:16.420 --> 00:59:18.730
I'm totally comfortable with.

00:59:18.730 --> 00:59:19.370
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:59:19.370 --> 00:59:21.475
IRA GLASS: Flying
from place to place,

00:59:21.475 --> 00:59:24.420
I can buy a ticket
on an airplane.

00:59:24.420 --> 00:59:26.290
AUDIENCE: Airplanes
are so terrible.

00:59:26.290 --> 00:59:27.040
IRA GLASS: Really?

00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:27.540
No.

00:59:27.540 --> 00:59:28.930
I don't feel that way at all.

00:59:28.930 --> 00:59:30.250
AUDIENCE: Have you ever
had a really good story

00:59:30.250 --> 00:59:30.875
on an airplane?

00:59:33.260 --> 00:59:35.150
IRA GLASS: No, because
any really good story

00:59:35.150 --> 00:59:37.072
would involve near
death whatever.

00:59:37.072 --> 00:59:38.530
I'm happy to keep
it the way it is.

00:59:38.530 --> 00:59:40.430
No, airplanes are amazing.

00:59:40.430 --> 00:59:42.555
I can't believe you're
complaining about airplanes.

00:59:42.555 --> 00:59:45.130
That's a technology which
is totally wonderful.

00:59:45.130 --> 00:59:48.617
You get on an object that
moves you really fast,

00:59:48.617 --> 00:59:50.200
and it's super
comfortable, and nobody

00:59:50.200 --> 00:59:53.020
can reach you on
the phone so far.

00:59:53.020 --> 00:59:53.810
It's awesome.

00:59:53.810 --> 00:59:56.079
Every part of it is great.

00:59:56.079 --> 00:59:57.620
AUDIENCE: You must
be in first class.

00:59:57.620 --> 00:59:58.230
IRA GLASS: What?

00:59:58.230 --> 00:59:59.770
AUDIENCE: You must
be in first class.

00:59:59.770 --> 01:00:00.060
IRA GLASS: No.

01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:01.300
I am so not in first class.

01:00:04.375 --> 01:00:05.671
Are you kidding?

01:00:05.671 --> 01:00:06.170
No.

01:00:06.170 --> 01:00:08.990
I spilled coffee in the car
on the way over here and I

01:00:08.990 --> 01:00:11.960
didn't-- that's the
level that I'm at.

01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:15.039
No, no, no, no.

01:00:15.039 --> 01:00:16.080
I can tell you one thing.

01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:18.960
We are talking about
starting another podcast.

01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:22.117
That's one dream for the
show, is that a bunch of us

01:00:22.117 --> 01:00:23.950
feel like we should
start making more stuff,

01:00:23.950 --> 01:00:25.210
and hopefully in
the next year, we'll

01:00:25.210 --> 01:00:26.584
be coming out with
more podcasts.

01:00:26.584 --> 01:00:29.280
And one idea that we're
really excited about

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:31.510
is the idea that we would
do a show that's exactly

01:00:31.510 --> 01:00:34.210
the opposite of our show
and do it as a podcast,

01:00:34.210 --> 01:00:36.297
and instead of it being
each week we choose

01:00:36.297 --> 01:00:38.880
a different theme, we would do
the thing that journalism never

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:40.470
does, and every week,
we would go back

01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:43.840
to exactly the same story and
give you the next chapter of it

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:45.250
and let it unfold over time.

01:00:45.250 --> 01:00:46.750
And so we're hoping
to roll that out

01:00:46.750 --> 01:00:50.156
in January if all
goes as planned.

01:00:50.156 --> 01:00:52.530
We just started talking about
it in the last week or two,

01:00:52.530 --> 01:00:53.946
so maybe it's not
going to happen,

01:00:53.946 --> 01:00:56.370
but I feel like it would
be really exciting,

01:00:56.370 --> 01:01:00.251
and hopefully the first
of other projects.

01:01:00.251 --> 01:01:02.250
AUDIENCE: That leads
perfectly into my question.

01:01:02.250 --> 01:01:03.920
The first "This
American Life" episode

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:06.640
I remember listening to on
the radio in high school

01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:08.370
was about undocumented
immigrants

01:01:08.370 --> 01:01:11.530
who got caught up in jail
for some minor offense

01:01:11.530 --> 01:01:14.220
and then were never able to
get out because they didn't

01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:16.490
have proper documentation.

01:01:16.490 --> 01:01:18.740
I always wonder when I
listen to these stories, what

01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:20.820
happens to these people
five, ten years down

01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:24.510
the road, or even a couple
months, in some cases.

01:01:24.510 --> 01:01:26.600
You just mentioned you
might start a podcast where

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:29.740
you follow up with the people
in your previous stories.

01:01:29.740 --> 01:01:32.750
I'm sure that
manpower is a factor.

01:01:32.750 --> 01:01:35.400
You only have so many
editors and producers.

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:39.670
Have you ever thought of maybe
tapping into your audience base

01:01:39.670 --> 01:01:43.080
and having maybe
grassroots reporters follow

01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:46.870
up on these stories to
give you more manpower to?

01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:48.430
IRA GLASS: No, we haven't.

01:01:48.430 --> 01:01:50.730
No, because generally,
I feel like it's rare

01:01:50.730 --> 01:01:52.980
for there to be a story like
that where there's people

01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:54.230
sitting in prison
at the end of it

01:01:54.230 --> 01:01:55.690
and you wonder, when are
they going to get out?

01:01:55.690 --> 01:01:56.648
What's going to happen?

01:01:56.648 --> 01:01:59.910
Generally, the stories end.

01:01:59.910 --> 01:02:02.160
In a very bratty way, I feel
like there's nothing else

01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:06.595
to say, and that's
the end of the story.

01:02:06.595 --> 01:02:07.470
You know what I mean?

01:02:07.470 --> 01:02:08.844
AUDIENCE: Do your
other producers

01:02:08.844 --> 01:02:10.250
and writers feel the same way?

01:02:10.250 --> 01:02:11.542
They feel like, OK, we're done.

01:02:11.542 --> 01:02:12.916
IRA GLASS: I
haven't polled them.

01:02:12.916 --> 01:02:14.017
I don't know.

01:02:14.017 --> 01:02:15.350
Maybe they do, maybe they don't.

01:02:15.350 --> 01:02:18.110
I mean, I can tell you that
when we do reruns, we do go back

01:02:18.110 --> 01:02:20.500
and we check with all the
characters in the stories.

01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:23.050
And we do that because
we made the mistake once

01:02:23.050 --> 01:02:25.720
of rerunning this story
about this couple,

01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:27.940
and then it turned out
one of them had died,

01:02:27.940 --> 01:02:30.730
and we were just like, oh no.

01:02:30.730 --> 01:02:33.167
That was years and years
ago, so now we go back

01:02:33.167 --> 01:02:34.250
and we check on everybody.

01:02:34.250 --> 01:02:37.790
So when we rerun that episode,
if we ever do, we'll go back

01:02:37.790 --> 01:02:39.640
and we'll know what
happened to them.

01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:43.785
But you yourself, if you're
so curious-- their names are

01:02:43.785 --> 01:02:44.410
in the stories.

01:02:44.410 --> 01:02:46.290
You can check it yourself.

01:02:46.290 --> 01:02:48.390
I don't know why I'm
putting this back on you.

01:02:53.692 --> 01:02:55.150
At "The New York
Times," they don't

01:02:55.150 --> 01:02:57.233
go back to everything in
the archive and tell you,

01:02:57.233 --> 01:02:59.440
here's what happened.

01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:01.020
I'm reacting very
defensively, which

01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:02.605
means you're probably right.

01:03:02.605 --> 01:03:05.790
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:05.790 --> 01:03:07.770
Yes?

01:03:07.770 --> 01:03:09.790
AUDIENCE: So what's
your one advice

01:03:09.790 --> 01:03:12.975
for improving
storytelling skills?

01:03:12.975 --> 01:03:14.850
IRA GLASS: Are you trying
to do storytelling?

01:03:14.850 --> 01:03:15.830
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:03:15.830 --> 01:03:17.470
IRA GLASS: In what
kind of context?

01:03:17.470 --> 01:03:19.360
AUDIENCE: Well, I
love storytelling,

01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:22.020
and I think you are the
best I've heard so far,

01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:24.470
so I wanted to get
one advice from you.

01:03:24.470 --> 01:03:25.930
IRA GLASS: See,
but in real life,

01:03:25.930 --> 01:03:27.430
I'm not a great storyteller.

01:03:27.430 --> 01:03:29.325
I'm only really
good on the radio.

01:03:31.860 --> 01:03:34.210
I need production
values for it to work.

01:03:34.210 --> 01:03:36.435
AUDIENCE: So your advice
is production value?

01:03:36.435 --> 01:03:38.235
IRA GLASS: Absolutely.

01:03:38.235 --> 01:03:40.100
If you can just get a
little music playing

01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:42.040
underneath as you talk.

01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:45.550
I mean, are you talking
about storytelling

01:03:45.550 --> 01:03:47.410
in your everyday life?

01:03:47.410 --> 01:03:49.080
AUDIENCE: No, more in writing.

01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:50.210
IRA GLASS: In writing.

01:03:50.210 --> 01:03:56.745
I mean, honestly, obviously,
the most important part

01:03:56.745 --> 01:03:57.995
is you want to amuse yourself.

01:04:02.530 --> 01:04:05.346
The storytelling we do,
I feel like if you're

01:04:05.346 --> 01:04:07.720
showing your stuff to friends
and they're honest with you

01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:09.680
about what's working
and what isn't,

01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:12.010
obviously, that's a huge help.

01:04:12.010 --> 01:04:13.830
I don't think I have
super smart tips

01:04:13.830 --> 01:04:15.830
that I can impart in a second.

01:04:15.830 --> 01:04:17.407
The things that
I'm interested in

01:04:17.407 --> 01:04:18.990
do have the kind of
structure that I'm

01:04:18.990 --> 01:04:21.210
saying, where it's
very plot based.

01:04:21.210 --> 01:04:24.680
I feel like that just gives
things an enormous power.

01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:26.340
That was a terrible answer.

01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:29.070
I'm so sorry.

01:04:29.070 --> 01:04:32.070
FEMALE SPEAKER:
And on that note--

01:04:32.070 --> 01:04:36.270
[LAUGHTER]

01:04:36.270 --> 01:04:39.429
[APPLAUSE]

01:04:39.429 --> 01:04:40.470
FEMALE SPEAKER: Good job.

01:04:40.470 --> 01:04:41.070
IRA GLASS: Thanks.

01:04:41.070 --> 01:04:41.370
FEMALE SPEAKER: That was fun.

01:04:41.370 --> 01:04:42.270
That was great.

01:04:42.270 --> 01:05:08.312
