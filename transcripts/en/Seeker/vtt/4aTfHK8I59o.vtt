00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.700
Ho ho ho, no. Hey guys, Matt here for Science or Fiction.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.670
Well, it’s that time of year again.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.260
‘Tis the season for seasonal affective disorder.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.120
When millions of people get the gift of being
bummed out and feel like Santa is stuck in

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.179
their emotional chimney.

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.310
Now here’s how seasonal affective disorder works:
Well then why do we feel this way?

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.620
Come on! Guys you gotta tell me what we're going to put in this before we start recording, ok? Thank you.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.640
Seasonal affective disorder or S.A.D., yes
SAD: The idea that our moods may be, at least

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.300
in part, solar powered.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.540
When the weather gets dim, cold, and gloomy,
millions of people start thinking about adding

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.680
antidepressants to their Christmas wish list.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.560
Or maybe they don’t.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.960
Because some publications have claimed that
this seasonal affective thing isn’t

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.560
really a thing at all--that previous studies might have been asking leading questions, or that there could

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.920
have been confirmation bias for S.A.D. among
people, and researchers.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.540
So who’s right?

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.160
Well, these anti-seasonal affective disorder
headlines are referencing a CDC study that

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.580
analyzed over 34,000 American adults’
answers to a depression-related survey.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.980
This analysis did not find correlation between
seasons and increased levels of depression,

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.120
nor did they find greater rates of depression
in higher latitudes at which there’s less

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.720
daylight and more cold--more winter, if you
will.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.140
But there are some problems with this analysis.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.240
In the research claiming S.A.D. is a myth,
they studied phone surveys, which could be

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.280
problem when you think about how depression
can affect people’s social interactions.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.140
In other words, people with seasonal affective
disorder may be less interested in participating

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.280
in a survey concerning their emotional well
being than people who don’t experience S.A.D.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.240
I mean imagine getting a phone call asking how you feel while experiencing depression?

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.640
Probably not as excited to talk as someone
who’s all sunshine and rainbows.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.180
Ugh, you again.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.280
There’s also a lot of stigma around mental
health, so talking to a non-health professional

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.570
in a non-personal phone call may have incentivized
people to lie.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.070
I mean, look, I’ve lied about my TV-viewing
habits in a Nielsen survey because I was embarrassed

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.070
to say that I watch reality TV dance competitions.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.640
That Viennese waltz was so beautiful.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.830
You can't count out the football players.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.640
So, basically, we can’t say for sure that
seasons definitely don’t have mental effects on people.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.120
In fact, other studies have shown that seasons
not only affect mood, but can also affect

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.270
your brain and even your genes.

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.360
For example: One group of scientists ran a
study that took on the challenge of studying

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.730
the impact of seasons on our brain while trying
to control for any seasonal or daytime cues.

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.140
That involved days of sleep deprivation, light
deprivation, sound deprivation, and quarantining

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.110
participants away from the outside world for
4.5 days, a task that was then repeated at

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.480
different times of the year.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.040
What the researchers found was that the participants’ brain activity peaked for memory tasks in

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.220
the autumn and tanked in the spring.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.940
And for attention tasks, neurological activity was higher in the summer and lower in the winter.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.460
This despite having all of those summer/winter
cues supposedly controlled for in their creepy

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:58.730
deprivation chamber.

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.240
I’m just assuming it was creepy.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.140
In another study, scientists found that people’s
genes are affected by the changing seasons.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.210
In that research, they saw that the genes
responsible for controlling immunity and inflammation

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:12.000
were more active in colder, winter months.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.860
Our very genetic makeup is affected by seasons!

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.980
Now with all this cool data on how seasons affect our genes and brains, which could be a whole

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.080
other awesome video, we can’t rule out seasons
affecting our mood quite yet.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.240
But if you’re feeling sad at the moment,
maybe try to find ways to relieve it now instead

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.820
of just waiting for spring.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.920
But what about you? Do you think seasonal affective disorder is real?

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.810
Or just a fun way to rename depression for December. You know the way we rename coniferous trees

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:36.810
to Christmas trees?

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.950
Was this a weird way to wish you Merry
Christmas and happy holidays?

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:40.600
Maybe.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.520
But happy holidays?

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.080
You know what gets me into the holiday spirit.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.440
Finding out about the possibility of alien
life.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.640
No really.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.300
Check out this video here to see what I mean.
