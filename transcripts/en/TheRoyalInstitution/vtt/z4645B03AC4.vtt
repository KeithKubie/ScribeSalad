00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.740
These bottle rockets were a really fun
and exciting way that the children can 

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:18.340
do science on the playground.

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.919
Today we are going to do an amazing fantastic scientific experiment. 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.040
This experiment is gonna involve these tablets that you may have seen at home, paracetamol. 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.750
But these are fizzy paracetamol.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.940
When these paracetamol hit the water,

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.489
this is what happens...

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.059
There's a chemical reaction now between the water and the tablets.

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.299
In all of those bubbles is carbon dioxide.

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:05.419
It's a bit like fizzy drinks, all the bubbles have carbon dioxide.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.880
Have any of you seen anything like that before? Yeah...

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.300
Is that fun?

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.310
No.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.220
Okay, so we're going to do something really exciting,

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.740
that wasn't much fun.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.470
I'm gonna fill this half way with water,

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.090
get my jar ready,

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.159
then Michael's going to quickly put those tablets in,

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.799
I'm gonna quickly do up the lid, shake it....

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.220
It's not gonna work...

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.200
Woah! Yes!

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:59.680
You guys are going to test different variations of...

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.440
different sized bottles, how many tablets you're going to use, 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:11.260
and what type of water, because we have hot, warm and cold water.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.080
Whoever's rocket goes the highest

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.000
is gonna win a prize.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.670
These headache tablets contain a
chemical which reacts with water to

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.560
produce carbon dioxide gas.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.170
This gas builds up inside the bottle until
the pressure is enough to pop the lid.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.040
When the lid pops it pushes down on the
bottom of the glass which results in an

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.020
upward push on the bottle,

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.959
a bit like the way you can jump up in the air

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.489
by pushing down on the ground. Once in
the air

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:42.739
the liquid coming out of the bottle pushes
it along in the same way

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.810
as the gas is coming out a real rocket
propels it upwards.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.500
In order for it to fly up

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.200
Do you think there has to be any space
between the lid

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.660
and the bottom of the cup? You think
there has to be space?

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.940
No! We need no space! We need thrust!

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.760
Why does there have to be no space
between the lid and the bottom of the cup?

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.209
We need more thrust!

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.840
Why are you using big bottles?

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.360
Because then it'll go higher.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.520
Because it has more space to fizz up.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.550
One of the things you can investigate
with this activity is how the

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.650
temperature of the water affects the reaction.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.340
As some other children today found out,
the hotter the water, 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.560
the more vigorously the tablets produce the gas.

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:35.060
This is because in hot water got the molecules of chemicals from the tablet

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.120
and the water particles have more energy
and move more quickly.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.280
This means they collide with each other
more often

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.900
which results in more chemical reactions
in a given time.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.480
These bottle rockets are a really
fun and exciting way to introduce your children to science.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.400
if you're interested please go on our website, subscribe for more activities,

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.460
and download the info sheet for this one

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.030
and we look forward to seeing videos and
pictures have you and your children

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.120
doing the same thing.
