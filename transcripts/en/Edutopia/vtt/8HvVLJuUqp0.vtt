00:00:10.136 --> 00:00:14.586
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The Environmental and
Spatial Technology Initiative, EAST,

00:00:14.586 --> 00:00:18.276
is an elective class offered
in schools around the country.

00:00:18.836 --> 00:00:23.176
Students use the latest technology to
complete projects of their own design

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:24.976
that often serve their community.

00:00:24.976 --> 00:00:28.116
&gt;&gt;Sarah: And then we contacted
the people who owned the rights.

00:00:28.256 --> 00:00:31.036
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Emma and Sarah are
eighth graders at Little Rock,

00:00:31.036 --> 00:00:33.236
Arkansas' Horace Mann Middle School.

00:00:33.426 --> 00:00:34.426
&gt;&gt;Teacher: You two look a lot alike.

00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:37.926
&gt;&gt;Narrator: They have produced a
ten-minute historical documentary,

00:00:38.276 --> 00:00:41.786
which is about to be judged in
a national EAST Competition.

00:00:41.936 --> 00:00:44.806
&gt;&gt;Teacher: We'll be showing the
film, and we watch it together,

00:00:44.806 --> 00:00:48.786
and then we'll have a
couple of questions for you.

00:00:50.586 --> 00:00:53.216
&gt;&gt;Emma: Edith and Ms. Monroe are
leaving today in government boats.

00:00:53.506 --> 00:00:56.836
We're going to litter
off [inaudible].

00:00:56.836 --> 00:00:57.886
I went riding yesterday.

00:00:57.886 --> 00:00:58.806
It sure was fun.

00:00:59.256 --> 00:01:00.716
&gt;&gt;Emma: I did most of the editing.

00:01:00.826 --> 00:01:03.246
Sarah was more of the
sidekick on there.

00:01:03.246 --> 00:01:04.346
&gt;&gt;Sarah: Yeah, I am the writer.

00:01:04.556 --> 00:01:05.526
I'm the organizer.

00:01:05.616 --> 00:01:09.026
I don't-- I can edit if I
need to, but I prefer not to.

00:01:09.026 --> 00:01:11.236
I just tell her what to do.

00:01:12.346 --> 00:01:15.626
&gt;&gt;Emma: And there was one paragraph

00:01:15.626 --> 00:01:18.586
that she had the hardest
problem hearing.

00:01:18.586 --> 00:01:19.476
&gt;&gt;Sarah: Most problem hearing.

00:01:19.476 --> 00:01:20.006
&gt;&gt;Emma: No, the hardest.

00:01:20.006 --> 00:01:22.256
&gt;&gt;Emma: When we started making the
movie, I didn't really notice it,

00:01:22.256 --> 00:01:24.206
but now, when I watch a
movie, I suddenly realize,

00:01:24.206 --> 00:01:24.836
"Now, that's a good cut-away.

00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:25.316
That's good editing.

00:01:25.346 --> 00:01:25.976
You know, that's a good sound."

00:01:26.146 --> 00:01:28.406
&gt;&gt;Sarah: For the first time
on record, all the tributaries

00:01:28.406 --> 00:01:30.546
of the Mississippi
flooded at the same time,

00:01:31.046 --> 00:01:32.626
adding to the steady
rise of the water.

00:01:33.746 --> 00:01:35.316
&gt;&gt;Emma: In class, I write a report.

00:01:35.586 --> 00:01:37.286
In EAST, I make a movie.

00:01:37.316 --> 00:01:38.796
I can't remember history.

00:01:38.836 --> 00:01:42.156
I know who some of these people are,
but I can't remember what they did.

00:01:42.156 --> 00:01:44.806
In EAST, I know what I
did, because I did it.

00:01:44.996 --> 00:01:45.636
I made it real.

00:01:45.776 --> 00:01:47.236
&gt;&gt;Deanne: Okay, what
you've just been reading

00:01:47.236 --> 00:01:48.936
about are reformers who've
been opposing slavery.

00:01:49.056 --> 00:01:50.546
&gt;&gt;Emma: I love my history teacher.

00:01:50.546 --> 00:01:52.596
My history teacher's wonderful,

00:01:52.596 --> 00:01:55.066
but she can't give me the
things that EAST can give me.

00:01:55.066 --> 00:01:58.396
She can't give me hands-on
experiences.

00:01:58.596 --> 00:02:00.846
&gt;&gt;Deanne: This is just a
survey course of US History.

00:02:00.846 --> 00:02:02.706
And this is a very structured course.

00:02:03.026 --> 00:02:05.006
The curriculum is set
by state standards.

00:02:05.066 --> 00:02:08.606
It's a problem sometimes when you let
kids just take something that they

00:02:08.606 --> 00:02:09.826
like and they run with it.

00:02:10.206 --> 00:02:12.236
You know, I'm responsible
for making sure

00:02:12.236 --> 00:02:14.136
that they have covered
all of that material.

00:02:14.586 --> 00:02:18.016
And in EAST Lab, she gets to
take whatever she likes, usually,

00:02:18.016 --> 00:02:19.556
and then she can run with it.

00:02:19.556 --> 00:02:21.106
There's much more freedom down there.

00:02:21.536 --> 00:02:23.496
&gt;&gt;Emma: She shows me the
book, and she says, "Read it."

00:02:23.786 --> 00:02:24.236
I read it.

00:02:24.526 --> 00:02:25.606
I fill out a worksheet.

00:02:25.966 --> 00:02:30.346
But here, I actually have to turn
in something more than just paper.

00:02:30.406 --> 00:02:36.156
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Oh, very
cool, sweet, super sweet.

00:02:36.336 --> 00:02:39.316
&gt;&gt;Teacher: How much
interview minutes did you log?

00:02:39.976 --> 00:02:41.866
&gt;&gt;Sarah: Oh, at least
an hour-and-a-half.

00:02:41.866 --> 00:02:42.856
&gt;&gt;Emma: Yeah, at least.

00:02:42.856 --> 00:02:43.876
&gt;&gt;Sarah: Because Mr. Jones...

00:02:43.876 --> 00:02:44.256
&gt;&gt;Teacher: With each person?

00:02:44.256 --> 00:02:44.376
&gt;&gt;Emma: Yes.

00:02:44.526 --> 00:02:45.136
&gt;&gt;Sarah: Well, no.

00:02:45.136 --> 00:02:46.226
&gt;&gt;Emma: A lot of them
were just dribble.

00:02:46.226 --> 00:02:47.626
&gt;&gt;Emma: I felt so proud of myself,

00:02:47.626 --> 00:02:49.816
because I don't know
most of the information.

00:02:49.816 --> 00:02:50.626
It's mostly Sarah.

00:02:50.966 --> 00:02:54.736
But when they started asking,
you know, "How many people died,

00:02:54.736 --> 00:02:56.116
and what was the worst ones?"

00:02:56.426 --> 00:02:59.146
You know, I was like,
"I know that stuff.

00:02:59.396 --> 00:02:59.876
You know, I know it.

00:02:59.876 --> 00:03:00.556
I can tell them."

00:03:00.556 --> 00:03:02.576
&gt;&gt;Sarah: We had something
like a hundred sources.

00:03:02.856 --> 00:03:06.526
&gt;&gt;Emma: Our packet of files that
Sarah highlighted, about this big.

00:03:06.936 --> 00:03:08.256
We have so much information.

00:03:08.386 --> 00:03:11.626
Every person, at least one of them
gave us a picture, or a packet.

00:03:11.806 --> 00:03:13.256
&gt;&gt;Sarah: Well, one of
them gave us the clips.

00:03:13.606 --> 00:03:15.826
&gt;&gt;Emma: Yeah, those wonderful
clips that made our movie.

00:03:15.826 --> 00:03:18.536
&gt;&gt;Sarah: I know that I've
become a better public speaker,

00:03:18.536 --> 00:03:22.286
and I know that I'm more
comfortable around strangers now.

00:03:22.286 --> 00:03:24.976
I'm not so afraid to
show off what I've done.

00:03:25.336 --> 00:03:26.216
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Good job, girls.

00:03:26.216 --> 00:03:26.596
&gt;&gt;Emma: Great.

00:03:26.806 --> 00:03:29.586
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Great job, yeah, good job.

00:03:29.586 --> 00:03:30.106
&gt;&gt;Sarah: Thanks.

00:03:30.626 --> 00:03:31.356
&gt;&gt;Teacher: All right!

00:03:32.196 --> 00:03:34.666
&gt;&gt;Teacher: It was great to
work with these young people.

00:03:34.666 --> 00:03:37.356
We particularly have been so
impressed with the quality

00:03:37.436 --> 00:03:40.686
of the films that are
coming out of the EAST Labs

00:03:40.876 --> 00:03:41.836
from around this country.

00:03:42.326 --> 00:03:48.546
And our winning documentary film
is, "Watching the Waters Rise,"

00:03:49.616 --> 00:03:56.666
Horace Mann Magnet School,
Emma Baylon and Sarah Baylon.

00:03:56.666 --> 00:03:59.866
&gt;&gt;Sarah: We just won the Hot
Springs Documentary Film Festival

00:03:59.866 --> 00:04:00.606
first prize!

00:04:00.736 --> 00:04:00.936
Shock!

00:04:01.056 --> 00:04:01.466
&gt;&gt;Emma: Excited!

00:04:01.466 --> 00:04:01.636
Yes!

00:04:01.636 --> 00:04:05.796
&gt;&gt;Sarah: It's like a bubble!

00:04:05.856 --> 00:04:06.036
&lt;laughs&gt;

00:04:06.036 --> 00:04:06.976
&gt;&gt;Emma: No, yeah, bubble.

00:04:06.976 --> 00:04:07.976
&gt;&gt;Sarah: Yeah, yeah,
that's could work.
