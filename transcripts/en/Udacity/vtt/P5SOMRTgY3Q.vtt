00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.270
Welcome to the class.

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:06.330
We feel this course will be very beneficial for aspiring and

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.170
practicing data scientists in industry and in academia.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.960
&gt;&gt; In this class, we will learn how to build and validate models.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.050
Many of you may have already taken a course in machine learning or

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.269
data science, and may already be familiar with machine learning models.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.840
In this course, we will take a more general approach, walking through

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.760
the questioning, modeling and validation steps of the model-building process.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.030
Now, the goal is to get you to practice thinking in depth about a problem and

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.900
coming up with your own solutions.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.620
Many examples we will attempt may not have a one correct answer, but

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.230
will require you to work through the problem,

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.360
applying the methods that we hope to illustrate throughout this class.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.320
&gt;&gt; It is somewhat like a game of chess.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.040
The rules are quite well-defined, but one needs to have a strategy for winning.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.330
In any given situation, there may be multiple correct moves leading you to

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.770
victory and numerous incorrect ones.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.360
It is to study and practice.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.110
You learn the strategies for winning.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.230
&gt;&gt; At the end of this class, you will feel confident in your ability to

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.860
conquer new problems by applying an iterative process of analysis that takes you

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.770
from a vague initial question to a rigorous model addressing it and

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.330
quantifying the uncertainty that exists in any model.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.530
In addition, you might learn about new types of models to apply to problems, and

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.590
you will learn how to use the best model for

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.400
the task that takes the most advantage of data instead of

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.650
applying one black box model after another and hoping for the best.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.830
But before all of that, let's get to know each other.
