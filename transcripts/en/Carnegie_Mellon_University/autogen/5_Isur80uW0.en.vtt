00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859
are innovating and transforming higher
 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:45.180
are innovating and transforming higher
education innovation is great but

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190
education innovation is great but
 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.979
education innovation is great but
sometimes we have to recognize that our

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989
sometimes we have to recognize that our
 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:50.699
sometimes we have to recognize that our
innovations may or may not work so the

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709
innovations may or may not work so the
 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.800
innovations may or may not work so the
idea of these instrumented classrooms is

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810
idea of these instrumented classrooms is
 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.740
idea of these instrumented classrooms is
to really promote educational innovation

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750
to really promote educational innovation
 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.069
to really promote educational innovation
with iteration so that we can ask our

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079
with iteration so that we can ask our
 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:01.259
with iteration so that we can ask our
colleagues to dream their biggest dreams

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269
colleagues to dream their biggest dreams
 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:03.809
colleagues to dream their biggest dreams
try it out and then we'll help them work

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819
try it out and then we'll help them work
 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:05.759
try it out and then we'll help them work
with them collect data on how students

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769
with them collect data on how students
 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:07.559
with them collect data on how students
are learning how they're engaged how

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569
are learning how they're engaged how
 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:09.119
are learning how they're engaged how
they're transferring what they learned

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:09.129
they're transferring what they learned
 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:11.580
they're transferring what they learned
and what behaviors in the classroom and

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590
and what behaviors in the classroom and
 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.949
and what behaviors in the classroom and
outside are actually contributing to the

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959
outside are actually contributing to the
 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:15.990
outside are actually contributing to the
best for our students and the data that

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000
best for our students and the data that
 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.789
best for our students and the data that
we're collecting in these living labs is

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799
we're collecting in these living labs is
 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.209
we're collecting in these living labs is
a key part of that but that's a focus on

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:21.219
a key part of that but that's a focus on
 

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:24.390
a key part of that but that's a focus on
campus my colleagues and I also are

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400
campus my colleagues and I also are
 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.960
campus my colleagues and I also are
making a big impact in the

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970
making a big impact in the
 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.270
making a big impact in the
unity so maybe Anthony you'd like to

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280
unity so maybe Anthony you'd like to
 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.490
unity so maybe Anthony you'd like to
talk about that sure thanks thanks

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500
talk about that sure thanks thanks
 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.280
talk about that sure thanks thanks
Marcia so a lot of the work that I do is

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290
Marcia so a lot of the work that I do is
 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:34.810
Marcia so a lot of the work that I do is
insert smart and connected communities

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820
insert smart and connected communities
 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.450
insert smart and connected communities
and one of the key challenges to

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460
and one of the key challenges to
 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.130
and one of the key challenges to
enabling smart and connected communities

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140
enabling smart and connected communities
 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.260
enabling smart and connected communities
is making sure that we have easy to use

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270
is making sure that we have easy to use
 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.710
is making sure that we have easy to use
accessible and secure access to sensors

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720
accessible and secure access to sensors
 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.690
accessible and secure access to sensors
and wireless connectivity pervasively

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700
and wireless connectivity pervasively
 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.300
and wireless connectivity pervasively
across an environment and so there's one

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310
across an environment and so there's one
 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:50.980
across an environment and so there's one
thing to be said about designing a

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990
thing to be said about designing a
 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.010
thing to be said about designing a
single sensor that you can build it does

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020
single sensor that you can build it does
 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.690
single sensor that you can build it does
one particular purpose but it's a

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:55.700
one particular purpose but it's a
 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.670
one particular purpose but it's a
totally different beast to actually have

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680
totally different beast to actually have
 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.380
totally different beast to actually have
thousands of these sensors that you

00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.390
thousands of these sensors that you
 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.570
thousands of these sensors that you
distribute across the city that have to

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580
distribute across the city that have to
 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.700
distribute across the city that have to
collect data at scale that push this

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710
collect data at scale that push this
 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.850
collect data at scale that push this
information back to analytics this

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860
information back to analytics this
 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.880
information back to analytics this
basically requires expertise in hardware

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:09.890
basically requires expertise in hardware
 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.520
basically requires expertise in hardware
design wireless communication data

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530
design wireless communication data
 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.180
design wireless communication data
storage analytics driven by AI and

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190
storage analytics driven by AI and
 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:17.860
storage analytics driven by AI and
machine learning these are all things

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870
machine learning these are all things
 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.230
machine learning these are all things
that you find readily available on CMU's

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240
that you find readily available on CMU's
 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.580
that you find readily available on CMU's
campus and so this is an absolutely

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590
campus and so this is an absolutely
 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.620
campus and so this is an absolutely
fantastic environment to be working on

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630
fantastic environment to be working on
 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.170
fantastic environment to be working on
that so one of the projects that I've

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180
that so one of the projects that I've
 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.550
that so one of the projects that I've
been working on is deploying low cost

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560
been working on is deploying low cost
 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.780
been working on is deploying low cost
low-power wide-area sensor networks

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:31.790
low-power wide-area sensor networks
 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.000
low-power wide-area sensor networks
across the community so actually if you

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.010
across the community so actually if you
 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:35.850
across the community so actually if you
go back to the previous slide if you can

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860
go back to the previous slide if you can
 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.070
go back to the previous slide if you can
this is a picture where we've deployed a

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080
this is a picture where we've deployed a
 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.930
this is a picture where we've deployed a
bunch of different gateways that sit on

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940
bunch of different gateways that sit on
 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.000
bunch of different gateways that sit on
top of buildings on campus and the idea

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.010
top of buildings on campus and the idea
 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.909
top of buildings on campus and the idea
is unlike wireless networks like Wi-Fi

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:45.919
is unlike wireless networks like Wi-Fi
 

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:47.290
is unlike wireless networks like Wi-Fi
in a building where you need hundreds of

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:47.300
in a building where you need hundreds of
 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.090
in a building where you need hundreds of
them to cover a building one of these

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:49.100
them to cover a building one of these
 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.670
them to cover a building one of these
devices actually covers a couple of city

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680
devices actually covers a couple of city
 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.070
devices actually covers a couple of city
blocks and instead of supporting you

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080
blocks and instead of supporting you
 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.270
blocks and instead of supporting you
know high data rate things like cell

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280
know high data rate things like cell
 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.100
know high data rate things like cell
phones they're designed for these

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110
phones they're designed for these
 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.440
phones they're designed for these
low-power IOT devices that basically

00:05:59.440 --> 00:05:59.450
low-power IOT devices that basically
 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:01.060
low-power IOT devices that basically
sense information from the environment

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:01.070
sense information from the environment
 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.250
sense information from the environment
and then can push a very low data rate

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:03.260
and then can push a very low data rate
 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.920
and then can push a very low data rate
back to a central thing so the idea is

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:05.930
back to a central thing so the idea is
 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:07.480
back to a central thing so the idea is
that we can use these for a whole bunch

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:07.490
that we can use these for a whole bunch
 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.580
that we can use these for a whole bunch
of different types of applications so

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:09.590
of different types of applications so
 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.100
of different types of applications so
one of the applications picture in the

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:12.110
one of the applications picture in the
 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:14.650
one of the applications picture in the
next slide is looking at predictive and

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:14.660
next slide is looking at predictive and
 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.650
next slide is looking at predictive and
preventative maintenance as well as

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:16.660
preventative maintenance as well as
 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.360
preventative maintenance as well as
monitoring of infrastructure around the

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:19.370
monitoring of infrastructure around the
 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:21.040
monitoring of infrastructure around the
city so this is actually a picture of

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.050
city so this is actually a picture of
 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:23.650
city so this is actually a picture of
the Liberty bridges which a year ago

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:23.660
the Liberty bridges which a year ago
 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:26.170
the Liberty bridges which a year ago
actually caught on fire and so the

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:26.180
actually caught on fire and so the
 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.000
actually caught on fire and so the
question is how can we actually tell if

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:28.010
question is how can we actually tell if
 

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:30.070
question is how can we actually tell if
these bridge structures are safe anymore

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.080
these bridge structures are safe anymore
 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.810
these bridge structures are safe anymore
and so the way people typically do that

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:31.820
and so the way people typically do that
 

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:33.730
and so the way people typically do that
is they go up and they measure specific

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:33.740
is they go up and they measure specific
 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.050
is they go up and they measure specific
points on the bridge and they take spot

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:35.060
points on the bridge and they take spot
 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:36.880
points on the bridge and they take spot
samples and they try to estimate the

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:36.890
samples and they try to estimate the
 

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:37.779
samples and they try to estimate the
structural integrity

00:06:37.779 --> 00:06:37.789
structural integrity
 

00:06:37.789 --> 00:06:39.279
structural integrity
so what some

00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:39.289
so what some
 

00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:40.600
so what some
students assume you are able to do is

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:40.610
students assume you are able to do is
 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:42.639
students assume you are able to do is
actually create sensors that can do this

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:42.649
actually create sensors that can do this
 

00:06:42.649 --> 00:06:44.469
actually create sensors that can do this
continuously over long periods of time

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:44.479
continuously over long periods of time
 

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:46.779
continuously over long periods of time
that are very easy to install and they

00:06:46.779 --> 00:06:46.789
that are very easy to install and they
 

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:48.639
that are very easy to install and they
can communicate back using this wireless

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:48.649
can communicate back using this wireless
 

00:06:48.649 --> 00:06:50.859
can communicate back using this wireless
infrastructure we created another

00:06:50.859 --> 00:06:50.869
infrastructure we created another
 

00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:52.659
infrastructure we created another
example of a project that I've been

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:52.669
example of a project that I've been
 

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:54.760
example of a project that I've been
closely collaborating with professor

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:54.770
closely collaborating with professor
 

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:56.200
closely collaborating with professor
Mario Burgess in the civil engineering

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:56.210
Mario Burgess in the civil engineering
 

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:57.639
Mario Burgess in the civil engineering
department so we can go to the next

00:06:57.639 --> 00:06:57.649
department so we can go to the next
 

00:06:57.649 --> 00:07:01.149
department so we can go to the next
slide is actually on tracking and

00:07:01.149 --> 00:07:01.159
slide is actually on tracking and
 

00:07:01.159 --> 00:07:02.980
slide is actually on tracking and
monitoring the flow of people in and out

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:02.990
monitoring the flow of people in and out
 

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:05.290
monitoring the flow of people in and out
of spaces on campus and so the idea here

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:05.300
of spaces on campus and so the idea here
 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.420
of spaces on campus and so the idea here
is if we can estimate where people are

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:07.430
is if we can estimate where people are
 

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:08.889
is if we can estimate where people are
moving and how they're utilizing the

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:08.899
moving and how they're utilizing the
 

00:07:08.899 --> 00:07:11.200
moving and how they're utilizing the
space we can do things like adjust the

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:11.210
space we can do things like adjust the
 

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:12.969
space we can do things like adjust the
heating and cooling to save energy we

00:07:12.969 --> 00:07:12.979
heating and cooling to save energy we
 

00:07:12.979 --> 00:07:14.679
heating and cooling to save energy we
can increase comfort we can make sure

00:07:14.679 --> 00:07:14.689
can increase comfort we can make sure
 

00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:17.739
can increase comfort we can make sure
that we're utilizing resources another

00:07:17.739 --> 00:07:17.749
that we're utilizing resources another
 

00:07:17.749 --> 00:07:19.420
that we're utilizing resources another

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:19.430
example of a projects that I've been
 

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:21.399
example of a projects that I've been
working on again with Mario is actually

00:07:21.399 --> 00:07:21.409
working on again with Mario is actually
 

00:07:21.409 --> 00:07:24.219
working on again with Mario is actually
on retrofitting old-fashioned electric

00:07:24.219 --> 00:07:24.229
on retrofitting old-fashioned electric
 

00:07:24.229 --> 00:07:25.629
on retrofitting old-fashioned electric
heaters that you might find in

00:07:25.629 --> 00:07:25.639
heaters that you might find in
 

00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:27.820
heaters that you might find in
commercial spaces around campus as well

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:27.830
commercial spaces around campus as well
 

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:30.010
commercial spaces around campus as well
as in residential areas where we can

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:30.020
as in residential areas where we can
 

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:31.600
as in residential areas where we can
make them smarter so they can actually

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:31.610
make them smarter so they can actually
 

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:34.059
make them smarter so they can actually
act as a ballast for the smart grid and

00:07:34.059 --> 00:07:34.069
act as a ballast for the smart grid and
 

00:07:34.069 --> 00:07:35.619
act as a ballast for the smart grid and
again all of this is because we're able

00:07:35.619 --> 00:07:35.629
again all of this is because we're able
 

00:07:35.629 --> 00:07:38.049
again all of this is because we're able
to tie physical information to sensors

00:07:38.049 --> 00:07:38.059
to tie physical information to sensors
 

00:07:38.059 --> 00:07:40.959
to tie physical information to sensors
collect that information process it the

00:07:40.959 --> 00:07:40.969
collect that information process it the
 

00:07:40.969 --> 00:07:42.429
collect that information process it the

in the environment so this is called

00:08:07.659 --> 00:08:07.669
in the environment so this is called
 

00:08:07.669 --> 00:08:09.639
in the environment so this is called
mobile augmented reality and the idea

00:08:09.639 --> 00:08:09.649
mobile augmented reality and the idea
 

00:08:09.649 --> 00:08:11.799
mobile augmented reality and the idea
here is that we could have for example a

00:08:11.799 --> 00:08:11.809
here is that we could have for example a
 

00:08:11.809 --> 00:08:14.619
here is that we could have for example a

imagine you know the slightly less
 

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.239
imagine you know the slightly less
glamorous version of this would be

00:08:19.239 --> 00:08:19.249
glamorous version of this would be
 

00:08:19.249 --> 00:08:20.619
glamorous version of this would be
looking at facility maintenance

00:08:20.619 --> 00:08:20.629
looking at facility maintenance
 

00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:22.239
looking at facility maintenance

really interesting activity that we

00:08:25.629 --> 00:08:25.639
really interesting activity that we
 

00:08:25.639 --> 00:08:27.999
really interesting activity that we
think can leverage all of this highly

00:08:27.999 --> 00:08:28.009
think can leverage all of this highly
 

00:08:28.009 --> 00:08:30.009

panopticon a word that has stuck with us
 

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:11.330
panopticon a word that has stuck with us
till now and this is from 240 years ago

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:11.340
till now and this is from 240 years ago
 

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:14.180
till now and this is from 240 years ago
the idea of a prison in which the center

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:14.190
the idea of a prison in which the center
 

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:16.610
the idea of a prison in which the center
cell where the guards are can view any

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:16.620
cell where the guards are can view any
 

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:18.530
cell where the guards are can view any
cell where the prisoners are and the

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:18.540
cell where the prisoners are and the
 

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:19.520
cell where the prisoners are and the
prisoners don't where they're being

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:19.530
prisoners don't where they're being
 

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:21.410
prisoners don't where they're being
watched so what happens is the notion is

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:21.420
watched so what happens is the notion is
 

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:23.630
watched so what happens is the notion is
that surveillance and information itself

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:23.640
that surveillance and information itself
 

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:27.020
that surveillance and information itself
changes the rates at which people behave

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:27.030
changes the rates at which people behave
 

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:28.520
changes the rates at which people behave
and so people actually behave better

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:28.530
and so people actually behave better
 

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:29.270
and so people actually behave better
because of that

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:29.280
because of that
 

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.040
because of that
and we were right down for the next lab

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:31.050
and we were right down for the next lab
 

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:33.680

has had a big impact on people but the
 

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:50.900
has had a big impact on people but the
power structures behind those have been

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:50.910
power structures behind those have been
 

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:53.750

that was used since it was put in place
 

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:51.610
that was used since it was put in place
in 2011 so this is auditioning a

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:51.620
in 2011 so this is auditioning a
 

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:53.800
in 2011 so this is auditioning a
Pennsylvania into 18 districts and I

mean you notice all sorts of funny

00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:55.820
mean you notice all sorts of funny
 

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:56.920
mean you notice all sorts of funny
things about it so of course there are

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:56.930
things about it so of course there are
 

00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:58.690
things about it so of course there are
some districts with funny shapes there's

00:18:58.690 --> 00:18:58.700
some districts with funny shapes there's
 

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:00.400
some districts with funny shapes there's
this red district in the bottom right

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:00.410
this red district in the bottom right
 

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:02.950
this red district in the bottom right
that is particularly unusual so if you

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:02.960
that is particularly unusual so if you
 

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:04.630
that is particularly unusual so if you
look at it just right it can look like

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:04.640
look at it just right it can look like
 

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:07.650
look at it just right it can look like
goofy kicking Donald Duck

00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:07.660
goofy kicking Donald Duck
 

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:13.360
goofy kicking Donald Duck
but yeah so but that there are also you

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:13.370
but yeah so but that there are also you
 

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:15.070
but yeah so but that there are also you
know less immediately apparent things

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:15.080
know less immediately apparent things
 

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:16.570
know less immediately apparent things
that are quite remarkable about this

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:16.580
that are quite remarkable about this
 

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:19.330
that are quite remarkable about this
districting so in every election in

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:19.340
districting so in every election in
 

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:22.000
districting so in every election in
which this district has been used the

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:22.010
which this district has been used the
 

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:23.620
which this district has been used the
party that drew it so in this case the

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:23.630
party that drew it so in this case the
 

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:24.730
party that drew it so in this case the
Republican Party because they had

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:24.740
Republican Party because they had
 

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:26.560
Republican Party because they had
control the state legislature when the

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:26.570
control the state legislature when the
 

00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:29.560
control the state legislature when the
decision was drawn has won 13 out of the

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:29.570
decision was drawn has won 13 out of the
 

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:32.500
decision was drawn has won 13 out of the
18 seats and and that happened even

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:32.510
18 seats and and that happened even
 

00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:34.870
18 seats and and that happened even
years when Democrats won a majority of

00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:34.880
years when Democrats won a majority of
 

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:36.970
years when Democrats won a majority of
the statewide congressional votes so for

00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:36.980
the statewide congressional votes so for
 

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:39.820
the statewide congressional votes so for
example in 2012 Democrats won a majority

00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:39.830
example in 2012 Democrats won a majority
 

00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:41.590
example in 2012 Democrats won a majority
of the votes statewide in the

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:41.600
of the votes statewide in the
 

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:43.030
of the votes statewide in the
congressional elections but won only

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:43.040
congressional elections but won only
 

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:45.370
congressional elections but won only
five of the 18 seats so it's a really

00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:45.380
five of the 18 seats so it's a really
 

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:48.040
five of the 18 seats so it's a really
remarkable districting and of course

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:48.050
remarkable districting and of course
 

00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:50.020
remarkable districting and of course
that has led to the idea that this

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:50.030
that has led to the idea that this
 

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:51.200
that has led to the idea that this
districting and

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:51.210
districting and
 

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:54.230
districting and
possibly others may well have been drawn

00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:54.240
possibly others may well have been drawn
 

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:56.750
possibly others may well have been drawn
intentionally to create this advantage

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:56.760
intentionally to create this advantage
 

00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:58.990
intentionally to create this advantage
for the party that was the drew it and

00:19:58.990 --> 00:19:59.000
for the party that was the drew it and
 

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.580
for the party that was the drew it and
and okay I mean when you look at this

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:01.590
and okay I mean when you look at this
 

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:03.710
and okay I mean when you look at this
district somehow that seems very natural

00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:03.720
district somehow that seems very natural
 

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:06.860
district somehow that seems very natural
that's a suspect and I mean one

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:06.870
that's a suspect and I mean one
 

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:08.389
that's a suspect and I mean one
important question though is how we can

00:20:08.389 --> 00:20:08.399
important question though is how we can
 

00:20:08.399 --> 00:20:10.760
important question though is how we can
develop a rigorous way of evaluating

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:10.770
develop a rigorous way of evaluating
 

00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:13.970
develop a rigorous way of evaluating
this and distinguishing intentional

00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:13.980
this and distinguishing intentional
 

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:15.649
this and distinguishing intentional
drawing of districts like this from

00:20:15.649 --> 00:20:15.659
drawing of districts like this from
 

00:20:15.659 --> 00:20:18.350
drawing of districts like this from
things that just arise sort of by

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:18.360
things that just arise sort of by
 

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:19.820
things that just arise sort of by
accident because one thing that's not

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:19.830
accident because one thing that's not
 

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:22.370
accident because one thing that's not
obvious but it's true is that if you

00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:22.380
obvious but it's true is that if you
 

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:24.620
obvious but it's true is that if you
just haphazardly district Pennsylvania

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:24.630
just haphazardly district Pennsylvania
 

00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:26.810
just haphazardly district Pennsylvania
into eighteen districts you can easily

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:26.820
into eighteen districts you can easily
 

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:29.210
into eighteen districts you can easily
get a districting that favors the

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:29.220
get a districting that favors the
 

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:31.039
get a districting that favors the
Republicans by some margin just because

00:20:31.039 --> 00:20:31.049
Republicans by some margin just because
 

00:20:31.049 --> 00:20:32.720
Republicans by some margin just because
the political geography of Democrats and

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:32.730
the political geography of Democrats and
 

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:34.730
the political geography of Democrats and
Republicans are not the same right so

00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:34.740
Republicans are not the same right so
 

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:36.590
Republicans are not the same right so
Democrats are clustered in in cities

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:36.600
Democrats are clustered in in cities
 

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:38.840
Democrats are clustered in in cities
much more actually than the Republicans

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:38.850
much more actually than the Republicans
 

00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:41.299
much more actually than the Republicans
are dominant in rural areas so for

00:20:41.299 --> 00:20:41.309
are dominant in rural areas so for
 

00:20:41.309 --> 00:20:43.250
are dominant in rural areas so for
example the most democratic party part

00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:43.260
example the most democratic party part
 

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:45.019
example the most democratic party part
of a state is always more Democrat or

00:20:45.019 --> 00:20:45.029
of a state is always more Democrat or
 

00:20:45.029 --> 00:20:46.279
of a state is always more Democrat or
almost always more Democrat than the

00:20:46.279 --> 00:20:46.289
almost always more Democrat than the
 

00:20:46.289 --> 00:20:49.610
almost always more Democrat than the
most Republican part of a state and so

00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:49.620
most Republican part of a state and so
 

00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:52.159
most Republican part of a state and so

in the computational biology department
 

00:20:58.020 --> 00:20:59.720
in the computational biology department
there we developed a method and I'm

00:20:59.720 --> 00:20:59.730
there we developed a method and I'm
 

00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:01.010
there we developed a method and I'm
gonna start by just showing you the

00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:01.020
gonna start by just showing you the
 

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:03.220
gonna start by just showing you the
mechanics of the method so in this video

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:03.230
mechanics of the method so in this video
 

00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:06.110
mechanics of the method so in this video
which is playing now what you see

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:06.120
which is playing now what you see
 

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:09.950
which is playing now what you see
happening is a sequence of small random

00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:09.960
happening is a sequence of small random
 

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:11.840
happening is a sequence of small random
changes being made to the districting so

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:11.850
changes being made to the districting so
 

00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:13.669
changes being made to the districting so
voting precincts on the boundary of

00:21:13.669 --> 00:21:13.679
voting precincts on the boundary of
 

00:21:13.679 --> 00:21:15.289
voting precincts on the boundary of
districts are randomly chosen and then

00:21:15.289 --> 00:21:15.299
districts are randomly chosen and then
 

00:21:15.299 --> 00:21:16.970
districts are randomly chosen and then
the membership with that is which

00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:16.980
the membership with that is which
 

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:18.769
the membership with that is which
district they belong to has changed and

00:21:18.769 --> 00:21:18.779
district they belong to has changed and
 

00:21:18.779 --> 00:21:21.320
district they belong to has changed and
so over time the districting is slowly

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:21.330
so over time the districting is slowly
 

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:24.049
so over time the districting is slowly
evolving right so you know if you if you

00:21:24.049 --> 00:21:24.059
evolving right so you know if you if you
 

00:21:24.059 --> 00:21:25.730
evolving right so you know if you if you

eventually Goofy's gonna lose his nose
 

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:28.970
eventually Goofy's gonna lose his nose
here and then eventually his ears and

you know just slowly he's going to morph

00:21:30.529 --> 00:21:30.539
you know just slowly he's going to morph
 

00:21:30.539 --> 00:21:32.600
you know just slowly he's going to morph

no longer owned by Disney and and so the

00:21:36.139 --> 00:21:36.149
no longer owned by Disney and and so the
 

00:21:36.149 --> 00:21:37.730
no longer owned by Disney and and so the
point is right somehow what you're doing

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:37.740
point is right somehow what you're doing
 

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:39.740
point is right somehow what you're doing
is you're just messing with the lines in

00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:39.750
is you're just messing with the lines in
 

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:41.779
is you're just messing with the lines in
these subtle ways and what you observe

00:21:41.779 --> 00:21:41.789
these subtle ways and what you observe
 

00:21:41.789 --> 00:21:44.840
these subtle ways and what you observe
when you do this is that very quickly

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:44.850
when you do this is that very quickly
 

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:46.639
when you do this is that very quickly
the districting is that you see have

00:21:46.639 --> 00:21:46.649
the districting is that you see have
 

00:21:46.649 --> 00:21:48.980
the districting is that you see have
less partisan advantage than the one

00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:48.990
less partisan advantage than the one
 

00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:50.930
less partisan advantage than the one
that you started with right so as you

00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:50.940
that you started with right so as you
 

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:53.120
that you started with right so as you
start making these random changes the

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:53.130
start making these random changes the
 

00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:54.710
start making these random changes the

these changes you can almost hear the

00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:02.940
these changes you can almost hear the

that's exactly that's exactly how I
 

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:08.539
that's exactly that's exactly how I
wanted it right as soon as you make that

weather cycles so if you think about

00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:55.140
weather cycles so if you think about
 

00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:57.340
weather cycles so if you think about
anything geared towards environmental

they happen in the same day so it

00:27:06.290 --> 00:27:06.300
they happen in the same day so it
 

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:07.669
they happen in the same day so it
becomes it becomes challenging it's not

from the technical side and also there's

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:27.120
from the technical side and also there's
 

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:28.490

00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:34.419
and how can we make this procedures a
rigorous tool that can be used by a

00:34:34.419 --> 00:34:34.429
rigorous tool that can be used by a
 

00:34:34.429 --> 00:34:37.659
rigorous tool that can be used by a
court to reliably and rigorously tell

00:34:37.659 --> 00:34:37.669
court to reliably and rigorously tell
 

00:34:37.669 --> 00:34:39.190
court to reliably and rigorously tell
when a district was actually drawn with

00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:39.200
when a district was actually drawn with
 

00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:40.900
when a district was actually drawn with
intent and when it wasn't and so

00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:40.910
intent and when it wasn't and so
 

00:34:40.910 --> 00:34:42.940
intent and when it wasn't and so
remember I described this procedure

00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:42.950
remember I described this procedure
 

00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:44.500
remember I described this procedure
where we make these random changes and

00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:44.510
where we make these random changes and
 

00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:45.669
where we make these random changes and
we see that the partisanship of the

00:34:45.669 --> 00:34:45.679
we see that the partisanship of the
 

00:34:45.679 --> 00:34:47.200
we see that the partisanship of the
district evaporates and already that's

00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:47.210
district evaporates and already that's
 

00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:49.180
district evaporates and already that's
this strong intuitive evidence that

random changes to it okay and this
 

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:01.990
random changes to it okay and this
sounds like it's a question about where

00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:02.000
sounds like it's a question about where
 

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.730
sounds like it's a question about where
people live in the state and remember I

00:36:03.730 --> 00:36:03.740
people live in the state and remember I
 

00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:04.870
people live in the state and remember I
said I'm from the math department so I

00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:04.880
said I'm from the math department so I
 

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:06.190
said I'm from the math department so I
have no idea where people live in the

have no idea where people live in the
state we can ask these other people

00:36:08.830 --> 00:36:08.840
state we can ask these other people
 

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:10.810
state we can ask these other people
where they live I don't know okay so

00:36:10.810 --> 00:36:10.820
where they live I don't know okay so
 

00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:13.540
where they live I don't know okay so
though the way we address that questions

00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:13.550
though the way we address that questions
 

00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:14.980
though the way we address that questions
from mathematics is that we proved a

00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:14.990
from mathematics is that we proved a
 

00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:17.230
from mathematics is that we proved a
theorem which says in a very general

00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:17.240
theorem which says in a very general
 

00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:20.080
theorem which says in a very general
setting so okay it's sort of stripping

00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:20.090
setting so okay it's sort of stripping
 

00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:21.760
setting so okay it's sort of stripping
out the technical terms the theorem says

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:21.770
out the technical terms the theorem says
 

00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:23.410
out the technical terms the theorem says
that if I start with the typical object

00:36:23.410 --> 00:36:23.420
that if I start with the typical object
 

00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:25.810
that if I start with the typical object
in a very general sense a sequence of

00:36:25.810 --> 00:36:25.820
in a very general sense a sequence of
 

00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:27.430
in a very general sense a sequence of
random changes made to the typical

00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:27.440
random changes made to the typical
 

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:30.880
random changes made to the typical
object will never tend to change the

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:30.890
object will never tend to change the
 

00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:33.700
object will never tend to change the
object in a consistent way so if I start

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:33.710
object in a consistent way so if I start
 

00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:35.680
object in a consistent way so if I start
with a truly typical thing random

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:35.690
with a truly typical thing random
 

00:36:35.690 --> 00:36:38.320
with a truly typical thing random
changes of course can change the object

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:38.330
changes of course can change the object
 

00:36:38.330 --> 00:36:39.670
changes of course can change the object
maybe I always get something different

00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:39.680
maybe I always get something different
 

00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:41.859
maybe I always get something different
but not in a consistent way which is

00:36:41.859 --> 00:36:41.869
but not in a consistent way which is
 

00:36:41.869 --> 00:36:43.390
but not in a consistent way which is
exactly what we saw with this district

00:36:43.390 --> 00:36:43.400
exactly what we saw with this district
 

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:44.920
exactly what we saw with this district
districting right we start with a

00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:44.930
districting right we start with a
 

00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:46.330
districting right we start with a
districting we made a sequence of random

00:36:46.330 --> 00:36:46.340
districting we made a sequence of random
 

00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:47.830
districting we made a sequence of random
changes and the district got

00:36:47.830 --> 00:36:47.840
changes and the district got
 

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:50.200
changes and the district got
consistently less favorable to the

consistently less favorable to the
 

00:36:50.210 --> 00:36:52.240
consistently less favorable to the
political party that drew it and our

political party that drew it and our
 

00:36:52.250 --> 00:36:54.040

theorem then gives gives us a way of

00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:54.050
theorem then gives gives us a way of
 

00:36:54.050 --> 00:36:56.080
theorem then gives gives us a way of
quantifying exactly how unlikely that is

00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:56.090
quantifying exactly how unlikely that is
 

00:36:56.090 --> 00:36:58.030
quantifying exactly how unlikely that is
so we can tell the court the chance of

00:36:58.030 --> 00:36:58.040
so we can tell the court the chance of
 

00:36:58.040 --> 00:36:59.770
so we can tell the court the chance of
this happening for typical district in

00:36:59.770 --> 00:36:59.780
this happening for typical district in
 

00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:02.470
this happening for typical district in
Pennsylvania is one in 10,000 right we

00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:02.480
Pennsylvania is one in 10,000 right we
 

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:05.080
Pennsylvania is one in 10,000 right we
can give rigorous quantifiable answers

00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:05.090
can give rigorous quantifiable answers
 

00:37:05.090 --> 00:37:06.849
can give rigorous quantifiable answers
to how likely this is to happen just by

00:37:06.849 --> 00:37:06.859
to how likely this is to happen just by
 

00:37:06.859 --> 00:37:08.920
to how likely this is to happen just by
accident in a way that then you can use

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:08.930
accident in a way that then you can use
 

00:37:08.930 --> 00:37:10.570
accident in a way that then you can use
that to make a rigorous conclusion about

00:37:10.570 --> 00:37:10.580
that to make a rigorous conclusion about
 

00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:13.330
that to make a rigorous conclusion about
what you know and okay so let me turn

00:37:13.330 --> 00:37:13.340
what you know and okay so let me turn
 

00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:15.100
what you know and okay so let me turn
back tomorrow

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:15.110

collect data for a variety of uses I
 

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:50.900
