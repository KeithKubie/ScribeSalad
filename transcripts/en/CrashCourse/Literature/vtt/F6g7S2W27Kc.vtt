Hi, I’m John Green, this is
Crash Course Literature,

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.480
and today we’re gonna talk about
Kurt Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse Five.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.061
Mr. Green, Mr. Green! You mean, like the Motown
group that sings that song - glad all over!

00:00:10.061 --> 00:00:14.560
No singing, Me From the Past! And no, it is
not a Motown group! You’re thinking of the

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.560
Dave Clark Five, and for the record, they
were not a Motown group, they were British.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:27.580
[Theme Song]

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.060
So, Slaughterhouse Five, also known by its
underappreciated alternate title, The Children’s

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.879
Crusade, is one of the most widely read antiwar
books of the late twentieth century.

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:39.229
It was written by Kurt Vonnegut during the
height of the Vietnam War, but this novel

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:43.920
is an attempt to chronicle the violence of
the World War II bombing of Dresden and modern

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.469
warfare more broadly. But it’s important
to understand, again, those two historical

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:51.679
contexts. The one in which the book was written
and the one the book is about.

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:55.710
And the question at the heart of Slaughterhouse
Five is what role can literature, particularly

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.109
works of literary fiction, play in addressing
large scale acts of violence? What is the

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.430
role of literature in examining war?
But of course that makes Slaughterhouse Five

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.380
sound very sad and serious, which it is, but
it’s also a surprisingly and very weirdly

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.520
funny book. Let’s start with an outline
of the main events of Slaughterhouse Five.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.780
in the Thought Bubble. So,
Vonnegut’s protagonist is Billy Pilgrim.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.340
But rather than being on a linear journey
toward a holy place, as his name might suggest,

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.890
Pilgrim has flashbacks (and fantasies) that
he believes are actual time travel. Pilgrim

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.479
describes himself as being “unstuck in time.”
And rather than describing his life events

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.229
in chronological order, he jumps between times
and places.

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.939
The events that comprise Pilgrim’s disjointed
narrative actually have quite a logical progression.

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:44.460
Like a rough outline of them looks like this:
Pilgrim fought in World War II. He was a prisoner

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.289
of war in Germany. He was being held in Dresden
when that city was largely destroyed by Allied

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:53.820
bombing toward the end of the war. And Pilgrim
survived because he and his fellow prisoners

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.259
were held sixty feet underground in a former
slaughterhouse. After the firestorm, Pilgrim

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.619
and his fellow detainees are put to work cleaning
up the charred remains of bodies. And then

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:07.609
after the war, Billy Pilgrim has trouble returning
to civilian life, spends some time in a mental

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:10.110
institution, but then eventually marries and
becomes an optometrist.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.350
A profession, it rather goes without saying,
that involves sight.

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.530
Anyway, then Pilgrim has a breakdown while
listening to a barbershop quartet, whose expressions

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.370
remind him of his guards at Dresden. He becomes
convinced that aliens (Tralfamadorians) abducted

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.840
him and increasingly unmoored, Pilgrim publicly
professes the Tralfamadorian vision of time and space.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.600
Now Pilgrim’s narrative sounds a little crazy (especially since it’s delivered in such a nonlinear manner),

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.460
but Vonnegut makes the logic of his
mental breakdown perfectly clear.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:43.100
As such, Vonnegut creates a novel that demonstrates how war trauma affects the individual psyche.

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.220
Thanks, Thought Bubble. So, where did Vonnegut
get all of these insights? Well in part, they

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.920
came from Vonnegut’s own experience in the
war, as he acknowledges in the book. It’s

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.980
very interesting that the first and last chapters
of Slaughterhouse Five are written in first

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.120
person from the perspective of Kurt Vonnegut.
In the very beginning of the novel and at

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.020
the very end, he calls attention to the fact
that we are reading a novel.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.820
That’s an unusual and bold choice because
generally as readers we want to forget that

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.440
we’re reading a story, right? And feel like
we’re living inside reality. But Vonnegut wants

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.640
to unmoor us from our expectations of fiction,
just as Billy Pilgrim is unmoored from time.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.550
Kurt Vonnegut was born -- Oh, it’s time
for the open letter! Hey there, Kurt Vonnegut.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.760
Dear Kurt Vonnegut, I actually met you once
at the University of Alabama. My primary memory

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.980
of that evening is that someone came up to
you and said, “Sir, you can’t smoke in

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.230
here.” And you replied, “Well, I can smoke
or I can leave!”

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.180
You were and remain a great inspiration to
me as a writer and one thing that I always

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.730
think about with you is that even though obviously
you had a pretty screwed-up life, I always

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.480
felt like you had it figured out.
Long story short, I love you Kurt Vonnegut.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.260
Kurt Puppet: I love you too!
John: Aw, thank you Kurt! Best wishes, John Green.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:59.080
Anyway, Vonnegut was born in beautiful Indianapolis
in 1922, he spent some time at Cornell University

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.330
before entering the United States army at
the age of twenty. Like Billy Pilgrim, he

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.330
was shipped to Europe, had a very brief combat
experience, and then became a prisoner of

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.480
war during the Battle of the Bulge, which
you’ll remember from Crash Course history.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.260
And then like Pilgrim, Vonnegut was sent to
Dresden, where he was interred at a former

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.980
slaughterhouse. At the time, Dresden was considered
a relatively safe place to be. In Slaughterhouse

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.340
Five, an English officer envies the American
prisoners who are sent to Dresden, he says:

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.750
You needn’t worry about bombs […] Dresden
is an open city. It is undefended, and contains

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.030
no war industries or troop concentrations
of any importance.

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.660
But it turns out, of course, that in World
War II, such things were not prerequisites

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.490
for getting bombed.
Between February 13th and 15th of 1945, British

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:45.310
and American bombers dropped nearly 4,000
tons of bombs and incendiary devices on Dresden.

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.900
This created a firestorm that destroyed an
enormous part of the city and cost tens of

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.960
thousands of lives.
And then Dresden was subject to more air raids

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.600
of this sort in March and April. Now by all accounts,
the suffering on the ground was tremendous.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:03.940
But writers, artists, and historians have found it difficult
to adequately convey the horrors that took place.

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.139
Vonnegut approaches the need to testify to
these events in Slaughterhouse Five by using

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:12.979
a fictional narrative that seeks to both understand
and evade the past.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.760
Like although his narrator was in Dresden
during the bombing and firestorm, he learns

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.840
what took place by eavesdropping on whispering
guards.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.740
And that’s a way of diminishing the immediacy
of violence to rumor. Like Pilgrim reports

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.010
the guards’ conversation as follows:
There was a fire-storm out there. Dresden

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:34.850
was one big flame. The one flame ate everything
organic, everything that would burn.

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:38.650
This conversation of whispers, transmitted
in a foreign language, and translated by the

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:43.400
author is remembered many years after the
fact. And as readers, we have plenty of reason

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.080
to question it.
I mean, just look at the vague nature of the

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.040
language used. Consider the repetition of
“everything” (“…everything organic,

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.980
everything that would burn”).
Well, “everything” is a pretty broad concept.

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:58.800
And in this context, it allows the narrator
not to imagine the specific, horrible details.

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:03.290
Like here, vague language provides a stand-in
for detailed testimony.

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:07.000
But there’s also something horrific and
visceral about that idea generally. The idea

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.580
of “everything organic” burning.
It implies the loss of not just our lives

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.690
but all life.
Slaughterhouse Five also uses figures of speech

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:18.960
as a means of evasion.
The sun was an angry little pinhead. Dresden

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.020
was like the moon now, nothing but minerals.
I mean, just as you can’t look directly

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.960
at the sun, Billy Pilgrim can’t look directly
at the destruction of Dresden.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.770
He has to tell us what it’s like because what
it is is unspeakable. And this sort of evasion

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:37.190
is very common in eyewitness reports of violence.
In fact, Sebald chronicled how often eyewitness

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:41.650
reports of the bombing of German cities
contained “stereotypical phrases.”

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:48.080
These clichés, he explains, “cover up and neutralize experiences beyond our ability to comprehend."

00:06:48.082 --> 00:06:54.720
The quote “unreal effect” that they produce is a very real depiction of how the human mind reacts to extreme suffering.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:07:00.340
Here’s another example of trying to see the horror of war by not looking directly at it. Vonnegut describes the

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:05.840
post-bombing Dresden as a mute reflection in the contorted faces of prison guards, and he creates a

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.880
shocking and memorable image:
The guards drew together instinctively, rolled

00:07:09.889 --> 00:07:15.449
their eyes. They experimented with one expression
and then another, said nothing, though their

00:07:15.449 --> 00:07:20.309
mouths were often open. They looked like a
silent film of a barbershop quartet.

00:07:20.309 --> 00:07:23.900
So what does this say about the guards? What
are we to make of the silence in this scene?

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:29.650
Why is it that the guards say nothing? Finally,
why might Vonnegut use this goofy metaphor

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:34.050
of a barbershop quartet in a silent film at
this particular moment? Are we supposed to

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:38.710
laugh at absurd moments like this or the repetition
of the phrase “so it goes” whenever someone

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:41.150
dies?
And if we do feel that instinct to laugh,

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:45.020
are we then meant to cringe at ourselves for
having had that impulse?

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:48.699
Regardless, that image doesn’t go where
we expect it to and so it’s designed to

00:07:48.699 --> 00:07:52.459
make us uncomfortable. And that’s its power.
That’s its beauty.

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:56.560
And it’s worth remembering that Vonnegut
describes himself as often feeling speechless

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.830
when thinking about the bombing of Dresden.
Like in the first chapter of Slaughterhouse

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:01.970
Five, he writes:
I thought it would be easy for me to write

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:05.610
about the destruction of Dresden since all
I would have to do would be to report what

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:09.270
I had seen. And I thought too it would be
a masterpiece, or at least make me a lot of

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:14.199
money since the subject was so big. But not
many words about Dresden came from my mind

00:08:14.199 --> 00:08:17.860
then… and not many words come now, either.
And it’s clear that Vonnegut has a pretty

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:23.330
complicated relationship with the words that
eventually do, in fact, come. Like his novel,

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:28.490
famously, opens with the following lines:
All this happened, more or less. The war parts,

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:32.149
anyway, are pretty much true.
Pretty much true? That’s another phrase

00:08:32.149 --> 00:08:35.579
that’s designed to make us uncomfortable.
And as Vonnegut hints at in that passage I

00:08:35.579 --> 00:08:39.979
just read, what does it mean for Vonnegut to
gain acclaim and wealth for what he has written?

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:43.620
In an introduction to the 1976 edition
of Slaughterhouse Five, Vonnegut expresses

00:08:43.629 --> 00:08:49.119
some guilt at having benefited from its publication:
The Dresden atrocity, tremendously expensive

00:08:49.119 --> 00:08:54.869
and meticulously planned, was so meaningless,
finally, that only one person on the entire

00:08:54.869 --> 00:08:59.699
planet got any benefit from it. I am that
person. I wrote this book, which earned a

00:08:59.699 --> 00:09:05.019
lot of money for me and made my reputation,
such as it is. One way or another, I got two

00:09:05.019 --> 00:09:08.459
or three dollars for every person killed.
Some business I'm in.

00:09:08.459 --> 00:09:12.589
Now that’s a classic example of Vonnegut’s
self-deprecating humor, but the “business”

00:09:12.589 --> 00:09:17.050
of providing testimony does remain important
work, I would argue — even if it is through

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:21.720
the flawed vehicle of narrative fiction.
Precisely because it struggles to look directly

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:25.869
at the firebombing of Dresden, Slaughterhouse
Five provides ways of thinking about how we

00:09:25.869 --> 00:09:30.259
live and love and fight and heal.
And it makes us think about how we frame the

00:09:30.259 --> 00:09:35.209
stories that we tell ourselves about the past.
And Billy Pilgrim’s unstuckness in time

00:09:35.209 --> 00:09:39.009
reminds us that, as the great William Faulkner
wrote, “The past isn’t dead. It’s not

00:09:39.009 --> 00:09:41.829
even past.”
Next week, we’ll talk about Billy Pilgrim’s

00:09:41.829 --> 00:09:45.869
alternate universe filled with toilet-plunger
aliens who offer a new perspective on the

00:09:45.869 --> 00:09:50.230
violence of mankind. And we’ll discuss the
philosophy of Tralfamadorians (a philosophy

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:54.749
summed up by the phrase, “and so it goes”).
And, finally, we will consider what, if anything,

00:09:54.749 --> 00:10:00.459
an “anti-war” can do about war, or really
about anything else. Thanks for watching,

00:10:00.459 --> 00:10:03.259
