00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.000
The MemeMe app let's you create
a meme with an image and some text.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.180
Everyone loves a good meme.

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.610
And it's easy to get
a laugh from friends.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.160
This is the meme editor view controller.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.400
It let's you select a picture and
edit text at the top and

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.200
the bottom of the picture.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.220
The picture can be selected from
the device's photo album or

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.010
by using the camera.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.020
When I press on the camera button in the
bottom toolbar, the camera launches and

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.280
I can take a new picture
to use in a meme.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.820
When I press on the album button,

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.580
I'm brought to the photo library where
I can choose from recent photos.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.830
I like this one of the baby hedgehog.

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.680
Whether we're using the camera or
the album, you'll use

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.540
Apple's UIImagePickerController
to select your image.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.830
After I've chosen an image,
I return to the Meme Editor.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.580
Notice that because of the shape
of the hedgehog picture,

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.450
I'm making my meme in landscape mode.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.300
Here text is entered into a text field.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.900
When the editing is complete we show
the text in an outlined white font.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.590
It's slightly different from
impact to the true meme font, but

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.200
it's pretty close, and
available among Iowa stock funds.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.390
When I click inside the bottom text
field, notice how the view slides up so

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.680
that the keyboard doesn't
obscure the bottom text field.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.240
Now our meme is ready to go,
so let's share it.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.480
You can find the share button
in the upper left corner.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.400
And here's our old friend,
the activity view controller.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.346
Let's send this to Kunal.

00:01:22.446 --> 00:01:23.710
And that's all there is to it.
