Do you root for Sharks? Are you a Bears fan?
Or are the Bengals more your team? Today,

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.019
on DNews we’re rooting for apex predators!

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:17.320
Hi Everyone, Crystal here for DNews. From
saber tooth tigers to imaginary monsters under

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.730
our beds, powerful apex predators have caught
human attention since prehistoric times. We

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.390
imitate them, we worship them, we display
their teeth, heads, and claws as trophies

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.729
and ultimately, we’re completely terrified
of them.

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:34.240
Apex predators are so called because of their
position at the very top of the food chain.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.750
You can think of the space they occupy in
an ecosystem as the peak segment of the ecological

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.910
pyramid. Nobody preys on them! and they, eat
the lower species making up the wider pyramid

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:44.230
below.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.320
But today, I’m not here to talk about why
we should be afraid of them. I’m here to

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.360
tell you why we should all appreciate the
apex predator for the helpful, stabilizing

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.650
influences they really are.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.710
Apex predators play a critical role in what
scientists call the “Trophic Cascade”.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.120
The trophic level of an organism defines its
position in the food chain. Apex predators

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.299
sit at the highest trophic level, and a cascade
is described by something like: Tiger Sharks,

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:10.369
eat sea turtles, that eat sea grass.

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.859
Perhaps the most publicized example of a trophic
cascade comes from Yellowstone National Park

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:19.340
and it all starts with the wolf. The culling
of wolves from the park to near extinction

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.740
in the 1930s and 40s lead to severe consequences
including a reduction in biodiversity and

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.450
a concerning disappearance of aspen, cottonwood,
and willow trees due to overgrazing by elk,

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.289
wolves natural prey. Several articles published
by Beschta and Ripple from Oregon State University

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:38.340
documented the impact of wolf reintroduction
on diversity and landscape, demonstrating

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.350
that wolves relieve the pressure placed on
flora by herbivores, leading to more robust

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.889
areas of woody growth which consequently strengthen
and improve habitats for species like bison.

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:54.060
But there are multiple cascades affected by
size of elk population and for some, we may

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.549
not have acted quickly enough.

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.469
A decade long study performed by scientists
at Colorado State University and published

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:03.920
in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B,
showed that after almost a hundred years without

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.800
them, simply reintroducing wolves wasn't enough
for the Park’s waning willow tree which

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.960
are a tasty treat for elk. The willow tree
supplies food and habitat for beavers whose

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.850
activities temper the seasonal ebbs and flows
of river runoff, recharge the water table;

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.420
and provide an ideal environment for fish.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.730
Now, even with elk populations back under
predatory control, ecologists are discovering

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.010
that they must gently finesse the balance
between beaver and willow to halt riverbank

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.629
erosion and channel widening which of course
have negative “downstream” consequences

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:37.350
… see what I did there? ;)

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.220
This all just goes to show that when we attempt
to pick one thing out of an ecosystem, like

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.710
the scary and predatory wolf, we find it “hitched
to everything else” and the system falls

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:46.040
apart.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.150
Okay, at this point, you all might be thinking
“I get it. Apex predators keep everything

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.230
in check, but what keeps apex predators in
check so that they don't over feed and collapse

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.970
entire ecosystems on their own?” The answer
to that, is two fold. Of course apex predators

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.010
are sensitive to the availability of prey,
if they over hunt their territory, lack of

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.260
available food will have a shrinking effect
on their population. But apex predators are

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.600
typically large animals with longer gestation
periods, so reproducing takes time and a lot

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.020
of energy. A recent study published in the
journal OIKOS even suggested that community

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.360
behavior might come into play. Observing that
some apex predators control the size of their

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.220
own populations though infanticide and preferential
breeding.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.690
Either way, the energy demands to hunt, defend
their territory from intruders, breed, and

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.300
raise their young are very high for apex predators.
This means that much of their time is dedicated

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.960
to defense and reproduction and they only
hunt when they have to. Just another reason

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.960
to respect apex predators.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:46.130
For some apex predators of the sea, tune into
Shark Week which kicks off Sunday, June 26th

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.690
8/7c

00:03:46.690 --> 00:04:05.020
Or watch this video by Tara on what we can
do to keep sharks from going extinct

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.610
What do you think? Do predators make the world
a better place? Or should we let our herbivore

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.500
friends graze in peace? Subscribe to DNews
