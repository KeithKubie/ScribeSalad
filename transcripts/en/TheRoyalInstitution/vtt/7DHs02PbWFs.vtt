00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.350
Careful... Is it working so far? 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:23.170
Okay, look! We've already got our tower twice the height that we had it. Can we go any higher...?

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.920
It might not look like the smartest thing
to do, to let your children make this

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.250
kind of a mess in the kitchen,

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.530
but we've had loads of fun today building
with marshmallows and spaghetti, so from my

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.420
point of view it's completely been
worth it.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.850
You probably have toys at home like LEGO
or some other kind of building toys

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.000
but we decided to use these today
because in some ways the challenges that

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.710
you face

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.360
working with these materials are actually
more like the challenges that real

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.840
engineers face. One of those
challenges is thinking about the

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.960
properties of the materials that you're using. Their flexibility,

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.670
and their strength. It has also been
huge

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.300
fun for me to watch my own children
discover for themselves

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.250
the kind of shapes that work well for
building and those that don't.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.130
I can make a square? Try and make a square, yeah.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.870
Ah, that's good way to make a tower.

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.220
Yes, Lorenzo, you try to make a square as well, see how you get on.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.150
So Alice, this is going to be a big cube is it?

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.620
What do you think is going to happen when I let go?

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.080
Umm... it's going to fall.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.040
And what way is it going to fall?

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.020
Sideways and go like that!

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.350
Do you want to see? Here we go. Yes! 
So is there anything you could do with the spaghetti

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.860
 to stop it moving like this?

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.320
I could maybe put this in the middle here?

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.380
Okay, try that. But I need to find a longer one.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.320
I think they're all the same length, you might need to join them or something.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.680
The spaghetti was too long, 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.500
and the cube is of all equal sides. In order to the diaganol

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.260
they have to be of different lengths,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.120
and the cube had to be smaller. 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.150
So are you going to try making a smaller one? Yeah!

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.200
Alice, what about shapes? What
shapes do you think are strong?

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.950
Triangles... Triangles seem to be good, don't they? Doyou think we can make 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.120
another cube on top of this one?
No I think we can just make it off and then put it on.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.090
when we've finished.

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.330
Okay do you want to try to do that? Okay!

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:04.510
Careful...

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.100
A good structure needs to be stiff and
strong. That means

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.440
it can take a lot of force before it bends and collapses. 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.720
This one built by my daughter is actually not too bad.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.500
If you build a square, it only takes a little push on one of the corners

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.060
to make collapse. The corners of the square act like hinges.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.300
Any shape made out of more than three
sides 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.480
can be bent out of shape like this just by
changing the angles.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.900
Triangles cannot change shape
like this because the corners are not

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:35.730
like hinges.

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.100
The third side holds the other two in
place, so this means

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.950
that you can apply a lot more force and it
still keeps

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.170
its basic shape. This is what makes them
good

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.930
for building structures. 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.470
No, no no! Ah yes! Yes, yes, yes! 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.110
Scientists have invented all sorts of wonderful materials which engineers use. 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.620
But before they can be used for

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.250
bridges, buildings and other things these
materials have to be tested

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.840
to explore their strengths and
weaknesses. 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.440
The long one breaks easier when I swirl them!

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.140
Engineers use maths and science to design the things they build, 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.000
but they also test their structures and materials to see how they work.

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.090
Today, without really knowing the

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.810
maths and science behind what they were
doing, I watched my children

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.210
experience the process of building,
testing

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.830
and modifying structures, and along the
way learn some of the key ideas that

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:34.880
engineers need to know.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.610
I enjoyed doing with my children today
because it's not only

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.610
a hands-on activity but it's also one that gets them thinking.

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.020
And as a little bonus at the end you
can eat

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.020
the leftover building materials.
