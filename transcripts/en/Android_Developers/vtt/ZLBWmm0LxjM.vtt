NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Hi,
I'm Natalie Villalobos,

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.690
here at Big Android BBQ in
Hurst, Texas with Stacy Devino.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.320
She's an Android
developer, and I just

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.944
wanted to ask her a
couple of questions

00:00:13.944 --> 00:00:16.400
before we all depart the
great state of Texas.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.870
Hey Stacy, how are you doing?

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:19.120
STACY DEVINO: Doing just fine.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.120
Ready for some meat.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.110
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: So
I see these pins on you.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:23.720
Can you tell me a little
bit about the culture

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.386
of these pins, and
how many years you've

00:00:25.386 --> 00:00:26.719
been coming to Big Android BBQ.

00:00:26.719 --> 00:00:28.260
STACY DEVINO: These
are just the pins

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.160
I've accumulated pretty
much from this BBQ

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.460
and Google I/O-- there was a big
Android event also held, like,

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.240
as an after party.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.380
So yeah, I've been
coming-- gosh,

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.700
this is probably my
fourth year, I think.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:44.470
It might be fifth.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.620
I can't tell.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.300
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: And so, it's
a part of the Android culture

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.145
to get pins from different
companies that are represented

00:00:49.145 --> 00:00:50.170
at Android events?

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.045
STACY DEVINO: Oh, no.

00:00:51.045 --> 00:00:52.610
This is a big Android thing.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.110
This is not-- but uh-- no,
it's all about representation

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.140
and it's so fabulous that
these guys actually support us.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:00.650
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Yeah, yeah.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.440
It's really cool, you
have like Facebook,

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.374
you have Golden Gate Bridge.

00:01:04.374 --> 00:01:06.540
You have some startups,
too, that were also present.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.940
So it's really cool to see that.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.724
So I wanted to get started.

00:01:10.724 --> 00:01:12.390
How did you get into
mobile development?

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.320
Like, why Android?

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.410
STACY DEVINO: So I started
really young, with a Palm.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.150
So I first learned on
Palm C in middle school,

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.760
because my dad worked
for 3Com at the time.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.900
And then that just
kept on progressing.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.370
And did stuff with
iPods, and then

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:31.980
initially some iPhone stuff.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.630
But we won't talk
so much about that.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.250
But then Android
came on the scene,

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.583
and they didn't call it hacking.

00:01:36.583 --> 00:01:37.910
They called it development.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.946
And that's what really
attracted me to Android.

00:01:39.946 --> 00:01:42.070
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: And
what was your first project

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.120
that you were proud of?

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.820
Or maybe, you even had
challenges on, but that

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.854
at the end of the day, once
you solved for it, it was--

00:01:48.854 --> 00:01:49.770
that's when you knew--

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:50.310
STACY DEVINO: I did some--

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.810
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
Your first love.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.920
STACY DEVINO: So I did some work
for the military and emergency

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.530
services, and put out
a product by myself

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.430
in a very, very
short time frame that

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.560
was kind of revolutionizing
for the industry.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.090
And I just-- I literally
worked 120 hours one week.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.930
And 90 hours was my average.

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.560
So it was-- it was
one of those things

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.530
that I just was-- I couldn't
believe I was capable of it.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.005
And you can be amazed what
you can push yourself through.

00:02:17.005 --> 00:02:18.380
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
Yeah, so when

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.580
you're in those stressful
moments, what makes you calm?

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.500
Or what-- or what is the tool
that you use to persevere?

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.040
Is it long walks on the beach?

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.092
Is it--

00:02:27.092 --> 00:02:28.550
STACY DEVINO:
Really, it's a belief

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.770
that the world was basically
revolutionized by people

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.560
no smarter, no more
capable than you are.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.370
So what's stopping you from
achieving what they did?

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.070
And there-- it's
just an inner fire.

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.420
Keep trying until you fail.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.520
And then fail again.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.680
And then-- as long as
time's still available,

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.847
fail as many times as you
can till you get it right.

00:02:50.847 --> 00:02:52.346
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
So one of things

00:02:52.346 --> 00:02:54.334
that I love about you
is that you're a maker.

00:02:54.334 --> 00:02:56.000
In a lot of different
capacities, right?

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.400
So you're an Android maker, if
you were to say it that way.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.480
But you also have been getting
into a lot of 3D printing,

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.900
and you're a member of
the Dallas Makerspace.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.400
Can you tell me a little
bit why-- about why making

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.780
is so important.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.930
STACY DEVINO: So making is
the ability to take your ideas

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.710
and make them tangible.

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:19.140
And the ability to communicate
and learn from people

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.750
beyond just work,
beyond just what people

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.430
might think that
you should know.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.420
I mean, some of my best friends
are both software developers

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.200
and blacksmiths.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.090
Things that you wouldn't
actually consider,

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.980
but it really gives you
that-- that-- this is only so

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.410
satisfying sometimes.

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.080
Sometimes you just need
to craft something,

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.770
do something creative.

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.600
And, you know, ultimately
at the end of the day,

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.120
you can't rely on
your employer to 100%

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.940
provide everything for you
in terms of creativity.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.140
You have to go and make
yourself a multi-faceted person.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.010
And that actually
ends up opening

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.310
a lot of opportunities at work.

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.226
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Yeah,
so one of the things

00:03:59.226 --> 00:04:01.740
I just wanted to share with
our developers at home,

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.540
Stacy is also a Women
Techmakers lead,

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.690
and so she created us
these really cool custom

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.840
Women Techmakers
Android figurines

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.470
that I'm going to be taking back
to my desk in Mountain View.

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.360
So speaking of that, you're
a Women Techmakers lead,

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.519
can you tell me what you
think the industry needs

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.709
to do to support more women to
come into Android development

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.674
or to be a designer or maybe
a founder of her own startup?

00:04:22.674 --> 00:04:24.090
STACY DEVINO: So
this is something

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.550
I've actually talked
about with leaders

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.480
of pretty well-known companies.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.070
It's not that we need
to encourage more.

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.780
It's just that we need
to discourage less.

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.510
We just need to tell somebody,
hey, you know, it's OK.

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:40.831
Something didn't go right.

00:04:40.831 --> 00:04:42.330
There's a lot of
feelings as a woman

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.720
that you have to be
everything to everyone.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.280
And when you say, it's OK
if something had a bug,

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.680
other person had a
bug two weeks ago.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.220
It's OK.

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.330
You're going to do well.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:05:00.110
So by actually not even just
encouraging, but just don't

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:01.550
discourage them, you know?

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.883
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Yeah, and
also don't give up, right?

00:05:03.883 --> 00:05:05.850
I think that failure
is OK, but-- and I

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.350
also think that
when you're failing,

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.300
having a supportive team that
says, oh, yeah, I failed too.

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.800
Right?

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.506
It's almost like creating a
supportive network of failure.

00:05:13.506 --> 00:05:15.380
So that no one actually
leaves the industry--

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:16.115
STACY DEVINO: The
circle of failure.

00:05:16.115 --> 00:05:17.240
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
The circle of failure.

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.930
Yeah, exactly.

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.860
So you know, I think
that you're right.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.580
When we create that kind
of ecosystem and community,

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.510
like Big Android BBQ, right?

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.035
All these people
are here and are

00:05:26.035 --> 00:05:28.520
a supportive network for when
you're developing something.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.353
STACY DEVINO: Right.

00:05:29.353 --> 00:05:29.890
Oh, totally.

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:32.540
I mean, I can't tell you
how many times, like,

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.970
I've seen Virginia's
artwork paired

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:39.200
with like another one of my
friend's development skills.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.200
And they just come out with
this totally cool thing

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.240
that they just did
after work one weekend.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.056
I mean, and we see the same
people at the same events,

00:05:48.056 --> 00:05:49.680
but that's because
they're our friends.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:50.750
They're our network.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.840
And when I have
trouble with something,

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.370
I know exactly who to
go to for that problem.

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.010
And it ultimately makes
you a better developer.

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:00.010
And a better person too.

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:01.176
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Awesome.

00:06:01.176 --> 00:06:03.830
Well, I know we all got
to get down to the BBQ.

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.540
That's what we came here for,
besides Android development.

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:06.130
STACY DEVINO: Yes, meat.

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:06.500
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
So I just want

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.840
to say thank you so much for
coming out and talking to us.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.850
And thanks so much for being
a great Women Techmakers lead,

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.990
as well.

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:12.800
STACY DEVINO: Oh, thank
you very much, Natalie.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.550
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
So, Natalie Villalobos

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.680
again bringing some
live insights and tips

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.440
from Stacy at Big Android BBQ.

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.380
I think this concludes our
interviews for Big Android BBQ

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.680
and just tune in more for Women
Techmakers sessions coming up.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.030
