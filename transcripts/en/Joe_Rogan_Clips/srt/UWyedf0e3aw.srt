1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,060
The Joe Rogan experience.
Yeah.

2
00:00:03,061 --> 00:00:05,790
I don't have that confidence
to waste the audience's time.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,170
Do you know what I mean? Like I like,
I'll see Chris rock. Yeah. Precisely.

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:13,290
A friend of mine and he'll go up and
you just like with nothing and just sit

5
00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:18,120
there and the very comfortably
for 45 minutes and just, and just,

6
00:00:18,121 --> 00:00:21,690
and just kind of talk and look for things
and has no problem with it whatsoever.

7
00:00:21,691 --> 00:00:25,980
And I let it this. He'll go.
What else? What else? And
don't like stare at the sky.

8
00:00:25,981 --> 00:00:30,450
Look at the ground. I can't, you know, who
was the master at that was Damon Wayans.

9
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,093
Oh my God.

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,810
Who a lot of people forgot a lot of
people forgot was one of the FEC and still

11
00:00:36,811 --> 00:00:38,400
is one of the best comics ever.

12
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:43,320
Damon Damon was a goddamn murderer in
the nineties. Oh, I loved her coming up.

13
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,710
But I remember going to the Haha cafe.
Uh,

14
00:00:46,711 --> 00:00:50,370
they would do it like a show every
Tuesday and my friends would run and Damon

15
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,810
Wayans would always drop in and
do an hour and ruin the show.

16
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:56,640
Like he would have no material.

17
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,870
And he would just attack people in the
crowd by the time he was off stage,

18
00:01:00,871 --> 00:01:02,820
like the audience was
furious like they were,

19
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:05,700
they went crazy when he came out and
then by the end they were just like,

20
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:08,400
why is he doing this to us and be like,
we were like,

21
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,890
aw fuck Daymond Wayne's this year.
It was so funny.

22
00:01:10,891 --> 00:01:14,250
Somebody like looked up to as a kid
and like loved you. Just like, aw man,

23
00:01:14,251 --> 00:01:19,210
this asshole again. Wow. That's crazy. I
wonder why he was doing that. I believe.

24
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:22,440
I mean I guess it's probably cause he
couldn't do it at the store anymore. Yeah.

25
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,430
What, how, how many
years ago was this? God,

26
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,080
I mean at least at least 10 1213
years ago. See that puts it. That's,

27
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,330
that makes sense, right,
because that's around 2005 yeah,

28
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,850
that's like probably he
stopped going to the store.

29
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,030
The store probably tightened up the way
they used to because they used to just

30
00:01:39,031 --> 00:01:42,150
let anybody just draw.
Like Eddie Griffin would drop in,

31
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,210
wasn't on the mic,
wasn't on the schedule.

32
00:01:45,211 --> 00:01:49,950
He would drop in at 9:00 PM and get off
stage. At 3:00 AM and that was real.

33
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,410
Yeah. Yeah. That was real
six hours that would kill me.

34
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:59,250
And uh, and then when he was
done he'd be like, who's next?

35
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:05,910
Who's next to you? He didn't six hours.
What's the longest that you've ever done?

36
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,830
I think an hour and 40 minutes.
Maybe a little longer.

37
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:11,664
And I don't remember,

38
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,870
but I think an hour and 40 minutes
probably the longest I've ever done. Yeah.

39
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,440
Yeah. But that's too long. Too Long. Yeah.

40
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,690
An hour and 20 is more than anybody
should ever have to hear you talk. Yeah.

41
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:26,400
And even that, it's like pushing it
and what I like I like, I like to do,

42
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:31,260
when I do like a theater I two an hour
or an hour and 10 and I just want,

43
00:02:31,261 --> 00:02:35,790
I just want to just start and then finish,
just come on,

44
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,150
go ready.
And then for one hour,

45
00:02:39,151 --> 00:02:41,760
I want everything to be tight and concise.

46
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:46,761
And I would way rather have an hour and
10 minutes that people really enjoyed

47
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:50,460
versus an hour and a half where they're
like an hour of it was really funny

48
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:55,200
because then it leaves you with this even
if it's the same hour, that extra time.

49
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:58,410
And I also just think the audience
doesn't want to see more than an hour of

50
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:02,050
comedy. And it's like people were like,
oh I did three hours the other night.

51
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:04,390
Like why the audience must have hated it.

52
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:07,970
Like Chapelle used to drop into
the cellar, he and like Dane Cook,

53
00:03:07,971 --> 00:03:10,330
we're going back and forth.
Like who could do the longer set?

54
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,540
Like ever world record. Right.
They have like world records. Yeah.

55
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:16,030
And then I think Bob Marley
eventually broken or something. Uh,

56
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:17,050
Bob Marley from Maine.

57
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:21,190
I didn't do like two days on stage and uh,

58
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:24,040
but Chapelle was down there
one time and I was like, Oh,

59
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:26,840
I'm gonna go check it out. And it
was like almost unwatchable. Yeah.

60
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,890
Cause it was like the pacing that they
have that you have to do in order to be

61
00:03:29,891 --> 00:03:30,970
on stage dot long.

62
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,360
And he was funny but it would be like
not funny for long stretches then a big

63
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:37,240
punchline and then back into it.
You're like all right.

64
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:41,050
Like the show when Dave was on hiatus,
right.

65
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:45,810
That was when Dave kind of like took time
off a comedy for a long time. He can,

66
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:49,450
I mean kind of like he wasn't doing
specials but I think he was doing like

67
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,710
surprise shows. Like he was always,
always kind of on tour in weird venues.

68
00:03:53,711 --> 00:03:57,700
He's still doing that now. It was not
always doing like big, big giant theaters.

69
00:03:57,701 --> 00:04:01,440
So like he'll just want to book
like a 20 seat room and uh,

70
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,370
make his agents crazy.
Well he's been doing,

71
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,300
he's been doing the lab at the Improv,
that little tiny room, which is what,

72
00:04:07,301 --> 00:04:11,710
50 50 seats maybe. Yeah, he
did it. A Zs did it. That's a,

73
00:04:11,711 --> 00:04:14,440
that's a place where comedy dies.
That little fucked up room.

74
00:04:14,441 --> 00:04:17,590
I have always hated that room. That
room sucks. Every deck on the planet.

75
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,450
When people are like, oh,
you can try new stuff.

76
00:04:19,451 --> 00:04:23,410
It's like I can try the new stuff
in the main room for a good crowd.

77
00:04:23,411 --> 00:04:26,830
Like why do I want to do
this little terrible room?

78
00:04:26,831 --> 00:04:27,880
I don't know why it's even the,
well,

79
00:04:27,881 --> 00:04:32,770
it's a weird one was because the belly
room is perfect. The belly room works.

80
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:37,180
Yeah, but some way, for some reason that
lab seems like why is their comedy here?

81
00:04:37,181 --> 00:04:40,810
What is, why is the door right there? Why
is this treat right there? What is this?

82
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:43,750
Yeah. What is this here? What do you
got going on here? Everything about it.

83
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:45,940
It's bad.
Like I was trying to tell them,

84
00:04:45,941 --> 00:04:49,030
I go and turn that into the comics screen
room like, no, there's good comedy.

85
00:04:49,031 --> 00:04:51,040
Then I'm like, shut your
mouth. You shut your mouth.

86
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,200
You turn that into the comics cream room.
Yeah.

87
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,340
They used to be where the bar was from.

88
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,300
I know they used to be like where
everybody's hanging out before the show.

89
00:04:58,450 --> 00:04:59,590
It was great.
It was great,

90
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:03,460
and he'd go in the other room to go on
stage and you would go from that part to

91
00:05:03,461 --> 00:05:06,580
go on stage. Now everybody goes
from the front door to go on stage,

92
00:05:06,581 --> 00:05:09,850
so you're trapped in that little hallway
and you're like, where are the fuck?

93
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,610
How do I, where do I hide? Yeah.
Yeah. There's nowhere to hide.

94
00:05:12,611 --> 00:05:15,490
That's why I love the store so much
because there's so many places to hide.
