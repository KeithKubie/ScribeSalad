00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
 
in the last video I told you that for

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460
in the last video I told you that for
 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.320
in the last video I told you that for
quadratic function for a quadratic

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:05.330
quadratic function for a quadratic
 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:07.909
quadratic function for a quadratic
function that the change in the change

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919
function that the change in the change
 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.879
function that the change in the change
of Y is constant what I mean that what I

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889
of Y is constant what I mean that what I
 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.440
of Y is constant what I mean that what I
mean by that this is what we did in the

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450
mean by that this is what we did in the
 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.539
mean by that this is what we did in the
last video this was a quadratic this was

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549
last video this was a quadratic this was
 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.420
last video this was a quadratic this was
data from a quadratic function that when

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430
data from a quadratic function that when
 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.170
data from a quadratic function that when
X increased from 1 to 2 y increased by 2

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180
X increased from 1 to 2 y increased by 2
 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.670
X increased from 1 to 2 y increased by 2
that when we increased X from 2 to 3 y

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:24.680
that when we increased X from 2 to 3 y
 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.470
that when we increased X from 2 to 3 y
didn't increase at all it increased by 0

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480
didn't increase at all it increased by 0
 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.470
didn't increase at all it increased by 0
so the change in Y was clearly not

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480
so the change in Y was clearly not
 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.139
so the change in Y was clearly not
constant and then we went from 3 to 4 Y

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149
constant and then we went from 3 to 4 Y
 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.600
constant and then we went from 3 to 4 Y
actually decreased by negative 2 so the

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610
actually decreased by negative 2 so the
 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.119
actually decreased by negative 2 so the
change in Y was not constant but the

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129
change in Y was not constant but the
 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.459
change in Y was not constant but the
change in the changes of Y we had a

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469
change in the changes of Y we had a
 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.799
change in the changes of Y we had a
change in Y of 2 then a change in Y of 0

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809
change in Y of 2 then a change in Y of 0
 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.590
change in Y of 2 then a change in Y of 0
so our change in the change of Y was

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600
so our change in the change of Y was
 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.709
so our change in the change of Y was
negative 2 then we went from a 0 to a

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719
negative 2 then we went from a 0 to a
 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.959
negative 2 then we went from a 0 to a
negative 2 so the change in the change

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969
negative 2 so the change in the change
 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.720
negative 2 so the change in the change
of Y was negative 2 what I want to do in

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730
of Y was negative 2 what I want to do in
 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.000
of Y was negative 2 what I want to do in
this video is show you why that works

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010
this video is show you why that works
 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.910
this video is show you why that works
for a quadratic function and just to

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920
for a quadratic function and just to
 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.680
for a quadratic function and just to
make the math simple I'm gonna pick the

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690
make the math simple I'm gonna pick the
 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.569
make the math simple I'm gonna pick the
simplest of quadratic functions and if

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579
simplest of quadratic functions and if
 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.460
simplest of quadratic functions and if
you have some free time on your hands

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470
you have some free time on your hands
 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.679
you have some free time on your hands
you might try it out for the more

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689
you might try it out for the more
 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.300
you might try it out for the more
general case but I'm going to try to

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310
general case but I'm going to try to
 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.510
general case but I'm going to try to
show you that it works for Y is equal to

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520
show you that it works for Y is equal to
 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.940
show you that it works for Y is equal to
x squared and you could try it later

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950
x squared and you could try it later
 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.789
x squared and you could try it later
with ax squared plus BX plus C and I'm

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799
with ax squared plus BX plus C and I'm
 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.670
with ax squared plus BX plus C and I'm
going to increment X by 1 it this will

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680
going to increment X by 1 it this will
 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.649
going to increment X by 1 it this will
work as long as you increase X by a

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659
work as long as you increase X by a
 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.990
work as long as you increase X by a
constant amount but one makes the math a

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000
constant amount but one makes the math a
 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.960
constant amount but one makes the math a
little bit simpler so let's pick some

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970
little bit simpler so let's pick some
 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.100
little bit simpler so let's pick some
X's so let's pick some X's and I'm going

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110
X's so let's pick some X's and I'm going
 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.480
X's so let's pick some X's and I'm going
to keep things a little bit general so

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490
to keep things a little bit general so
 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.999
to keep things a little bit general so
it's gonna be very abstract an algebraic

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009
it's gonna be very abstract an algebraic
 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.830
it's gonna be very abstract an algebraic
e for a little bit but I think you might

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840
e for a little bit but I think you might
 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.600
e for a little bit but I think you might
find it satisfying and then we'll figure

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610
find it satisfying and then we'll figure
 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.149
find it satisfying and then we'll figure
out our wise given the X so let's say

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159
out our wise given the X so let's say
 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.940
out our wise given the X so let's say
that X is X 1 so when I write this

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950
that X is X 1 so when I write this
 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.770
that X is X 1 so when I write this
little subscript 1 here that means I'm

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780
little subscript 1 here that means I'm
 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.170
little subscript 1 here that means I'm
picking a particular X a particular

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180
picking a particular X a particular
 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.539
picking a particular X a particular
example of the variable X a particular X

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549
example of the variable X a particular X
 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.960
example of the variable X a particular X
in the domain of this function so in

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970
in the domain of this function so in
 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.730
in the domain of this function so in
that situation what's y going to be

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740
that situation what's y going to be
 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.590
that situation what's y going to be
equal to well Y is just going to be

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600
equal to well Y is just going to be
 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.560
equal to well Y is just going to be
equal to X 1 squared let me do that in

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570
equal to X 1 squared let me do that in
 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.160
equal to X 1 squared let me do that in
orange keep the colors consistent X 1

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170
orange keep the colors consistent X 1
 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.030
orange keep the colors consistent X 1
squared

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040
squared
 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.749
squared
now let's say we increment X by 1 so our

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759
now let's say we increment X by 1 so our
 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.720
now let's say we increment X by 1 so our
next one is going to be X 1 plus 1 I'm

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730
next one is going to be X 1 plus 1 I'm
 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.670
next one is going to be X 1 plus 1 I'm
just going 1 above that

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680
just going 1 above that
 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.839
just going 1 above that
over there if this was three this is

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849
over there if this was three this is
 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:16.970
over there if this was three this is
going to be four and this was zero this

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980
going to be four and this was zero this
 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.610
going to be four and this was zero this
is going to be one then this is going to

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620
is going to be one then this is going to
 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.520
is going to be one then this is going to
be x1 plus one squared which is equal to

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530
be x1 plus one squared which is equal to
 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.679
be x1 plus one squared which is equal to
x1 squared plus two x one plus one all

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:30.689
x1 squared plus two x one plus one all
 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:34.429
x1 squared plus two x one plus one all
right let's increase this by one so then

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:34.439
right let's increase this by one so then
 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:38.270
right let's increase this by one so then
we get to x1 plus two if this is 0 this

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280
we get to x1 plus two if this is 0 this
 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.300
we get to x1 plus two if this is 0 this
is 1 this is 2 if this is 10 this is 11

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310
is 1 this is 2 if this is 10 this is 11
 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.379
is 1 this is 2 if this is 10 this is 11
this is 12

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:42.389
this is 12
 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:45.410
this is 12
so then why when we have this x value

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420
so then why when we have this x value
 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.909
so then why when we have this x value
will be x1 plus 2 squared which is equal

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:49.919
will be x1 plus 2 squared which is equal
 

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:57.080
will be x1 plus 2 squared which is equal
to x1 squared plus 4x1 plus 4 let's do

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090
to x1 squared plus 4x1 plus 4 let's do
 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.959
to x1 squared plus 4x1 plus 4 let's do
live into 2 more actually now let's

00:02:59.959 --> 00:02:59.969
live into 2 more actually now let's
 

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:01.399
live into 2 more actually now let's
increase by another one I think you see

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:01.409
increase by another one I think you see
 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:02.270
increase by another one I think you see
what I'm doing

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280
what I'm doing
 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.740
what I'm doing
x1 plus 3 when the Y value and X when X

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750
x1 plus 3 when the Y value and X when X
 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.970
x1 plus 3 when the Y value and X when X
is x1 plus 3 is going to be x1 plus 3

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980
is x1 plus 3 is going to be x1 plus 3
 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.190
is x1 plus 3 is going to be x1 plus 3
squared which is equal to x1 squared

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200
squared which is equal to x1 squared
 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:22.369
squared which is equal to x1 squared
plus 6x 1 plus 9 let's do one more so

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:22.379
plus 6x 1 plus 9 let's do one more so
 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:25.520
plus 6x 1 plus 9 let's do one more so
when X is going to be let's increment it

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530
when X is going to be let's increment it
 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.939
when X is going to be let's increment it
by one more x1 plus four Y is going to

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:28.949
by one more x1 plus four Y is going to
 

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:33.949
by one more x1 plus four Y is going to
be x1 plus four squared which is equal

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959
be x1 plus four squared which is equal
 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:41.780
be x1 plus four squared which is equal
to x1 squared plus eight X 1 plus 16 now

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790
to x1 squared plus eight X 1 plus 16 now
 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.300
to x1 squared plus eight X 1 plus 16 now
given this let's figure out the changes

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310
given this let's figure out the changes
 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.569
given this let's figure out the changes
in Y so let me write here the change in

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579
in Y so let me write here the change in
 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:51.800
in Y so let me write here the change in
Y the change in Y as we increment X by 1

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810
Y the change in Y as we increment X by 1
 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.469
Y the change in Y as we increment X by 1
each time so here the change in Y will

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:54.479
each time so here the change in Y will
 

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:56.780
each time so here the change in Y will
take this point or this Y value minus

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790
take this point or this Y value minus
 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.149
take this point or this Y value minus
this Y value if we take this Y value

00:03:59.149 --> 00:03:59.159
this Y value if we take this Y value
 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:02.229
this Y value if we take this Y value
minus this Y value so from here to here

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239
minus this Y value so from here to here
 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:06.890
minus this Y value so from here to here
our change in Y is going to be x1 x1

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900
our change in Y is going to be x1 x1
 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:13.490
our change in Y is going to be x1 x1
squared plus 2 X 1 plus 1 minus x1

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500
squared plus 2 X 1 plus 1 minus x1
 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.089
squared plus 2 X 1 plus 1 minus x1
squared so these cancel out and we just

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:17.099
squared so these cancel out and we just
 

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:20.779
squared so these cancel out and we just
get 2x1 plus 1 then when we go from this

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:20.789
get 2x1 plus 1 then when we go from this
 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:23.779
get 2x1 plus 1 then when we go from this
point to this point our change in Y is

this going to be equal to this is going
 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.680
this going to be equal to this is going
to be equal to these guys cancel out

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690
to be equal to these guys cancel out
 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.380

those guys cancel out 4 X 1 minus 2 X 1
 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:51.450
those guys cancel out 4 X 1 minus 2 X 1
is 2 X 1 and then 4 minus 1 is 3 so plus

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460
is 2 X 1 and then 4 minus 1 is 3 so plus
 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.710

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:10.560
is 2 X 1 16 minus 9 is equal to is equal
to 7 so plus 7 so our change in Y is

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:10.570
to 7 so plus 7 so our change in Y is
 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:13.170

from here to here is 2x plus 1 right
 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:16.800
from here to here is 2x plus 1 right
there 2 X 1 plus 1 then it's 2 X 1 plus

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:16.810
there 2 X 1 plus 1 then it's 2 X 1 plus
 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:20.700
there 2 X 1 plus 1 then it's 2 X 1 plus
3 then it's 2 X 1 plus 5 and this 2 X 1

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:20.710
3 then it's 2 X 1 plus 5 and this 2 X 1
 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.760
3 then it's 2 X 1 plus 5 and this 2 X 1
plus 7 so what is the change in the

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:23.770
plus 7 so what is the change in the
 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:25.410

increasing I mean and so we're kind of

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:29.470
increasing I mean and so we're kind of
 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:32.600

jumping the gun what is the change

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:32.610
jumping the gun what is the change
 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:38.670

it'll it should still work so hopefully
 

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:05.380
it'll it should still work so hopefully
you found that kind of satisfying
