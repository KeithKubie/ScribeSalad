00:00:20.363 --> 00:00:22.946
(bright music)

00:00:45.675 --> 00:00:47.730
- Welcome to A Conversation with History.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.580
I'm Harry Kreisler, at the Institute

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.230
of International Studies.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.360
Our guest today is Nell Irvin Painter,

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.150
a leading historian of the United States.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.100
She is the Edwards Professor
of American History

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.950
Emerita at Princeton University.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.870
She is the author of many books,

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.120
including Creating Black Americans,

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.150
Standing at Armageddon,
a Grassroots History

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.800
of the Progressive Era, and most recently,

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.350
The History of White People.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.310
Professor Painter, welcome to Berkeley.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.560
Welcome back to Berkeley.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.760
Where you born and raised?

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.130
- That's two different answers.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.180
- [Harry] Yes.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.550
- I was born in Houston
Hospital for Negroes.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.790
And I was raised in Oakland, California.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.050
I consider Oakland my hometown.

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.300
And looking back, how do
you think your parents

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.330
shaped your thinking about the world.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.850
My parents shaped my thinking
about the world fundamentally.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.630
First of all they were,
to the extent that my,

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.580
you know, my mother is no longer living,

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.350
my father is still alive, they
were very liberal, very left.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.350
So I grew up in a pan-African
left wing household

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.080
that didn't accept sort of
conventional standards for women.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.950
And I was always encouraged
to do what I wanted.

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.860
I always felt I was okay.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.123
And that I could.

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.320
- And your father was here at Berkeley?

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.090
- [Nell] Many years, many years.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.410
- And your mother was in
the Oakland public schools.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.900
- Yes, my father was chief
technician of chemistry

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.763
in Lewis Hall, room 19
Lewis Hall for many years.

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.690
And I grew up on the campus actually.

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.410
My mother, for many years,
did not have a career,

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.940
but when she started
her career in the 60s,

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.060
she actually started in the Ed School here

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.460
at the University of California Berkeley,

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.210
and then moved to the
Oakland public schools.

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.210
Both my parents retired in 1982.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.600
And my mother decided she
wanted to do something new.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.053
She started writing books.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.723
- So, so education and the notion of,

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.330
having your eye on achievement
were very important.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.400
- Yes, but I never felt that I had

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.333
to do this, or I had to do that.

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.110
My parents were just very supportive

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.850
of whatever it was that I was doing.

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.750
Which, the older I get, the
more grateful I am for that.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.423
- And what was conversation
like around the dinner table?

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.080
- Well, we did have conversation
around the dinner table.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.610
Most of it I don't remember,
but one moment stands out

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.180
very clearly, and this
would have been about 1952.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.290
And I was reading, we all
read the Oakland Tribune.

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.230
Which in those days was
a very Republican paper.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.000
And it was backing Dwight Eisenhower.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.380
Time for a change, it said.

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.040
And so I said at the dinner table,

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.055
well, it's time for a change.

00:04:00.055 --> 00:04:03.150
(both laugh)

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.480
- That's very good.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.480
So here, I mean, the Bay
Area obviously became

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.930
a center for Afro-American,
Black activism.

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.210
How did that impact you?

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:22.510
- We were not specifically involved.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.910
My father was not a Pullman
porter or anything like that.

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.910
But the whole feeling of the
Bay Area was very progressive.

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.010
And we were very progressive.

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:38.010
So it was more a kind of
atmosphere that I grew up in.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.830
And I am so grateful that my parents,

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.800
my parents married very young.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.750
They married at 19 years old.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.220
And they agreed that they
must get out of Texas.

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.300
And so as soon as they could, they did.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.280
And only once did I go back.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.410
I was not one of those kids who
was sent back in the summer.

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.480
And every now and then I say to my father,

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.300
I'm so glad you left Texas.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.850
And he says, me too. (laughs)

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:07.780
- I laugh because I'm from Texas.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.373
In fact, you're from Houston
and I'm from Galveston.

00:05:12.842 --> 00:05:16.210
A little more about the
influence of your mother.

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.610
You're a great writer.

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.660
And was she an influence there?

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.270
Tell us a little about that.

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:25.950
- My mother taught me to read and write.

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.260
I knew how to read and write
before I went to school.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:34.090
I knew how to read the
Wizard of Oz, to be exact.

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:39.090
And I spent many years in
my youth away from home,

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.010
so my mother was my great correspondent.

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.040
And all those letters, at least for me,

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.350
are in my archive at the
Duke University Library.

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:54.350
So my mother was crucial in
teaching me to enjoy writing.

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.780
I love to write.

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.210
And I'm still writing actually.

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.140
- And later in her life,
she became a writer.

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:06.742
- She did.
- And published a book.

00:06:06.742 --> 00:06:08.930
- She published two books.
- Two books.

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.400
And so you were able to
return the favor to her,

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.523
now being a distinguished historian.

00:06:16.805 --> 00:06:17.680
- Well, more than that.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:18.890
Yeah, more than that.

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:21.640
She inspired me to change.

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.700
You can change after 65.

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:28.700
I was 68, going on 69 when I got my MFA

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.920
from the Rhode Island School of Design.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:35.010
And if I hadn't had my mother's example

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:39.400
of starting anew at 65, I'm
not sure I could have done it.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:44.400
- Now when you were coming,
when you were maturing,

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:50.050
in public school, were
you struck by the dearth

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:54.520
of historical materials
on African-Americans?

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.400
- Absolutely.
- What was the response,

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:00.250
and how did your parents
help you with that?

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:02.440
- Well, I was always a troublemaker.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.833
And I think I'm still
considered a troublemaker.

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.453
But I remember sitting in homeroom,

00:07:12.415 --> 00:07:17.340
and would this have been in
Claremont Junior High School,

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:20.370
and seeing, it was the Henry Ford mural.

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:22.520
You know, where all
the European immigrants

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.410
go in their national
costume, and then they get

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:27.410
in the boiling pot, they become Americans,

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:29.970
and they come out wearing
their suits and ties.

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:33.313
And every week, I sat under that.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.550
And finally I said, how come there are

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:37.680
no black people in there?

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:38.850
And (makes shushing sound),

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:41.410
that is not a good question.

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:43.980
So, you know, all the time, all the time,

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:46.240
I would bump up against
this sort of thing.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:51.240
I was in gifted classes
in junior high school

00:07:51.447 --> 00:07:54.090
and high school, I went to Oakland Tech.

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:57.710
And I was very good in history.

00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:59.440
Actually, I was good in everything.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.100
But I was really good in history.

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:05.073
And we got tested toward the end.

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.860
What's your aptitude and
what's your interest.

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:12.070
And I was like astronomical
on both in history.

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:15.240
And I said, well that
proves that these tests

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:18.500
don't know anything because
I hated history's guts.

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.530
Because I knew it was a pack of lies.

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:23.780
And I said to my teacher,
where is segregation here?

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:25.640
What's going on here?

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.640
I grew up with From Slavery to Freedom.

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:31.080
So I knew that there was stuff there

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:32.843
that I was not being taught, so.

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:39.140
I did not graduate from
Berkeley in history.

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:42.590
I did not, I tested out
of US history on purpose.

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:43.550
I didn't want to take it.

00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:46.180
- And your parents helped,

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:50.680
pointed you toward the black heroines

00:08:52.574 --> 00:08:57.574
and women who, who were not in the books.

00:08:57.980 --> 00:08:59.340
- Not particularly.
- No.

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:00.840
- They encouraged me to read.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.740
They encouraged me to read everything.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:07.560
So, you know, we're talking
way before feminism here.

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:12.350
So they were not pushing me
in any particular direction.

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:14.390
They were, you know, if I had wanted

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:16.460
to become an artist at that time,

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:19.340
I remember my father
saying well, you know,

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:23.030
we're not sure about this because
it was an academic family.

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:24.200
Academic, we know what to do.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.850
Artist, we don't know what to do.

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:29.270
But they would not have
stood in my way if I had,

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:31.323
'cause I drew a lot as a kid.

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:37.420
And I was actually briefly an
art major here at Berkeley.

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:40.133
Until I got my C.

00:09:41.102 --> 00:09:42.010
(both laugh)

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:44.750
- Which may tell us that
academic departments

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:47.230
in art are not the way to go.

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:50.140
- No, I got my C in
sculpture, I earned it.

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:51.930
I did not do any work.

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:54.520
I thought that if you had talent,

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:56.783
because it worked in drawing and painting.

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:01.530
I mean, I knew what to do
in my academic subjects.

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:02.660
And I just did it.

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:06.359
But in sculpture I didn't know
what to do, and I thought.

00:10:06.359 --> 00:10:09.710
- So you come to Cal as an undergraduate,

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:11.461
and what did you major in?

00:10:11.461 --> 00:10:14.900
- I finally graduated in anthropology,

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:17.910
but my honors thesis really
was a history thesis.

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:19.790
It was medieval Europe.

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:22.070
- And you traveled abroad, right?

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:22.903
- I did.

00:10:22.903 --> 00:10:25.340
I was in the first class
of education abroad,

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:28.520
which just celebrated
its 50th anniversary.

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:32.390
- And where, where, where,
where did you go abroad?

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:34.400
- [Nell] Bordeaux, France.

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.620
- And there you got
interested in French history.

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:39.630
- I did, I did.

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:41.670
And French medieval history was one

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:43.993
of my four fields for my doctorate.

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:49.300
- And then, you also went to Africa.

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:50.323
- After I graduated.

00:10:51.616 --> 00:10:54.490
- And all of these, all these places

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:58.800
were opening you up to,

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.450
to the world but also I guess leading you

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:03.460
to broaden your horizons with regard

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:04.470
to what you were going to study.

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:06.940
- Absolutely, absolutely.

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:10.543
And I have said many times,
and I'll still say it.

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:14.440
Those two years in Ghana actually,

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:17.170
if I had not lived in Ghana for two years,

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:20.240
I would be a crazy person, as are so many

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:24.233
of my fellow Americans, because
racism drives you crazy.

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:28.840
- And what about the French experience.

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:32.850
Did that, did that, was that a place

00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:36.850
where you also could
discover black culture

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:39.630
and its legitimacy there?

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:42.790
- No, no there was no black
culture that I discovered.

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:46.730
And I also didn't discover
the big story of Bordeaux

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:49.800
in the early 60s, which is that Bordeaux

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:53.913
is where the kainua and
the what are called aqui,

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:59.320
the French allies in Algeria.

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:06.070
So if I had known, it would
have been a fascinating study.

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:10.200
What I learned there
was just to want to know

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:13.453
about the past of what
I was walking through.

00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:17.800
And so, my way back into history

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.340
was through French medieval history.

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:23.940
I couldn't do it at that point
through American history.

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:26.860
- And then where did you
do your graduate work?

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:30.310
- I did my first graduate work
at the University of Ghana.

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:35.180
I got my MA in African history from UCLA,

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:38.830
and my PhD in American
history from Harvard.

00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:41.220
- And what led you back
to American history?

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:44.810
Did you already have the
bug of thinking about

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:47.570
your people and their history
in the context of America?

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:48.403
- Let's see.

00:12:49.528 --> 00:12:51.380
I just told you about sort of going

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:55.960
through Bordeaux and then Africa.

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:59.550
And I actually went to
Harvard to do African history.

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:03.070
But I got there before
the African historian.

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:08.070
I am awfully unstable,
and I tend to go into

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.640
whatever it is I'm studying.

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:11.990
So I was doing American
history, I thought,

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:14.660
oh, this is different from what I had

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:16.453
brushed up against in high school.

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:19.970
- Students often watch our program,

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:22.180
and I always like to ask the guests,

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:24.210
and in your case as a historian,

00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:26.400
what do you think are the skills

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:29.463
necessary to do history well?

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:33.180
- The first is curiosity.

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:35.130
That is, you have to
want to know something

00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:37.860
you don't already know.

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:40.820
And the second is to have your eyes

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.770
and ears open as you go to the archive.

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:45.603
And read more than once.

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:49.773
One of the books I did,
it's not under my name.

00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:52.870
It's called The Secret Eye.

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:57.090
And it's the diary of
a plantation mistress

00:13:57.090 --> 00:14:00.410
in the Deep South.

00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:05.410
And I read the typescript,
1,380 pages, eight times.

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:08.900
And by reading it and rereading it,

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:13.380
I found how the various comments

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:15.420
over the years worked together,

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:18.010
and how this woman was keeping secrets.

00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:20.640
And I actually discovered
one of the secrets,

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:24.050
which was an outside
family of her husband's.

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:27.440
I did not discover the other
secret that she hid too well.

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.270
Which was her husband's drinking.

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:32.330
But the descendants told me about that.

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:35.030
So know the sources well.

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:38.290
And ask questions that haven't been asked.

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:40.720
And what I find particularly interesting

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:44.980
is to ask new questions of old sources.

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:48.090
- And the new, part of your goal I guess

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:49.880
is to bring a new perspective,

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.910
so you can define those questions.

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:54.590
- I wouldn't say that's a goal.

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:57.080
But that's part of my process.

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:59.180
- What about temperament?

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:01.853
The temperament of a historian.

00:15:03.663 --> 00:15:06.190
Are there certain characteristics?

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:08.060
- Well, I'm not a good example of that.

00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:13.060
Because even though I have
had a very satisfying career,

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:17.000
I have not succeeded as a great historian.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.530
So I don't know how to
succeed as a great historian.

00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:22.940
I am the kind of historian, the only kind

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:24.750
of historian that I could be.

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:28.200
And that is because I love history.

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:33.200
- And I sense that you,
one of your missions

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:40.210
is to educate the public
about the discoveries

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:42.720
that your curiosity has led you to.

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:45.863
- You know, I really haven't had missions.

00:15:45.863 --> 00:15:47.580
(laughs)

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:51.080
The only time I had
missions and had a plan

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:55.770
was when I started art school in 2007.

00:15:55.770 --> 00:16:00.610
And I had a plan that I
wanted to do a BFA and a MFA.

00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:04.260
But before that, I was just
wandering around in the world

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:07.760
asking the questions that interested me.

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:10.940
So, you know, why are white
people called Caucasian?

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:13.790
You know, that's how The
History of White People started.

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:19.490
Creating Black Americans
was a project brought to me,

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:21.250
saying would you like to do this?

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:25.750
But I don't even remember
how it was that I decided

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:28.410
to use Black fine art
as the illustrations.

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:32.240
Perhaps because I was
already drifting that way.

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:35.110
But by and large, I have satisfied myself.

00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:39.860
That's a very selfish way
of producing scholarship.

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:42.513
But that's been my process.

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:48.503
- One of your first major
books was on Sojourner Truth.

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:52.730
How did that work come about,

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:56.363
and tell us a little about her.

00:16:56.363 --> 00:16:57.196
- Yes.

00:16:57.196 --> 00:17:00.310
That's a perfect example of my process.

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:03.963
So I started thinking about it in the mid,

00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:08.370
late 80s or so, long time ago.

00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:12.700
And what had struck me
was that Sojourner Truth

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:17.220
is known in words as
this fiery abolitionist

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:19.190
who's ripping open her bodice

00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:23.160
and telling off people and
all this sort of thing.

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:24.860
Ain't I a woman, which she didn't say.

00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:26.060
She did not say.

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:27.760
Aren't I a woman, she did not say.

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:31.363
But these were, this sort of
fiery persona was the verbal.

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:36.810
The images were this ladylike person,

00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:40.700
sometimes sitting with
pictures of her grandson,

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:43.150
who was in the Union Army.

00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:45.850
Sometimes with her knitting,
which always pleased me,

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:47.263
because I'm a knitter.

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:52.510
And she was a bourgeois,
and she was well-dressed.

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:54.400
So what is going on here?

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:57.030
So what I wanted to do was figure out

00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:02.380
where Sojourner Truth was in that.

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:05.460
And what I discovered was the process

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:07.620
of making and remaking.

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:09.673
So it's Sojourner Truth, A Life.

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:12.930
Where was she, what did she do?

00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:13.970
And the symbol.

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:18.170
What have we, we in the 19th century,

00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:20.450
we at the turn of the 20th century,

00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:23.380
we in the mid-20th
century, what have we made

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:25.370
of her as a symbol.

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:28.580
- And let's tell our audience

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:30.140
a little about her as a person.

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:35.120
She had been a slave in New
York, in New York of all places.

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:40.120
And then through her
revelations and her embrace

00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:46.400
of an evangelical kind of Christianity,

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:50.770
she became an abolitionist
who was nationally known,

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:53.210
met with Lincoln and so on.

00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:56.400
- She, the state of New York,

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:59.410
freed its adult slaves in 1827.

00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:01.610
So, she was legally freed.

00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:03.860
She walked away a year earlier

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:05.810
because she felt her owner had reneged

00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:08.060
on a verbal arrangement they had made.

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:11.400
And she was moving into what were

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:14.090
then called New York Perfectionists,

00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:17.260
people we would call
Pentecostals and evangelicals.

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:19.790
So she was in this group of people

00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:24.053
in Ulster County, and in New York state,

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:26.640
in New York City, sorry.

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:31.640
And during the Millerite
excitement of 1843,

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:35.790
when thousands of Americans
expected the world to end,

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:40.310
she, well the Holy Spirit
spoke to her and said

00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:44.030
you are no longer Van Wagenen.

00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:47.540
You are no longer Isabella, you are truth,

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:49.050
you are Sojourner Truth.

00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:51.640
And so then she started preaching.

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:55.330
And she followed a Millerite network

00:19:55.330 --> 00:20:00.270
up the Hudson River valley,
and ended up in the end

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:03.100
of that year in the fall,
when it started getting cold,

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:05.513
in a place called Florence, which is,

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:10.440
was a center for abolitionists
right there by Northampton.

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:14.170
And it was in Northampton,
Florence and Northampton,

00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:16.620
that she got to know abolitionists,

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:19.170
and found her calling as an abolitionist.

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:24.140
And at that point, we're
talking 1833, 1844 into 1850,

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:28.940
the community of, the
anti-slavery community

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:31.080
was also a feminist community.

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:33.120
So she was right at home.

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:37.330
And she actually dictated her narrative,

00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:42.330
and she set out in 1850,
in 1851 to sell it.

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:47.250
And her marketing strategy you might say

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:51.060
was to visit anti-slavery feminists.

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:53.570
- So, so in a way, in the process

00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:58.500
of writing this book, on the one hand,

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:02.493
you were a traditional
historian telling a narrative,

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:09.600
writing a book, but also
academic articles about her.

00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:15.830
But you were struck by the
importance of the visuals,

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:17.858
which you've already described.

00:21:17.858 --> 00:21:20.550
- Yeah, and that's where it
started with Sojourner Truth.

00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:22.890
Sojourner Truth did not read and write.

00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:25.860
So everything we know of her in text

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:28.030
is mediated by somebody else.

00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:30.950
I mean, this is, mediation is the story

00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:34.530
of everything we know, even for images,

00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:37.070
even for photography, they are mediated.

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:42.070
But especially in terms of
the words for Sojourner Truth.

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:46.550
As you go through the passage of time,

00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:49.483
the word picture of her changes.

00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:55.660
So, the question is, what did
she want us to know of her?

00:21:56.650 --> 00:21:58.820
Well, the answer is in photographs.

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:01.680
So I ended up doing a chapter

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:03.810
on Sojourner Truth's photographs.

00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:06.710
Thank heaven I had access to an excellent

00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:11.050
art history library at Princeton
and took advantage of it.

00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:13.310
So that's where the art started.

00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:18.310
- And so what did you learn
from the pictures about her,

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:21.350
her presentation of self,

00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:24.370
that helped shape your history of her?

00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:29.370
- Well, what I learned from
her self-fashioning visually,

00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:32.820
which she controlled, when
you pay for the photographs,

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:35.380
you decide how you're
going to be photographed.

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:37.980
She decided to wear her nice clothes.

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:42.980
She didn't dress as a slave,
she didn't dress as a worker.

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:46.550
She didn't foreground her wounded hand.

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:50.620
She had wounded a hand
during her enslavement.

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:54.800
If she wanted to present
herself as a pitiable slave,

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:58.100
she could have put her injury up front,

00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:00.470
which is what the Civil War soldiers did

00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:03.000
who were trying to raise
money with carte de visible.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.550
They put their injury right out

00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:08.440
to solicit, you know, donations.

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:13.440
She presented herself as someone
who was proud of herself.

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:19.410
Who was well-dressed, who was composed,

00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:21.803
and interestingly enough,
who wore eyeglasses.

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:24.663
- And so,

00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:30.300
the work becomes really sort of boring in

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:35.300
to find the evidence for the
creation of the narrative

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:38.470
by the historical figure in a way.

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:41.150
So she was writing her own history

00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:46.150
in a way that was different from what

00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:49.070
might have been other images.

00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:50.240
- Yes, yes.

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.950
But she was not writing.

00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:54.720
She was making.
- Making, yeah.

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:56.780
- She was making images.

00:23:56.780 --> 00:24:01.780
And they were very different
from the various versions

00:24:03.089 --> 00:24:04.523
of text narrative.

00:24:05.696 --> 00:24:09.110
- So, when one looks at the titles

00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:14.110
of your work, it seems, as a historian,

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:20.460
part of your challenge is to
find different perspectives

00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:24.220
on the story we tell
ourselves about ourselves.

00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:26.980
- Yeah, I guess my perspective
is a different one,

00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:30.970
because I work out of my own,
my own vision, my own views.

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:35.803
- Right, and so it's
really, and often the,

00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:42.030
on the one hand, it's the
story of marginal peoples.

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:46.500
That is, people that have
been marginalized by society,

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:49.900
and we don't know their
story in the same way,

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:53.010
when you looked at the
posters on the wall in

00:24:54.730 --> 00:24:57.920
elementary and junior high
school and high school,

00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:59.750
there were stories that weren't there

00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:01.100
when you were going to school.

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:01.933
That's right.

00:25:01.933 --> 00:25:05.740
But in this sense, I am a marginal person.

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:08.950
So the way I see the world is going to be

00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:12.050
the way a marginal person sees the world.

00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:16.970
- And what you're finding
is a very rich history

00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:21.130
from a very different perspective

00:25:21.130 --> 00:25:24.700
than let's say the white male historians

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:27.230
that preceded you had done.

00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:30.353
- I don't think the
body writes the history.

00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:36.490
But there have been large blank spots

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:39.610
in historical writing.

00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:43.640
So I think you can say
that there are people

00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:47.290
independent of their bodies who write

00:25:47.290 --> 00:25:50.580
from a black point of view,
not the black point of view,

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:54.633
but a black point of view,
whose bodies are not black.

00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:57.900
Whose bodies may not be female,

00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:02.900
but whose vision is an
open vision in this way.

00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:04.223
So,

00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:08.650
it's not about the body as a body.

00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:12.220
It's about the body as a
way of seeing the world.

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:14.920
Maybe not the body, but the spirit

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:16.493
as a way of seeing the world.

00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:18.463
- And

00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:26.110
in the case of your, your
book on the progressive era,

00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:29.873
sort of the untold stories
of the progressive era.

00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:34.480
Does the history that you find

00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:39.540
resonate with the experiences

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:42.430
that we're going through in our own time?

00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:47.070
It would seem that the,
talking about the marginalized

00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:49.960
people in the progressive era

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:53.970
really resonates with America,

00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:56.320
especially after the crash of 2008.

00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:58.013
- I wrote that book in the 1980s.

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:01.420
And it,

00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:02.930
it was,

00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:06.080
my editor kept wanting me to respond

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:08.130
to historians' controversies.

00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:10.030
To the historiography.

00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:11.980
So I went into the historiography,

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:14.723
and I said, well, what's going on here?

00:27:15.610 --> 00:27:18.520
So, the question of what is going on

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:22.300
is how I got started in the way I wrote.

00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:25.410
And, so there's a lot about taxes,

00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:28.573
and democracy, and plutocracy.

00:27:30.050 --> 00:27:33.573
Because the late 19th century
was that kind of time.

00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:39.150
I thought we were living in
that kind of time in the 80s.

00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:43.550
When I first published the book in 80,

00:27:43.550 --> 00:27:46.410
what, six or something like that,

00:27:46.410 --> 00:27:49.200
it kind of fell flat.

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:51.760
The lefty historians
wouldn't even review it.

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:53.563
It was a non-book.

00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:56.600
Somehow, it has stayed alive.

00:27:56.600 --> 00:28:00.910
It's in a second edition,
a 21st century edition.

00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:05.000
And recently, I got, I got a royalty check

00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:08.110
That was in the four figures!

00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:10.980
This book has finally found its place.

00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:14.580
Because it's about issues
that haven't gone away,

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:17.280
and that people are now seeing

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:20.463
in a way they couldn't
see in the 80s or the 90s.

00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:25.203
- In a way, it suggests to me that,

00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:28.066
reading the body of your work,

00:28:28.066 --> 00:28:31.123
that there's an element in courage.

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.460
In writing about things that may not be

00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:39.007
recognized as important at
the time you're writing.

00:28:39.007 --> 00:28:40.730
And that you sort of have to wait

00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:43.930
until what's going on in the world

00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:46.920
meets the historical
account that you've written.

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:49.770
- I agree with you entirely
about the second part.

00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:52.939
Luckily, I will probably live long.

00:28:52.939 --> 00:28:54.520
(laughs)

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:58.793
but people have often said
to me, you're so brave.

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:00.583
You're so brave.

00:29:00.583 --> 00:29:02.120
And I think, I'm not brave.

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:03.701
I'm just doing what I want to do.

00:29:03.701 --> 00:29:06.041
(laughs)

00:29:06.041 --> 00:29:10.040
- So it's interesting,
because it sort of suggests

00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:15.040
that the opportunity to,
and at the same time to be,

00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:20.043
shall we say idiosyncratic.

00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:24.680
Those two can come together.

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:27.750
And maybe in the long term, it elevates

00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:30.083
society's knowledge about itself.

00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:32.870
- Hopefully, I hope so, I hope so.

00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:36.030
But as you were talking,
the theme that was

00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:38.680
going through my mind,
remember I said earlier

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:42.110
that the older I get, the more
grateful I am to my parents.

00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:46.890
That it's my parents who gave me that,

00:29:46.890 --> 00:29:51.890
that support, and said go ahead and do it.

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:56.220
I don't always look at myself
through other people's eyes.

00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:59.650
Which is a crippling
habit of subaltern people.

00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:02.110
It's very hard not to do.

00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:05.223
But if you do it, you'll
never do anything.

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:10.390
- Talk a little about your parents again,

00:30:10.390 --> 00:30:15.290
because is it that
there was provision for,

00:30:15.290 --> 00:30:18.450
in addition to their individual strengths,

00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:22.380
and their personalities
and their love of family

00:30:24.409 --> 00:30:29.010
is a blessing that comes
with middle class life?

00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:30.093
- Absolutely.

00:30:31.550 --> 00:30:34.410
The fact that we didn't
have to worry about money

00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:36.693
made all the difference in the world.

00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:42.030
- And is this something
that you saw in your

00:30:42.030 --> 00:30:43.820
history of the progressive era,

00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:47.150
that when things get bad, you know,

00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:52.150
the support for that kind of existence

00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:55.260
for more and more people is diminished?

00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:58.610
- I didn't see it so much
in Standing at Armageddon,

00:30:58.610 --> 00:31:01.110
because it's a much more political book.

00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:02.870
Political economy.

00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:05.540
Where I saw it was when I thought about

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:07.540
women and women's history.

00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:12.240
Because over and over again,
the people whose education

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:17.240
gets sacrificed when hard
times hit, it's women.

00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:21.170
And the people who get pulled away,

00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:24.740
or who get killed, or beaten,
or whatever that stands

00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:28.713
in the way of your scholarly
work, say, those are women.

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:35.313
- Did you experience, in becoming

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:42.430
a historian who happens to be a woman,

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:45.600
did you experience

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:48.180
discrimination as you were making

00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:50.700
your way into the profession?

00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:54.700
Because, you know, all of this opening up

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:58.940
for women and for African-Americans
comes during your time.

00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:01.210
- Absolutely, and I count myself

00:32:01.210 --> 00:32:03.673
as very fortunate that I made it through.

00:32:04.570 --> 00:32:07.650
In those days, I'm talking about the 70s,

00:32:07.650 --> 00:32:11.570
as a woman of any background,
you had to have allies.

00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:14.203
And I had allies, I was
very grateful for that.

00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:21.470
But I wouldn't say so much discrimination.

00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:23.533
But it's more the sort of,

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:27.373
the habits that may pass you by.

00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:33.290
The mentoring you may not get.

00:32:33.290 --> 00:32:36.860
The discouragement may come your way.

00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:39.170
That kind of thing.

00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:42.380
And once again, thanks to my parents,

00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:44.410
I have a pretty strong ego.

00:32:44.410 --> 00:32:49.200
But I remember people
who it just got down.

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:52.850
People who didn't get tenure,
people who just got beat up.

00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:56.940
People whose physical health
was not as robust as mine.

00:32:56.940 --> 00:33:00.150
So I'm also blessed I'm very healthy.

00:33:00.150 --> 00:33:04.010
And if I had had say lupus or you know,

00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:05.840
some other kind of crippling disease,

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:08.800
diabetes, I wouldn't have had my life.

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:10.120
- I believe I read somewhere

00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:14.570
that you said that when you
did the Sojourner Truth book,

00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:19.280
you really, psychology
was another dimension.

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:22.490
That is, the psychology of the slave,

00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:24.500
and the psychology of people who have

00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:26.303
been mistreated by society.

00:33:26.303 --> 00:33:29.570
- Yes, yes, absolutely, absolutely.

00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:34.130
And so in that book and in
my Penguin Classic Editions,

00:33:34.130 --> 00:33:35.850
actually, two Penguin Classics,

00:33:35.850 --> 00:33:38.520
one of Incidents in the
Life of a Slave Girl,

00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:40.840
and one of Narrative of Sojourner Truth,

00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:44.310
I stress the psychological side

00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:49.310
of being in a violent
institution such as slavery.

00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:53.390
And social scientists
have studied what happens,

00:33:53.390 --> 00:33:56.620
or not necessarily what is
going to happen to people,

00:33:56.620 --> 00:34:00.510
or what must happen to
people who are the victims,

00:34:00.510 --> 00:34:04.590
or the witnesses, or the
perpetrators of violence.

00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:08.450
But what they're vulnerable to.

00:34:08.450 --> 00:34:12.820
And so we know your risks

00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:15.040
if you're in a violent institution.

00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:18.430
And slavery was a supremely
violent institution.

00:34:18.430 --> 00:34:23.370
- So in a way, with this
idiosyncratic approach,

00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:25.990
and I'm just, this is a word

00:34:25.990 --> 00:34:28.670
that I want to be careful in using,

00:34:28.670 --> 00:34:32.011
but the opening up of opportunity

00:34:32.011 --> 00:34:36.750
and your sensitivity to
these marginalized groups,

00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:41.270
you're able to bring a perspective

00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:45.280
that opens up new areas of history.

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:47.500
- I would hope so, I would hope so.

00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:49.720
- And that, in other words,

00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:54.297
had previously been
ignored, not completely.

00:34:55.590 --> 00:34:59.780
- No, no, I really do belong
to a class of historians.

00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:02.113
- Yeah, who have worked on this.

00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:06.490
Now tell us a little about your book

00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:08.510
Creating Black Americans,

00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:10.830
which I happen to have here,

00:35:10.830 --> 00:35:13.530
and which is a beautiful book.

00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:18.210
But this is a book where
all of your background

00:35:18.210 --> 00:35:22.470
comes together in a way because
you're telling a narrative,

00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:26.010
but you're saying the
narrative is not enough.

00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:29.300
Why not, and what does
that lead you to do?

00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:31.860
- The book has two voices in a sense,

00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:33.400
which you picked up on.

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:35.020
One is the narrative history.

00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:39.600
It is a narrative history
based on scholarship.

00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:42.700
So it's, you know, it's not breastfeeding,

00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:44.980
it doesn't have a point of view.

00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:48.270
It tells you a lot of
stuff you need to know.

00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:50.940
You should be able to read
this book no matter what

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:53.530
your politics, no matter
what your background,

00:35:53.530 --> 00:35:58.133
and feel confident that the
information it purveys is sound.

00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:02.770
On the other hand, many people have dealt

00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:05.420
with African-American history

00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:09.420
in the heart with emotion, with feeling.

00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:11.890
As a historian, I couldn't do that.

00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:15.200
So I let artists do that.

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:18.140
And one of the things
artists have done about--

00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:18.973
- Black artists.

00:36:18.973 --> 00:36:20.320
- Yes, they're all black artists.

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:22.984
That was a conscious decision I made,

00:36:22.984 --> 00:36:24.970
that it's Creating Black Americans.

00:36:24.970 --> 00:36:26.177
So they're all black artists,

00:36:26.177 --> 00:36:29.220
and all the images have
to do with history.

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:32.560
So it's not a history of black art.

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:33.970
It's a certain

00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:38.870
thread in the work of black artists.

00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:41.470
But in some places, you find more

00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:43.370
than one image of a figure.

00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:45.270
Say like Martin Luther King Jr.

00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:48.470
Or Sojourner Truth, or Frederick Douglass,

00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:53.403
to point out that there is
not one stable way of seeing

00:36:54.410 --> 00:36:56.640
people of importance in the past.

00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:59.880
And that they are figures.

00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:04.140
And artists have done
with them as they will

00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:07.420
from their own individual point of view,

00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:09.070
and from the time they were working,

00:37:09.070 --> 00:37:10.660
and what they wanted to show.

00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:14.210
So the images are not this is what

00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:16.000
Frederick Douglass looked like.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.090
You know, no pretense of that.

00:37:18.090 --> 00:37:20.620
This is what one artist said,

00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:22.140
and this is what another artist said.

00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:23.680
This is what I'm doing.

00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:28.230
- So in a way, you're telling us

00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:32.020
that history is about many histories.

00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:35.760
And the opening up of
different perspectives

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:39.700
to bring a larger and
larger narrative together.

00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:44.700
And that artists can contribute
an emotional component

00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:49.857
to our understanding of the past.

00:37:49.857 --> 00:37:52.050
- Exactly, exactly.

00:37:52.050 --> 00:37:56.730
- And so these two, so
there's no rejection

00:37:56.730 --> 00:37:59.240
of the traditional narrative.

00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:04.240
It's really the two perspectives
coming together in one book

00:38:06.070 --> 00:38:07.230
to give a richer history.

00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:08.250
- Yes.

00:38:08.250 --> 00:38:11.040
And at some points, there was
a little bit of difficulty.

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:13.810
Because it, I remember
that I wanted to include

00:38:13.810 --> 00:38:18.350
the work of an artist here,
in Oakland and Berkeley,

00:38:18.350 --> 00:38:21.230
Mary Lovelace O'Neal, marvelous painter,

00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:23.900
but she's an abstract painter.

00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:27.340
And my editor said no, we want this book

00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:30.440
to be used in classes, and
it'll take too much time

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:33.550
for teachers to learn to
talk about abstraction,

00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:36.110
and then to talk to
their students about it.

00:38:36.110 --> 00:38:38.410
So unfortunately, her work did not

00:38:38.410 --> 00:38:40.083
make it into the final book.

00:38:40.930 --> 00:38:43.600
- Now, your most recent book

00:38:44.702 --> 00:38:49.702
is a history of white people basically.

00:38:51.350 --> 00:38:56.350
Now, this is another case in which

00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:02.840
you tell a story from a
surprising perspective.

00:39:02.890 --> 00:39:07.890
I mean, do white people need
to be told their history?

00:39:08.070 --> 00:39:09.337
- Well, if they want to buy the book.

00:39:09.337 --> 00:39:10.170
(laughs)

00:39:10.170 --> 00:39:11.003
- That's right.

00:39:11.003 --> 00:39:13.800
But you're bringing
something to the table.

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:15.300
Talk a little about that.

00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:18.740
I mean, what were you discovering

00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:20.901
in the process of doing this?

00:39:20.901 --> 00:39:23.520
- This was another book that
started with a question.

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:26.170
You remember at the end
of the 20th century,

00:39:26.170 --> 00:39:28.040
there were the wars in Chechnya?

00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:29.860
Which is the Caucasus.

00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:33.273
And I'm thinking why are white
Americans called Chechens?

00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:35.360
And that's where it stated.

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:37.700
Why are white people called Caucasian?

00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:42.160
And so to answer that,
it took many, many pages,

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:43.530
and then I had to set it up.

00:39:43.530 --> 00:39:45.830
And then you can't just
leave people there,

00:39:45.830 --> 00:39:48.050
so it comes to the present.

00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:50.260
But it started to a question.

00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:52.383
And when I first started working,

00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:55.100
I mean, I would get several,

00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:56.130
people would say what are you working on,

00:39:56.130 --> 00:39:58.846
and I'd say, you know, the
history of white people.

00:39:58.846 --> 00:40:00.000
And some people would say
well that's interesting.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.363
And some people would say,

00:40:02.570 --> 00:40:04.863
are you writing it as a black person.

00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:09.163
First I would say I'm
writing it as a historian.

00:40:10.770 --> 00:40:13.010
And then I thought, well, that's kind

00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:15.070
of a stiff-necked answer.

00:40:15.070 --> 00:40:19.513
And I would say I'm
writing it as a white man.

00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:22.694
But before really got to use that answer,

00:40:22.694 --> 00:40:24.130
(Harry laughs)

00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:27.330
people stopped asking
the question in that way.

00:40:27.330 --> 00:40:32.330
So between about 2000, 2001
and 2005, six, seven, eight,

00:40:37.930 --> 00:40:40.330
enough change that I wasn't getting

00:40:40.330 --> 00:40:44.090
that kind of a question
with a hostile edge anymore.

00:40:44.090 --> 00:40:46.480
Every now and then,
somebody will approach me

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:49.980
and say the book is about settling scores,

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:51.860
and I'm gonna get back at white people.

00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:53.477
It's not that at all.

00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:59.600
- And what you wind up
discovering in a way

00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:03.103
is that, say, in the case of Emerson,

00:41:06.688 --> 00:41:09.810
very important figure in American history,

00:41:09.810 --> 00:41:12.210
you see that a white person

00:41:12.210 --> 00:41:14.280
was really just a Saxon, for him.

00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:15.113
- For him.

00:41:15.113 --> 00:41:16.330
No, no, no, no.

00:41:16.330 --> 00:41:18.930
There were different
kinds of white people.

00:41:18.930 --> 00:41:22.000
And one group of white
people who were inferior.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.740
They were white people, but
they were the Celtic race.

00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:29.750
And then the superior white
people were the Saxons.

00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:31.800
- And where did he come down on this?

00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:34.490
- Of course he's a Saxon.
- Right, right.

00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:37.453
So in a way, over time,

00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:42.800
the notion of who is a white person,

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:45.360
we're all in this together,

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:46.833
broadens over time.

00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:52.510
- First of all, things
change, your main point.

00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:54.110
Absolutely, that's the point of the book.

00:41:54.110 --> 00:41:55.930
Things change.

00:41:55.930 --> 00:41:59.500
But what's hard for many
Americans to understand

00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:02.990
is the idea of one great big white race,

00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:07.720
and no subdivisions within
it, that's a creation of,

00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:10.610
basically, the second
half of the 20th century.

00:42:10.610 --> 00:42:14.420
And before that, there
were many white races.

00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:18.640
And we just talked about
Emerson's two, Saxon,

00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:21.100
he had more than two, but the big two.

00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:22.670
I mean, he was in the Boston area.

00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:25.323
The big two were the Celts and the Saxons.

00:42:26.583 --> 00:42:30.960
So it wasn't that Irish
people and Irish-Americans,

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:35.130
or later on, Italian people,
Italian-Americans became white,

00:42:35.130 --> 00:42:37.080
they were always recognized as white.

00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:38.700
The men could vote.

00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:43.500
However, they were inferior
white races for awhile.

00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:46.130
So the terms changed.

00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:51.130
In Emerson's mid-19th
century, it's Saxons.

00:42:51.830 --> 00:42:56.660
By the late 19th century,

00:42:56.660 --> 00:43:01.040
the Irish are kind of getting elevated

00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:04.310
by the southern and eastern Europeans.

00:43:04.310 --> 00:43:06.670
And then there's a new term

00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:09.450
in the early 20th century, Nordic.

00:43:09.450 --> 00:43:12.070
And Nordic is all northern Europeans.

00:43:12.070 --> 00:43:15.460
So the Irish are put in.

00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:16.293
And

00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:22.190
then by the Second World War,

00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:24.780
the Cold War, suburbanization,

00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:28.050
then the Italian-Americans and the Jews

00:43:28.050 --> 00:43:31.700
and the Slavs and everybody,
they're into white.

00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:35.930
So anthropologists of the 40s and 50s

00:43:35.930 --> 00:43:38.130
kept saying no, no, no, there are not,

00:43:38.130 --> 00:43:39.820
there's not more than one white race.

00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:43.820
There's caucasoid, mongoloid and negroid.

00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:46.410
Those are the races, the real races.

00:43:46.410 --> 00:43:48.270
And people keep asking me, you know,

00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:49.472
what are the real races?

00:43:49.472 --> 00:43:50.780
And there aren't any real races.

00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:54.460
You just make it up
depending on who you are,

00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:58.780
to whom you're speaking,
for what purpose, and when.

00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:03.360
- And it's really, the big hurdles become

00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:06.270
when you have to move from what has become

00:44:06.270 --> 00:44:08.700
a larger and larger white category

00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:13.700
to it being inclusive with
regard to Asians and blacks.

00:44:14.530 --> 00:44:17.980
And I get the sense that
you're trying to show

00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:21.135
that we're all in this together in a way.

00:44:21.135 --> 00:44:25.790
That as, just as there have been changes

00:44:25.790 --> 00:44:28.390
within the white race, and the recognition

00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:31.240
of more and more people
as being part of that,

00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:36.240
the same will be true
with regard to Asians

00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:39.300
and to blacks over time.

00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:41.880
That's your idea.
- This is becoming true.

00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:45.350
Until about 2005 or so.

00:44:45.350 --> 00:44:48.060
After the discovery of the human genome,

00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:51.110
you know, we're all 99.99% the same,

00:44:51.110 --> 00:44:56.110
race is a cultural production,
a social construct,

00:44:57.460 --> 00:44:59.630
there's one race, it's the human race.

00:44:59.630 --> 00:45:03.533
And then after that,
we've been re-racializing.

00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:09.640
And so there was an op ed
piece in the New York Times,

00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:13.640
I am a racial profiling doctor,

00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:18.640
and selling a certain heart
medication for black people,

00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:21.690
even though it works
for some white people.

00:45:22.638 --> 00:45:25.520
You know, we are re-racializing.

00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:30.520
I think, I hope that it's
kind of a desperate last gasp

00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:34.580
before we realize that what
makes the big difference

00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:37.770
is opportunities and money

00:45:37.770 --> 00:45:41.073
and power and wealth and so forth.

00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:47.120
And if I ran things, we would
be collecting census data

00:45:47.210 --> 00:45:49.800
and making it available to people

00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:52.283
according to wealth and income,

00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:59.250
less race, more economic status.

00:45:59.250 --> 00:46:03.330
But I can't say where we're going.

00:46:03.330 --> 00:46:07.460
And certainly we're a country
of over 300 million people.

00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:09.633
So we're not all going together.

00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:16.050
- You are now an emerita professor.

00:46:16.050 --> 00:46:21.050
And you didn't take that as
the occasion to really retire.

00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:28.130
But you took it as an
occasion to start over.

00:46:28.130 --> 00:46:29.180
- That's right.
- In a way.

00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:31.780
And let's talk a little about that.

00:46:31.780 --> 00:46:34.840
Because this is really a second career.

00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:39.310
And in the first career,
we've come to understand

00:46:39.310 --> 00:46:43.580
that you felt the narrative needed

00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:48.050
to be complimented by the visual.

00:46:48.050 --> 00:46:51.090
And so now, you've gone back to school.

00:46:51.090 --> 00:46:52.610
Talk a little about that and

00:46:56.100 --> 00:46:59.620
what led you to do that new career.

00:46:59.620 --> 00:47:01.670
- Well, I had,

00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:05.270
I had been in art in the 60s.

00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:07.523
And failed, you might say.

00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:10.750
And then Sojourner Truth pulled me back

00:47:10.750 --> 00:47:13.560
in with the photographs,
and Creating Black Americans

00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:15.430
with the work of black artists,

00:47:15.430 --> 00:47:17.070
and realizing that there was a long

00:47:17.070 --> 00:47:20.193
tradition of black artists.

00:47:21.090 --> 00:47:22.510
I had company.

00:47:22.510 --> 00:47:25.740
My mother starting again at 65.

00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:28.290
You know, you don't have
to just lie down and stop.

00:47:29.890 --> 00:47:34.230
So I started again as an undergraduate

00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:37.110
at Mason Gross School of the
Arts at Rutgers University.

00:47:37.110 --> 00:47:39.550
The state institution, the state

00:47:39.550 --> 00:47:41.900
university out in New Jersey.

00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:46.900
And I did a BFA, I graduated in 2009.

00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:49.960
And then I went to the Rhode
Island School of Design

00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:52.000
and I did a master of fine arts,

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:56.600
both degrees in painting,
and graduated in 2011.

00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:59.440
And then I flopped around
trying to figure out

00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:02.850
how to put the two parts
of my life together.

00:48:02.850 --> 00:48:06.390
Because in art school,
particularly in graduate school,

00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:10.740
they kept wanting to
disappear the historian.

00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:13.800
And I, they wouldn't let
me use text in my painting.

00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:16.660
So I would sneak text in sometimes.

00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:18.610
- Meaning by that, what do you mean

00:48:18.610 --> 00:48:19.790
you would sneak text in.

00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:21.421
- No writing.
- Oh, writing.

00:48:21.421 --> 00:48:23.220
(both laugh)
Into your artwork, okay.

00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:26.000
- Yes, and I actually made one painting

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:27.514
that had a footnote.

00:48:27.514 --> 00:48:30.250
(both laugh)

00:48:30.250 --> 00:48:34.290
Which was so universally despised

00:48:34.290 --> 00:48:36.130
that I painted out the footnote.

00:48:36.130 --> 00:48:38.300
But I now have a piece on my wall

00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:41.063
that's work in progress
that does have a citation.

00:48:42.246 --> 00:48:43.320
And I swear that I'm gonna put

00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:44.883
some footnotes in my paintings.

00:48:46.330 --> 00:48:49.760
In the summer, I did a little book

00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:53.280
that I called Art History Volume 27

00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:56.740
by Nell Painter Ancestral Arts.

00:48:56.740 --> 00:49:00.740
And it's 20 pages including the front,

00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:02.650
and the back, and the cast of characters.

00:49:02.650 --> 00:49:04.100
Otherwise no text.

00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:06.470
And I printed it at Staples.

00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:08.113
And I sent it to my friends.

00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:11.590
And some of my friends are art people,

00:49:11.590 --> 00:49:15.560
and they said you should make
this into a real artist book.

00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:19.320
Which I'm going to do after
I finish here in Berkeley.

00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:23.680
But meanwhile, the Staples
edition has been acquired

00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:28.170
by the Beinecke Rare Book and
Manuscript Library at Yale.

00:49:28.170 --> 00:49:31.600
And they will acquire
the archival version,

00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:33.580
the archival version will also go

00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:36.050
to the Du Bois Institute at Harvard.

00:49:36.050 --> 00:49:40.190
And also to the, now a building,

00:49:40.190 --> 00:49:44.490
National Museum of African-American
History and Culture.

00:49:44.490 --> 00:49:48.130
So that started with a presentation I made

00:49:48.130 --> 00:49:53.130
at the Metropolitan Museum in March 2013,

00:49:53.450 --> 00:49:55.790
where they invited me
and some other people

00:49:55.790 --> 00:50:00.790
to talk about an exhibition
on African Art in New York.

00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:05.577
And I thought, I looked
at what had been done,

00:50:05.577 --> 00:50:06.867
and it was very interesting.

00:50:06.867 --> 00:50:09.360
It was about curators and collectors,

00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:11.853
and the artists you would recognize.

00:50:12.850 --> 00:50:16.260
And I thought, well, what
do I know about this?

00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:19.100
And so the Harlem
Renaissance popped into mind,

00:50:19.100 --> 00:50:24.060
and particularly Alain LeRoy Locke's

00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:26.190
statement about African art being

00:50:26.190 --> 00:50:29.790
the ancestral art for African-Americans.

00:50:29.790 --> 00:50:31.840
So I said I think I'll start there.

00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:34.040
And I actually did research.

00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:39.040
So now, part of my
freedom as a visual artist

00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:42.750
is to do historical research
and then make that visual.

00:50:42.750 --> 00:50:47.750
And I discovered that the
artists did not agree with Locke.

00:50:47.890 --> 00:50:51.310
They said we don't want to be cast

00:50:51.310 --> 00:50:54.540
into a sort of straitjacket
of African art.

00:50:54.540 --> 00:50:57.750
We want to be open to
the art of our times.

00:50:57.750 --> 00:51:02.750
And I also discovered that
the sort of quintessential

00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:07.470
Harlem Renaissance
artists, a man who had done

00:51:07.470 --> 00:51:12.240
the illustrations for the
Survey Graphic Harlem issue,

00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:17.240
and also for the book
New Negro, was German.

00:51:18.750 --> 00:51:23.750
And was very much influenced
by artists like Otto Dix,

00:51:24.690 --> 00:51:28.400
a German post-Expressionist artist

00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:31.410
who I knew and whose work I admired.

00:51:31.410 --> 00:51:36.410
So my visual presentation
brought in new material.

00:51:37.230 --> 00:51:39.270
That was historical material.

00:51:39.270 --> 00:51:41.883
But, the little book I
made didn't have words.

00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:47.240
- And it was a collection of
these works of art by others?

00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:50.310
- No, I made the art.

00:51:50.310 --> 00:51:52.481
- Oh, you made the art.
- I made the art.

00:51:52.481 --> 00:51:53.807
- Okay, all right, okay.

00:51:53.807 --> 00:51:57.910
And you have in mind
to do a book on beauty.

00:51:57.910 --> 00:51:58.743
I saw somewhere.

00:51:58.743 --> 00:52:00.500
- I did, I did.

00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:03.600
And I had a contract
that I went to art school

00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:07.580
between signing the contract
and giving them the book.

00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:09.463
And so I remade the book.

00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:15.480
Into a book that was as much
image, as my images, as text.

00:52:16.310 --> 00:52:19.980
And I gave it to my agent and my editors,

00:52:19.980 --> 00:52:22.183
and they all said. (gasps)

00:52:23.110 --> 00:52:23.943
No book.

00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:29.820
- So what have you learned
from your work in art

00:52:34.111 --> 00:52:36.893
that moves you beyond
all your work in history.

00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:39.060
- Golly.

00:52:39.060 --> 00:52:40.710
I love both.

00:52:40.710 --> 00:52:44.030
And now I know I don't have to choose.

00:52:44.030 --> 00:52:48.760
But with the art, because
there's such a range

00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:54.600
of eyes looking at the work, I
do much more pleasing myself.

00:52:59.690 --> 00:53:01.610
I haven't quite, maybe I haven't found

00:53:01.610 --> 00:53:04.160
my audience as an artist yet.

00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:05.390
I'm not sure.

00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:10.390
But I feel much less certain
about what I'm doing,

00:53:10.750 --> 00:53:14.110
and end up simply doing what I want to do.

00:53:14.110 --> 00:53:16.780
I guess you could say
that's how I did history.

00:53:16.780 --> 00:53:21.200
But I knew, I knew the
standards in history.

00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:26.100
I knew, I knew when my work
was good historical work.

00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:29.540
I don't know exactly
when my work is good art.

00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:31.400
And it may not be good art.

00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:35.050
But one of the great
things about being old

00:53:35.050 --> 00:53:36.733
is it's okay.

00:53:38.806 --> 00:53:43.130
- And how would you characterize
your art for an audience?

00:53:44.470 --> 00:53:48.346
I know you have a website
and I saw some of it there.

00:53:48.346 --> 00:53:51.950
But what is its current direction?

00:53:51.950 --> 00:53:54.140
- Well, the current work
is not on the website,

00:53:54.140 --> 00:53:58.900
it's on a website of a
gallery in Newark, New Jersey

00:53:58.900 --> 00:54:02.740
where I live called City
Without Walls, CWOW.

00:54:02.740 --> 00:54:06.320
So if you go to CWOW and
look for me under artists,

00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:08.740
you'll find more recent work.

00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:12.550
But my work is digital and manual,

00:54:12.550 --> 00:54:16.750
so what I will be showing in my

00:54:16.750 --> 00:54:21.750
presentation, the Jefferson
Lecture is digital collage.

00:54:21.830 --> 00:54:24.260
And it was digital collage that I made

00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:25.840
for this little art history book

00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:28.650
and will make for the
bigger art history book.

00:54:28.650 --> 00:54:33.010
I also do self portraits
because I don't mind

00:54:33.010 --> 00:54:37.200
how I look in my work, and
I'm also always present.

00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:40.740
So I'm a very handy model in that way.

00:54:40.740 --> 00:54:45.360
And then I do, I do paintings
that are literally paintings.

00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:47.210
So the manual side.

00:54:47.210 --> 00:54:51.840
When I paint manually, I work
on paper and I work on canvas.

00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:56.610
And I use, I use acrylics,
some of them are heavy bodied.

00:54:56.610 --> 00:55:01.373
More and more I use very light
bodied inks, acrylic inks.

00:55:02.820 --> 00:55:04.700
- And one final question.

00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:09.253
Looking back on your amazing career,

00:55:10.550 --> 00:55:13.920
what lessons might students who watch

00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:18.843
this interview learn from your odyssey?

00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:26.880
- Well, I don't know if my
odyssey applies to other people.

00:55:26.900 --> 00:55:31.900
Because I consider myself a
uniquely fortunate individual.

00:55:34.050 --> 00:55:35.820
Very blessed.

00:55:35.820 --> 00:55:38.060
But I would say to others

00:55:39.590 --> 00:55:42.410
do what you want to do and do your work.

00:55:42.410 --> 00:55:44.633
Do a lot of work.

00:55:45.510 --> 00:55:47.950
- Well, on that note, Professor Painter,

00:55:47.950 --> 00:55:50.120
I want to thank you for coming to Berkeley

00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:53.160
to be the Jefferson lecturer
and to be on our program.

00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:54.270
- Thank you.

00:55:54.270 --> 00:55:56.330
- And thank you very much for joining us

00:55:56.330 --> 00:55:58.913
for this conversation with history.

00:55:58.913 --> 00:56:01.496
