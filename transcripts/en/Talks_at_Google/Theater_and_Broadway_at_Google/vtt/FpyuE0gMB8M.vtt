SPEAKER: Without
any further ado,

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.215
we'd like to welcome
the cast of Imbible.

00:00:10.215 --> 00:00:10.715
[CHEERING]

00:00:10.715 --> 00:00:13.190
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:23.970
KATE HOOVER: [SINGING] By the
waters, the waters of Babylon.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:33.260
We lay down and wept
and wept for the Zion.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:44.421
We remember, we remember,
we remember thee Zion.

00:00:44.421 --> 00:00:46.385
ANTHONY CAPORALE:
In the beginning,

00:00:46.385 --> 00:00:50.200
God created the
heavens and the earth.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.437
The earth was without
form and void.

00:00:53.437 --> 00:00:56.850
And darkness was upon
a face of the deep.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.680
And the spirit of God was moving
over the face of the waters.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.240
And God said, let
there be a firmament

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.352
in the midst of the waters.

00:01:06.352 --> 00:01:11.200
And let it separate the
waters from the waters.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.750
And God made the firmament
and separated the waters

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.620
which were under the firmament
from the waters which

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.810
were above the firmament.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.050
And it was good.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.000
And God said, let the
waters under the heavens

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.124
be gathered together
into once place.

00:01:28.124 --> 00:01:32.700
And let the dry land appear.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.195
And it was good.

00:01:35.195 --> 00:01:38.846
God called the dry land earth.

00:01:38.846 --> 00:01:41.100
And the waters that were
gathered together he

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.280
called seas.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.060
A mist went up from
the earth and watered

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.355
the whole face of the ground.

00:01:50.355 --> 00:01:53.630
And it was good.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.600
And God said, let the
waters bring forth

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.180
swarms of living creatures.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.370
So God created every
living creature

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.680
with which the
water swarms saying,

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.800
be fruitful and multiply
and fill the waters.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:16.870
And it was not so
good, actually.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.490
At least, wasn't so good for us.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.380
Noah was the first
tiller of the soil.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.620
He planted a vineyard
and drank of the wine

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.720
and became drunk and lay
uncovered in his tent.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.390
See, even back then
drunk equaled naked,

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.520
but we'll get to that.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.105
Let's switch from
Noah to Pasteur now,

00:02:44.105 --> 00:02:45.980
because we've got a lot
of science coming up.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.630
And if we stay on
this path, it's

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.770
going to take a Jewish
carpenter to get us wine,

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.030
and I'm pretty sure that's not
who they use in Napa Valley.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.770
Wine, as it turns
out, is generally

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.980
not made by messianic
prophets but by yeast.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.320
Yeast-- a unicellular
microorganism that's

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.880
part of the fungi kingdom.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.520
And folks, it's
everywhere-- in the air,

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.890
living on plants,
even on your skin.

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.140
But don't worry,
it's mostly harmless.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.020
It can be a bit itchy if
it gets in the wrong nooks

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.932
and crannies.

00:03:18.932 --> 00:03:20.390
You can laugh at
that, it's Friday.

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.286
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:22.286 --> 00:03:25.520
Yeast is pretty single-minded
as unicellular microscopic fungi

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.030
go.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.488
Pretty much does
one thing in life.

00:03:27.488 --> 00:03:32.460
It eats sugar and excretes
alcohol and carbon dioxide.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.580
Now, the only thing it
asks is that the sugar

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:41.480
be dissolved in water, and
that really is the beginning.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.840
Come back with me now to
the days of the cavemen.

00:03:47.974 --> 00:03:50.770
Now, you think yeast
leads a simple life?

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:56.090
Pretty much all these guys did
was eat, sleep, and try and not

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.884
die.

00:03:57.884 --> 00:03:59.300
Because back then,
the eating part

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.930
took up all of your free time
if you wanted to not die.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:04.970
Meat was a real bitch.

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.810
You had to hunt the mammoth
while trying to not die.

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.720
Kill the mammoth definitely
trying to not die.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.470
Drag the carcass back to your
cave still trying to not die.

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.589
Clean it, cook it, all
of which could easily

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:20.810
use more calories than
you got from the meal

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.190
and was a little stressful.

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.440
So mostly we ate
plants, but even those

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.710
can be a real pain
in the grass to find,

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.970
till we learned to grow them
where we wanted them to be.

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.650
But eventually,
we did just that,

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.500
and the first plants
we were able to farm

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.040
were the most common.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.450
The grasses, things like
wheat and rye and barley.

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:39.470
The cereal grains.

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.000
Once we had a
handle on those, we

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.958
could start making the
stuff of life-- bread.

00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.710
Ooh.

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.340
So back to our cavemen.

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.660
And by the way, these
were totally not cavemen.

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:51.920
ALL: What?

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.530
ANTHONY CAPORALE: No, it just
makes for a much cooler story.

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.840
We're probably in the
early Neolithic period,

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.960
around 9,500 BC.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.500
He is out gathering wheat to--

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.650
sorry, more likely she--

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.160
is out gathering wheat to
make bread, when suddenly--

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.400
[THUNDER]

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.766
--a thunderstorm rolls in.

00:05:13.766 --> 00:05:15.780
Now, remembering that
her first husband once

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.850
got caught in a
thunderstorm and that's

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.510
what cleared the way
for her second husband,

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.030
she drops the half
full basket of wheat

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.810
and hightails it
back to her cave.

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.440
And when the weather
clears up, she

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.370
goes back to gathering wheat
and comes upon the basket

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.090
she left in the rain.

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:35.340
NICOLE DIMATTEI: Look at that.

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:36.330
ANTHONY CAPORALE:
It's been a few days,

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:37.871
and the sugars in
the grain have been

00:05:37.871 --> 00:05:41.250
dissolved by the rainwater
that's collected in the vessel.

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.490
Unbeknownst to our heroine,
the yeast living on the wheat

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.250
has been happily
doing its thing.

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.140
Grain looks different.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.010
Kind of soupy and bubbly.

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:53.240
Smells different too.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.120
Sharp but a bit sweet.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.560
So she tastes it.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.300
Not too bad.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.023
Not great, but not bad.

00:06:03.023 --> 00:06:05.238
[SNICKERING]

00:06:06.245 --> 00:06:08.970
And then, for some
reason, she has the urge

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:10.080
to take off her top.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.034
NICOLE DIMATTEI: Woo!

00:06:11.034 --> 00:06:12.450
ANTHONY CAPORALE:
And she realizes

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:13.410
she's not wearing a top.

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:13.920
NICOLE DIMATTEI: What?

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.150
ANTHONY CAPORALE: Doesn't
really know what a top is.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:15.810
NICOLE DIMATTEI: Whatever.

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:17.268
ANTHONY CAPORALE:
So it's all good.

00:06:17.268 --> 00:06:21.060
And off to the cave she goes
with her growler of beer--

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:21.977
NICOLE DIMATTEI: Whoa!

00:06:21.977 --> 00:06:23.393
ANTHONY CAPORALE:
--because that's

00:06:23.393 --> 00:06:25.080
what she's just discovered.

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.119
NICOLE DIMATTEI: I'm awesome.

00:06:27.119 --> 00:06:28.660
ANTHONY CAPORALE:
Cheers, my friends,

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:32.010
and welcome to The
Imbible at Google.

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:33.501
[CHEERING]

00:06:33.501 --> 00:06:34.992
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:34.992 --> 00:06:36.490
NICOLE DIMATTEI: 1, 2, 3.

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:38.865
ALL: [SINGING] Beer, beer,
beer, tiddly beer, beer, beer.

00:06:38.865 --> 00:06:40.698
ANTHONY CAPORALE:
[SINGING] A long time ago,

00:06:40.698 --> 00:06:43.080
way back in history, when
water was the only drink as far

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.111
as the eye could see, along came
a lass by the name of Carley

00:06:46.111 --> 00:06:46.610
Jane--

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:47.270
KATE HOOVER: That's me!

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:48.310
ANTHONY CAPORALE: --and she
invented a wonderful drink

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:49.540
and she made it out of grain.

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.664
ALL: [SINGING] Oh, she
could have been a cavewoman,

00:06:51.664 --> 00:06:52.980
a goddess, or queen.

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:56.000
And to sing her praises
we are always keen.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.530
Oh, look what she
has done for us,

00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:58.910
she's filled us up with cheer.

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:01.410
A'Lord bless Carley
Jane, the lass

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:05.130
who invented beer, beer,
beer, tiddly beer, beer, beer.

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:08.450
The Jury's Pub and The Stag,
The Wexford Inn as well.

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:11.100
One thing you can be sure of,
it's Carley's drink they sell.

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:14.150
So all you lads and
lasses at 11 o'clock

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:17.829
refrain, for 5 short seconds,
remember Carley Jane.

00:07:17.829 --> 00:07:18.870
NICOLE DIMATTEI: Stop it.

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:21.354
ANTHONY CAPORALE: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:07:21.354 --> 00:07:23.770
ALL: [SINGING] She could have
been a cavewoman, a goddess,

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:24.860
or a queen.

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:28.570
And to sing her praises
we are always keen.

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:32.090
Look what she has done for us,
she's filled us up with cheer.

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:34.290
A'Lord, bless Carley
Jane, the lass

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:38.084
who invented beer, beer,
beer, tiddly beer, beer, beer.

00:07:38.084 --> 00:07:40.115
A bushel of malt,
a barrel of hops,

00:07:40.115 --> 00:07:42.850
stirred around with
sticks, the type

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:47.190
of irrigation to make your
[INAUDIBLE] 40 pints of wallop

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:49.010
will keep away the quacks.

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:52.850
It's only ha'pence a penny
a pint and 1 and 6 in tax.

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:55.820
ANTHONY CAPORALE:
Everybody sing with us.

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:59.580
ALL: [SINGING] 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:04.090
She could have been a cavewoman,
a goddess, or a queen.

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:05.090
NICOLE DIMATTEI: Louder!

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:09.790
ALL: [SINGING] And to sing her
praises we are always keen.

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:14.530
Look what she has done for us,
she's filled us with cheer!

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:18.430
A'Lord bless Carley Jane,
the lass who invented beer!

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:22.750
Beer, beer, beer,
tiddly beer, beer, beer.

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:24.870
A'Lord bless Carley Jane!

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:26.040
KATE HOOVER: Woo!

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:26.540
Yeah!

00:08:28.969 --> 00:08:30.510
ANTHONY CAPORALE:
Good job, everyone.

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:32.909
Nicely done.

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:34.720
I love that song.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:35.950
What was I talking about?

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:37.320
Oh.

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:42.240
Cereal grains plus water
plus yeast equals beer.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.490
But you don't need to limit
yourself to cereal grains.

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:46.710
Grape juice, which
already has water in it,

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:48.540
plus yeast equals--

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:49.165
AUDIENCE: Wine.

00:08:49.165 --> 00:08:50.123
ANTHONY CAPORALE: Yeah.

00:08:50.123 --> 00:08:52.660
Just shout them right out if
you know the answers, folks.

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:53.160
All right.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.500
What if we start with
the juice of palm fruits

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:56.810
like apples or pears?

00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:58.380
Any one?

00:08:58.380 --> 00:08:59.130
AUDIENCE: Cider.

00:08:59.130 --> 00:08:59.280
ANTHONY CAPORALE: Yeah.

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.155
You can google these.

00:09:00.155 --> 00:09:02.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:02.610
Cider.

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:03.150
Very good.

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:04.566
I'm gonna make it
a little harder.

00:09:04.566 --> 00:09:07.865
How about if we dissolve
honey in water and add yeast?

00:09:07.865 --> 00:09:08.490
AUDIENCE: Mead.

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:08.850
ANTHONY CAPORALE: Yeah.

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:09.870
There we go.

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:10.960
All right.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.800
I like it when the
crowd gets mead.

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:16.930
Let's keep an eye on this
and see what happens.

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:20.310
So to generalize my
original statement, sugar

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:24.600
plus water plus
yeast equals alcohol,

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.150
or as I like to write
it, ethyl alcohol

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:30.540
equal sugar plus
water plus yeast.

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:33.662
I call this the alcohol
sugar equivalent formula,

00:09:33.662 --> 00:09:35.370
and it demonstrates
the same relationship

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:38.790
between sugar and alcohol that
Einstein's equivalence formula

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:40.200
demonstrates between energy--

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.230
I am serious.

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:43.800
No, look.

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:44.790
Think about it.

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:46.890
Einstein's formula
shows that mass can be

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:48.600
converted into energy, right?

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.930
The more mass you start with,
the more energy you get.

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:54.810
Well, my equation
shows that sugar can be

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:56.880
converted into ethyl alcohol.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:01.770
The more sugar you start with,
the more alcohol you get.

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:04.290
I would argue that my
equation has had a greater

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:08.140
impact on human history.

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:10.020
In fact, I would go
so far as to say that

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:12.840
the discovery of fermentation--

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:16.380
this process of converting
sugar into alcohol using yeast--

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:18.750
has been more important to
the evolution of our species

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:22.152
than the discovery of fire.

00:10:22.152 --> 00:10:22.860
I would be wrong.

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:27.430
Like, way wrong.

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:29.370
But I would certainly say that.

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:31.560
Maybe after a few drinks I will.

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.330
Here's why.

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:37.680
Alcohol is toxic.

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:38.770
But you knew that.

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:41.040
It's right in the word.

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.724
In--

00:10:42.724 --> 00:10:43.670
AUDIENCE: --toxicated.

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:46.220
ANTHONY CAPORALE:
--toxicated, yes.

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:49.340
It's toxic to us in
surprisingly small doses.

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:51.860
What is the legal
blood alcohol limit

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:53.520
to drive in New York state?

00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:00.530
I'm not going to
use the joke again.

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:01.375
Who knows?

00:11:01.375 --> 00:11:02.000
AUDIENCE: 0.08.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:02.540
ANTHONY CAPORALE: There you go.

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:03.040
Good.

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:05.600
If you didn't know that, when
we're done with the show,

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:09.917
then I need to download
an app called Uber.

00:11:09.917 --> 00:11:11.000
Look at this number folks.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.250
Look.

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:15.730
That is not 8%.

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:16.230
Right?

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:18.050
It's not 8/10ths of a percent.

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:21.140
It's 8/100ths of a percent.

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:26.530
That's one part in every 1,250.

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:29.900
If 8/100ths of 1% of your
blood is ethyl alcohol,

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:31.194
you are too in--

00:11:31.194 --> 00:11:32.110
AUDIENCE: --toxicated.

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:35.390
ANTHONY CAPORALE:
--toxicated to legally drive.

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:40.940
At just over one half of 1%,
you go into a coma and die.

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:41.712
So yeah.

00:11:41.712 --> 00:11:42.420
Alcohol is toxic.

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:44.510
Fun fact.

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:46.700
But here's the coolness.

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:49.070
It's not just toxic to us.

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:50.960
It's toxic to lots
of other things

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.870
as well, including some
pretty nasty stuff,

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:56.990
like bacteria and fungi.

00:11:56.990 --> 00:12:01.530
Plus, it can inactivate
viruses, which is a nice bonus.

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:04.820
And if alcohol is
toxic to our big asses

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:07.377
in quantities as
small as 1/2 of 1%,

00:12:07.377 --> 00:12:08.960
how much alcohol do
you think it takes

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:14.100
to kill a teensy-weensy
little bacterium?

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:17.020
Not too much is
the correct answer.

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:19.990
And this is why I say that
the discovery of fermentation

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:22.260
and our resulting ability
to produce this incredibly

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:26.910
effective disinfecting
agent, incredibly

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:31.710
easily, from incredibly
common ingredients,

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:35.700
has quite literally allowed the
human race to survive attacks

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:39.000
that would have otherwise
neatly killed us off--

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.330
and ultimately, go on
to invent cool stuff

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:46.595
like iPhones and twerking.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.100
Anyway.

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:52.741
It didn't take too long for our
cavewoman to figure this out.

00:12:52.741 --> 00:12:54.990
When she brought that first
growler back to her people

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:56.740
and they started
drinking the beer inside,

00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:58.000
they noticed a few things.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.260
First, the people who drank
the bubbly grain juice

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:07.010
tended to not die as much as
the people who just drank water.

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:09.120
Remember, be fruitful
and multiply.

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:12.030
Fill the waters.

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:16.130
Ever hear, don't
drink the water?

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:21.860
Folks we have a Rover on Mars,
right now, looking for life.

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:23.390
But is it actually
looking for life,

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:25.411
like little green martians?

00:13:25.411 --> 00:13:25.910
No.

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:26.630
What's it looking for?

00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:27.330
AUDIENCE: Water.

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:27.710
ANTHONY CAPORALE: Water.

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:28.760
Very good.

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:31.030
And what did we just find?

00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:31.580
Water.

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:34.520
Now, why are we so excited?

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:37.790
Because water is
the key to life.

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:40.700
Tons of things live in water.

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:43.700
Disease causing
agents love water.

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:46.270
And we can't live without it.

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:49.350
So let's fast forward a bit
from our clever cavewoman

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:55.740
and drop in on her progeny,
about 10,000 years later.

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:57.750
People have gotten really
good at getting plants

00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:59.310
to grow where they want.

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:02.370
They've gotten somewhat
less good, but still better,

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:06.660
at not dying, in large part
because they've been gathering

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:08.610
together in bigger and
bigger groups centered

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:12.320
around these farms for a
few thousand years now.

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.940
We are in the midst of an
agricultural revolution,

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:17.430
with its resulting
rise in cities.

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:19.452
ALEC LEE: Taxi!

00:14:19.452 --> 00:14:21.660
ANTHONY CAPORALE: And twerking
is looming ever closer

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:23.730
on the horizon.

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:26.010
Now, cities have lots
of upside, right?

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:29.790
There's easy access
to food, protection

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:35.310
from outside invaders,
truly outstanding

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:39.480
Off-Broadway musical
communities with cocktails.

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.310
They also pose some problems.

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:44.040
Where do we usually
build cities?

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.992
Hint-- we have one on each
side of us at this very moment.

00:14:46.992 --> 00:14:47.700
AUDIENCE: Rivers.

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:48.620
ANTHONY CAPORALE:
Rivers, very good.

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:50.130
Can't live without water, right?

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:52.380
But we also use these rivers
for lots of other things,

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:59.310
like washing, transportation,
waste disposal,

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:02.070
trapping people in New Jersey
if they don't endorse you

00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:04.710
in an election.

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:07.500
Very versatile, these rivers.

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:13.430
ALL: [SINGING] Down
by the old mill stream

00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:15.285
where I first met you.

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:25.280
With your eyes of blue,
dressed in gingham too.

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:38.350
It was there that I knew
that you loved me too.

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:44.920
You were 16.

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:45.485
Sweet 16.

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:52.042
ANTHONY CAPORALE:
[SINGING] My village queen.

00:15:52.042 --> 00:15:53.340
ALL: [SINGING] Village queen.

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:57.560
By the old mill stream.

00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:10.270
By the old mill stream.

00:16:13.252 --> 00:16:14.743
Mill stream.

00:16:19.286 --> 00:16:21.500
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:24.140
ANTHONY CAPORALE:
Thank you very much.

00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:26.060
And it's a great system.

00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:28.060
Clean water flows
up to the city.

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:36.440
The inhabitants use it to drink,
cook, clean, fill up bongs.

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:38.360
Then they throw the
waste out into the street

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:42.590
where it runs back down to
the river and is carried away.

00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:44.390
Perfection.

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:46.670
Unless you live in a city
downstream from, say,

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:50.660
London in which case your
H2O is a veritable Petri

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:54.740
dish of living goo, courtesy
of the folks upstream.

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:57.890
So as fast as we were
filling up these cities,

00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:02.300
we were filling up the
cemeteries even faster.

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:07.710
ALL: [SINGING] Ring around the
rosie, a pocket full of posies,

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:13.526
ashes, ashes, we all fall down.

00:17:13.526 --> 00:17:15.109
ANTHONY CAPORALE:
Now, a lot of people

00:17:15.109 --> 00:17:19.681
think that song was
written about the plague.

00:17:19.681 --> 00:17:21.094
ALL: Ohh.

00:17:21.094 --> 00:17:22.010
ANTHONY CAPORALE: Yep.

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:24.319
The rosy red welt with
a circle around it

00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:25.745
caused by the bacteria.

00:17:25.745 --> 00:17:27.584
ALL: Ohh.

00:17:27.584 --> 00:17:29.750
ANTHONY CAPORALE: Stuffing
your pockets with flowers

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:32.090
to combat the stench of decay.

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:34.040
ALL: Gross.

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:38.552
ANTHONY CAPORALE: And
burning the dead to ashes.

00:17:38.552 --> 00:17:39.635
KATE HOOVER: Jesus Christ.

00:17:42.929 --> 00:17:45.220
ANTHONY CAPORALE: Those lyrics
were likely added later.

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:47.320
It's pretty clear that
life wasn't quite as safe

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:49.770
as houses around this time.

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:53.960
But take some of that
pestilence-laden river water,

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:56.570
add a little of our
bubbly grain juice,

00:17:56.570 --> 00:18:02.060
suddenly all those
nasty pathogens die off.

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:04.440
So you're cavewoman's--

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:07.000
I don't know-- great great
great great granddaughter,

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.900
still try really
hard to not die.

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:13.780
Don't drink the water.

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:17.630
Drink the beer.

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:19.300
You guys got some
beer coming, right?

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:19.841
SPEAKER: Yes.

00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:22.510
There it is.

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:24.090
ANTHONY CAPORALE:
What kind is it?

00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:25.339
SPEAKER: Oh, it's right there.

00:18:25.339 --> 00:18:27.880
But our keg has arrived.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:30.830
ANTHONY CAPORALE: Oh, great.

00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:33.870
Fantastic.

00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:35.429
Guys?

00:18:35.429 --> 00:18:36.637
ALEC LEE: [SINGING] Spiritus.

00:18:42.502 --> 00:18:49.422
Spiritus sanctus.

00:18:49.422 --> 00:18:50.755
KATE HOOVER: [SINGING] Spiritus.

00:18:55.510 --> 00:19:01.265
Spiritus sanctus.

00:19:01.265 --> 00:19:04.610
NICOLE DIMATTEI: [SINGING]
Spiritus sanctus.

00:19:08.869 --> 00:19:10.410
ANTHONY CAPORALE:
By the Middle Ages,

00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:12.360
people were drinking
low alcohol,

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.880
small ale as an everyday drink.

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:17.520
Now, the small ale was packed
with vitamins and minerals.

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:19.770
It was really liquid
bread, after all.

00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:24.510
And at about 2% or 3%
ABV, or alcohol by volume,

00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:28.160
had just enough ethanol
to kill off any bad stuff.

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:31.920
That's what everybody drank,
including pregnant women

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:34.337
and children.

00:19:34.337 --> 00:19:35.170
Just think about it.

00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:38.320
Would you rather your
kid catch a little buzz

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:39.400
or die of cholera?

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:45.260
I mean, I guess it
depends on your kid.

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:49.310
Look, small ale was just part
of a balanced breakfast, folks.

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:52.400
Laborers would drink gallons
of the stuff every day

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.800
while they were sweating
away their electrolytes.

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:57.500
It was the original
sports drink, really.

00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:00.814
So score one for ethanol,
which, as I mentioned,

00:20:00.814 --> 00:20:02.480
is the alcohol we've
been talking about.

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:05.870
Ethanol, or ethyl alcohol, is
the type of alcohol we drink.

00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:07.370
Now, there's lots
of other alcohols.

00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:13.460
There's methanol, isopropyl
alcohol, butanol, amyl alcohol.

00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:16.580
But the only one we
drink is ethyl alcohol.

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:19.070
And yes, it's exactly
the same as the ethanol

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:21.932
you put in your car.

00:20:21.932 --> 00:20:23.390
So what is this
stuff that you have

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:28.451
been pouring into your
stomachs and gas tanks?

00:20:28.451 --> 00:20:32.026
[SINGING] Sweet ethanol.

00:20:32.026 --> 00:20:33.435
ALL: [SINGING] Sweet ethanol.

00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:40.210
ANTHONY CAPORALE:
[SINGING] My ethanol.

00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:42.080
ALL: [SINGING] My ethanol.

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:48.166
ANTHONY CAPORALE:
[SINGING] [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:48.166 --> 00:20:52.468
ALL: [SINGING] [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:52.468 --> 00:20:55.127
ANTHONY CAPORALE:
[SINGING] For you I call.

00:20:55.127 --> 00:20:59.353
ALL: [SINGING] For you I call.

00:20:59.353 --> 00:21:01.290
ANTHONY CAPORALE: [SINGING]
In all my dreams--

00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:05.000
ALL: [SINGING] In
all my dreams--

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.605
ANTHONY CAPORALE: [SINGING]
--your fair face beams.

00:21:09.605 --> 00:21:13.300
ALL: [SINGING] --your
fair face beams.

00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:22.174
You're the flower of my
heart, sweet ethanol.

00:21:22.174 --> 00:21:23.170
Sweet ethanol.

00:21:27.154 --> 00:21:28.744
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:28.744 --> 00:21:29.910
ANTHONY CAPORALE: Thank you.

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:37.890
So ethanol is a volatile,
flammable, colorless liquid

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:40.987
with the structural
formula CH3 CH2 OH.

00:21:40.987 --> 00:21:42.570
Now, best known as
the type of alcohol

00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:44.400
found in alcoholic
beverages, it is also

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:48.210
used in thermometers, as
a solvent, and as a fuel.

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:52.800
Ethyl alcohol can cause alcohol
intoxication when consumed.

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:55.470
It is one of the oldest
recreational drugs still used

00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:58.500
by humans with significant
psychoactive effects.

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:00.330
In common usage, it
is often referred

00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:05.110
to simply as alcohol,
liquor, or hooch.

00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:05.610
Yeah.

00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:08.580
No thank you, Wikipedia.

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:12.060
So ethanol is
volatile, That means

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:14.157
it boils at a low temperature.

00:22:14.157 --> 00:22:15.240
You need to remember that.

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:16.230
It's flammable.

00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:19.440
It burns, like in
your car engine.

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:22.650
And of course,
significant psychoactive

00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:26.820
effects which you will be
feeling in just a few minutes.

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:29.130
So let's talk about that.

00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:31.260
I said when our
cavepeople started

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:34.230
drinking the bubbly grain juice
they noticed a few things.

00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:36.214
Well, in addition to
not dying as much,

00:22:36.214 --> 00:22:38.130
another thing they noticed
was that the people

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:41.167
who drank the juice
threw way better parties

00:22:41.167 --> 00:22:42.000
than everybody else.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:42.922
KATE HOOVER: Woo-hoo!

00:22:42.922 --> 00:22:43.812
Yeah!

00:22:43.812 --> 00:22:44.770
ANTHONY CAPORALE: Yeah.

00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:47.170
There was dancing.

00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:49.650
Oh, and singing karaoke.

00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:50.939
NICOLE DIMATTEI: Ahh!

00:22:50.939 --> 00:22:52.480
ANTHONY CAPORALE:
And a lot of times,

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:54.910
you'd wake up next to
somebody you didn't even

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:55.990
know the day before.

00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:57.548
ALEC LEE: Yeah.

00:22:57.548 --> 00:22:59.968
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:59.968 --> 00:23:02.388
NICOLE DIMATTEI: [SINGING]
At first I was afraid,

00:23:02.388 --> 00:23:04.808
I was petrified.

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:10.552
KATE AND ALEC: Yassss.

00:23:10.552 --> 00:23:12.885
NICOLE DIMATTEI: [SINGING] I
kept thinking I could never

00:23:12.885 --> 00:23:16.350
live without you by--

00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:19.495
by-- I'm gonna make you smile.

00:23:19.495 --> 00:23:21.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:21.970
--side.

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:28.544
Don't go away from me.

00:23:28.544 --> 00:23:34.061
But then I spent so many
nights thinking how you--

00:23:34.061 --> 00:23:39.074
you-- me-- yes, you know it.

00:23:39.074 --> 00:23:42.056
Wrong.

00:23:42.056 --> 00:23:45.050
KATE AND ALEC: So wrong.

00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:47.688
NICOLE DIMATTEI:
You have great hair.

00:23:47.688 --> 00:23:48.390
Cool.

00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:50.130
I'll see you later.

00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:52.390
[SINGING] That I
grew-- audience!

00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:53.028
As

00:23:53.028 --> 00:23:53.736
AUDIENCE: Strong!

00:23:53.736 --> 00:23:54.985
ANTHONY CAPORALE: There we go.

00:23:54.985 --> 00:23:56.080
One guy.

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:57.596
NICOLE DIMATTEI: You win.

00:23:57.596 --> 00:23:58.970
I'll give you all
another chance.

00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:00.436
That I grew--

00:24:00.436 --> 00:24:01.408
AUDIENCE: Strong.

00:24:01.408 --> 00:24:02.866
KATE HOOVER: My god.

00:24:02.866 --> 00:24:03.840
Strong.

00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:04.220
NICOLE DIMATTEI: All right.

00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:04.920
One more, guys.

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:06.291
The word is "strong."

00:24:06.291 --> 00:24:07.940
[SINGING] That I grew--

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:08.874
AUDIENCE: Strong!

00:24:08.874 --> 00:24:09.341
NICOLE DIMATTEI: There it is.

00:24:09.341 --> 00:24:11.320
[SINGING] And I learned
how to get along

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:15.140
and so you're back
from outer space.

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:17.020
I just walked in
to find you here

00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:19.370
with that sad look
upon your face.

00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:21.720
I should've changed the
stupid lock, should've

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:22.900
made you leave you key.

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:24.933
If I'd've know for
just one second

00:24:24.933 --> 00:24:27.248
you'd be back to bother me.

00:24:27.248 --> 00:24:29.100
I will survive!

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:32.240
ANTHONY CAPORALE: That's Nicole
DiMattei, ladies and gentlemen.

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:35.960
That's our director right there.

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:39.310
So not only are these grain
drinkers living longer,

00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:41.502
they're living way cooler.

00:24:41.502 --> 00:24:43.210
This really gets our
ancestors attention.

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:45.590
Pretty soon, they become more
interested in the dancing

00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:48.610
and karaoke part of the beer
than the not dying as much

00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:49.199
part.

00:24:49.199 --> 00:24:50.740
They start to wonder
if there's a way

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:52.640
to get just the fun part out--

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:56.846
that dancing and karaoke
spirit of the drink.

00:24:56.846 --> 00:25:01.070
Right around 900 AD, a
Persian physician/philos

00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:06.760
opher/chemist/alchemist by the
name of Muhammad Ibn Zakariya

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:10.585
Al Razi, or Razziz, as he
was known to his peeps--

00:25:10.585 --> 00:25:11.085
ALL: Peeps!

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:15.760
ANTHONY CAPORALE:
--identifies this essence,

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:17.920
which the International
Conference on Chemical

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:20.860
Nomenclature officially names
ethanol about a millennium

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:23.050
later in Geneva, Switzerland.

00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:28.420
But folks, some of us
still just call it spirits.

00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:30.880
So now the problem becomes
how to get those spirits out

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:32.170
of beer.

00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:35.290
Because as cool as beer
and other fermented drinks

00:25:35.290 --> 00:25:38.320
like wine, cider,
and mead are, they're

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:40.171
still mostly water,
and that's just

00:25:40.171 --> 00:25:41.920
going to slow things
down if you're trying

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:43.300
to get a dance party started.

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:43.960
ALEC LEE: Yeah!

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:45.550
Dance party.

00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:47.710
ANTHONY CAPORALE: No, Alec.

00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:48.265
Alec.

00:25:48.265 --> 00:25:49.470
ALEC LEE: Come on, now.

00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:50.317
Here we go.

00:25:50.317 --> 00:25:51.070
Woo!

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:51.570
Woo!

00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:52.528
ANTHONY CAPORALE: Alec.

00:25:52.528 --> 00:25:53.300
ALEC LEE: Woo!

00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:55.340
Yeah.

00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:57.880
ANTHONY CAPORALE: No,
he's very excited.

00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:59.485
We're not twerking yet.

00:25:59.485 --> 00:26:00.850
ALEC LEE: Oh, All right.

00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:01.540
I'll be back.

00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:04.410
ANTHONY CAPORALE: Good.

00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:06.440
All right.

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:10.360
So alcohol is toxic to
microorganisms, right?

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:13.630
But what makes alcohol?

00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:15.254
This was like five minutes ago.

00:26:15.254 --> 00:26:15.920
AUDIENCE: Yeast.

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:16.210
ANTHONY CAPORALE: Yeah.

00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:16.709
Very good.

00:26:16.709 --> 00:26:17.490
Yeast.

00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:19.420
And what is yeast?

00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:22.100
A microorganism.

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:23.610
There's the rub.

00:26:23.610 --> 00:26:26.950
You know, as any of you
that have kept fish,

00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:31.690
or have hamsters,
or children know,

00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:36.740
most things don't thrive
in their own excrement.

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:39.220
Ditto yeast.

00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:41.080
See how our yeast is--

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:43.140
whoa.

00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:44.379
Nicole, nicely done.

00:26:44.379 --> 00:26:45.670
NICOLE DIMATTEI: I made a mess.

00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:47.950
It's perfect.

00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:50.638
Let's give it up for yeast,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:26:50.638 --> 00:26:52.933
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:53.395 --> 00:26:55.895
ANTHONY CAPORALE: You're not
going to hear that at Hamilton.

00:26:59.090 --> 00:26:59.840
All right.

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:02.540
That's not bad for-- that
was like, what, maybe 10

00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:04.340
minutes of fermentation?

00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:05.840
But as soon as the
alcohol builds up

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:11.360
to a certain level, usually
not much more than about 15%,

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:15.140
the yeast will either
go dormant or die.

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:16.520
No more alcohol after that.

00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:21.740
Now this is why most fermented
drinks top out at about 17%

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:23.420
ABV.

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:27.050
Beer's generally
about 3% to 5% ABV.

00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:30.890
Cider hovers around 6%.

00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:32.740
Apples have more
sugar than grain,

00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:35.120
so cider ends up with
more alcohol than beer.

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:37.630
And wine, which usually
starts with the most sugar,

00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:41.150
usually ends up at
between 10% and 15%.

00:27:41.150 --> 00:27:45.583
Any idea what the ABV of
a spirit like vodka is?

00:27:45.583 --> 00:27:46.470
AUDIENCE: 40.

00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:47.830
ANTHONY CAPORALE: 40, very good.

00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:51.400
So my question is, how do we
go from beer, with an alcohol

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:57.280
content of 5%, to vodka, with
an alcohol content of 40,

00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:01.920
if we know the yeast is going
to give up the ghost at 15%?

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:02.420
Say it.

00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:02.900
AUDIENCE: Distillation.

00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:04.610
ANTHONY CAPORALE: Distillation.

00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:06.470
Very good.

00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:08.880
So to find out how we came
up with that neat trick,

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:11.330
you're going to have to come
see The Imbible at New World

00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:12.600
Stages.

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:14.960
We are playing.

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:16.388
Thank you very much.

00:28:16.388 --> 00:28:19.177
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:19.177 --> 00:28:20.510
We'll give you a schedule later.

00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:21.930
Let's give it up
for the cast, guys.

00:28:21.930 --> 00:28:22.846
You guys were awesome.

00:28:22.846 --> 00:28:23.627
Thank you.

00:28:23.627 --> 00:28:26.012
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:28.874 --> 00:28:33.770
SPEAKER: So this show, I saw
it recently in its entirety.

00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:35.120
Fantastic show.

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:36.669
ANTHONY CAPORALE: Thank you.

00:28:36.669 --> 00:28:38.960
SPEAKER: And I've had to try
to-- as I'm telling people

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:42.260
to go see it, the way
I have described it is,

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:44.720
the show itself is a cocktail--

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:49.460
two parts world history,
one part anthropology,

00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:53.000
a dash of chemistry,
with a liberal garnish

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.690
of barbershop quartet,
which sounds delicious.

00:28:57.690 --> 00:28:58.940
ANTHONY CAPORALE: I love that.

00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:00.200
ALEC LEE: Very accurate.

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:03.020
SPEAKER: How did you come
up with the idea for this?

00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:04.010
Where did it start?

00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:06.660
ANTHONY CAPORALE: So
like all good cocktails,

00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:11.820
the origin story is a little
muddy and very collaborative.

00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:14.780
I guess the genesis
of the show started

00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:17.450
with lectures and
seminars that I was giving

00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:20.300
within the beverage industry.

00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:22.370
I teach at the Institute
of Culinary Education.

00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:24.161
I'm the director of
beverage studies there.

00:29:24.161 --> 00:29:27.410
And also, I used to do a lot
of work with the liquor brands.

00:29:27.410 --> 00:29:30.030
I was a national
brand ambassador.

00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:31.430
And a lot of educational work.

00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:33.980
So I would give sort of
very high level talks

00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:36.590
on spirits and cocktails,
history, science,

00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:39.836
trying to engage consumers
and also bartenders.

00:29:39.836 --> 00:29:41.960
And my degree's actually
in mechanical engineering,

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:44.249
so I would get pretty geeky
in these presentations.

00:29:44.249 --> 00:29:46.790
But I would always-- but we've
been running theater companies

00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:47.520
as well.

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:49.739
So I was running a
company with Nicole,

00:29:49.739 --> 00:29:51.530
which is the company
that we're currently--

00:29:51.530 --> 00:29:54.140
Broadway Theater Studio,
which produces The Imbible.

00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:56.690
And we decided that
we would incorporate

00:29:56.690 --> 00:29:57.980
some elements of theater--

00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:00.560
sketches and comedy
and stuff like that--

00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:01.730
into the presentations.

00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:05.120
And people loved them because,
in these presentations,

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:07.160
you also always get cocktails.

00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:08.660
You're not going
to go to a seminar

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:11.510
hosted by Bacardi unless
you're getting a Bacardi drink.

00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:14.280
So the standard was always three
drinks within like a couple

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:15.520
hours that you get.

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:20.604
And after one of these, called
The Science of Mixology,

00:30:20.604 --> 00:30:23.270
someone came up to me afterwards
and said, you live in New York.

00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:26.120
If you did this exact
presentation downtown

00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:28.610
on a Friday night,
I would go see it.

00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:32.090
So fast forward five
years or something

00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:36.470
like that, Nicole, who's an
incredibly talented writer,

00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:39.830
had been writing some plays and
was entering a show in the New

00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:42.110
York Fringe Festival 2014.

00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:43.874
And I said, you know,
I have this idea.

00:30:43.874 --> 00:30:45.540
Would you mind if I
also entered a show?

00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:46.700
And she was like,
yeah, we could--

00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:47.950
one of them--
neither of them are

00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:49.250
going to get in, but whatever.

00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:50.145
Double our chances.

00:30:50.145 --> 00:30:51.770
Well, they both got
in, and we ended up

00:30:51.770 --> 00:30:54.500
producing two full length
shows in the Fringe Festival

00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:56.210
at one time.

00:30:56.210 --> 00:30:59.030
And the Imbible
got a lot of press

00:30:59.030 --> 00:31:01.760
because we served
drinks during the show.

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:03.990
That had never been
done at Fringe.

00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:06.410
So we got encored, and then
we opened Off-Broadway shortly

00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:08.300
after that.

00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:10.400
It started, like I
said, as lectures.

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:13.490
The idea to bring in
sort of Greek chorus

00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:18.200
and introduce music and comedy
and sketches and costumes

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:22.590
and all of this, the majority
of that is due to Nicole.

00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:24.470
She came aboard as
the director and said,

00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:25.770
you know, I have this vision.

00:31:25.770 --> 00:31:28.440
What if you are the bartender
and there's a staff behind you

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:31.220
that sort of all are analogous
to restaurant servers,

00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:32.780
and they can help
propel the story.

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:34.820
And what was going
to originally just be

00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:39.670
a one man show turned into
this full musical comedy.

00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:43.040
SPEAKER: Fantastic.

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:47.540
The acapella harmonies that
you all are doing are amazing.

00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:49.280
Like, it's not
anything else that--

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:50.696
certainly not
anything else that's

00:31:50.696 --> 00:31:54.170
happening on Broadway
right now or near it.

00:31:54.170 --> 00:31:55.490
Did that come easily?

00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:57.950
I mean, is this your training?

00:31:57.950 --> 00:32:01.070
ALEC LEE: Well, I studied
theater and music in college.

00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:03.890
But one of my favorite
experiences in college,

00:32:03.890 --> 00:32:05.810
I was in an acapella
group, and people

00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:08.440
would say that we were a
drinking group with a singing

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:08.940
problem.

00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:12.320
So I spent a lot of time
during my college training

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:14.570
actually in an acapella group.

00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:17.960
And often, alcohol was involved,
so this was a perfect fit

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:20.489
for me right out of college.

00:32:20.489 --> 00:32:21.780
KATE HOOVER: I just love booze.

00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:25.130
No, I also went to school
for musical theater.

00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:27.839
I never really had acappella
training, but I just--

00:32:27.839 --> 00:32:28.380
I don't know.

00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:31.010
I've always been very good at
just listening and hearing,

00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:33.460
picking up other
parts and whatnot.

00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:35.360
And I mean, I'm
fortunate-- again,

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:39.110
I have talented coworkers that
just mesh with me very well.

00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:40.110
SPEAKER: It's fantastic.

00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:42.940
NICOLE DIMATTEI:
It's a unique talent

00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:44.579
and actually hard to find.

00:32:44.579 --> 00:32:46.620
We've been casting this
show now for three years,

00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:48.440
and we have four
versions of the show.

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:53.900
So we have a rum show, a brunch
show, and a Christmas show.

00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:56.810
And to find casts that
are able to do this,

00:32:56.810 --> 00:33:00.890
because most musical theater
kids right out of college

00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:04.610
are trained to just
stand and sing their solo

00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:07.010
with an orchestra behind them.

00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:08.330
That's not this at all.

00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:10.760
You have to be able to hold
your own part while people

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:14.070
right next to you are singing
something completely different.

00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:16.706
And there's no
orchestra to help you.

00:33:16.706 --> 00:33:17.330
SPEAKER: Right.

00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:20.090
Which has got to save
money but be frustrating?

00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:21.048
ANTHONY CAPORALE: That.

00:33:21.048 --> 00:33:21.984
Both of those things.

00:33:21.984 --> 00:33:22.525
SPEAKER: Yes.

00:33:22.525 --> 00:33:24.000
Exactly.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.420
You talk about these
skills to have.

00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:33.380
In addition to being an acapella
group who is also doing comedy,

00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:37.502
you're going around serving
drinks with trays in hand.

00:33:37.502 --> 00:33:38.210
KATE HOOVER: Yes.

00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:39.835
NICOLE DIMATTEI: So
that opening number

00:33:39.835 --> 00:33:41.770
we sang, we actually
serve the audience

00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:43.690
the first drink during it.

00:33:43.690 --> 00:33:44.270
We get that.

00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:46.665
And then, hilariously, people
see us as servers then.

00:33:46.665 --> 00:33:48.040
And we're singing
in their faces,

00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:49.414
and they're trying
to talk to us.

00:33:49.414 --> 00:33:52.387
Like, can I actually get
water, or what's in this?

00:33:52.387 --> 00:33:54.220
And I'm like, I am
singing a song right now.

00:33:57.100 --> 00:33:58.420
SPEAKER: Do they ever tip?

00:33:58.420 --> 00:33:59.570
ANTHONY CAPORALE: Yes.

00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:00.070
SPEAKER: Oh.

00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:01.839
ANTHONY CAPORALE: Yes, they do.

00:34:01.839 --> 00:34:02.380
SPEAKER: Wow.

00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:05.502
You've really-- this
business model is fantastic.

00:34:05.502 --> 00:34:06.960
ANTHONY CAPORALE:
It's a good deal.

00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:08.376
But to Nicole's
point, we actually

00:34:08.376 --> 00:34:09.969
put, in all of
our casting calls,

00:34:09.969 --> 00:34:13.540
that we're looking for actors
with serving experience,

00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:15.580
because not only
are we asking people

00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:18.697
to remember bits and do
costume changes and sing,

00:34:18.697 --> 00:34:20.530
but they got to do it
while they're carrying

00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:21.571
trays and serving drinks.

00:34:21.571 --> 00:34:23.739
And that's something it's
difficult to just pick up

00:34:23.739 --> 00:34:24.820
off the street.

00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:28.949
So luckily, many actors also
have restaurant experience.

00:34:28.949 --> 00:34:30.850
NICOLE DIMATTEI: But
actually, Kate didn't.

00:34:30.850 --> 00:34:32.679
She was just so talented,
and we loved her.

00:34:32.679 --> 00:34:35.310
And she has great people
skills and wonderful at improv,

00:34:35.310 --> 00:34:36.310
which is really helpful.

00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:38.280
Our show is right in your face.

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:40.179
But Kate has a great
story about the night

00:34:40.179 --> 00:34:41.170
before her first show.

00:34:41.170 --> 00:34:42.461
KATE HOOVER: I am not a server.

00:34:42.461 --> 00:34:45.800
I've had like one serving
job, and I was rubbish at it.

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:46.670
I was not good.

00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:48.639
And so, of course, I
got hired for this,

00:34:48.639 --> 00:34:51.489
and I was so nervous the
night before my first show

00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:54.310
that I remember
I was up at 2 AM.

00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:57.940
I found something to make a tray
with, and I was serving drinks

00:34:57.940 --> 00:35:00.880
and like going over my
part to my cats in my room.

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:02.560
Just like, [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:05.320
Trying to make sure,
please don't spill

00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:06.340
this during the show.

00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:09.860
But literally, that was
the most nervous I was.

00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:13.360
And even to this day, I'm
a little better at it now,

00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:15.460
but I still have that
moment of like, oh shit,

00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:16.810
before I go on-- oh, sorry.

00:35:16.810 --> 00:35:17.310
Sorry.

00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:17.750
I didn't mean to swear.

00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:18.750
SPEAKER: It's all right.

00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:19.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:20.749 --> 00:35:21.540
KATE HOOVER: Great.

00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:22.520
Everyone is going to see that.

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:22.730
Yeah.

00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:24.021
NICOLE DIMATTEI: Just drink it.

00:35:24.021 --> 00:35:27.200
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:29.035
KATE HOOVER: But it's
better now, obviously.

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:36.000
SPEAKER: And it's not just
that, oh, you know, crack open

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.900
a Coors Light and hand it out.

00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:40.600
You're making real cocktails.

00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:42.100
When I was there you make--

00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:46.250
spoiler alert-- an Old
Fashioned that was amazing.

00:35:46.250 --> 00:35:53.227
This was like caramel sugar with
apples, and it was incredible.

00:35:53.227 --> 00:35:55.060
It was one of the best
drinks I've ever had.

00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:58.132
And I understand that was
just the drink that night

00:35:58.132 --> 00:35:58.840
when I was there.

00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:02.470
How often does it
change, and who decides?

00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:05.052
ANTHONY CAPORALE: So,
again, collaborative.

00:36:05.052 --> 00:36:06.760
The Old Fashioned we
used because there's

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:08.530
a very interesting story
behind the Old Fashioned

00:36:08.530 --> 00:36:10.700
that we actually-- the drinks
that we serve aren't random.

00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:11.920
They're all incorporated
into the script.

00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:14.230
So as we're teaching you
about the history of a drink,

00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:16.120
we will serve it to you.

00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:20.830
And the Old Fashioned is more of
a template than a recipe, so we

00:36:20.830 --> 00:36:22.970
change it up every month or two.

00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:25.000
And actually, we
have a stage manager,

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.340
who's been with us for
about three years now,

00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:29.170
and we kind of
given her free rein

00:36:29.170 --> 00:36:31.630
to come up with the flavors
for the Old Fashioned.

00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:33.310
So if you like
the caramel apple,

00:36:33.310 --> 00:36:35.730
I will tell Kim that you
like the caramel apple.

00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:36.940
Before that we had--

00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:37.660
what did we have?

00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:37.990
KATE HOOVER: Strawberry.

00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:39.100
NICOLE DIMATTEI:
Strawberry and basil.

00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:40.300
ANTHONY CAPORALE: Creamsicle.

00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:40.760
Yeah.

00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:42.510
We've done some really,
really cool stuff.

00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:45.175
SPEAKER: So there is incentive
to see the show multiple times.

00:36:45.175 --> 00:36:46.508
ANTHONY CAPORALE: There is, yes.

00:36:46.508 --> 00:36:47.060
There is.

00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:48.020
Absolutely.

00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:49.690
I mean, if we're
going to talk about--

00:36:49.690 --> 00:36:54.700
I've been in the bartending
world since 1911 or something

00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:55.999
now.

00:36:55.999 --> 00:36:57.790
We kind of feel an
obligation that if we're

00:36:57.790 --> 00:37:00.430
going to put ourselves out
there in a position where we're

00:37:00.430 --> 00:37:02.720
going to teach you about
spirits and cocktails,

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:04.510
we should put our money
where our mouth is

00:37:04.510 --> 00:37:07.120
and give you some pretty
darn good cocktails.

00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:08.060
So we try and do that.

00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:08.560
Thank you.

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:09.790
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

00:37:09.790 --> 00:37:12.610
SPEAKER: It's also got to make
for some interesting audiences.

00:37:12.610 --> 00:37:14.930
ALEC LEE: Oh, yes.

00:37:14.930 --> 00:37:18.100
SPEAKER: What is the best
and/or worst story you've got?

00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:20.350
ALEC LEE: Oh, who
wants to tell it?

00:37:20.350 --> 00:37:22.100
KATE HOOVER: You've
got a really good one.

00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:23.170
ALEC LEE: No, Nicole's got it.

00:37:23.170 --> 00:37:23.620
KATE HOOVER: Yeah.

00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:24.401
Nicole's got it probably.

00:37:24.401 --> 00:37:24.901
Thank you.

00:37:24.901 --> 00:37:25.900
ALEC LEE: Thank you.

00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:26.410
Cheers.

00:37:26.410 --> 00:37:27.150
KATE HOOVER: Woo.

00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:28.030
VMP!

00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:28.790
MVP?

00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:29.706
NICOLE DIMATTEI: What?

00:37:29.706 --> 00:37:31.390
KATE HOOVER: I don't know.

00:37:31.390 --> 00:37:36.670
NICOLE DIMATTEI: So we had--

00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:38.800
our audiences range in age.

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:40.990
You know, we have
the 21-year-olds who

00:37:40.990 --> 00:37:43.930
want to come drink, and then
we have the older people

00:37:43.930 --> 00:37:45.760
that really enjoy the history.

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:48.169
And they're honestly
my favorite.

00:37:48.169 --> 00:37:49.960
But then sometimes we
get these like middle

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:52.426
aged women, and then--

00:37:52.426 --> 00:37:55.870
ANTHONY CAPORALE: This is
why she's telling the story.

00:37:55.870 --> 00:37:59.020
NICOLE DIMATTEI: You
know, like late 50s

00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:02.660
and just out for a good time
and very interesting people.

00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:06.400
And we had five
of them on stage--

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:08.944
SPEAKER: We should
probably-- oh, thank you.

00:38:08.944 --> 00:38:09.860
NICOLE DIMATTEI: Yeah.

00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:13.000
SPEAKER: The stage-- this
isn't a standard theater set.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.350
Your set is a bar.

00:38:15.350 --> 00:38:17.480
We're all sitting
at the bar with you.

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:17.980
OK.

00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:21.280
NICOLE DIMATTEI: So this is--

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:23.230
we were at a different
space for two years.

00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:25.271
And now, this past year,
we've been at New World,

00:38:25.271 --> 00:38:26.650
where you saw the show.

00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:29.080
And our premium
seats are at the bar.

00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:31.660
Like, literally, you are
on bar stools at the bar.

00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:34.312
We had a small stage
at the other show

00:38:34.312 --> 00:38:36.520
that was like across from
the bar and our premium set

00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:37.690
on the stage.

00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:40.330
So this group of five women
were sitting on the stage,

00:38:40.330 --> 00:38:43.720
and Anthony starts
talking about the yeast.

00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:47.070
And the one woman goes,
Kathy has a yeast infection

00:38:47.070 --> 00:38:50.050
right now.

00:38:50.050 --> 00:38:54.590
ANTHONY CAPORALE: It stopped
the show if you can imagine.

00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:55.640
SPEAKER: To Kathy.

00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:57.337
ALL: To Kathy!

00:38:57.337 --> 00:38:58.420
KATE HOOVER: Never forget.

00:38:58.420 --> 00:38:59.650
I'll never forget Kathy.

00:39:02.370 --> 00:39:06.560
SPEAKER: Now, this is not your
first interaction with Google.

00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:07.990
ANTHONY CAPORALE: No.

00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:12.130
SPEAKER: I learned this
kind of incidentally.

00:39:12.130 --> 00:39:14.110
We have some things
that we've been

00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:17.440
doing with the slow food
program and with farm

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:19.030
to table projects.

00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:21.132
And apparently, you're
involved there too.

00:39:21.132 --> 00:39:22.090
ANTHONY CAPORALE: Yeah.

00:39:22.090 --> 00:39:25.004
So we're going to be
doing, I think, with--

00:39:25.004 --> 00:39:26.920
SPEAKER: Vanessa the
Googler who is off stage.

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:27.070
ANTHONY CAPORALE: Yeah.

00:39:27.070 --> 00:39:28.819
We're gonna be doing
a cocktail event that

00:39:28.819 --> 00:39:32.140
is going to be sustainable
cocktails and farm

00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:34.570
to table and like all
kinds of really good stuff.

00:39:34.570 --> 00:39:37.000
And then I also did
a talk at Google

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.059
a few years back on
the history of whisky.

00:39:40.059 --> 00:39:42.100
I think it's called the
Wonderful World of Whisky

00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:45.490
or something like
that, where we actually

00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:47.410
talked for about an
hour and a half just

00:39:47.410 --> 00:39:49.301
on whisky and the
science and history

00:39:49.301 --> 00:39:50.800
and cultural
significance of whisky.

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:52.017
It was amazing.

00:39:52.017 --> 00:39:52.600
You guys are--

00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:53.440
AUDIENCE: You distilled.

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:53.990
ANTHONY CAPORALE: Awesome.

00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:54.665
Yes.

00:39:54.665 --> 00:39:56.060
AUDIENCE: I remember
that in a [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:56.525
ANTHONY CAPORALE: Yeah.

00:39:56.525 --> 00:39:57.455
You remember it?

00:39:57.455 --> 00:39:58.109
I love it.

00:39:58.109 --> 00:40:00.400
KATE HOOVER: Are you drinking
out of a stein right now?

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:01.700
Is that like a metal--

00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:03.392
NICOLE DIMATTEI: Oh my gosh.

00:40:03.392 --> 00:40:05.060
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:06.820
ALEC LEE: I suppose
that's right.

00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:07.570
ANTHONY CAPORALE:
That's amazing.

00:40:07.570 --> 00:40:07.930
NICOLE DIMATTEI: I love it.

00:40:07.930 --> 00:40:08.380
ANTHONY CAPORALE: Yeah.

00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:11.320
We actually set up the distiller
and distilled moonshine right

00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:11.950
on stage.

00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:15.320
So yeah, you guys are awesome.

00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:16.419
It's a great, great place.

00:40:16.419 --> 00:40:16.960
SPEAKER: Wow.

00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:17.770
Thank you.

00:40:17.770 --> 00:40:19.540
That's the other thing.

00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:22.630
So you're serving drinks
and you're harmonizing

00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:25.480
and you're dancing and
you're hitting all your marks

00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:28.060
and you're giving this
incredibly engaging lecture

00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:33.910
and you're setting up science
experiments on the fly.

00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:37.080
Has that always gone
perfectly every show?

00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:37.830
ALEC LEE: Usually.

00:40:37.830 --> 00:40:38.830
ANTHONY CAPORALE:
I'm not doing that.

00:40:38.830 --> 00:40:40.030
They are doing that.

00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:41.140
ALEC LEE: 90% of the time.

00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:42.880
KATE HOOVER: We do
a pretty good job.

00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:45.520
I mean, the most that'll go
wrong is, every now and then,

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:47.722
we'll have a cylinder
that starts to-- meeh--

00:40:47.722 --> 00:40:49.180
kind of like leaning
tower of Pisa.

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:51.638
And then we just have to go
and straighten it and adjust it

00:40:51.638 --> 00:40:52.497
during intermission.

00:40:52.497 --> 00:40:53.830
But we've never really had any--

00:40:53.830 --> 00:40:54.150
NICOLE DIMATTEI: Yeah.

00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:54.400
I mean--

00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:55.370
KATE HOOVER: Knock on wood.

00:40:55.370 --> 00:40:56.290
ALEC LEE: We've also--

00:40:56.290 --> 00:40:57.880
yeah, we've learned
enough about how

00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:01.210
to make it work that if
it happens to malfunction

00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:06.190
in some way, we've always been
able to fix it within the show

00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:08.180
and make it work.

00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:08.680
So yeah.

00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:10.930
I mean, it's just gotten to
the point where we're just

00:41:10.930 --> 00:41:12.550
used to how it's done.

00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:14.940
SPEAKER: The science here
works pretty much the same way.

00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:17.090
80% of the time, it
works every time.

00:41:17.090 --> 00:41:19.715
KATE HOOVER: Now you've got that
[INAUDIBLE] out, I don't know.

00:41:19.715 --> 00:41:20.216
I'm just--

00:41:20.216 --> 00:41:21.798
ANTHONY CAPORALE:
But to their credit,

00:41:21.798 --> 00:41:23.350
I mean, you make a great point.

00:41:23.350 --> 00:41:27.410
We actually distill moonshine
live on stage, for real,

00:41:27.410 --> 00:41:28.780
from beer, in real time.

00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:31.930
And then we prove that it's
ethanol, the whole bit.

00:41:31.930 --> 00:41:33.430
And the show's been--

00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:35.770
we're probably coming up
on 600 performances now,

00:41:35.770 --> 00:41:36.920
I got to believe?

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:41.380
That's 600 distillation
runs that this cast has,

00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:45.080
which is probably more
than some microdistilleries

00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:45.790
at this point.

00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:47.040
I'm not even kidding.

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:49.761
It's a lot of booze
that they make,

00:41:49.761 --> 00:41:51.760
and it's got to go perfectly
every single night.

00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:55.000
And that doesn't happen in
commercial distilleries.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.710
I mean, I don't think
I express to you

00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:58.959
guys enough how impressed
I am with the way

00:41:58.959 --> 00:42:01.000
that you do that, because
there is no safety net,

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.620
there are no tricks.

00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:04.180
They actually take
beer and turn it

00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:07.010
into moonshine every single
night in front of the audience.

00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:08.680
And it's just fantastic.

00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:10.790
And I just sit there and sings.

00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:11.950
SPEAKER: Huzzah!

00:42:11.950 --> 00:42:13.747
Drink to that.

00:42:13.747 --> 00:42:14.830
KATE HOOVER: [INAUDIBLE] .

00:42:14.830 --> 00:42:16.690
SPEAKER: Before we wrap,
do we have questions

00:42:16.690 --> 00:42:17.439
from the audience?

00:42:17.439 --> 00:42:20.428
Anything about the show?

00:42:20.428 --> 00:42:22.205
AUDIENCE: When's your next show?

00:42:22.205 --> 00:42:23.080
KATE HOOVER: Tonight.

00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:23.830
ALEC LEE: Tonight.

00:42:23.830 --> 00:42:24.982
8 o'clock.

00:42:24.982 --> 00:42:26.690
ANTHONY CAPORALE: So
what's the schedule?

00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:28.730
NICOLE DIMATTEI: So we run
Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays

00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:29.270
at 8 PM.

00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:30.890
Saturdays at 5 and 8 PM.

00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:34.070
That's this show, The Imbible
Spirited History of Drinking.

00:42:34.070 --> 00:42:35.900
The Imbible day drinking--

00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:37.790
it's the history of
brunch and brunch

00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:41.040
cocktails with a build
your own Bloody Mary bar.

00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:43.070
It also tells the
story of coffee,

00:42:43.070 --> 00:42:45.320
and we make Irish coffees,
and the story of champagne,

00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:47.330
and we make bellinis.

00:42:47.330 --> 00:42:49.240
That runs Tuesdays-- Tuesdays.

00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:51.440
That doesn't make any sense.

00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:54.170
Saturdays at 2:00
and Sundays at 3:00.

00:42:54.170 --> 00:42:57.444
And then, mid-November,
we'll start Christmas.

00:42:57.444 --> 00:42:59.360
ANTHONY CAPORALE: So we
have a Christmas show,

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:01.151
which is called The
Imbible Christmas Carol

00:43:01.151 --> 00:43:05.550
Cocktails, that is basically a
retelling of A Christmas Carol.

00:43:05.550 --> 00:43:08.217
SPEAKER: The hangovers
of Christmas past.

00:43:08.217 --> 00:43:09.800
ANTHONY CAPORALE:
It actually picks up

00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:11.549
at the end of the book,
and Scrooge is all

00:43:11.549 --> 00:43:12.500
happy about Christmas.

00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:14.000
He decides he wants to
throw a big Christmas party,

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.625
but he realizes he doesn't know
how to make drinks because he's

00:43:16.625 --> 00:43:17.850
been Scrooge his whole life.

00:43:17.850 --> 00:43:19.649
So he calls all the
holiday spirits back--

00:43:19.649 --> 00:43:20.690
NICOLE DIMATTEI: Spirits.

00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:21.290
KATE HOOVER: Spirits.

00:43:21.290 --> 00:43:22.980
ANTHONY CAPORALE: See
what we did there.

00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:25.021
They go out for another
night, but this time they

00:43:25.021 --> 00:43:28.140
teach him about cocktails
past, present, and future.

00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:30.237
And so we teach you like
the history of eggnog

00:43:30.237 --> 00:43:31.820
and why we drink
that, and we actually

00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:34.810
serve a precursor to eggnog
and go through all that.

00:43:34.810 --> 00:43:37.070
In the last drink,
we actually use

00:43:37.070 --> 00:43:42.350
liquid nitrogen live on stage
and titrate alcoholic cream

00:43:42.350 --> 00:43:44.840
into Dippin' Dots live on stage.

00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:47.810
We make alcoholic Dippin'
Dots live for 70 people.

00:43:47.810 --> 00:43:49.704
So these guys are crazy, man.

00:43:49.704 --> 00:43:51.120
They do some really
amazing stuff.

00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:53.082
SPEAKER: The Rockettes
got nothing on you.

00:43:53.082 --> 00:43:54.480
NICOLE DIMATTEI: And
we can kick our faces.

00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:54.590
ALEC LEE: Yeah.

00:43:54.590 --> 00:43:55.770
We also do kick lines.

00:43:55.770 --> 00:43:57.205
We also do kick lines.

00:43:57.205 --> 00:43:59.330
ANTHONY CAPORALE: So you
