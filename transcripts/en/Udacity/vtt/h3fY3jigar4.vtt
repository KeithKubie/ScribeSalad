00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Hi everybody. Welcome back.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We're now starting Unit 2, which is going to focus on graphs and their growth.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Last time what we talked about was an introduction to the idea of an algorithm

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and how different algorithms can let you do different things fast or slow

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and starting talking a little bit about analyzing the running time of algorithms.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Now, for reasons that are not entirely clear to me,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
even though this is a course about analyzing social networks,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
a vast majority of our discussion last times was on multiplying numbers together.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
There is a reason for that. It was a simple problem that is easy for everybody

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
to understand and appreciate where the algorithm choice can make a very, very big difference

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
in the behavior of the algorithm once it's implemented.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
This time, we're going to focus on tools for analyzing growth rates

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
so that we have a way of counting up how long running time is going to be

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
that we can analyse more easily than actually counting in detail what every statement

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
is going to be.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
At the same time, we're going to develop a feel for the kinds of graph networks

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
that are really important in analyzing social networks.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
But, before we begin, we're going to try another little magic trick.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Here's a block of number that I mostly randomly generated--

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
a bunch of three-digit numbers--and I want you to figure out as quickly as you can

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
whether the product of all these numbers is divisible by 5

00:01:17.000 --> 09:59:59.000
or if it's not divisible by 5.
