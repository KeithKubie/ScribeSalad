00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.141
- [Voiceover] So, our setup is
that we have some kind of two

00:00:03.141 --> 00:00:05.014
variable function f of x, y,

00:00:05.014 --> 00:00:06.628
who has a scaler output,

00:00:06.628 --> 00:00:08.316
and the goal is to approximate it

00:00:08.316 --> 00:00:10.372
near a specific input point,

00:00:10.372 --> 00:00:11.950
and this is something
I've already talked about

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.446
in context of a local linearization,

00:00:14.446 --> 00:00:16.275
and I've written out the full local,

00:00:16.275 --> 00:00:19.978
the full local linearization,
hard words to say,

00:00:19.978 --> 00:00:22.116
local linearization in its most

00:00:22.116 --> 00:00:24.012
abstract and general form,

00:00:24.012 --> 00:00:25.496
and it looks like quite the beast,

00:00:25.496 --> 00:00:27.018
but once you actually break it apart,

00:00:27.018 --> 00:00:27.854
which I'll do in a moment, it's, it's

00:00:27.854 --> 00:00:29.458
not actually that bad.

00:00:29.458 --> 00:00:30.862
And the goal of this video is gonna be

00:00:30.862 --> 00:00:33.219
to extend this idea and it'll literally be

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:35.634
just adding terms onto this formula

00:00:35.634 --> 00:00:37.739
to get a quadratic approximation.

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:38.701
And what that means is,

00:00:38.701 --> 00:00:40.533
we're starting to allow
ourselves to use terms

00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:44.563
like x squared, x times y, and y squared.

00:00:44.563 --> 00:00:46.123
And quadratic basically just means

00:00:46.123 --> 00:00:48.979
any time you have two
variables multiplied together.

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:51.260
So here you have two
Xs multiplied together,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.538
here it's an x multiplied with a y,

00:00:53.538 --> 00:00:56.121
and here y squared, that kind of thing.

00:00:56.121 --> 00:00:58.401
So let's take a look at
this local linearization.

00:00:58.401 --> 00:00:59.347
It seems like a lot,

00:00:59.347 --> 00:01:00.674
but once you actually
kind of go through term

00:01:00.674 --> 00:01:02.614
by term, um, you realize

00:01:02.614 --> 00:01:04.337
it's a relatively simple function,

00:01:04.337 --> 00:01:06.024
and if you were to plug in numbers

00:01:06.024 --> 00:01:07.204
for the constant terms,

00:01:07.204 --> 00:01:09.500
it would come out as
something relatively simple.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.627
Cause this right here

00:01:10.627 --> 00:01:12.106
where you're evaluating the function

00:01:12.106 --> 00:01:13.537
at this specific input point,

00:01:13.537 --> 00:01:15.251
that's just gonna be
some kind of constant.

00:01:15.251 --> 00:01:17.656
That's just gonna output
some kind of number.

00:01:17.656 --> 00:01:19.821
And similarly, when you do that to the,

00:01:19.821 --> 00:01:22.283
the partial derivative, this little f of x

00:01:22.283 --> 00:01:24.120
means partial derivative at that point,

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.783
you're just getting another number.

00:01:25.783 --> 00:01:28.077
And over here, this is
also just another number,

00:01:28.077 --> 00:01:29.802
but we've written it in
the abstract form so that

00:01:29.802 --> 00:01:32.494
ah, you can see what you
would need to plug-in

00:01:32.494 --> 00:01:35.129
for any function and for
any possible input point.

00:01:35.129 --> 00:01:36.935
And the reason for having it like this,

00:01:36.935 --> 00:01:38.891
the reason that it comes out to this form

00:01:38.891 --> 00:01:40.893
is because of a few important properties

00:01:40.893 --> 00:01:42.586
that this linearization has.

00:01:42.586 --> 00:01:44.847
Let me move this stuff out of the way.

00:01:44.847 --> 00:01:46.452
We'll get back to it in a moment, um, but

00:01:46.452 --> 00:01:47.823
I just wanna emphasize

00:01:47.823 --> 00:01:49.174
a few properties that this has

00:01:49.174 --> 00:01:50.710
because it's gonna be
properties that we want

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.154
our quadratic approximation
to have as well.

00:01:53.154 --> 00:01:56.396
First of all, when you
actually evaluate this function

00:01:56.396 --> 00:01:59.979
at the desired point, at x knot, y knot,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.868
what do you get?

00:02:02.868 --> 00:02:05.124
Well, this constant term isn't influenced

00:02:05.124 --> 00:02:08.261
by the variable, so you'll just get that f

00:02:08.261 --> 00:02:10.314
evaluated at those points

00:02:10.314 --> 00:02:11.564
x knot, y knot.

00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:14.260
And now the rest of the terms.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.093
When we plug-in x here,

00:02:15.093 --> 00:02:16.837
this is the only place where
you actually see the variable.

00:02:16.837 --> 00:02:18.380
Maybe that's worth pointing out, right?

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.646
We've got two variables here

00:02:19.646 --> 00:02:20.816
and there's a lot going on,

00:02:20.816 --> 00:02:23.082
but the only places where you
actually see those variables

00:02:23.082 --> 00:02:25.442
show up where you have
to plug-in anything, um,

00:02:25.442 --> 00:02:27.222
is over here and over here.

00:02:27.222 --> 00:02:30.098
When you plug-in x knot
for our, our initial input,

00:02:30.098 --> 00:02:33.527
this entire term goes to zero, right?

00:02:33.527 --> 00:02:36.300
And then similarly when you
plug in y knot over here,

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.935
this entire term is gonna go to zero,

00:02:38.935 --> 00:02:41.260
which multiplies out
to zero for everything.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.271
So what you end up with,

00:02:42.271 --> 00:02:43.656
you don't have to add anything else.

00:02:43.656 --> 00:02:45.357
This is just a fact,

00:02:45.357 --> 00:02:46.294
and this is an important fact

00:02:46.294 --> 00:02:47.332
cause it tells you your,

00:02:47.332 --> 00:02:49.339
your approximation for the function

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:51.557
at the point about which
you are approximating,

00:02:51.557 --> 00:02:53.669
actually equals the value of
the function at that point.

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:54.709
So that's very good.

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.451
But we have a couple
other important facts also

00:02:56.451 --> 00:02:58.556
because this isn't just
a constant approximation,

00:02:58.556 --> 00:03:00.426
this is doing a little bit more for us.

00:03:00.426 --> 00:03:02.457
If you were to take the partial derivative

00:03:02.457 --> 00:03:06.305
of this linearization
with respect to x, um,

00:03:06.305 --> 00:03:07.948
what do you get?

00:03:07.948 --> 00:03:08.781
What do you get when you actually

00:03:08.781 --> 00:03:10.957
take this partial derivative?

00:03:10.957 --> 00:03:13.030
Well, if you look up at
the original function

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.369
this constant term is nothing,

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:16.524
so that just corresponds to a zero.

00:03:16.524 --> 00:03:18.772
Over here, this entire thing

00:03:18.772 --> 00:03:22.440
looks like a constant
multiplied by x minus something,

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.736
and if you differentiate this

00:03:23.736 --> 00:03:25.190
with respect to x,

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.368
what you're gonna get
is that constant term,

00:03:27.368 --> 00:03:29.215
which is the partial derivative of f

00:03:29.215 --> 00:03:32.298
evaluated at our, our specific point.

00:03:34.632 --> 00:03:36.699
And then the other term has no Xs in it,

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:39.327
it's just a y, which as far
as x concerned is a constant.

00:03:39.327 --> 00:03:41.430
So this whole thing would be zero.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.791
Which means the partial derivative

00:03:42.791 --> 00:03:45.959
with respect to x is equal to the value

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.070
of the partial derivative
of our original function

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:49.947
with respect to x at that point.

00:03:49.947 --> 00:03:51.535
Now notice, this is not saying

00:03:51.535 --> 00:03:54.375
that our linearization has
the same partial derivative

00:03:54.375 --> 00:03:56.734
as f everywhere, it's just saying that

00:03:56.734 --> 00:03:59.304
its partial derivative
happens to be a constant

00:03:59.304 --> 00:04:00.731
and the constant that it is,

00:04:00.731 --> 00:04:02.860
is the value of the
partial derivative of f

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.905
at that specific input point.

00:04:04.905 --> 00:04:06.509
And you can do pretty much the same thing,

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:08.505
and you'll, you'll see that
the partial derivative of the

00:04:08.505 --> 00:04:11.852
linearization with respect
to y is a constant,

00:04:11.852 --> 00:04:13.683
and the constant that it happens to be

00:04:13.683 --> 00:04:15.959
is the value of the
partial derivative of f

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.534
evaluated at that desired point.

00:04:18.534 --> 00:04:19.718
So these are three facts.

00:04:19.718 --> 00:04:21.190
You know the, the value of the

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.579
linearization at the point,

00:04:22.579 --> 00:04:25.175
and the value of its two
different partial derivatives.

00:04:25.175 --> 00:04:27.918
And these kind of define
the linearization itself.

00:04:27.918 --> 00:04:30.264
Now what we're gonna do for
the quadratic approximation

00:04:30.264 --> 00:04:31.986
is take this entire formula,

00:04:31.986 --> 00:04:34.132
and I'm just literally gonna copy it here,

00:04:34.132 --> 00:04:35.415
and then we're gonna add to it

00:04:35.415 --> 00:04:37.909
so that the second partial
differential information

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:41.638
of our approximation matches
that of the original function.

00:04:41.638 --> 00:04:42.696
Okay, that's kind of a mouthful,

00:04:42.696 --> 00:04:44.951
but it'll become clear as I actually, um,

00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:46.411
as I actually work it out.

00:04:46.411 --> 00:04:48.762
Now, let me just kinda clean it up

00:04:48.762 --> 00:04:50.363
at least a little bit here.

00:04:50.363 --> 00:04:51.783
Um, so what we're gonna do is we're gonna

00:04:51.783 --> 00:04:53.610
extend this, and I'm gonna change its name

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.084
because I don't want it to
be a linear function anymore.

00:04:56.084 --> 00:04:58.623
What I want is for this to
be a quadratic function,

00:04:58.623 --> 00:05:01.704
so instead, I'm gonna call it q of x, y.

00:05:01.704 --> 00:05:03.447
And now we're gonna add some terms,

00:05:03.447 --> 00:05:05.567
and what I could do, what I could do

00:05:05.567 --> 00:05:07.228
is add, you know, a constant

00:05:07.228 --> 00:05:09.641
times x squared, since that's
something we're allowed,

00:05:09.641 --> 00:05:12.490
plus some kind of constant times x, y

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.119
and then another constant times y squared.

00:05:16.119 --> 00:05:17.356
But the problem there, is that,

00:05:17.356 --> 00:05:19.761
if I just add these as they are,

00:05:19.761 --> 00:05:21.208
then it might mess things up when I

00:05:21.208 --> 00:05:23.143
plug-in x knot and y knot, right?

00:05:23.143 --> 00:05:23.976
Well it was very important
that when you plug-in

00:05:23.976 --> 00:05:26.770
those values, that you get the

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.179
original value of the function,

00:05:28.179 --> 00:05:29.644
and that the partial derivatives

00:05:29.644 --> 00:05:32.243
of the approximation also
match that of the function.

00:05:32.243 --> 00:05:33.444
And that could mess things up,

00:05:33.444 --> 00:05:34.538
because once you start plugging in

00:05:34.538 --> 00:05:36.019
x knot and y knot over here,

00:05:36.019 --> 00:05:38.303
that might actually mess with the value.

00:05:38.303 --> 00:05:39.725
So we're basically gonna do the same thing

00:05:39.725 --> 00:05:41.198
we did with the linearization,

00:05:41.198 --> 00:05:42.629
where we put in,

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:44.892
every time we have an
x we kind of attach it,

00:05:44.892 --> 00:05:46.339
we say x minus x knot,

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:48.016
just to make sure that
we don't mess things up

00:05:48.016 --> 00:05:49.811
when we plug-in x knot.

00:05:49.811 --> 00:05:53.360
So instead, instead of
what I had written there,

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.551
what we're gonna add as
our quadratic approximation

00:05:57.551 --> 00:05:58.683
is some kind of constant,

00:05:58.683 --> 00:06:00.196
and we'll fill in that
constant in a moment,

00:06:00.196 --> 00:06:03.113
times x minus x knot squared,

00:06:04.978 --> 00:06:06.718
and then we're gonna add

00:06:06.718 --> 00:06:08.666
another constant multiplied by

00:06:08.666 --> 00:06:10.083
x minus x knot

00:06:11.674 --> 00:06:13.341
times y minus y knot

00:06:16.151 --> 00:06:18.482
and then that times yet another constant,

00:06:18.482 --> 00:06:21.358
which I'll call c multiplied by

00:06:21.358 --> 00:06:23.275
y minus y knot squared.

00:06:26.157 --> 00:06:27.877
All right, this is quite a lot going on.

00:06:27.877 --> 00:06:29.186
This is a heck of a function

00:06:29.186 --> 00:06:30.727
and these are three
different constants that

00:06:30.727 --> 00:06:32.353
we're gonna try to fill in, um,

00:06:32.353 --> 00:06:33.651
to figure out what they should be

00:06:33.651 --> 00:06:37.058
to most closely approximate
the original function f.

00:06:37.058 --> 00:06:38.980
Now the important part of making this

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:41.257
x minus x knot and y minus y knot

00:06:41.257 --> 00:06:42.442
is that when we plug-in here,

00:06:42.442 --> 00:06:43.999
when we plug-in, you know,

00:06:43.999 --> 00:06:46.755
x knot for our variable x

00:06:46.755 --> 00:06:49.666
and when we plug-in y
not for our variable y,

00:06:49.666 --> 00:06:51.477
all of this stuff is just gonna go to zero

00:06:51.477 --> 00:06:52.692
and it's gonna cancel out.

00:06:52.692 --> 00:06:55.067
And moreover, when we take
the partial derivatives,

00:06:55.067 --> 00:06:57.051
all of it's gonna go to zero as well.

00:06:57.051 --> 00:06:58.101
And, and we'll see that in a moment,

00:06:58.101 --> 00:07:01.583
maybe I'll just actually
show that right now.

00:07:01.583 --> 00:07:03.711
Or rather, I think I'll
call the video done here

00:07:03.711 --> 00:07:04.544
and then start talking about

00:07:04.544 --> 00:07:07.505
how we fill in these
constants in the next video.

00:07:07.505 --> 00:07:08.869
So I will see you then.
