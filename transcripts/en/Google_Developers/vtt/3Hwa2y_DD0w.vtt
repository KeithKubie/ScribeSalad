00:00:04.067 --> 00:00:07.234
man: So a little about the--
a little bit about WeatherBug

00:00:07.234 --> 00:00:08.868
as a company and who we are.

00:00:08.868 --> 00:00:13.634
Um, WeatherBug is
a weather information provider

00:00:13.634 --> 00:00:15.868
as you can probably guess
by our name.

00:00:15.868 --> 00:00:18.601
And what makes us different
is that we have a network

00:00:18.601 --> 00:00:19.868
of weather stations.

00:00:19.868 --> 00:00:23.300
We have
around 8,000 weather stations

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.367
across the United States.

00:00:25.367 --> 00:00:26.934
500 in Canada.

00:00:26.934 --> 00:00:29.968
And those weather stations

00:00:29.968 --> 00:00:31.868
produce live real-time
information

00:00:31.868 --> 00:00:33.133
for your neighborhood.

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:35.501
So we also gather data
from airports,

00:00:35.501 --> 00:00:38.434
but, you know,
the WeatherBug network makes it

00:00:38.434 --> 00:00:42.167
much more granular information
for your neighborhood.

00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:44.968
We also have cameras
on a certain number

00:00:44.968 --> 00:00:48.734
of those weather stations,
about 1,500 cameras.

00:00:48.734 --> 00:00:52.234
And we also added lightning
detection to our network

00:00:52.234 --> 00:00:53.934
just this past year.

00:00:53.934 --> 00:00:56.567
And we hope to build

00:00:56.567 --> 00:00:58.801
the most accurate
lightning detection network

00:00:58.801 --> 00:01:02.501
that's available.

00:01:02.501 --> 00:01:05.567
man: So you chose the Android
platform to create this app.

00:01:05.567 --> 00:01:08.834
Tell us a bit about how you came
to the technical decision

00:01:08.834 --> 00:01:11.033
to do that.

00:01:11.033 --> 00:01:15.033
man: So we chose
Android platform to build

00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:19.200
our WeatherBug application,

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.467
you know, mainly,
for WeatherBug,

00:01:21.467 --> 00:01:24.300
since the data's very local,
and when you're out

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.434
walking around with your mobile
phone and you want to get

00:01:27.434 --> 00:01:30.267
the most accurate weather
information, um,

00:01:30.267 --> 00:01:33.567
you know, we wanted to be able
to provide live real-time data

00:01:33.567 --> 00:01:35.133
to the application.

00:01:35.133 --> 00:01:36.734
So we built, you know,

00:01:36.734 --> 00:01:38.968
a native application that runs
on Android.

00:01:38.968 --> 00:01:41.501
The data updates
every few seconds.

00:01:41.501 --> 00:01:42.701
You can get maps,

00:01:42.701 --> 00:01:44.701
you can get
your hourly forecast,

00:01:44.701 --> 00:01:47.901
your daily forecast,
directly from the phone.

00:01:47.901 --> 00:01:52.501
It's able to run
in the background on a phone

00:01:52.501 --> 00:01:54.901
and so that we can send
severe weather alerts

00:01:54.901 --> 00:01:58.501
directly to the phone,
so no matter where you travel,

00:01:58.501 --> 00:02:02.901
it uses location-based portions
of the phone

00:02:02.901 --> 00:02:05.167
to automatically gather
your location

00:02:05.167 --> 00:02:07.767
and automatically send you
severe weather alerts

00:02:07.767 --> 00:02:09.267
based on that location.

00:02:09.267 --> 00:02:11.767
man: Yeah, and it's that
the strategy is mobile, right,

00:02:11.767 --> 00:02:14.667
because weather is something
you really can take mobile.

00:02:14.667 --> 00:02:16.834
And when a new platform
like Android comes out,

00:02:16.834 --> 00:02:19.767
it's obvious--
it's an obvious choice.

00:02:19.767 --> 00:02:23.701
It's also--we can do
powerful stuff

00:02:23.701 --> 00:02:26.234
on a platform like Android.

00:02:26.234 --> 00:02:29.334
man: Uh, what specific tips
and tricks did you use

00:02:29.334 --> 00:02:31.200
in your application?

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.567
You mentioned the temperature...

00:02:33.567 --> 00:02:36.167
man: Oh, yeah. Yeah.

00:02:36.167 --> 00:02:38.000
man: Any other tics--
tips or tricks?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.434
man: Tips and tricks.
Um...

00:02:43.434 --> 00:02:45.367
Um...

00:02:48.534 --> 00:02:52.000
I'm not sure what--
I guess the notification, right?

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.434
We came up with a, I guess,
maybe not that clever, right,

00:02:55.434 --> 00:03:00.167
but using the alarm manager
so we don't use

00:03:00.167 --> 00:03:01.234
any battery at all.

00:03:01.234 --> 00:03:02.400
The application starts up,

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.567
hands it off
to the notification system,

00:03:04.567 --> 00:03:05.868
and forgets about it.

00:03:05.868 --> 00:03:08.033
And the next time
the application needs to update,

00:03:08.033 --> 00:03:10.367
it will start up.

00:03:10.367 --> 00:03:14.634
And, of course, I think maybe,
maybe, sort of,

00:03:14.634 --> 00:03:16.501
a major thing is our UI.

00:03:16.501 --> 00:03:18.467
We think we came up
with a good idea for--

00:03:18.467 --> 00:03:22.567
so you have a very map-centric
view where you can easily switch

00:03:22.567 --> 00:03:23.901
between locations.

00:03:23.901 --> 00:03:28.167
So I think maybe the way
we do the location switching

00:03:28.167 --> 00:03:33.000
and the maps
and then stuff like that.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.634
man: Yeah.

00:03:36.634 --> 00:03:38.367
man:
Uh, what's your favorite aspect

00:03:38.367 --> 00:03:42.367
of the Android development
process?

00:03:42.367 --> 00:03:45.267
man: Well, the favorite aspect
is it's Java.

00:03:45.267 --> 00:03:46.501
We love Java.

00:03:46.501 --> 00:03:49.934
And also that it's so easy.

00:03:49.934 --> 00:03:53.267
Um, it's very easy to set up,

00:03:53.267 --> 00:03:54.801
and it's very easy
to get started.

00:03:54.801 --> 00:03:59.667
So I would say, uh...

00:03:59.667 --> 00:04:02.467
And also
that it's a powerful platform.

00:04:02.467 --> 00:04:05.467
You can do--you can do
whatever you want to do.

00:04:05.467 --> 00:04:08.801
And, I mean,
if you have an idea

00:04:08.801 --> 00:04:12.634
to develop something,
it's--you sort of--

00:04:12.634 --> 00:04:13.801
I don't know how
to express this,

00:04:13.801 --> 00:04:15.934
but you can do--
for instance,

00:04:15.934 --> 00:04:17.634
we do a lot on very simple
phones

00:04:17.634 --> 00:04:22.834
that's very limited--it's very
limited what you can do.

00:04:22.834 --> 00:04:25.000
So you always have
this trade-off.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.334
On Android, of course,
at some point,

00:04:27.334 --> 00:04:28.801
you have a--you can--

00:04:28.801 --> 00:04:31.501
there's some speed
and some screen size factors,

00:04:31.501 --> 00:04:35.434
but, you know,
it's a powerful device.

00:04:35.434 --> 00:04:38.968
man: It's a great phone
for getting your app out

00:04:38.968 --> 00:04:41.534
with the market, you know,
being--

00:04:41.534 --> 00:04:44.267
being able to be front
and center and, for everybody

00:04:44.267 --> 00:04:47.868
that has the phone, to be able
to just get your app

00:04:47.868 --> 00:04:49.567
and get immediate feedback
from people.

00:04:49.567 --> 00:04:51.567
I mean,
we have amazing customers

00:04:51.567 --> 00:04:53.400
that have downloaded it
and given us feedback.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.968
And, you know, we're able
to react to that

00:04:55.968 --> 00:04:58.734
and add features
and fix bugs or whatever it is

00:04:58.734 --> 00:05:02.767
that people report to us,
so it's been

00:05:02.767 --> 00:05:03.868
a great platform to develop on.

00:05:03.868 --> 00:05:05.133
man: And a good point
is the market

00:05:05.133 --> 00:05:07.133
because as soon as we have
a new release,

00:05:07.133 --> 00:05:10.367
we just upload that application,
and it's available

00:05:10.367 --> 00:05:11.767
to the user right away.

00:05:11.767 --> 00:05:15.501
And that is not something
you can do with other markets

00:05:15.501 --> 00:05:19.400
or platforms.
man: Yeah.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.868
man: Uh, are there any features
that you can do

00:05:21.868 --> 00:05:25.367
in your app that you can't do
on other platforms?

00:05:25.367 --> 00:05:26.968
man: Uh, any features
that we can do in this app

00:05:26.968 --> 00:05:29.000
that you can't do
on other platforms we have?

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.534
Um, now less,
but in the beginning,

00:05:32.534 --> 00:05:35.634
the Android application was
actually sort of the template

00:05:35.634 --> 00:05:36.901
for all our applications.

00:05:36.901 --> 00:05:39.601
Now we have other platforms
like Windows Mobile

00:05:39.601 --> 00:05:41.701
and iPhone.

00:05:41.701 --> 00:05:44.634
So, um...

00:05:44.634 --> 00:05:48.701
so, yeah, it laid the groundwork
for the other applications.

00:05:48.701 --> 00:05:51.801
man: Yup, user interface-wise,
the ease of building

00:05:51.801 --> 00:05:54.601
the user interface, I think,
and all the elements

00:05:54.601 --> 00:05:57.567
behind that are what
kind of gave us our impetus

00:05:57.567 --> 00:06:00.601
to what we're developing
across the board really

00:06:00.601 --> 00:06:03.133
for all of
our mobile applications.

00:06:03.133 --> 00:06:04.300
So...

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.467
man: Yeah, and then, of course,
the widgets--

00:06:06.467 --> 00:06:08.534
the widgets we don't have
on--

00:06:08.534 --> 00:06:09.801
man: Sure.

00:06:09.801 --> 00:06:11.400
man: We have, but not
in that way, yeah.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.067
Temperature next to the clock.

00:06:14.067 --> 00:06:15.767
We don't have that
on all platforms,

00:06:15.767 --> 00:06:18.033
so that is also
an Android-specific thing.

00:06:18.033 --> 00:06:21.000
We try to do it, but not all
the platforms can do it.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.868
man: Correct. Yeah.
man: Yeah.

00:06:23.868 --> 00:06:26.100
man: All right, gentlemen, well,
I appreciate your time today.

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.234
man: Absolutely.

00:06:27.234 --> 00:06:28.434
man: And I hope you have
a wonderful conference.

00:06:28.434 --> 00:06:29.968
man: Yeah.
It's a great conference. Thanks.
