00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:02.700
Let me get this straight. We have our genome, which

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.410
contains our genes, that are transcribed and translated into proteins.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.870
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.380
&gt;&gt; But, we cut out entire sections, which are introns.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.840
And, we only translate between the start and stop codons?

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.050
&gt;&gt; That's exactly right. And on top

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.020
of that, there's more DNA sequence called the

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.050
promoter region. That doesn't code for any

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.170
protein and just controls the initiation of transcription.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.790
&gt;&gt; Okay, but how much of the genome actually turns into

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:26.810
proteins in the end?

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.300
&gt;&gt; That's a really good question. Why don't you

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.130
take a crack at it. Even if you don't know

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.940
the answer, just pick from one of the following. How

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.910
much of the genome do you think codes for protein?
