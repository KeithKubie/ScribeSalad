say just look at the source code for the

00:10:05.079 --> 00:10:05.089
say just look at the source code for the
 

00:10:05.089 --> 00:10:08.320
say just look at the source code for the
music app you can get source code to

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:08.330
music app you can get source code to
 

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:11.079
music app you can get source code to
Google music mm-hmm it should be under

00:10:11.079 --> 00:10:11.089
Google music mm-hmm it should be under
 

00:10:11.089 --> 00:10:13.000
Google music mm-hmm it should be under
the packages of the open-source project

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:13.010
the packages of the open-source project
 

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:16.360
the packages of the open-source project
I think you can get the source code for

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:16.370
I think you can get the source code for
 

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:18.400
I think you can get the source code for
the old music app but not like Google

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:18.410

well before it went Google music music
hmm yeah so it's possible that those

00:10:35.829 --> 00:10:35.839
hmm yeah so it's possible that those
 

00:10:35.839 --> 00:10:38.750
hmm yeah so it's possible that those
guys are using

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:38.760
 

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:42.770
and it's possible that those guys aren't

and it's possible that those guys aren't
 

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:44.300
and it's possible that those guys aren't
using the high level Bluetooth api's

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:44.310
using the high level Bluetooth api's
 

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:47.900
using the high level Bluetooth api's
they mail while we're doing it even

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:47.910
they mail while we're doing it even
 

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:49.660
they mail while we're doing it even

Bluetooth connections and sending the

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:51.630
Bluetooth connections and sending the
 

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:52.940
Bluetooth connections and sending the
data across I'm not I don't know I

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:52.950
data across I'm not I don't know I
 

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:55.310

haven't seen any high level Bluetooth

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:55.320
haven't seen any high level Bluetooth
 

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:58.330
haven't seen any high level Bluetooth
api's for doing anything like that okay

00:10:58.330 --> 00:10:58.340
api's for doing anything like that okay
 

00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:02.950
api's for doing anything like that okay
so I should just post a stack overflow

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:02.960
 

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.210
yeah if no one has already written an

00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:05.220
yeah if no one has already written an
 

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:06.560
yeah if no one has already written an
implementation which can do what you

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:06.570
implementation which can do what you
 

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:07.910
implementation which can do what you
want it may be quite tricky to write

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:07.920
want it may be quite tricky to write
 

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:11.870
want it may be quite tricky to write
that I guess if you ask it then someone

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:11.880
that I guess if you ask it then someone
 

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.070
that I guess if you ask it then someone
who might have more experience at a

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:13.080
who might have more experience at a
 

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.050
who might have more experience at a
different level Bluetooth or various

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:15.060
different level Bluetooth or various
 

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:20.030
different level Bluetooth or various
things and it may not be a case you get

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:20.040
things and it may not be a case you get
 

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.010
things and it may not be a case you get
the B on sir but people might be able to

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:22.020
the B on sir but people might be able to
 

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:23.450
the B on sir but people might be able to
guide you just give me better start

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:23.460
guide you just give me better start
 

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:24.950
guide you just give me better start
thinking about it looking about it other

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:24.960

flow and so I kind of I'm going to take

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:18.720
flow and so I kind of I'm going to take
 

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.030
flow and so I kind of I'm going to take
a bit issue with the question here which

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:20.040
a bit issue with the question here which
 

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.290
a bit issue with the question here which
is we bring back the programmatic

00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:21.300
is we bring back the programmatic
 

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:23.690
is we bring back the programmatic
chromatic API 410 or flight mode and I

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:23.700
chromatic API 410 or flight mode and I
 

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:25.280
chromatic API 410 or flight mode and I
would actually argue that there never

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:25.290
would actually argue that there never
 

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:28.190
would actually argue that there never
was a programmatic API like you know

00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:28.200
was a programmatic API like you know
 

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.990
was a programmatic API like you know
explicit API for turning on off the

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:30.000
explicit API for turning on off the
 

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.730
explicit API for turning on off the
flight mode people worked out how to

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:31.740
flight mode people worked out how to
 

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:33.860
flight mode people worked out how to
poke a value into a settings table and

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:33.870
poke a value into a settings table and
 

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:36.080
poke a value into a settings table and
do something else and it for it to take

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:36.090
do something else and it for it to take
 

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:37.430
do something else and it for it to take
effect that was never actually a

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:37.440
effect that was never actually a
 

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.890
effect that was never actually a
documented API I would say people kind

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:39.900
documented API I would say people kind
 

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:41.210
documented API I would say people kind
of working out how to do it isn't isn't

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:41.220
of working out how to do it isn't isn't
 

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:42.560
of working out how to do it isn't isn't
really the same thing I'd say when we

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:42.570
really the same thing I'd say when we
 

00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:44.690
really the same thing I'd say when we
have an actual API like a connectivity

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:44.700
have an actual API like a connectivity
 

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:47.780
have an actual API like a connectivity
manager dot whatever and you know that's

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:47.790
manager dot whatever and you know that's
 

00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:49.520
manager dot whatever and you know that's
a commitment for us to support and say

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:49.530
a commitment for us to support and say
 

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:52.490
a commitment for us to support and say
this is how you do such a thing so I

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:52.500
this is how you do such a thing so I
 

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:55.730
this is how you do such a thing so I
think that's why we kind of felt able to

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:55.740
think that's why we kind of felt able to
 

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:58.640
think that's why we kind of felt able to
move where it was and perhaps you know

00:13:58.640 --> 00:13:58.650
move where it was and perhaps you know
 

00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:00.200
move where it was and perhaps you know
some applications may no longer be able

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:00.210
some applications may no longer be able
 

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:02.240
some applications may no longer be able
to turn on flight mode but that's just

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:02.250
to turn on flight mode but that's just
 

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:06.410
to turn on flight mode but that's just
the way it is so yeah that's the kind of

00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:06.420
the way it is so yeah that's the kind of
 

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:09.890
the way it is so yeah that's the kind of
a long answer saying that yeah there's

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:09.900
a long answer saying that yeah there's
 

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:10.790
a long answer saying that yeah there's
nothing we're not gonna bring it back

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:10.800
nothing we're not gonna bring it back
 

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.130
nothing we're not gonna bring it back
doing the kind of existed but and the

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:13.140
doing the kind of existed but and the
 

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:14.510
doing the kind of existed but and the
second part of this question asks is

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:14.520
second part of this question asks is
 

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.370
second part of this question asks is
there a way to ask for such improvements

00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:16.380
there a way to ask for such improvements
 

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:18.740
there a way to ask for such improvements
and the answer is yes so if you go to is

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:18.750
and the answer is yes so if you go to is
 

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:20.840
and the answer is yes so if you go to is
it beaver Android comm which is where

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:20.850
it beaver Android comm which is where
 

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:22.550

and product managers read them all and
 

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:44.750

does that mean you can ask questions

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:22.950
does that mean you can ask questions
 

00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:37.040
does that mean you can ask questions

obviously we don't really comment on

00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:39.870
obviously we don't really comment on

obviously we don't really comment on
search algorithms things like that but

00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:42.660
search algorithms things like that but
 

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:45.200
search algorithms things like that but
the search algorithms are based on a

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:45.210
the search algorithms are based on a
 

00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:46.880
the search algorithms are based on a
huge number of criteria that are there

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:46.890
huge number of criteria that are there
 

00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:50.180
huge number of criteria that are there
to produce on maths the best results for

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:50.190
to produce on maths the best results for

it's the it's an iterated algorithm to
provide good results for users in search

00:18:03.169 --> 00:18:03.179
provide good results for users in search
 

00:18:03.179 --> 00:18:05.180
provide good results for users in search
okay and just like our Google search we

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:05.190
okay and just like our Google search we
 

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:08.030
okay and just like our Google search we
don't go into the exact details of which

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:08.040
don't go into the exact details of which
 

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:10.490
don't go into the exact details of which
you know factors are kind of contribute

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:10.500
you know factors are kind of contribute
 

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.590
you know factors are kind of contribute
to it I mean that's kind of our secret

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:12.600
to it I mean that's kind of our secret
 

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:14.720
to it I mean that's kind of our secret
sauce and also probably wrong because

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:14.730

we're always tweaking this algorithm to
 

00:18:18.179 --> 00:18:19.640
we're always tweaking this algorithm to
try and try and you know produce the

try and try and you know produce the
best possible search results so yeah

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:21.570
best possible search results so yeah
 

00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:24.230
best possible search results so yeah
we're not gonna be able to that you'll

balance the same goes for the category

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:01.890
balance the same goes for the category
 

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:03.799
balance the same goes for the category
rankings as well and I think it's doing

00:19:03.799 --> 00:19:03.809
rankings as well and I think it's doing
 

00:19:03.809 --> 00:19:05.120
rankings as well and I think it's doing
the right job I mean just because he is

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:05.130
the right job I mean just because he is
 

00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:06.590
the right job I mean just because he is
the exact match for the title doesn't

00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:06.600
the exact match for the title doesn't
 

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:07.970
the exact match for the title doesn't
mean it's the best match for the search

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:07.980
mean it's the best match for the search
 

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.370
mean it's the best match for the search
term right I mean I could very easily

00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:10.380
term right I mean I could very easily
 

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:11.990
term right I mean I could very easily
spam the search results just by putting

00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:12.000
spam the search results just by putting
 

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.780
spam the search results just by putting
exact matches for no you know for car in

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:14.790
exact matches for no you know for car in
 

00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:16.159
exact matches for no you know for car in
there and hopefully my app would go to

00:19:16.159 --> 00:19:16.169
there and hopefully my app would go to
 

00:19:16.169 --> 00:19:17.810
there and hopefully my app would go to
the top but actually it should be at the

00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:17.820
the top but actually it should be at the
 

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:20.690
the top but actually it should be at the
very very bottom at 700,000 until it has

00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:20.700
very very bottom at 700,000 until it has
 

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:22.220
very very bottom at 700,000 until it has
some traffic and some reviews and so I

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:22.230
some traffic and some reviews and so I
 

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:24.289
some traffic and some reviews and so I
know it's not it's not ideal for some

00:19:24.289 --> 00:19:24.299
know it's not it's not ideal for some
 

00:19:24.299 --> 00:19:28.970
know it's not it's not ideal for some
people it works very well for each other

00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:28.980
people it works very well for each other
 

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:31.399
people it works very well for each other

00:19:31.399 --> 00:19:31.409
you know the name of the allocation I
 

00:19:31.409 --> 00:19:32.989
you know the name of the allocation I
will not say here because

00:19:32.989 --> 00:19:32.999
will not say here because
 

00:19:32.999 --> 00:19:35.899
will not say here because
it's not correct but if you try to make

00:19:35.899 --> 00:19:35.909
it's not correct but if you try to make
 

00:19:35.909 --> 00:19:38.419

the research on the on the Google Play
 

00:19:38.429 --> 00:19:40.729
the research on the on the Google Play
market you will understand what I mean

you will see many many many applications

00:19:43.219 --> 00:19:43.229
you will see many many many applications
 

00:19:43.229 --> 00:19:45.379
you will see many many many applications

second page and this for me is a very
 

00:19:50.729 --> 00:19:53.029
second page and this for me is a very
strange it's like I'm looking for

00:20:02.419 --> 00:20:02.429
it you know I say that the issue with
 

00:20:02.429 --> 00:20:04.459
it you know I say that the issue with
that is almost the second word of the

00:20:04.459 --> 00:20:04.469
that is almost the second word of the
 

00:20:04.469 --> 00:20:06.439
that is almost the second word of the
application name here is sooo generic

00:20:06.439 --> 00:20:06.449
application name here is sooo generic
 

00:20:06.449 --> 00:20:08.839
application name here is sooo generic
very matching that second word the one

00:20:08.839 --> 00:20:08.849
very matching that second word the one
 

00:20:08.849 --> 00:20:12.729
very matching that second word the one
no it's do leads to common words but

00:20:12.729 --> 00:20:12.739
no it's do leads to common words but
 

00:20:12.739 --> 00:20:17.299
no it's do leads to common words but
move together only mine the two words

00:20:17.299 --> 00:20:17.309
move together only mine the two words
 

00:20:17.309 --> 00:20:20.359
move together only mine the two words
together if I put quotes around the two

00:20:20.359 --> 00:20:20.369
together if I put quotes around the two
 

00:20:20.369 --> 00:20:21.919
together if I put quotes around the two
words of the application they yeah but

00:20:21.919 --> 00:20:21.929
words of the application they yeah but
 

00:20:21.929 --> 00:20:23.779
words of the application they yeah but
could see support professional does it

00:20:23.779 --> 00:20:23.789
could see support professional does it
 

00:20:23.789 --> 00:20:26.569

is not for as you search is done by

00:20:26.569 --> 00:20:26.579
is not for as you search is done by
 

00:20:26.579 --> 00:20:29.269
is not for as you search is done by
individual words and you can't hope to

00:20:29.269 --> 00:20:29.279
individual words and you can't hope to
 

00:20:29.279 --> 00:20:30.789
individual words and you can't hope to
come near the top for the word Pro

00:20:30.789 --> 00:20:30.799
come near the top for the word Pro
 

00:20:30.799 --> 00:20:35.419
come near the top for the word Pro
unless you're changing yeah I've had

00:20:35.419 --> 00:20:35.429
unless you're changing yeah I've had
 

00:20:35.429 --> 00:20:42.949
unless you're changing yeah I've had
this one of my UPS where I had I did was

00:20:42.949 --> 00:20:42.959
this one of my UPS where I had I did was
 

00:20:42.959 --> 00:20:44.479
this one of my UPS where I had I did was
just make sure I had a good description

00:20:44.479 --> 00:20:44.489
just make sure I had a good description
 

00:20:44.489 --> 00:20:46.819
just make sure I had a good description
had a good title and everything make

00:20:46.819 --> 00:20:46.829
had a good title and everything make
 

00:20:46.829 --> 00:20:48.259
had a good title and everything make
sense if you're not I just left it and

00:20:48.259 --> 00:20:48.269
sense if you're not I just left it and
 

00:20:48.269 --> 00:20:50.479
sense if you're not I just left it and
eventually my acted just kind of filter

00:20:50.479 --> 00:20:50.489
eventually my acted just kind of filter
 

00:20:50.489 --> 00:20:52.909
eventually my acted just kind of filter
its way up to the top but I did notice

00:20:52.909 --> 00:20:52.919
its way up to the top but I did notice
 

00:20:52.919 --> 00:20:55.009
its way up to the top but I did notice
that the pay team they were adjusting it

00:20:55.009 --> 00:20:55.019
that the pay team they were adjusting it
 

00:20:55.019 --> 00:20:56.899
that the pay team they were adjusting it
and changing the algorithm and yeah I

00:20:56.899 --> 00:20:56.909
and changing the algorithm and yeah I
 

00:20:56.909 --> 00:20:58.729
and changing the algorithm and yeah I
don't think you can do to force it just

00:20:58.729 --> 00:20:58.739
don't think you can do to force it just
 

00:20:58.739 --> 00:21:01.729
don't think you can do to force it just
do what is right and just stick with

00:21:01.729 --> 00:21:01.739
do what is right and just stick with
 

00:21:01.739 --> 00:21:04.069
do what is right and just stick with
that and I'd say Pro is kind of a

00:21:04.069 --> 00:21:04.079
that and I'd say Pro is kind of a
 

00:21:04.079 --> 00:21:08.379
that and I'd say Pro is kind of a
generic term he's a bit bad yeah yeah

00:21:08.379 --> 00:21:08.389
generic term he's a bit bad yeah yeah
 

00:21:08.389 --> 00:21:10.339
generic term he's a bit bad yeah yeah
obviously we're not going to be able to

00:21:10.339 --> 00:21:10.349
obviously we're not going to be able to
 

00:21:10.349 --> 00:21:12.919
obviously we're not going to be able to
influence that algorithm we can let the

00:21:12.919 --> 00:21:12.929
influence that algorithm we can let the
 

00:21:12.929 --> 00:21:15.139
influence that algorithm we can let the
team know but and then regarding the

00:21:15.139 --> 00:21:15.149
team know but and then regarding the
 

00:21:15.149 --> 00:21:18.019
team know but and then regarding the
reviews yes previously anyone could type

00:21:18.019 --> 00:21:18.029
reviews yes previously anyone could type
 

00:21:18.029 --> 00:21:19.789
reviews yes previously anyone could type
any name they wanted into that box and

00:21:19.789 --> 00:21:19.799
any name they wanted into that box and
 

00:21:19.799 --> 00:21:22.369
any name they wanted into that box and
they were unverified so I could go in

00:21:22.369 --> 00:21:22.379
they were unverified so I could go in
 

00:21:22.379 --> 00:21:24.679
they were unverified so I could go in
and put just let people Shelly in as the

00:21:24.679 --> 00:21:24.689
and put just let people Shelly in as the
 

00:21:24.689 --> 00:21:26.959
and put just let people Shelly in as the
reviewer and say whatever I wanted about

against the Google account the real
 

00:21:41.429 --> 00:21:44.089
against the Google account the real
identity that they logged in with so it

00:21:44.089 --> 00:21:44.099
identity that they logged in with so it
 

00:21:44.099 --> 00:21:45.619
identity that they logged in with so it
should be better for conversations for

00:21:45.619 --> 00:21:45.629
should be better for conversations for
 

00:21:45.629 --> 00:21:46.250
should be better for conversations for

another way to fetch the data right or

00:31:46.669 --> 00:31:46.679
another way to fetch the data right or
 

00:31:46.679 --> 00:31:49.690
another way to fetch the data right or
is it more than meets the eye

00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:49.700
is it more than meets the eye
 

00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:51.650
is it more than meets the eye
no that's exactly right it's an

00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:51.660
no that's exactly right it's an
 

00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:54.590
no that's exactly right it's an
alternative to distinct worry on the

00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:54.600
alternative to distinct worry on the
 

00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:58.299
alternative to distinct worry on the
content resolver but it's a bit smarter

00:31:58.299 --> 00:31:58.309
content resolver but it's a bit smarter
 

00:31:58.309 --> 00:32:05.780
content resolver but it's a bit smarter
so basically I don't have an an

00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:05.790
so basically I don't have an an
 

00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:08.480
so basically I don't have an an
obligation to use loaders if I can

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:08.490
obligation to use loaders if I can
 

00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:10.160
obligation to use loaders if I can
handle all the configuration changes

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:10.170
handle all the configuration changes
 

00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:14.810
handle all the configuration changes
myself in an obligation it's just

00:32:14.810 --> 00:32:14.820
myself in an obligation it's just
 

00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:16.340
myself in an obligation it's just
convenience is there to help make it

00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:16.350
convenience is there to help make it
 

00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:18.260
convenience is there to help make it
easier for you yeah but I mean in

00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:18.270
easier for you yeah but I mean in
 

00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:21.200
easier for you yeah but I mean in
performance wise is it better than using

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:21.210
performance wise is it better than using
 

00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:25.130
performance wise is it better than using
our own check for configuration changes

00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:25.140
our own check for configuration changes
 

00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:27.919
our own check for configuration changes
and because basically all I do is fetch

00:32:27.919 --> 00:32:27.929
and because basically all I do is fetch
 

00:32:27.929 --> 00:32:31.640
and because basically all I do is fetch
the data first time upon login to see if

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:31.650
the data first time upon login to see if
 

00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:34.940
the data first time upon login to see if
the contact list is changed and then

00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:34.950
the contact list is changed and then
 

00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:37.250
the contact list is changed and then
basically do all the manipulations

00:32:37.250 --> 00:32:37.260
basically do all the manipulations
 

00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:38.909
basically do all the manipulations
myself

00:32:38.909 --> 00:32:38.919
myself
 

00:32:38.919 --> 00:32:42.299
myself
and switch from our adapter to another

00:32:42.299 --> 00:32:42.309
and switch from our adapter to another
 

00:32:42.309 --> 00:32:46.529
and switch from our adapter to another
list viewer so on and so all the data is

00:32:46.529 --> 00:32:46.539
list viewer so on and so all the data is
 

00:32:46.539 --> 00:32:50.849
list viewer so on and so all the data is
always on on the list view or an adapter

00:32:50.849 --> 00:32:50.859
always on on the list view or an adapter
 

00:32:50.859 --> 00:32:54.960
always on on the list view or an adapter
so today you'll see it's gonna be a

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:54.970
so today you'll see it's gonna be a
 

00:32:54.970 --> 00:32:56.190
so today you'll see it's gonna be a
better performance the answer's yes I

00:32:56.190 --> 00:32:56.200
better performance the answer's yes I
 

00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:59.099
better performance the answer's yes I
didn't know because the the joy of load

00:32:59.099 --> 00:32:59.109
didn't know because the the joy of load
 

00:32:59.109 --> 00:33:00.720
didn't know because the the joy of load
is is it takes care of a lot of work for

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:00.730
is is it takes care of a lot of work for
 

00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:04.379
is is it takes care of a lot of work for
you right so it just like the content

00:33:04.379 --> 00:33:04.389
you right so it just like the content
 

00:33:04.389 --> 00:33:06.539
you right so it just like the content
observer for you for example so for me

00:33:06.539 --> 00:33:06.549
observer for you for example so for me
 

00:33:06.549 --> 00:33:08.009
observer for you for example so for me
that's one of the joys that you can

00:33:08.009 --> 00:33:08.019
that's one of the joys that you can
 

00:33:08.019 --> 00:33:10.710
that's one of the joys that you can
decouple your kind of say you're doing a

00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:10.720
decouple your kind of say you're doing a
 

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:12.840
decouple your kind of say you're doing a
acquiring a rest service you can just

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:12.850
acquiring a rest service you can just
 

00:33:12.850 --> 00:33:14.369
acquiring a rest service you can just
fire it off to an intent service and

00:33:14.369 --> 00:33:14.379
fire it off to an intent service and
 

00:33:14.379 --> 00:33:15.840
fire it off to an intent service and
have the intent service retrieve

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:15.850
have the intent service retrieve
 

00:33:15.850 --> 00:33:17.460
have the intent service retrieve
information and put it into the content

00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:17.470
information and put it into the content
 

00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:19.560
information and put it into the content
provider and you don't have to worry

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:19.570
provider and you don't have to worry
 

00:33:19.570 --> 00:33:21.060
provider and you don't have to worry
about then try to touch the UI because

00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:21.070
about then try to touch the UI because
 

00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:22.680
about then try to touch the UI because
because the loaders implemented a

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:22.690
because the loaders implemented a
 

00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:24.989
because the loaders implemented a
Content observer for you it'll just see

00:33:24.989 --> 00:33:24.999
Content observer for you it'll just see
 

00:33:24.999 --> 00:33:27.629
Content observer for you it'll just see
the change to the on the content URI and

00:33:27.629 --> 00:33:27.639
the change to the on the content URI and
 

00:33:27.639 --> 00:33:30.840
the change to the on the content URI and
re query and update your URI for your UI

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:30.850
re query and update your URI for your UI
 

00:33:30.850 --> 00:33:32.940
re query and update your URI for your UI
for you so you don't have to then you

00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:32.950
for you so you don't have to then you
 

00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:34.560
for you so you don't have to then you
know get into the messy logic of result

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:34.570
know get into the messy logic of result
 

00:33:34.570 --> 00:33:36.239
know get into the messy logic of result
receivers and so on trying to ping back

00:33:36.239 --> 00:33:36.249
receivers and so on trying to ping back
 

00:33:36.249 --> 00:33:37.649
receivers and so on trying to ping back
from your intent service back to your

00:33:37.649 --> 00:33:37.659
from your intent service back to your
 

00:33:37.659 --> 00:33:40.289
from your intent service back to your
activity yes the kind of the joy of it

00:33:40.289 --> 00:33:40.299
activity yes the kind of the joy of it
 

00:33:40.299 --> 00:33:41.940
activity yes the kind of the joy of it
is it kind of handles a lot of that for

00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:41.950
is it kind of handles a lot of that for
 

00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:43.320
is it kind of handles a lot of that for
you and like you say handles and

00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:43.330
you and like you say handles and
 

00:33:43.330 --> 00:33:45.119
you and like you say handles and
configuration changes gracefully for you

00:33:45.119 --> 00:33:45.129
configuration changes gracefully for you
 

00:33:45.129 --> 00:33:48.629
configuration changes gracefully for you
as well so if you don't need any of that

00:33:48.629 --> 00:33:48.639
as well so if you don't need any of that
 

00:33:48.639 --> 00:33:52.259
as well so if you don't need any of that
and then don't use it I mean you know I

00:33:52.259 --> 00:33:52.269
and then don't use it I mean you know I
 

00:33:52.269 --> 00:33:56.450
and then don't use it I mean you know I
mean we most likely every app that uses

00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:56.460
mean we most likely every app that uses
 

00:33:56.460 --> 00:34:00.269
mean we most likely every app that uses
fetching from the internet and showing

00:34:00.269 --> 00:34:00.279
fetching from the internet and showing
 

00:34:00.279 --> 00:34:02.869
fetching from the internet and showing
list views and so on needs it but on

00:34:02.869 --> 00:34:02.879
list views and so on needs it but on
 

00:34:02.879 --> 00:34:05.669
list views and so on needs it but on
different levels because I can do all

00:34:05.669 --> 00:34:05.679
different levels because I can do all
 

00:34:05.679 --> 00:34:07.859
different levels because I can do all
the configuration changes and live

00:34:07.859 --> 00:34:07.869
the configuration changes and live
 

00:34:07.869 --> 00:34:11.339
the configuration changes and live
myself and basically if I use an area

00:34:11.339 --> 00:34:11.349
myself and basically if I use an area
 

00:34:11.349 --> 00:34:16.289
myself and basically if I use an area
adapter or a cursor adapter to hold the

00:34:16.289 --> 00:34:16.299
adapter or a cursor adapter to hold the
 

00:34:16.299 --> 00:34:19.770
adapter or a cursor adapter to hold the
data and as long as a persistent data as

00:34:19.770 --> 00:34:19.780
data and as long as a persistent data as
 

00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:21.389
data and as long as a persistent data as
long as the application is on the

00:34:21.389 --> 00:34:21.399
long as the application is on the
 

00:34:21.399 --> 00:34:24.389
long as the application is on the
foreground then I don't see why Lourdes

00:34:24.389 --> 00:34:24.399
foreground then I don't see why Lourdes
 

00:34:24.399 --> 00:34:28.440
foreground then I don't see why Lourdes
is better that's what I mean that's what

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:28.450
is better that's what I mean that's what
 

00:34:28.450 --> 00:34:32.059
is better that's what I mean that's what
I wanted to verify with you guys yeah

00:34:32.059 --> 00:34:32.069
I wanted to verify with you guys yeah
 

00:34:32.069 --> 00:34:38.220
I wanted to verify with you guys yeah
okay thanks I guess one-one of argument

00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:38.230
okay thanks I guess one-one of argument
 

00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:40.980
okay thanks I guess one-one of argument
might be though that if he if if it

00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:40.990
might be though that if he if if it
 

00:34:40.990 --> 00:34:42.299
might be though that if he if if it
changes in the future that you might

00:34:42.299 --> 00:34:42.309
changes in the future that you might
 

00:34:42.309 --> 00:34:43.829
changes in the future that you might
want to watch for two content changes or

00:34:43.829 --> 00:34:43.839
want to watch for two content changes or
 

00:34:43.839 --> 00:34:46.859
want to watch for two content changes or
things like that then you know you were

00:34:46.859 --> 00:34:46.869
things like that then you know you were
 

00:34:46.869 --> 00:34:47.940
things like that then you know you were
then going to have to change all your

00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:47.950
then going to have to change all your
 

00:34:47.950 --> 00:34:49.349
then going to have to change all your
code and write all that stuff for you

00:34:49.349 --> 00:34:49.359
code and write all that stuff for you
 

00:34:49.359 --> 00:34:51.180
code and write all that stuff for you
whereas loaders are pretty easy to

00:34:51.180 --> 00:34:51.190
whereas loaders are pretty easy to
 

00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:52.379
whereas loaders are pretty easy to
implement if you just do it from the

00:34:52.379 --> 00:34:52.389
implement if you just do it from the
 

00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:52.649
implement if you just do it from the
start

00:34:52.649 --> 00:34:52.659
start
 

00:34:52.659 --> 00:34:54.059
start
but then you know if your requirements

00:34:54.059 --> 00:34:54.069
but then you know if your requirements
 

00:34:54.069 --> 00:34:55.349
but then you know if your requirements
change on you then you kind of have that

00:34:55.349 --> 00:34:55.359
change on you then you kind of have that
 

00:34:55.359 --> 00:34:58.710
change on you then you kind of have that
flexibility to react to it but I guess

00:34:58.710 --> 00:34:58.720
flexibility to react to it but I guess
 

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:02.309
flexibility to react to it but I guess
you know your requirements better thanks

00:35:02.309 --> 00:35:02.319
you know your requirements better thanks
 

00:35:02.319 --> 00:35:02.700
you know your requirements better thanks
guys

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:02.710
guys
 

00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:05.460
guys
okay hey Canton how you getting on there

00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:05.470
okay hey Canton how you getting on there
 

00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:14.039
okay hey Canton how you getting on there

screwed everyone up yeah okay yeah that
 

00:35:24.099 --> 00:35:26.370
screwed everyone up yeah okay yeah that
thing yesterday um special reto about it

00:35:26.370 --> 00:35:26.380
thing yesterday um special reto about it
 

00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:29.279
thing yesterday um special reto about it
as well in he's you wanted to know it's

00:35:29.279 --> 00:35:29.289
as well in he's you wanted to know it's
 

00:35:29.289 --> 00:35:30.720
as well in he's you wanted to know it's
the same problem you'd report to him

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:30.730
the same problem you'd report to him
 

00:35:30.730 --> 00:35:31.049
the same problem you'd report to him
already

00:35:31.049 --> 00:35:31.059
already
 

00:35:31.059 --> 00:35:36.359
already
oh yeah and I got to the bottom of it

00:35:36.359 --> 00:35:36.369
oh yeah and I got to the bottom of it
 

00:35:36.369 --> 00:35:39.720
oh yeah and I got to the bottom of it
it's basically single shot used to give

00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:39.730
it's basically single shot used to give
 

00:35:39.730 --> 00:35:42.630
it's basically single shot used to give
you about four or five shots and now it

00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:42.640
you about four or five shots and now it
 

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:43.799
you about four or five shots and now it
gives you a single shot which is

00:35:43.799 --> 00:35:43.809
gives you a single shot which is
 

00:35:43.809 --> 00:35:44.910
gives you a single shot which is
probably what it should have done in the

00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:44.920
probably what it should have done in the
 

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:47.549
probably what it should have done in the
first place but it totally messed up

00:35:47.549 --> 00:35:47.559
first place but it totally messed up
 

00:35:47.559 --> 00:35:52.380
first place but it totally messed up
what I was doing with it so are you yeah

00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:52.390
what I was doing with it so are you yeah
 

00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:54.029
what I was doing with it so are you yeah
exactly because it really used to return

00:35:54.029 --> 00:35:54.039
exactly because it really used to return
 

00:35:54.039 --> 00:35:56.120
exactly because it really used to return
like about four progressively more

00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:56.130
like about four progressively more
 

00:35:56.130 --> 00:35:59.730
like about four progressively more
detailed versions so I just waited until

00:35:59.730 --> 00:35:59.740
detailed versions so I just waited until
 

00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:01.109
detailed versions so I just waited until
I didn't get one for ten seconds and

00:36:01.109 --> 00:36:01.119
I didn't get one for ten seconds and
 

00:36:01.119 --> 00:36:03.269
I didn't get one for ten seconds and
then use that but ignored the first one

00:36:03.269 --> 00:36:03.279
then use that but ignored the first one
 

00:36:03.279 --> 00:36:07.760
then use that but ignored the first one
cuz and now you only get the first one I

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:07.770
cuz and now you only get the first one I
 

00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:09.809
cuz and now you only get the first one I
don't think the first one actually had

00:36:09.809 --> 00:36:09.819
don't think the first one actually had
 

00:36:09.819 --> 00:36:15.269
don't think the first one actually had
the payload in it before little

00:36:15.269 --> 00:36:15.279
the payload in it before little
 

00:36:15.279 --> 00:36:21.079
the payload in it before little
buoys location what like Groupon yeah

00:36:21.079 --> 00:36:21.089
 

00:36:21.089 --> 00:36:24.450
yeah I know that's all right I've

00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:24.460
yeah I know that's all right I've
 

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:27.140
yeah I know that's all right I've
updated it and it's been pushed out so

00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:27.150
updated it and it's been pushed out so
 

00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:34.670
updated it and it's been pushed out so
hopefully hopefully people see it change

00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:34.680
 

00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:36.900
okay do we have any other questions from

00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:36.910
okay do we have any other questions from
 

00:36:36.910 --> 00:36:38.339
okay do we have any other questions from
the Hangout if not we'll head into the

00:36:38.339 --> 00:36:38.349
the Hangout if not we'll head into the
 

00:36:38.349 --> 00:36:43.460
the Hangout if not we'll head into the
moderator er I have a question hi there

00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:43.470
moderator er I have a question hi there
 

00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:45.960
moderator er I have a question hi there
hello can you hear me yeah we can only

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:45.970
hello can you hear me yeah we can only
 

00:36:45.970 --> 00:36:46.880
hello can you hear me yeah we can only
find a timer

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:46.890
find a timer
 

00:36:46.890 --> 00:36:49.440
find a timer
okay this is my first time on the

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:49.450
okay this is my first time on the
 

00:36:49.450 --> 00:36:56.460
okay this is my first time on the
handout and the question I have is that

00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:56.470
handout and the question I have is that
 

00:36:56.470 --> 00:36:59.370
handout and the question I have is that
I'm pretty new to android developments

00:36:59.370 --> 00:36:59.380
I'm pretty new to android developments
 

00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:01.710
I'm pretty new to android developments
and I noticed that I had to learn Java

00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:01.720
and I noticed that I had to learn Java
 

00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:03.269
and I noticed that I had to learn Java
first you know that's with develop

00:37:03.269 --> 00:37:03.279
first you know that's with develop
 

00:37:03.279 --> 00:37:05.020
first you know that's with develop
programs and

00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:05.030
programs and
 

00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:07.720
programs and
hundred applications yeah and I was one

00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:07.730
hundred applications yeah and I was one
 

00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:10.390
hundred applications yeah and I was one
and we said just so we can be good to go

00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:10.400
and we said just so we can be good to go
 

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:12.670
and we said just so we can be good to go
I'd stumbled on a scripting layer for

00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:12.680
I'd stumbled on a scripting layer for
 

00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:17.020
I'd stumbled on a scripting layer for
Android using Python and I have a very

00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:17.030
Android using Python and I have a very
 

00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:18.580
Android using Python and I have a very
good background with Python and I was

00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:18.590
good background with Python and I was
 

00:37:18.590 --> 00:37:21.450
good background with Python and I was
wondering wouldn't be what we call easy

00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:21.460
wondering wouldn't be what we call easy
 

00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:24.400
wondering wouldn't be what we call easy
Android developers can also look into

00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:24.410
Android developers can also look into
 

00:37:24.410 --> 00:37:26.770
Android developers can also look into
the area of integrating Python into

00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:26.780
the area of integrating Python into
 

00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:29.200
the area of integrating Python into
their SDK or having a development

00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:29.210
their SDK or having a development
 

00:37:29.210 --> 00:37:33.430
their SDK or having a development
platform for or Python or developing

00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:33.440
platform for or Python or developing
 

00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:35.830
platform for or Python or developing
apps that are the question I have yeah I

00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:35.840
apps that are the question I have yeah I
 

00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:37.990
apps that are the question I have yeah I
mean we've definitely have internal

00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:38.000
mean we've definitely have internal
 

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.250
mean we've definitely have internal
conversations about these things before

00:37:39.250 --> 00:37:39.260
conversations about these things before
 

00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:41.590
conversations about these things before
I guess one of the limitations is the

00:37:41.590 --> 00:37:41.600
I guess one of the limitations is the
 

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:43.810
I guess one of the limitations is the
size of the tools team we're focused

00:37:43.810 --> 00:37:43.820
size of the tools team we're focused
 

00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:45.760
size of the tools team we're focused
very much on progressing the platform

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:45.770
very much on progressing the platform
 

00:37:45.770 --> 00:37:47.470
very much on progressing the platform
progressing the API is progressing all

00:37:47.470 --> 00:37:47.480
progressing the API is progressing all
 

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:49.120
progressing the API is progressing all
that and if we were supporting two sets

00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:49.130
that and if we were supporting two sets
 

00:37:49.130 --> 00:37:50.620
that and if we were supporting two sets
of api's with two different languages it

00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:50.630
of api's with two different languages it
 

00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:51.940
of api's with two different languages it
would just slow everything down require

00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:51.950
would just slow everything down require
 

00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:54.820
would just slow everything down require
a lot more testing and we are very much

00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:54.830
a lot more testing and we are very much
 

00:37:54.830 --> 00:37:56.170
a lot more testing and we are very much
focused on the single language at the

00:37:56.170 --> 00:37:56.180
focused on the single language at the
 

00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:58.330
focused on the single language at the
moment because the issue using a

00:37:58.330 --> 00:37:58.340
moment because the issue using a
 

00:37:58.340 --> 00:38:00.970
moment because the issue using a
scripting language on top of Android is

00:38:00.970 --> 00:38:00.980
scripting language on top of Android is
 

00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:02.170
scripting language on top of Android is
you're not gonna get all the benefits of

00:38:02.170 --> 00:38:02.180
you're not gonna get all the benefits of
 

00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:03.940
you're not gonna get all the benefits of
the the responsive layout tools that we

00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:03.950
the the responsive layout tools that we
 

00:38:03.950 --> 00:38:06.310
the the responsive layout tools that we
have the the resources folder the values

00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:06.320
have the the resources folder the values
 

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:07.510
have the the resources folder the values
all the things that are built into the

00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:07.520
all the things that are built into the
 

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:09.190
all the things that are built into the
core platform to be to enable you to

00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:09.200
core platform to be to enable you to
 

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:11.170
core platform to be to enable you to
write applications that work seamlessly

00:38:11.170 --> 00:38:11.180
write applications that work seamlessly
 

00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:13.480
write applications that work seamlessly
across the device ranges that we have

00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:13.490
across the device ranges that we have
 

00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:15.880
across the device ranges that we have
yeah so to put that all across to

00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:15.890
yeah so to put that all across to
 

00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:17.590
yeah so to put that all across to
another language via a massive

00:38:17.590 --> 00:38:17.600
another language via a massive
 

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:21.640
another language via a massive
undertaking I think but certainly there

00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:21.650
undertaking I think but certainly there
 

00:38:21.650 --> 00:38:23.200
undertaking I think but certainly there
are people who where the platform's

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:23.210
are people who where the platform's
 

00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:25.060
are people who where the platform's
moving so fast as well right like you

00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:25.070
moving so fast as well right like you
 

00:38:25.070 --> 00:38:27.760
moving so fast as well right like you
know a six-month leash release schedule

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:27.770
know a six-month leash release schedule
 

00:38:27.770 --> 00:38:30.070
know a six-month leash release schedule
if not you know if you stop releases in

00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:30.080
if not you know if you stop releases in
 

00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:32.350
if not you know if you stop releases in
between like two one then you know it's

00:38:32.350 --> 00:38:32.360
between like two one then you know it's
 

00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:34.660
between like two one then you know it's
pretty hard to keep up with that let

00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:34.670
pretty hard to keep up with that let
 

00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:37.690
pretty hard to keep up with that let
alone yeah then I can totally see the

00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:37.700
alone yeah then I can totally see the
 

00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:39.520
alone yeah then I can totally see the
appeal of it and I don't know why a lot

00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:39.530
appeal of it and I don't know why a lot
 

00:38:39.530 --> 00:38:41.440
appeal of it and I don't know why a lot
of people are doing scripting layers on

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:41.450
of people are doing scripting layers on
 

00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:43.750
of people are doing scripting layers on
Android and things like the mono library

00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:43.760
Android and things like the mono library
 

00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:45.160
Android and things like the mono library
for.net developers

00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:45.170
for.net developers
 

00:38:45.170 --> 00:38:49.180
for.net developers
yeah they there's definitely people who

00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:49.190
yeah they there's definitely people who
 

00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:50.470
yeah they there's definitely people who
would like to code in other languages

00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:50.480
would like to code in other languages
 

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:52.440
would like to code in other languages
but certainly for me freelancing I guess

00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:52.450
but certainly for me freelancing I guess
 

00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:55.330
but certainly for me freelancing I guess
because today Michael seems to have a

00:38:55.330 --> 00:38:55.340
because today Michael seems to have a
 

00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:57.820
because today Michael seems to have a
lot of libraries too so handles so many

00:38:57.820 --> 00:38:57.830
lot of libraries too so handles so many
 

00:38:57.830 --> 00:39:00.460
lot of libraries too so handles so many
tasks and it would also be cool to have

00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:00.470
tasks and it would also be cool to have
 

00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:02.680
tasks and it would also be cool to have
its have the developers also concentrate

00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:02.690
its have the developers also concentrate
 

00:39:02.690 --> 00:39:07.090
its have the developers also concentrate
in that direction as well the Android

00:39:07.090 --> 00:39:07.100
in that direction as well the Android
 

00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:09.430
in that direction as well the Android
community also provides a vast array of

00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:09.440
community also provides a vast array of
 

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:10.810
community also provides a vast array of
libraries for doing almost anything you

00:39:10.810 --> 00:39:10.820
libraries for doing almost anything you
 

00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:12.520
libraries for doing almost anything you
want to do an Android as well people

00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:12.530
want to do an Android as well people
 

00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:14.590
want to do an Android as well people
seem almost entitled to not write code

00:39:14.590 --> 00:39:14.600
seem almost entitled to not write code
 

00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:16.600
seem almost entitled to not write code
on Android these days they can't find a

00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:16.610
on Android these days they can't find a
 

00:39:16.610 --> 00:39:17.920
on Android these days they can't find a
library to do it the head of it

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:17.930
library to do it the head of it
 

00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:20.170
library to do it the head of it
I had to write some code myself there's

00:39:20.170 --> 00:39:20.180
I had to write some code myself there's
 

00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:22.510
I had to write some code myself there's
so many Android specific libraries from

00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:22.520
so many Android specific libraries from
 

00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:24.490
so many Android specific libraries from
the community it's one of the most

00:39:24.490 --> 00:39:24.500
the community it's one of the most
 

00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:25.839
the community it's one of the most
excellent things about Android

00:39:25.839 --> 00:39:25.849
excellent things about Android
 

00:39:25.849 --> 00:39:29.260
excellent things about Android

one be con cons versus versus the
adapter that we can only change the

00:47:45.650 --> 00:47:45.660
adapter that we can only change the
 

00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:48.390
adapter that we can only change the
specific data that was changed right

00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:48.400
specific data that was changed right
 

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:49.890
specific data that was changed right
exactly yeah it will monitoring the

00:47:49.890 --> 00:47:49.900
exactly yeah it will monitoring the
 

00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:52.470
exactly yeah it will monitoring the
whole net and content URI all right so

00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:52.480
whole net and content URI all right so
 

00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:54.090
whole net and content URI all right so
if anything in that content URI changes

00:47:54.090 --> 00:47:54.100
if anything in that content URI changes
 

00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:57.990
if anything in that content URI changes
is gonna require it hoping so that's a

00:47:57.990 --> 00:47:58.000
is gonna require it hoping so that's a
 

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.720
is gonna require it hoping so that's a
big performance issue

00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:01.730
 

00:48:01.730 --> 00:48:09.670
okay just a very frame sure so what was

00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:09.680
okay just a very frame sure so what was
 

00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:11.290
okay just a very frame sure so what was
that we'll pull out all of the data

00:48:11.290 --> 00:48:11.300
that we'll pull out all of the data
 

00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:11.920
that we'll pull out all of the data
again

00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:11.930

yep no we query queries Oh women if
 

00:48:15.380 --> 00:48:16.390
yep no we query queries Oh women if
we're pulling out would just be

00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:16.400
we're pulling out would just be
 

00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:18.190

confirmed as well because when you

00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:23.270
confirmed as well because when you
 

00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:25.930
confirmed as well because when you

00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:33.940
don't make many guarantees about so it's
quite hard to guarantee that the new

also interested about what the scale

00:52:26.620 --> 00:52:26.630
also interested about what the scale
 

00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:28.030
also interested about what the scale
type might be on it as well because if

00:52:28.030 --> 00:52:28.040
type might be on it as well because if
 

00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:30.070

the drawables I'm guessing the dribble

00:52:30.070 --> 00:52:30.080
the drawables I'm guessing the dribble
 

00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:31.210
the drawables I'm guessing the dribble
is much bigger than these actually

00:52:31.210 --> 00:52:31.220
is much bigger than these actually
 

00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:33.220

00:52:33.230 --> 00:52:34.450
displaying it on screen in which case
you know that's why he's worried about

00:52:34.450 --> 00:52:34.460
you know that's why he's worried about
 

00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:36.670
you know that's why he's worried about
the MTA's and stuff because it has been

00:52:36.670 --> 00:52:36.680
the MTA's and stuff because it has been
 

00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:38.710
the MTA's and stuff because it has been
resized down or something can you set

00:52:38.710 --> 00:52:38.720
resized down or something can you set
 

00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:42.550
resized down or something can you set
that with a scale type I can you provide

00:52:42.550 --> 00:52:42.560
that with a scale type I can you provide
 

00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:44.140
that with a scale type I can you provide
your own matrix to scale it or can you

00:52:44.140 --> 00:52:44.150
your own matrix to scale it or can you
 

00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:45.910
your own matrix to scale it or can you
pre scale the bitmap before setting it

00:52:45.910 --> 00:52:45.920
pre scale the bitmap before setting it
 

00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:47.740
pre scale the bitmap before setting it
and so you don't have to set a scale

00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:47.750
and so you don't have to set a scale
 

00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:49.450
and so you don't have to set a scale
type this is what I'm thinking yes in

00:52:49.450 --> 00:52:49.460
type this is what I'm thinking yes in
 

00:52:49.460 --> 00:52:51.070
type this is what I'm thinking yes in
amounts to pre scale the bitmap yourself

00:52:51.070 --> 00:52:51.080
amounts to pre scale the bitmap yourself
 

00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:52.420
amounts to pre scale the bitmap yourself
you probably would have the the right

00:52:52.420 --> 00:52:52.430
you probably would have the the right
 

00:52:52.430 --> 00:52:54.340
you probably would have the the right
flags and map manager when you scale it

00:52:54.340 --> 00:52:54.350
flags and map manager when you scale it
 

00:52:54.350 --> 00:52:57.250
flags and map manager when you scale it
to do the anti-aliasing and then just

00:52:57.250 --> 00:52:57.260
to do the anti-aliasing and then just
 

00:52:57.260 --> 00:52:59.500
to do the anti-aliasing and then just
set the scale bitmap if you're leaving

00:52:59.500 --> 00:52:59.510
set the scale bitmap if you're leaving
 

00:52:59.510 --> 00:53:02.080
set the scale bitmap if you're leaving
UPS the image view to fit then you end

00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:02.090
UPS the image view to fit then you end

the best option well yeah it's just not

00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:06.290
the best option well yeah it's just not
 

00:53:06.290 --> 00:53:08.890
the best option well yeah it's just not
gonna do it yeah so that's something I'd

00:53:08.890 --> 00:53:08.900
gonna do it yeah so that's something I'd
 

00:53:08.900 --> 00:53:10.870
gonna do it yeah so that's something I'd
look into yes only try scaling the image

00:53:10.870 --> 00:53:10.880
look into yes only try scaling the image
 

00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:12.760
look into yes only try scaling the image
yourself before and they're saying you

00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:12.770
yourself before and they're saying you
 

00:53:12.770 --> 00:53:13.990

know the pre scaled image on the

00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:14.000
know the pre scaled image on the

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:48.200
are you sure sure sure sure sure sure
okay if you want that can later the

00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:48.210
okay if you want that can later the
 

00:55:48.210 --> 00:55:51.079
okay if you want that can later the
code somewhere yeah yeah it's possible

00:55:51.079 --> 00:55:51.089
code somewhere yeah yeah it's possible
 

00:55:51.089 --> 00:55:52.760
code somewhere yeah yeah it's possible
because there were some people who had

00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:56.730
upgraded to GCM they only had to support
 

00:55:56.730 --> 00:55:58.309

goes through the register the GC and

00:57:13.850 --> 00:57:13.860
goes through the register the GC and
 

00:57:13.860 --> 00:57:16.430
goes through the register the GC and
registration process which I'm not sure

00:57:16.430 --> 00:57:16.440
registration process which I'm not sure
 

00:57:16.440 --> 00:57:17.630
registration process which I'm not sure
that it should do that I need to check

00:57:17.630 --> 00:57:17.640
that it should do that I need to check
 

00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:20.450
that it should do that I need to check
and let's check into that and they're

00:57:20.450 --> 00:57:20.460
and let's check into that and they're
 

00:57:20.460 --> 00:57:22.010
and let's check into that and they're
off the time it will come back saying GC

00:57:22.010 --> 00:57:22.020
off the time it will come back saying GC

I'm not registered but it is registered
from the last time it run so it's

00:57:25.940 --> 00:57:25.950
from the last time it run so it's
 

00:57:25.950 --> 00:57:27.980
from the last time it run so it's
checked unknown issues you have no okay

00:57:27.980 --> 00:57:27.990
checked unknown issues you have no okay
 

00:57:27.990 --> 00:57:32.410
checked unknown issues you have no okay
no issues regarding GCM at the moment

00:57:32.410 --> 00:57:32.420
 

00:57:32.420 --> 00:57:34.610
so it sounds more likely to be something

00:57:34.610 --> 00:57:34.620
so it sounds more likely to be something
 

00:57:34.620 --> 00:57:37.760

wondering if do you think everyone is
still doing that today or do you think

00:58:23.990 --> 00:58:24.000
still doing that today or do you think
 

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.330
