00:00:12.817 --> 00:00:16.062
I'm a bit of a perfectionist.

00:00:16.086 --> 00:00:18.625
Now, how many times
have you heard that one?

00:00:19.683 --> 00:00:24.566
Over drinks, maybe, with friends,
or perhaps with family at Thanksgiving.

00:00:25.281 --> 00:00:27.820
It's everyone's favorite flaw,

00:00:27.844 --> 00:00:31.077
it's that now quite common response

00:00:31.101 --> 00:00:35.572
to the difficult, final question
at job interviews:

00:00:36.165 --> 00:00:37.625
"My biggest weakness?

00:00:38.864 --> 00:00:40.630
That's my perfectionism."

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:45.237
You see, for something
that supposedly holds us back,

00:00:45.261 --> 00:00:48.785
it's quite remarkable how many of us
are quite happy to hold our hands up

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.514
and say we're perfectionists.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.730
But there's an interesting
and serious point

00:00:55.754 --> 00:01:02.236
because our begrudging admiration
for perfection is so pervasive

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.339
that we never really stop to question
that concept in its own terms.

00:01:06.363 --> 00:01:10.133
What does it say about us and our society

00:01:10.157 --> 00:01:14.465
that there is a kind
of celebration in perfection?

00:01:14.489 --> 00:01:21.070
We tend to hold perfectionism up
as an insignia of worth.

00:01:21.704 --> 00:01:24.606
The emblem of the successful.

00:01:25.718 --> 00:01:27.972
Yet, in my time studying perfectionism,

00:01:27.996 --> 00:01:31.837
I've seen limited evidence
that perfectionists are more successful.

00:01:31.861 --> 00:01:33.044
Quite the contrary --

00:01:33.068 --> 00:01:36.188
they feel discontented and dissatisfied

00:01:36.212 --> 00:01:40.298
amid a lingering sense
that they're never quite perfect enough.

00:01:40.322 --> 00:01:42.529
We know from clinician case reports

00:01:42.553 --> 00:01:45.811
that perfectionism conceals
a host of psychological difficulties,

00:01:45.835 --> 00:01:49.965
including things like depression,
anxiety, anorexia, bulimia

00:01:49.989 --> 00:01:52.228
and even suicide ideation.

00:01:52.252 --> 00:01:56.036
And what's more worrying
is that over the last 25 years,

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.719
we have seen perfectionism rise
at an alarming rate.

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:01.610
And at the same time,

00:02:01.634 --> 00:02:05.185
we have seen more mental illness
among young people than ever before.

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:08.379
Rates of suicide in the US alone

00:02:08.403 --> 00:02:12.355
increased by 25 percent
across the last two decades.

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:15.537
And we're beginning to see similar trends
emerge across Canada,

00:02:15.561 --> 00:02:18.363
and in my home country,
the United Kingdom.

00:02:18.792 --> 00:02:21.625
Now, our research is suggesting

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:25.951
that perfectionism is rising
as society is changing.

00:02:25.975 --> 00:02:30.455
And a changed society reflects
a changed sense of personal identity

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:34.874
and, with it, differences in the way
in which young people interact

00:02:34.898 --> 00:02:36.962
with each other and the world around them.

00:02:36.986 --> 00:02:42.475
And there are some unique characteristics
about our preeminent, market-based society

00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:44.585
that include things
like unrestricted choice

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:46.136
and personal freedom,

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.831
and these are characteristics
that we feel are contributing

00:02:49.855 --> 00:02:52.950
to almost epidemic levels of this problem.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.251
So let me give you an example.

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.561
Young people today are more preoccupied
with the attainment of the perfect life

00:03:00.585 --> 00:03:01.736
and lifestyle.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.906
In terms of their image,
status and wealth.

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.695
Data from Pew show that young people

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:12.918
born in the US in the late 1980s

00:03:12.942 --> 00:03:17.617
are 20 percent more likely
to report being materially rich

00:03:17.641 --> 00:03:19.625
as among their most important life goals,

00:03:19.649 --> 00:03:22.767
relative to their parents
and their grandparents.

00:03:22.791 --> 00:03:25.856
Young people also borrow more heavily
than did older generations,

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.093
and they spend a much greater proportion
of their income on image goods

00:03:30.117 --> 00:03:31.855
and status possessions.

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:36.497
These possessions,
their lives and their lifestyles

00:03:36.521 --> 00:03:40.974
are now displayed in vivid detail
on the ubiquitous social media platforms

00:03:40.998 --> 00:03:44.650
of Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat.

00:03:44.982 --> 00:03:47.077
In this new visual culture,

00:03:47.101 --> 00:03:53.609
the appearance of perfection
is far more important than the reality.

00:03:54.396 --> 00:03:57.454
If one side of the modern landscape

00:03:57.478 --> 00:04:00.142
that we have so lavishly
furnished for young people

00:04:00.166 --> 00:04:02.444
is this idea that there's
a perfectible life

00:04:02.468 --> 00:04:04.609
and that there's a perfectible lifestyle,

00:04:04.633 --> 00:04:06.799
then the other is surely work.

00:04:06.823 --> 00:04:10.069
Nothing is out of reach
for those who want it badly enough.

00:04:10.093 --> 00:04:11.561
Or so we're told.

00:04:11.585 --> 00:04:15.119
This is the idea at the heart
of the American dream.

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:19.801
Opportunity, meritocracy,
the self-made person, hard work.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.037
The notion that hard work always pays off.

00:04:23.061 --> 00:04:27.228
And above all, the idea
that we're captains of our own destiny.

00:04:27.633 --> 00:04:30.967
These ideas, they connect
our wealth, our status

00:04:30.991 --> 00:04:34.125
and our image with our innate,
personal value.

00:04:35.157 --> 00:04:37.204
But it is, of course, complete fiction.

00:04:37.228 --> 00:04:40.762
Because even if there were
equality of opportunity,

00:04:40.786 --> 00:04:43.882
the idea that we are captains
of our own destiny

00:04:43.906 --> 00:04:46.219
disguises a much darker
reality for young people

00:04:46.243 --> 00:04:49.394
that they are subject to an almost
ongoing economic tribunal.

00:04:49.778 --> 00:04:52.072
Metrics, rankings, lead tables

00:04:52.096 --> 00:04:55.817
have emerged as the yardsticks
for which merit can be quantified

00:04:55.841 --> 00:05:00.824
and used to sort young people
into schools, classes and colleges.

00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:03.556
Education is the first arena

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.946
where measurement
is so publicly played out

00:05:06.354 --> 00:05:08.855
and where metrics are being used

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:11.885
as a tool to improve standards
and performance.

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.553
And it starts young.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.529
Young people in America's
big city high schools

00:05:17.553 --> 00:05:22.736
take some 112 mandatory standardized tests

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.602
between prekindergarten
and the end of 12th grade.

00:05:26.117 --> 00:05:28.823
No wonder young people report
a strong need to strive,

00:05:28.847 --> 00:05:31.327
perform and achieve
at the center of modern life.

00:05:31.351 --> 00:05:34.231
They've been conditioned
to define themselves

00:05:34.265 --> 00:05:41.367
in the strict and narrow terms
of grades, percentiles and lead tables.

00:05:42.103 --> 00:05:46.127
This is a society that preys
on their insecurities.

00:05:46.151 --> 00:05:48.276
Insecurities about
how they are performing

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.712
and how they are appearing
to other people.

00:05:50.736 --> 00:05:54.248
This is a society that amplifies
their imperfections.

00:05:54.553 --> 00:05:57.252
Every flaw, every unforeseen setback

00:05:57.276 --> 00:06:02.410
increases a need to perform
more perfectly next time, or else,

00:06:02.434 --> 00:06:04.878
bluntly, you're a failure.

00:06:05.188 --> 00:06:08.862
That feeling of being flawed and deficient
is especially pervasive --

00:06:08.886 --> 00:06:10.379
just talk to young people.

00:06:10.403 --> 00:06:12.649
"How should I look, how should I behave?"

00:06:12.673 --> 00:06:14.164
"I should look like that model,

00:06:14.188 --> 00:06:17.117
I should have as many followers
as that Instagram influencer,

00:06:17.141 --> 00:06:18.929
I must do better in school."

00:06:20.088 --> 00:06:24.866
In my role as mentor to many young people,

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:27.557
I see these lived effects
of perfectionism firsthand.

00:06:28.374 --> 00:06:31.517
And one student sticks out
in my mind very vividly.

00:06:32.427 --> 00:06:36.307
John, not his real name, was ambitious,

00:06:36.331 --> 00:06:37.649
hardworking and diligent

00:06:37.673 --> 00:06:40.296
and on the surface,
he was exceptionally high-achieving,

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.823
often getting first-class
grades for his work.

00:06:43.847 --> 00:06:47.323
Yet, no matter how well John achieved,

00:06:47.347 --> 00:06:50.601
he always seemed to recast
his successes as abject failures,

00:06:50.625 --> 00:06:51.799
and in meetings with me,

00:06:51.823 --> 00:06:55.125
he would talk openly about
how he'd let himself and others down.

00:06:55.149 --> 00:06:57.887
John's justification was quite simple:

00:06:57.911 --> 00:07:00.133
How could he be a success

00:07:00.157 --> 00:07:02.553
when he was trying so much harder
than other people

00:07:02.577 --> 00:07:04.696
just to attain the same outcomes?

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.335
See, John's perfectionism,
his unrelenting work ethic,

00:07:09.359 --> 00:07:12.990
was only serving to expose
what he saw as his inner weakness

00:07:13.014 --> 00:07:15.736
to himself and to others.

00:07:16.212 --> 00:07:19.610
Cases like John's speak
to the harmfulness of perfectionism

00:07:19.634 --> 00:07:21.934
as a way of being in the world.

00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.252
Contrary to popular belief,

00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:27.506
perfectionism is never about
perfecting things or perfecting tasks.

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:30.156
It's not about striving for excellence.

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:32.580
John's case highlights this vividly.

00:07:32.893 --> 00:07:36.693
At its root, perfectionism
is about perfecting the self.

00:07:37.505 --> 00:07:40.850
Or, more precisely,
perfecting an imperfect self.

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:45.628
And you can think about it
like a mountain of achievement

00:07:45.652 --> 00:07:48.485
that perfectionism leads us
to imagine ourselves scaling.

00:07:48.509 --> 00:07:51.413
And we think to ourselves,
"Once I've reached that summit,

00:07:51.437 --> 00:07:54.762
then people will see I'm not flawed,
and I'll be worth something."

00:07:55.687 --> 00:07:57.536
But what perfectionism doesn't tell us

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.489
is that soon after reaching that summit,

00:07:59.513 --> 00:08:03.711
we will be called down again to the fresh
lowlands of insecurity and shame,

00:08:03.735 --> 00:08:06.387
just to try and scale that peak again.

00:08:06.411 --> 00:08:08.855
This is the cycle of self-defeat.

00:08:08.879 --> 00:08:12.919
In the pursuit of unattainable perfection,
a perfectionist just cannot step off.

00:08:13.315 --> 00:08:15.411
And it's why it's so difficult to treat.

00:08:16.014 --> 00:08:18.332
Now, we've known for decades and decades

00:08:18.356 --> 00:08:21.522
that perfectionism contributes
to a host of psychological problems,

00:08:21.546 --> 00:08:24.228
but there was never
a good way to measure it.

00:08:24.252 --> 00:08:25.714
That was until the late 1980s

00:08:25.738 --> 00:08:28.881
when two Canadians,
Paul Hewitt and Gordon Flett,

00:08:28.905 --> 00:08:32.132
came along and developed
a self-report measure of perfectionism.

00:08:32.156 --> 00:08:35.006
So that's right, folks,
you can measure this,

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:40.283
and it essentially captures
three core elements of perfectionism.

00:08:40.307 --> 00:08:42.528
The first is self-oriented perfectionism,

00:08:42.552 --> 00:08:45.592
the irrational desire to be perfect:

00:08:45.616 --> 00:08:47.942
"I strive to be as perfect as I can be."

00:08:48.566 --> 00:08:51.037
The second is socially
prescribed perfectionism,

00:08:51.061 --> 00:08:55.125
the sense that the social environment
is excessively demanding:

00:08:55.149 --> 00:08:57.347
"I feel that others
are too demanding of me."

00:08:57.665 --> 00:08:59.982
And the third is
other-oriented perfectionism,

00:09:00.006 --> 00:09:02.855
the imposition of unrealistic
standards on other people:

00:09:02.879 --> 00:09:06.663
"If I ask somebody to do something,
I expect it to be done perfectly."

00:09:07.076 --> 00:09:09.886
Now, research shows that all
three elements of perfectionism

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:11.864
associate with compromised mental health,

00:09:11.888 --> 00:09:13.966
including things
like heightened depression,

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:15.966
heightened anxiety and suicide ideation.

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:18.829
But, by far, the most problematic
element of perfectionism

00:09:18.853 --> 00:09:20.662
is socially prescribed perfectionism.

00:09:20.686 --> 00:09:24.172
That sense that everyone
expects me to be perfect.

00:09:24.196 --> 00:09:25.633
This element of perfectionism

00:09:25.657 --> 00:09:28.228
has a large correlation
with serious mental illness.

00:09:28.252 --> 00:09:34.347
And with today's emphasis on perfection
at the forefront of my mind,

00:09:34.371 --> 00:09:37.934
I was curious to see whether these
elements of perfectionism were changing.

00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:41.429
To date, research in this area
is focused on immediate family relations,

00:09:41.453 --> 00:09:44.753
but we wanted to look at it
at a broader level.

00:09:44.777 --> 00:09:47.864
So we took all of the data
that had ever been collected

00:09:47.888 --> 00:09:52.284
in the 27 years since Paul and Gordon
developed that perfectionism measure,

00:09:52.308 --> 00:09:54.410
and we isolated the data
in college students.

00:09:54.911 --> 00:09:57.553
This turned out to be
more than 40,000 young people

00:09:57.577 --> 00:09:59.688
from American, Canadian
and British colleges,

00:09:59.712 --> 00:10:03.734
and with so much data available,
we looked to see if there was a trend.

00:10:04.331 --> 00:10:06.395
And in all, it took us
more than three years

00:10:06.419 --> 00:10:09.165
to collate all of this information,
crunch the numbers,

00:10:09.189 --> 00:10:10.397
and write our report.

00:10:10.421 --> 00:10:14.189
But it was worth it because our analysis
uncovered something alarming.

00:10:15.438 --> 00:10:18.816
All three elements of perfectionism
have increased over time.

00:10:19.803 --> 00:10:24.316
But socially prescribed perfectionism
saw the largest increase, and by far.

00:10:24.634 --> 00:10:25.919
In 1989,

00:10:25.943 --> 00:10:29.106
just nine percent of young people
report clinically relevant levels

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:30.901
of socially prescribed perfectionism.

00:10:30.925 --> 00:10:34.517
Those are levels that we might
typically see in clinical populations.

00:10:35.069 --> 00:10:39.800
By 2017, that figure
had doubled to 18 percent.

00:10:40.411 --> 00:10:44.179
And by 2050, projections
based on the models that we tested

00:10:44.203 --> 00:10:46.679
indicate that almost one
in three young people

00:10:46.703 --> 00:10:50.973
will report clinically relevant levels
of socially prescribed perfectionism.

00:10:51.282 --> 00:10:53.811
Remember, this is the element
of perfectionism

00:10:53.835 --> 00:10:56.720
that has the largest correlation
with serious mental illness,

00:10:56.744 --> 00:10:58.276
and that's for good reason.

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:01.625
Socially prescribed perfectionists
feel a unrelenting need

00:11:01.649 --> 00:11:04.919
to meet the expectations of other people.

00:11:04.943 --> 00:11:08.585
And even if they do meet
yesterday's expectation of perfection,

00:11:08.609 --> 00:11:12.034
they then raise the bar on themselves
to an even higher degree

00:11:12.058 --> 00:11:15.781
because these folks believe
that the better they do,

00:11:15.805 --> 00:11:18.202
the better that they're expected to do.

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:24.035
This breeds a profound sense
of helplessness and, worse, hopelessness.

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:26.354
But is there hope?

00:11:26.378 --> 00:11:27.791
Of course there's hope.

00:11:27.815 --> 00:11:30.966
Perfectionists can and should
hold on to certain things --

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:34.648
they are typically bright, ambitious,
conscientious and hardworking.

00:11:35.212 --> 00:11:37.767
And yes, treatment is complex.

00:11:38.228 --> 00:11:41.069
But a little bit of self-compassion,

00:11:41.093 --> 00:11:43.936
going easy on ourselves
when things don't go well,

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:47.040
can turn those qualities
into greater personal peace and success.

00:11:47.064 --> 00:11:49.700
And then there's what
we can do as caregivers.

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:53.355
Perfectionism develops
in our formative years,

00:11:53.379 --> 00:11:55.633
and so young people are more vulnerable.

00:11:56.292 --> 00:11:57.848
Parents can help their children

00:11:57.872 --> 00:12:01.757
by supporting them unconditionally
when they've tried but failed.

00:12:02.196 --> 00:12:04.657
And Mom and Dad can resist
their understandable urge

00:12:04.681 --> 00:12:09.299
in today's highly competitive society
to helicopter-parent,

00:12:09.323 --> 00:12:11.983
as a lot of anxiety is communicated

00:12:12.007 --> 00:12:15.534
when parents take on their kids'
successes and failures as their own.

00:12:16.379 --> 00:12:19.923
But ultimately, our research
raises important questions

00:12:19.947 --> 00:12:21.880
about how we are structuring society

00:12:22.525 --> 00:12:26.252
and whether our society's heavy emphasis
on competition, evaluation and testing

00:12:26.256 --> 00:12:28.160
is benefiting young people.

00:12:28.184 --> 00:12:31.169
It's become commonplace
for public figures to say

00:12:31.193 --> 00:12:34.248
that young people just need
a little bit more resilience

00:12:34.272 --> 00:12:37.872
in the face of these new
and unprecedented pressures.

00:12:38.534 --> 00:12:42.666
But I believe that is us
washing our hands of the core issue

00:12:43.236 --> 00:12:45.601
because we have a shared responsibility

00:12:45.625 --> 00:12:50.354
to create a society and a culture
in which young people need less perfection

00:12:51.403 --> 00:12:52.669
in the first place.

00:12:53.053 --> 00:12:54.403
Let's not kid ourselves.

00:12:54.427 --> 00:12:56.926
Creating that kind of world
is an enormous challenge,

00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:58.712
and for a generation of young people

00:12:58.736 --> 00:13:00.767
that live their lives
in the 24/7 spotlight

00:13:00.791 --> 00:13:02.984
of metrics, lead tables and social media,

00:13:03.008 --> 00:13:05.521
perfectionism is inevitable,

00:13:05.545 --> 00:13:07.490
so long as they lack any purpose in life

00:13:07.514 --> 00:13:09.228
greater than how they are appearing

00:13:09.252 --> 00:13:11.363
or how they are performing
to other people.

00:13:11.387 --> 00:13:12.926
What can they do about it?

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:15.553
Every time they are knocked down
from that mountaintop,

00:13:15.577 --> 00:13:19.061
they see no other option
but to try scaling that peak again.

00:13:19.085 --> 00:13:20.815
The ancient Greeks knew

00:13:20.839 --> 00:13:24.303
that this endless struggle
up and down the same mountain

00:13:24.327 --> 00:13:25.938
is not the road to happiness.

00:13:26.244 --> 00:13:28.768
Their image of hell
was a man called Sisyphus,

00:13:28.792 --> 00:13:32.442
doomed for eternity to keep rolling
the same boulder up a hill,

00:13:32.466 --> 00:13:35.797
only to see it roll back down
and have to start again.

00:13:36.419 --> 00:13:38.292
So long as we teach young people

00:13:38.316 --> 00:13:41.713
that there is nothing more real
or meaningful in their lives

00:13:41.737 --> 00:13:43.672
than this hopeless quest for perfection,

00:13:43.696 --> 00:13:45.911
then we are going to condemn
future generations

00:13:45.935 --> 00:13:49.176
to that same futility and despair.

00:13:49.728 --> 00:13:51.450
And so we're left with a question.

00:13:52.437 --> 00:13:53.945
When are we going to appreciate

00:13:53.969 --> 00:13:57.556
that there is something
fundamentally inhuman

00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:59.380
about limitless perfection?

00:14:00.064 --> 00:14:01.436
No one is flawless.

00:14:01.879 --> 00:14:06.839
If we want to help our young people
escape the trap of perfectionism,

00:14:06.863 --> 00:14:10.070
then we will teach them
that in a chaotic world,

00:14:10.094 --> 00:14:12.828
life will often defeat us, but that's OK.

00:14:13.848 --> 00:14:15.448
Failure is not weakness.

00:14:16.317 --> 00:14:19.626
If we want to help our young people
outgrow this self-defeating snare

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:21.224
of impossible perfection,

00:14:21.248 --> 00:14:25.728
then we will raise them in a society
that has outgrown that very same delusion.

00:14:26.717 --> 00:14:28.177
But most of all,

00:14:28.201 --> 00:14:32.101
if we want our young people
to enjoy mental, emotional

00:14:32.125 --> 00:14:33.363
and psychological health,

00:14:33.387 --> 00:14:37.609
then we will invite them
to celebrate the joys

00:14:37.633 --> 00:14:41.495
and the beauties of imperfection

00:14:41.519 --> 00:14:47.649
as a normal and natural part
of everyday living and loving.

00:14:48.408 --> 00:14:49.742
Thank you very much.

00:14:49.766 --> 00:14:53.753
(Applause)
