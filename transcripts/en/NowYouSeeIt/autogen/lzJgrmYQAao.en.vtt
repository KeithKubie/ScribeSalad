00:00:02.872 --> 00:00:04.779
 In the world... 

00:00:05.744 --> 00:00:08.836
 In the world. The world. The world. 

00:00:09.914 --> 00:00:11.887
 In the world... 

00:00:12.511 --> 00:00:15.348
 Turn off your phone. Somehow it binds us. 

00:00:19.931 --> 00:00:22.374
 The trailer has four basic elements. 

00:00:22.414 --> 00:00:25.198
 Storyline, characters, conflict and cliffhanger. 

00:00:25.238 --> 00:00:29.392
 Each trailer is actually a short story that has footage from one movie. 

00:00:29.432 --> 00:00:33.060
 The only difference between a trailer and a short story is a cliffhanger. 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.610
 The aim of the trailer is to get people to the movies. 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.442
 Cliffhanger is what's missing in the trailer. 

00:00:38.482 --> 00:00:42.725
 The part you can enjoy by buying a ticket and watching the movie. 

00:00:42.765 --> 00:00:47.189
 But how to make a trailer so good that the movie itself cannot be a flop? 

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:49.531
 Wait. Safety first. 

00:00:49.571 --> 00:00:52.400
 Let's look at the history of the trailer structure 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.128
 and why even today there are greasy trailers. 

00:00:55.168 --> 00:00:59.408
 From the 1950s on, they had narrator trailers who told us four basic elements. 

00:00:59.448 --> 00:01:04.252
 He described the characters, the conflict, the storyline and why it is worth seeing the film. 

00:01:04.292 --> 00:01:08.195
 The story of little Tim and others in this unforgettable story ... 

00:01:08.235 --> 00:01:10.810
 Clips from the movie only complement the narrative. 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.046
 For most of the film history, the trailer was just a movie praising. 

00:01:15.086 --> 00:01:20.401
 Describe the characters, the conflict, why we should go about it and show some shots. 

00:01:20.441 --> 00:01:23.339
 And maybe throw funny music in a comedy case 

00:01:23.379 --> 00:01:25.645
 or something epic in the case of drama. 

00:01:25.685 --> 00:01:28.187
 Some trailers of this time were great. 

00:01:28.227 --> 00:01:32.038
 Hitchcock spoke on Psycha while he was walking around Bates's motel. 

00:01:32.078 --> 00:01:37.430
 The most terrifying events took place in this house. 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.988
 How trailers have been shortened to fit into a pause 

00:01:41.028 --> 00:01:44.846
 all started to look the same. Imagine the trailer "In the world ..." 

00:01:44.886 --> 00:01:48.794
 The narrator tells us the characters, the storyline, the conflict and the cliffhanger. 

00:01:48.834 --> 00:01:52.218
 New York cop John McClane came to his wife. 

00:01:52.258 --> 00:01:53.532
 You missed me. 

00:01:53.572 --> 00:01:57.058
 It's not just for action movies, comedies work similarly. 

00:01:57.098 --> 00:01:59.663
 Tell us everything and throw some jokes. 

00:01:59.703 --> 00:02:03.761
 Her name is Samatha Baker and she celebrates her 16th birthday today. 

00:02:03.801 --> 00:02:07.088
 But then this format began to be predictable and boring. 

00:02:07.128 --> 00:02:11.086
 Trailer type "In the world ..." is parodied more than it is used. 

00:02:11.126 --> 00:02:14.332
 In a world where laughter was king ... 

00:02:14.891 --> 00:02:16.896
 No "In the World", Jack. 

00:02:16.936 --> 00:02:19.281
 Beware of excessive generalization 

00:02:19.321 --> 00:02:21.734
 most of the films went by this formula, 

00:02:21.774 --> 00:02:24.744
 but there were always trailers that stood out. 

00:02:24.784 --> 00:02:28.547
 - We need to talk? - What? - Harry was here. - I was at Sally. 

00:02:28.587 --> 00:02:31.582
 - I was upset. - The word has spoken. 

00:02:31.622 --> 00:02:35.841
 - Then we kissed. - And to shorten it. - We did it. - They did it! 

00:02:35.881 --> 00:02:40.448
 Finally, even ordinary trailers started to be more creative and especially effective. 

00:02:40.488 --> 00:02:43.529
 A short trailer story can take about two minutes. 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:46.313
 If you can say more in less time, cool! 

00:02:46.353 --> 00:02:50.019
 First, get rid of the narrator and engage the characters in the movie. 

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:51.831
 This change makes sense. 

00:02:51.871 --> 00:02:56.494
 If we use the characters' voice, we can imagine conflict, plot and characters at the same time. 

00:02:56.534 --> 00:02:59.804
 Using science I'll put Mars on my ass. 

00:02:59.844 --> 00:03:02.854
 Characters do not need to describe the cliffhanger, show it. 

00:03:02.894 --> 00:03:05.682
 We want lightsabers if we go to Star Wars. 

00:03:05.722 --> 00:03:08.132
 How to make a trailer? Challenge us. 

00:03:08.172 --> 00:03:11.195
 End the trailer just before the impact of the lightsaber. 

00:03:11.235 --> 00:03:14.822
 Trailer broadcasts a message. If you buy a ticket, you'll see this. 

00:03:16.194 --> 00:03:17.949
 Then there is a trailer construction. 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.178
 Start with something familiar, normal, and then break it. 

00:03:21.218 --> 00:03:24.429
 - Does it live on African plains? - No. 

00:03:26.383 --> 00:03:30.806
 Accelerate, increase volume, and then add climax and solution. 

00:03:30.846 --> 00:03:35.139
 Many older trailers didn't do this, but today it's basically a norm. 

00:03:40.422 --> 00:03:43.901
 But there is a buried dog. These techniques are so common 

00:03:43.941 --> 00:03:46.142
 that makes the trailer stand out. 

00:03:46.182 --> 00:03:49.416
 We are familiar with vague dialogues, exaggerated music. 

00:03:49.456 --> 00:03:52.742
 For example, the last sentence of a trailer to be epic, 

00:03:52.782 --> 00:03:55.417
 but it is so vague that it almost makes no sense. 

00:03:55.457 --> 00:03:59.312
 When I saw you, I believed it was a sign 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.833
 that something new may come to this world. 

00:04:03.873 --> 00:04:08.200
 One way to fight this monotony is to make unique trailers, 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.729
 where the main elements reveal the order of shots 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.796
 instead of telling us the conflict and storyline. 

00:04:13.836 --> 00:04:18.173
 With the right shots in the right order, we are able to see the plot and the conflict. 

00:04:18.213 --> 00:04:21.498
 In the American sniper trailer Chris Kyle targets a child 

00:04:21.538 --> 00:04:23.782
 she might have to shoot. 

00:04:23.822 --> 00:04:26.892
 And his inner conflict? He doesn't describe any voice 

00:04:26.932 --> 00:04:28.915
 but the order of shots. 

00:04:33.814 --> 00:04:36.715
 And the cliffhanger is if he squeezes the trigger. 

00:04:40.905 --> 00:04:44.489
 Maybe show us the scene between the two main characters 

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:48.526
 and alternate scenes as they talk, and those where they are in their costumes. 

00:04:48.566 --> 00:04:52.261
 I have had a bad experience with the clown costume freaks. 

00:04:52.301 --> 00:04:54.927
 Or show one whole scene from the movie. 

00:04:54.967 --> 00:04:58.968
 Not a shot after the shot and no crazy background music 

00:04:59.008 --> 00:05:02.315
 just a quality scene. You get a quality trailer. 

00:05:02.355 --> 00:05:05.284
 That's why the Fast and Furious 7 trailer was successful. 

00:05:05.324 --> 00:05:08.071
 Movie trailers are like car ads. 

00:05:08.111 --> 00:05:10.583
 Most ads are basically the same. 

00:05:10.623 --> 00:05:14.513
 Show us the car that drives around while the narrator picks up the car. 

00:05:14.553 --> 00:05:17.401
 Stop the car, say its name and show the logo. 

00:05:17.441 --> 00:05:21.182
 This type of advertising sells cars because it is still in use. 

00:05:21.222 --> 00:05:25.299
 But he's boring. Maybe it's cheaper and easy to write, but we all know it. 

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:28.386
 Unique, funny, different viral ads 

00:05:28.426 --> 00:05:33.126
 they are the best because there is hype around them. 

00:05:35.648 --> 00:05:40.840
 Perhaps most of the trailers will continue to follow one formula. 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.345
 But the ones that stand out, the unique ones you want to share 

00:05:44.385 --> 00:05:47.672
 and you want to talk to friends, it's worth it. 

00:05:51.603 --> 00:05:59.668
