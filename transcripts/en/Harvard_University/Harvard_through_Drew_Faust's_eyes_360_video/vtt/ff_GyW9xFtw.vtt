00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.910
The art museums were closed
for six years of my presidency

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.910
for a major
restoration that would

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.180
make them an appropriate
place in which to locate art.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:18.280
They didn't have appropriate air
handling and climate control,

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.970
and a number of other
dimensions of the building

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.430
required really
careful attention.

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.040
But the Calderwood
Courtyard was there

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.740
as a kind of center
of the building

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.530
even before the renovation.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.370
It was carefully
preserved through what

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.010
was a gut overhaul
of the building,

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.190
and now restored in
a newly glorious form

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.500
with Renzo Piano's lantern
above it, the opening to the sky

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.450
that he installed on
the top of the building.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.510
So light streams down
into the courtyard,

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.690
and it is your entryway
into the museum.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.840
It's a place where you
can go and sit at a table

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.270
and have a cup of coffee
from the coffee shop

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.690
that has opened in the
newly renovated museum.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.379
It's a place you can linger
in between adventures

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.740
into various galleries
in the museum.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.890
But it's also become a kind
of public square for Harvard

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.550
in a way, as we have
many events there.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.090
The dinner after the awarding
of the Du Bois medals each fall

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.980
takes place there.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.940
I remember greeting a group
of middle school students

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.950
who had come from a distressed
area of New York City

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.080
to be introduced to Harvard
and introduced to what college

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.230
might be, and I had the
privilege of welcoming them

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.810
as they stood in that hallway.

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.390
And it's a place where
many events and gatherings

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.060
take place.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.650
But it's also an entry into
the museum and an entry

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.160
into the restoration
of art to the center

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.210
of our lives with the newly
renovated Harvard University

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.180
Art Museums Building.
