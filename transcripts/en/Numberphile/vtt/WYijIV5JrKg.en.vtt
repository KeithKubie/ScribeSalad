00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.360
So we are going to talk about what? The opposite of infinity?

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:08.100
What is the opposite of infinity if it's not minus infinity

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.760
then it is something that is the smallest thing ever

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.060
What is the smallest thing that you could  have and not quite zero?

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.340
The closest thing to zero

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.540
it's called an infinitesimal. is it even a thing?

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.380
Because there is something about that, that makes you feel a bit uncomfortable

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.880
It's been an idea that's been controversial for a long time, I mean thousands of years.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.260
Some people like it. Some people hate it.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.020
So what an infinitesimal would be?

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.980
A smallest number possible close to zero as possible

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.640
so it would be something that's bigger than zero

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:57.680
but is smaller than all other numbers let's say 'r' for real number. It is smaller than everything else. That is slightly uncomfortable because of this:

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.120
if you have two numbers,

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.180
if we have 'a' less that 'b'

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.400
there is always a number that I can fit in between

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.560
let's call it 'c', there is always something I can fit in between

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.720
and I can prove that because

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.900
'c' could be a+b divided by two

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.400
and that's proven.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.480
There is always something that you can slip in

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.480
between two numbers, no matter how close you think they are.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.480
- Can't we slip in something else?

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.480
So the idea of

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.480
having the next number

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.480
to zero makes intuitive sense

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.080
but mathematically

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.080
it's alarm bells ring.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.080
So this has always been a problem.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.080
But people use them to solve problems like this:

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.080
so let's say I have a circle

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.080
and I want to know the area

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.080
so this is one way you could do it.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.220
I can take my circle

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.220
and I could split it up into triangles

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.300
These are meant to be very small, thin triangles.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.720
These are wedges at the moment

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.720
but that's the problem.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.720
We're going to pretend they are triangles.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.480
Now they are wedges, if I pretend it's a triangles that means that it has a straight

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.280
base. But the thinner it is,

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.440
then the closer it would be to a triangle.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.620
So, you kind of say, "Okay, well let's pretend they're really really slim."

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.740
like the base is an infinitesimal.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.900
really slim, as slim as possible.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.900
And then what you do, you take this circle of triangles

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.620
and you kind of unwrap it like a hand fan

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.620
and you know, when you take a hand fan, shooo, like that.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.620
So that's what I'll do with this circle.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.260
That's my first triangle down here.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:36.820
So that's my centre.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.820
I take my first triangle

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.020
there it is, down here at the bottom.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.360
Take the second triangle

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.360
still connected to the centre

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.360
I've kind of stretched it though

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.540
so it looks like that.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.760
And I take the next triangle and it's a bit stretched again

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.060
and it looks like that

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.060
And I take the next triangle

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.480
All right, so I take all my triangles

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.060
I stretch them out

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.120
They're all connected to the centre like
-they were before

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.040
So they get really stretched out,  really thin.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.040
So they turn into this, right.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.900
It's actually turned it into a triangle.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.580
Can you see that? Can you see that triangle I've done?

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.400
My drawing is bad.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.900
You see that's a triangle.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.540
Now each of these triangles here, these slim triangles,

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.680
have the same area as they did to begin with.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.840
They've been stretched.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.840
The perimeter is different but they have the same area

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.840
because what is the area of a triangle?

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.060
It's a half the base times the height

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.340
Where they've been stretched, they have the same height

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.060
up to here. They got the same base.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.100
So the area's the same.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.100
But the big triangle I've made

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.100
it has height altogether

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.440
the radius of the circle 'r'

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.600
And the length of its base

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.100
is the circumference of the circle.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.680
So what is the area of this triangle?

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.160
It is a half

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.060
at the base is the circumference,

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.100
the height is the radius.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.580
That's the area of the triangle.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.580
The circumference? Two pi r. Right?

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:08.100
So it's a half times "two pi r" - the circumference, times r.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.100
And you get pi r squared.

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.180
And that is the area of the circle.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.820
You get the right formula

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.000
for the area of the circle.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.040
And so you did it by splitting it up into thin bits

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.040
and kind of adding them together with this clever idea.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.700
The guy who came up with that idea was Kepler.

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.440
Do you know Kepler? The guy who worked out the elliptical orbits of planets.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.440
So he was interested in working out the areas of an ellipse.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.560
There is something that should make you feel uncomfortable though

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.780
because there's always that small error, isn't there?

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.280
I mean I was saying that these triangles were approximating the wedge.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.540
There was always the - 
- and this is what the problem people have had with infinitesimals.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.200
There's always, - shouldn't - not quite - yeah what happened to all those curved bits?

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.200
So what they did - what the mathematicians were doing

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.580
when they were using it, is they were ignoring them.

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.940
So these mathematicians who were using infinitesimals were saying,

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.480
"Well it's really close to zero. We'll ignore it."

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.140
And then there were other mathematicians saying, "Well hang on!"

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.900
"You can't just ignore it. It might be close but it's not the same."

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.900
"And they can't be ignored."

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.540
And this is the problem people had.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.780
But yet, it seems to have worked.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.500
I'll show you a different idea that we used to do.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.500
Right, I'm just throwing my money around.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.680
Because I'm so rich I can throw my pennies around.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:22.060
Yes, the idea is that I've got my stacks of pennies here, and they're meant to be two cylinders, right.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:27.880
but if I took this one and started to mess it up a bit so it wasn't a cylinder

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.280
and to do something like that.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.280
Okay, so that's not a cylinder any more.

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.140
And the idea was, what mathematicians said was,

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:39.440
"If you took it, if you compared them slice by slice,

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.100
then each slice has the same cross sectional area."

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.400
like the area of a penny here.

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.580
So you can say that this

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.080
has the same volume as a cylinder. It's not a cylinder

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.080
but because you can compare it

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.080
slice by slice, instant by instant,

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.420
they have the same volume.

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:03.780
But those slices don't have depth, they don't have volume themselves.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:08.020
So you are comparing cross sectional area to cross sectional area.

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.040
So it's kind of like adding up all these cross sectional areas

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:16.980
but they don't have depth. You're adding up all these zero -

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.140
- these things with zero depth.

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:22.560
So how can you add them all up and get a volume?

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:26.420
But that's something they would do. You can compare two shapes like that.

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:30.880
And if each instant has the same area

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.880
we can say they have the same volume.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.900
So it was this idea going around as well.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.420
And infinitesimals were really important

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:42.500
when Newton and Leibniz started to use them

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.260
when they discovered or invented calculus,

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.500
which is a massive subject in maths; really important.

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:53.000
So in the seventeenth century they discovered calculus.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.940
This was trying to work out the area under a curve.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.460
Right. So let's try to work out the area under a curve.

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:04.840
So what you could do, is you could take this curve, if you want to find the area

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.840
underneath it here.

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:11.260
So you could split this up into thin strips.

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:17.260
And you were saying that each of these strips were like a rectangle.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:21.080
If you turned that into a rectangle you do get a little bit of error

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:25.580
but the thinner the rectangles the smaller the error.

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:30.820
So you can add up all these rectangles and find areas under curves, which is something mathematicians do.

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:33.820
So what Newton and Leibniz were doing - I might use a different colour

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:39.160
So chop it up, and let's say you have a little more here, let's make it a different colour.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:43.040
So the base of this rectangle is

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:46.320
something small. Infinitesimal perhaps.

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:49.940
And I'll call that delta.

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:52.980
That's actually a traditional notation.

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:54.220
So let's do that.

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:59.540
And what you're saying is if this curve - we call this curves things like f of x.

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:06.420
So what I'm saying is if this here is x, then this is going to be x + delta, x plus a little bit.

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:09.540
And the width of the base is delta.

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:13.800
If you work out this area, all the way up to x + delta.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:18.380
Let's take the area of all the way up to x + delta

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:23.460
and I subtract all this green bit here that's less than x.

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:27.680
So subtract the area, that is here, below x.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:30.920
That is equal to the area of this strip.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.920
So I've subtracted all the other strips.

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:35.940
And what is the area of that strip?

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:39.240
It is f(x), that's the height of the rectangle

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:42.160
multiplied by

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:44.340
this little base.

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:46.340
Or to put it another way

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:49.620
you could say the function is

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:56.620
[Area at] x+delta minus the area at x divided by delta.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:01.780
So what we've noticed is that the function was rate of change of area.

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:05.760
It might sound a bit abstract.

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:09.040
But this is the big discovery that Newton and Leibniz made.

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:14.640
That was actually hugely important because that means you could work out area by working out rate of change.

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.900
And rate of change was something that they could do.

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:20.500
And Newton and Leibniz were both working on this at the same time.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:23.940
And they both knew of each other's works, kind of,

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.800
but Leibniz published first.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:32.780
And then Newton published three years later his Principia Mathematica.

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:38.740
And there was this big debate about who came up with it first.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:45.960
And it got really nasty. Newton really wanted to protect his discovery.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:51.620
And Leibniz was almost - he couldn't be bothered to argue any more.

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:56.720
And in the end they set up this committee to work out who discovered calculus first.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:01.020
And it was all Newton's friends, and Newton himself wrote the report.

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:05.020
And do you know what? They discovered that Newton came up with it first.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.560
And then Leibniz then died

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:11.660
with his discovery, I guess, taken away from him

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:15.180
the honour of the discovery taken away from him.

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:17.180
And historians have looked at their notes

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:22.500
and decided that they came up with it completely independent of each other.

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.500
So now they both get credit.

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.920
But this uses infinitesimals.

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.220
It's the same problem.

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:31.220
And Newton knew this as well.

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:33.220
There's always this little bit of error.

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:35.220
It doesn't quite work.

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:41.580
And in the end, about two hundred years later they started to tidy this up, and they got rid of the infinitesimals

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:45.200
They realized you don't need to use the infinitesimals.

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:48.280
They had this new idea called limits

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:53.220
where these could get thinner and thinner and thinner and they would approach zero.

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:57.680
And this was called a limit, and this was mathematically rigorous and consistent.

00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:03.060
And it meant you didn't have to use infinitesimals to work out these areas

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.620
and they could be thrown out of the theory.

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:13.120
And not needed any more. And there are no infinitesimals in the real numbers.

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:15.560
They were gone

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.380
and then they made a comeback.

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:19.580
It's the "can't keep a good idea down."

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:25.980
It made another comeback in the 20th century. And it took til the 20th century, for it to made another big comeback

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:32.560
In the 1960s, a guy worked out a system where you could include the infinitesimals.

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:36.840
You could have a mathematically rigorous and consistent system.

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:40.120
You can solve problems using this system.

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:43.580
The guy was called Abraham Robinson.

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:49.020
It was in the 1960s. He could only do this in the 20th century

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:54.120
because it required mathematics that had been done in the twentieth century.

00:11:54.120 --> 00:12:00.600
They took the real numbers and then they added in infinitesimals into what was already there.

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:05.000
So infinitesimals don't exist in the real numbers but they added them in.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.340
So they said, "an infinitesimal is something that satisfies this. Right."

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:14.780
It is something that is less than all the other real numbers and bigger than zero.

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:18.080
So they added this idea, so it's an addition.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:19.740
It's called the hyperreals.

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:23.480
So you got these infinitesimals - let's call them 'e'

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:25.480
this is an infinitesimal

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:28.420
and you also have infinites in this system.

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:34.680
So you can have one over an infinitesimal is an infinite and that's allowed, that's included.

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:38.540
If you have two numbers that are infinitely close together,

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:43.820
if you said x and y are close together, that means that x minus y

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:46.120
is an infinitesimal.

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:50.500
So there is an idea of being infinitesimally close in this system.

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:54.000
In the real numbers zero is the only infinitesimal.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
In the real numbers we know

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.440
we would never do this, would we?

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:02.060
One divided by zero is not infinity.

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:03.340
We would never do that.

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:05.340
And that is still true in the hyperreals.

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:09.320
Everything that is true in the reals is still true in the hyperreals.

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:12.640
So that is not true in the real numbers

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:16.400
and it's not true in the hyperreals either.

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:20.260
So something like this: x plus y equals y plus x

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.260
that's true in the real numbers and it's true in the hyperreals.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:28.180
If you have x squared is greater than x,

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:33.080
x has to be bigger than one, that's true in the real numbers and it's true in the hyperreal numbers.

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:37.280
We know that 2x is not equal to x

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:42.660
that's true in the real numbers and it's true in the hyperreal numbers which means

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:45.380
if you had an infinitesimal

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:50.140
an infinitesimal is not the same as two times the infinitesimal,

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:52.140
and it's not the same as three times,

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:55.640
or four times, or n times.

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:59.000
These are all different. They'll all infinitesimals but they're all different.

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:02.620
So these things are not the same.

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:04.620
So there's lots of infinitesimals.

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:07.800
There's not just one infinitesimal there are lots.

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:11.960
There's this nice little quote, it's this guy Abraham Robinson

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:14.640
wanted to get into the mind of Leibniz

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:16.780
that's the quote that I've read.

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:18.780
He wants to get into his thinking.

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:23.180
And the thinking of infinitesimals and can we make this work and can we use it.

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:28.860
Now this system, finally, is consistent, it is rigorous.

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:31.180
It can be used properly.

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:35.740
It can be used to solve problems. It's called non-standard analysis.

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:44.540
People fans of this systems say it's more intuitive and they say it can solve problems with shorter proofs.

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:48.560
It has finally made another comeback.

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:55.220
Because what about now, before we divided by 2 if k was even

00:14:55.740 --> 00:15:04.800
But in the real numbers, all the non-zero elements, and k is certainly not zero, all the non-zero elments you can take their reciprocals, you can divide by them.
