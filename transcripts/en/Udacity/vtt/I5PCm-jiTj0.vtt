00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.850
This first option might look tempting and in fact the null hypotheses is

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.396
correct. But one problem with ANOVA is that we can only tell if at least one

00:00:08.396 --> 00:00:14.338
pair is significantly different. That's what makes our statistic big. We have

00:00:14.338 --> 00:00:18.876
one statistic that's either big or small. If we get a small statistic, we know

00:00:18.876 --> 00:00:23.036
that the within subject variability is large relative to the between subject

00:00:23.036 --> 00:00:29.220
variability. And none of the means are significantly different from each other.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.884
In that case, we would accept the null hypothesis. But if we get a large

00:00:32.884 --> 00:00:38.870
statistic, the opposite is true. The between subject variability is large.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.834
Relative to the within subject variability. In other words we might have some

00:00:42.834 --> 00:00:46.492
samples, and the means are different from each other, relative to each

00:00:46.492 --> 00:00:52.488
variability. But then we know that at least one pair of means is significantly

00:00:52.488 --> 00:00:58.330
different. So we accept the alternative hypothesis. But we don't know which

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.993
means are causing this large between subject variability. This means that when

00:01:02.993 --> 00:01:06.753
we're doing ANOVA, if we get a large test statistic and reject the null.

00:01:06.753 --> 00:01:09.987
There's an extra step that involves seeing which means are different from each

00:01:09.987 --> 00:01:15.820
other. These follow-up tests are generally called multiple comparison tests.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.040
And you'll learn about these in the next lesson.
