[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:09.350
SPEAKER 1: Good morning.

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.891
Good morning.

00:00:09.891 --> 00:00:11.560
Thank you all so
much for coming.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.980
Today at Google, we're delighted
to welcome Patty McCord.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.740
Patty is one of the
world's foremost experts

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.630
on company culture.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.900
She was an early
employee at Netflix,

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.800
and she was a co-author of
the famous Netflix culture

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.422
deck, which Sheryl
Sandberg said was

00:00:29.422 --> 00:00:30.880
one of the most
important documents

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.160
to come out of Silicon Valley.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.150
She's here today to discuss
her new book, titled "Powerful:

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.830
Building a Culture of Freedom
and Responsibility," which

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:46.300
was largely an effort
to sort of boil down

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.380
the message of the famous
Netflix culture deck.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.670
So please join me in welcoming
to Google Miss Patty McCord.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.932
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:01.120
PATTY MCCORD: So I'm
just going to couple--

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.090
how many people have seen
the Netflix culture deck?

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:06.750
A couple of you.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:07.720
I didn't write it.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.550
I didn't co-author it with Reed
Hastings, the CEO of Netflix.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.320
Reed and I did another
company before Netflix,

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.540
a company called Pure Software.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.510
We sold software tools to
other software engineers.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.180
And we grew through a
merger and acquisition.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.420
And how we grew was
we'd acquire a company,

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.790
and every time we'd acquire
a company, we'd double.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.930
So we were like
100, 200, 400, 6--

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:30.490
right.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.490
And then we sold the company
to our largest competitor.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.254
And my job was to
take their employee

00:01:35.254 --> 00:01:36.670
handbook and our
employee handbook

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.590
and smash them
together and come up

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.030
with the fewest policies
that would piss off

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.840
the fewest people.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.160
And so what we decided to do
at Netflix that was different

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.200
was pay attention to
the kind of company

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.780
that we were working
at, primarily

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.570
for totally selfish reasons.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.530
I didn't want to work with
brilliant assholes anymore.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.320
And I wanted to have
permission to say no.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.790
And Reed wasn't very tolerant
of people who weren't very smart

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.930
or weren't very
into the company.

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:10.570
So what we decided
to do differently,

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.970
for those of you that have
read the Netflix culture deck,

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.010
is just write stuff down.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.820
So my journey was not only to
write down what kind of company

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.340
that we wanted to
work at, my job was

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.960
to be the COO of that culture,
which meant if we said this,

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.850
then did we do this?

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.860
And that's the part where
most companies get it wrong.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.250
And I want you to
go away from my talk

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.724
today and think about
what you're doing here

00:02:35.724 --> 00:02:37.390
and what you're saying
you are as Google

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.300
and who you really
are acting as Google,

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.490
because that's what
company culture really is.

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.930
So since I've been away,
I get to talk to people

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.600
who are outside of
business and who

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.440
are people who are kind
of on the speaker circuit.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.440
So I end up onstage
with a lot of coaches,

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.650
like real sports coaches from
real professional sports teams.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.840
So I was in Montreal
last year in February.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.090
Has anybody been to
Montreal in February?

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.710
So cold.

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.450
It is so cold.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.047
So I called up my daughter,
and I said, hey, by the way,

00:03:16.047 --> 00:03:17.880
I'm doing this talk in
Montreal in February.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.311
She's like, Mom,
go to Patagonia.

00:03:19.311 --> 00:03:19.810
Go now.

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:20.860
Get a puffy coat.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.450
Get the big one.

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.920
So then I realized how dang cold
it is in Montreal in February.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.690
So I figure out
my hotel so that I

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.800
can go underground so that I
can go up to the venue, which is

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.330
a place called the Bell Centre.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.140
Does anybody know what happens
at the Bell Centre in Montreal?

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.740
No hockey fans, huh?

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:40.240
OK.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.480
Well, that's where the
Stanley Cup is played.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.220
Now, at this point
I've been talking

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.920
to groups who are a little
bigger than you, but not much.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.680
Like as if this room was full
is kind of my biggest audience.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.060
So I go down below.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.560
And at the last minute, they
said to me, oh, by the way,

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.200
you're not going to
be onstage alone.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.480
You're going to be with this
guy named Scotty Bowman.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.810
So I google Scotty Bowman,
and he's a hockey coach.

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.710
He's the winningest
hockey coach in history

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.480
in the National Hockey League.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.250
So I meet him underground.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.690
We're underground at this venue.

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.040
And he's this older gentleman.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.570
He's like 70, and he has on a
little suit with a maple leaf

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.820
pin and an American flag.

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.740
And we're talking
about his grandkids.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:25.810
And he says to me,
we're under the ice.

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.490
And then it occurs to me,
we're in a hockey stadium.

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.540
Like a hockey stadium.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:32.902
So it's not you guys.

00:04:32.902 --> 00:04:34.360
It's not this little
intimate room.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.660
I go up onstage, and my
face is on the Jumbotron.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.810
I mean, it's like huhhh!

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.010
And it's really scary.

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.890
And there's thousands of
people in the audience.

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:48.280
And so he introduces
me, nice introduction.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.750
The audience claps
very politely,

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.000
and I go sit on my
little velvet couch.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.080
And Scott Bowman comes up,
and the place goes crazy.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.180
I'm in Montreal in
a hockey stadium

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.130
with the winningest
hockey coach in history.

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:01.450
They're clapping like this.

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:02.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.240
If they had had
those foam fingers,

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.830
they'd be doing
the foam fingers.

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.860
I mean, people are
like, taking selfies.

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.560
Because I'm onstage
with God, as far as

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.520
they're concerned in Montreal.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.100
So he comes up.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.790
He sits down.

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.370
The master of ceremonies,
who has a diamond

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:23.770
earring and teleprompter, and
he's working the audience.

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:28.270
And he says, Mr. Bowman,
you're such a legend.

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:29.860
You've won so many tournaments.

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.050
You've played with
all the great players.

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.300
What does it take to
be a winning team?

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.560
How do you give people feedback?

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.890
And he says, well, we
have an 80-game season.

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:42.190
And every 10 games, I sit
down with each player,

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.590
and I do an assessment
of how they're doing.

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:45.850
They do a self-assessment.

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:47.526
We pull all the stats.

00:05:47.526 --> 00:05:49.150
We get feedback from
the other coaches.

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:50.890
We get feedback from
the other players.

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:53.689
We talk about who we're going to
play in the next 10 games, what

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:56.230
the competition is, where their
strengths and weaknesses are.

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.727
And we put together
a plan that we're

00:05:58.727 --> 00:06:00.310
going to execute for
the next 10 games

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.740
so that that person can be
an incredibly high performer.

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.830
So the guy says to
me, Patty McCord,

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:08.930
you've been known for
saying how much you hate

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.320
the annual performance review.

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:11.960
And I do.

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.870
I think it's an utter,
total waste of time for most

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:16.530
companies that do it that way.

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:19.550
And so he said, if you
didn't do that, what would

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:20.450
you do instead?

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:24.080
And I said, what he said.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.390
Because the thing is
that sports coaches

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:29.210
know how to put
together teams that win.

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.640
And that's really all
that management really

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.160
is, as far as I'm concerned.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.990
For 30 years, I've been watching
people put together teams.

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:38.090
And it's all about doing that.

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:41.240
And the reason I also put
the slide up that says team

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.250
is that-- and I
know you probably

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:45.290
don't say this much
here, but in case you

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:47.900
do-- you're not a family.

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:48.410
Right?

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:49.990
Work isn't your family.

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:51.530
It's not undying love.

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:54.230
You're not going to loan your
deadbeat brother-in-law money,

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:57.680
and he'll never pay you
back, because you always do.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:58.670
Because this is work.

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:00.470
And you come together
to do something

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:02.660
that you can only do here.

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:04.640
And that's create
terrific products

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.230
that make people happy.

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:09.230
And that joy, I
think, of working

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:10.990
is what really
makes people happy.

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:13.490
And I say that here
at Google, where you

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:16.280
have God's gift to everything.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.980
And I know that when you go
home and you say, oh my God, it

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.890
was an amazing day at
work, almost always

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:24.530
when you say that
truthfully from your soul,

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:26.540
it's because you
did something hard

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:29.840
with really smart people that
made you really effective.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:33.620
And that's my observations of
teams over all those years.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.900
And in order to
make it work, it's

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.810
about putting together
the right teams.

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:41.240
So because I started
as a recruiter,

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.460
I think a lot about talent.

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.770
And what I want to
talk to you about

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:49.760
is you today, because
I think I don't

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:53.990
need to lecture you guys about
how great organizations should

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:56.630
move fluidly and
be more flexible

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:59.480
and be more accepting of
change, because that's

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.620
the world that you live in.

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:04.460
But I want to talk to you
about how you navigate

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:06.480
through your own career.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:10.640
So I just did a talk
with 1,500 HR people.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:14.010
I know that's a frightening
idea for most of you.

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:15.830
It's even a frightening
idea for me.

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:17.810
Like when I first started
talking to HR people

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:20.420
before I wrote the
book, people walked out

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:23.390
because I said things
that really upset them.

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:26.669
But what I said was
to 1,500 HR people,

00:08:26.669 --> 00:08:28.460
please raise your hand
if you're in the job

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:31.010
that you had when you
graduated from college.

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:33.960
How many people
raised their hand?

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.620
None.

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:37.929
How many of you have
ever done a layoff?

00:08:37.929 --> 00:08:39.805
1,500 people raised their hands.

00:08:39.805 --> 00:08:41.929
How many of you have ever
laid off a family member?

00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:43.270
There's always one.

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:45.340
Don't ask me why,
but people do that.

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:46.660
Like somebody did.

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:49.780
And then I say, how many of
you have said the word family

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:50.320
at work?

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:53.890
And 900 people
raised their hands.

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:56.330
And I say, for all of you
that aren't in the same job,

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:59.320
you mean none of you could
work for a company that

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.350
could handle retention?

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:05.950
So the truth is that
our lives, our careers,

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:08.470
are full of lots
of different jobs

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:10.660
in lots of different
organizations.

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:12.850
And what I love about
Google these days

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:15.280
is that you've now
admitted that there's

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:18.280
lots of different organizations
in the corporation that

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:21.050
is Google, all the
alphabet companies.

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:24.160
So if you start thinking
about your career

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:25.930
and how you're going
to be successful

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:27.790
and how you're going
to move forward,

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:33.700
here's my hint from doing this
for a very, very long time.

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:36.430
Is what you love to do that
you are extraordinarily

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:39.520
good at doing something the
company you work for needs

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:41.244
someone to be great at?

00:09:41.244 --> 00:09:42.910
So if you wake up in
the morning and you

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:45.285
don't want to come to work,
or you're not looking forward

00:09:45.285 --> 00:09:47.460
to it and it seems
really horrible,

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:49.870
then something's wrong
with Patty's algorithm.

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:52.720
And I say algorithm because I
worked with geeks all my life,

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.790
and I love you and I miss you.

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:57.580
But if I say words like
algorithm, it helps, right?

00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:58.150
OK.

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:01.060
So what you love
to do that you're

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:02.740
extraordinarily good at doing--

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:04.430
is it important?

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:07.150
So when you find yourself
coming to work and thinking,

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:09.880
they just don't care about
how good I am at writing.

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.840
They don't even
realize how wonderful

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.270
I am, how talented I am.

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:16.300
They may realize
it and not care.

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:18.250
That's the honest truth.

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:20.410
And the other part is
if you need somebody

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:22.300
to be really, really
good and really, really

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:24.550
passionate about a problem
you're trying to solve,

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:28.140
and they can just do it,
but they don't love it,

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:30.460
then you're not happy on
the other side either.

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:32.290
So the reason why
I'm telling you this

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:35.170
is it's your job
to navigate this.

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:38.020
It's not somebody else's
job to suddenly realize

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:39.280
that you are unhappy.

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:42.040
Trust me, they know.

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:44.410
And it's not somebody
else's job to realize

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:46.840
that you went home thinking
this was the best working

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:47.680
day of your life.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.120
It's yours.

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:51.260
So as you go through
your work life,

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.320
I want you to be really
cognizant of what

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.200
you're learning, what you're
liking, what you're not liking.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.930
Half of what we
learn in our careers

00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:01.480
is the work that
we do that we hate.

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:02.980
I remember driving
away from a job

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:04.521
once, looking in
the rear-view mirror

00:11:04.521 --> 00:11:07.017
like, if I never see that
place again as long as I live.

00:11:07.017 --> 00:11:08.350
And then I tried to pin it down.

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:11.350
What was it about that
place that made me crazy?

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:13.660
And it was a company that
had thousands and thousands

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:17.260
of employees, and they
talked to them as head count.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:18.560
They didn't have names.

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:22.390
They were just head count to
be grown or shrunk or grown

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:23.440
or shrunk.

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.690
So that's the part about talent.

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:28.690
Your talent is really
important to wherever you work.

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:30.940
And you want to make sure
that you're in a place that

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.350
recognizes that.

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:35.940
And then the last thing I
wanted to talk to you about--

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:37.690
and since we're such
an intimate audience,

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:40.217
it'd be really fun if
you could talk to me.

00:11:40.217 --> 00:11:41.800
The last thing I
wanted to talk to you

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:44.030
about is the idea
of transformation.

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:47.680
So I spend a whole bunch of
time with really big companies

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:49.510
who invite me in to
talk about how they're

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:52.960
going to transform into
an agile tech company

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:54.310
like we have here in the valley.

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:56.320
And they have no clue.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:59.140
So they can't do
it, but you can.

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:01.660
And so the way to
create the workplace

00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:05.920
that you want to have is to be
vocal about it and to speak up.

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.870
And for us to start
talking to each other

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:11.170
really honestly about what
works and what doesn't work.

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:14.710
And I think that you can
have incredible conversations

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:16.000
about work.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.149
You know this story I told
you about Scott Bowman

00:12:18.149 --> 00:12:19.315
at the beginning of my talk?

00:12:22.746 --> 00:12:24.370
A couple of days ago,
a couple of weeks

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:26.170
ago, I was at this
thing in Texas.

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:29.380
And the coach of the
San Antonio Spurs--

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:31.810
it's a professional
basketball team-- was on.

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:33.970
And it was a very
touchy-feely audience.

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:38.585
And somebody said, oh, my
question for you, Coach,

00:12:38.585 --> 00:12:42.940
is it must be really horrible
when you have to cut people

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:46.000
from the team after you've put
all that energy into recruiting

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.340
them and having them
play a whole season

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:49.580
and they've done their best.

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:51.340
And doesn't that feel terrible?

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:53.860
And he said, no.

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:55.930
Actually it doesn't at all.

00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:57.704
Like, it's professional
basketball.

00:12:57.704 --> 00:12:59.620
You didn't sign up for
a lifetime appointment.

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:01.470
Everybody understands that.

00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:03.490
And I was in the
audience thinking,

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:06.840
why can't we just have
those conversations?

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.154
Why can't we have those
conversations with each other?

00:13:09.154 --> 00:13:11.320
We hired you to do this
thing, and you were amazing.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:11.920
Thank you.

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.650
We're done.

00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:15.530
That part's over.

00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:17.870
So now what are you
going to do next?

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:19.580
And what I think
about when I think

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:24.830
about Scotty's methodology
for giving people feedback,

00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:28.010
it's called a performance
improvement plan.

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:31.250
Too bad we ruined that word.

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:33.330
Like what if we actually
got together and said,

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:36.330
let's put together a plan so
that we can perform better?

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:39.080
What a concept.

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:41.400
But that's not what
we normally do.

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:45.440
And so that's why I think
real transformation comes

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:46.470
from two things.

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:50.510
One of them is to stop speaking
a language about management

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:55.060
that no one understands and just
be able to start telling people

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:56.000
the truth.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.250
I just don't love you anymore.

00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:58.060
I don't need you.

00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:01.390
Or maybe you need
something that's

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:03.760
more interesting and
stimulating over here.

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:06.280
Or maybe you should move on.

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:09.970
Or maybe you can
say, hey, look, I'm

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:11.680
looking at a lot of
other opportunities,

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.050
and I want to think about
what that means for me.

00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:17.410
That you can really have
those honest conversations.

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:23.280
And the second part is that you
can tell the truth about what

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:24.630
you want and what you need.

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:27.610
And your managers can tell you
the truth about the future.

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:30.600
And you can navigate your own
careers through all of that

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.970
and not wait for somebody
else to take care of you.

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:35.700
When I talk to women's
groups, I say, look,

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:40.950
employee engagement does not
mean somebody put a ring on it.

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:43.320
And interviewing
with another company

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:45.090
to find out what you're worth--

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:47.140
which is what you're
worth, by the way.

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:48.810
And if you feel like
you're underpaid

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:50.610
and you're waiting for
somebody to notice,

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:52.380
that is not going to happen.

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:54.060
Go find out what
you're worth, and that

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:55.670
happens with interviewing.

00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:57.630
Interviews get
you opportunities.

00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:58.810
Interviews get you jobs.

00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:01.810
You should be doing that
for the rest of your life.

00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:04.590
So when you find
yourself waiting

00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:07.990
for someone in management
to take care of you,

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:13.110
I want you to remember my words
and go take care of yourself,

00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:14.790
OK?

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:17.200
That's my talk for today.

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.910
Do you guys want to talk to me?

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:21.573
Let's do some Q&amp;A. Yeah.

00:15:21.573 --> 00:15:22.870
AUDIENCE: Do we have mikes or--

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:23.400
PATTY MCCORD: Do you have--

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:24.260
do we need mikes?

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.000
Yeah, in case we
put it in the video.

00:15:29.545 --> 00:15:33.160
The last slide is my book, which
there are some you get to have.

00:15:35.484 --> 00:15:37.900
AUDIENCE: So if you have an
organization, particularly one

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:40.690
like Netflix that had a
reputation for this, where

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:42.850
a certain number
of low performers,

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:44.891
you're going to churn
them out each year,

00:15:44.891 --> 00:15:46.390
how do you decide
where that bar is?

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:48.640
Do you target a certain
percentage of the organization

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:49.990
or absolute performance bar?

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:52.300
PATTY MCCORD: No, it was
never like that at all, ever.

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:52.799
Ever.

00:15:52.799 --> 00:15:54.820
So here's how it
typically happened.

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:56.380
I'll give you a story that--

00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:59.590
anybody here use DVD by mail?

00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:01.240
OK.

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:04.070
So we had grown.

00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:06.070
This is when we were
transitioning to streaming,

00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:08.530
when we were transitioning out
of the DVD by mail business

00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:10.330
into the streaming business.

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:13.492
And we had had an incredible
run that particular year.

00:16:13.492 --> 00:16:14.950
I don't remember
which year it was.

00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:16.960
But we'd grown 30%
quarter over quarter

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:19.540
for three quarters in a row.

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:21.335
So we're at our
executive staff meeting.

00:16:21.335 --> 00:16:22.960
And Reed wants to go
to the white board

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:24.914
and do disaster planning,
because he loves it.

00:16:24.914 --> 00:16:26.830
Like, what if it goes
to shit in a handbasket?

00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:28.180
That's his favorite thing to do.

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:32.925
So I say, hey, for sport,
what if it kept up?

00:16:32.925 --> 00:16:34.800
What if we kept growing
quarter over quarter,

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:37.049
30% quarter over quarter
compounded for the next three

00:16:37.049 --> 00:16:37.680
quarters?

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:39.300
CFO goes to the white board.

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:41.190
He's doing top line revenue.

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:44.330
And he's doing that happy
dance, like, look at the money.

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:47.300
Look at the money,
look at the money!

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:50.450
Ted Sarandos, who's our head
of content, says-- at the time,

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:56.840
we said wistfully, someday
we'll be as big as HBO.

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:58.880
And he says, shit, you guys.

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.070
That's next year.

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:03.429
It's possible that we'll
be as big as HBO next year.

00:17:03.429 --> 00:17:04.970
And we all just
looked at each other.

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:07.069
And Neil, who was our head
of product at the time,

00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:10.920
said, that's a third of
the US internet bandwidth.

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:12.962
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:12.962 --> 00:17:14.670
AUDIENCE: The ISPs
have noticed that too.

00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:17.240
PATTY MCCORD: And I'm
looking at him like, what?

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:20.270
So afterwards, he and I
are sitting there like,

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:23.160
does anybody know
how to do that?

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.700
'Cause files, video
files were so big.

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:26.812
You guys remember.

00:17:26.812 --> 00:17:28.020
You were around at that time.

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:31.190
I'm like, how do we do-- like,
we had a data center because we

00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:33.440
shipped DVDs by mail.

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:36.230
So we're brainstorming,
like, is it Google?

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:36.830
Is it Yahoo?

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:37.430
Is it eBay?

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:39.860
Who's moving that
much data that has--

00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:41.807
and it's got to be in
the cloud, clearly.

00:17:41.807 --> 00:17:43.640
We're not going to do
this in a data center.

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:47.320
So we sit down with our IT
guys, and they're brilliant.

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:50.380
These are brilliant,
wonderful, amazing people.

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:53.470
And we say, here's
the problem set.

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:55.480
And they say, no worries.

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:56.710
You guys go exec something.

00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:59.400
We'll build the cloud.

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.470
And I looked at them
and said, you know what?

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:04.230
If anybody on earth
could do this, it's you.

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:06.990
Not in nine months.

00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:08.250
We couldn't do that.

00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:11.090
It was just the time frame
was too short for these people

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:14.930
to be those experts to be able
to accomplish the business

00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:15.470
objective.

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:19.160
And we're certainly not
going to miss our window,

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:22.490
if it's there, because we
don't have the right IT team.

00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:27.650
So I said to them, that's
not going to happen.

00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:29.790
But we've got nine
months to figure it out.

00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:36.350
And so we turned, that
year, 97% of that team.

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:39.460
And most of them went on to
a company called Chegg, which

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:41.470
is a Netflix for textbooks.

00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:45.280
So they went, and they took
their physical shipping

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:49.090
and receiving database
skills to do that.

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:51.880
So that was typically
what happened.

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:54.400
Typically what happened was
we'd either build something

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:55.950
and it'd be done--

00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:59.230
and when I used to interview
Google people, people

00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:01.670
who had an offer with you
guys and an offer with us,

00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:04.900
I would say, look, two
different problem sets.

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:06.490
Organizing the
world's information

00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:08.980
is a big problem set.

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:11.020
We're delivering
movies and TV shows

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:14.090
to people's homes
or their devices.

00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:14.590
That's it.

00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:15.340
One problem.

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:16.420
That's all we do.

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:17.890
So that's typically
what happened.

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:20.362
So the DVD by mail
business still exists.

00:19:20.362 --> 00:19:21.820
I don't know if
you guys know that.

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:22.870
I still use it on my boat.

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:23.260
AUDIENCE: You still use it?

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:24.080
PATTY MCCORD: Yeah.

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:26.410
And it has a great catalog
because it has everything

00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:27.940
known to humankind
because you don't

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:30.790
have to buy rights for it.

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:33.430
But that business is probably--

00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:36.744
I bet there's not 100 people
in that business anymore.

00:19:36.744 --> 00:19:37.910
So that's more what happens.

00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:40.610
I know reputationally what
Netflix has a reputation for,

00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:41.720
but we never said--

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:43.130
why would we do that?

00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:47.430
If we said in chapter 2, we're
a high-performance culture,

00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:50.040
you don't have to cut the
bottom third performers

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:52.590
because you don't have them.

00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:55.140
And my experience is this.

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:58.450
If you hire somebody
who can't do the job,

00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:02.140
they are completely
without fault. That's

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:04.690
in the interview process.

00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:06.790
That person, that
candidate has no--

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:08.200
there's nothing they did wrong.

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:10.310
You hired the wrong person.

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:13.910
If you hire somebody and they're
close but no cigar, right?

00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:14.860
It's like, I love you.

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:15.526
I love you, man.

00:20:15.526 --> 00:20:17.780
I love you.

00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:19.370
Not really sure.

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:22.910
You can still do that,
but you should be honest.

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:25.182
Should be able to say
to you, you know what?

00:20:25.182 --> 00:20:27.390
You're not exactly the skill
set we were looking for,

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:28.190
but we love you.

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:30.650
And we're willing to take
the chance if you are.

00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:34.460
And then if it doesn't work
out, then it doesn't work out.

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:35.240
Everybody tried.

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:36.323
So that's what I'm saying.

00:20:36.323 --> 00:20:39.530
You can start being
honest in an interview.

00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:41.540
So that's more
typically what happens.

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:44.960
My experience is you
either join a company

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:47.150
that you think you're
intellectually going to like,

00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:49.310
and you don't when
you really get there.

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:51.500
Netflix was not a
particularly good place

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:58.060
for people who liked structure
or liked just R&amp;D work,

00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:01.572
because it was so
about deliverables.

00:21:01.572 --> 00:21:02.280
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:03.071
PATTY MCCORD: Sure.

00:21:06.504 --> 00:21:07.420
Right in front of you.

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:08.003
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:21:08.003 --> 00:21:08.790
PATTY MCCORD: Hi.

00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:09.873
AUDIENCE: I was wondering.

00:21:09.873 --> 00:21:12.660
You have the idea of
this generous severance

00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:17.540
package and the idea that
you let go of people easily.

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:19.830
Did you have to change
the company culture

00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:22.350
to get to the point where
that became acceptable,

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:22.990
or was that--

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:23.781
PATTY MCCORD: Yeah.

00:21:23.781 --> 00:21:26.560
It took-- if you go back and
read the Netflix culture deck,

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:30.090
we wrote each chapter after
the chapter before it.

00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:34.230
So when we said, we're going to
have a high-performance culture

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:39.960
of adults, and then we're going
to give them a lot of freedom,

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:42.450
it probably took
four years for me

00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:44.770
to figure out how to do that.

00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:46.810
So I had to figure out
the severance package.

00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:50.060
So let's say that,
in a typical company,

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:51.810
let's say we've hired
you to do something.

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:52.830
You've been here for years.

00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:53.550
You're amazing.

00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:54.175
You've done it.

00:21:54.175 --> 00:21:56.520
The DVD by mail guys, right?

00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:58.152
Don't need you anymore.

00:21:58.152 --> 00:22:00.360
Now I'm going to put you on
a performance improvement

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:02.550
plan for three months to
prove you're incompetent.

00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:04.750
But we both know you're not.

00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:07.370
Well, that's just mean.

00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:11.300
So instead, I would
say, you know what?

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:13.310
We've been talking about this.

00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:14.870
Can't wait to see
where you go next.

00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:17.690
I mean, half of my
Netflix alumni are here.

00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:20.930
So I can't wait to
see where you go next.

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:22.990
Here's three months' pay.

00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:24.814
Let's just not go
through this crazy stuff.

00:22:24.814 --> 00:22:26.230
There's just no
reason to do that.

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:29.020
So that's how I thought
about the severance packages,

00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:32.670
was if I did the thing
that people normally do

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:34.980
and instead just said,
how much is that worth?

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:36.910
Then I'd just paid you that.

00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:39.070
I also had to have an
incredible recruiting

00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:41.410
team that would hire
the people for the jobs

00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:43.640
that we needed getting
done in the future.

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:46.930
So that took me a long time, to
have a really, really top-notch

00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:48.190
recruiting team.

00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:51.700
I had to think about
competitive offers.

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:55.760
I had to think about head-count
dollars in terms of dollars,

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:58.250
not in terms of
number of people.

00:22:58.250 --> 00:22:59.200
So in most companies--

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:01.033
I don't know how it
works here-- but there's

00:23:01.033 --> 00:23:03.820
three ways you get a requisition
approved if you want to hire

00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:07.119
somebody in most companies.

00:23:07.119 --> 00:23:09.160
You write a job description
that either describes

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:12.700
the person who left that
you wish hadn't, a fantasy

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:15.400
person that doesn't
exist, or whatever

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.210
it takes to get it approved.

00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:20.880
None of those have anything
to do with actually hiring

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:22.890
somebody to solve the problem.

00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:25.980
And the truth is that when
you find somebody who's

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:27.990
really qualified to
solve the problem,

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:31.200
you should pay whatever
it takes to get them.

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:35.330
But in some organizations,
especially when

00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:38.210
I'm with startups, when they
get to step functional scale

00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:41.410
and I say, that new
team is not this team.

00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:43.620
You're not going to make
them into that, particularly

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:45.930
on problems of
complexity and scale.

00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:47.970
So that's how I
thought about it.

00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:51.000
I thought about it in
terms of the whole thing.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.370
How do we have not
just high performers,

00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:57.030
but high performers in each
job to solve each problem?

00:23:57.030 --> 00:23:59.010
That's the difference.

00:23:59.010 --> 00:24:02.380
AUDIENCE: Do you have any
kind of personnel development

00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:04.770
in that kind of world?

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:08.150
PATTY MCCORD: Yeah,
but not so formally.

00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:11.610
My experience is the
best way to develop

00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:14.100
is to be around
amazing people who

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:15.970
you learn from all the time.

00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:18.870
So I did a lot of
matching with people,

00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:20.640
putting people with
other people that they

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:21.750
could learn a lot from.

00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:24.150
And making-- we had
a lot of systems

00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:28.360
in place to share mostly
business information.

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:33.150
So a lot of our communication
and education in the company

00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:35.220
was around the business,
not necessarily

00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:37.740
around those skills.

00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:40.720
I think you learn best
when you can see it.

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:43.030
When you see somebody
behaving like a great manager,

00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:46.060
then you have a
great role model.

00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:48.190
AUDIENCE: Patty,
compensation teams

00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:50.230
love the annual
performance review

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:53.230
because it makes
annual increases,

00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:58.820
equity modeling, super simple,
perhaps even algorithmic.

00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:01.700
When you throw that
out in favor of lots

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:06.467
of feedback and conversations,
how do you connect the dots?

00:25:06.467 --> 00:25:08.050
PATTY MCCORD: I don't
have any problem

00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:09.710
with an annual
compensation review.

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:11.380
I think it's really smart.

00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:13.600
Actually, I recommend
that you do them quarterly

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:15.910
and walk through the
company quarterly.

00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:18.370
The most important way to
think about compensation

00:25:18.370 --> 00:25:20.480
is market-based pay.

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:24.310
And the most real compensation
information in your company

00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:28.210
is in your recruitment team,
not in last year's survey.

00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:29.740
That's what is really happening.

00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:31.448
You want to know what's
really happening.

00:25:31.448 --> 00:25:34.990
That's my problem with most
standard compensation teams,

00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:39.247
is they operate on systems and
with data that's really old.

00:25:39.247 --> 00:25:40.580
And I don't know if you guys do.

00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:43.060
I know that you guys are
more analytic than that.

00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:45.420
But so I would usually walk
through the organization

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:48.282
and say, where have I
hired a lot of people?

00:25:48.282 --> 00:25:49.990
Because where I've
hired a lot of people,

00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:52.540
that's going to give me really
current salary information.

00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:55.390
That's going to color how I pay
the people that are currently

00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:57.280
there that you want to stay.

00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:59.290
So I don't have any
problems at all with it.

00:25:59.290 --> 00:26:02.260
The problems I have
are when we take

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:06.700
the review and the
compensation and the feedback,

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:08.740
and we throw them all
together once a year.

00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:10.882
And we say it solves
those problems.

00:26:10.882 --> 00:26:12.340
So I was going to
tell you earlier,

00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:14.320
the most innovative
work I did at Netflix

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:15.770
was not anything new.

00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:17.590
It was just I stopped
doing old things that

00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:19.580
don't matter anymore.

00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:21.850
So that story I told
you about Scotty Bowman

00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:24.867
is a story about
giving great feedback.

00:26:24.867 --> 00:26:26.950
And if you're going to
give people great feedback,

00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:29.080
that's going to affect
their performance.

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:32.230
You're not going to
do it once a year.

00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:34.730
Name one other thing you do
once a year that you're good at.

00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:37.440
That would be nothing.

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:39.450
So great feedback--
so if you want

00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:42.990
to create a system that
says, I believe that feedback

00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:44.490
can improve performance.

00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:47.546
I want to create a
system that does that.

00:26:47.546 --> 00:26:50.170
Then who would ever come up with
the annual performance review?

00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:52.160
It's a dumb system to do that.

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:55.720
If you say, I want to have an
annual compensation review,

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:58.540
where I do a point-in-time
look across the organization

00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:01.210
and see is pay
working out fairly

00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:05.710
and equitably for people,
and is it market-based?

00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:06.950
Am I paying competitively?

00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:09.760
Then that's a completely
reasonable exercise to do.

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:12.430
There's where I have the
problem, is we mush it together

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:13.700
and we're not clear.

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:16.720
The other problem I have with
a lot of compensation systems

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:19.780
is they're not
transparent to employees.

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:22.940
It's magic that happens in HR.

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:24.986
And even some HR people
don't know how it works.

00:27:24.986 --> 00:27:27.360
The recruiting team doesn't
know how the comp team works.

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:29.150
It's just crazy stuff.

00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:31.160
So again, it's about--

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:35.540
like, I got rid of the--

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:39.740
when I was at Netflix, I
got rid of paid time off--

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:41.240
keeping track of paid time off.

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:43.940
I got rid of travel policies.

00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:47.360
And I got-- actually I didn't
get rid of these things.

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:50.840
I vetoed them before
we installed them.

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:53.600
The travel policy
and getting approvals

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:56.670
from finance for expenditures.

00:27:56.670 --> 00:27:59.980
It seemed insane
to me that I would

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:02.910
say, any expenditure
over $5,000 has to be--

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:05.510
or $10,000-- has to be
approved by finance.

00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:09.230
And I've got a company
full of PhDs in math.

00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:12.890
Like, they know that $10,001
is more than $10,000.

00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:15.410
They don't need somebody in
finance to tell them that.

00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:17.060
But they might need
somebody in finance

00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:20.210
to sit with them as an
analyst and tell them

00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:22.812
what things are happening
and how they're trending.

00:28:22.812 --> 00:28:23.520
Is this the hook?

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:24.690
Are you coming to hook me?

00:28:24.690 --> 00:28:26.150
Oh, because-- look
at your little--

00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:27.358
see, that's a Google problem.

00:28:27.358 --> 00:28:29.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.470
I told you I'd say that.

00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:32.167
Does that make sense to you?

00:28:32.167 --> 00:28:32.750
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:34.400
PATTY MCCORD: I don't have
any problem with the system.

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:36.140
It just needs to be transparent.

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:38.120
And it needs to be current.

00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:40.930
AUDIENCE: And because
you're paying top of market,

00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:44.130
the feedback is
kind of irrelevant.

00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:47.000
PATTY MCCORD: No, they're
two different things.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.990
They're two different things.

00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:50.610
AUDIENCE: Is there
pay for performance

00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:52.200
at Netflix, or not really?

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:55.460
PATTY MCCORD: There's
high performance.

00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:57.110
So you're going to
be paid top dollar

00:28:57.110 --> 00:29:00.680
for doing a fabulous job
with amazing people on time

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:02.450
with quality.

00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:04.730
So we're going to
just pay there.

00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:07.290
We're not going to pay like,
well, you did an OK job,

00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:09.770
so I'm going to give
you an OK raise.

00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:11.190
If you did an OK
job, we're going

00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:13.080
to talk about where
you're at and whether

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:15.690
or not you still
need to be there.

00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:18.680
And then how I determine
what pay is is market.

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:21.210
What are you worth
somewhere else?

00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:22.740
Listen, this true story.

00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:25.080
I would say to my
vice presidents,

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:26.475
go interview at Google.

00:29:26.475 --> 00:29:27.900
They're like, no.

00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:29.790
I'm not-- what are
you talking about?

00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:30.540
I love it here.

00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:31.200
I'm like, no, no, no.

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:31.710
Go.

00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:33.584
They're like, shit, in
Google it takes, like,

00:29:33.584 --> 00:29:34.820
seven weeks and five.

00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:37.530
I'm like, I want to know
what they're paying VPs.

00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:38.370
Just get your coat.

00:29:38.370 --> 00:29:39.300
Go interview.

00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:42.780
I would tell my employees,
look, when the recruiter calls,

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:45.540
before you say, no thanks,
be sure you say how much

00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:47.670
and come tell me.

00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:51.080
'Cause that's real comp data.

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:55.040
Real comp data is what
somebody else will pay you.

00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:58.450
So it's not just
paying people a lot.

00:29:58.450 --> 00:30:00.940
And it's not just paying
people for performance.

00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:02.770
It's almost the opposite.

00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:05.110
It's expecting
extraordinary performance

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:08.510
and paying you well for
the extraordinary work.

00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:12.760
And then the other thing
is not all jobs are equal,

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:16.260
and not all jobs are equally
as important to the company.

00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:17.690
So I do also--

00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:21.440
so I tend to talk to big
companies now, and lots

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:22.820
of startups.

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:25.460
So startup CEO dinner,
I'm up in the city.

00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:29.390
And one guy says,
well, you know,

00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:35.440
your high-performance thing,
you don't really mean everybody.

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:36.404
And I said, yeah, I do.

00:30:36.404 --> 00:30:37.820
I mean everybody--
you should have

00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:39.070
a high performer at every job.

00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:42.440
And he goes, yeah, but not
the ones that are unimportant.

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:43.650
And I said, well, really?

00:30:43.650 --> 00:30:46.090
Which job at your
company is not important?

00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:50.800
He goes, well, you know, like,
like payroll or something.

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:53.350
And I said, seriously?

00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:55.050
You don't what
somebody really good

00:30:55.050 --> 00:30:57.980
figuring out how to pay your
really brilliant engineers, who

00:30:57.980 --> 00:31:00.640
I'm sure are the ones
that are really important?

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:02.605
And he goes, well,
I'm just saying.

00:31:02.605 --> 00:31:04.480
I'm like, you don't want
them to be accurate?

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:06.070
He's like, well,
it's just they don't

00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:07.552
have to be like-- yes, they do.

00:31:07.552 --> 00:31:08.760
They have to be really great.

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:11.730
And I said, hey, by
the way, tip for you.

00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:13.430
Your finance
organization hates you.

00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:15.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:18.630
And he goes, I don't think you
know my finance organization.

00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:20.550
I'm like, oh, hell yeah, I do.

00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:22.620
You just told me,
a perfect stranger,

00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:26.270
you think your payroll
supervisor is stupid.

00:31:26.270 --> 00:31:29.060
They know you think
they're all stupid

00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:31.770
because they can't write code.

00:31:31.770 --> 00:31:34.320
It's a completely
different skill set.

00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:37.140
And furthermore, when
you're not looking,

00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:41.280
they're thinking of ways to
torture you, because that's

00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:42.823
what finance people do.

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:51.000
So yeah, I don't-- the pay for
performance thing works when

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.399
you, you know, what
you do is valuable,

00:31:53.399 --> 00:31:54.774
then you should
pay a lot for it.

00:31:57.257 --> 00:31:58.090
Do you want to yell?

00:31:58.090 --> 00:32:00.845
Or here-- here it comes.

00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:08.280
AUDIENCE: So how do you build a
culture of excellence like that

00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:16.170
without also creating a culture
of fear and ego and toxicity?

00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:18.480
PATTY MCCORD: Well,
fear is a hard one

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:22.500
to get rid of, because
part of it is adrenaline.

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:25.750
So I remember one time, one
of our executives was talk--

00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:27.300
one of them was, he
was talking about

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:30.120
that this particular year,
the things that we were going

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:33.200
to do and succeed at were
not going to be incremental,

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:35.100
they were going
to be monumental.

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:37.575
And he used climbing
K2 as his metaphor.

00:32:37.575 --> 00:32:38.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:39.570
Here we are.

00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:41.400
So at the end--

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:43.110
this had been a
big culture of fear

00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:44.820
was the new meme
around the company,

00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:46.320
and we're at this
executive meeting.

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:49.460
And it was bigger meeting,
quarterly business review.

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:51.270
And at the end, Reed
and I go to the front.

00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:52.320
We're answering questions.

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:54.030
And he says, I want
to hear you and Patty

00:32:54.030 --> 00:32:55.380
talk about the culture of fear.

00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:57.240
I'm like, oh, for God's sake.

00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:57.750
Really?

00:32:57.750 --> 00:33:01.980
So Reed says, well, you just
used the metaphor of K2.

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:06.840
You have to have oxygen.
And if you get halfway up

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:09.720
and a blizzard comes in, you
go back down to base camp,

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:12.760
there's no shame.

00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:15.340
This isn't for the timid.

00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:20.260
So the toxicity and
the egos, those people

00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:22.810
just don't need to
work there anymore.

00:33:22.810 --> 00:33:26.760
Somebody's got to
just ferret that out.

00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:28.740
And you have to--

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:33.300
that's why the culture of
honesty is so important,

00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:37.200
so that I can say to
you, hey, wait a minute.

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:40.230
Excuse me, but in this
meeting, she's still talking,

00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:42.690
and you just cut her off.

00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:44.180
So can you let her finish?

00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:45.240
Thanks.

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:47.760
And then you do, and she
lives, and life goes on.

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:50.010
You have to model
the right behavior.

00:33:50.010 --> 00:33:54.150
You have to be able to say, that
was a jerk move right there,

00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:56.280
buddy.

00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:59.320
I mean, you just have to be able
to have those conversations.

00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:01.681
It's the shitspering
that gets us in trouble--

00:34:01.681 --> 00:34:03.180
you know, talking
shit in a whisper?

00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:07.235
That's toxic.

00:34:10.350 --> 00:34:12.000
And you can be--

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.489
in my book, there's a
chapter about debate.

00:34:14.489 --> 00:34:19.280
We loved debate on
behalf of the customer,

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:22.280
on behalf of the customer,
on behalf of the customer.

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:25.969
And you can be pretty
worked up when you're

00:34:25.969 --> 00:34:27.679
talking about the product.

00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:32.179
I used to tell my HR team, we
are a service organization.

00:34:32.179 --> 00:34:37.920
It is not spelled
S-E-R-V-A-N-T-S.

00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:41.879
And the people that we
serve don't work here.

00:34:41.879 --> 00:34:44.170
The people that we serve are
our moms and our neighbors

00:34:44.170 --> 00:34:45.409
and ourselves.

00:34:45.409 --> 00:34:47.679
So it's our job to
put together teams

00:34:47.679 --> 00:34:50.710
that build incredible stuff.

00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:51.520
When I talk to my--

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:52.810
I've been gone six years.

00:34:52.810 --> 00:34:55.400
So it's a long time, and Netflix
is a very different company

00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:55.900
now.

00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:58.900
Netflix is a global
original content company.

00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:01.480
And what's very successful
for them now is they've

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:04.540
extended that culture of
freedom and responsibility

00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:05.740
to the creative talent.

00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:08.430
That's why they get
the people they get.

00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:11.140
That's why Shonda Rhimes wants
to work at Netflix and not

00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:14.730
at ABC, because nobody's walking
around telling her what to do.

00:35:17.124 --> 00:35:19.040
AUDIENCE: I'll hand over
the mike in a second.

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:20.020
Just like, how do--

00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:26.126
does it create a culture of,
like, competition [INAUDIBLE]??

00:35:30.104 --> 00:35:31.520
PATTY MCCORD: No,
because remember

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:34.390
how I started with team?

00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:37.270
So the thing about the
individual competing

00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:41.650
with individuals, that shouldn't
happen when you have a larger

00:35:41.650 --> 00:35:44.470
collective thing to do.

00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:46.000
I mean, it might
happen for you guys

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.250
because you have more products.

00:35:48.250 --> 00:35:51.940
But these teams
are formed to focus

00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:57.100
on solving a particular problem
in a particular time frame.

00:35:57.100 --> 00:36:02.240
And teams are formed to do
that because individuals can't.

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:02.900
They can't.

00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:03.950
That's the deal.

00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:06.860
I tell, back when I
talk to startup guys,

00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:09.170
again, I'm like, OK,
in your little startup,

00:36:09.170 --> 00:36:11.270
here's the first
sign of trouble--

00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:13.250
nostalgia.

00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:16.280
Remember how it used to be?

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:19.010
And I tell them, really
successful companies

00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:21.906
are not made of 50
people working 24/7.

00:36:21.906 --> 00:36:23.280
AUDIENCE: It's
not about product.

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:25.140
It's solving-- it's groups
that are solving a problem,

00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:26.040
like functional--

00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:27.165
PATTY MCCORD: That's right.

00:36:27.165 --> 00:36:29.400
Groups solving problems
that are clear to everybody.

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:32.080
So everybody has a role.

00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:34.050
So when people are
competing, then

00:36:34.050 --> 00:36:36.030
what are they competing for?

00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:38.700
Is it one meaty job and
you've got two people?

00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:40.680
That's what drives competition.

00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:44.340
Is it that you know that in
the end, there's only one job,

00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:46.860
and there's four people
trying to get it,

00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:49.520
instead of just picking one?

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:51.505
It goes back to
honesty, I think.

00:36:51.505 --> 00:36:52.380
SPEAKER 1: All right.

00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:53.546
We'll do two more questions.

00:36:53.546 --> 00:36:56.260
Over there, I think,
and then over here.

00:36:56.260 --> 00:36:57.510
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:36:57.510 --> 00:36:58.551
I actually read the book.

00:36:58.551 --> 00:36:59.852
PATTY MCCORD: Ah.

00:36:59.852 --> 00:37:00.810
AUDIENCE: Amazing book.

00:37:00.810 --> 00:37:02.640
Thank you very
much for the book.

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:04.710
One big impression I
actually got from the book

00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:07.310
is one of the major
components for Netflix

00:37:07.310 --> 00:37:08.940
to sustain such a
culture and model

00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:11.460
is to have a very powerful
and strong recruiting team.

00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:12.210
PATTY MCCORD: Yes.

00:37:12.210 --> 00:37:14.850
AUDIENCE: And the HR
department was [INAUDIBLE]..

00:37:14.850 --> 00:37:19.290
My question is, I guess for
a smaller company, maybe

00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:22.860
a startup or even Netflix
in its early days,

00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:24.440
where the recruiting
in HR is not

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:30.117
as strong as it is right now,
is such a culture sustainable?

00:37:30.117 --> 00:37:31.950
PATTY MCCORD: Well,
since you read the book,

00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:35.430
you know that the other
secret of the great recruiting

00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:38.940
team at Netflix is that it's
not the great recruiting team's

00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:40.470
job to recruit people.

00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:42.160
It's everybody's.

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:45.690
And the number one job
of a hiring manager

00:37:45.690 --> 00:37:48.600
is to know the right talent
to build an amazing team that

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:51.540
gets quality work done on time.

00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:53.040
And so I used to say--

00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:55.120
I'll tell you this
one last story.

00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:57.750
Back in the day, when I was a
software engineering recruiter,

00:37:57.750 --> 00:38:01.140
I studied the habits
of software engineers.

00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:04.680
And so I happened to
know that there's always

00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:08.130
that weird ethnic
restaurant in the strip mall

00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:10.069
that is the place du
jour that you eat.

00:38:10.069 --> 00:38:11.610
This is before we
all had restaurants

00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:12.880
all over our campuses.

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:16.050
So I'd go find that little
Thai place in Cupertino.

00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:19.440
And in the lobby,
they'd have the fishbowl

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:21.970
you put your business card
in, you get a free lunch.

00:38:21.970 --> 00:38:24.690
Do you guys still go to those
funky little strip mall joints?

00:38:24.690 --> 00:38:27.900
And I'd go, and I'd
just take the fishbowl.

00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:29.710
And I'd go to the
back and dump it out.

00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:31.502
This is in the old days
before cell phones.

00:38:31.502 --> 00:38:33.626
And I'd just dump it out,
write down all the names,

00:38:33.626 --> 00:38:35.280
and go back to work
and call them all,

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:37.488
because it was where all
the software engineers work.

00:38:37.488 --> 00:38:41.250
And now I say, that's why
God gave us LinkedIn now.

00:38:41.250 --> 00:38:42.180
So you can do that.

00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:44.340
You should be looking
for members of your team

00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:44.890
all the time.

00:38:44.890 --> 00:38:45.930
It's everybody's job.

00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:48.840
It's HR's job to
facilitate it and to really

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:51.420
understand what the market is
and where to go get people.

00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:54.150
But it's everybody's job
to bring great talent in.

00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:55.330
And that's the difference.

00:38:55.330 --> 00:38:57.240
It's not just a great
recruiting team.

00:38:57.240 --> 00:38:59.430
And my great recruiting
team was, and is,

00:38:59.430 --> 00:39:01.710
so great there because
they feel like they're

00:39:01.710 --> 00:39:03.540
partners in bringing in talent.

00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:06.702
They're not recruiters in HR.

00:39:06.702 --> 00:39:07.660
Do you have a question?

00:39:10.157 --> 00:39:10.990
AUDIENCE: Hi, Patty.

00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:13.510
My question is how do
you evaluate or think

00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:15.130
of high performance
in the context

00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:19.690
of very ambitious and risky
projects that didn't go well?

00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:22.450
PATTY MCCORD: Well, I think you
figure out what you wanted to--

00:39:22.450 --> 00:39:24.160
you do it like
any other software

00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:26.740
product, any other product.

00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:29.050
You postmortem it.

00:39:29.050 --> 00:39:31.600
When it didn't go well,
you stop and say--

00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:33.730
you pause, and you
get the team together

00:39:33.730 --> 00:39:36.620
and say, what should we
have done differently?

00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:37.880
Did we mis-scope it?

00:39:40.650 --> 00:39:45.140
Did we miss the readiness of
the product for the customer?

00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:46.450
Was it the wrong team?

00:39:46.450 --> 00:39:48.350
Were we unclear about goals?

00:39:48.350 --> 00:39:51.250
So I mean, everything
I learned about people,

00:39:51.250 --> 00:39:54.280
I learned from product managers.

00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:56.956
You start with the end,
and you work your way back.

00:39:56.956 --> 00:39:58.330
What are we trying
to accomplish?

00:39:58.330 --> 00:39:59.420
What's it going to look like?

00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:00.461
What's quality look like?

00:40:00.461 --> 00:40:01.525
When's the delivery date?

00:40:01.525 --> 00:40:03.400
That's the other thing
we don't do very well,

00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:05.830
is put time wrappers on stuff.

00:40:05.830 --> 00:40:07.870
So it's like, so yeah,
we accomplished it,

00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:09.070
but it was six months late.

00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:11.890
What should we
have known when we

00:40:11.890 --> 00:40:14.320
made that date at the beginning
that we didn't know now?

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:16.000
So that's the part about--

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.440
you talked about development.

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:20.170
That's the continuous learning
part that I think all of us

00:40:20.170 --> 00:40:23.090
should do as teams.

00:40:23.090 --> 00:40:23.750
Make sense?
