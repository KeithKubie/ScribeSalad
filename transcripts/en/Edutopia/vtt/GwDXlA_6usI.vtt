00:00:09.296 --> 00:00:14.146
&gt;&gt;The issue we're discussing here
in terms of multimedia literacy is

00:00:14.146 --> 00:00:20.346
that we stress so hard learning
English and learning English grammar

00:00:20.346 --> 00:00:24.196
and then we shove music and art

00:00:25.396 --> 00:00:29.526
and most schools don't
even get into cinema.

00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:34.006
We move those over into some
sort of artistic which means sort

00:00:34.006 --> 00:00:36.016
of therapeutic or fun thing.

00:00:37.436 --> 00:00:41.046
It's not approached as a very
valid form of communication.

00:00:41.786 --> 00:00:43.546
Kids know this.

00:00:43.546 --> 00:00:48.476
When you take a five year old,
they can speak, they can use words,

00:00:49.206 --> 00:00:50.846
they don't know how
to write very well

00:00:50.846 --> 00:00:54.626
and they may not know much
grammar, but they know how to speak,

00:00:54.626 --> 00:00:58.416
they also know music, they may
not know the grammar of music,

00:00:58.646 --> 00:01:01.996
they know cinema because they spend
a huge amount of time in front

00:01:01.996 --> 00:01:03.706
of the television so they
know visual communication,

00:01:03.706 --> 00:01:04.696
they know the moving image.

00:01:05.316 --> 00:01:07.556
They intuitively know
a lot of the rules,

00:01:08.356 --> 00:01:09.646
but nobody's actually
taught them anything,

00:01:09.646 --> 00:01:12.696
anymore than they've taught them
anything about grammar in English.

00:01:12.976 --> 00:01:15.186
So we go through school
and then later on we start

00:01:15.186 --> 00:01:19.636
to learn the grammar of English, you
have punctuation, capital letters,

00:01:20.226 --> 00:01:22.996
you'll run on sentences,
what a verb is.

00:01:23.966 --> 00:01:27.796
But nobody teaches anybody
about what screen direction is,

00:01:28.506 --> 00:01:33.756
what perspective is, what color
is, what a diagonal line means.

00:01:34.616 --> 00:01:37.106
Those are rules; those
are grammatical rules

00:01:37.106 --> 00:01:39.336
that appear in an art class.

00:01:39.336 --> 00:01:42.316
If you've taken art class, the first
thing you'll do is get into graphics

00:01:42.876 --> 00:01:45.616
and you start learning well
a jagged line means this

00:01:45.616 --> 00:01:48.626
and a blue color means this
or red color means that.

00:01:48.626 --> 00:01:51.466
So if you're trying to convince
somebody that what you want

00:01:51.466 --> 00:01:55.636
to do is excite them, then
you use red or yellow.

00:01:55.636 --> 00:01:59.606
If you're doing it with music
then you use a fast rhythm,

00:01:59.836 --> 00:02:00.676
not a slow rhythm.

00:02:01.576 --> 00:02:04.766
You don't have to teach them
necessarily how to read music

00:02:04.766 --> 00:02:08.636
and you don't need to have to
teach them how to be an artist,

00:02:08.636 --> 00:02:11.936
but you do have to teach them how
to use the grammar of the language.

00:02:11.986 --> 00:02:16.336
Somehow we've gotten to the point
where the words have gotten way

00:02:16.336 --> 00:02:18.656
up here and these other forms of
communications, which all started

00:02:18.656 --> 00:02:22.906
out equal and at the beginning,
much more equal before we had words.

00:02:23.616 --> 00:02:27.776
Somehow in the educational system
they'll need to be balanced out.

00:02:28.586 --> 00:02:31.926
So the kids could communicate using
all of the forms of communication,

00:02:32.486 --> 00:02:38.096
not just put it into little
categories and say you really need

00:02:38.096 --> 00:02:41.946
to learn how to use a verb;
that's much more important

00:02:41.946 --> 00:02:45.076
than learning perspective or
learning screen direction.

00:02:46.526 --> 00:02:52.016
But it's not really, especially in
this day and age where the power

00:02:52.016 --> 00:02:55.696
of multimedia is coming
to the children.

00:02:55.696 --> 00:02:58.396
It used to be like with cinema,

00:02:59.096 --> 00:03:03.106
only the very elite
professionals worked in this medium.

00:03:04.856 --> 00:03:07.266
But now anybody can work in it.

00:03:07.466 --> 00:03:09.896
&gt;&gt;Are we talking about
a new way of teaching?

00:03:09.896 --> 00:03:11.756
&gt;&gt;It is a different way of teaching

00:03:11.906 --> 00:03:15.646
in that I think English classes
should broaden themselves

00:03:15.646 --> 00:03:19.926
and my personal thing &lt;inaudible&gt;
I think we should rename English

00:03:20.596 --> 00:03:23.046
to be-- I mean I know in some
schools we call it language arts,

00:03:23.556 --> 00:03:25.436
but I think it should be
renamed communication.

00:03:25.996 --> 00:03:29.386
It's a communication class and
you learn the English language,

00:03:29.466 --> 00:03:33.046
learn how to write, you learn
grammar, but you also learn graphics.

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:36.816
If you take graphics out of the art
department, take cinema and put it

00:03:36.816 --> 00:03:39.476
into the schools, take music
out of the music department.

00:03:39.676 --> 00:03:42.746
If you want to learn how to play an
instrument, if you want to learn how

00:03:42.746 --> 00:03:46.056
to be a composer, then you can
go to the music department.

00:03:46.096 --> 00:03:50.526
If you want to learn how to do
beautiful renditions of paintings

00:03:50.526 --> 00:03:54.326
and follow the great artists
then you go into art class.

00:03:54.326 --> 00:03:56.226
But if you really want to
just learn how to communicate,

00:03:56.226 --> 00:04:00.606
then what is the basic
grammar of communication then

00:04:00.606 --> 00:04:02.906
that should be taught basically
in the communications class,

00:04:02.906 --> 00:04:05.896
it shouldn't be taught in
some esoteric arty thing,

00:04:05.896 --> 00:04:10.816
it should be taught as a very
practical tool that you use to sell

00:04:10.816 --> 00:04:15.006
and influence people and
to get your point across

00:04:15.006 --> 00:04:16.896
and to communicate to other people.
