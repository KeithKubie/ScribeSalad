can find it like your local dollar store
or hardware store hobby shop I'm going

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300
or hardware store hobby shop I'm going
 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.790
or hardware store hobby shop I'm going
to go over some of the core materials

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800
to go over some of the core materials
 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.350
to go over some of the core materials
that we're going to use and then we'll

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360
that we're going to use and then we'll
 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.599
that we're going to use and then we'll
to start building and see what happens

00:00:41.599 --> 00:00:41.609
 
 

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:43.040
 
all right well these are some of the

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050
all right well these are some of the
 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.750
all right well these are some of the
materials we're going to use eyes are

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760
materials we're going to use eyes are
 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.130
materials we're going to use eyes are
our base kind of core materials

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140
our base kind of core materials
 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.319
our base kind of core materials
materials you might use my vary a little

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329
materials you might use my vary a little
 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.189
materials you might use my vary a little
bit but the base for this whole thing is

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199
bit but the base for this whole thing is
 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.020

going to be this Iron Man mask now I

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030
going to be this Iron Man mask now I
 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.119
going to be this Iron Man mask now I
actually found this at a 5 below which

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129
actually found this at a 5 below which
 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.649
actually found this at a 5 below which
is kind of like a dollar store but

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:57.659
is kind of like a dollar store but
 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:00:59.329
is kind of like a dollar store but
everything's 5 bucks or less this was

00:00:59.329 --> 00:00:59.339
everything's 5 bucks or less this was
 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:01.520
everything's 5 bucks or less this was
like four or five dollars there's like a

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530
like four or five dollars there's like a
 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.109
like four or five dollars there's like a
bin of them I bought a bunch of them

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:03.119
bin of them I bought a bunch of them
 

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:05.509

child's helmet this will actually be
 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.279
child's helmet this will actually be
like the back of the helmet and I think

00:01:10.279 --> 00:01:10.289
like the back of the helmet and I think
 

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:12.050
like the back of the helmet and I think
we'll probably use this for the eyes and

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060
we'll probably use this for the eyes and
 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.180

plastic weld it's a two-part epoxy putty

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590
plastic weld it's a two-part epoxy putty
 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.089
plastic weld it's a two-part epoxy putty
like a plumber's putty but when you wet

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099
like a plumber's putty but when you wet
 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.270

your hands it actually becomes really

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280
your hands it actually becomes really
 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.149
your hands it actually becomes really
easy kind of I'm going to manipulate it

00:02:14.149 --> 00:02:14.159
easy kind of I'm going to manipulate it
 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:16.190
easy kind of I'm going to manipulate it
a little bit easier lasts a little bit

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200
a little bit easier lasts a little bit
 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.690
a little bit easier lasts a little bit
longer and you can smooth it really nice

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700
longer and you can smooth it really nice
 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.160
longer and you can smooth it really nice
with your fingers now let's just start

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170
with your fingers now let's just start
 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:03:05.730
with your fingers now let's just start
building and see what happens

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740
 
 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:04:10.610
 
you

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620
 
 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:06:27.250
 
you

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:27.260

you

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:43.190
 
 

00:07:43.190 --> 00:08:26.050
 
you

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:26.060
 
 

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:47.260
 
all right

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:47.270
 
 

00:08:47.270 --> 00:09:22.970
 
you

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:22.980
 
 

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:26.240
 
all right so it's coming along it's um

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:26.250
all right so it's coming along it's um
 

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:28.470
all right so it's coming along it's um
it's it's kind of starting to take shape

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:28.480
it's it's kind of starting to take shape
 

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:32.520
it's it's kind of starting to take shape
now I just kind of glued these with a

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:32.530
now I just kind of glued these with a
 

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:36.360
now I just kind of glued these with a
hot glue gun just sort of temporarily

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:36.370
hot glue gun just sort of temporarily
 

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:38.100
hot glue gun just sort of temporarily
just to see how it kind of all looks

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:38.110
just to see how it kind of all looks
 

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:41.580
just to see how it kind of all looks
before I apply any adhesive or putty in

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:41.590
before I apply any adhesive or putty in
 

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:46.290
before I apply any adhesive or putty in
any of the other spots there but yeah

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:46.300
any of the other spots there but yeah
 

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:48.600
any of the other spots there but yeah
that's taking seeds yeah it's starting

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:48.610
that's taking seeds yeah it's starting
 

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:54.300
that's taking seeds yeah it's starting
to look a little similar I'm just going

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:54.310
to look a little similar I'm just going
 

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:56.850
to look a little similar I'm just going
to use these aluminum tubes I can find

00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:56.860
to use these aluminum tubes I can find
 

00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:01.770
to use these aluminum tubes I can find
these at basically any hobby store Hobby

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:01.780
these at basically any hobby store Hobby
 

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:05.400
these at basically any hobby store Hobby
Lobby or Michaels or any model building

piping and tubing stuff come out she

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:24.460
piping and tubing stuff come out she
 

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:27.180
piping and tubing stuff come out she
worked great LT looks like you can also

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:27.190
worked great LT looks like you can also
 

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:31.800
worked great LT looks like you can also
probably use aluminum wire to line all

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:31.810
probably use aluminum wire to line all
 

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:33.120
probably use aluminum wire to line all
the elements and stuff like that

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:33.130
the elements and stuff like that
 

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:36.750
the elements and stuff like that
probably work just as good but yeah

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:36.760
probably work just as good but yeah
 

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:38.460
probably work just as good but yeah
that's it so far

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:38.470
that's it so far
 

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:41.160
that's it so far
keep blowing you know plugging along I

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:41.170
keep blowing you know plugging along I
 

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:44.400
keep blowing you know plugging along I
think next we're going to cut the kid's

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:44.410
think next we're going to cut the kid's

star lowered mask all in all turned out

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:25.110
star lowered mask all in all turned out
 

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:27.470
star lowered mask all in all turned out
pretty well I thought it looks pretty

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:27.480
pretty well I thought it looks pretty
 

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:28.930
