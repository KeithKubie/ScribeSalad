00:00:07.138 --> 00:00:13.369
In a Moment of Vision...

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:14.856
It's the 1920s.

00:00:14.856 --> 00:00:16.712
Johnson and Johnson is well-established

00:00:16.712 --> 00:00:19.928
for their production of large, 
cotton gauze dressings

00:00:19.928 --> 00:00:22.409
that are sterile and sealed against germs,

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:24.660
a first of its kind.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.779
An employee by the name of Earle Dickson

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.070
is recently married to a young,
rather accident-prone woman.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.128
Her domestic cuts and burns are too minor
for the company's large surgical dressings

00:00:36.128 --> 00:00:38.349
so Earle, in a moment of vision,

00:00:38.349 --> 00:00:42.897
cuts a small square of the sterile gauze
and secures it to her finger

00:00:42.897 --> 00:00:44.479
with an adhesive strip.

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:49.008
Earle is forced to make so many
of these bandages for his clumsy wife,

00:00:49.008 --> 00:00:52.740
he devises a method for a small
production of them.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.519
In order to keep the adhesive part
from sticking together,

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:58.938
he lines them with a crinoline fabric.

00:00:58.938 --> 00:01:02.838
Johnson and Johnson begins production
of Earle's invention.

00:01:02.838 --> 00:01:05.239
In a brilliant marketing move,

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.059
they distribute, for free, an unlimited
number of Band-Aids

00:01:09.059 --> 00:01:12.420
to all the Boy Scout Troops
across America.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.022
It doesn't take long for them to become
a household item.

00:01:16.022 --> 00:01:18.462
It is estimated that Johnson and Johnson

00:01:18.462 --> 00:01:22.737
has since made more than 
100 billion Band-Aids.
