00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:05.920
I’m Desmond Wong,

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.259
my company is “The Gentlebros”.

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:08.910
We started about 3 years ago.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.480
The game we are working on is called “Cat Quest”,

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.460
which is an open world RPG.

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:14.960
After the first bootcamp, coming back 2 months later,

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.470
I’ve personally become a better producer.

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.140
The mentors have generally helped us

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.820
with monetisation methods,

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.100
and how else we can make more revenue

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.200
out of the game like putting in

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.500
in-app purchases or maybe DLCs.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.200
Pricing models, like maybe certain prices

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.380
will work better in other places.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.080
Learning from the mistakes they’ve made,

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.620
the lessons they could share

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.300
was all extremely amazing

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.740
Game development is tough,

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.860
but keep at it and you are gonna get there someday.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.100
Do not ever give up on your dreams.
