00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.420
When you look at a diagram of the solar system,
you’ll see a big gap between Mars and Jupiter.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.830
A few centuries ago, that gap bugged astronomers;
they really wanted there to be a planet in there.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.840
On the first day of the 19th century—January
1, 1801—they got their wish. Kinda. Italian

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.189
astronomer Giuseppi Piazzi found a point of
light moving at just the right speed to be

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.719
the desired planet, but it was just a dot,
and too faint to physically be a terribly

00:00:29.719 --> 00:00:34.619
big object. He suspected it might be a comet,
but follow-up observations showed it wasn’t

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.100
fuzzy. The object was given the name Ceres…
but was it really a planet?

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.460
Well...

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.080
Hopes were high that Ceres was the wished-for
planet between Mars and Jupiter. But then

00:00:55.089 --> 00:01:00.359
something rather amazing happened: A little
over a year later, in 1802, another one was

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.820
found. Then, in 1804, astronomers spotted
a third one, and a fourth in 1807.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.550
It was becoming clear that a new class of
solar system object had been discovered. Given

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.250
that they were all just dots in the telescopes
of the time, points of light like stars, they

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.940
were given the name “asteroids”, which
literally means star-like.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.730
By the end of the 19th century more than 450
had been found in total. The rate of discovery

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.980
has accelerated over the years, and now, today,
we know of hundreds of thousands. There are

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.880
probably billions—yes, billions—of them
larger than 100 meters across in the solar

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.180
system, and over a million larger than 1 km
in size.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.300
So what are we dealing with here? What are
these asteroids?

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.360
There’s not really a hard-and-fast definition
of what’s an asteroid and what isn’t.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.520
But generally speaking, it’s a class of
smaller bodies that are rocky or metallic

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.260
that orbit the Sun out to Jupiter. Objects
past Jupiter have special designations that

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.670
we’ll get to in the next episode.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.840
Over the centuries we’ve learned a lot about
them by scrutinizing them with telescopes.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.820
Asteroids come in a few basic flavors. Most,
of them, about 3/4, are carbonaceous, which

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.670
means they have lots of carbon in them. About
1/6th are silicaceous—heavy on the silicon-based

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.999
materials, y’know, rock. The rest are lumped
into one catch-all category, but are dominated

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:18.129
by metallic objects, literally loaded with
iron, nickel, and other metals.

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:22.239
So many of them orbit the Sun between Mars
and Jupiter that this region is now called

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:26.480
the Main Belt. The Main Belt has structure;
for example, there are very few asteroids

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.329
about 425 million kilometers from the Sun.
An asteroid at that distance would have an

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:36.459
orbital period of about 4 years; a simple
fraction of Jupiter’s 12 year period. Any

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.209
asteroid there would feel a repeated tug from
Jupiter’s mighty gravity, pulling it out

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.159
of that orbit. The resulting gap is called
the Kirkwood Gap, and there are several such

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:49.530
asteroid deserts, all with simple multiples
of Jupiter’s period. In this way, the main

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.920
belt is like Saturn’s rings, whose gaps are
carved out by the gravity of the orbiting moons.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.400
Another way to group asteroids is by orbit;
some have similar orbits and may have formed

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:02.840
from a bigger, parent asteroid that got disrupted
by an impact. These groups are called families,

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.260
and there are a few dozen known. For example,
the Eunomia family has over 400 members, and

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:14.620
are silicaceous, rocky asteroids and probably all formed
from a parent body that was about 300 km across.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.380
When you watch movies, they always show spaceships
dodging and swooping through asteroid belts,

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.800
trying to evade the bad guys. But in reality
our asteroid belt is mostly empty space! On

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.060
average, decent-sized asteroids are millions
of kilometers apart; so far that if you stood

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.600
on an asteroid, odds are good you wouldn’t even
be able to see another one with your naked eye.

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:38.999
And despite their huge numbers, they don’t
add up to much. If you took all the asteroids

00:03:38.999 --> 00:03:43.189
in the main belt and lumped ‘em together
they’d be far smaller than our own Moon!

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:48.319
Ceres is the biggest, at about 900 km across.
It’s round, nearly spherical due to its

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:50.340
own gravity crushing it into a ball.

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.560
A funny thing about Ceres: As we write and
record this episode, it’s being visited

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.249
for the first time, by a spacecraft named
Dawn. That means everything I tell you about

00:03:59.249 --> 00:04:04.809
this asteroid is probably about to be obsolete.
But we do know a few things. Ceres probably

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:10.249
has a rocky core surrounded by a water ice
mantle. The amount of water in it is staggering;

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:14.889
probably more than all the fresh water on
Earth! It may even be liquid under the surface,

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:16.780
like the oceans of Enceladus and Europa.

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.430
Early images by Dawn as it approached the
asteroid show its surface is heavily cratered,

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.030
and some craters are very bright; they may
be exposing ice under the surface, or just

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.800
fresher, brighter material. There are tantalizing
observations of localized water vapor on the

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.449
surface, which may be from sublimation; ice
turning directly into a gas due to the Sun’s

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:38.209
heat, or it might indicate cryovolcanoes.

00:04:38.209 --> 00:04:43.800
Dawn also visited Vesta, which is the third
largest but second most massive asteroid known.

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:49.930
Vesta is round…ish, what’s called an oblate
spheroid, flattened a bit like a ball someone’s

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:55.070
sitting on. The southern hemisphere got hammered
by impacts long ago, leaving a huge basin there.

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.400
Several other main-belt asteroids have been
visited by spacecraft, mostly via flybys.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.780
Lutetia, Gaspra, Steins, Mathilde. Ida is
another, and was discovered to have a small

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.550
moon orbiting it. In fact, a lot of asteroids
have moons or are actually binary, with two

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:14.450
similarly-sized bodies in orbit around each
other. Kleopatra, a weird dog bone-shape rock,

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:15.460
has two moons!

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.539
You might think asteroids are just giant versions
of rocks you might find in your garden; tough,

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:26.360
solid, singular bodies. But it turns out that’s
not the case. A few years ago scientists realized

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.370
that asteroids have spent billions of years
whacking into one another -- sometimes in

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:35.780
high-speed collisions, sometimes more slowly.
Slower hits can disrupt the asteroid, crack it,

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:40.120
but not necessarily be strong enough to
actually disrupt it so that it breaks apart.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.419
Over time, enough hits like that can leave
behind what’s called a rubble pile: Individual

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:49.550
rocks held together by their own gravity,
like a bag of gravel, or a car window that’s

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.759
been cracked and still holds its overall shape.

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:56.699
This became more clear when the Japanese Hayabusa
spacecraft visited the asteroid Itokawa, and

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:01.750
saw what can only be described as a jumbled
mess. The asteroid had no craters on it, and

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:06.220
was littered with rubble and debris. It was
also very low density, just what you’d expect

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:07.939
for a loosely bound rock pile.

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:12.110
It’s weird to think of some asteroids as
being not much more than free-floating bags

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:17.539
of gravel, but the Universe is under no obligation
to adhere to our expectations. It’s full

00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:20.099
of surprises, and we need to keep our minds
flexible.

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:23.419
So here’s a question: why is there even
a main asteroid belt at all?

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:28.099
The solar system formed from a disk of material,
and over time, that material started to clump

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:33.129
into bigger and bigger pieces. As planets
formed, they swept up and pulled in lots more

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:37.789
stuff, and grew large. Jupiter consumed a
lot of the material around it, but not all,

00:06:37.789 --> 00:06:40.169
and left a lot of debris inside its orbit.

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:44.419
Some of this clumped together to form middling-sized
objects, probably smaller than the planets

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:50.310
we have now, but big enough to undergo differentiation:
Heavy stuff like metals sank to the middle,

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:54.759
and lighter stuff formed a mantle and crust.
Collisions broke almost all of them apart,

00:06:54.759 --> 00:06:58.650
though, and that’s why we see asteroids
with different compositions: Some are from

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:01.560
the denser core, others from the lighter crust.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:06.099
There was probably a lot more material between
Mars and Jupiter billions of years ago, but

00:07:06.099 --> 00:07:10.539
it either got eaten by Jupiter, or the planet’s
immense gravity altered the asteroids’ orbits,

00:07:10.539 --> 00:07:15.199
flinging them away. This may be why Mars is
so small, too; Jupiter robbed it of all of

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:16.650
its food as it formed.

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:21.050
While most asteroids live in the main belt,
not all of them do. Some have orbits that

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:26.470
cross that of Mars, taking them closer to the Sun.
We call those -- wait for it -- Mars-crossing

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:30.760
asteroids. Some have orbits that take them
even closer to the Sun, crossing Earth’s

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:37.160
orbit. We call those… Apollo asteroids.
Eh? Gotcha! They’re named after the asteroid

00:07:37.169 --> 00:07:39.310
Apollo, the first of its kind to be found.

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:43.850
Some have orbits that are almost entirely
inside Earth’s orbit, called Aten asteroids.

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:48.940
Aten and Apollo asteroids can get pretty close
to Earth, so we call them Near-Earth Asteroids.

00:07:48.949 --> 00:07:52.499
Now, while they get close to us, that doesn’t
mean they’ll hit us, because, for example,

00:07:52.499 --> 00:07:56.090
their orbits may be tilted, so their orbits
and the orbit of the Earth don’t actually

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:57.550
ever physically cross.

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:02.860
But… some do have paths that literally intersect
Earth’s. That doesn’t mean they’ll hit

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:06.830
us every pass, either; after all, you can
walk across a street without getting hit by

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:12.490
a car. The problem comes when you try to occupy
the same volume of space as a car at the same time.

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:17.439
Astronomers, unsurprisingly, are very concerned
about asteroids that can hit us. That’s

00:08:17.439 --> 00:08:21.870
why we have surveys, observatories scanning
the skies, looking for them. This is a pretty

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:25.349
important topic, and I’ll go into in more
depth in a future episode.

00:08:25.349 --> 00:08:29.349
There’s another category of asteroid that
exists due to a quirk of gravity. When a planet

00:08:29.349 --> 00:08:33.710
orbits a star, there are points along the
planet’s orbit and near it in space where

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:38.690
the gravitational forces are in balance. If
you place an object there, it tends to stay

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:42.099
there, like an egg in a cup. These are called
Lagrange points. One of them is along the

00:08:42.099 --> 00:08:46.290
same orbit as the planet, but 60° ahead;
another is 60° behind.

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:51.120
The first such asteroid found was orbiting
60° ahead Jupiter, and was named Achilles,

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:55.460
after the Greek hero in the Trojan war. As
more were found, the naming convention stuck;

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:59.320
asteroids ahead of Jupiter were named after
Greek figures in the Trojan war, and those

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:03.930
behind Jupiter were named for Trojans, and
now we just call them all Trojan asteroids.

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:09.120
Trojan asteroids have been spotted for Jupiter,
Mars, Uranus, Neptune, and even Earth! Earth’s

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:14.050
was found in 2010 using observations by an
orbiting observatory called WISE, which scans

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:19.459
the skies in infrared light, where asteroids
glow due to their own heat. 2010 TK7, as it’s

00:09:19.459 --> 00:09:25.259
called, is about 300 meters across and 800 million
kilometers away, orbiting the Sun ahead of the Earth.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:29.079
There are also asteroids that have orbits
that are very similar to Earth’s, but are

00:09:29.079 --> 00:09:34.079
slightly elliptical and tilted with respect
to ours. Because of this, they can stay relatively

00:09:34.079 --> 00:09:38.399
near the Earth in space, but don’t really
orbit us; instead they sometimes get closer

00:09:38.399 --> 00:09:43.059
and sometimes recede. It’s pretty weird,
but a natural outcome of orbital mechanics.

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:46.940
Some people say these asteroids are moons
of Earth, but it’s better to say they’re

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:51.110
co-orbital with us. Only a few are known,
the most famous being Cruithne, which can

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:54.130
get as close as 12 or so million kilometers
from us.

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:58.860
Oh, one more thing. Originally, asteroids
were named after female goddesses; Ceres,

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:04.780
Vesta, Juno, and so on. But as hundreds more
were found, and then thousands, we ran out

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:09.540
of names. Eventually astronomers who discovered
asteroids were allowed to name them -- through

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:13.630
a lengthy proposal and acceptance process
governed by the International Astronomical

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:16.339
Union. They also get a number assigned to
them as well.

00:10:16.339 --> 00:10:20.599
A lot of astronomers have asteroids named
after them, including astronomers who study

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:25.840
asteroids, like my friend Amy Mainzer, who
works on the WISE mission—hers is 234750

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:31.230
Amymainzer—and Eleanor Helin, who discovered
quite a few asteroids and comets. Hers is

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:33.730
3267 Glo; for her nickname.

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:37.670
And this one? It’s a one-kilometer wide
rock in the main belt, and goes by the name

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:40.510
165347 Philplait.

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:41.560
Must be coincidence.

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:45.630
Today you learned that asteroids are chunks
of rock, metal, or both that were once part

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:50.630
of smallish planets but were destroyed after
collisions. Most orbit the Sun between Mars

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:55.380
and Jupiter, but some get near the Earth.
The biggest, Ceres is far smaller than the

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:59.040
Moon but still big enough to be round and
have undergone differentiation.
