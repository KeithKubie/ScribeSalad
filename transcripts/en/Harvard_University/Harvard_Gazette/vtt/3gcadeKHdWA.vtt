00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.180
We currently have around 2,500 pigments, different
samples of pigments.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.840
And what we do is add to it every year.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.510
It's a growing collection.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:22.430
We need to do that because we're constantly
looking at newer works of art that use new

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.390
pigments, and we need to have standards for
comparisons against works so that we can identify

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.270
what the pigments are.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.940
We just recently added Vantablack.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.690
It's a very, very light-absorbing material
and, although it's described as a pigment,

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.100
it's not really a pigment because it has to
be grown on the surface.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.000
It's not a powder that's mixed with something
and applied to the aluminum.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.100
It's grown there in-situ, and it's a series
of very small tubes.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:03.490
So you have small, round tubes that grow outwards
from the surface and the light goes into those

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:13.380
tubes, bounces around, and then is transferred
to heat energy which is then dissipated.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.620
We typically have a student who works with
us over the summer, and the student will go

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.510
through and do all the research and find out
what we don't have in the collections and

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.060
then contact the pigment manufacturers and
order the pigments from them.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:35.180
They'll buy about 250 grams of pigment and
then we'll catalog that and then bring it

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.300
into the collection.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.640
If a student has a particular interest in
a pigment we can help them in their research,

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:55.750
we can show them the material, and what we
try and do is help people who have specific

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.380
interests in materials that we have in the
collection.
