00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.709
With over 100,000 condoms ordered in 2010
for the Vancouver Winter Olympics, it's obvious

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:14.750
- a little extra physical activity goes on
during the Games. But, does this sexual excitement

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.070
before competition influence an athlete's
performance?

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.860
Many ancient civilizations, including the
Greeks, believed that semen was divine and

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.530
contained a man's strength. Today, some athletes
hold the belief that sexual frustration, driven

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:32.180
by abstinence, ultimately increases aggression
- which is valuable for many sports. Testosterone,

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.789
in particular, is responsible for aggression
and sexual desire in both men and women, and

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:41.379
there has long been the belief that ejaculation
draws testosterone from the body. Muhammad

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:45.059
Ali, for example, wouldn't make love for six
weeks before a fight.

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.449
But modern science sees things differently.
In fact, many studies have shown the exact

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:54.449
opposite: testosterone increases after sex.
Go without for over 3 months, and testosterone

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.629
drops to levels near that of a child. So from
a biological perspective, sex may actually

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.639
increase performance, particularly in sports
where a bit of extra aggression could be the

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:08.480
deciding factor - like ski-cross, short track
speed skating, or of course hockey.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.750
So what about sex tiring the body out? The
honest truth is that the average sex session

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.290
only burns about 50 calories...the equivalent
of running up a few flights of stairs. On

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.520
the contrary, studies have found that sex
the night before has no noticeable effects

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.780
on strength, power, endurance, or any other
fitness variables. Though, sex has been documented

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.440
to trigger the release of pain-blockers in
the brain. These can help modulate chronic

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.500
pain, with effects lasting upwards of 24 hours.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.600
The biggest unknown lies in the psychological
effects, which is much harder to study, and

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.140
may actually play a bigger role in major competitions.
An athlete's best performance is achieved

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.190
with particular balance of alertness and anxiety.
Of course, staying up all night chasing sexual

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.830
escapades tips the scale against alertness
the next day. On the other hand, sex can be

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.240
a great stress release for nervous athletes.
While other personalities simply desire more

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.960
focus and concentration, in which case, a
good nights sleep is ideal.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.290
At the end of the day, science says: it depends
how sex affects each individual. If you need

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.400
that extra kick of testosterone, then you
might just want to get your game on - a night early.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.900
Don't forget: we have a new video out every day during the Olympics. 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.900
Can't wait? Our amazing partners at the CBC already have five of the videos up now for you to binge on.
