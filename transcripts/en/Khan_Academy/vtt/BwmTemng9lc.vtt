00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.630
Simplify 2a squared
over 3b to the fifth,

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:07.740
all of that to the fourth power.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.740
So here we can use the property
that if I have x over y,

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.630
and I'm raising that
to the nth power,

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.830
this is the same thing as
x to the nth power over y

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:19.690
to the nth power.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:21.910
And we could see that
with an example real fast.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.890
If I had, let's say I had x
over y to the third power,

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.380
what would this be equal to?

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.770
This would be x over y
times x over y times x

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.550
over y, which is going
to be equal to x times x

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.890
times x over y times y times y.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.870
And this is clearly x to the
third over y to the third.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.862
So I just gave you a particular
example of why this works.

00:00:48.862 --> 00:00:50.570
Hopefully, it gives
you enough confidence

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.270
or makes you feel good
about using this property.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.050
So let's use it right here
in our actual problem.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.410
So we have 2a squared
over 3b to the fifth,

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.580
all of that to the fourth power.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.370
So this is going to be
the same thing as 2a

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:05.704
squared to the fourth power.

00:01:05.704 --> 00:01:06.870
So let me write it this way.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.460
It's going to be 2a squared
to the fourth power.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.000
Let me do the fourth
power in blue.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:25.800
All of that over 3b to the
fifth to the fourth power.

00:01:28.802 --> 00:01:30.510
And now we can use
the property that if I

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.960
take the product of
things and raise that

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.120
to a power, that's the
same thing as raising each

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.240
of the things in the
product to the power

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.610
and then taking their product.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.193
So this is going to
be the same thing.

00:01:42.193 --> 00:01:44.190
Let me just write
the property here.

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.870
So if I have x times
y to the nth power,

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.390
this is the same thing
as x to the nth times

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.322
y to the nth power.

00:01:55.322 --> 00:01:56.780
And you could do
a similar argument

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.310
that we did right here to
see why this works out.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.640
So let's do that over here.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.020
2a squared to the fourth power
is going to be equal to 2

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.390
to the fourth power--
I'll color code

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.740
it-- 2 to the fourth power times
a squared to the fourth power.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.870
And then all of that over 3b to
the fifth to the fourth power.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:28.350
That's going to be 3 to
the fourth power times b

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.940
to the fifth to
the fourth power.

00:02:36.336 --> 00:02:38.210
Now, the last interesting
thing here-- and we

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.740
can evaluate what these
numbers come out to be.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.750
2 to the fourth power-- let
me just do it right now.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.480
2 to the fourth--
2 squared is 4.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.910
2 to the third power is 8.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.900
2 to the fourth power is 16.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.310
So this right here is 16.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.010
3 to the first power is 3.

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.570
3 squared is 9.

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.710
3 to the third power is 27.

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.370
3 to the fourth power is 81.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.620
So this over here
is-- let me do it

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.500
in that green
color-- this is 81.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.070
And to simplify
these terms here,

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.860
we just have to remember the--I
guess we call it the power

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.380
property or the power
rule of exponents.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:23.140
And that's just the notion
that if I have x to the n

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.120
and then I raise that
to the mth power,

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.676
this is the exact same thing
as x to the n times m power.

00:03:31.676 --> 00:03:33.050
So if we wanted
to simplify this,

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:39.100
our numerator is now 16--
that's the 2 to the fourth--

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.920
and then a squared and
then that the fourth power.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.460
That's going to be a
to the 2 times 4 power,

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.310
or a to the eighth power.

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.540
This is literally 2
times 4, so we're just

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.980
multiplying 2 times 4.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.250
This 2 times this
4 to get that 8.

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.130
And then in the denominator,
we have our 81 and then

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.590
b to the fifth and then
that the fourth power.

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.330
That's going to be b to
the 5 times 4 power or b

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:08.710
to the 20th power.

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.970
So I got 20 by
multiplying 5 times 4.

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.200
And we're done.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.540
This is about as
simplified as we can get.
