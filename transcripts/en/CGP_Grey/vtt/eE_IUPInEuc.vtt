00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:04.529
Welcome to the Great nation of Holland: where
the tulips grow, the windmills turn, the breakfast

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.940
is chocolatey, the people industrious, and
the sea tries to drown it all.

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.060
Except, this country isn't Holland.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:11.060
It's time for:

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.820
The Difference Between Holland, the Netherlands
(and a whole lot more)

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.320
The correct name for this tulip growing, windmill
building hagelslag eating, container ship

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.910
moving, ocean conquering nation is the Netherlands.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.680
But confusion is understandable -- the general
region been renamed a lot over a thousand

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.340
including as: The Dutch Republic, The United
States of Belgium, and The Kingdom of Hollande

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.980
But it's not just history that makes this
country's name confusing because the Netherlands

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.129
is divided into twelve provinces:

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:36.179
* Groningen
* Drenthe

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:37.239
* Overijssel
* Gelderland

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:38.489
* Limburg
* Brabant

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.730
* Zeeland (Which, by the way, is the Zeeland
that makes this Zeeland, new)

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.670
* Friesland (With adorable little hearts on
its flag)

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.359
* Flevoland
* Utrecht, and here's the confusion:

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:48.639
* Noord (North) Holland and
* Zuid (South) Holland

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:52.749
These provinces make calling the Netherlands
'Holland' like calling the United States 'Dakota'.

00:00:52.749 --> 00:00:56.350
Though unlike the Dakotas, which are mostly
empty, save for the occasional Jackalope,

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.510
the two Hollands are the most populated provinces
and have some of the biggest attractions like,

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.049
Amsterdam and Keukenhof.

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:05.920
Chances are if it's Dutch, and you've heard
of it, it's in one of the Hollands.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.780
Even the government's travel website for the
country is Holland.com -- officially because

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.140
it sounds friendlier, but unofficially it's
probably what people are actually searching

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.140
for.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.490
Confusion continues because: People who live
in the Hollands are called Hollanders, but

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.840
all citizens of the Netherlands are called
Dutch as is their language.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.289
But in Dutch they say: Nederlands sprekende
Nederlanders in Nederland which sounds like

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:29.210
they'd rather we call them Netherlanders speaking
Netherlandish.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.479
Meanwhile, next door in Germany, they're Deutsche
sprechen Deutsch in Deutschland.

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.840
Which sounds like they'd rather be called
Dutch.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.500
This linguistic confusion is why Americans
call the Pennsylvania Dutch Dutch even though

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.609
they're Germans.

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:43.399
To review: this country is the Netherlands,
its people are Dutch, they speak Dutch.

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.829
There is no country called Holland, but there
are provinces of North and South Holland.

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:48.829
Got it?

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:49.909
Great, because it's about to get more complicated.

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.789
The Netherlands is part of a Kingdom with
the same name: The Kingdom of the Netherlands

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:55.799
-- which is headed by the Dutch Royal Family.

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.229
The Kingdom of the Netherlands contains three
more countries and to find them we must sail

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.270
from the icy North Sea to the Caribbean and
Aruba, Curaçao, Sint Maarten.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.819
These are no territories, but self-governing
countries within the Kingdom of the Netherlands

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:10.030
and as such they have their own governments,
and their own currencies.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.620
Geography geek side note here:

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.830
While Aruba and Curaçao are islands, Sint
Maarten is just the Southern Half of a tiny

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.040
island also named Saint Martin the other half
of which is occupied by France and also named

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.040
Saint Martin.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.250
So despite being separated by Belgium on the
European map, The Kingdom of the Netherlands

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.350
and the French Republic share a border on
the other side of the world on an island so

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.110
nice they named it thrice.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.160
But why does the Kingdom of the Netherlands
reach to the Caribbean anyway?

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.610
Because, Empire.

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.360
In the 1600s the Dutch, always looking to
expand business, laid their hands on every

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.920
valuable port they could.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.120
For a time, America's East Coast was 'New
Netherland' with its capital city of New Amsterdam.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.290
There was New Zealand, as mentioned previously,
and nearby, the king of the islands, New Holland.

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.770
Though the empire is gone, these three Caribbean
nations remain.

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.350
And while four countries in one kingdom, isn't
unheard of, it doesn't stop there, because

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.760
the country of the Netherlands, also extends
its borders to the Caribbean and three more

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.310
islands: Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.100
These are not countries in a Kingdom, but
are cities of the Country of the Netherlands

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.480
and they look the part.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.150
Residents of these far-flung cities vote in
elections for the Dutch government just as

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.310
any Hollander would.

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.560
Though, weirdly, they don't belong to any
province and they don't use the Dutch currency

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.040
of Euros, they use Dollars instead.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.000
It's kind of like if Hawaii wasn't a state,
but technically part of the District of Columbia,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.720
all the while using the Yen.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.960
These cities of the Country of the Netherlands
and these countries in the Kingdom of the

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.490
Netherlands, are together are known as the
Dutch Caribbean.

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.310
And their citizens are Dutch citizens.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.320
Which, because the Kingdom of the Netherlands
is a member of the European Union, means these

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.630
Dutch Caribbeans are also Europeans.

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.370
So in the end, there are 6 Caribbean islands,
four countries, twelve provinces, two Hollands,

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.870
two Netherlands and one kingdom, all Dutch.
