00:00:09.898 --> 00:00:13.228
Off the rugged coast 
of the pacific northwest,

00:00:13.228 --> 00:00:17.318
pods of killer whales 
inhabit the frigid waters.

00:00:17.318 --> 00:00:19.538
Each family is able to survive here

00:00:19.538 --> 00:00:21.578
thanks mainly to one member,

00:00:21.578 --> 00:00:23.598
its most knowledgeable hunter:

00:00:23.598 --> 00:00:25.208
the grandmother.

00:00:25.208 --> 00:00:28.418
These matriarchs can live eighty years 
or more,

00:00:28.418 --> 00:00:31.508
while most males die off 
in their thirties.

00:00:31.508 --> 00:00:34.608
Though killer whales inhabit 
every major ocean,

00:00:34.608 --> 00:00:37.658
until recently we knew 
very little about them.

00:00:37.658 --> 00:00:40.518
The details of their lives 
eluded scientists

00:00:40.518 --> 00:00:44.028
until an organization called 
the Center for Whale Research

00:00:44.028 --> 00:00:46.608
began studying a single population

00:00:46.608 --> 00:00:51.378
near Washington State and 
British Columbia in 1976.

00:00:51.378 --> 00:00:52.978
Thanks to their ongoing work,

00:00:52.978 --> 00:00:55.368
we’ve learned a great deal 
about these whales,

00:00:55.368 --> 00:00:57.768
known as the Southern Residents.

00:00:57.768 --> 00:00:59.008
And the more we learn,

00:00:59.008 --> 00:01:04.388
the more this population’s elders’ 
vital role comes into focus.

00:01:04.388 --> 00:01:07.072
Each grandmother starts her life as a calf

00:01:07.072 --> 00:01:10.882
born into her mother’s family group, 
or matriline.

00:01:10.882 --> 00:01:12.942
The family does everything together,

00:01:12.942 --> 00:01:18.202
hunting and playing, even communicating 
through their own unique set of calls.

00:01:18.202 --> 00:01:23.922
Both sons and daughters spend their entire
lives with their mothers’ families.

00:01:23.922 --> 00:01:28.152
That doesn’t mean a young whale 
only interacts with her relatives.

00:01:28.152 --> 00:01:30.382
Besides their own special calls,

00:01:30.382 --> 00:01:33.912
her matriline shares a dialect 
with nearby families,

00:01:33.912 --> 00:01:35.992
and they socialize regularly.

00:01:35.992 --> 00:01:39.082
Once a female reaches age fifteen or so,

00:01:39.082 --> 00:01:43.512
these meetings become opportunities 
to mate with males from other groups.

00:01:43.512 --> 00:01:46.432
The relationships don’t go much 
beyond mating—

00:01:46.432 --> 00:01:49.032
she and her calves stay with her family,

00:01:49.032 --> 00:01:52.022
while the male returns to his own mother.

00:01:52.022 --> 00:01:54.282
Until approximately age forty,

00:01:54.282 --> 00:01:57.822
she gives birth every 6 years on average.

00:01:57.822 --> 00:02:00.292
Then, she goes through menopause—

00:02:00.292 --> 00:02:03.622
which is almost unheard of 
in the animal kingdom.

00:02:03.622 --> 00:02:07.242
In fact, humans, killer whales and 
a few other whales

00:02:07.242 --> 00:02:11.232
are the only species whose females 
continue to live for years

00:02:11.232 --> 00:02:14.002
after they stop reproducing.

00:02:14.002 --> 00:02:15.232
After menopause,

00:02:15.232 --> 00:02:18.452
grandmothers take the lead 
hunting for salmon,

00:02:18.452 --> 00:02:21.112
the Southern Residents’ main food source.

00:02:21.112 --> 00:02:23.622
Most of the winter they forage offshore,

00:02:23.622 --> 00:02:26.092
supplementing salmon with other fish.

00:02:26.092 --> 00:02:30.312
But when the salmon head 
towards shore in droves to spawn,

00:02:30.312 --> 00:02:32.612
the killer whales follow.

00:02:32.612 --> 00:02:34.752
The matriarch shows the younger whales

00:02:34.752 --> 00:02:37.882
where to find the most fertile 
fishing grounds.

00:02:37.882 --> 00:02:42.772
She also shares up to 90% of 
the salmon she catches.

00:02:42.772 --> 00:02:44.242
With each passing year,

00:02:44.242 --> 00:02:46.792
her contributions become more vital:

00:02:46.792 --> 00:02:51.872
overfishing and habitat destruction have 
decimated salmon populations,

00:02:51.872 --> 00:02:56.152
putting the whales at near-constant 
risk of starvation.

00:02:56.156 --> 00:02:58.006
These grandmothers’ expertise

00:02:58.006 --> 00:03:01.906
can mean the difference between 
life and death for their families–

00:03:01.906 --> 00:03:04.196
but why do they stop having calves?

00:03:04.196 --> 00:03:08.656
It’s almost always advantageous for a
female to continue reproducing,

00:03:08.656 --> 00:03:12.786
even if she also cares for her existing 
children and grandchildren.

00:03:12.786 --> 00:03:17.406
A couple unique circumstances 
change this equation for killer whales.

00:03:17.406 --> 00:03:20.416
The fact that neither sons or daughters

00:03:20.416 --> 00:03:23.636
leave their families of origin 
is extremely rare—

00:03:23.636 --> 00:03:26.036
in almost all animal species,

00:03:26.036 --> 00:03:28.786
one or both sexes disperse.

00:03:28.786 --> 00:03:31.926
This means that as a female 
killer whale ages,

00:03:31.926 --> 00:03:33.886
a greater percentage of her family

00:03:33.886 --> 00:03:36.596
consists of her children 
and grandchildren,

00:03:36.596 --> 00:03:39.416
while more distant relatives die off.

00:03:39.416 --> 00:03:44.126
Because older females are more closely 
related to the group than younger females,

00:03:44.126 --> 00:03:47.511
they do best to invest in the family 
as a whole,

00:03:47.511 --> 00:03:51.231
whereas younger females should 
invest in reproducing.

00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:52.911
In the killer whale’s environment,

00:03:52.911 --> 00:03:55.591
every new calf is another mouth to feed

00:03:55.591 --> 00:03:58.301
on limited, shared resources.

00:03:58.301 --> 00:04:02.581
An older female can further her genes
without burdening her family

00:04:02.581 --> 00:04:04.761
by supporting her adult sons,

00:04:04.761 --> 00:04:07.801
who sire calves other families will raise.

00:04:07.801 --> 00:04:10.231
This might be why the females have evolved

00:04:10.231 --> 00:04:14.321
to stop reproducing entirely 
in middle age.

00:04:14.321 --> 00:04:16.802
Even with the grandmothers’ contributions,

00:04:16.802 --> 00:04:20.202
the Southern Resident killer whales 
are critically endangered,

00:04:20.202 --> 00:04:23.052
largely due to a decline in salmon.

00:04:23.052 --> 00:04:26.562
We urgently need to invest in restoring 
salmon populations

00:04:26.562 --> 00:04:28.442
to save them from extinction.

00:04:28.442 --> 00:04:32.742
In the long term, we’ll need more studies 
like the Center for Whale Research’s.

00:04:32.742 --> 00:04:34.982
What we’ve learned about 
the Southern Residents

00:04:34.982 --> 00:04:37.172
may not hold true for other groups.

00:04:37.172 --> 00:04:39.612
By studying other populations closely,

00:04:39.612 --> 00:04:42.602
we might uncover more 
startling adaptations,

00:04:42.196 --> 00:04:46.156
and anticipate their vulnerabilities 
to human interference

00:04:46.156 --> 00:04:49.306
before their survival is at risk.
