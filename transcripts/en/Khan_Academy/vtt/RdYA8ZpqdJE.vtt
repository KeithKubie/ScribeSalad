00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.510
Solve the equation, 5 over
2x minus 4 over 3x is

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:06.880
equal to 7 over 18.

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.720
And they tell us that x can't to
be equal to 0, because that

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.000
would make these two expressions
here undefined.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.265
Hopefully the answer here is not
0, and then this becomes--

00:00:15.265 --> 00:00:17.970
this is kind of extra,
unnecessary information.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.990
So let's figure out
how to solve this.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.970
So a good place to start-- I
don't like having x's in my

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:23.950
denominators.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.450
So let's multiply-- and in fact,
in general, I don't like

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:27.785
having fractions in
my equations.

00:00:27.785 --> 00:00:30.330
So let's see if we can multiply
both sides of this

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.920
equation by some things that
will get rid of the fractions.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.450
So let me just rewrite it
so we have some space.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:41.200
5 over 2x, and then we have
minus 4 over 3x is

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.580
equal to 7 over 18.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.990
Now, if we want to get rid of
the 2 in the denominator here,

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.450
we could multiply
everything by 2.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.900
If we want to get rid of this 3
in the denominator, we could

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.380
multiply everything by 3.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.570
If we want to get rid of this
18 in the denominator, we

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.980
could multiply everything
by 18.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.960
And 18 also includes
a 2 and a 3.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.850
The prime factorization
of 18 is 2 times 9,

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.200
which is 3 times 3.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.360
So when you're multiplying both
sides of the equation by

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.740
18, you're actually multiplying
it by a 2 and a 3

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.230
and another 3.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:24.410
So let's just multiply both
sides of this equation by 18.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.150
So I'll multiply this term
right here by 18.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.600
And then, this term
right here by 18.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.850
That'll get rid of all of
these numbers in the

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:33.960
denominator.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.700
18 divided by 3 is 6.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.410
18 divided by 2 is 9.

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.360
But we don't just have numbers
in the denominator, we also

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.020
have these x's in
the denominator.

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.120
So let's also multiply both
sides of the equation by x, so

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.510
that we get rid of these.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.400
So we're essentially going to
multiply both sides of the

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.390
equation by 18x.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.870
We're taking, essentially,
the least common multiple

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.430
of 2x, 3x and 18.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.490
This is the smallest number that
is divisible by all three

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.610
of these characters.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.012
Now, when we do that our
denominators will disappear.

00:02:04.012 --> 00:02:06.350
x divided by x is 1.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.490
18 divided by 2 is 9.

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.390
So this term becomes 9
times 5, which is 45.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.690
And then this term right here,
x divided by x is 1.

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.660
18 divided by 3 is 6.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.890
So you have 6 times 4 is 24,
but you have a subtraction

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.770
sign here so minus 24 is equal
to-- let me do that in that

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.470
yellow-- is equal to-- and then
you have this term, 7

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.310
over 18 times 18x.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.010
Well, the 18's cancel out and
you're just left with 7 times

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.810
x is equal to 7x.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.150
And now this becomes a much,
much simpler equation.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.980
Now, what's 45 minus 24?

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.430
Let's see, 45 minus 20
would be would be 25.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.435
Then you subtract
4 more, it's 21.

00:02:54.435 --> 00:02:58.580
So you get 21 is equal to 7x.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.786
Divide both sides by 7 and
you get x is equal to 3.

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.070
And let's verify that
that works.

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.410
So we have 5 over 2x.

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.190
So that's the same thing as
5 over 2 times 3, minus 4

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.670
over 3 times 3.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:28.620
So this is 5/6 minus 4 over
18-- sorry, 4 over 9.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.410
We want to find a common
denominator.

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.900
18 is the least common multiple
of 6 and 9, so let's

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.070
put it over 18.

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.510
5/6 is the same thing
as 15 over 18.

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.950
Multiply the numerator
and denominator by 3.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.130
4/9 is the same thing
as 8 over 18.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.030
Multiply the numerator
and denominator by 2.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.230
15 minus 8.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.260
So this becomes 15 minus
8 over 18, which is

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.820
equal to 7 over 18.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:57.690
So it works out.

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.190
5 over 2x when x is equal to 3,
minus 4 over 3x when x is

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.150
equal to 3 is indeed
equal to 7/18.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.690
So we're done.
