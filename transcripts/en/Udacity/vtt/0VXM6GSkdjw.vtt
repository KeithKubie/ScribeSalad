00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.570
So how can we deal with the case where either v or u already has an assignment?

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:06.700
Do we have to modify the search tree for that?

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.740
Do we have to initiate a brute force search in that case?

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.980
Or is it the case that we do not need to worry at all

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.140
because it's actually quite obvious what to do with those vertices?

00:00:17.140 --> 99:59:59.000
Please select whichever you think is correct.
