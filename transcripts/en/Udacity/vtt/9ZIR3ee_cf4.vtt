00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.708
As the population of pandas in the preserve grows, there'll be more and more

00:00:03.708 --> 00:00:08.700
pandas born each year, that's this third choice. This makes sense. The more

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.261
pandas there are, the more there will be to have baby pandas. Then, when those

00:00:13.261 --> 00:00:17.854
babies grow up, there'll be even more pandas to have even more babies. That

00:00:17.854 --> 00:00:22.610
explains why this curve is getting steeper and steeper as time goes on.
