00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.510
IntroWhen it comes to Disney movies, people
usually fall into two groups: those who think

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:16.059
that the studio releases nothing but family-friendly
adventures and important lessons, and those

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:21.590
who see suspicious jokes, messages, or meanings
below the surface. The studio will never confirm

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.210
or deny just how many outlandish fan theories
actually do have some truth to them, but the

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.260
ideas alone are worth investigating. Here
are Screen Rant's 10 Movie Theories That Completely

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.780
Change Disney Films.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:36.780
Toy Story

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.154
Most of the series is spent following the
toys of Toy Story, but their owner, Andy,

00:00:38.154 --> 00:00:39.154
is just as important. But the adventures he
shares with his childhood toys - and the need

00:00:39.154 --> 00:00:40.154
to give them up as he gets older - may run
in his family. In Toy Story 2, fans found

00:00:40.154 --> 00:00:44.590
out that Jessie was originally owned by a
girl named Emily, before she was given away.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.840
But some fans have claimed that Pixar makes
it perfectly clear that Emily is really Andy's

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.960
mom. In the first story, Andy is playing with
Woody while wearing Jessie's hat - the same

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.900
one Emily played with when she was younger.
Since 30 years have passed since Emily gave

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.180
her up, it makes Andy's mom the right age,
and delivers a happy ending to Jessie's story

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.260
that fans never even noticed.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.810
Belle &amp; Jane

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.689
It's obvious that the leading ladies of Beauty
&amp; The Beast and Tarzan have plenty in common:

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.350
their hair, fair features, love of the color
yellow, and a knack for taming wild men. But

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.531
what if those similarities aren't just coincidence?
When the gorillas are trashing Jane and her

00:01:22.531 --> 00:01:26.850
father's camp, the teapot set from Beauty
&amp; The Beast is visible - the one that Mrs.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.080
Potts and Chip were cursed to remain until
The Beast was loved. So, did Jane bring a

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.170
French relative's china on her trip? Or is
it all from a shared family set? The time

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.170
periods align, since the Eiffel Tower in Beauty
&amp; The Beast proves the movie is more modern

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.380
than you would think. If it isn't, could Jane
be the grand daughter of Belle and the Beast?

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.049
We'll let the fans decide.

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:42.049
Aladdin

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:43.439
The tale of a prince in diguise and magical
wishes is narrated by Genie, but what if the

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.799
story isn't set in Agrabah centuries in the
past? What if it's actually set thousands

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:52.970
of years&nbsp;in the future? When he's first released,
Genie claims that he's been imprisoned in

00:01:52.970 --> 00:02:01.399
the lamp for thousands of years. So how does
he know to make jokes about modern movies

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:06.660
and celebrities? Believe it or not, some fans
believe Genie was trapped in our time, and

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.560
waited ten thousand years, as the world advanced,
and a world-ending disaster set mankind back

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.220
by millennia. It's a wild theory, and there's
no evidence, right? Well, the modern stop

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.030
signs buried in the sand of the companion
video game might actually back this theory

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.700
up…

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.170
Brave Boo

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.420
There's no character more adorable than Boo,
the little girl who refused to be scared by

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.690
the stars of Monsters, Inc. And even though
she wound up back at home in the end, leaving

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.330
her best friend behind cut deep. So what if
she refused to give up looking for him as

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.250
she got older? One fan theory asks if the
teleporting-door technology used in Monsters,

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.280
Inc isn't just moving monsters through space
- but time, as well. How Boo figured it out

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.090
is a mystery, but the theory claims that she
picked up plenty of magic along the way, eventually

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.760
landing in the forest of Brave. There she
grew old, carving pictures of Sully and the

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.370
Pizza Planet truck. When Merrida comes to
ask for help, she escapes the only way she

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.070
knows how: by traveling across time and space
using a simple door.

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.990
Up, Up, And Away

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.570
No Pixar fan will forget the opening scenes
of Up, following Carl Fredericksen fall in

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:22.850
love, grow old, and eventually lose his wife.
Living alone, it's only a matter of time until

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.590
Carl's temper gets him committed. But instead,
he escapes to see the world using thousands

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:33.330
of balloons tied to his house. Or does he?
It's too sad to believe, but some fans think

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.400
Carl actually died the night before he was
headed to Shady Oaks, and the adventure is

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.230
his journey to the afterlife. We don't know
if that's an even more poetic look at the

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.940
movie, or just doubling down on the tears.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:47.940
Wreck-it Ralph

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.220
As entertaining as the classic game characters
may be, it was Calhoun from Hero's Duty who

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.220
stole the show. And she came with a tragic
backstory, too: seeing the man of her dreams

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.760
eaten by a Cy-bug just seconds before they
would have been married. She's still a soldier,

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.730
and took her anger out on the bug right then
and there. But wait - Cy-bugs&nbsp;become&nbsp;the

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.010
things they eat: whether it's a gun, candy,
or an actual person. It didn't take long for

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:15.130
fans to realize that the Cy-bug that killed
Calhoun's fiance actually&nbsp;became him&nbsp;seconds

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.660
later - forcing her to kill the twisted, insectoid
murderer version of him. And that puts a completely

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.840
different spin on the rest of her story - not
to mention a more satisfying ending.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.090
Snow White Gets Tangled?

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.620
The Evil Queen's name says it all in Disney's
classic Snow White, when her need to be the

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.751
most beautiful woman in her kingdom leads
her up against the lovely Snow White. She

00:04:36.751 --> 00:04:42.180
takes the form of an ugly old woman, and sets
out to deceive the girl with false promises.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.650
Once Disney fans realized that the Evil Queen
actually looks a lot like Gothel from Tangled,

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.620
they also noticed that they're both obsessed
with staying young and beautiful, and taking

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.690
advantage of young girls to make it happen.
So what if they're the same woman? Having

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:00.250
failed to get the job done with one Disney
princess, the Queen just moved onto the next?

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.980
It's not as exciting a theory as some, but
helps link Disney's oldest movie to one of

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:10.160
its most recent hits.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.250
Toy Story 3

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.310
Out of all the Disney theories, people claiming
that Toy Story 3 is just one massive analogy

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:22.100
for the Nazi's treatment of Jewish citizens
seems hard to believe. But even if the movie

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:27.910
isn't as clear a reference as some fans claim,
the actual plot is hard to ignore. First,

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:31.900
the toys are abandoned by their guardians,
then gathered up and sent to a horrible place

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.440
where they're regularly abused, and eventually
wind up inches away from death - before allies

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.710
from a faraway land show up to literally pull
them out of the fire. They even end up at

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:45.030
a new home, where toys like them are protected.
That may just be a universal story lived through

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:49.340
by all kinds of people throughout history,
but given the parallels, this theory isn't

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:53.810
going away any time soon.

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.350
The Lion King

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:59.620
When the Lion King was released, some people
started pointing out that the similarities

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:03.960
with a popular Shakespeare story were too
obvious. The Lion King would basically be

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.460
“Hamlet” with animals. If we look at the
details, this theory starts making a lot of

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:14.040
sense. In Hamlet, the King is killed by Claudius,
Hamlet’s uncle, but the circumstances of

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:19.300
his death are kept secret. Hamlet has two
goofy friends named Rosencrantz and Guildenstern

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:23.220
and ends up getting revenge for his father’s
death by stabbing his uncle and forcing him

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:28.120
to drink poisonous wine. Even if it’s heavily
influenced by the play, The Lion King remains

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.940
one of the best animated films in history.

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.550
The Frozen Theory

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:35.930
Frozen is one of the most celebrated Disney
films of the last 10 years and it’s filled

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.680
with references from other Disney movies.
You probably heard about this one before since

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.970
we covered it in detail in our documentary
entitled “The Secret Relations Between Disney

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:46.110
Movie Princesses”, but it’s worth mentioning
again. The theory explores how Anna &amp; Elsa

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:51.270
might be related to Rapunzel, Cinderella and
Ariel to name a few, but the bombshell comes

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:55.570
when there is a possible link to another Disney
character… When Anna and Elsa’s parents

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:59.710
leave on their ship and never come back, the
creators of Frozen gave people a clue when

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:03.580
they said on Reddit that the parents shipwreck
on an island and have a child that ends up

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:10.440
getting raised by gorillas… Tarzan, making
him Anna &amp; Elsa’s long lost brother... Make

00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:15.620
theory!

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:19.270
Those are some of our favorite theories about
the real meaning of hit Disney movies, but

which ones have we missed? Let us know in
