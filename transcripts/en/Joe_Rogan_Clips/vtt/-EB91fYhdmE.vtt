WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.220
The Joe Rogan experience.
Okay.
I always wondered about that.
Um,

2
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.010
the catch a Predator show.
Yeah.
Why the fuck would they sign for it?

3
00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.500
They have to sign a release.
Do they?
Yes.
Or cops.

4
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.560
They have to sign a release that you have to sign a release.
So yeah.

5
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.730
And then there's like the,
is it entrapment even,
you know,

6
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.200
there was that whole thing too.
Well that show's definitely entrapment.
Yeah,

7
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.650
but it's entrapment.
I support.
Yeah,
totally.
I support and treatment.
If it's like,

8
00:00:28.651 --> 00:00:32.370
yeah,
Hey,
do you want to fuck a six year old?
And they're like,
Yo,
do okay.

9
00:00:32.371 --> 00:00:35.400
Get in the cage fucking piece of shit.
That's right.
Yeah.

10
00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:39.720
This is certainty trapping them the for you in the fucking,

11
00:00:39.721 --> 00:00:44.400
anybody under 18,
right?
Or,
yeah,
I have.
Do they get away with that?

12
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.670
How do they get to show it in their face?
Maybe because it,

13
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.230
they were proven guilty.
You waived your rights,
but just by being guilty,

14
00:00:52.231 --> 00:00:55.060
you have no rights when your fellow.
Right.
Thank you.

15
00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.500
Andrew Sandlin you have no rights.
Is that right?
Well,
you have rights.

16
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.800
Bernie Sanders wants you to be able to vote,
even if you're a terrorist.

17
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.910
If you've seen that,
he's like,
yeah,
anybody in jail for anything?
He's was like,

18
00:01:05.911 --> 00:01:09.270
you should still be able to vote.
I'm like,
Ooh.
Okay.
Okay.
I don't know.

19
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.830
It's a lot of people in jail.
That's true.

20
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.370
What if they count as residents of the state?

21
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.030
Like what have you have like a maximum security prison somewhere.
Right.

22
00:01:18.031 --> 00:01:22.160
And these prisoners have everything too,
like they have all day,
right?
Yeah.

23
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.590
You know what I need to do?
And they register to vote while they're in there.

24
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.860
If you have a few hundred thousand prisoners.
Yeah.

25
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.280
You literally can shift an election one way or the other.
That's true.

26
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.830
All you don't have to do is get into that prison and go,
hey guys,

27
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.750
here's the deal.
Um,
I'm,
I'm for shortening your fucking sentences.
Okay?
Yeah.

28
00:01:39.751 --> 00:01:42.870
I'm forgetting you better lawyers.
People would start campaigning and prisons.

29
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.140
That's legit,
man.
Yeah.
These laws were bullshit.

30
00:01:46.141 --> 00:01:50.430
And you can bribe him real easy with the little ketchup,
cigarettes,
cigarettes,

31
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.810
bringing cigarettes.
Can you just trucking cartons of cigarettes?

32
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.150
How do you win this election?
Marlboro reds.
What's that guy's name?
Booted.

33
00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.390
Judge a judge.
What's his name?
How do you say his name?
Telsey.

34
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.100
Gabbers my girl.
I'm voting for her.
I decided I liked her.

35
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.130
I met her in person cause I don't know.
I give up,
I give up.

36
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.100
I'm not even paying attention to anything else.
Tell scabbard uh,

37
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.050
but um,
if you could go into a prison,
like what is a,

38
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.630
what's a B?
What's a giant prison population?
What's big biggest one?

39
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.820
Well,
no,
we think the biggest one is biggest one.
Uh,
I don't know,

40
00:02:25.821 --> 00:02:28.800
but to be in New York,
California,
there was that,
what a,

41
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.420
isn't there a giant one in Colorado that Joey was talks about?

42
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.260
They take the serial killers,
they stuff them on the ground,
isn't there?
Um,

43
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.580
what is the,
what's the biggest one?
Uh,
take 50,004.
He looks at it.
Okay.

44
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.120
Did you say 50,000 prisoners?
Yeah.
I don't know much about that.

45
00:02:45.121 --> 00:02:48.990
That's probably a lot of people think about it around spread football arena,

46
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.970
right?
Yeah,
it's all that's true.
Okay.
Well No.
Okay.
50 to 60,000.

47
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.650
The biggest one?
The biggest?
Yeah.
What's the smile?
It's one of,

48
00:02:58.651 --> 00:03:03.160
it's probably some eldest rinky dinky.
Yeah.
But I bet I'm gonna stay in jail.

49
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.970
No.
Yeah,
I'm gonna say a little lighter.
I'm going to say 30,000.

50
00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.480
Dirham say 30,000.
The biggest or they put money on this.

51
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.180
I'll put a dollar on this.
I don't give a fuck bro.

52
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.420
I put I'll bet Ya Heineken double zero shit.

53
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.170
Now that we've got to raise from my blood,
what do we got?

54
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.210
Jimmy's confused.

55
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.170
I have to be very specific about what I look up to find this answer.

56
00:03:26.171 --> 00:03:30.400
So do you want largest maximum security?
Sure.
Yeah.
Killers.

57
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.390
Not People who smoke weed,
uh,
known as Alcatraz of the south.

58
00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.610
The Louisiana state penitentiary would go,

59
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.660
has an inmate population of 5,000.
That's it.

60
00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.790
That's maximum security.
So like criminals,

61
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.820
if you go a little bit less than it might be a little bit higher,
but okay,

62
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:50.830
let's go with thieves.

63
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.910
Let's go with medium security or maximum is like violent crimes.

64
00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.640
Biggest prison.
Yeah,
the biggest prison.
The largest prison.

65
00:04:00.641 --> 00:04:01.540
That's the thing that popped up.

66
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.060
And that's a luxury before way off 5,000 people.
It looks bigger.

67
00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.840
ADX and Florence,
the supermax prison,
if there's one old supermax prison,

68
00:04:10.841 --> 00:04:13.480
that's the one I think you're talking about,
that's even higher.

69
00:04:13.481 --> 00:04:16.480
But that would probably have way less people trying to see if it says,
oh,

70
00:04:16.481 --> 00:04:18.670
that's even higher criminal level.
Yeah.

71
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.810
That was like where they put the ice 23 hours a day talking about single cell

72
00:04:22.811 --> 00:04:25.120
confinement.
Um,

73
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.380
5,000 is a lot of people can find me this so weird cause like where'd you were

74
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.280
killing you?
But we're just killing you with nature.

75
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.830
We're going to kill you with old age and shitty nutrition.

76
00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.850
You just can keep you in a box with your own brain.
No.
Weird.
Yeah.
It's like,

77
00:04:39.851 --> 00:04:44.851
it might be more cruel to put someone into a small cage for 23 hours a day then

78
00:04:45.371 --> 00:04:50.170
this to just kill them.
I think so.
Yeah.
If you just kill you,
it's over with.
Yeah.

79
00:04:50.171 --> 00:04:54.400
You're still suffering.
Yeah.
Hundred percent.
Yeah.
100%.

80
00:04:54.401 --> 00:04:58.930
Like that was,
uh,
my,
my take on,
uh,
Chelsea Manning,

81
00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.520
who's now free.
Yeah.
Like they tortured her.
They tortured.
They did?
Yeah.

82
00:05:03.521 --> 00:05:08.110
She was naked in the cage by herself for years.

83
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.980
I think it was like the,
the whole,
she was in solitary.

84
00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.470
We'll have to find this out once Jamie's tell him with this search,

85
00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.850
I'm like looking around.
There's a,

86
00:05:15.851 --> 00:05:18.100
the one that California's male only where Manson is,

87
00:05:18.101 --> 00:05:22.750
it's got 3,500 there's one in Illinois,
medium security.
It's got a thousand.

88
00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.830
Okay,
so wait,
we're way off by a factor of,

89
00:05:26.831 --> 00:05:30.470
you're so pessimistic thought it was going low and I was off by a factor of 10 I

90
00:05:30.471 --> 00:05:32.650
don't know if this is counting then through those private ones,

91
00:05:32.651 --> 00:05:34.450
and I don't know if I can get the numbers on private,

92
00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.990
those dirty bastards stuff and then on top of each other,
it makes sense.

93
00:05:37.991 --> 00:05:42.670
If there were 30,000 inmates in one place,
a man,

94
00:05:42.671 --> 00:05:45.250
it would be hard to contain that and control that.
Yeah.

95
00:05:45.251 --> 00:05:48.730
What's the largest private prison?
See if that's

96
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.510
<v 1>okay.</v>
