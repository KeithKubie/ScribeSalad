00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.540
This episode of Crash Course Physics
is sponsored by Audible.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.100
If you watched our episode on Newton’s laws
of motion,

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.490
then you’re practically an expert on FORCES,
and the way they make things accelerate.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.610
But there’s something we left out --
something important when you’re trying to

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.930
describe how things move in real life:
FRICTION.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.610
It stops a baseball player sliding into home plate.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.770
And it’s the reason I can pick up this cup without it slipping through my fingers.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.600
Without friction, it would be tough to do
… almost anything.

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.400
But it also makes doing OTHER things…pretty
hard.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.860
Anyone who has moved furniture knows that.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.830
Luckily, friction is also a force, so, as
physicists, we know what to do with it.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:48.730
[Theme Music]

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:55.010
You’re moving into a new house, and you ask a friend to come help out, which he does, because he’s just nice like that.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.210
And you really do need his help, because you’ll
have to move giant bookcases and a desk,

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.070
and you can’t do all of that on your own.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.800
And about halfway through the move-in, you’re rearranging the furniture in your new bedroom

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.640
when you run into a problem:

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.180
You’re pushing and pushing on your bookcase,
but it just not sliding across the floor.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:17.000
So you call your friend over from the other room, and with both of you pushing, the bookcase finally starts to slide.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.720
But it was really hard to get it moving -- and
stay moving -- because there’s a force working

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.380
against you - stopping the bookcase from sliding:
friction.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.500
And there are actually two kinds of friction.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.940
First, there’s KINETIC friction -- that’s
the force that slows the bookcase down as it slides.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.820
And there’s also STATIC friction — the force you had to overcome to get it moving in the first place.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.790
So let’s talk about kinetic friction first.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.210
It’s a resistive force, which just means
that no matter what, it’ll act to resist you.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.530
In other words, if you push the bookcase so
it slides to the left, then the force of kinetic

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.299
friction is acting to the right.

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:53.299
But if you move the bookcase to the right,
then the friction will resist to the left.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.660
Kinetic friction will also often generate
heat or sound or both.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:58.980
So, what causes it?

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.549
The bookcase and the wood floor might LOOK
smooth, but if you looked at their surfaces

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.840
under a microscope, you’d see that they’re
covered in tiny bumps and grooves.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.259
As the bookcase slides across the floor, the
surfaces catch on each other,

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.859
and might even start to form weak intermolecular
bonds. That pulls on the bookcase, slowing it down.

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:21.099
But as the bookcase continues to slide, it breaks those bonds and moves past whatever bumps it was stuck on.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.740
The newly-freed molecules start to spring back,
and the movement produces heat and sound.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.480
Then the cycle continues with
the next patch of floor.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.159
You end up with a force that resists any kind
of sliding movement, and its strength depends

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:36.079
partly on what materials are sliding against
each other.

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:40.309
Rougher materials have more surfaces to catch
on each other, which is why the bookcase will

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:44.009
be easier to slide on the wood floor than
if you’d tried it on carpet.

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:48.840
And the way in which this roughness affects kinetic friction is called the coefficient of kinetic friction,

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.980
and it’s different for pretty much every
combination of materials.

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.329
But there’s another factor at work in friction:

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:59.280
How hard the materials are pressed together puts more of their surfaces in contact with each other.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.180
And that’s where the normal force, or F_N,
comes in.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.799
You might remember from our last episode,
that when a force pushes a bookcase against

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.800
the floor, the floor pushes right back.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.020
That’s Newton’s third law, and we call the force from the floor on the bookcase the NORMAL FORCE.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.600
In this case, the force from the bookcase
on the floor is just its weight, mg.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.680
So the normal force would be equal to mg,
but pointing up -- equal and opposite.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.359
So - Now we know about the two main factors
that affect the strength of kinetic friction:

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:33.899
the coefficient of kinetic friction -- written
as mu_k -- and the normal force, F_N.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.440
It shouldn’t be too surprising, then, that
the equation for kinetic friction is just…

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:39.519
the coefficient times the normal force.

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.739
But that’s only half the picture.
What about static friction?

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.800
When you weren’t able to move the bookcase
to begin with, that was because of the static

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:48.929
friction between the bookcase and the floor.

00:03:48.929 --> 00:03:52.049
Like kinetic friction, it’s also a resistive force.

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:55.929
But not only can its direction change
-- its strength can, too.

00:03:55.929 --> 00:03:59.440
Say you push on the bookcase lightly, with
just one hand, and it doesn’t move.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.280
Since it doesn’t have any acceleration,
the bookcase must be in equilibrium --

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.500
meaning that the forces on it balance out.

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.290
So the force from static friction must be
exactly equal to the force from your hand,

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.400
but in the opposite direction -- because of
that equilibrium.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.560
It’s not the same as the normal force, and
it has nothing to do with Newton’s third law.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.260
But say you really put your back into it,
pushing as hard as you can.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:28.160
The bookcase still doesn’t move, so static friction must still be pushing back with the same amount of force you are.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.220
However, the static friction between two objects
can change:

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.990
Once your friend starts pushing too, the bookcase
starts to slide, because the force from your

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.030
teamwork is greater than the maximum amount
of static friction -- which we write like this.

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.280
And the relationship between the maximum static
friction and the normal force is similar to

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.070
the relationship between kinetic friction
and the normal force.

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:54.090
There’s even a coefficient of static friction,
which measures the roughness between any two

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.180
objects -- and we just write it as mu_s.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:03.200
And the maximum force of static friction is just equal to the coefficient of static friction times the normal force.

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.050
So now we know the equations for both
kinds of friction and where they come from.

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.700
Which means we can use that information to figure
out how to solve problems involving friction.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:16.420
Just like with the other force-related
problems, we start with a free body diagram.

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:21.020
That helps sort out what’s pushing where,
so we can get an overview of the situation.

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.390
Next, we decide on some axes: where are x
and y? And which way is positive?

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:29.820
That’ll be useful when ramps come up, because
if we want, we can just decide that x points

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.430
down the ramp and y points straight into it.

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:37.160
The next thing we’ll need to do is separate
vectors into components along our new x and y axis

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:42.940
because strange things happen to the normal force when you have something (like that bookcase) sitting on a ramp.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.940
The normal force is pointing out of the ramp,
because it’s perpendicular to the surface,

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.680
but it’s NOT equal and opposite to the force
of gravity, because THAT'S pointing straight down.

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.550
Instead, we’ll have to use trigonometry
to separate the force of gravity into two

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:00.850
perpendicular components: one pointing down
along the ramp, and one pointing into it.

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:04.400
Then, the normal force will just be equal
and opposite to the part of the gravitational

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.170
force that’s pointing into the ramp.

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:09.240
So, here’s how to separate and diagram everything
that’s going on:

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.720
The angle between the force of gravity and the
component pointing into the ramp is called theta.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.200
And it’s the same as the incline
of the ramp.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:20.280
Those make two sides of a right triangle.
And since the component pointing into the

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:25.980
ramp is adjacent to the angle, we know that it’s equal to
(mg) x (the cosine of that angle)

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.490
-- and so is the normal force.

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:31.110
The other component, pointing ALONGSIDE the
ramp, is OPPOSITE the angle.

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:36.730
So, again using trigonometry, we know that
it’s equal to (mg) x (the sine of the angle).

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:41.360
So! You’ve drawn your free-body diagram,
you’ve decided on axes, and separated the

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.260
force of gravity into two useful components.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.850
Now, we can finally set up our equations!
That’s where Newton’s second law --

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:50.210
F(net) = ma -- comes in handy.

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:54.750
There’ll actually be two of these -- one
for the x direction, down the ramp, and one

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:56.570
for the y direction, into the ramp.

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:59.740
So let’s say you’ve got the bookcase where
it needs to go, and now you’re ready to

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:06.580
get something else out of the moving van -- this time, a 40-kilogram box with a very fragile vase inside it.

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.889
It’s heavy, so let’s say you put it down
on the ramp leading from the back of the truck

00:07:09.889 --> 00:07:15.789
to the ground -- which happens to be angled at 30 degrees -- and then walk away to get a drink of water.

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:21.820
You also happen to know that the coefficient of static friction between the box and the ramp is 0.50.

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:23.530
What is the box’s acceleration?

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:28.140
If it’s zero, it’ll stay put and your
vase should be okay when you walk away from it.

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:33.080
If not, that means the box will start sliding down the ramp, and you may have a problem.

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:36.840
The first thing we need to do is draw a free-body diagram of this box.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:41.400
For our coordinate system, we’ll have x along the ramp, with the positive side at the bottom,

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:46.720
and y perpendicular to the surface of the ramp,
with the positive side also toward the bottom.

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:48.600
And we have a whole bunch of forces here:

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.590
The normal force is pointing out of the ramp.

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:54.710
There’s also the force of static friction,
which, right now is pointing up the ramp -

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:58.700
since it’s resisting the part of the
gravitational force pulling the box down.

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:01.900
Speaking of which: the force of gravity is
pointing straight down --

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:06.560
NOT along either of our axes, so we
separate it into components:

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:12.460
(mg)(cos)(theta) pointing into the ramp, and
(mg)(sin)(theta) pointing down along the ramp.

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:15.210
Now we set up our net force equations along
each axis:

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:18.790
The box isn’t going anywhere along the y
axis -- nothing’s going to make it start

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:20.810
rising above the surface of the ramp, right?

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:26.340
So we know that all the forces acting along the y axis should add up to zero, since they’re all balanced out.

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:30.190
But the forces along the x axis, along the
ramp, are a different story.

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:36.780
If the box has no acceleration (it’s standing still, or moving at a constant velocity) they’ll also add up to zero.

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:41.760
But if it DOES have acceleration along the ramp, then the forces will add up to its mass, times that acceleration.

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:47.040
So, to figure out if the box slides, all we need to do is find out if the part of the gravitational force

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:52.920
pushing it down the ramp, (mg)(sin)(theta),
is greater than the maximum static friction resisting it.

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:58.439
In other words: if down the ramp is the positive
direction, is the net force positive or zero?

00:08:58.439 --> 00:09:03.579
The forces here are the gravitational force
pushing the box down the ramp, (mg)(sin)(theta),

00:09:03.579 --> 00:09:08.620
and the maximum static friction. But we write
the maximum static friction as negative, because

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:12.389
it’s pointing in the negative direction
on our x-axis -- up the ramp.

00:09:12.389 --> 00:09:14.689
So, adding them together, we get this equation.

00:09:14.689 --> 00:09:18.289
Multiplying together the different values
that make up (mg)(sin)(theta),

00:09:18.289 --> 00:09:22.180
we find that it’s equal to 196.20 Newtons.

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:26.660
And the maximum static friction is just equal
to the coefficient of (static friction) x

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:33.589
(the normal force) -- so, plugging in the
numbers, we find that it’s 169.91 Newtons.

00:09:33.589 --> 00:09:37.100
Which means that the net force is 26.29 Newtons.

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:41.820
So, yes, there’s a net force pushing the
box down the ramp, and it’s going to slide.

00:09:41.829 --> 00:09:44.489
Which means I have some bad news for you about
that vase...

00:09:44.489 --> 00:09:46.920
But today, you learned about the two types
of friction:

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:51.379
kinetic friction and static friction,
and how they act to resist applied forces.

00:09:51.379 --> 00:09:55.309
We also talked about how to use friction to
describe an object’s motion,

00:09:55.309 --> 00:09:59.069
including how to calculate the normal force
when that object’s on a ramp.

00:09:59.069 --> 00:10:02.579
Finally, we calculated whether a box on a
ramp would start sliding down.
