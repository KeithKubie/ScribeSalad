you think about what's the worst day of

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:12.830
you think about what's the worst day of
 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:14.920
you think about what's the worst day of
the year for you often the worst day of

the year is when you have to write that

the year is when you have to write that

extra check to the IRS and of course
 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.650

it's partly we hate it just because we

it's partly we hate it just because we
 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.210
it's partly we hate it just because we
have to give money away that we wish we

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.220
have to give money away that we wish we
 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.680
have to give money away that we wish we
could keep but we thought there might be

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:23.690
could keep but we thought there might be
 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.750
could keep but we thought there might be
some other underlying psychology going

some other underlying psychology going
 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.090
some other underlying psychology going
on for why we hate paying taxes so much

what happens with it I mean you know

to know when we do something what's

to know when we do something what's
 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.139
to know when we do something what's
going to happen as a result and so what

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149
going to happen as a result and so what
 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:57.610

your taxes you write in the amount and

your taxes you write in the amount and
 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.590
your taxes you write in the amount and
then you can allocate where you want

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600
then you can allocate where you want
 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.330
then you can allocate where you want
