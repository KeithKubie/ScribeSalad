00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:32.301
Recall that yesterday we saw,
no, two days ago we learned

00:00:32.301 --> 00:00:37.810
about the curl of a vector field
in space.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:45.235
And we said the curl of F is
defined by taking a cross

00:00:45.235 --> 00:00:52.380
product between the symbol dell
and the vector F.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:58.362
Concretely, the way we would
compute this would be by putting

00:00:58.362 --> 00:01:04.145
the components of F into this
determinant and expanding and

00:01:04.145 --> 00:01:09.630
then getting a vector with
components Ry minus Qz,

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:21.080
Pz minus Rx and Qx minus Py.
I think I also tried to explain

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.459
very quickly what the
significance of a curl is.

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:28.690
Just to tell you again very
quickly,

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:34.811
basically curl measures, 
if you mention that your vector

00:01:34.811 --> 00:01:40.788
field measures the velocity in
some fluid then the curl

00:01:40.788 --> 00:01:47.430
measures how much rotation is
taking place in that fluid.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:02:05.469
Measures the rotation part of a
velocity field.

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:13.798
More precisely the direction
corresponds to the axis of

00:02:13.798 --> 00:02:22.744
rotation and the magnitude
corresponds to twice the angular

00:02:22.744 --> 00:02:24.750
velocity.

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.620
Just to give you a few quick
examples.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.310
If I take a constant vector
field,

00:02:53.310 --> 00:03:01.139
so everything translates at the
same speed,

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:06.051
then obviously when you take
the partial derivatives you will

00:03:06.051 --> 00:03:10.389
just get a bunch of zeros so the
curl will be zero.

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:15.219
If you take a vector field that
stretches things,

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:17.942
let's say, for example,
we are going to stretch things

00:03:17.942 --> 00:03:23.173
along the x-axis,
that would be a vector field

00:03:23.173 --> 00:03:30.680
that goes parallel to the x
direction but maybe,

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.272
say, x times i.
So that when you are in front

00:03:33.272 --> 00:03:35.500
of a plane of a blackboard you
are moving forward,

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.990
when you are behind you are
moving backwards,

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.889
things are getting expanded in
the x direction.

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:48.460
If you compute the curl,
you can check each of these.

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:49.310
Again, they are going to be
zero.

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.039
There is no curl.
This is not what curl measures.

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:58.705
I mean, actually,
what measures expansion,

00:03:58.705 --> 00:04:03.680
stretching is actually
divergence.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.180
If you take the divergence of
this field,

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.770
you would get one plus zero
plus zero,

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.810
it looks like it will be one, 
so in case you don't remember, 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.308
I mean divergence precisely
measures this stretching effect

00:04:15.308 --> 00:04:18.490
in your field.
And, on the other hand, 

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:22.376
if you take something that
corresponds to,

00:04:22.376 --> 00:04:26.675
say,
rotation about the z-axis at

00:04:26.675 --> 00:04:34.335
unit angular velocity -- That
means they are going to moving

00:04:34.335 --> 00:04:41.291
in circles around the z-axis.
One way to write down this

00:04:41.291 --> 00:04:46.463
field, let's see,
the z component is zero because

00:04:46.463 --> 00:04:50.450
everything is moving
horizontally.

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:54.829
And in the x and y directions, 
if you look at it from above, 

00:04:54.829 --> 00:04:59.068
well, it is just going to be
our good old friend the vector

00:04:59.068 --> 00:05:02.649
field that rotates everything
[at unit speed?].

00:05:02.649 --> 00:05:05.639
And we have seen the formula
for this one many times.

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:09.680
The first component is minus y,
the second one is x.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:17.478
Now, if you compute the curl of
this guy, you will get zero,

00:05:17.478 --> 00:05:21.589
zero, two, two k.
And so k is the axis of

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:24.720
rotation, two is twice the
angular velocity.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.566
And now, of course, 
you can imagine much more

00:05:26.566 --> 00:05:29.589
complicated motions where you
will have -- For example,

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:32.278
if you look at the Charles
River very carefully then you

00:05:32.278 --> 00:05:34.840
will see that water is flowing,
generally speaking, 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.477
towards the ocean.
But, at the same time,

00:05:38.477 --> 00:05:43.846
there are actually a few eddies
in there and with water

00:05:43.846 --> 00:05:47.715
swirling.
Those are the places where

00:05:47.715 --> 00:05:51.420
there is actually curl in the
flow.

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:56.726
Yes.
I don't know how to turn out

00:05:56.726 --> 00:06:00.530
the lights a bit,
but I'm sure there is a way.

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:10.510
Does this do it?
Is it working?

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:23.129
OK.
You're welcome.

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:31.660
Hopefully it is easier to see
now.

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:35.512
That was about curl.
Now, why do we care about curl

00:06:35.512 --> 00:06:40.350
besides this motivation of
understanding motions?

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:43.529
One place where it comes up is
when we try to understand

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:45.899
whether a vector field is
conservative.

00:06:45.899 --> 00:06:49.702
Remember we have seen that a
vector field is conservative if

00:06:49.702 --> 00:06:53.209
and only if its curl is zero.
That is the situation in which

00:06:53.209 --> 00:06:56.078
we are allowed to try to look
for a potential function and

00:06:56.078 --> 00:06:57.889
then use the fundamental
theorem.

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:00.089
But another place where this
comes up,

00:07:00.089 --> 00:07:02.439
if you remember what we did in
the plane,

00:07:02.439 --> 00:07:06.138
curl also came up when we tried
to convert nine integrals into

00:07:06.138 --> 00:07:10.240
double integrals.
That was Greene's theorem.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:19.287
Well, it turns out we can do
the same thing in space and that

00:07:19.287 --> 00:07:28.350
is called Stokes' theorem.
What does Stokes' theorem say?

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:36.731
It says that the work done by a
vector field along a closed

00:07:36.731 --> 00:07:44.680
curve can be replaced by a
double integral of curl F.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.870
Let me write it using the dell
notation.

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:54.374
That is curl F.
Dot ndS on a suitably chosen

00:07:54.374 --> 00:07:58.039
surface.
That is a very strange kind of

00:07:58.039 --> 00:08:01.215
statement.
But actually it is not much

00:08:01.215 --> 00:08:04.990
more strange than things we have
seen before.

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:09.579
I should clarify what this
means.

00:08:09.579 --> 00:08:17.060
C has to be a closed curve in
space.

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:32.230
And S can be any surface
bounded by C.

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:36.095
For example, 
what Stokes' theorem tells me

00:08:36.095 --> 00:08:41.386
is that let us say that I have
to compute some line integral on

00:08:41.386 --> 00:08:48.578
maybe,
say, the unit circle in the x,

00:08:48.578 --> 00:08:52.695
y plane.
Of course I can set a line

00:08:52.695 --> 00:08:57.892
integral directly and compute it
by setting x equals cosine T,

00:08:57.892 --> 00:09:00.789
y equals sine T,
z equals zero.

00:09:00.789 --> 00:09:03.911
But maybe sometimes I don't
want to do that because my

00:09:03.911 --> 00:09:06.090
vector field is really
complicated.

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:11.116
And instead I will want to
reduce things to a surface

00:09:11.116 --> 00:09:13.684
integral.
Now, I know that you guys are

00:09:13.684 --> 00:09:16.485
not necessarily fond of
computing flux of vector fields

00:09:16.485 --> 00:09:19.390
for surfaces so maybe you don't
really see the point.

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:22.264
But sometimes it is useful.
Sometimes it is also useful

00:09:22.264 --> 00:09:25.203
backwards because,
actually, you have a surface

00:09:25.203 --> 00:09:29.100
integral that you would like to
turn into a line integral.

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:34.682
What Stokes' theorem says is
that I can choose my favorite

00:09:34.682 --> 00:09:38.600
surface whose boundary is this
circle.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:42.382
I could choose,
for example,

00:09:42.382 --> 00:09:50.646
a half sphere if I want or I
can choose, let's call that s1,

00:09:50.646 --> 00:09:54.569
I don't know,
a pointy thing,

00:09:54.569 --> 00:09:57.600
s2.
Probably the most logical one,

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.490
actually, would be just to
choose a disk in the x,

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:02.529
y plane.
That would probably be the

00:10:02.529 --> 00:10:04.880
easiest one to set up for
calculating flux.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.700
Anyway, 
what Stokes' theorem tells me

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:09.990
is I can choose any of these
surfaces,

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:14.000
whichever one I want, 
and I can compute the flux of

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.361
curl F through this surface.
Curl F is a new vector field

00:10:18.361 --> 00:10:22.136
when you have this formula that
gives you a vector field you

00:10:22.136 --> 00:10:25.399
compute its flux through your
favorite surface,

00:10:25.399 --> 00:10:31.464
and you should get the same
thing as if you had done the

00:10:31.464 --> 00:10:37.680
line integral for F.
That is the statement.

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:43.509
Now, there is a catch here.
What is the catch?

00:10:43.509 --> 00:10:47.501
Well, the catch is we have to
figure out what conventions to

00:10:47.501 --> 00:10:51.290
use because remember when we
have a surface there are two

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:54.765
possible orientations.
We have to decide which way we

00:10:54.765 --> 00:10:58.139
will counter flux positively,
which way we will counter flux

00:10:58.139 --> 00:11:01.212
negatively.
And, if we change our choice,

00:11:01.212 --> 00:11:05.129
then of course the flux will
become the opposite.

00:11:05.129 --> 00:11:08.593
Well, similarly to define the
work, I need to choose which way

00:11:08.593 --> 00:11:12.129
I am going to run my curve.
If I change which way I go

00:11:12.129 --> 00:11:16.200
around the curve then my work
will become the opposite.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:21.013
What happens is I have to
orient the curve C and the

00:11:21.013 --> 00:11:28.335
surface S in compatible ways.
We have to figure out what the

00:11:28.335 --> 00:11:36.978
rule is for how the orientation
of S and that of C relate to

00:11:36.978 --> 00:11:41.919
each other.
What about orientation?

00:11:41.919 --> 00:11:55.509
Well, we need the orientations
of C and S to be compatible and

00:11:55.509 --> 00:12:05.980
they have to explain to you what
the rule is.

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:15.123
Let me show you a picture.
The rule is if I walk along C

00:12:15.123 --> 00:12:23.249
with S to my left then the
normal vector is pointing up for

00:12:23.249 --> 00:12:29.580
me.
Let me write that.

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:37.636
If I walk along C,
I should say in the positive

00:12:37.636 --> 00:12:48.320
direction, in the direction that
I have chosen to orient C.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:13:06.430
With S to my left then n is
pointing up for me.

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:10.213
Here is the example.
If I am walking on this curve,

00:13:10.213 --> 00:13:12.460
it looks like the surface is to
my left.

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:19.540
And so the normal vector is
going towards what is up for me.

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:26.149
Any questions about that?
I see some people using their

00:13:26.149 --> 00:13:28.218
right hands.
That is also right-handable

00:13:28.218 --> 00:13:31.070
which I am going to say in just
a few moments.

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:32.610
That is another way to remember
this.

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:38.110
Before I tell you about the
right-handable version,

00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:43.295
let me just try something.
Actually, I am not happy with

00:13:43.295 --> 00:13:47.506
this orientation of C and I want
to orient my curve C going

00:13:47.506 --> 00:13:51.879
clockwise on the picture.
So the other orientation.

00:13:51.879 --> 00:13:55.519
Then, if I walk on it this way,
the surface would be to my

00:13:55.519 --> 00:13:56.899
right.
You can remember,

00:13:56.899 --> 00:13:59.149
if it helps you,
that if a surface is to your

00:13:59.149 --> 00:14:01.450
right then the normal vector
will go down.

00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:04.149
The other way to think about
this rule is enough because if

00:14:04.149 --> 00:14:07.569
you are walking clockwise,
well, you can change that to

00:14:07.569 --> 00:14:10.970
counterclockwise just by walking
upside down.

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:14.870
This guy is walking clockwise
on C.

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:21.905
And while for him,
if you look carefully at the

00:14:21.905 --> 00:14:31.693
picture, the surface is actually
to his left when you flip upside

00:14:31.693 --> 00:14:34.570
down.
Yeah, it is kind of confusing.

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:38.394
But, anyway,
maybe it's easier if you

00:14:38.394 --> 00:14:44.959
actually rotate in the picture.
And now it is getting actually

00:14:44.959 --> 00:14:50.160
really confusing because his
walking upside up with,

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:54.240
actually, the surface is to his
left.

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:58.191
I mean where he is at here is
actually at the front and this

00:14:58.191 --> 00:15:01.340
is the back, but that is kind of
hard to see.

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:05.340
Anyway, whichever method will
work best for you.

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:07.824
Perhaps it is easiest to first
do it with the other

00:15:07.824 --> 00:15:09.530
orientation,
this one, 

00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:13.169
and this side, 
if you want the opposite one, 

00:15:13.169 --> 00:15:21.250
then you will just flip
everything.

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:25.554
Now, what is the other way of
remembering this with the

00:15:25.554 --> 00:15:27.614
right-hand rule?
First of all,

00:15:27.614 --> 00:15:29.389
take your right hand,
not your left.

00:15:29.389 --> 00:15:32.059
Even if your right hand is
actually using a pen or

00:15:32.059 --> 00:15:34.730
something like that in your
right hand do this.

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:37.670
And let's take your fingers in
order.

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:40.492
First your thumb.
Let's make your thumb go along

00:15:40.492 --> 00:15:42.490
the object that has only one
dimension in there.

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:47.943
That is the curve.
Well, let's look at the top

00:15:47.943 --> 00:15:52.244
picture up there.
I want my thumb to go along the

00:15:52.244 --> 00:15:56.309
curve so that is kind of towards
the right.

00:15:56.309 --> 00:16:06.357
Then I want to make my index
finger point towards the

00:16:06.357 --> 00:16:09.576
surface.
Towards the surface I mean

00:16:09.576 --> 00:16:12.149
towards the interior of the
surface from the curve.

00:16:12.149 --> 00:16:15.340
And when I am on the curve I am
on the boundary of the surface,

00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:18.240
so there is a direction along
the surface that is the curve

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:20.690
and the other one is pointing
into the surface.

00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:24.225
That one would be pointing kind
of to the back slightly up

00:16:24.225 --> 00:16:27.441
maybe, so like that.
And now your middle finger is

00:16:27.441 --> 00:16:30.889
going to point in the direction
of the normal vector.

00:16:30.889 --> 00:16:37.422
That is up, at least if you
have the same kind of right hand

00:16:37.422 --> 00:16:49.790
as I do.
The other way of doing it is

00:16:49.790 --> 00:17:08.289
using the right-hand rule along
C positively.

00:17:08.289 --> 00:17:18.130
The index finger towards the
interior of S.

00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:27.664
Sorry, I shouldn't say interior.
I should say tangent to S

00:17:27.664 --> 00:17:34.662
towards the interior of S.
What I mean by that is really

00:17:34.662 --> 00:17:39.346
the part of S that is not its
boundary, so the rest of the

00:17:39.346 --> 00:17:49.892
surface.
Then the middle finger points

00:17:49.892 --> 00:18:00.809
parallel to n.
Let's practice.

00:18:00.809 --> 00:18:09.240
Let's say that I gave you this
curve bounding this surface.

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:13.050
Which way do you think the
normal vector will be going?

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:16.975
Up. Yes. Everyone is voting up.
Imaging that I am walking

00:18:16.975 --> 00:18:18.940
around C.
That is to my left.

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:24.994
Normal vector points up.
Imagine that you put your thumb

00:18:24.994 --> 00:18:32.319
along C, your index towards S
and then your middle finger

00:18:32.319 --> 00:18:36.690
points up.
Very good.

00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:43.530
N points up.
Another one.

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:07.770
It is interesting to watch you
guys.

00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:13.161
I think mostly it is going up.
The correct answer is it goes

00:19:13.161 --> 00:19:20.190
up and into the cone.
How do we see that?

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:24.015
Well, one way to think about it
is imagine that you are walking

00:19:24.015 --> 00:19:27.289
on C, on the rim of this cone.
You have two options.

00:19:27.289 --> 00:19:30.259
Imagine that you are walking
kind of inside or imagine that

00:19:30.259 --> 00:19:33.432
you are walking kind of outside.
If you are walking outside then

00:19:33.432 --> 00:19:35.650
S is to your right,
but it does not sound good.

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:39.756
Let's say instead that you are
walking on the inside of a cone

00:19:39.756 --> 00:19:43.119
following the boundary.
Well, then the surface is to

00:19:43.119 --> 00:19:45.845
your left.
And so the normal vector will

00:19:45.845 --> 00:19:50.119
be up for you which means it
will be pointing slightly up and

00:19:50.119 --> 00:19:52.440
into the cone.
Another way to think about it, 

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:56.359
through the right-hand rule, 
from this way index going kind

00:19:56.359 --> 00:20:00.789
of down because the surface goes
down and a bit to the back.

00:20:00.789 --> 00:20:04.730
And then the normal vector
points up and in.

00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:08.710
Yet another way,
if you deform continuously your

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:12.690
surface then the conventions
will not change.

00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:15.026
See, this is kind of
topology

00:20:15.026 --> 00:20:17.528
in a way.
You can deform things and

00:20:17.528 --> 00:20:21.621
nothing will change.
So what if we somehow flatten

00:20:21.621 --> 00:20:27.250
our cone, push it a bit up so
that it becomes completely flat?

00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:30.286
Then, if you had a flat disk
with the curve going

00:20:30.286 --> 00:20:33.450
counterclockwise,
the normal vector would go up.

00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:36.440
Now take your disk with its
normal vector sticking up.

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:39.792
If you want to paint the face a
different color so that you can

00:20:39.792 --> 00:20:43.090
remember that was beside with a
normal vector and then push it

00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:45.516
back down to the cone,
you will see that the painted

00:20:45.516 --> 00:20:48.551
face,
the one with the normal vector

00:20:48.551 --> 00:20:52.940
on that side is the one that is
inside and up.

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:59.731
Does that make sense?
Anyway, I think you have just

00:20:59.731 --> 00:21:03.790
to play with these examples for
long enough and get it.

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:07.684
OK. The last one.
Let's say that I have a

00:21:07.684 --> 00:21:10.229
cylinder.
So now this guy has actually

00:21:10.229 --> 00:21:12.799
two boundary curves,
C and C prime.

00:21:12.799 --> 00:21:16.474
And let's say I want to orient
my cylinder so that the normal

00:21:16.474 --> 00:21:20.905
vector sticks out.
How should I choose the

00:21:20.905 --> 00:21:30.265
orientation of my curves?
Let's start with,

00:21:30.265 --> 00:21:40.051
say, the bottom one.
Would the bottom one be going

00:21:40.051 --> 00:21:44.478
clockwise or counterclockwise.
Most people seem to say

00:21:44.478 --> 00:21:47.220
counterclockwise,
and I agree with that.

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:51.810
Let me write that down and
claim C prime should go

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:55.292
counterclockwise.
One way to think about it,

00:21:55.292 --> 00:21:58.632
actually, it's quite easy,
you mentioned that you're

00:21:58.632 --> 00:22:02.299
walking on the outside of the
cylinder along C prime.

00:22:02.299 --> 00:22:06.518
If you want to walk along C
prime so that the cylinder is to

00:22:06.518 --> 00:22:10.879
your left, that means you have
to actually go counterclockwise

00:22:10.879 --> 00:22:14.728
around it.
The other way is use your right

00:22:14.728 --> 00:22:17.011
hand.
Say when you're at the front of

00:22:17.011 --> 00:22:19.220
C prime,
your thumb points to the right, 

00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:23.359
your index points up because
that's where the surface is,

00:22:23.359 --> 00:22:28.650
and then your middle finger
will point out.

00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:39.033
What about C?
Well, C I claim we should be

00:22:39.033 --> 00:22:43.135
doing clockwise.
I mean think about just walking

00:22:43.135 --> 00:22:46.200
again on the surface of the
cylinder along C.

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:52.112
If you walk clockwise,
you will see that the surface

00:22:52.112 --> 00:22:57.329
is to your left or use the
right-hand rule.

00:22:57.329 --> 00:23:00.621
Now, if a problem gives you
neither the orientation of a

00:23:00.621 --> 00:23:04.271
curve nor that of the surface
then it's up to you to make them

00:23:04.271 --> 00:23:05.828
up.
But you have to make them up in

00:23:05.828 --> 00:23:09.087
a consistent way.
You cannot choose them both at

00:23:09.087 --> 00:23:13.769
random.
All right.

00:23:13.769 --> 00:23:30.779
Now we're all set to try to use
Stokes' theorem.

00:23:30.779 --> 00:23:35.369
Well, let me do an example
first.

00:23:35.369 --> 00:23:43.850
The first example that I will
do is actually a comparison.

00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:52.757
Stokes' versus Green.
I want to show you how Green's

00:23:52.757 --> 00:23:55.349
theorem for work that we saw in
the plane,

00:23:55.349 --> 00:23:58.589
but also involved work and curl
and so on,

00:23:58.589 --> 00:24:04.329
is actually a special case of
this.

00:24:04.329 --> 00:24:11.638
Let's say that we will look at
the special case where our curve

00:24:11.638 --> 00:24:16.589
C is actually a curve in the x,
y plane.

00:24:16.589 --> 00:24:19.537
And let's make it go
counterclockwise in the x,

00:24:19.537 --> 00:24:23.190
y plane because that's what we
did for Green's theorem.

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:25.880
Now let's choose a surface
bounded by this curve.

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:28.941
Well, as I said,
I could make up any surface

00:24:28.941 --> 00:24:32.430
that comes to my mind.
But, if I want to relate to

00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:35.264
this stuff, I should probably
stay in the x,

00:24:35.264 --> 00:24:38.648
y plane.
So I am just going to take my

00:24:38.648 --> 00:24:43.964
surface to be the piece of the
x, y plane that is inside my

00:24:43.964 --> 00:24:52.167
curve.
So let's say S is going to be a

00:24:52.167 --> 00:25:02.162
portion of x,
y plane bounded by a curve C,

00:25:02.162 --> 00:25:11.920
and the curve C goes
counterclockwise.

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:17.410
Well, then I should look at
[the table?].

00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:24.320
For work along C of my favorite
vector field F dot dr.

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:31.099
So that will be the line
integral of Pdx plus Qdy.

00:25:31.099 --> 00:25:34.856
Like I said,
if I call the components of my

00:25:34.856 --> 00:25:38.880
field P, Q and R,
it will be Pdx plus Qdy plus

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:42.190
Rdz, but I don't have any Z
here.

00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:49.517
Dz is zero on C.
If I evaluate for line

00:25:49.517 --> 00:25:53.340
integral, I don't have any term
involving dz.

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:59.154
Z is zero.
Now, let's see what Strokes

00:25:59.154 --> 00:26:05.133
says.
Stokes says instead I can

00:26:05.133 --> 00:26:13.329
compute for flux through S of
curve F.

00:26:13.329 --> 00:26:17.710
But now what's the normal
vector to my surface?

00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:19.960
Well, it's going to be either k
or negative k.

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:22.950
I just have to figure out which
one it is.

00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:25.886
Well, if you followed what
we've done there,

00:26:25.886 --> 00:26:30.121
you know that the normal vector
compatible with this choice for

00:26:30.121 --> 00:26:32.990
the curve C is the one that
points up.

00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:43.231
My normal vector is just going
to be k hat, so I am going to

00:26:43.231 --> 00:26:49.480
replace my normal vector by k
hat.

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:53.411
That means, actually,
I will be integrating curl dot

00:26:53.411 --> 00:26:56.724
k.
That means I am integrating the

00:26:56.724 --> 00:27:04.990
z component of curl.
Let's look at curl F dot k.

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:14.369
That's the z component of curl
F.

00:27:14.369 --> 00:27:18.759
And what's the z component of
curl?

00:27:18.759 --> 00:27:21.850
Well, I conveniently still have
the values up there.

00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:36.216
It's Q sub x minus P sub y.
My double integral becomes

00:27:36.216 --> 00:27:42.090
double integral of Q sub x minus
P sub y.

00:27:42.090 --> 00:27:46.633
What about dS?
Well, I am in a piece of the x,

00:27:46.633 --> 00:27:52.233
y plane, so dS is just dxdy or
your favorite combination that

00:27:52.233 --> 00:27:56.882
does the same thing.
Now, see, if you look at this

00:27:56.882 --> 00:28:02.145
equality, integral of Pdx plus
Qdy along a closed curve equals

00:28:02.145 --> 00:28:05.509
double integral of Qx minus Py
dxdy.

00:28:05.509 --> 00:28:11.890
That is exactly the statement
of Green's theorem.

00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:17.132
I mean except at that time we
called things m and n,

00:28:17.132 --> 00:28:20.730
but really that shouldn't
matter.

00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:35.549
This tells you that,
in fact, Green's theorem is

00:28:35.549 --> 00:28:51.630
just a special case of Stokes'
in the x, y plane.

00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:55.212
Now, another small remark I
want to make right away before I

00:28:55.212 --> 00:28:57.492
forget,
you might think that these

00:28:57.492 --> 00:29:01.288
rules that we've made up about
compatibility of orientations

00:29:01.288 --> 00:29:05.382
are completely arbitrary.
Well, they are literally in the

00:29:05.382 --> 00:29:10.039
same way as our convention for
which we guy curl is arbitrary.

00:29:10.039 --> 00:29:14.227
We chose to make the curl be
this thing and not the opposite

00:29:14.227 --> 00:29:17.990
which would have been pretty
much just as sensible.

00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:21.050
And, ultimately,
that comes from our choice of

00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:25.200
making the cross-product be what
it is but of the opposite.

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:30.081
Ultimately, it all comes from
our preference for right-handed

00:29:30.081 --> 00:29:33.564
coordinate systems.
If we had been on the planet

00:29:33.564 --> 00:29:36.860
with left-handed coordinate
systems then actually our

00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:40.030
conventions would be all the
other way around,

00:29:40.030 --> 00:30:05.279
but they are this way.
Any other questions?

00:30:05.279 --> 00:30:08.784
A surface that you use in
Stokes' theorem is usually not

00:30:08.784 --> 00:30:12.607
going to be closed because its
boundary needs to be the curve

00:30:12.607 --> 00:30:14.679
C.
So if you had a closed surface

00:30:14.679 --> 00:30:17.099
you wouldn't know where to put
your curve.

00:30:17.099 --> 00:30:20.551
I mean of course you could make
a tiny hole in it and get a tiny

00:30:20.551 --> 00:30:22.630
curve.
Actually, what that would say, 

00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:26.238
and we are going to see more
about that so not very important

00:30:26.238 --> 00:30:28.570
right now,
but what we would see is that

00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:31.940
for a close surface we would end
up getting zero for the flux.

00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:34.720
And that is actually because
divergence of curl is zero,

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:36.490
but I am getting ahead of
myself.

00:30:36.490 --> 00:30:45.884
We are going to see that
probably tomorrow in more

00:30:45.884 --> 00:30:49.467
detail.
Stokes' theorem only works if

00:30:49.467 --> 00:30:53.925
you can make sense of this.
That means you need your vector

00:30:53.925 --> 00:30:58.912
field to be continuous and
differentiable everywhere on the

00:30:58.912 --> 00:31:03.380
surface S.
Now, why is that relevant?

00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:05.873
Well, say that your vector
field was not defined at the

00:31:05.873 --> 00:31:07.720
origin and say that you wanted
to do,

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:11.413
you know, the example that I
had first with the unit circling

00:31:11.413 --> 00:31:14.030
the x, y plane.
Normally, the most sensible

00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:17.404
choice of surface to apply
Stokes' theorem to would be just

00:31:17.404 --> 00:31:19.440
the flat disk in the x,
y plane.

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:23.010
But that assumes that your
vector field is well-defined

00:31:23.010 --> 00:31:24.753
there.
If your vector field is not

00:31:24.753 --> 00:31:27.091
defined at the origin but
defined everywhere else you

00:31:27.091 --> 00:31:29.534
cannot use this guy,
but maybe you can still use,

00:31:29.534 --> 00:31:31.240
say, the half-sphere,
for example.

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:35.048
Or, you could use a piece of
cylinder plus a flat top or

00:31:35.048 --> 00:31:38.650
whatever you want but not
pressing for the origin.

00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:41.297
So you could still use Stokes
but you'd have to be careful

00:31:41.297 --> 00:31:44.992
about which surface you choose.
Now, if instead your vector

00:31:44.992 --> 00:31:49.878
field is not defined anywhere on
the z-axis then you're out of

00:31:49.878 --> 00:31:54.764
luck because there is no way to
find a surface bounded by this

00:31:54.764 --> 00:31:59.170
unit circle without crossing the
z-axis somewhere.

00:31:59.170 --> 00:32:07.700
Then you wouldn't be able to
Stokes' theorem at all or at

00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:16.178
least not directly.
Maybe I should write it F

00:32:16.178 --> 00:32:25.680
defines a differentiable
everywhere on this.

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:27.930
But we don't care about what
happens outside of this.

00:32:27.930 --> 00:32:35.259
It's really only on the surface
that we need it to be OK.

00:32:35.259 --> 00:32:39.094
I mean, again,
99% of the vector fields that

00:32:39.094 --> 00:32:44.355
we see in this class are defined
everywhere so that's not an

00:32:44.355 --> 00:32:47.030
urgent concern,
but still.

00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:49.970
OK.
Should we move on?

00:32:49.970 --> 00:33:01.011
Yes. I have a yes.
Let me explain to you quickly

00:33:01.011 --> 00:33:08.386
why Stokes is true.
How do we prove a theorem like

00:33:08.386 --> 00:33:10.349
that?
Well, 

00:33:10.349 --> 00:33:12.549
the strategy,
I mean there are other ways,

00:33:12.549 --> 00:33:16.065
but the least painful strategy
at this point is to observe what

00:33:16.065 --> 00:33:19.240
we already know is a special
case of Stokes's theorem.

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:22.539
Namely we know the case where
the curve is actually in the x,

00:33:22.539 --> 00:33:24.890
y plane and the surface is a
flat piece of the x,

00:33:24.890 --> 00:33:34.650
y plane because that's Green's
theorem which we proved a while

00:33:34.650 --> 00:33:42.633
ago.
We know it for C and S in the

00:33:42.633 --> 00:33:47.202
x, y plane.
Now, what if C and S were,

00:33:47.202 --> 00:33:49.696
say, in the y,
z plane instead of the x,

00:33:49.696 --> 00:33:51.927
y plane?
Well, then it will not quite

00:33:51.927 --> 00:33:55.256
give the same picture because
the normal vector would be i hat

00:33:55.256 --> 00:33:58.530
instead of k hat and they would
be having different notations

00:33:58.530 --> 00:34:01.039
and it would be integrating with
y and z.

00:34:01.039 --> 00:34:02.990
But you see that it would
become, again,

00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:05.860
exactly the same formula.
We'd know it for any of the

00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:08.942
coordinate planes.
In fact, I claim we know it for

00:34:08.942 --> 00:34:13.010
absolutely any plane.
And the reason for that is, 

00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:15.219
sure, when we write it in
coordinates,

00:34:15.219 --> 00:34:19.977
when we write that this line
integral is integral of Pdx plus

00:34:19.977 --> 00:34:24.655
Qdy plus Rdz or when we write
that the curl is given by this

00:34:24.655 --> 00:34:28.539
formula we use the x,
y, z coordinate system.

00:34:28.539 --> 00:34:30.489
But there is something I
haven't quite told you about.

00:34:30.489 --> 00:34:33.739
Which is if I switch to any
other right-handed coordinate

00:34:33.739 --> 00:34:35.849
system,
so I do some sort of rotation

00:34:35.849 --> 00:34:40.960
of my space coordinates,
then somehow the line integral, 

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:44.728
the flux integral, 
the notion of curl makes sense

00:34:44.728 --> 00:34:47.794
in coordinates.
And the reason is that they all

00:34:47.794 --> 00:34:50.038
have geometric interpretations.
For example,

00:34:50.038 --> 00:34:52.579
when I think of this as the
work done by a force,

00:34:52.579 --> 00:34:55.139
well, the force doesn't care
whether it's being put in x,

00:34:55.139 --> 00:34:56.829
y coordinates this way or that
way.

00:34:56.829 --> 00:35:00.170
It still does the same work
because it's the same force.

00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:03.776
And when I say that the curl
measures the rotation in a

00:35:03.776 --> 00:35:06.047
motion, well,
that depends on which

00:35:06.047 --> 00:35:09.657
coordinates you use.
And the same for interpretation

00:35:09.657 --> 00:35:12.455
of flux.
In fact, if I rotated my

00:35:12.455 --> 00:35:17.625
coordinates to fit with any
other plane, I could still do

00:35:17.625 --> 00:35:23.186
the same things.
What I'm trying to say is,

00:35:23.186 --> 00:35:31.825
in fact, if C and S are in any
plane then we can still claim

00:35:31.825 --> 00:35:37.389
that it reduces to Green's
theorem.

00:35:37.389 --> 00:35:45.012
It will be Green's theorem not
in x, y, z coordinates but in

00:35:45.012 --> 00:35:50.179
some funny rotated coordinate
systems.

00:35:50.179 --> 00:35:56.215
What I'm saying is that work,
flux and curl makes sense

00:35:56.215 --> 00:35:59.680
independently of coordinates.

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:23.142
Now, this has to stop somewhere.
I can start claiming that I can

00:36:23.142 --> 00:36:26.000
somehow bend my coordinates to a
plane, any surface is flat.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.314
That doesn't really work.
But what I can say is if I have

00:36:29.314 --> 00:36:31.900
any surface I can cut it into
tiny pieces.

00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:35.030
And these tiny pieces are
basically flat.

00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:39.110
So that's basically the idea of
a proof.

00:36:39.110 --> 00:36:47.364
I am going to decompose my
surface into very small flat

00:36:47.364 --> 00:36:56.546
pieces.
Given any S we are just going

00:36:56.546 --> 00:37:08.929
to decompose it into tiny almost
flat pieces.

00:37:08.929 --> 00:37:15.657
For example,
if I have my surface like this,

00:37:15.657 --> 00:37:23.480
what I will do is I will just
cut it into tiles.

00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:28.356
I mean a good example of that
is if you look at

00:37:28.356 --> 00:37:31.429
those geodesic things,
for example,

00:37:31.429 --> 00:37:36.730
it's made of all these hexagons
and pentagons.

00:37:36.730 --> 00:37:38.595
Well, actually,
they're not quite flat in the

00:37:38.595 --> 00:37:41.055
usual rule, but you could make
them flat and it would still

00:37:41.055 --> 00:37:45.334
look pretty much like a sphere.
Anyway, you're going to cut

00:37:45.334 --> 00:37:49.369
your surface into lots of tiny
pieces.

00:37:49.369 --> 00:37:53.260
And then you can use Stokes'
theorem on each small piece.

00:37:53.260 --> 00:38:00.998
What it says on each small flat
piece -- It says that the line

00:38:00.998 --> 00:38:04.670
integral along say,
for example,

00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:08.923
this curve is equal to the flux
of a curl through this tiny

00:38:08.923 --> 00:38:12.038
piece of surface.
And now I will add all of these

00:38:12.038 --> 00:38:14.447
terms together.
If I add all of the small

00:38:14.447 --> 00:38:17.190
contributions to flux I get the
total flux.

00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:19.969
What if I add all of the small
line integrals?

00:38:19.969 --> 00:38:23.116
Well, I get lots of extra junk
because I never asked to compute

00:38:23.116 --> 00:38:26.747
the line integral along this.
But this guy will come in twice

00:38:26.747 --> 00:38:30.930
when I do this little plate and
when I do that little plate with

00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:34.373
opposite orientations.
When I sum all of the little

00:38:34.373 --> 00:38:38.196
line integrals together,
all of the inner things cancel

00:38:38.196 --> 00:38:40.532
out,
and the only ones that I go

00:38:40.532 --> 00:38:44.900
through only once are those that
are at the outer most edges.

00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:50.577
So, when I sum all of my works
together, I will get the work

00:38:50.577 --> 00:38:54.329
done just along the outer
boundary C.

00:38:54.329 --> 00:39:12.422
Sum of work around each little
piece is just actually the work

00:39:12.422 --> 00:39:27.379
along C, the outer curve.
And the sum of the flux for

00:39:27.379 --> 00:39:39.219
each piece is going to be the
flux through S.

00:39:39.219 --> 00:39:45.487
From Stokes' theorem for flat
surfaces, I can get it for any

00:39:45.487 --> 00:39:47.863
surface.
I am cheating a little bit

00:39:47.863 --> 00:39:50.842
because you would actually have
to check carefully that this

00:39:50.842 --> 00:39:53.721
approximation where you flatten
the little pieces that are

00:39:53.721 --> 00:39:56.120
almost flat is varied.
But, trust me,

00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:56.840
it actually works.

00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:15.987
Let's do an actual example.
I mean I said example,

00:40:15.987 --> 00:40:19.329
but that was more like getting
us ready for the proof so

00:40:19.329 --> 00:40:22.489
probably that doesn't count as
an actual example.

00:40:22.489 --> 00:40:25.233
I should probably keep these
statements for now so I am not

00:40:25.233 --> 00:40:26.510
going to erase this side.

00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:21.891
Let's do an example.
Let's try to find the work of

00:41:21.891 --> 00:41:40.838
vector field zi plus xj plus yk
around the unit circle in the x,

00:41:40.838 --> 00:41:58.337
y plane counterclockwise.
The picture is conveniently

00:41:58.337 --> 00:42:05.497
already there.
Just as a quick review,

00:42:05.497 --> 00:42:08.719
let's see how we do that
directly.

00:42:08.719 --> 00:42:14.295
If we do that directly,
I have to find the integral

00:42:14.295 --> 00:42:21.223
along C.
So F dot dr becomes zdx plus

00:42:21.223 --> 00:42:28.503
xdy plus ydz.
But now we actually know that

00:42:28.503 --> 00:42:33.480
on this circle,
well, z is zero.

00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:39.933
And we can parameterize x and
y, the unit circle in the x,

00:42:39.933 --> 00:42:44.575
y plane, so we can take x
equals cosine t,

00:42:44.575 --> 00:42:49.387
y equals sine t.
That will just become the

00:42:49.387 --> 00:42:54.314
integral over C.
Well, z times dx,

00:42:54.314 --> 00:43:05.400
z is zero so we have nothing,
plus x is cosine t times dy is

00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:17.050
-- Well, if y is sine t then dy
is cosine tdt plus ydz but z is

00:43:17.050 --> 00:43:22.066
zero.
Now, the range of values for t,

00:43:22.066 --> 00:43:26.619
well, we are going
counterclockwise around the

00:43:26.619 --> 00:43:31.880
entire circle so that should go
from zero to 2pi.

00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:39.460
We will get integral from zero
to 2pi of cosine square tdt

00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:45.844
which, if you do the
calculation, turns out to be

00:43:45.844 --> 00:43:50.958
just pi.
Now, let's instead try to use

00:43:50.958 --> 00:43:55.690
Stokes' theorem to do the
calculation.

00:43:55.690 --> 00:44:00.570
Now, of course the smart choice
would be to just take the flat

00:44:00.570 --> 00:44:02.720
unit disk.
I am not going to do that.

00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:06.358
That would be too boring.
Plus we have already kind of

00:44:06.358 --> 00:44:09.099
checked it because we already
trust Green's theorem.

00:44:09.099 --> 00:44:11.039
Instead, just to convince you
that,

00:44:11.039 --> 00:44:14.480
yes, I can choose really any
surface I want,

00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:23.471
let's say that I'm going to
choose a piece of paraboloid z

00:44:23.471 --> 00:44:30.570
equals one minus x squared minus
y squared.

00:44:30.570 --> 00:44:36.582
Well, to get our conventions
straight, we should take the

00:44:36.582 --> 00:44:43.239
normal vector pointing up for
compatibility with our choice.

00:44:43.239 --> 00:44:48.239
Well, we will have to compute
the flux through S.

00:44:48.239 --> 00:44:50.280
We don't really have to because
we could have chosen the disk,

00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:54.046
it would be easier, 
but if we want to do it this

00:44:54.046 --> 00:45:00.630
way we will compute the flux of
curl F through our paraboloid.

00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:03.924
How do we do that?
Well, we need to find the curl

00:45:03.924 --> 00:45:10.710
and we need to find ndS.
Let's start with the curl.

00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:23.663
Curl F let's take the
cross-product between dell and F

00:45:23.663 --> 00:45:28.734
which is zxy.
If we compute this,

00:45:28.734 --> 00:45:31.690
the i component will be one
minus zero.

00:45:31.690 --> 00:45:37.607
It looks like it is one i.
Minus the j component is zero

00:45:37.607 --> 00:45:41.776
minus one.
Plus the k component is one

00:45:41.776 --> 00:45:52.751
minus zero.
In fact, the curl of the field

00:45:52.751 --> 00:45:59.980
is one, one, one.
Now, what about ndS?

00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:03.947
Well, this is a surface for
which we know z is a function of

00:46:03.947 --> 00:46:08.610
x and y.
ndS we can write as, 

00:46:08.610 --> 00:46:14.527
let's call this F of xy, 
then we can use the formula

00:46:14.527 --> 00:46:19.148
that says ndS equals negative F
sub x, negative F sub y,

00:46:19.148 --> 00:46:26.997
one dxdy,
which here gives us 2x,

00:46:26.997 --> 00:46:34.593
2y, one dxdy.
Now, when we want to compute

00:46:34.593 --> 00:46:41.807
the flux, we will have to do
double integral over S of one,

00:46:41.807 --> 00:46:47.530
one, one dot product with 2x,
2y, one dxdy.

00:46:47.530 --> 00:46:55.947
It will become the double
integral of 2x plus 2y plus one

00:46:55.947 --> 00:46:58.009
dxdy.
And, of course,

00:46:58.009 --> 00:47:01.710
the region which we are
integrating, the range of values

00:47:01.710 --> 00:47:04.940
of x and y will be the shadow of
our surface.

00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:07.283
That is just going to be,
if you look at this paraboloid

00:47:07.283 --> 00:47:11.280
from above,
all you will see is the unit

00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:17.960
disk so it will be a double
integral of the unit disk.

00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:23.291
And the way we will do that,
one way is to switch to polar

00:47:23.291 --> 00:47:28.062
coordinates and do the
calculation and then you will

00:47:28.062 --> 00:47:31.799
end up with pi.
The other way is to try to do

00:47:31.799 --> 00:47:34.477
it by symmetry.
Observe, when you integrate x

00:47:34.477 --> 00:47:37.783
above this, x is as negative on
the left as it is positive on

00:47:37.783 --> 00:47:40.179
the right.
So the integral of x will be

00:47:40.179 --> 00:47:42.346
zero.
The integral of y will be zero

00:47:42.346 --> 00:47:46.517
also by symmetry.
Then the integral of one dxdy

00:47:46.517 --> 00:47:52.160
will just be the area of this
unit disk which is pi.

00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:54.610
That was our first example.
And, of course, 

00:47:54.610 --> 00:47:57.699
if you're actually free to
choose your favorite surface,

00:47:57.699 --> 00:48:01.066
there is absolutely no reason
why you would actually choose

00:48:01.066 --> 00:48:04.477
this paraboloid in this example.
I mean it would be much easier

00:48:04.477 --> 00:48:05.769
to choose a flat disk.
OK.

00:48:05.769 --> 00:48:09.557
Tomorrow I will tell you a few
more things about curl fits in

00:48:09.557 --> 00:48:13.220
with conservativeness and with
the divergence theorem,

00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:17.099
Stokes all together, 
and we will look at Practice

00:48:17.099 --> 00:48:20.000
Exam 4B so please bring the exam
with you.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:21.000
 
with you.
