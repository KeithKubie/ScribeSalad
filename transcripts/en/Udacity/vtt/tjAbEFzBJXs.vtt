00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.850
All right, here's a big one.

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.290
Finish the SynchAdapter, 
making it fetch the weather

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.230
and store it in the database.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.396
Alter the updateWeather function

00:00:11.396 --> 00:00:14.962
within the ForecastFragment 
to start a sync with the SyncAdapter.

00:00:14.962 --> 00:00:17.710
Some hints here. 
Pull the code from

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.480
on handle intent into our SyncAdapter.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.150
On handle intent is inside 
of our Sunshine service.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.040
The good news is that abstract threaded

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.510
sync adapter provides a background thread

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.710
to run the server fetch on, 
just like intent service does.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.370
Also, just fetch the location

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.540
query from our utility class.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.030
Eventually, we want to run syncs
like this without

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.800
any involvement of the user.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.810
Finally, make the sync adaptor run 
when we call Update Weather.
