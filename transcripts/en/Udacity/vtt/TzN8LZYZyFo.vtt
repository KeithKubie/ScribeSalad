00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:06.010
It doesn't seem to make much sense to have a room that is 0 square meters in

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:10.069
area. So I'm going to say that A of 0 equals 0 does not make sense in the

00:00:10.069 --> 00:00:14.899
context of this story. We know that Grant definitely wants a room to exist. His

00:00:14.899 --> 00:00:19.689
employees want to have a lot of fun. We need actual space to do that in, 0 just

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:24.318
doesn't really make sense. We also have A of negative 3 equals 18 meters

00:00:24.318 --> 00:00:28.930
squared. In this first one that we marked off, neither the input nor the output

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.577
really makes sense. But in the second choice, it's a little bit trickier because

00:00:33.577 --> 00:00:38.257
the output seems totally fine. Grant could conceivably have a room that was 18

00:00:38.257 --> 00:00:43.127
meters squared in area. However, since x is a length, it doesn't really make

00:00:43.127 --> 00:00:47.578
sense to plug in negative 3 for it's value. What kind of ruler could you use to

00:00:47.578 --> 00:00:51.510
measure a negative length? So this trace doesn't really make sense either.
