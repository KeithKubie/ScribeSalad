00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.256
They wanted her piecemealed,
papier-mâchéd,

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.096
practically broken,
limp-like and loveless,

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:22.656
a litany of exaggeration.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.456
They wanted her low.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.936
And high.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.536
Flat and wide.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.256
Filled with all of their empty.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.576
They wanted her to be more like them.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.336
Not knowing her conception was immaculate.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.496
That she was birthed
in sandalwood-scented river water,

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.576
sweet sapphire honey-touched tongue,

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.296
she was too much
of a mouthful for the greedy.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.136
Just a small amount of her
was more than they could stand.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.936
Oh, they wanted her bland.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.176
And barren.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.096
Unspirited, un-African, uncultured,

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.976
under siege in the streets.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.616
They wanted her face down, ass up,
hands cuffed and ankles strapped.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.576
They wanted her knowing
she could never want them back.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.456
Oh, they wanted her holy,

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.336
baptized in her divine,

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.896
they wanted her secrets,

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.576
pearls to swine.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.096
They wanted to unravel
the mystery of her design.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.536
Fascinated by glory,
hypnotized by her kind.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.336
Oh, they wanted her complete.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.896
They wanted her whole,

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.456
though they came fractioned,
half-hearted, half-soul,

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.696
with no regards and no knowledge
as to who she really was.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.920
Oh, but if they knew.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.040
If they knew her,

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.136
praise songs would rain
from the clouds of their eyes,

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.496
clearing the vision, bathing the heart.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.576
They would bow every time they saw her.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.456
Be their best selves when she was around.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.016
If they knew her,

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.896
knew she was the glue to their revolution,

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.456
the life flow of blood
through their veins.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.336
If they knew her,

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.640
she would know,

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.536
she would feel

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.816
that her body is more than battlefield.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.056
More than bone break and bleeding bigotry.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.136
More than bridge
over your troubled conscience.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.816
More than used up, walked on,
driven through, shot up.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.056
More than your "Selma, Lord, Selma"
Edmund Pettus.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.976
More than your killer Katrina Danziger.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.496
More than your bust them out of Baltimore
"Highway to Nowhere."

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.616
If they knew her,

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:22.840
she would know.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.480
(Singing)

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.136
Wild women,

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.736
wild women, they walk with buffalo.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.496
Have lightning on their tongues,

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.216
fly whisks as weapons.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.936
Wild women, they walk with machetes.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.176
With wisdom, with grace, with ease.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.936
Wild women have hurricanes
in their bellies,

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.856
releasing a flood of a lesson.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.136
Oh, wild women, they fly free.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.536
Just watch their ways,
how they rip and shred.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.416
Oh, who can understand her,

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.376
this winding Niger river of a woman

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.096
one who is unafraid to tear away

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.656
only to roam and then become the wind.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.176
She who speaks in gusts and cyclones

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.016
blasting us back to high ground,
high consciousness,

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.016
she turns and so does the world.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.416
Feel her spinning,

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.456
spanning several lifetimes.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.856
Hear her speaking, sparking alarm.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.776
See her dancing, summoning the dead,

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.616
resurrecting new life.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.736
Heaven hears her knocking on the door,

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.416
safely transporting the ones
who call for her assistance.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.176
Wild women, they open
portals to new worlds,

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.000
new speech, new dreams.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.056
Oh, dearly beloveds,

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.856
so dearly departed
from the ways of the guardian,

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.456
beware.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.560
For wild women are not to be tamed.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.200
Only admired.

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:23.520
Just let her in and witness her
set your days ablaze.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.296
(Cheers) (Applause)

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.536
Thank you.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.600
(Applause)
