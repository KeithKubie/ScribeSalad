00:00:01.251 --> 00:00:02.836
- Dude, this is

00:00:02.836 --> 00:00:04.754
So do you remember he said
he's got a bunch of stuff?

00:00:04.754 --> 00:00:06.631
I know I've been
waiting for this one.

00:00:06.631 --> 00:00:08.383
Ryan and I are
taking another trip

00:00:08.383 --> 00:00:11.302
over to our good friend, Dean
Pickles, for some inspiration.

00:00:11.302 --> 00:00:13.847
The whole family knows
how to do cars up right.

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:15.849
I can't wait to see what
they've got going on now.

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:17.100
Yeah, dude.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.435
That is your welcoming
car right there.

00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:21.104
Dude, already old
school Lincoln Mark 3.

00:00:21.104 --> 00:00:22.522
And, dude, what is this?

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:23.523
Whoa.

00:00:23.523 --> 00:00:25.316
I don't know what that is.

00:00:25.316 --> 00:00:28.445
I'm telling you right now,
if someone said, what is it?

00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:30.447
My first answer
is, I don't know.

00:00:30.447 --> 00:00:35.160
My second answer
is, maybe a Citroen?

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.745
Look at the doors.

00:00:36.745 --> 00:00:40.290
Reverse suicide and standing.
- They open this way?

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.125
They open this way.

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:43.334
I've never seen that before.

00:00:43.334 --> 00:00:44.711
That's too cool.

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:46.588
Look at this, man.

00:00:46.588 --> 00:00:47.547
Oh, this if four wheel drive.

00:00:47.547 --> 00:00:48.423
There's no hump.

00:00:48.423 --> 00:00:49.507
No hump in the floor.

00:00:49.507 --> 00:00:50.467
It is, yeah.

00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:51.509
What's up, fellas?

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:52.761
I'm going to get--

00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:55.180
what's happening, my man?
- It's good.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.681
Good to see you, man.
- How are you, man?

00:00:56.681 --> 00:00:57.974
Thank you for
having us out here.

00:00:57.974 --> 00:00:58.808
Hey, Ryan.
How you been?

00:00:58.808 --> 00:00:59.893
Appreciate it, man.

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:02.353
Bro, I've got to
ask, what is it?

00:01:02.353 --> 00:01:04.898
That's a '47 Citroen.

00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:05.940
He shoots, he scores.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:06.816
You've got to be kidding me.

00:01:06.816 --> 00:01:07.650
French cars, really?

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.277
You know those too.

00:01:09.277 --> 00:01:10.069
Oui.

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:12.280
[laughter]

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.617
The Citroen Company began by
building armaments for France

00:01:15.617 --> 00:01:17.952
during World War I but
quickly switched over

00:01:17.952 --> 00:01:19.704
to cars in the post-war era.

00:01:19.704 --> 00:01:22.332
They soon became known for the
revolutionary lightweight cars

00:01:22.332 --> 00:01:25.960
with unitary body, no separate
frame, and front wheel drive,

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.755
or as the French called
it, traction avant.

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:30.423
During the Second
World War, Citroen

00:01:30.423 --> 00:01:31.966
suffered extreme losses.

00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:33.468
The factory was bombed twice.

00:01:33.468 --> 00:01:35.595
And sales came to
a screeching halt.

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:37.639
But the company came
back stronger than ever.

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:41.851
And by 1947, it was back to
pre-war production levels.

00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:42.936
A Citroen.

00:01:42.936 --> 00:01:44.354
OK.
- Yeah.

00:01:44.354 --> 00:01:45.772
That's what I'm trying
to wrap my mind around.

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:46.773
Exactly.

00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:48.858
Where, when, what, and why?

00:01:48.858 --> 00:01:50.777
Just because I'm like you.

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:53.780
I like unique, different
things that you can't find.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.198
And you don't ever see
these in the states.

00:01:55.198 --> 00:01:56.115
How long have you had it?

00:01:56.115 --> 00:01:58.409
About a year now.

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.285
From where?

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:01.120
It came out Arizona.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.831
And the gentleman
that I bought it from

00:02:02.831 --> 00:02:05.750
had it shipped from
overseas to here.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.585
Wow.
So he had it when it was nice?

00:02:07.585 --> 00:02:09.671
- Yes.
- Like a running, driving car.

00:02:09.671 --> 00:02:10.922
Yeah, he had it
when it was nice.

00:02:10.922 --> 00:02:12.090
Yeah.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.258
Dean, let me
ask you this, bro,

00:02:13.258 --> 00:02:14.801
what in the world
are you planning

00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:17.846
on doing with a '47 Citroen?

00:02:17.846 --> 00:02:19.055
It's on the back burner.

00:02:19.055 --> 00:02:20.515
It's on--
[laughter]

00:02:20.515 --> 00:02:21.558
Impulse buy.

00:02:21.558 --> 00:02:23.101
I've got some of those too.

00:02:23.101 --> 00:02:24.060
- I know how that works.
- You've got a few of those.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.478
I've got a few of those.

00:02:25.478 --> 00:02:26.938
I've got about 5 more
Mustangs to do first.

00:02:26.938 --> 00:02:28.022
- All right.
- Yeah.

00:02:28.022 --> 00:02:29.149
More Mustangs?
Wow.

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:30.108
Yeah, more Mustangs.

00:02:30.108 --> 00:02:31.442
Well, let's take a look.

00:02:31.442 --> 00:02:32.777
Let's see what you're
hiding back here.

00:02:32.777 --> 00:02:34.696
Just a little
bit of everything.

00:02:34.696 --> 00:02:36.656
Just got like a
little overflow here.

00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:37.866
What are you hiding in there?

00:02:37.866 --> 00:02:40.577
This is a '72 Mach 1 Mustang.

00:02:40.577 --> 00:02:43.955
Oh, man, what a beautiful car.

00:02:43.955 --> 00:02:46.082
Dean's collection is
always a treat, man.

00:02:46.082 --> 00:02:47.709
And today has been no exception.

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.545
But I can't wait to find out
more about this Mach One.

00:02:50.545 --> 00:02:52.672
I've got to tell you this
thing is just stunning.

00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:53.840
Thanks, Danny.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.466
You guys always
do beautiful work.

00:02:55.466 --> 00:02:57.969
And I love how the backs of
these things just lay out.

00:02:57.969 --> 00:02:59.512
The window is this
being big, right?

00:02:59.512 --> 00:03:00.805
Yeah.

00:03:00.805 --> 00:03:01.806
But you only see
that much out of it.

00:03:01.806 --> 00:03:03.141
Yeah.

00:03:03.141 --> 00:03:04.726
It's like a mail
slot that's this big.

00:03:04.726 --> 00:03:07.061
What are you going to put in
this for drive train, bro?

00:03:07.061 --> 00:03:10.106
It's got the 351 Cleveland
that's going in it.

00:03:10.106 --> 00:03:12.275
But you know we need
to always go faster.

00:03:12.275 --> 00:03:13.526
What did you do?

00:03:13.526 --> 00:03:16.070
- Stroked it out to a 408.
- Really?

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.988
408?

00:03:16.988 --> 00:03:18.031
Yeah, ti's got the--

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:18.865
Oh, this is her laying here.

00:03:18.865 --> 00:03:20.116
This is it right here.

00:03:20.116 --> 00:03:21.326
She's already been dinoed.

00:03:21.326 --> 00:03:23.202
She dinoed out at
520 horse power.

00:03:23.202 --> 00:03:25.663
Ooh.

00:03:25.663 --> 00:03:26.664
Yes.

00:03:26.664 --> 00:03:27.832
This thing's going to rock.

00:03:27.832 --> 00:03:28.833
Yeah, it's going to fly.

00:03:28.833 --> 00:03:30.209
What else do you got here?

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.046
We've got a 1928 Model A Ford.

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:34.797
It's beautiful.

00:03:34.797 --> 00:03:37.800
The Model A was Henry Ford's
follow up to his original Model

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.053
T. With its 40
horsepower engine,

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:43.640
this baby could push a top
speed of 65 miles per hour.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.558
Slow by today's
standards, but that's

00:03:45.558 --> 00:03:49.020
nearly double the speed of the
Model T. The sportier Model A's

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.521
initially sold great.

00:03:50.521 --> 00:03:53.358
But by 1932, its last
year of production, sales

00:03:53.358 --> 00:03:56.569
had plummeted due to the
ongoing Great Depression.

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:59.322
- This one here is all original.
- It's all stock?

00:03:59.322 --> 00:04:00.114
The original owner.

00:04:00.114 --> 00:04:00.949
What?

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:02.992
He was still alive.

00:04:02.992 --> 00:04:05.662
So you are the second
owner of this car?

00:04:05.662 --> 00:04:06.746
Yeah.

00:04:06.746 --> 00:04:08.456
Bro, that's as
rare as it gets.

00:04:08.456 --> 00:04:09.749
Stuff like that
doesn't happen.

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:10.917
What kind of
shape was it in when

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:11.960
you got it from this gentleman?

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:12.877
Just like this.

00:04:12.877 --> 00:04:13.628
You're kidding me?

00:04:13.628 --> 00:04:15.254
Yes.

00:04:15.254 --> 00:04:16.798
Most of these things are
either turned into hot rods

00:04:16.798 --> 00:04:18.883
or cut up, or they're
garbage by now.

00:04:18.883 --> 00:04:22.595
So to see one pure and original
like this, this is gorgeous.

00:04:22.595 --> 00:04:24.681
Look at this
little tiny engine.

00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:26.808
Yeah, it ain't like what
you guys are used to seeing.

00:04:26.808 --> 00:04:28.226
[laughter]

00:04:28.226 --> 00:04:29.894
They make sewing
machine bigger than that.

00:04:29.894 --> 00:04:30.979
Little four cylinder.

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:32.271
Oh, Dean, I love it.

00:04:32.271 --> 00:04:33.898
What a neat car.
- Yeah, it is.

00:04:33.898 --> 00:04:35.441
Every time we get to see you.

00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:37.610
Bro, you inspire us, man.
- Thanks, Danny.

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.612
Thank you for letting
us see this stuff.

00:04:39.612 --> 00:04:40.613
I can't wait to see this
Mustang when it's done.
