in southern England it

00:17:37.919 --> 00:17:37.929
in southern England it
 

00:17:37.929 --> 00:17:41.549
in southern England it
it is clearly a major factor and here's

00:17:41.549 --> 00:17:41.559
it is clearly a major factor and here's
 

00:17:41.559 --> 00:17:44.879
it is clearly a major factor and here's
the third example fine particles high in

and so if we took away and we put a lot
 

00:17:51.129 --> 00:17:53.249
and so if we took away and we put a lot
of fine particles up there from the

my back then we would this would unmask

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:03.190
my back then we would this would unmask
 

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:07.350

some warming so we did an analysis also

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:07.360
some warming so we did an analysis also

with 24 leading aerosol physicists and

00:18:12.379 --> 00:18:12.389
with 24 leading aerosol physicists and
 

00:18:12.389 --> 00:18:15.659
with 24 leading aerosol physicists and
these things are our box plots that show

00:18:15.659 --> 00:18:15.669
these things are our box plots that show
 

00:18:15.669 --> 00:18:18.149

the amount of forcing down is cooling
 

00:18:18.159 --> 00:18:20.639
the amount of forcing down is cooling
and then the red bar up is the estimate

00:18:20.639 --> 00:18:20.649
and then the red bar up is the estimate
 

00:18:20.649 --> 00:18:23.340
and then the red bar up is the estimate
of how much warming is being contributed

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:23.350
of how much warming is being contributed
 

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:27.649
of how much warming is being contributed
by carbon dioxide and you can see that

00:18:27.649 --> 00:18:27.659
by carbon dioxide and you can see that
 

00:18:27.659 --> 00:18:30.989
by carbon dioxide and you can see that
if you look at the at the the open dots

00:18:30.989 --> 00:18:30.999
if you look at the at the the open dots
 

00:18:30.999 --> 00:18:33.840
if you look at the at the the open dots
in the cooling you can see that there's

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:33.850
in the cooling you can see that there's
 

00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:35.789
in the cooling you can see that there's
probably quite a lot of worming being

00:18:35.789 --> 00:18:35.799
probably quite a lot of worming being
 

00:18:35.799 --> 00:18:40.710
probably quite a lot of worming being

now that suggests that the Arctic Ocean

00:18:58.710 --> 00:18:58.720
now that suggests that the Arctic Ocean
 

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:01.080
now that suggests that the Arctic Ocean
may be completely free of sea ice by the

up against northern Greenland and that's
 

00:19:26.139 --> 00:19:28.080
up against northern Greenland and that's
important because if that goes away then

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:28.090
important because if that goes away then
 

00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:29.909
important because if that goes away then
that will result in even further warming

00:19:29.909 --> 00:19:29.919
that will result in even further warming

going to take a seventy eighty ninety

00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:19.040

so we're talking about big moves on

00:32:27.610 --> 00:32:27.620
so we're talking about big moves on
 

00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:30.960
so we're talking about big moves on
small moves and that is one of the key

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:30.970
small moves and that is one of the key
 

00:32:30.970 --> 00:32:35.440
small moves and that is one of the key

00:36:36.809 --> 00:36:38.180
weren't here at that and I wanted to
spend a little more time on this because

00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:38.190
spend a little more time on this because
 

00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:40.339
spend a little more time on this because
it's probably the one that might be

it's probably the one that might be
 

00:36:40.349 --> 00:36:42.410
it's probably the one that might be
least familiar to you because it's been

00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:42.420
least familiar to you because it's been
 

00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:45.920

pretty cheap to get out and so what they
 

00:44:19.789 --> 00:44:21.279
pretty cheap to get out and so what they
do is they take it out of places like

00:44:21.279 --> 00:44:21.289
do is they take it out of places like
 

00:44:21.289 --> 00:44:23.109

there what's going to do to me we can
 

00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:42.120
there what's going to do to me we can
talk about that in the discussion bottom

00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:42.130
talk about that in the discussion bottom
 

00:47:42.130 --> 00:47:44.610
talk about that in the discussion bottom
line though is that the longer it stays

00:47:44.610 --> 00:47:44.620
line though is that the longer it stays
 

00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:46.560
line though is that the longer it stays
on the ground the safer it is and the

00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:46.570
on the ground the safer it is and the
 

00:47:46.570 --> 00:47:47.850
on the ground the safer it is and the
longer it's going to stay there because

00:47:47.850 --> 00:47:47.860
longer it's going to stay there because
 

00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:51.720
longer it's going to stay there because

the brackish briny waters and over
 

00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:55.530
the brackish briny waters and over
longer periods of time it actually turns

00:47:55.530 --> 00:47:55.540
longer periods of time it actually turns
 

00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:59.070
longer periods of time it actually turns
into rock into carbonate rocks so it has

00:47:59.070 --> 00:47:59.080
into rock into carbonate rocks so it has
 

00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:00.570

right that era is over and we have to
 

00:52:49.690 --> 00:52:51.570
right that era is over and we have to
plan for future where energy is going to

battery in a car that will take the car
 

01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:27.720
battery in a car that will take the car
of 30 miles that will save two thirds of

01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:27.730
of 30 miles that will save two thirds of
 

01:00:27.730 --> 01:00:31.290
of 30 miles that will save two thirds of
the fuel that you use right thing is

01:00:31.290 --> 01:00:31.300
the fuel that you use right thing is
 

01:00:31.300 --> 01:00:33.210
the fuel that you use right thing is
that homes all the trips we make in the

01:00:33.210 --> 01:00:33.220
that homes all the trips we make in the
 

01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:35.970
that homes all the trips we make in the
united states are about 10 miles and we

01:00:35.970 --> 01:00:35.980
united states are about 10 miles and we
 

01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:38.420
united states are about 10 miles and we
drive our cars about 30 miles a day and

01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:38.430
drive our cars about 30 miles a day and
 

01:00:38.430 --> 01:00:40.980
drive our cars about 30 miles a day and
so if you have this 30-mile battery we

01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:40.990
so if you have this 30-mile battery we
 

01:00:40.990 --> 01:00:41.380
so if you have this 30-mile battery we
can

01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:41.390
can
 

01:00:41.390 --> 01:00:44.020
can
two-thirds of the fuel which means if we

01:00:44.020 --> 01:00:44.030
two-thirds of the fuel which means if we
 

01:00:44.030 --> 01:00:45.910
two-thirds of the fuel which means if we
had these plug-in hybrids that we would

01:00:45.910 --> 01:00:45.920
had these plug-in hybrids that we would
 

01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:47.830
had these plug-in hybrids that we would
need only 50 million gallons of ethanol

01:00:47.830 --> 01:00:47.840
need only 50 million gallons of ethanol
 

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:50.350
need only 50 million gallons of ethanol
a year we can easily do that not with

01:00:50.350 --> 01:00:50.360
a year we can easily do that not with
 

01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:53.140
a year we can easily do that not with
corn corn is a big mistake but we can do

01:00:53.140 --> 01:00:53.150
corn corn is a big mistake but we can do
 

01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:55.870
corn corn is a big mistake but we can do
that with cellulose to cathun all enthan

01:00:55.870 --> 01:00:55.880
that with cellulose to cathun all enthan
 

01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:58.090
that with cellulose to cathun all enthan
all made from wood chips from grasses

01:00:58.090 --> 01:00:58.100
all made from wood chips from grasses
 

01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:03.580
all made from wood chips from grasses
and so on and we can do that relatively

01:01:03.580 --> 01:01:03.590
and so on and we can do that relatively
 

01:01:03.590 --> 01:01:05.950
and so on and we can do that relatively
inexpensively what if you're going to do

01:01:05.950 --> 01:01:05.960
inexpensively what if you're going to do
 

01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:09.250
inexpensively what if you're going to do
it then what we need to do is to have

01:01:09.250 --> 01:01:09.260
it then what we need to do is to have
 

01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:13.170
it then what we need to do is to have
some floor in the price of oil and

01:01:13.170 --> 01:01:13.180
some floor in the price of oil and
 

01:01:13.180 --> 01:01:16.900
some floor in the price of oil and
eighty dollars a barrel he is a floor

01:01:16.900 --> 01:01:16.910
eighty dollars a barrel he is a floor
 

01:01:16.910 --> 01:01:18.100
eighty dollars a barrel he is a floor
that would certainly work we're above

01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:18.110
that would certainly work we're above
 

01:01:18.110 --> 01:01:23.830
that would certainly work we're above
that now no big deal about that here's

01:01:23.830 --> 01:01:23.840
that now no big deal about that here's
 

01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:27.340
that now no big deal about that here's

is not a mild climate particularly all

01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:45.590
is not a mild climate particularly all
 

01:02:45.590 --> 01:02:48.280
is not a mild climate particularly all
right so so the point of this slide is

01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:48.290
right so so the point of this slide is
 

01:02:48.290 --> 01:02:50.230
right so so the point of this slide is
that there's a lot we can do in the

01:02:50.230 --> 01:02:50.240
that there's a lot we can do in the
 

01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:52.120
that there's a lot we can do in the
United States we would have to change

01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:52.130
United States we would have to change
 

01:02:52.130 --> 01:02:54.970
United States we would have to change
our lifestyles the gains have fewer cars

01:02:54.970 --> 01:02:54.980
our lifestyles the gains have fewer cars
 

01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:57.100
our lifestyles the gains have fewer cars
per capita the cars they have drives

01:02:57.100 --> 01:02:57.110
per capita the cars they have drives
 

01:02:57.110 --> 01:02:59.440
per capita the cars they have drives
fewer miles per year it can't believe

01:02:59.440 --> 01:02:59.450
fewer miles per year it can't believe
 

01:02:59.450 --> 01:03:00.850
fewer miles per year it can't believe
more in high-rise buildings that can

01:03:00.850 --> 01:03:00.860
more in high-rise buildings that can
 

01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:02.710
more in high-rise buildings that can
take a more public transportation and so

01:03:02.710 --> 01:03:02.720
take a more public transportation and so
 

01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:04.810
take a more public transportation and so
on those are certainly all things that

01:03:04.810 --> 01:03:04.820
on those are certainly all things that
 

01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:08.020
on those are certainly all things that
that way you do the point of this is

01:03:08.020 --> 01:03:08.030
that way you do the point of this is
 

01:03:08.030 --> 01:03:12.400
that way you do the point of this is
that just to sum up the first point is

01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:12.410
that just to sum up the first point is
 

01:03:12.410 --> 01:03:14.290
that just to sum up the first point is
that if we're going to do these things

01:03:14.290 --> 01:03:14.300
that if we're going to do these things
 

01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:16.540
that if we're going to do these things
we're talking about we need to pay a lot

01:03:16.540 --> 01:03:16.550
we're talking about we need to pay a lot
 

01:03:16.550 --> 01:03:20.050
we're talking about we need to pay a lot
of attention to what the costs are we

01:03:20.050 --> 01:03:20.060
of attention to what the costs are we
 

01:03:20.060 --> 01:03:22.150
of attention to what the costs are we
don't we will not be penalizing the

01:03:22.150 --> 01:03:22.160
don't we will not be penalizing the
 

01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:24.190
don't we will not be penalizing the
economy if we can do these in economic

01:03:24.190 --> 01:03:24.200
economy if we can do these in economic
 

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:27.340
economy if we can do these in economic
way and there are several ways in which

01:03:27.340 --> 01:03:27.350
way and there are several ways in which
 

01:03:27.350 --> 01:03:29.380
way and there are several ways in which
we can do them that are almost free at

01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:29.390
we can do them that are almost free at
 

01:03:29.390 --> 01:03:31.480
we can do them that are almost free at
the moment in terms of increasing

01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:31.490
the moment in terms of increasing
 

01:03:31.490 --> 01:03:34.480
the moment in terms of increasing
efficiency and then more generally if we

01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:34.490
efficiency and then more generally if we
 

01:03:34.490 --> 01:03:35.620
efficiency and then more generally if we
want to get our eighty percent

01:03:35.620 --> 01:03:35.630
want to get our eighty percent
 

01:03:35.630 --> 01:03:38.800
want to get our eighty percent
reductions which we can do then it's

01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:38.810
reductions which we can do then it's
 

01:03:38.810 --> 01:03:40.900
reductions which we can do then it's
going to take some lifestyle changes as

01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:40.910
going to take some lifestyle changes as
 

01:03:40.910 --> 01:03:44.770
going to take some lifestyle changes as
well and you know I'll then expose

01:03:44.770 --> 01:03:44.780
well and you know I'll then expose
 

01:03:44.780 --> 01:03:47.470
well and you know I'll then expose
myself to the world and say do you

01:03:47.470 --> 01:03:47.480
myself to the world and say do you
 

01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:49.900
myself to the world and say do you
really need to have one person driving a

01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:49.910
really need to have one person driving a
 

01:03:49.910 --> 01:03:53.770
really need to have one person driving a
hummer work right I mean if you look at

01:03:53.770 --> 01:03:53.780
hummer work right I mean if you look at
 

01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:56.170
hummer work right I mean if you look at
the highway about one part you can will

01:03:56.170 --> 01:03:56.180
the highway about one part you can will
 

01:03:56.180 --> 01:03:58.990
the highway about one part you can will
have more than one person in so do you

01:03:58.990 --> 01:03:59.000
have more than one person in so do you
 

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.420
have more than one person in so do you
need to have this this huge vehicle

01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:01.430
need to have this this huge vehicle
 

01:04:01.430 --> 01:04:02.570
need to have this this huge vehicle
6,000 pounds

01:04:02.570 --> 01:04:02.580
6,000 pounds
 

01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:05.080
6,000 pounds
whatever is with one person inside

01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:05.090
whatever is with one person inside
 

01:04:05.090 --> 01:04:07.880
whatever is with one person inside
wouldn't it be just as well gift if you

01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:07.890
wouldn't it be just as well gift if you
 

01:04:07.890 --> 01:04:10.160
wouldn't it be just as well gift if you
had a Prius Akbar I've been in the back

01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:10.170
had a Prius Akbar I've been in the back
 

01:04:10.170 --> 01:04:11.840

seat as well as the throne Ziva prius

01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:11.850
seat as well as the throne Ziva prius
 

01:04:11.850 --> 01:04:14.870
seat as well as the throne Ziva prius
right suppose it that we have one person

01:04:14.870 --> 01:04:14.880
right suppose it that we have one person
 

01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:17.240
right suppose it that we have one person
for carving that would we be breaking

01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:17.250
for carving that would we be breaking
 

01:04:17.250 --> 01:04:20.390
for carving that would we be breaking
