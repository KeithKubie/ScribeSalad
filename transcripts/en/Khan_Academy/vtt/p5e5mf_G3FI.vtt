00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.210
We have the equation negative
16 is equal to x

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.190
over 4, plus 2.

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.880
And we need to solve for x.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.650
So we really just need to
isolate the x variable on one

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.045
side of this equation, and the
best way to do that is first

00:00:17.045 --> 00:00:20.885
to isolate it-- isolate this
whole x over 4 term from all

00:00:20.885 --> 00:00:22.870
of the other terms. So in order
to do that, let's get

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:23.700
rid of this 2.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.080
And the best way to get rid of
that 2 is to subtract it.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.470
But if we want to subtract it
from the right-hand side, we

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.880
also have to subtract it from
the left-hand side, because

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.530
this is an equation.

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.370
If this is equal to that,
anything we do to that, we

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.020
also have to do to this.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.540
So let's subtract 2
from both sides.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.140
So you subtract 2 from the
right, subtract 2 from the

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.240
left, and we get, on the
left-hand side, negative 16

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.300
minus 2 is negative 18.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.060
And then that is equal
to x over 4.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.650
And then we have positive 2
minus 2, which is just going

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.410
to be 0, so we don't even
have to write that.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.610
I could write just a plus 0,
but I think that's a little

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:05.660
unnecessary.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.720
And so we have negative 18
is equal to x over 4.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.020
And our whole goal here is
to isolate the x, to

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.020
solve for the x.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.480
And the best way we can do
that, if we have x over 4

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.770
here, if we multiply that
by 4, we're just

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:19.860
going to have an x.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.520
So we can multiply that
by 4, but once

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.680
again, this is an equation.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.290
Anything you do to the
right-hand side, you have to

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.120
do to the left-hand side,
and vice versa.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.450
So if we multiply the right-hand
side by 4, we also

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.850
have to multiply the left-hand
side by 4.

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.470
So we get 4 times negative 18 is
equal to x over 4, times 4.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.010
The x over 4 times 4,
that cancels out.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.820
You divide something by 4 and
multiply by 4, you're just

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.800
going to be left with an x.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.350
And on the other side,
4 times negative 18.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.760
Let's see, that's 40.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:53.990
Well, let's just write it out.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.490
So 18 times 4.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.450
If we were to multiply 18 times
4, 4 times 8 is 32.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.195
4 times 1 is 4, plus 1 is 72.

00:02:05.195 --> 00:02:09.660
But this is negative 18 times
4, so it's negative 72.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.370
So x is equal to negative 72.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.340
And if we want to check it, we
can just substitute it back

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.380
into that original equation.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.390
So let's do that.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.800
Let's substitute this into
the original equation.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.110
So the original equation was
negative 16 is equal to--

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.140
instead of writing x, I'm going
to write negative 72--

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:36.840
is equal to negative
72 over 4 plus 2.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.260
Let's see if this is
actually true.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.640
So this right-hand side
simplifies to negative 72

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.450
divided by 4.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.850
We already know that that
is negative 18.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.760
So this is equal to negative
18 plus 2.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.100
This is what the equation
becomes.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.010
And then the right-hand side,
negative 18 plus 2, that's

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.500
negative 16.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.670
So it all comes out true.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.910
This right-hand side, when x is
equal to negative 72, does

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.750
indeed equal negative 16.
