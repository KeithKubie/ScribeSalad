[APPLAUSE]

00:00:29.146 --> 00:00:30.628
GUEST SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:00:30.628 --> 00:00:32.122
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:32.122 --> 00:00:34.580
AUDIENCE: What [INAUDIBLE] did
you guys use different color

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.080
LEDs?

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.504
GUEST SPEAKER: We
used new pixel.

00:00:37.504 --> 00:00:38.800
AUDIENCE: To add the color?

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.644
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:00:39.644 --> 00:00:43.470
As well as a couple of
other ones and then we--

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:44.400
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.585
GUEST SPEAKER: Yep.

00:00:45.585 --> 00:00:46.960
AUDIENCE: I don't
know if this is

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.180
a question you guys
can answer, but do you

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.290
guys think that if the paper,
the surfaced in which things

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.910
are being projected
through or reflected

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.150
is either red, blue, or green,
could you hide some things

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:02.960
and show some others,
you know what I mean?

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.540
GUEST SPEAKER: To
an extent, I think.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.520
But it depends also what kind
of material you would use.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.450
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.908
GUEST SPEAKER: To
an extent, but it

00:01:10.908 --> 00:01:14.710
wouldn't be as effective
as basically using

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.110
the codes that turn on and off.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.460
[INAUDIBLE] Yeah.
