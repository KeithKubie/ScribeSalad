00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.960
Hey, whats up guys.

00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.800
Today we are back with our silicone brain molds

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.960
And today is the day we're making gummy brains.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.020
Now you remember in our last project we took silicone and poured it over real cows brains

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:15.100
Then we ripped the molds open, removed the brain, and then we sterilized the mold in a solution of bleach and dish soap for twelve hours.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.440
Today our molds are clean, ready for use, and here's what they look like now.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.480
Now you may be wondering how these molds smell after having cow brains in them, and I'm actually kind of wondering the same thing.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:25.740
*sniff sniff*

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.080
Pleasantly enough, they smell like bleach.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:37.300
They smell very very clean, and I've actually run a couple of batches of water through here and froze it so that anything that leeched into the silicone as well.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.600
So these should be safe enough for casting, at least safe enough for my purposes.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.180
I also premade a batch of purple and green gummy,

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.580
So all we have to do now is throw these things into the microwave to remelt them, pour them into the molds together;

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.160
So we can make some kind of purpulish - green gummy zombie brain.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.600
At least that's the idea

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:55.540
Now we wait

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.620
Alright, green is good, purple is next

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.080
We're going to throw that on for about two minutes.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.460
Oh yeah, purple is nice and molten.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.500
There's still a little bit of a chunk there in the center,

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.100
But there's enough heat in the rest of the liquid that it should completely melt that.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.240
Let's just let that sit out for a couple of minutes,

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.800
And work on preparing our molds.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.700
If you look closely here, I think that as we were soaking these in the bleach,

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.620
i think It actually kind of discolored the silicone.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.080
A little bit, we got purple tendencies on the edges of our mold.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.660
But that shouldn't affect the way our molds turn out.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.760
Now because these molds are so thick, they pretty much themselves together,

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:38.940
And if you look closely, when you push them together, almost all of the cracks and seams seem to line up perfectly, they almost virtually disappear.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:39.900
and thats a good thing.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.840
I'm just gonna use a little bit of electrical tap around the top here to hold everything together

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.560
so that as we pour our syrup

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.480
our molds will be gummy-tight

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.920
and prevent anything from leaking out

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.200
I pretty much use this stuff for everything and

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.640
I think about two wraps is all we're gonna need

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.100
the cleaner our mold, the cleaner our cast

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.520
there we go our mold is ready for pouring

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.380
so our green's been sitting out for a few minutes here

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.060
and come check this out if you look at the top layer it's actually start to cool

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.840
and it forms a little bit of a skin so any of those imperfections that were on the top before we can skim right out of there

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.120
and that leaves us with crystal clear gummy

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.340
so that can be transferred to my mouth

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.120
or the garbage

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.120
or where ever else you want

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:29.720
after right there will take the second

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.310
cooldown approaching skim the top I

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:32.930
thought now would be the perfect time to

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.250
address the suggestion that comes out of

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.739
the comments from Samhith Reddy V says

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:38.900
keep melted gummy in a vacuum chamber

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.090
and by that Samhith I assume you mean put

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.680
melted gummy in the vacuum chamber and

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.630
since we have melted gummy and vacuum

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.040
right here i'm gonna put the two

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.810
together for you right now so use a

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.340
couple extra glasses and just took some

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.720
samples of are gummy here you can see

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.160
it's already starting to harden up a

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.900
little bit so I'm interested to see what

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.459
effect that will do this is a little bit

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.290
colder and more like jelly this is a

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.879
little bit more liquid let's put both of

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:00.590
them inside our large glass vacuum

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.720
chamber put a lid on and suck it up to

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.360
25 microns alright let's do this there

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.920
we go got me in a vacuum chamber what to

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.959
do

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.500
the green one over here is moving just a

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.129
little bit got some bubbles rising at the top but it's a lot harder

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:22.860
syrup if I melt these things down a

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.010
little bit we might see more bubbling

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.470
oh here goes purple did you see that it just

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.510
took off like came out of nowhere just see that

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.650
erupted there goes again check that out

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.580
oh wow you know what I'm just gonna let

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.019
it bubble over what the heck why not

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.569
look at all the bubbles coming from the

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:43.319
bottom there

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.060
the green ones starting to bubble little

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.200
bit too so by now I think our gummy has

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.640
solidified let's just go ahead and open

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.970
it up take it out take a look at it and

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.209
look at this that is an interesting pattern

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.000
that spray pattern all the side of the

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.819
glass very interesting almost looks like

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:07.019
modern art kingofrandom style random happens guys

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:11.670
now be selling this on ebay to the higest bidder just joking I'm going to eat

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.060
it instead I love my job

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.130
alright two more glasses these are full ones

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.150
just came out of the microwave for

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.919
another 10 seconds let's put them in the

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.720
vacuum chamber and see how they react

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:27.240
wow that is making a royal mess

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.720
the purple is everywhere it's completely

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.950
covered the bottom of the vacuum chamber

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.500
the green going crazy but it's not

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.200
frosting like the purple is you see the purple

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.240
is just spilling stuff everywhere but the

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.530
green all the bubbles are being

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.570
extracted out and that's looking really

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:43.680
really good

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.450
the purple I think we like lost half of

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.560
our mixture all over the place there is foam

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.870
everywhere it's like purple bubble bath

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.300
now that's all the green I've got so I

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.310
can't waste that or it's going to cause great

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.070
problems later on so I think at this

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:00.360
point I'm going to turn off the

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.849
vacuum chamber what happens when you open it

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.200
oh my goodness did you see the color

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.050
change there it was kinda like when we

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.760
did slime in the vacuum chamber all the

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.830
color came back into it

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.930
oh wow look down inside there like the

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.880
bottom that was all bubbles has now just

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.670
turned into a gelatinous blob of

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.340
volcanic gummy eruption when I

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:24.330
was watching things in the vacuum

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:25.800
chamber just seems like the bubbles are

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.690
like cycling up and down I didn't really seen

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.670
them popping too much and if we did get

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:30.870
them to the point of foaming and

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.040
frothing they just came out of the glass

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.090
and make a mess everywhere

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.590
Wow

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.110
ok that's cool simultaneously removing

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.000
the heat and the bubbles

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.470
oh look at that ok we had some success

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:53.310
with that one

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.840
ok so this is a little bit of a

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.520
different experience using really hot

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.020
gummy syrup we got a really nice

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.570
reaction the bubble seamed to have come out

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:03.060
that is crystal clear and not only that

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.400
the surface is smooth and clear as well

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.940
so molten like really hot demonstrated

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.260
in a vacuum chamber is great and the cool

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.060
thing is he pulled out some of the heat

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:13.800
as well so this is cool down process

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.450
brilliant idea

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:18.600
let's pour it here's what I'm thinking

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.760
let's pour the green gummy and first and

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.410
rotate to mold around in all different

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:24.660
directions to coat the surface of the

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.330
mold with green gummy after the green has

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:28.860
solidified we can pour the purple gummy

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:30.810
in when the whole thing set hopefully

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:32.400
we'll get some kind of eerie greenish

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.650
purple gummi zombie brain they look

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:37.920
awesome and taste even better all the

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.480
gummy solidified to the surface it's

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.490
like silicon but you can eat it

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:47.640
the best part that's pretty much it guys

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.500
are gummy brains are now completely

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.300
poured and we've got gummy green and

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.280
gummy purple combining to make some kind

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.780
of awesomeness I hope

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:56.160
how do you think our zombie brains gonna

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.720
turn out we're gonna find out in the

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:58.980
next video because these things need to

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:00.660
sit in the fridge for 24 hours in order

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.670
to firm up properly but until then

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:03.900
thanks for joining for this project

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.250
today guys it was cool hanging out with

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:06.450
you i'll be looking for you in the next

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:11.040
video. My gloves are so sticky

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.240
I think I'm gonna take them off
