00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The answer is that they must be similar.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
They absolutely have to be.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The reason is that even though

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I only explicitly gave you two angles--

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
the fact that this is a right angle

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and that this is 22.6 degrees--

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
we also know that the angles of a triangle

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
must sum up to 180 degrees.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Well, what number adds to 90 and 22.6

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
to give you 180?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
That's 57.4 degrees.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So, both this angle and this angle are 57.4 degrees.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Since that means that these triangles both have

00:00:34.000 --> 99:59:59.000
the exact same three angles, they must be similar.
