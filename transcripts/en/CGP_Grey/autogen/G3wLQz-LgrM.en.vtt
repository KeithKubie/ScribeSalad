00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.040
 Hello, Internet. 

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:03.620
 Let's talk about this map, this discussion, 

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.680
 and on the electoral college in general. 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.780
 In my video "Problems with the electoral college" of 2011, 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.160
 I made a mistake by using the city limits as part of the discussion 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.820
 instead of the most extensive metropolitan area. 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.660
 The scholar in my interior continues to tell me that "this is a technically correct" section. 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.700
 I used the municipal boundaries because metropolitan areas are often vague and absurdly large: 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.120
 The metropolitan area of ​​New York is 6700+ mi² in four states 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.160
 and from where I grew up, it seemed that much of this area 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.640
 It had nothing to do with the city of New York. 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.820
 That is why, at that time, I ignored the metropolitan borders. 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.200
 But using the municipal limits strictly in that video was a mistaken decision in the retro-view. 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.860
 In addition to being a bad argument to do, 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.540
 above all did not address the problems that this map represents. 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.900
 And that's right! Half of the population lives in counts in gray. 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:03.420
 And in addition, the map teaches the fundamental division between the United States and other countries 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.000
 which is translated partly into the policies we see: 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.980
 the difference between rural and urban areas. 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.680
 If the trend continues, an increasing percentage of the country will live in urban areas. 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.980
 In another eight or sixteen years, this map will still be more extreme: 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.460
 the metropolitan areas will be even more dense. 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.960
 What if you are in favor of the electoral college, 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.880
 There will be another reason to keep it. 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.460
 Now is when we have to discuss the idea that the electoral college 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.480
 Ensures that the president is chosen by the states. 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:34.540
 It does not. 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.820
 A candidate can win the polling school with only the eleven larger states. 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.860
 This collection may seem implausible, but as urbanization and the policies that take place continue, 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.060
 every time seems more plausible. 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.800
 The electoral college does not assure that the president wins with many states, 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.100
 not even with geographically diverse states. 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.500
 Now, "Should the president represent the citizens, or should he represent the states?" 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.880
 It is an unanswered question. 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.340
 It treats preferences about the style of government. 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.300
 One transfers the power to the federal level, while the other moves it to the states. 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.900
 And given the size of the country and the difference of its geographies, 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.980
 It is reasonable to think that increasing the power of states is the best 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.420
 And the least divisive solution to the problem of governance. 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.940
 But the electoral college does not help in that. 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.100
 The last results have been geographically dispersed, 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.680
 but the electoral college does not guarantee this result. 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.300
 Blind everyone in California, leaving only one person in each state 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.700
 and the polling station will say: "California alone decides." 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.240
 We could have a system in which the president must win a majority of states, 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.340
 Which is what the electoral college is in some way ... but it is not. 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.020
 The choice only makes it look. 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.080
 The protection of the electoral college is only an illusion. 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.440
 Although I still like the electoral college, 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.900
 Although it does not really protect the small states, 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.300
 the electoral college comes with the bitter anti-republican pill. 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.520
 Although you win the election in November, 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.660
 You can get rid of the victory in December. 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.740
 The votes that are collected by the electoral college are not really votes, 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.820
 but individual members of political parties, 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.540
 which carry out the real vote by the president in December. 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.520
 No citizen has voted to these elect to vote in his name, 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.520
 and many of them are free to vote for anyone who wants to. 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.520
 Your choice in December is the real choice. 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.460
 The electoral college was designed to overwrite the will of the people, 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.840
 or of its own electoral process, 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.880
 at any time that a small number of people unknown from the party and who have not been chosen 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.260
 They do not like the result they have taken. 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.380
 If you are in favor of the electoral college, 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.380
 you must accept it, by its own rules, 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.260
 you can take away the victory 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.860
 under the guise of wanting to protect yourself. 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.800
 It has never happened in American history, nor should it ever. 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.120
 But it is crazy to leave for future elections 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.200
 a system that does not benefit the citizens 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.080
 and it does not protect any state. 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.800
 It's time to get rid of the polling station and have a real discussion about 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.580
 As a government and a modern election must be carried out.
