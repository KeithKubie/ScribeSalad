00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.730
The opposite of 10 is -10.

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.528
When we add the opposite of 10
to 6 we are adding -10 to 6 and

00:00:07.528 --> 00:00:11.800
we get -4.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.923
We originally wrote this as 6-10,
but we can also write

00:00:16.923 --> 00:00:22.530
it as 6+-10 and
treat it like an addition problem.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.790
Sometimes just to keep things
neat we'll put parentheses

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.070
around a negative number
that we're adding.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.560
Don't let these parentheses confuse you.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.345
These two expressions are equivalent.

00:00:33.345 --> 00:00:36.189
