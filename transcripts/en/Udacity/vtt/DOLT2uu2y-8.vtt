00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.062
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; If you took a break, welcome back. We've been talking a lot about lines and

00:00:04.062 --> 00:00:08.212
slopes and intercepts. And well, who cares? What good are these lines and

00:00:08.212 --> 00:00:12.489
equations anyway? It turns out we can use them. For example, let's say we're

00:00:12.489 --> 00:00:16.732
moving and we need to rent a truck to haul all of our stuff. I looked up prices

00:00:16.732 --> 00:00:21.345
to do this. And I found that doing this requires us to pay an initial fee of

00:00:21.345 --> 00:00:25.940
$20, plus $2 per mile. So, if I don't drive the truck at all, I still have to

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.649
pay $20 just to get the keys. I'm going to list the dollar sign here, instead of

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:35.238
the table for each value. So, if we rented this truck and drove it one mile, it

00:00:35.238 --> 00:00:39.985
would have cost $20 plus $2 for the extra mile. So that's $22 in total. Based on

00:00:39.985 --> 00:00:44.725
this price structure, how much would it cost to drive the truck 2 miles, 3

00:00:44.725 --> 00:00:49.351
miles, and 4 miles? Put your answers in each of these boxes.
