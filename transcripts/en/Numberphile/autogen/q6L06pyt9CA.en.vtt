plus 1 divide that by 6 so for a stack

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210
plus 1 divide that by 6 so for a stack
 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.750
plus 1 divide that by 6 so for a stack
of cannonballs in high that's how many

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760
of cannonballs in high that's how many
 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.070
of cannonballs in high that's how many
cannonballs you've got in there and

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080
cannonballs you've got in there and
 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.330
cannonballs you've got in there and
people look to that for a while went

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340
people look to that for a while went
 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.039
people look to that for a while went
okay that's kind of fun after Rayleigh

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049
okay that's kind of fun after Rayleigh
 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.260
okay that's kind of fun after Rayleigh
had done his work people were like well

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270
had done his work people were like well
 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.830

that's a square base pyramid what if

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840
that's a square base pyramid what if
 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.660
that's a square base pyramid what if
they were just in a square I said like a

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670
they were just in a square I said like a
 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.210
they were just in a square I said like a
cube just like a big old flat square on

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220
cube just like a big old flat square on
 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.700
cube just like a big old flat square on
the ground and so people said the one

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710
the ground and so people said the one
 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.890
the ground and so people said the one
that were hang on hang on can you find

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900
that were hang on hang on can you find
 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.499
that were hang on hang on can you find
some other number squared which gives

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509
some other number squared which gives
 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.690
some other number squared which gives
you a square base pyramid this is it

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700
you a square base pyramid this is it
 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.999
you a square base pyramid this is it
4900 so this was in 1875 Lucas of Lucas

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009
4900 so this was in 1875 Lucas of Lucas
 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.740
4900 so this was in 1875 Lucas of Lucas
number Fame what a guy

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750
number Fame what a guy
 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.420
number Fame what a guy
best numbers and that's why I think the

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430
best numbers and that's why I think the
 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.210
best numbers and that's why I think the
Lucas numbers are vastly superior

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220
Lucas numbers are vastly superior
 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.560
Lucas numbers are vastly superior
Fibonacci did nothing on this right

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570
Fibonacci did nothing on this right
 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.700
Fibonacci did nothing on this right
Lucas found 4900 which can be a

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710
Lucas found 4900 which can be a
 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.760
Lucas found 4900 which can be a
cannonball stack so like James showed

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770
cannonball stack so like James showed
 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.469
cannonball stack so like James showed
you could take these and put them in a

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479
you could take these and put them in a
 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.319
you could take these and put them in a
square based pyramid 24 layers high

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329
square based pyramid 24 layers high
 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.230
square based pyramid 24 layers high
perfect square based pyramid or you

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240
perfect square based pyramid or you
 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.330
perfect square based pyramid or you
could arrange them into a giant square

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340
could arrange them into a giant square
 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.319
could arrange them into a giant square
70 by 70 flat and it turns out it's the

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329
70 by 70 flat and it turns out it's the
 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.839
70 by 70 flat and it turns out it's the
only number that can do that how

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849
only number that can do that how
 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:09.559
only number that can do that how
exciting is that

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569
exciting is that
 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.930
exciting is that
right so and it wasn't proved until

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940
right so and it wasn't proved until
 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.800
right so and it wasn't proved until

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130
18 someone managed to prove 4900 is the
 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.210
18 someone managed to prove 4900 is the
only number which can be both a square

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220
only number which can be both a square
 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.820
only number which can be both a square
and a square based pyramid which is why

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830
and a square based pyramid which is why
 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.520
and a square based pyramid which is why
it's called the cannonball number cool

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530
it's called the cannonball number cool
 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.160
it's called the cannonball number cool
the next question should be are there

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170
the next question should be are there
 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.740
the next question should be are there
any others right because I've just said

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750
any others right because I've just said
 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.350
any others right because I've just said
it's the only square and square based

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360
it's the only square and square based
 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.180
it's the only square and square based
pyramid well then why would there be a

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190
pyramid well then why would there be a
 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.670
pyramid well then why would there be a
question of are there any others you've

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680
question of are there any others you've
 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.350
question of are there any others you've
told me there's no other showed us there

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360
told me there's no other showed us there
 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.880
told me there's no other showed us there
are other ways to stack things you can

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890
are other ways to stack things you can
 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.580
are other ways to stack things you can
have different based pyramids when I

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590
have different based pyramids when I
 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.920
have different based pyramids when I
first saw this big final Lukas I was

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930
first saw this big final Lukas I was
 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:46.670
first saw this big final Lukas I was
like oh that's great

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680
like oh that's great
 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.259

really cool can you favorite number for

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269
really cool can you favorite number for
 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.870
really cool can you favorite number for
a while and I was like wow what about

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880
a while and I was like wow what about
 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.920
a while and I was like wow what about
other based pyramids so I wrote a little

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930
other based pyramids so I wrote a little
 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.750
other based pyramids so I wrote a little
computer program because I mean this one

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760
computer program because I mean this one
 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.180
computer program because I mean this one
is easy enough there's your formula

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190
is easy enough there's your formula
 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.620
is easy enough there's your formula
which will give you number of

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630
which will give you number of
 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:01.970
which will give you number of
cannonballs and a stack of a certain

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980
cannonballs and a stack of a certain
 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.949
cannonballs and a stack of a certain
height that's the formula for the area

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959
height that's the formula for the area
 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.720
height that's the formula for the area
of a square very straightforward there

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730
of a square very straightforward there
 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.789
of a square very straightforward there
are more complicated formulas for the

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799
are more complicated formulas for the
 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:11.059
are more complicated formulas for the
area of a pentagon or a hexagon or an

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069
area of a pentagon or a hexagon or an
 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.520
area of a pentagon or a hexagon or an
octagon of cannonballs the pyramid is

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530
octagon of cannonballs the pyramid is
 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.160

just sequential adding up all of those

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170
just sequential adding up all of those
 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.930
just sequential adding up all of those
numbers in a row so what this number

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940
numbers in a row so what this number
 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.640
numbers in a row so what this number
actually is it's the only square number

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650
actually is it's the only square number
 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.460
actually is it's the only square number
which is also the sum of the sequence of

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470
which is also the sum of the sequence of
 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.560
which is also the sum of the sequence of
square numbers starting at 1 so I was

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570
square numbers starting at 1 so I was
 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.410
square numbers starting at 1 so I was
looking for other shape numbers whatever

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420
looking for other shape numbers whatever
 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.780
looking for other shape numbers whatever
argon numbers which are also the some of

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790
argon numbers which are also the some of
 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.849
argon numbers which are also the some of
those same argon numbers starting from

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859
those same argon numbers starting from
 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:34.430
those same argon numbers starting from
one same shape all the way my hope is

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440
one same shape all the way my hope is
 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.970
one same shape all the way my hope is
that for each shape and its accompanying

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980
that for each shape and its accompanying
 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.000
that for each shape and its accompanying
pyramid there's a one number for each

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010
pyramid there's a one number for each
 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.640
pyramid there's a one number for each
wouldn't it be great ok Pentagon's

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650
wouldn't it be great ok Pentagon's
 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.629
wouldn't it be great ok Pentagon's
none well I can't prove there a number I

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:47.639
none well I can't prove there a number I
 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:49.640
none well I can't prove there a number I
