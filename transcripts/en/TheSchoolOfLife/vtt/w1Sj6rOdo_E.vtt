00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:07.859
Knowing our own minds is difficult at the
best of times. It is extraordinarily hard

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.980
to secure even basic insights into our characters
and motivations – of a kind that we hope

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.770
can free us from some of the neuroses and
compulsions that spoil so much of our lives.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:26.350
It is therefore especially humbling and at
moments truly dispiriting to realise that

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:33.660
dispelling ignorance of our psyches with knowledge
isn’t going to be enough by itself. Or rather,

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.830
we stand to realise that there is going to
need to be a further and yet more arduous

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:43.290
distinction to observe between knowing something
about ourselves intellectually and knowing

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:50.190
about it emotionally. We might, for example,
come to an intellectual understanding that

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.570
we are timid around figures of authority because
our father was a remote and distant figure

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.960
who didn’t give us some of the support and
love we needed to tolerate ourselves. Assembling

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.350
this insight into our characters might be
the work of many years and, having reached

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:12.690
it, we could reasonably expect that our problems
with timidity and authority would then abate.

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:19.780
But the mind’s knots are sadly not so simple
to unpick. An intellectual understanding of

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:25.450
the past, though not wrong, won’t by itself
be effective in the sense of being able to

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:31.380
release us from the true intensity of our
neurotic symptoms. For this, we have to edge

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.341
our way towards a far more close-up, detailed,
visceral appreciation of where we have come

00:01:37.341 --> 00:01:43.810
from and what we have suffered. We need to
strive for what we can call an emotional understanding

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:50.520
of the past – as opposed to a top-down,
abbreviated intellectual one. We will have

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.990
to re-experience at a novelistic level of
detail a whole set of scenes from our early

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.409
life in which our problems around fathers
and authority were formed. We will need to

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.470
let our imaginations wonder back to certain
moments that have been too unbearable to keep

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:13.270
alive in a three-dimensional form in our active
memories (the mind liking, unless actively

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:19.120
prompted, to reduce most of what we’ve been
through to headings rather than the full story,

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.430
a document which it shelves in remote locations
of the inner library). We need not only to

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.730
know that we had a difficult relationship
with our father, we need to relive the sorrow

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.930
as if it were happening to us today. We need
to be back in his book lined study when we

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.660
would have been not more than six; we need
to remember the light coming in from the garden,

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.599
the corduroy trousers we were wearing, the
sound of our father’s voice as it reached

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:50.840
its pitch of heightened anxiety, the rage
he flew into because we had not met his expectations,

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.880
the tears that ran down our cheeks, the shouting
that followed us as we ran out into the corridor,

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.190
the feeling that we wanted to die and that
everything good was destroyed. We need the

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:09.430
novel, not the essay. Psychotherapy has long
recognised this distinction. It knows that

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.880
thinking is hugely important – but on its
own, within the therapeutic process itself,

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:22.200
it is not the key to fixing our psychological
problems. It insists on a crucial difference

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:28.520
between broadly recognising that we were shy
as a child and re-experiencing, in its full

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:34.170
intensity, what it was like to feel cowed,
ignored and in constant danger of being rebuffed

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.730
or mocked; the difference between knowing,
in an abstract way, that our mother wasn’t

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.209
much focused on us when we were little and
reconnecting with the desolate feelings we

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:50.270
had when we tried to share certain of our
needs with her. Therapy builds on the idea

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:55.910
of a return to live feelings. It’s only
when we’re properly in touch with feelings

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.860
that we can correct them with the help of
our more mature faculties – and thereby

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:08.660
address the real troubles of our adult lives.
Oddly (and interestingly) this means intellectual

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:15.470
people can have a particularly tricky time
in therapy. They get interested in the ideas.

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:21.059
But they don’t so easily recreate and exhibit
the pains and distresses of their earlier,

00:04:21.059 --> 00:04:26.800
less sophisticated selves, though it’s actually
these parts of who we all are that need to

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:34.330
be encountered, listened to and – perhaps
for the first time – comforted and reassured.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:40.479
We need, to get fully better, to go back in
time, perhaps every week or so for a few years,

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:46.680
and deeply relive what it was like to be us
at five and nine and fifteen – and allow

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:53.729
ourselves to weep and be terrified and furious
in accordance with the reality of the situation.

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:59.999
And it is on the basis of this kind of hard-won
emotional knowledge, not its more painless

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:06.219
intellectual kind, that we may one day, with
a fair wind, discover a measure of relief

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:16.150
from some of the troubles within us. Our dictionary
features the language of emotional intelligence.

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:21.740
Too often, we struggle to find the right words
to explain what we mean; this dictionary is

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:27.479
a tool to help us convey our true emotions
and intentions with economy and precision.
