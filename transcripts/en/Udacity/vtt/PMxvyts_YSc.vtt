00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.520
Abstraction implies thinking at different levels. For

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.300
example, there is the level of solving our hunger problem,

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.950
where we think about food items and where we can obtain them.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.640
An entirely separate level has to do with our physical body movements,

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.140
such as insert the key into the ignition or packing the grocery bag.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.700
For abstraction to help us solve a design problem, a key property must hold.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.610
The work done at a lower level of abstraction must contribute to the solution at

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.920
the higher level. It doesn't help us to solve our hunger problem if all we

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.730
pack into the grocery bag are paper towels and people magazine.
