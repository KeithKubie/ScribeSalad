LAURENCE MORONEY: Hi, and
welcome to this episode

00:00:02.041 --> 00:00:04.180
of Geocast, where we walk
you through what you can

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:05.590
do with the Google Maps APIs.

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.530
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.227
I'm Laurence Maroney,
and in today's episode,

00:00:15.227 --> 00:00:17.810
I'm going to talk about one of
my favorite parts of the Google

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:19.010
Maps APIs--

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.550
the ability to draw on a map
with polygons and polylines,

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.980
and the new ways that
you can style them.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.830
If you aren't already familiar
with polygons and polylines,

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.190
they're very useful tools to
help make your maps work better

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:32.360
for your users.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.250
They allow you to
draw shapes on a map

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.346
so that you can delineate areas.

00:00:36.346 --> 00:00:37.970
So, for example,
maybe you want to show

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.000
the route of your walkabout
in the Australian outback.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.980
You can do that by
drawing a polyline

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.200
between different
geographic points.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.140
Here you can see my desired
one from Melbourne to Darwin

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.070
through both Adelaide and Perth.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.360
That's a long walk and
a bit of a swim, too.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.610
Or maybe you want to
play a game on a map

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.280
with a square showing
an area of interest.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.040
You can do that by drawing
a polygon around the area,

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.920
like here, where I've defined
the boundaries for the world's

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.190
biggest game of hide and seek.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.200
In this video, I'll show
you how to style these.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.109
If you're interested in custom
styling beyond your polys,

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:14.150
we have a video for that,
too, and there's a link

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.730
to it in the description below.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.670
There are lots of options,
including stroke patterns

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.690
for outlines, such as dashed,
dotted, or mixed, all of which

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.700
can be defined the
way that you want

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.370
to give your users the
best possible experience.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.380
You can set different
ends for your line,

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.450
including having rounded
ends, [? butt ?] ends,

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.030
and square ends, or
indeed a custom end,

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.819
like the arrow shown here.

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:38.360
And there's a whole
lot more that you

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.000
can do, such as line weight
and being able to set

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.280
the color of lines and fills.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.320
In this example,
I have a polyline

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.380
which shows my desired
walkabout of Australia.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.530
I'm going to zoom into
the lovely city of Perth,

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.280
and you'll see where my line
takes a turn at a bus stop.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.340
I can now customize
the color of the line,

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.630
its alpha transparency, its
width, how the segments join

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.800
together, such as having a
bevel or rounded corners,

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.960
as well as the
pattern for the line.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.680
Here are some examples that
are built into the sample app,

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.910
but you can customize your own.

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:14.990
Polygons are similar.

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.580
Let's take a look.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.500
Here you can see my
map of the boundaries

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.140
for the world's biggest
ever game of hide and seek.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.290
It's a polygon with a couple
of holes for no go areas.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.810
Eh, lots of dingos
there, apparently.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.060
And it's a polygon
which can be filled,

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.620
and its color can be changed,
as can its opacity or alpha.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.840
The weight of the stroke
outlining the polygon

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.680
can be changed, as can
its color and opacity.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.300
If I go to one of
the corners, we

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.310
can look at the stroke joint.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.940
The joint can be the default, or
it could be beveled or rounded.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.190
You can see the default now.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.560
But I can change it to
be beveled or rounded,

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.690
which really shows up nicely
in a contrasting color.

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.257
Like with the polygon, the
stroke pattern can also be set,

00:02:59.257 --> 00:03:00.590
but you aren't limited to these.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.210
You can define your
own, and you can

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.700
see what some of the options
are, like dashed, dotted,

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.660
or mixed.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.810
And, of course, changing
the weight of the stroke

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.140
will impact how these look
at different zoom levels.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.970
But wait, there's more!

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.860
Not only can you
style your polys,

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.620
you can also attach
custom data to them.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.080
You're probably familiar with
custom data being attached

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.770
to markers, but now you can
put it on polygons, polylines,

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.230
circles, and ground overlays.

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.660
It's as easy as setting
a tag on your shape,

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.460
and then in the
OnClickListener, you

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.720
can read it back and
do something with it.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.620
Here's a simple
example of a toast.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.840
And here's what it will
look like at runtime

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.760
where, if someone
is using my app,

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.650
and they don't know
what that polygon is,

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.630
a simple click will show
them that it's my hide

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.700
and seek boundary.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.220
So that's a quick taste of
some of the great styling

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.370
features found in polygons,
polylines, and other shapes

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:53.690
in Google Maps.

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.670
We hope you enjoyed this
Geocast and can't wait

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.700
to see what you build with it.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.200
You can learn more about these
features and a whole lot more

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.880
on the Google Maps
Developer site.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.340
