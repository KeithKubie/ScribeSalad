00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.299
&gt;&gt; Sean: Why binary? Wouldn't it be much easier 
if they just used decimal numbers?
&gt;&gt; DFB:  Yes it would. This is a

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:09.469
fascinating story and it's one where
what we've mentioned already - when you

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:13.960
and I started racing around Bletchley
Park and talking about Tommy Flowers. He

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.960
is, if you like, right in the middle of
this story. 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.860
Why binary why not decimal? 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:28.510
It's caused me to think about it. Because, if
you think back to the pre-electronic

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.079
era, back to Victorian times, think of
Charles Babbage and his famous

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.570
Difference Engines. They're, of course, just
like the old-fashioned, mechanical,

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.809
hand-driven calculators - only a lot
bigger. So the question was can you, on a

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.820
mechanical gear-wheel, grind ten teeth
very accurately, and equal distances

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.640
apart, so you don't get slippage. You
don't get 0 slipping into being 1,

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.180
Yeah? So it was a mechanical challenge.
&gt;&gt; Sean: So 10 cog teeth doesn't sound like a

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.910
massive feat to deal with ?
&gt;&gt; DFB: No it isn't - but they could do even 
more. What I'm trying to 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.560
say is: even earlier than that they could
do more than that. There's been TV programs

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.049
on Greek Antikytheras that could
predict solar eclipses. Absolutely finely

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:13.530
machined teeth, so yes

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.750
ten was pretty straightforward for
Babbage and yet he still had complaints

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.509
from his gear cutters because the
large-scale automation of manufacture

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:28.439
wasn't quite there in Babbage's time and he
moaned like mad at the invoices, the

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.530
bills, he had to pay to his gear cutters.
So that was the big problem in the

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.840
mechanical era. Things however did change
enormously when we got - not just to the

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.360
electro-mechanical era, of relays, but
when you say "I'm going to be purely

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.000
electronic". Then, back in those early days -

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.710
30s, 40s - you were talking about
thermionic valves. Once again, that's vacuum

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.290
tubes for those of you in North America
- who haven't watched the earlier videos!

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.659
What you have to say to yourself there,
well, if I use those as a logic element,

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:07.350
on and off, you've got your cathode which
boils off electrons, your anode with a big

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.340
voltage on it, sucking off the electrons up here,
and in the middle

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.620
there's a grid. By putting what was called, I
think, a 'bias voltage' on the grid. If you

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.810
put a heavy negative voltage on the grid it
repelled the electrons back to the

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.080
cathode plate and didn't let them through. So you 
switched it off, So that was how it worked.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:31.540
But you needed heaters to boil the electrons
off the cathode. Heaters! Power! These things,

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.420
valves, are so power hungry it just isn't
true. So on the one hand you are getting

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:43.750
this ability to do electronic logic
elements, but the power consumption was a

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.019
problem all the time.

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.849
One reason to use binary, overwhelmingly,
is it's perfect for the logic. But I think

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:53.670
the bigger question is when you start
counting things - when you start doing the

00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:00.280
arithmetic - does it still make sense to
bust yourself to use decimal because

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.489
it's what we're used to?

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.609
Well "yes and no" I think, is the answer to that

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:09.489
The good thing about using decimal - let's say
that first of all - is that you need fewer

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:17.549
digits, yeah? But binary's a lot longer than decimal.
Obvious example, of course, is log to the

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:27.109
base 2 of 10 equals 3.322. And if anybody
wants to produce a T-shirt with that on I might even

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:34.950
buy one. What it tells you is how much more
circuitry and components do you need if

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.660
you go for a binary computer than if you
go for a decimal one.
&gt;&gt; Sean: That is just telling us

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.170
how many more digits we need?
&gt;&gt; DFB: Exactly! how many bits would you need

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:54.739
to represent 99 in binary? 
&gt;&gt; Sean: Well I know  that 8 bits is 256. 
&gt;&gt; DFB: Yes but that's too many ...
&gt;&gt; Sean: So 7 bits is 128 
&gt;&gt; DFB: Exactly!

00:03:54.739 --> 00:04:02.569
&gt;&gt; Sean: So that would encompass 99 right?
&gt;&gt; DFB: Right! So 99 requires seven bits. So how does

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:11.080
that relate to this magic 3.322? Answer:  a 
two-digit decimal number, two, if you multiply

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:20.299
it by 3.322, you end up with 6.644.
Numberphile stuff! You

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:25.600
round up. You take the 'ceiling' of that
which is the smallest integer

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.550
directly above it. You times the number of
decimal digits by 3.322 That gives you

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.550
the number of binary digits. But if in
doubt, you have to round up because you

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:40.340
must have a whole number of bits. So, straight
away you can see, therefore, that

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.820
the thing that electronics engineers
loved about binary was that it's simpler

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:51.350
to build. Now, that is so important, but
they also realized that you would need

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.510
3.3 times as much circuitry if you did binary.
So, there

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.570
was some argument that said "Well, even though
binary is right for the logic in a

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:05.410
computer, is there anything to be gained
by still sticking to decimal for the

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:10.550
arithmetic bit - for counting numbers up - not
just for doing logic operations?"
&gt;&gt; Sean: So you

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.140
could have kind of two areas to consider?
One is the actual storage of the

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:19.440
numbers and one is operation of the computer,
&gt;&gt; DFB: That's right. And I think the

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:24.560
person who really, you know, one's
respect for him goes up all the time,

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.160
Tommy Flowers of 'Colossus' fame was
absolutely on top of this. He'd done

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.500
digital logic for early digital
switching experiments in the nineteen

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.780
thirties. He knew all about this stuff. Two of
his engineers who've written up in

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:43.460
Jack Copeland's book - Gil Hayward and Harry Fensom - 
said "Tommy was always explaining to us

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:50.409
every valve you can save is that much
less power, that much less heat to worry

00:05:50.409 --> 00:06:01.409
about. If we use bi-quin ...
&gt;&gt; Sean: bi what?!
&gt;&gt; DFB: bi-qui .... bi-quin 
we can save 100-odd  valves". And bi-qui or

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:08.499
bi-quinary, base 5. Two things: five is magic for
Tunny traffic because we're coping with five-hole

00:06:08.499 --> 00:06:13.429
paper tape. That's one good thing about
it. The other good thing about it is you

00:06:13.429 --> 00:06:18.659
know from the valve circuits we design
that if you're going to count in binary 

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:23.899
you only need two voltages - you can keep 
them miles apart, that's easy. Five

00:06:23.899 --> 00:06:26.639
below ground potential five above. A ten-volt

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:31.449
span. Nothing's going to make minus five look
like plus five. But the more we try to pack

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:36.099
different levels in - and  we have to pack in
ten levels - you know what happens? These

00:06:36.099 --> 00:06:40.699
voltages drift! You start getting the voltage 
representing a six drifting a bit and it looks

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:46.479
like a seven. But he said:  "My studies show that
if we just use 5 voltages we can keep

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:51.589
them stable enough that they don't get
confused". So he came up with this idea of

00:06:51.589 --> 00:07:00.709
bi-quinary - basically two things linked in
pairs. The left-hand one did 0 to 4. The right-hand

00:07:00.709 --> 00:07:04.979
one also did 0 to 4, but knowing that it was
on the right-hand side actually

00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:10.329
represented 5 - 9.  He said we do that chaps
we save ... I think it was a hundred and

00:07:10.329 --> 00:07:15.389
something valves. And it's worth it,
because you've got to reflect that the power

00:07:15.389 --> 00:07:21.069
consumption of Colossus was 6 kilowatts. 
You didn't want to go higher than that.

00:07:21.069 --> 00:07:25.819
&gt;&gt; Sean: I can't help but draw a comparison here 
to the data-centre video. It's funny that it's kind

00:07:25.819 --> 00:07:28.050
of come full-circle in a way?

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:34.309
&gt;&gt; DFB: Absolutely!  You no sooner overcome the
problems and like Steve Furber's stuff - you

00:07:34.309 --> 00:07:38.429
know, with the ARM chip being low
power consumption? Great to do it, but then

00:07:38.429 --> 00:07:42.519
people just want more of them anyway! You
still need a data-centre; you still need

00:07:42.519 --> 00:07:47.110
massive backup power supplies of your
own and you need cheap electricity. You

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:52.429
could say that the great advantage of
that is that when you're not in a

00:07:52.429 --> 00:07:56.510
data-centre the low power demands,

00:07:56.510 --> 00:08:02.270
and so on, make these things possible.
There's no way I want that thing

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:07.820
replicated using thermionic valve technology
- not even by Tommy

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:11.670
Flowers! I do not want third-degree
burns in my shirt pocket

00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:16.889
thank you very much!
