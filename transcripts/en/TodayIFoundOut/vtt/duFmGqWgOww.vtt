00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:13.870
“No woman can run the Boston Marathon,”
said Arnie Briggs, Kathrine Switzer’s running

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.770
coach. This coming from a man who had been
excited to see a woman start running with

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.530
the all-male cross country team at Syracuse
University. He insisted that women were too

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:28.160
fragile to run for 26 miles, though he conceded
that if Switzer could do a 26-mile practice

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.949
run, he’d take her to Boston.

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:34.760
The year was 1966, and despite the Boston
Marathon having been in place for nearly seventy

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.800
years, no woman had officially run in the
race. There had been an attempt by another

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.640
woman named Roberta Gibb, who actually completed
the race in April 1966.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.530
Gibb had been denied an entry application
to run officially that year. Will Cloney,

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.050
the Boston Marathon race director that year,
wrote her and told her women were not capable

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.220
of running a marathon, and the max distance
allowed for women was only a mile and a half…

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:03.090
Gibb in the course of training for the 26
mile, 385 yard Boston Marathon had several

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.100
times run upwards of 40 miles in one day,
so naturally disagreed with Cloney on his

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.790
assessment of the fragility of women.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.990
Not allowed to officially enter, she instead
hid in the bushes at the start of the race.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.900
When the starting gun went off, she eased
into the middle of the pack of men. She wore

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.900
her brother’s Bermuda shorts and a sweatshirt
which masked her figure, with the hood up

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.299
to hide her hair. From a distance, she looked
like a man—but the men racing with her noticed

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.390
rather quickly that she was, in fact, a woman.
To her surprise, they were supportive of a

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.259
woman running alongside them, and Gibbs was
allowed to finish the race.

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.820
Eventually during the run, she removed her
sweatshirt, making it clear to the crowds

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.590
that she was a woman. Once again, Gibbs was
surprised by the response: the crowds cheered

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.520
and the local radio station announced her
progress.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.240
Gibbs ended up finishing ahead of all but
125 of the race’s 415 official entrants

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.049
that year, with a remarkable running time
of three hours, twenty-one minutes. She believed

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:00.050
that her feat would open the race up to women,
since it would prove that women were strong

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.850
enough to run the full marathon if they were
allowed to do so.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:09.090
Unfortunately for Switzer, the race hadn’t
yet opened up to women by 1967. Three weeks

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.829
before the race, Switzer and Briggs had their
“practice” marathon. At the end of the

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:18.019
26 miles, Switzer insisted they do five more.
It had the desired effect: Briggs had a change

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:22.650
of heart, and agreed that Switzer should run
in the race. However, he also insisted that

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.310
she register first or face the wrath of the
Amateur Athletic Body. They double-checked

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.019
the rulebook to find that the Boston Marathon
didn’t have any official guidelines about

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.620
gender; Roberta Gibbs had simply faced outright
discrimination the previous year when she

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.510
was denied entry because of her sex.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.819
Switzer signed her entry form “K. V. Switzer,”
which is probably how she got in—her initials

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.629
could have been a man’s, and were a lot
less revealing than “Kathrine” would have

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:48.629
been.

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:53.739
On Tuesday, April 18, 1967, Switzer hopped
in the car with Briggs as well as her boyfriend,

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.529
Tom Miller, and another man from the university
cross country team, John Leonard. They drove

00:02:58.529 --> 00:03:02.079
five hours to Boston. The marathon would take
place the next day.

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:05.949
On Wednesday, Switzer donned lipstick and,
somewhat regretfully, a big sweatshirt—it

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:10.000
was a cold, snowy day, but she had wanted
to look feminine at the start of her first

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.629
big race. After Switzer had donned her numbers
(261) and started warming up, men came up

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:19.469
to her wishing her luck. One even asked, “Can
you give me some tips to get my wife to run?

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:22.219
She’d love it if I can just get her started.”

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:26.829
Feeling support all around, Switzer had no
problem lining up at the starting line. Either

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:30.019
the officials checking off numbers didn’t
care that she was a girl, or they were too

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:34.319
hurried and distracted to take notice. When
the gun went off, Switzer ran with Briggs,

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.629
Miller, and Leonard together in a line, with
no sign of trouble in sight.

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:43.989
Around mile two, a press truck pulled up alongside
the runners, and the cameras focused on Switzer:

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.389
the first woman to run the Boston Marathon
wearing numbers. But someone else took notice,

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:53.389
too: Jock Semple, a member of the Boston Athletic
Association and the race manager, who was

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:56.579
not pleased to find a woman had somehow officially
entered the race.

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:03.790
In a rage, he came flying at Switzer and attempted
to tear her numbers off, but her boyfriend

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.000
intervened. Miller was a football player who
had no qualms about tackling Semple. When

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.669
the man landed on the ground, winded, Briggs
shouted “Run like hell!” and the group

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:13.669
sped off.

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:18.150
At first, Switzer felt humiliated by the whole
incident and considered dropping out of the

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.630
race. But she realized the implications if
she did. Like Roberta Gibbs before her, Switzer

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.780
knew that she had to keep going. As she later
said, she thought while she was running,

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.270
I have to finish this race. Even on my hands
and knees. If I don’t finish, people will

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.310
say women can’t do it, and they will say
I was just doing it for the publicity or something.

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.759
Switzer, Briggs, and Leonard crossed the finish
line with a respectable time of four hours,

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:44.800
twenty minutes. Switzer’s boyfriend, Miller
finished about an hour later. After a few

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.949
questions from the press, like “What made
you do it?” and “Are you a suffragette?”

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:52.960
the group was free to celebrate. They weren’t
arrested for assaulting a race official as

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.050
they’d feared (to be fair, he assaulted
them first!), but the official had managed

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.699
to get Switzer disqualified from the race
for being a woman, despite no clear-cut rules

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:01.020
that women were not allowed.

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.590
The effect that Switzer had on the race wasn’t
immediately apparent. She faced a lot of negative

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.060
press for her participation, but she received
positive press as well. Over the next few

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.360
years, Switzer and Gibbs were accompanied
by other women who ran in the race unofficially

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.479
in an attempt to get officials to include
women in the race. In 1972, the Boston Marathon

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:23.969
finally opened up to women who could run the
marathon in three and a half hours or less.

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:29.000
In 1984, a major barrier was broken down when
the women’s marathon was officially accepted

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.490
as an Olympic Game. Today, around 53% of runners
in competitive events in the United States

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:35.490
are women.

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:40.020
Switzer went on to win the women’s division
of the 1974 New York City Marathon finishing

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:47.020
59th overall with a time of 3:07:29. Her best
marathon time was her seventh Boston Marathon

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:55.870
in 1975, where she placed second with a remarkable
time of 2:51:37 or an average pace of 9.21

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:03.180
mph (14.82 km/h). For reference, a new course
record was set that same race by Bill Rodgers

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:23.240
and was 2:09:55 or an average pace 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:35.620
of 12.12 mph (19.5 km/h).
