00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now we get to discover the root cause of motion.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We get to answer the question how does motion occur.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Can you, using these conditions we've derived here,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
tell me which of these three equations

00:00:12.000 --> 99:59:59.000
describes motion?
