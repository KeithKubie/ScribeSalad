00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:20.270
putting into a food and if we're not
coming out of that service experience

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:20.280
coming out of that service experience
 

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:23.540
coming out of that service experience
and experience having learned something

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:23.550
and experience having learned something
 

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:25.820
and experience having learned something
about ourselves which is critical but

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:25.830
about ourselves which is critical but
 

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:28.100
about ourselves which is critical but
having learned how to live with people

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:28.110
having learned how to live with people
 

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:30.680
having learned how to live with people
who are quite different from us then I

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:30.690
who are quite different from us then I
 

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:32.840
who are quite different from us then I
think we're wasting our time even though

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:32.850
think we're wasting our time even though
 

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:36.860
think we're wasting our time even though
we're doing a little bit of good it's

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:36.870
we're doing a little bit of good it's
 

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:39.639
we're doing a little bit of good it's
that

00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:39.649
 
 

00:10:39.649 --> 00:10:43.549
 
so I can't really see
