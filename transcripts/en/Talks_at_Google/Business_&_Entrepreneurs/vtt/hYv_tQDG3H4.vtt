00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.932
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.932 --> 00:00:06.890
SPEAKER: Hi, everybody.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:08.980
Welcome to Google Talks.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.870
Today's a very special day.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.870
I want to introduce a great
friend of mine and somebody

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.420
that I really look
up to in tech space.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.170
His name is Arnell Milhouse.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.350
What makes him unique
and very special

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.050
is he has led many
hackathons in Rhode Island,

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.810
has been recognized by
President Obama, and Congress

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:26.920
men and women.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.420
Aside from that,
the beautiful thing

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.780
is that he's helped today
lead many underprivileged and

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.140
underserved markets for people
that are interested in becoming

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.430
engineers.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.040
Aside from that,
he is constantly

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.320
challenging the
status quo and always

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.050
making sure that many people
are involved and challenged

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.640
every day in a very
technological, digital age.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.890
I'd love to welcome my dearest
friend and a leader in tech

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.520
and a serial entrepreneur,
Arnell Milhouse.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.494
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:58.494 --> 00:01:00.160
ARNELL MILHOUSE: Thank
you, [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.070
Appreciate it.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.920
Thanks for having me.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.050
It's been great to be here.

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.000
All right, so good
afternoon, everyone.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.640
Again, my name is
Arnell Milhouse.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.440
And it's an interesting story
and an interesting journey

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.210
that we're embarking upon.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.270
And today we're going to
be talking about rebooting

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.640
emerging domestic markets.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.930
This concept was first spoken
about three or four decades ago

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.940
by a Harvard University
professor who

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:33.520
talked about taking urban
centers and the taking

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.760
the underserved workers
in those communities,

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.030
training them, giving them the
right technical skills or labor

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.690
skills that they needed to
integrate into society here

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:44.690
in America.

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.140
He wrote a really
great book about it,

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.080
but the concept never
really took off.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.340
And throughout my
life as I grew up,

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.170
in the story that
I'm about to share,

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.700
I always thought about how can
we really make this happen?

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.150
How can we take it from the
page and put it on the stage,

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:02.860
as they often say
on Broadway, right,

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.510
from the page to the stage.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.600
And I'm even writing
a book about it,

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.340
"Rebooting the Emerging
Domestic Markets,

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.510
Re-architecting the Middle Class
Innovation Process in America."

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:20.190
And I'm an entrepreneur,
a software developer.

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.880
But I really think of
myself as a social change

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.300
agent, someone who's trying to
bring about change and impact.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.070
Steve Jobs talked
about, of all the things

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.350
that he wanted to
do in his life,

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.890
he simply wanted to make
a dent in the universe.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.210
And it wasn't about the money.

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.170
It wasn't about the
creations or the accolades.

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.720
It was about making
a significant change.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.820
And so I created a company
called IntraCity Geeks,

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.444
along with a couple
of other gentlemen,

00:02:46.444 --> 00:02:48.570
I'll be introducing
them by name.

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.650
And another organization
called CareerDevs.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.070
IntraCity Geeks, our goal is
to simply fuel computer science

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:01.680
education into drive, innovation
driven entrepreneurship

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.320
throughout American cities
in both underserved and

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.560
underskilled markets.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.200
Our main goal is to impact
1 million plus people

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.120
in our pipeline.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.070
The organization is
called CareerDevs,

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:20.160
and CareerDevs is launching
rigorous computer science

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.860
academies along with
innovation driven

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.570
entrepreneurial incubators.

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.910
So while IntraCity Geeks
is the nonprofit arm,

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.420
CareerDevs is the
for profit arm.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.357
How all this stuff
comes together--

00:03:33.357 --> 00:03:35.440
you really need to take a
deep dive into my story.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.990
And it's a really
interesting story, I believe.

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.220
It starts off back in
Boston, Massachusetts,

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.210
where I was born.

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:47.180
I was born to a single
mother, Dorothy Lee Milhouse,

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:53.460
and single mom, which is really
the prototypical urban story

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.250
that you hear for
people of color, right?

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.520
And my mother had four
children, which one is me?

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.940
Can you guys guess?

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.240
That's me right
there, second oldest.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.140
And what was interesting
in Boston that--

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.927
we went from a middle
class neighborhood--

00:04:11.927 --> 00:04:13.260
my mother ended up getting sick.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.079
We moved from a middle class
neighborhood to a lower income

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.290
neighborhood after she took ill.

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.240
And while Roxbury, which was a
neighborhood that we moved to,

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.620
was very, very tough--

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.930
there was gunfire, drug needles,
I've had guns held to my head,

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.510
coming from school, people
robbing me for money.

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.926
I would get home, my mother
like, how was your day, honey?

00:04:35.926 --> 00:04:38.370
I'm like, oh, it was fine.

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.020
So a couple of things
were interesting.

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.609
One, we didn't know
that we were poor.

00:04:42.609 --> 00:04:43.650
And we didn't know that--

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.837
I didn't know that
we should be unhappy.

00:04:45.837 --> 00:04:46.420
We were happy.

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.050
We had a nice family.

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.270
But one day, my mother-- when
we were on welfare, food stamps,

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.990
Section 8 housing--

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.530
she took her housing certificate
to the housing authorities

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.100
and said she wanted to move.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.610
And they were asking her,
where do you want to move?

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.190
And she mentioned that she
wanted to move to Cape Cod,

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:07.190
right?

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.780
And it wasn't until we
actually moved to Cape Cod,

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.820
that I noticed this.

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.750
That the urban lifestyle
formula that we

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.210
had been living, that there was
a vicious perpetuating cycle

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.240
that repeated itself.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.840
So in eighth grade,
we packed up.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.640
We moved to Cape Cod.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.820
And it was, you
know, this is a place

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.010
that people travel to
for vacations from all

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:39.910
around the world, and I'm
living there 365 days a year.

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:45.520
But I noticed another cycle a
virtuous perpetuating cycle,

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.850
which was the opposite of what
was taking place in Boston.

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:57.560
And for the first time in
my life, something changed--

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.720
my world view.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.960
Because living in
Boston and Cape Cod,

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.610
the dichotomy was
incredibly different.

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:10.170
On the Cape, I
was taking courses

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:14.250
such as Latin, where I learned
one of my favorite jokes--

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:17.460
[SPEAKING LATIN]

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.110
Where are your underwear?

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:21.900
We even had a rap for Latin.

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.400
Latin is a dead language.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.720
It's dead as it can be.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.380
First it killed the Romans,
and now it's killing me.

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.770
[SPEAKING LATIN]

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.530
And so I'm learning all
these different things.

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:38.000
And when we moved
to the Cape, we

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.250
didn't live in
tenement buildings

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.260
that you found in the city.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.810
We lived right off the 7th
hole of the Dennis Pines Golf

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.520
Course.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.010
And I remember waking
up one morning,

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:51.140
I saw all these little
white balls in my yard.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:52.640
And I said, Mom,
why are these balls

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:53.840
keep coming into our yard?

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.590
And what are those
people out there doing?

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:57.779
What are they--
are they farming?

00:06:57.779 --> 00:06:59.320
It looks like they're
trying to farm.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.799
What are they planting?

00:07:01.799 --> 00:07:02.840
I couldn't understand it.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.548
She was, no, honey,
they're playing golf.

00:07:04.548 --> 00:07:06.740
I said, what is golf?

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:12.800
And I learned about
Camelot, the Kennedys.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:17.030
They lived 10 minutes from me,
the Kennedy compound, John F.

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:21.255
Kennedy, his family,
everyone, their lineage.

00:07:21.255 --> 00:07:22.130
So I heard the story.

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:24.740
I was regaled with
all of the tales

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.470
of their fame and their
wealth, and it was just

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:29.150
a different
perspective of learning

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:31.960
about a former president,
that their family lived down

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:32.460
the street.

00:07:36.846 --> 00:07:38.470
The next stage was
kind of interesting.

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:40.511
My first job in high school
took place at a place

00:07:40.511 --> 00:07:44.530
called Fred's Turkey House.

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:47.410
Now this is really impactful.

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:49.320
Because I started
off as a dishwasher,

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.820
then a prep cook, then a
line cook, then a chef.

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:54.925
But at this restaurant,
the person that owned it,

00:07:54.925 --> 00:07:57.220
his name was Fred Blum,
one of my greatest mentors

00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:58.810
and influences in my life.

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:01.080
He had about four or five
restaurants on the Cape.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.663
And there was a gentleman that
went to Harvard University that

00:08:03.663 --> 00:08:06.580
graduated in computer science
who worked for him, running

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:07.790
all of the communications.

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:10.870
Jeff Rule, he was
talking about trying

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:14.879
to lure me to the dark side,
which is computer science.

00:08:14.879 --> 00:08:17.170
Because Arnell, because you
don't want to be a laborer,

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:18.640
sweating away in a
kitchen all your life.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:20.260
He goes, listen,
you know, you love

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:21.926
playing around with
computers and making

00:08:21.926 --> 00:08:23.290
these video games in school.

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:23.990
Stick with that.

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:24.900
And so I said, uh.

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:27.400
But then Fred said, hey, no,
listen, go to Johnson and Wales

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:30.460
University, come back here
and manage my restaurants.

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:33.100
So there was a light side
and a dark side tempting me.

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:38.780
Then in high school, I took
my first computer programming

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:42.620
class, Pascal, fell in love.

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:44.110
Myself and several
other students,

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:46.790
we were always getting in
trouble, doing things with code

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:48.420
that you shouldn't be doing.

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:50.450
And then I got a job
working for my high school,

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:53.630
making $12 an hour as a junior.

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:54.300
I was hooked.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.508
I was making more than I
was making in the restaurant

00:08:56.508 --> 00:08:59.266
business, and it
was just phenomenal.

00:08:59.266 --> 00:09:01.640
Something else interesting
that that happened on the Cape

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:05.420
was, one of my teachers was
asking where I lived in Boston.

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:07.220
I said, oh, I remember
living, we once

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:09.170
lived on Mass Ave,
Massachusetts Avenue.

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:12.770
And she said, oh, you were
right down the street from MIT.

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:15.200
I said M I what?

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.150
M I who?

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:19.820
She goes no, MIT, Ivy
League university?

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:20.926
Never heard of it.

00:09:20.926 --> 00:09:24.180
She goes, it was less than
a quarter mile from you.

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:28.620
And that really bothered me.

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:31.950
That MIT and Harvard
were so close,

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:36.166
but they might as well have
been miles away, planets away,

00:09:36.166 --> 00:09:37.290
different universe, really.

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:42.520
Going to school on
the Cape, students

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:47.150
would pull up in the school in
BMWs, Mercedes, or just brand

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:50.190
new cars, brand new Toyotas.

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:52.860
When our car, even though
we lived on the Cape,

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:54.152
it was still--

00:09:54.152 --> 00:09:55.770
we were still poor.

00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:57.510
We were using a
housing certificate

00:09:57.510 --> 00:09:59.070
to live on Cape Cod.

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:02.050
So sometimes dropping
us off at school--

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:05.652
we had this station wagon
that had mismatched wheels,

00:10:05.652 --> 00:10:07.110
smoke coming out
of the back of it.

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:08.790
And so I would beg
my mom, can you

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:11.085
please, can you drop
me off down the street?

00:10:11.085 --> 00:10:13.460
She goes, honey, but it's
still like a quarter mile walk.

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:16.360
I was just embarrassed to pull
up in the school in that car.

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:27.280
What was happening was that I
was experiencing culture shock.

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:29.740
I was seriously
undergoing a sense

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:35.930
of disorientation and disbelief
about what I was seeing.

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:41.030
My middle school, the
cafeteria was more reminiscent

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:43.950
of what you have here.

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:46.740
In Boston, we didn't
have a cafeteria.

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:50.580
Everything was makeshift, and
the food wasn't that great.

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.670
Periodically, we would travel
back and forth to Boston.

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:58.630
And I began to see this
divergence between my cousins'

00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:05.480
lives and my friends' lives,
my friends and their parents

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:08.930
on the Cape versus my friends
and their parents in Boston.

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:10.910
As I was in Boston,
I would notice

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:13.040
the adults were talking
about how hard things

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.899
were, that there were
no opportunities.

00:11:15.899 --> 00:11:16.940
They just lost their job.

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:19.580
They couldn't get ahead.

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:22.430
Their electricity was
being turned off this week.

00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:24.440
On the Cape,
everything was happy,

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:26.030
and everyone was doing fine.

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:27.410
And as we would
go back and forth

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:29.930
it was lights on, lights off.

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:35.600
Lights on, lights off,
it was disconcerting.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:36.770
And I didn't know--

00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:42.840
I said-- and Boston and
Cape Cod, 60 miles apart.

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:46.210
So it really, really, really
troubled me, back and forth,

00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:52.185
Cape Cod, Boston,
Cape Cod to Boston.

00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:01.380
And I remember the exact moment
that this thing happened.

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:04.521
I woke up one morning, and I
realized I had two world views.

00:12:04.521 --> 00:12:06.270
Because of my friends
in Boston, they all,

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:09.600
and myself included, when I
initially moved to Cape Cod,

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:14.370
I wanted to be a rapper,
basketball player, or some type

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:17.007
of athlete or entertainer.

00:12:17.007 --> 00:12:18.590
Where everyone in
the Cape was talking

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:20.006
about where we're
going to school,

00:12:20.006 --> 00:12:21.960
what we're going to
do with our careers.

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:26.900
And so hearing two
different worlds,

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:28.910
two different world
views, and I saw

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:31.400
that one world view
was just crumbling

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:33.824
and the other was thriving.

00:12:33.824 --> 00:12:36.115
So I left high school, and
I went to college at Johnson

00:12:36.115 --> 00:12:38.920
and Wales University,
computer science, much

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:41.340
like my buddy Cliff.

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:44.100
And at Johnson and Wales,
things really took off.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:46.050
I was a computer lab assistant.

00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:48.881
And that's when I
learned about innovation.

00:12:48.881 --> 00:12:50.880
I started taking some of
the processes that they

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:53.610
had in place that
took four or five

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:55.187
days to change
the computers over

00:12:55.187 --> 00:12:57.270
at the end of each semester,
and I brought it down

00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:59.250
to a three hour process.

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:00.600
And my bosses were freaking out.

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:02.070
They were like, oh, my
goodness, this is amazing.

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:03.570
And there were a
lot of other things

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:07.807
that I did that really, really
impacted the University.

00:13:07.807 --> 00:13:09.640
Something really, really
bad happened though

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:11.320
my freshman year.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.750
My mother passed away.

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:16.877
All those years of being sick,
[INAUDIBLE] she passed away.

00:13:16.877 --> 00:13:19.210
My younger brother and younger
sister, my older brother,

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:21.430
myself-- we had to try to figure
out what are we going to do.

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:23.410
My older brother said,
you stay in school,

00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:26.780
work hard, send money
home on the weekends.

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:29.530
And I did that.

00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:32.120
In my sophomore year, I
became a senior lab assistant

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:35.234
at Johnson Wales, which meant
I received free tuition, which

00:13:35.234 --> 00:13:35.900
really saved me.

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:38.120
Because the school
was sending me notices

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:43.090
that you have no money,
you can't stay in school.

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:45.430
And I graduated Johnson Wales
and something interesting

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:46.210
happened.

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:51.049
The second job that
I had was in Boston.

00:13:51.049 --> 00:13:52.590
And when I was on
the Cape, my mother

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:56.330
would tell me all the time,
pay attention, Arnell.

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:59.030
I brought you down here so
that you could pay attention

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:04.790
to find out how people
are becoming successful.

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:07.080
In family after family,
what does your father do?

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:08.790
Oh, he's into technology.

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:11.100
Again, there was Jeff
at Fred's Turkey House.

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:13.932
Arnell, come to the dark side.

00:14:13.932 --> 00:14:15.890
But every family seemed
to have some connection

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:20.419
to some type of technical
organization working in Boston.

00:14:20.419 --> 00:14:22.460
So I said, I'm going to
apply to a job in Boston.

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:26.300
I applied for this data
telecommunications company,

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:27.390
walked into the company.

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:30.800
Another shock-- I
walked in, and I

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:34.042
was the only person of color
within the entire organization.

00:14:34.042 --> 00:14:35.750
And I said, they're
not going to hire me.

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:37.280
I'm like, there's no way.

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:41.250
But I become really
good at what I do,

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:43.710
with technology,
computer science.

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:45.350
So I got an offer
letter in the mail.

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:48.350
And it was for $80,000.

00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:55.810
And it was the second time that
I was shocked, culture shock.

00:14:55.810 --> 00:14:59.830
The company, much
like here at Google--

00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:06.280
cafeteria, food, chefs coming
in, massage therapists.

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:08.530
I didn't know that it
was leading up to this.

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:18.070
$80,000 a year, $15,000 annual
bonus, 15,000 shares of stock,

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:19.540
what is stock?

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:22.270
Stock, what is stock?

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:24.520
Is that like Campbell's stock?

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:25.120
I didn't know.

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:28.630
Are they going to send me
15,000 cans of Campbell's stock?

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:31.720
I don't want that.

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:35.890
But it was culture
shock, round two.

00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:37.810
Something else hit me.

00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:40.090
I was no longer poor.

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:43.250
And it was welcome
to the middle class.

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:47.270
But I think, as hard as
it was making it there,

00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:50.960
if I had known that it was
going to be that difficult,

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:53.320
I probably would have given up.

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.280
But since I had
made it this far,

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:57.820
I said, why stop at
the middle class?

00:15:57.820 --> 00:15:59.350
Why not keep on going?

00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:02.350
What's the next
exit have in store?

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:06.080
So something interesting
started happening.

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:10.120
My friends, family, and
neighbors started noticing.

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:13.010
Oh, Arnell has some
new clothes, new car,

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:14.990
living in a nice house.

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:19.460
So people were peaking,
and then people

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:22.800
started knocking at my
door, especially my friends.

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:24.941
I have a friend that
was in the Marines.

00:16:24.941 --> 00:16:26.690
And he came up to me,
says Arnell, listen,

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:27.790
I just got in the Marines.

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:29.331
It's all I need to
do is shoot a gun.

00:16:29.331 --> 00:16:30.680
What do I do?

00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:33.660
I got him involved
in technology.

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:35.560
And then after him--

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:38.530
his name is Jason,
he's African-American;

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:42.390
another friend of mine,
Rick, Jamaican background;

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:50.210
Hov, Cambodian; Tim,
Irish-American; Dave, English;

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:51.770
OC, Latino.

00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:55.190
Tim, Kevin, Derek, Sam, Charlie,
Lynn, John, Mike, Will, Jeff,

00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:57.410
Chuck, Devin, Pete, Rob, Kurt--

00:16:57.410 --> 00:16:59.840
so many other
people that started

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:03.230
coming to me and my friends
to get involved in technology.

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:07.010
People who were on welfare,
unemployed, or severely

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:13.950
underemployed, overall
about 25 people

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:16.829
who now have an
aggregate annual income

00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:19.060
of over two million dollars.

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:21.250
And if you look at the
majority of those people,

00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:24.349
all got married, all own homes.

00:17:24.349 --> 00:17:27.680
And so that cycle that my
mother was caught up in,

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:30.670
so many other people were
caught in, single mother,

00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:32.530
no father in the household--

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:35.360
was now being broken in
so many people's lives.

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:38.530
And so many children,
including myself,

00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:45.260
my two amazing sons right here
and my amazing wife, who I

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.390
would not be here without.

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:53.590
And so I started
thinking, again,

00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:57.730
how do we solve the
income inequality puzzle?

00:17:57.730 --> 00:17:59.930
And the solution is simple.

00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:02.080
We have to do it at
scale, and that's

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:05.290
where I really began
thinking about the rebooting

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:06.420
emerging domestic markets.

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:13.320
So I had my great moment
of epiphany, seen it,

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:15.180
what all of my
friends had attained.

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:16.710
And then over the
past few years,

00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:20.280
looking at all of the
pain that this country has

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:26.760
been going through with the
battles between race and income

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:29.696
and the haves and the
have nots, I said,

00:18:29.696 --> 00:18:31.320
what I've done for
my friends, I simply

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:32.944
need to do for the
rest of the country.

00:18:32.944 --> 00:18:35.340
That's easy, right, no problem.

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:41.020
So I started a company
called IntraCity Geeks.

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:43.060
It's a nonprofit.

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:44.540
And something
interesting happened.

00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:48.130
I put an ad up on Brown
University's website,

00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:53.430
and this double major,
[INAUDIBLE] econ brainiac

00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:55.840
named Rapolas Binkys applied.

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:59.080
I sit down with him, blew me
away with his intelligence.

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:01.540
He worked with me, getting
the organization going.

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:03.070
And then I met
another gentleman.

00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:05.530
And he's here today
in the audience.

00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:10.510
His name is Cliff, brainiac.

00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:13.610
We've seen like the
Superman comics, Brainiac?

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:14.750
That's Cliff right there.

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:16.754
And we'll talk a
little more about that.

00:19:16.754 --> 00:19:18.170
But at IntraCity
Geeks, we started

00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:22.979
teaching at the middle
school level in Providence.

00:19:22.979 --> 00:19:24.770
And it got picked up
in the news, like wow,

00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:26.090
this is really cool.

00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:29.710
No one has done this before,
or at least not at the scale

00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:33.130
that we were looking
to run our programs.

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:35.170
We were on Channel 10.

00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:39.354
We were taking students to
hackathons at Brown University.

00:19:39.354 --> 00:19:40.270
And they were growing.

00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:42.730
They were doing amazing
things with themselves.

00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:46.240
In the red shirt here, you
can see my son Matthias.

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:48.580
He actually teaches with me now.

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:52.300
He's a lead instructor for
elementary school students.

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:55.060
He's 14 years old,
eighth grader-- actually,

00:19:55.060 --> 00:20:01.600
not 14 yet, in a few
weeks, he's going to be.

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:02.850
But he's doing amazing things.

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:07.040
And again, that
generational stronghold,

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:09.330
that generational
change affect, having

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:12.810
a father figure, a mother
figure that's nurturing him,

00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:14.070
to help him grow.

00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:19.300
And Elias is coming up
behind, learning as well.

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:22.230
So we went from middle
schools to high schools,

00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:26.040
teaching, talking about how
they can get jobs in technology.

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:31.350
$72,000 is the average of the
jobs paying in Rhode Island.

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:34.330
The mayor of Providence
contacted us and said, hey,

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:36.000
you're doing some great things.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.260
What can we do together?

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:41.030
So we created a hackathon
for the city of Providence.

00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:44.170
And not just any
hackathon, but we were also

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:47.700
recognized by President
Obama for our work.

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:53.351
It was on the White House
website, August 4th, 2015.

00:20:53.351 --> 00:20:55.100
The culture shock is
continuing to happen.

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:59.170
I'm seeing the vision fulfilled
of what we're trying to do.

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:02.660
And for one of the
hackathons that we did--

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:06.480
what we attempted to
do, we built a satellite

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:08.010
communications
array to communicate

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:10.860
with the astronauts in the
International Space Station

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:14.341
as it flew overhead,
over Providence.

00:21:14.341 --> 00:21:15.840
The astronauts were
sleeping, but we

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:20.720
did get a ping connection
signal with our device.

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:23.590
But we've stressed to the
students-- when we did this,

00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:25.590
we partnered with a group
from Brown University,

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:27.900
middle school students
and high school students,

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:32.950
who assembled the communications
array, designed it,

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:34.120
and got it working--

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:36.100
this is the type of
innovation that we

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:38.110
want to let students
know is possible.

00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:39.950
And they're like, now
they go out there,

00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:41.437
they have the apps
on their phone.

00:21:41.437 --> 00:21:43.270
I get calls from students
all the time, hey,

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:45.700
I'm looking at the International
Space Station going up

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:46.450
overhead.

00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:49.137
I'm following them
on Twitter, right?

00:21:49.137 --> 00:21:50.720
And they're talking
about engineering.

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:53.026
They're talking
about aeronautics.

00:21:53.026 --> 00:21:54.400
These are the
impacts and changes

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:58.060
that you want to make everyone
can't move to Cape Cod.

00:21:58.060 --> 00:21:59.920
After that, the
governor of Rhode Island

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:03.130
got in contact with us through
her innovation department,

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:06.520
and we created a
hackathon for the state.

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:09.460
I also taught a Harvard computer
science class called cs50

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:11.470
in Rhode Island.

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:12.910
Over 500 people applied.

00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:14.800
We enrolled 150.

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:19.000
And cs50 is rooted in the C
programming language-- data

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.440
structures, algorithms,
computational thinking,

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:25.360
strong, strong rigor.

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:30.440
And it was during that course,
and here's a snapshot of it,

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:33.130
that's my head there.

00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:36.000
I'll give you that same view.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.100
But during that class,
I met one student that

00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:40.900
approached me halfway through.

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:42.525
Everyone was two or
three weeks behind.

00:22:42.525 --> 00:22:44.733
Except for one student, who
comes up to me, and says,

00:22:44.733 --> 00:22:46.120
I'm finished with the course.

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:47.830
I said you can't be.

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:49.750
That was Cliff.

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:52.570
Toward the end of the class,
Harvard had a global computer

00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:57.490
comp coding competition, and
Cliff's team was only one

00:22:57.490 --> 00:22:59.800
of 13 that finished
with a perfect score out

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:06.400
of 630 something teams
worldwide, perfect score.

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:07.750
I was impressed.

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:09.310
We began to hang
out a little bit,

00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:14.870
and Cliff became my third geek
crush that I had in my life.

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:17.650
The first was Jeff Rule
from Fred's Turkey House,

00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:22.270
the second was Rapolas,
and then Cliff.

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:24.920
So from there, we
formed CareerDevs.

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:27.100
And CareerDevs is
the for profit arm.

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:29.740
We're launching a computer
science training academy

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:30.510
this summer.

00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:34.120
We're teaching people in Rhode
Island, New York and Boston

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:37.400
rigorous computer science.

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:40.360
We were just in
Brooklyn two weeks ago.

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:42.610
We're coming back again in May.

00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:46.180
And there are 36 schools
in the five boroughs

00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:49.510
that are interested in having
CareerDevs do work there--

00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:51.430
same in Boston, same
in Rhode Island.

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:53.401
So we're expanding rapidly.

00:23:53.401 --> 00:23:55.900
In addition, the way that we're
going to do computer science

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:56.950
is different than at boot camps.

00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:58.616
We don't call it a
computer science boot

00:23:58.616 --> 00:24:04.862
camp, because the students
are really going to--

00:24:04.862 --> 00:24:06.820
too oftentimes, when we
see students graduating

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:11.830
from boot camps, they can't
do anything significant

00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:13.850
when they complete the course.

00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:16.450
So we want to make sure that
there's a lot of testing

00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:20.730
and a lot of rigor and ideation.

00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:22.230
At every stage, we
want to make sure

00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:24.370
that there's a creation
portion that they

00:24:24.370 --> 00:24:29.740
can reiterate, and from recall,
do examples that they create.

00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:32.800
It's really, really
important, plus the focus

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:34.600
on data structures
and algorithms,

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:37.570
which Cliff is a Jedi knight.

00:24:37.570 --> 00:24:40.230
Or would that be a Sith,
since we are on the dark side?

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:41.014
Probably a Sith.

00:24:41.014 --> 00:24:42.430
The other thing
that's interesting

00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:45.940
is that I've had several
entrepreneurial journeys

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:47.470
over the years.

00:24:47.470 --> 00:24:49.840
And a couple of years ago,
I created a organization

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:52.230
called CrowdSigned.

00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:56.220
And I applied to one
of the big incubators.

00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:58.380
And I thought, wow, they're
going to love my idea.

00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:00.140
And they rejected me.

00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:01.890
I didn't have an
understanding of metrics,

00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:04.620
total addressable market space.

00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:07.320
There were a lot of things
I didn't understand.

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:08.992
So I had to hit the books.

00:25:08.992 --> 00:25:10.700
One of my friends
said, oh, go up to MIT.

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:14.060
They're having this of
course on entrepreneurship.

00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:17.650
So I went up there, registered,
sat in on it, learned a ton.

00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:20.140
Like, oh, Bill Aulet,
he has this great book.

00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:24.030
You should check it out,
"Disciplined Entrepreneurship."

00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:26.360
So I internalized that.

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:29.480
And as I've done that,
several other people

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:34.880
have come to me now saying they
want some entrepreneurial help

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:36.215
with their products.

00:25:36.215 --> 00:25:40.220
In the same way that I helped my
friends learning about computer

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:44.854
science, I'm now helping people
learn about entrepreneurship.

00:25:44.854 --> 00:25:47.020
So Cliff and myself, we're
going to be also teaching

00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:49.330
about entrepreneurship.

00:25:49.330 --> 00:25:54.480
And as CareerDevs launches,
two of the companies

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:56.960
that we're highlighting--
one is called Common Connect.

00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:03.360
It allows you to
connect with people

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:07.110
as you would with
LinkedIn professionally,

00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:09.810
but socially, based
upon your location.

00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:11.430
How many times
are you traveling,

00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:16.230
you're walking past someone
on Eighth or Ninth or 16th,

00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:19.049
that you could probably
have a lot of synergy with,

00:26:19.049 --> 00:26:20.340
but you don't know that person.

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:21.965
Now with Common
Connect in your pocket,

00:26:21.965 --> 00:26:24.007
when you're passing that
person, you'll know.

00:26:24.007 --> 00:26:25.590
And since you're in
the same vicinity,

00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:27.640
you'll be able to connect.

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:31.180
Another one is
called CrowdSigned,

00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:36.990
informed analytics that
help drive the market

00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:40.270
for unsigned artists.

00:26:40.270 --> 00:26:46.740
So it's data driven, analytic
driven, innovative IP

00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:49.110
behind both of these companies
that we're launching.

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:52.200
And Cliff's the lead
developer on both of those.

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:54.630
So what's our vision?

00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:56.739
It's the same thing that
happened with my friends.

00:26:56.739 --> 00:26:58.280
But instead of people
now, we're also

00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:01.970
looking at
corporations, companies.

00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:04.250
The difference being not
just starting a business,

00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:07.880
but what's a scalable,
innovation driven,

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:14.130
IP portfolio driven
incubator look

00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:16.050
like that's designed
for the underskilled

00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:17.130
and the underserved?

00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:22.970
Because I've been convinced
by Bill Aulet and people

00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:27.250
from Brown University
like Dan Warshay--

00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:29.620
anyone can learn
entrepreneurship.

00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:31.970
And anyone can learn
computer science

00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:34.490
if they apply
themselves long enough,

00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:36.410
if they hack at it long enough.

00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:39.530
And so our goal is to create
this multiplier, this network

00:27:39.530 --> 00:27:43.280
multiplier that will
really bring upon this era

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:46.280
where we can reboot emerging
domestic markets here

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:47.520
in this country.

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:51.994
And so over time, stay
tuned, and thank you.

00:27:51.994 --> 00:28:02.110
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:04.110
If you are interested in
getting contact with us

00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:06.030
or following our story,
you can follow along

00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:09.840
on IntraCityGeeks.org,
CareerDevs.com,

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:13.410
and you can email
Cliff, myself as noted.

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:14.424
Thanks once again.

00:28:14.424 --> 00:28:18.060
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:20.680
So we're going to take
a couple of questions.

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:24.450
If anyone has any questions,
they can feel free to ask them.

00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:26.640
Or if you're interested
in working for us

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:27.610
and leaving Google.

00:28:27.610 --> 00:28:29.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:29.410 --> 00:28:31.280
Yes, and we have
microphones over there.

00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:33.738
So we're going to have each
person stand up at a microphone

00:28:33.738 --> 00:28:35.360
to ask their questions.

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:37.580
AUDIENCE: Throughout all of
the struggles that you've

00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:41.990
faced with two different
cities, moving back and forth,

00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:46.010
what kept you so motivated to
continue to go from the lower

00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:48.860
class to middle class
to now being, obviously,

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:50.750
a very wealthy individual?

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:51.480
ARNELL MILHOUSE: I
don't know if I would

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:52.646
say very wealthy individual.

00:28:52.646 --> 00:28:58.490
But-- I took an Uber
here this morning.

00:28:58.490 --> 00:29:00.025
Don't have a chauffeur.

00:29:00.025 --> 00:29:03.625
But my motivation was--

00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:09.437
you know it's interesting.

00:29:09.437 --> 00:29:11.520
So here's an interesting
story that from Cape Cod.

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:14.270
I remember once being out in the
ocean with some of my friends.

00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:15.610
You know, one of my
friends said hey,

00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:17.068
let's swim out to
my father's boat.

00:29:17.068 --> 00:29:18.319
It was that type of situation.

00:29:18.319 --> 00:29:20.943
So we're swimming out to what we
thought was his father's boat.

00:29:20.943 --> 00:29:22.320
And he told us, he was joking.

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:23.820
He goes this isn't
my father's boat.

00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:24.819
It's that one out there.

00:29:24.819 --> 00:29:26.170
It's much further away.

00:29:26.170 --> 00:29:31.440
And so in that situation
there, you just

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:34.700
keep swimming because
you have to swim.

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:41.600
And as I made it one
mile or past one goal,

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:43.710
I just kept going,
and I kept swimming.

00:29:43.710 --> 00:29:47.060
And then once, like
I said, because when

00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:48.750
I made it to the middle class.

00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:50.330
I said, OK, well,
I did this now.

00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:54.290
And even though it's hard
work, I'm going to keep going.

00:29:54.290 --> 00:29:57.680
Because I look back at a
lot of my friends and family

00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:59.350
that were in Boston.

00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:02.130
Everyone's working
hard, whether you're

00:30:02.130 --> 00:30:04.240
a lower class, middle
class, or upper class,

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:06.750
everyone has a pretty
hard life in terms

00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:08.250
of the hours that
you have to put in

00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:09.700
and things of that nature.

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:12.669
So I'd rather work hard
to bring about success

00:30:12.669 --> 00:30:14.460
and also try to bring
people along with me.

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:15.780
So it's just--

00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:18.000
I've never really
thought about why.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.160
So to answer your
question, I don't know.

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:23.520
But it's just something
you don't give up.

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:24.570
You just can't give up.

00:30:24.570 --> 00:30:27.110
And I know that I had my
younger brother and sister.

00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:30.070
That was a great motivating
factor for me as well.

00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:33.240
And then once they were set,
I had friends and family

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:34.860
that came along.

00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:36.930
And you know, you
always see needs.

00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:41.820
And I guess you see needs and
needs that need to be met,

00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:43.430
and you go for it.

00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:45.330
Thank you.

00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:46.210
Any other questions?

00:30:49.804 --> 00:30:51.470
AUDIENCE: Thanks for
sharing your story.

00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:53.220
I really appreciate
it, very inspiring.

00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:53.520
ARNELL MILHOUSE: Thank you.

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:56.019
AUDIENCE: You talked about how
the goal with IntraCity Geeks

00:30:56.019 --> 00:30:59.120
is to help inner city
middle youth make

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:02.960
the jump to middle class
through technology jobs.

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:05.700
Have you considered looking into
other professions, like law,

00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:07.864
medicine, finance,
and other professions

00:31:07.864 --> 00:31:09.530
for people who might
not find themselves

00:31:09.530 --> 00:31:11.570
very attuned to technology?

00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:14.030
ARNELL MILHOUSE: Yes, and I
believe that will be the goal.

00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:17.150
But like with most things,
when you're starting something,

00:31:17.150 --> 00:31:19.700
you can only do one thing well.

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:21.440
You can only do one thing well.

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:24.925
And for instance, Google started
off doing just a search engine.

00:31:24.925 --> 00:31:27.050
And now you guys are doing
a couple of other things

00:31:27.050 --> 00:31:30.860
in addition to search, right?

00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:32.959
And so yes, but we
do want to expand

00:31:32.959 --> 00:31:34.250
to bring more people into that.

00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:37.340
Because not everyone is going
to be a programmer or a network

00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:37.974
engineer.

00:31:37.974 --> 00:31:38.640
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:39.800
ARNELL MILHOUSE:
Yeah, thank you.

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:40.300
Thank you.

00:31:42.290 --> 00:31:44.040
AUDIENCE: So thank you
for taking the time

00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:45.120
and sharing your story.

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:46.950
So what is success
for IntraCity Geeks?

00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:51.210
And what do you guys want
to accomplish over time?

00:31:51.210 --> 00:31:54.900
ARNELL MILHOUSE: So success for
IntraCity Geeks and CareerDevs

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:58.540
is pretty large.

00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:03.750
I always ask the question and
it seems crazy when I hear it.

00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:06.240
When I hear the goal in
my head, it sounds crazy.

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:12.080
But when you think of John F.
Kennedy standing up and saying

00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:13.719
in that New England accent--

00:32:13.719 --> 00:32:15.510
we're going to-- by
the end of this decade,

00:32:15.510 --> 00:32:19.290
we're going to put one
man on the moon, right?

00:32:19.290 --> 00:32:23.490
Or you look at the
accomplishments of individuals

00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:30.620
and companies, such as
Google, self-driving cars,

00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:34.520
the work that's being done
with TensorFlow and machine

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:37.610
learning, and just all the
advances that that's bringing

00:32:37.610 --> 00:32:40.830
about, my goal is to--

00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:44.100
and it's been talked
about so much--

00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:47.720
but I really believe
that in America we

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:55.570
can set the example for having
balanced income equality.

00:32:55.570 --> 00:32:59.530
Not everyone is going to
be a Jeff Bezos or Larry

00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:02.200
Page or a Bill Gates.

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:08.510
But you don't have to have
large swaths of our society

00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:11.330
that are living in squalor.

00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:12.760
I believe that we can--

00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:15.950
and the impact that
people have that

00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:17.930
are underserved
and underskilled--

00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:23.510
they can contribute to the might
of the American economic engine

00:33:23.510 --> 00:33:27.890
to make us an even stronger
and greater country.

00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:30.600
And that's not just
for urban markets.

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:33.440
But that's also for
suburban markets.

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:34.920
The principal from
my high school

00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:37.045
says, Arnell, we need you
to come here to the Cape.

00:33:37.045 --> 00:33:43.940
Because we have those pockets
of underskilled people here.

00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:45.640
And so it's not
just an urban thing.

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:49.009
It's not just a black thing or
a Latino thing or a white thing.

00:33:49.009 --> 00:33:51.050
There are poor people
everywhere in this country.

00:33:51.050 --> 00:33:51.841
And that's my goal.

00:33:51.841 --> 00:33:57.210
My goal is to create
balanced income equality.

00:33:57.210 --> 00:33:58.290
Well, thanks once again.

00:33:58.290 --> 00:34:00.450
I really appreciate the
opportunity of being here.

00:34:00.450 --> 00:34:02.520
And we'll see you next time.

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:08.270
[APPLAUSE]
