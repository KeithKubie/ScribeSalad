00:00:00.288 --> 00:00:01.466
- [Instructor] In this
video we're gonna talk about

00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:04.085
different ways of structuring an economy.

00:00:04.085 --> 00:00:05.979
In particular, who owns what

00:00:05.979 --> 00:00:08.377
and how does an economy
decide what to produce

00:00:08.377 --> 00:00:12.195
and who gets the output
of that production.

00:00:12.195 --> 00:00:16.362
So on one side, you have what's
known as a command economy

00:00:18.116 --> 00:00:20.860
and good examples of command economies

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.762
are the communist states,

00:00:22.762 --> 00:00:24.845
especially during the 20th century,

00:00:24.845 --> 00:00:28.809
The USSR, the Soviet Union
being the best example of that.

00:00:28.809 --> 00:00:32.013
In a command economy,
the government controls

00:00:32.013 --> 00:00:34.890
what's often known as
the factors of production

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.815
and sometimes, in an extreme case,

00:00:36.815 --> 00:00:39.390
there might not even be private ownership.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.741
So lets say that this right
over here is the government.

00:00:42.741 --> 00:00:43.949
I'll do this with some type

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:46.509
of a building with pillars in it.

00:00:46.509 --> 00:00:48.787
So this is the government.

00:00:48.787 --> 00:00:50.286
And in a command economy,

00:00:50.286 --> 00:00:53.945
the government will often own
the factories and the farms,

00:00:53.945 --> 00:00:55.796
so the factors of production.

00:00:55.796 --> 00:00:58.964
So let me draw a little factory here.

00:00:58.964 --> 00:01:00.967
So with a little smoke stack...

00:01:00.967 --> 00:01:02.820
And so the government
will tell this factory,

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.658
"This year, you have to
produce exactly 10,000 cars,"

00:01:07.658 --> 00:01:09.657
"No more and no less."

00:01:09.657 --> 00:01:10.793
and so that factory say,

00:01:10.793 --> 00:01:13.206
"Okay, you're our boss,
you're the government."

00:01:13.206 --> 00:01:16.350
"We will produce exactly 10,000 cars."

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.326
Similarly, the government might tell some,

00:01:19.326 --> 00:01:22.057
let's say that this right
over here is a farm,

00:01:22.057 --> 00:01:26.017
and this is my best drawing
of a field really fast,

00:01:26.017 --> 00:01:28.417
and so it needs to say
"Hey, you need to produce",

00:01:28.417 --> 00:01:31.305
I don't know, "10,000,000 apples,"

00:01:31.305 --> 00:01:32.138
I don't even know

00:01:32.138 --> 00:01:34.398
if that's a reasonable
amount of apples to produce

00:01:34.398 --> 00:01:36.731
but you need to produce 10,000,000 apples.

00:01:36.731 --> 00:01:39.814
And so the farmers who essentially
work for the government,

00:01:39.814 --> 00:01:41.296
'cause the government would own that farm,

00:01:41.296 --> 00:01:43.320
they would produce those apples.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.124
And also in a command
economy, there's like

00:01:45.124 --> 00:01:47.904
well who gets these cars
and who gets these apples?

00:01:47.904 --> 00:01:50.281
Well, in an extreme command economy,

00:01:50.281 --> 00:01:53.291
they will be directly
allocated by the government.

00:01:53.291 --> 00:01:54.232
The government will say,

00:01:54.232 --> 00:01:57.900
"Alright, you get a car, you
get a car, you get a car."

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.129
and it might not be based,

00:01:59.129 --> 00:02:01.801
and in fact it will not likely be based

00:02:01.801 --> 00:02:04.458
on any type who's willing
to pay for the car

00:02:04.458 --> 00:02:06.067
or who could pay the most for the car.

00:02:06.067 --> 00:02:08.861
Similarly, for the apples.

00:02:08.861 --> 00:02:10.616
So they are all gonna be allocated.

00:02:10.616 --> 00:02:12.347
So there will have to be
a lot of planning done

00:02:12.347 --> 00:02:14.712
on the part of the government to say,

00:02:14.712 --> 00:02:16.931
"Okay, how much should
we produce of one thing"

00:02:16.931 --> 00:02:19.540
"versus another thing
and how do we decide"

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.344
"who gets the different things?".

00:02:22.344 --> 00:02:25.099
Now the other side of the spectrum,

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.230
you have what's known as a market economy.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.194
And most economies in the world,

00:02:30.194 --> 00:02:32.253
especially the United
States, are much closer

00:02:32.253 --> 00:02:35.801
to being a market economy
than being a command economy.

00:02:35.801 --> 00:02:38.007
Rather than having the government owning

00:02:38.007 --> 00:02:40.995
the factors of production,
deciding who produces what

00:02:40.995 --> 00:02:42.969
and how much and who gets those things,

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:46.846
in a market economy, it's
all based on the factory

00:02:46.846 --> 00:02:50.416
right over here, independent
of the government

00:02:50.416 --> 00:02:52.673
for the most part unless
you're in certain fields

00:02:52.673 --> 00:02:55.112
that might have strong
influence from the government,

00:02:55.112 --> 00:02:56.804
let's say you're a military contractor.

00:02:56.804 --> 00:02:58.159
But if you're not in one of those fields,

00:02:58.159 --> 00:02:59.963
if you're fairly independent
of the government,

00:02:59.963 --> 00:03:00.900
what they would say is,

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.339
"Well, what does the market need?"

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:06.506
they might say, "Hey look,
the market needs 5,000 cars"

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.455
"That look like this
but then it also needs"

00:03:10.455 --> 00:03:14.038
"another 2,000 trucks
that look like that."

00:03:16.268 --> 00:03:17.462
and how are they basing it?

00:03:17.462 --> 00:03:18.842
Well, they might have looked in the past

00:03:18.842 --> 00:03:20.398
or how well is this car selling,

00:03:20.398 --> 00:03:21.460
how well is the truck selling.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.069
They might look at competitors,

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:24.727
in fact in a market economy,

00:03:24.727 --> 00:03:27.408
you'll often have more competition.

00:03:27.408 --> 00:03:28.503
The command economies,

00:03:28.503 --> 00:03:30.693
you might have one
really ginormous factory

00:03:30.693 --> 00:03:31.965
that's owned by the government or a few

00:03:31.965 --> 00:03:34.344
while here you might
have competing factories

00:03:34.344 --> 00:03:35.472
where they're always

00:03:35.472 --> 00:03:38.164
"Hey make a pretty good
car, we're gonna make one"

00:03:38.164 --> 00:03:41.445
"that's just as good
and it comes in yellow."

00:03:41.445 --> 00:03:43.907
So once again, you have
this notion of competition

00:03:43.907 --> 00:03:46.930
for people to produce
things out in the market

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.832
and they're also making
their best judgment

00:03:48.832 --> 00:03:51.771
of what does the market actually need.

00:03:51.771 --> 00:03:54.321
Similarly, you could have
your farmers here and you say,

00:03:54.321 --> 00:03:55.255
"Hey, you know what?"

00:03:55.255 --> 00:03:56.323
"I've been growing a lot of apples"

00:03:56.323 --> 00:03:57.874
"but that doesn't seem
to be in demand anymore"

00:03:57.874 --> 00:04:01.701
"so I'm going to grow more,
I don't know, peaches"

00:04:01.701 --> 00:04:03.379
"'cause it looks like the sale of peaches"

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:06.228
"are in fashion this year."

00:04:06.228 --> 00:04:07.785
and similarly, who gets these

00:04:07.785 --> 00:04:10.470
is not dictated by the government,

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.513
it's determined by the market.

00:04:12.513 --> 00:04:16.118
And so let's say this is
me, let's say this is you,

00:04:16.118 --> 00:04:18.795
let's say this is someone else.

00:04:18.795 --> 00:04:22.005
If I might not be interested
in getting a truck

00:04:22.005 --> 00:04:24.565
but I really need to get
a new car for my family

00:04:24.565 --> 00:04:27.401
so I can drive them around
and take vacations and things,

00:04:27.401 --> 00:04:29.856
and so let's say you wanna get a car too

00:04:29.856 --> 00:04:32.378
but the market will dictate who gets it.

00:04:32.378 --> 00:04:36.188
So for example, the factory
might set a prize for this car,

00:04:36.188 --> 00:04:39.771
they might say it is
10,000 dollars per car

00:04:40.711 --> 00:04:43.361
and maybe I'm willing to
pay it, maybe I'm not.

00:04:43.361 --> 00:04:45.090
Maybe I'm just like "Well I
really like that blue car"

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.739
"but I'm not willing
to pay 10,000 dollars"

00:04:46.739 --> 00:04:49.987
"and this yellow car is
available for 9,000 dollars"

00:04:49.987 --> 00:04:52.859
"so I'm going to get that."

00:04:52.859 --> 00:04:55.501
and the prices themselves
won't necessarily be fixed.

00:04:55.501 --> 00:04:56.951
If they're not selling
enough of these cars

00:04:56.951 --> 00:04:59.121
at 10,000 dollars, they
might lower the price

00:04:59.121 --> 00:05:02.161
to compete with the yellow
car at 9,000 dollars.

00:05:02.161 --> 00:05:04.194
Similarly, if there's a ton of people

00:05:04.194 --> 00:05:06.077
who are willing to pay
the price of this truck,

00:05:06.077 --> 00:05:08.039
they might raise the price on the truck

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:09.371
or produce more of it.

00:05:09.371 --> 00:05:11.007
In this severe competition,

00:05:11.007 --> 00:05:14.535
if one firm doesn't do this
well on a regular basis,

00:05:14.535 --> 00:05:15.368
they might go out of business.

00:05:15.368 --> 00:05:17.880
So there's a strong motivation

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.700
to be able to meet the needs of the market

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.338
and then the prices adjust accordingly.

00:05:23.338 --> 00:05:24.171
And so you might say,

00:05:24.171 --> 00:05:26.738
"well what are the
positives and negatives"

00:05:26.738 --> 00:05:28.270
"that people generally associate"

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.666
"with command economies
or market economies?".

00:05:31.666 --> 00:05:33.597
Well, the motivation that's often given

00:05:33.597 --> 00:05:37.896
for a command economy is
some notion of fairness

00:05:37.896 --> 00:05:40.570
or some notion of equality

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.897
that when you have a market economy,

00:05:42.897 --> 00:05:44.859
as a byproduct of this mechanism

00:05:44.859 --> 00:05:46.855
where different people are competing,

00:05:46.855 --> 00:05:49.065
some people are innovating more or less,

00:05:49.065 --> 00:05:52.124
some people might be
working harder or less,

00:05:52.124 --> 00:05:54.112
some people might just
get luckier or unluckier,

00:05:54.112 --> 00:05:58.195
you naturally will have
some level of inequality.

00:06:00.187 --> 00:06:03.842
And some of the original
ideas behind command economies

00:06:03.842 --> 00:06:07.404
like communism where hey we
don't like this inequality,

00:06:07.404 --> 00:06:08.855
we wanna see more fairness.

00:06:08.855 --> 00:06:11.916
And so we wanna see everyone
get exactly the same car.

00:06:11.916 --> 00:06:15.661
We wanna see everyone get exactly
the same number of apples.

00:06:15.661 --> 00:06:18.258
We don't wanna see all
of these competing firms,

00:06:18.258 --> 00:06:21.309
we want one really big, efficient factory

00:06:21.309 --> 00:06:24.029
to just churn out these cars.

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:26.222
Now it turns out in reality,

00:06:26.222 --> 00:06:27.918
that's a little bit utopian.

00:06:27.918 --> 00:06:31.546
Even at the peak of some of
these communist economies,

00:06:31.546 --> 00:06:34.717
there were people who had
better access to certain things.

00:06:34.717 --> 00:06:37.249
People who might have carried
favor with the leadership,

00:06:37.249 --> 00:06:40.615
had more power, who had better
apartments, better cars,

00:06:40.615 --> 00:06:43.713
had more access to resources
and people who didn't.

00:06:43.713 --> 00:06:45.335
In a market economy,

00:06:45.335 --> 00:06:48.105
yes, there will be some inequality,

00:06:48.105 --> 00:06:50.286
but the best thing going for it,

00:06:50.286 --> 00:06:52.438
and the reason why most
economies in the world,

00:06:52.438 --> 00:06:54.794
even ones that are nominally communist

00:06:54.794 --> 00:06:56.200
like the Chinese economy,

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.604
have transitioned to a market economy

00:06:58.604 --> 00:07:00.896
because a market economy
is also associated

00:07:00.896 --> 00:07:03.146
with things like innovation

00:07:05.616 --> 00:07:08.283
and strong incentives for people

00:07:09.449 --> 00:07:12.199
to innovate or work or do things.

00:07:13.269 --> 00:07:16.107
Think about the situation
in a command economy.

00:07:16.107 --> 00:07:18.585
Let's say that you're a
manager at this factory here.

00:07:18.585 --> 00:07:21.536
The government told you to
produce exactly 10,000 cars

00:07:21.536 --> 00:07:23.476
and exactly the type of model,

00:07:23.476 --> 00:07:24.309
maybe you have an idea

00:07:24.309 --> 00:07:27.024
for how to make this car more efficient,

00:07:27.024 --> 00:07:29.745
but no one is really
gonna reward you for that.

00:07:29.745 --> 00:07:31.512
If you're not gonna be
able to get paid more

00:07:31.512 --> 00:07:33.064
so that you can buy more things,

00:07:33.064 --> 00:07:35.825
you might not be as
interested in doing it.

00:07:35.825 --> 00:07:36.933
While in this situation,

00:07:36.933 --> 00:07:38.989
you have extreme competition

00:07:38.989 --> 00:07:41.699
where as soon as this
factory or this company

00:07:41.699 --> 00:07:42.914
is outselling this one,

00:07:42.914 --> 00:07:45.531
everyone here is gonna think
"Wow, we need to innovate."

00:07:45.531 --> 00:07:47.110
"We need to really work harder"

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:49.983
"so that we can take more market share"

00:07:49.983 --> 00:07:52.027
"from the other company."

00:07:52.027 --> 00:07:53.512
Similarly, at the individual level,

00:07:53.512 --> 00:07:54.690
different people might say

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:56.489
"Hey, I can only afford
the yellow car now"

00:07:56.489 --> 00:07:59.164
"but gee, I really wish
I had the blue car"

00:07:59.164 --> 00:08:01.021
"so maybe I'm gonna work
a little bit harder"

00:08:01.021 --> 00:08:02.097
"or I'm gonna try to innovate"

00:08:02.097 --> 00:08:03.837
"or I'm gonna try to start a business."

00:08:03.837 --> 00:08:06.900
most of the world has
transitioned to something

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:10.475
much closer to a market
economy because overall,

00:08:10.475 --> 00:08:12.695
even though you have this inequality,

00:08:12.695 --> 00:08:16.373
it has made more
productivity, more innovation,

00:08:16.373 --> 00:08:20.088
more goods and services
available to more people.

00:08:20.088 --> 00:08:22.671
Now the reality is most
economies, as I mentioned,

00:08:22.671 --> 00:08:24.340
they're close to a market economy,

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:26.550
but aren't a perfect market economy.

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:29.552
You still have the
government very involved

00:08:29.552 --> 00:08:30.949
in certain industries.

00:08:30.949 --> 00:08:32.001
In many economies,

00:08:32.001 --> 00:08:35.682
the government might be
in control of healthcare.

00:08:35.682 --> 00:08:37.305
The government in almost every country

00:08:37.305 --> 00:08:41.205
has significant influence
in things like the military.

00:08:41.205 --> 00:08:43.285
The government, in say the United States

00:08:43.285 --> 00:08:45.337
which is considered a fairly capitalist,

00:08:45.337 --> 00:08:47.164
a fairly strong market economy,

00:08:47.164 --> 00:08:50.286
the government still does
offer social safety nets

00:08:50.286 --> 00:08:52.407
when the inequality gets too extreme.

00:08:52.407 --> 00:08:54.382
If someone isn't able to feed themselves,

00:08:54.382 --> 00:08:55.626
they might get food stamps.

00:08:55.626 --> 00:08:57.964
If someone isn't able to get
healthcare because of poverty,

00:08:57.964 --> 00:08:59.419
they might get Medicaid.

00:08:59.419 --> 00:09:01.686
And so there's actually a spectrum

00:09:01.686 --> 00:09:05.709
between a command economy
and a market economy.

00:09:05.709 --> 00:09:07.757
With most economies
actually falling in this

00:09:07.757 --> 00:09:10.916
inbetween state which
is sometimes referred to

00:09:10.916 --> 00:09:12.499
as a mixed economy.

00:09:13.866 --> 00:09:15.461
For example, as I already mentioned,

00:09:15.461 --> 00:09:17.192
the United States which is considered

00:09:17.192 --> 00:09:19.533
a very capitalist country
with a market economy,

00:09:19.533 --> 00:09:22.846
it still does have some public ownership.

00:09:22.846 --> 00:09:26.130
The government still does
control certain aspects

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:27.798
of the economy, it still represents

00:09:27.798 --> 00:09:30.602
a fairly large chunk of the economy.

00:09:30.602 --> 00:09:33.272
And so a pure command economy government

00:09:33.272 --> 00:09:34.722
would control everything,

00:09:34.722 --> 00:09:37.063
pure market economy, you
would have very little

00:09:37.063 --> 00:09:38.612
that's controlled by the government,

00:09:38.612 --> 00:09:40.549
but the reality in most of the world,

00:09:40.549 --> 00:09:43.559
things fall in this
mixed economy spectrum.
