00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.120
A major obstacle to self-knowledge and in
turn, to a flourishing life, is our tendency

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.040
to lie to ourselves.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:27.840
We lie for a very understandable
reason: because we want to avoid pain.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.800
There are four things we particularly like to lie
to ourselves about: Things we need to change

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.680
about our lives. Things that might disturb
our self-image. Things we badly want and can't

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.080
have. Things we are angry with orthers about
but don't dare to express. Here are some of the leading manoeuvers we employ to kid ourselves.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.040
1. Addiction.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.120
*Pornography noises*

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.600
We identify something that can powerfully keep our thoughts
away from troubling inner confrontations.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.760
Often, we don't so much like what distracts
us in and of itself: we get attached because

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:25.120
of its ability to keep us away from what we
fear.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.480
2. Manic Cheeriness.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:36.080
Guys I just want to propse a toast to friendship and yeah just to having great times together. I'm so glad

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.360
you came, I hope your all having fun.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.280
A sadness we haven't been able to admit to is often covered up withexaggerated doses of manic cheeriness.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.800
Are you having fun? Yeah Yeah.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.351
I'm so happy, it's so nice to see you. Yeah
you too. It's really lovely, it's really fun

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.520
it's been really fun.You look amazing.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.720
We aren't happy so much as incapable of allowing ourselves to feel even the slightest sadness, in case we were to be overwhelmed by our troubling feelings.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.160
3. Denigration.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.400
I'm pleased I didn't go to university. I know you met alot of people

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.080
and that you're friends for life but I don't
think that paying 9000 a year to make friends

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.600
is really the best use of my money. Especially if i'm going to have to pay that back.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.781
We tell ourselves that we simply don't care about something - not because that's true, but because we can't have it.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.230
I have got a friend that
does contempary movement practise. I learnt

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:36.269
to walk when I was little I don't need to...
I just learnt myself. You fall over you get

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:41.440
up, I don't need a tutor to tell me, you know
this is how movement looks in the 20th century.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.880
I just sit at the bus stop.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.160
4. Censoriousness.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:54.319
So it was the village counciller. There all in the bed and breakfast and that's where
it begins. It's this kind of orgy situation

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:59.840
and I think first of all it's abuse of power.
But why people need to commit to group sex?

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:00.800
I find it so weird.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.280
We can often grow censorious
and disapproving of certain people and behaviours

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.880
to ward off an awareness that a part of us
in fact really likes the condemmed element.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.720
and kind of creepy and discusting, I just.
I do not want to be in a harness doing that

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.880
kind of thing. I'm just not interested.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.960
When our feelings get tricky, we attack them in someone else.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.040
I think it's disgusting. I don't understand why someone needs to have multiple partners.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.640
5. Defensiveness.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.960
Because you're
so strong, so good and talented and it is

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.160
very unique I think actually you know what
would happen if you just stripped it all back

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.951
and took away all the bells and whistles the
effects and just kind of just went just you

00:03:46.951 --> 00:03:54.670
just the guitar. Wow. that's rude to sit there
and just. Well it's quite arrogent to tell

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:02.500
me what you think I should do with what i'm
doing. What do you even know about music?

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.970
You just press buttons and stuff don't you? Just press play and pause. You don't actually

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:15.200
create any music. So for you to tell me what to do with mine is just really, it comes across really full of yourself.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.840
Feeling offended
takes up all our attention. It muddies the

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.330
waters. When we are defensive, we no longer
pay attention to information that may - at

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:23.760
its heart - be correct but challenging.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.240
Like
you don't know what you're talking about i

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:33.120
know what i'm doing with my music and if it doesn't appeal to you I'm sorry but you probably

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.280
don't kind of know the genre that i'm going for. Or the feeling. Maybe I'm not going for a genre.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.320
The problem with lying to ourselves
is that in so doing. We miss out on key opportunities for growth.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:53.600
Don't tell me how to do my craft
in front of my friends. I know what I'm doing.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.040
You get it. You get it. You absolutely get
it.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.520
The things we're in denial about are painful.  But usually also contain crucial material that's vital to our overall development.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:07.680
I'm so much happier being single. You know even the movies are good on your own. I didn't

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.240
know that I thought it was a couple thing
but even that's good now. I've got more space in the appartment.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.040
If we could face up to our stranger thoughts, needs and desires.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.760
We'd learn to navigate more freely in our
minds and our honesty would render us more

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.600
creative, interesting and pleasant to be around.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:32.000
At the school of life we believe in developing emotional intelligence. To that end we've also created a whole range of products to

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.960
support that growth. Find out more at the
