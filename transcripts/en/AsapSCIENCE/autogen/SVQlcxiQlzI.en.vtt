00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.319
 Tired? We all know this feeling. Are you agitated? Stooped, and too lazy? 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:10.370
 Looks like you did not sleep enough last night ... or the last few nights. But what time is enough 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.800
 Who needs sleep? More importantly, can we meet that need? 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.339
 While the same sleep function is still debated by scientists, but we know that our feedback is yet to come 

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:22.539
 Adequate sleep should be good. On the whole, we spend 24 years of our lives 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:26.909
 In sleep, it is best to have this important topic. The researchers tested enough sleep time per night 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:31.489
 Through long-term testing on groups of people sleep 4, 6, and 8 hours 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:36.500
 After 14 days, the results showed that those who slept for 8 hours showed fewer mental deficits. 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:42.210
 Those who slept 6 or 4 hours showed a significantly lower mental response. In fact, after 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.149
 Only two weeks of a 6-hour group showed a similar reaction to people whose blood alcohol ratio was equivalent 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:52.699
 Concentration of 0.10%, which is legally drunk. Those who sleep 4 hours suffer more ... 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:57.160
 And sometimes sleep while taking mental and cognitive tests. In both groups ... 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.899
 Day after day,
