Speaker 1:          00:00          This is Radiolab. I'm Jad Abumrad. And I'm Robert Krulwich. In this hour we are looking at [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:06          Wait.

Speaker 1:          00:07          Oh, who was that? I'm sorry. Okay, here we have the laugh box. That's a strange little device that Robert Provan from the University of Maryland Plate. Remember him from the previous heck yeah, he played it to me. And he has

Speaker 2:          00:17          the notion about this. Yeah. So basically you just need laughter, you know, cause weapon. The notion here is you don't need a joke to start the laugh. All you need is a laugh. You can throw the joke away. Laughter causes laughter. No, you can't get a laugh going from there.

Speaker 1:          00:32          Well actually actually you can. And he said I'll prove it to you. So he showed me a video tape. This was at in the mall.

Speaker 3:          00:39          Excuse me. Hi. We're doing a study on the laughter. Laughter. A good thing. Absolutely. You'll laugh a lot. I laugh every day. I make my wife laugh. All ready. What do you do that makes him laugh? Trip spills a lot of things. What are the thing? We have a piece of apparatus here. You pushed the button before

Speaker 4:          01:10          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          01:17          why were you laughing? Did anyone tell a joke? Anyone do anything funny,

Speaker 1:          01:35          easy. What's true? Provide is absolutely correct about this. What we're dealing here is something that's very contagious.

Speaker 5:          01:46          [inaudible] um, I'm, I'll go gray.

Speaker 1:          01:49          All right. Well, well while we are on the subject of contagious laughter, I've got a story to tell you.

Speaker 5:          01:54          We are filming.

Speaker 1:          02:00          You want to, all right, now imagine you Whitney. Yeah. Imagine 1960 [inaudible] I would just sit here, eyes your attention. I mean, Oh yes. 1962. Yeah. Rural village of Catia, Tanzania, girls boarding school. When a girl is sitting in class, she begins to laugh. The girl next to her maybe turned left. Here's her laugh. And she begins to cross the classroom with their girl joins in and the teacher gets upset, but it's too soon for girls in eighth. The entire class has begun to laugh and then cry and then laugh, cry and the cow. What? Just cause I don't know. [inaudible] anyhow, a girl outside at that moment, walking down the hall to imagine she hears the laughter from the classroom. She started still laugh. And as she walks in, laughs her laughter goes into other classrooms and soon the whole school is doing this laughing, crying, laughing, crying. Teachers cannot control these girls when they try to, the girls get violent, they could play one. Yup. And the principal then has choice.

Speaker 6:          03:00          He's got to close the school. They opened the school a week later and it happens again soon. They closed the school a second time. Meanwhile, the girls who started all this, they go back to their villages many, many miles away and this thing, whatever it is, spreads up and down the coast of Lake Victoria. You mean? People in the villages start to play in one village, 217 people start to laugh and cry. A second boarding school has to shut down and no one knows why. So a team of doctors, some British doctors in the area and they hop in a land rover and they rush out to investigate this strange phenomenon

Speaker 7:          03:38          and this is what they write. The Central African Journal of Medicine, volume nine number five, May, 1963 the disease commenced on 30th of January, 1962 to mission among girls and middle school at Kosha. The onset is sudden with a tax of laughing and crying lasting for a few minutes to a few hours to a maximum of 16 days by spite and then a recurrence in the report there was an account of a 52 year old man who saw some people afflicted with a sickness. I'm soon after we're turning to his heart, he felt something telling him to laugh and cry and shout. There's, he continued to do for most of the night.

Speaker 6:          04:17          No fatal cases have been reported. This is very, what is this true? Well, okay. We wondered. Okay. So we sent our producer Ellen Horn 40 some odd years after the fact to see what she could find. I'm flying to [inaudible] to be honest, I was a little bit worried that I can see the sun setting over Lake Victoria that uh, that the medical journal article just wasn't true. Yes. With that's yeah. Cause that's cause what I expected. Was this a total hoax? Yeah. Or that it was some kind of like stunt getting close. It just sort of doubted the general credibility of the, of the whole thing. Okay. We'll be correcting the BACOPA. Okay. So I get to recall baptist totally in the most beautiful place. The cover is a tiny port town. It's green and lush and this very remote part of northern Tanzania in the morning. And my first step was just to spend a couple of days walking around and asking everybody that I ran into who spoke English.

Speaker 6:          05:20          So I'm asking them about this contagious laughter, but demic of laughter I guess I imagined, you know, this happened in the in the sixties so I'm looking for people who are like in their seventies and eighties turns out that I didn't need old people and young people totally new. But I was talking about I, yeah, I totally know what you mean because it still happens today. The first time I saw it, it was in 1991 I went to this tour office and the first person I met there was this guy named Raymond Raymond. When he said he thought he could find me, somebody who had I maybe forgive me three hours, I can find those. I can give you my phone number. About an hour later I get a text from him that says, meet me in a half hour hop in his car. We drive off to, how did you find this person? I know he's not kidding. Raymond is a former Tanzania national soccer team star. He's like a local celebrity, like kids follow him down the street, so Raymond drives me up this dirt road about 10 minutes we get to this blue cement building. We sit outside on the porch and these white plastic chairs and we just, we wait.

Speaker 6:          06:35          Hello. After about 20 minutes, this woman comes out really beautiful, has a mole on her nose at long eyelashes or she'll introduce herself for me. She's nervously squeezing this plastic water bottle. It's in her hand. [inaudible] can Chester is her name. [inaudible]. She tells me that in her high school there were three girls who are affected chicka Chicka for all of them in happen during exams. Yeah. What do you remember what the test was about? It was the morning of the math test. She remembers walking into the exam room. She sat down, she looked at her paper and suddenly [inaudible] something came over her. She started laughing and then she took a photo class C and e community and then she says she doesn't remember much ups from that. She's told that she fought. When they tried to restrain her, she spent three days in the hospital. They would give her Valium, make her pass out.

Speaker 6:          07:48          Then she'd wake up, feel a little bit better for a while and then it would come on again. She'd uncontrollably be laughing. Then they would give her more Valium. She'd pass out. Why do you think this happens? A little gun in a c tree, she says, happens for girls, right, are not free. And so I asked her if she felt free, like I'm not even sure what they're talking about, but I asked her if she felt free and she said, I need a quote or I can establish you live with your parents, what can you're that age, no one's really free. She said she had a boyfriend and her parents wouldn't let her see him. But in the hospital when she had the laughing sickness, he was allowed to come visit and he definitely [inaudible].

Speaker 6:          08:34          So this girl has a crazy attack of laughing and then her boyfriend shows up and she's just fine. Well, we're more like, she's allowed to see her boyfriend. So it's about the wall. She's, I mean, the real common association with this, with the sicknesses that it's a teenage girl disease happens to grow. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Again, 16 to 20 years old crying and sometimes laughy talk to a school nurse, a psychiatric nurse from the local hospital, a doctor, and they all said vaguely the same thing. The reason it happened was that it had something to do with the transitions of adolescence. And, and just out of curiosity, you're a girl. Is there something about this that makes sense to you? Terrorists. Yes. Out of Cura. Yeah, sure. So do you know you're just beginning to kind of negotiate your relationship to sex and boys and there's these new pressures and these new responsibilities that are really challenging. It's funny, boys don't, don't have that problem. We just want to have sex and it's a crisis for girls. Yeah. So it does kind of make sense. Okay. But it doesn't really explain anything about 1962 to me. Why not? Because in 1962 it wasn't just teenage girls, it was boys. It was men. It was villages full of people of all ages. So what explains that?

Speaker 8:          10:01          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          10:02          personally for me, found a woman who was there. Hello. That's good. Gertrude is in her fifties she's got short loose curls and big smiles. And in 1962 when the laughter epidemic struck her village, she got it too.

Speaker 9:          10:18          Six years old. Very young. Do you remember? I remember his, yeah. Sheer ever seen hundreds of people coming down with this strange affliction. I took many forms. Some were laughing, everlasting laughter, then laugh and cry at the same thing at the same time.

Speaker 10:         10:44          [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          10:46          what happened to me was I was not able to talk, crying only, and then my eyes were closed as if there is a it gum on my eyes, so my mom, she called me on her back and they walked.

Speaker 6:          11:05          They walked over the hills when her mom carrying her on her back for hours and along the way, they ran into other people, boys, girls, men even. Oh, Dylan's dozens of people all headed the same way. Laughing, crying. I have been yet the skin. Where are they going to? The witch doctor did this. Which note? I didn't know what else to do. [inaudible] hundreds of people. She says, converged on this woman's tiny hut, so do going east. A 10 by 10 in the house. They will have fool. They hit to stay outside. They are mini because there were so many people going to many people. Those daily, Boom. What do you think the problem was? Oh, okay. I was asking my Erda ones

Speaker 9:          11:49          Tuesday problem. They said that it was something like spiritual, a spiritual event, because one year before this program there we are sitting in seats.

Speaker 6:          12:08          She said that about a year before the laughter epidemic, Caterpillar's had shown up. They were breathing in the spread all over the ground. There was this huge infestation. One of the explanations was that the people who got sick had walked across the caterpillar. They stepped on this caterpillars and had killed them. As a result, the spirit of the caterpillars were possessing they that they to get this feeling. Now she sort of dismissed that. That's not scientific, but maybe this caterpillar head is eating bacterias which affected debris. Okay. This explanation that there was some sort of bacteria or virus I had already checked today, I had gone to the Government Hospital [inaudible] to talk to the medical officer and insurance. They've never found any physical costs for this. Not in the medical importance, which was found. I'd even talked to a lab technician. I've looked at the technician who had checked blood samples in 1962 everything was negative. They tested the water supply, the food supply. You get people negative so that the cattle fillers seemed like a dead end. So I tried a different tech. I asked Gertrude what was going on then at that time in your village and she thought about it for awhile and then she said you look well he's winning. Of course there was independence. Independence.

Speaker 11:         13:32          Whoa.

Speaker 6:          13:32          For 40 years Tanzania had been a British colony but 1961 Tanzania had declared independence and this was right before, just weeks before that first girl started laughing. [inaudible] I don't know much about independence. What can you tell me about independence? What they experienced by then was people going alone seeing Ethan drums.

Speaker 11:         14:00          Dan seeing cause the [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          14:05          but the but from that I can tell more routine dependence cause I was very, very young. Gertrude said that she knew somebody who would remember more. Someone I should talk to. [inaudible] 71 year old man. Mr Sauce was se thing deal, which looked at, he was the witchdoctors. This assistant may be, this man can help more than I do. You want some coffee or some breakfast here first, how? My very last day in the Cobra, Raymond and I sat down with this map and which doctor's assistant had a restaurant near my hotel. It's a tiny guy, gray hair and big oversized suit and he filled in some of the missing pieces.

Speaker 6:          14:52          When you tell him, I want to know what he remembers. I asked him about the independence celebration that Gertrude described. [inaudible] the ones just before the laughter epidemic. [inaudible] he painted a very different picture. I didn't remember [inaudible]. He was 26 at the time. Kenny MCHA is teens and after the parties died down, he said, change [inaudible] swept through his village to do jewel. Does that Buddha? It can you cut out cause I would've [inaudible] [inaudible] following independence, Tanzania became a socialist state and the new government was out to create a new world order. Lamb changed hands. They abolished the local clan, the president, president [inaudible]. After the independence and the local religions, the bond, the speech, this was the brand new age. This is the new era. You were supposed to have a modern belief system. The entire village was being asked to abandon the way that they had worshiped for thousands of years.

Speaker 6:          16:00          You can tweak it [inaudible] within weeks. The church has moved out. Yeah, but it's okay. Lee, they had business. Catholic church opened up on one side of the street. Now Lutheran on the other patients were [inaudible] people convincing [inaudible] to join different really tins. They even handed out money. It was kind of a bidding war for souls. All of it was too new, too fast. The tool does that. Buddha Sassy, he even remembers this one particular night that would assassin. Everyone in his village gathered outside. Rafa stared at the Sky Kupuna and whizzy they had been told that was the end of life on f uh, to me the night everybody was out the all night waiting to see whether the moon today, a couple of hours, he told me we saw that heavens and the moon. She did too slamming into each other. Can you cut out cause I've sequel [inaudible] what they saw, it was a scoped them. That's what they see.

Speaker 6:          17:24          Got It. Maybe that was the end of the world of that old world. Here's the sky, the switched doctors assistant who introduced himself to me actually as an elected official made this jump in his life that that was a particular period of time when everybody was making this big jump all of the sudden. So you think that this laughing epidemic had something to do with it? Like an avalanche of newness? Yeah, well the explanations I came across, this is the one that makes the most sense to me. It's plausible to me too, cause you're, you got a loss of religion and arrival of a new religion, a loss of a political culture, a new leader. And that's a very large pile up of change all of a sudden. Yeah. And of course everyone's a little bit scared. So there's a quiet and then someone starts to laugh. You know, who knows why that first girl went crazy and why she started making crazy laughing noises. But it was like people saw that and they were like, Oh God, I feel like that too. It sounds like laughter. But you could think of it as as like a collective scream or something. Yeah, like the entire society was a 16 year old girl
