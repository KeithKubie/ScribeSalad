physics matter and antimatter are almost

strange as I often like to say in the

antimatter seems strange because we

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730
antimatter seems strange because we
 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.479
antimatter seems strange because we
rarely see it why because hardly any of

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489
rarely see it why because hardly any of
 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:42.729
rarely see it why because hardly any of
it exists in the universe but if the

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739
it exists in the universe but if the
 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:44.139
it exists in the universe but if the
universe were made of antimatter it

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149
universe were made of antimatter it
 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:45.959

would look exactly the same auntie

00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:45.969
would look exactly the same auntie

lovers could sit in auntie cars under an

everything would seem exactly the same
so why do we live in a universe that has

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780
so why do we live in a universe that has
 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.689
so why do we live in a universe that has
only matter and no antimatter that's one

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699
only matter and no antimatter that's one
 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:57.880
only matter and no antimatter that's one
of the biggest mysteries in fact that's

of the biggest mysteries in fact that's
 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.829
of the biggest mysteries in fact that's
been driving particle physics and

should I have equal amounts of matter

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330
should I have equal amounts of matter
 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.330
should I have equal amounts of matter
and antimatter how would you end up with

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340
and antimatter how would you end up with
 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.969
and antimatter how would you end up with
a universe in which for every particle

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979
a universe in which for every particle
 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.149
a universe in which for every particle
of antimatter there may be more than 10

billion particles of matter these are

questions we have ideas about how to
answer but we don't yet know exactly how

answer but we don't yet know exactly how
 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:23.530
answer but we don't yet know exactly how
to answer and that's one of the reasons

to answer and that's one of the reasons
 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.660
to answer and that's one of the reasons
why we're looking out in the universe to

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670
why we're looking out in the universe to
 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.960
why we're looking out in the universe to
confirm in fact the processes that might

confirm in fact the processes that might
 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.389
confirm in fact the processes that might
create matter instead of antimatter and

create matter instead of antimatter and

producing lots of antimatter we don't
