SAM CHAUDHARY:
ClassDojo is a platform

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.350
that helps teachers
and parents build

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:10.820
character strengths with kids.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.520
Teachers use the
ClassDojo mobile app

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.985
to give kids positive feedback
in the classroom for all

00:00:15.985 --> 00:00:17.740
the things they're doing well.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.240
And then they collect
all this data,

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.236
which they share
with parents at home.

00:00:21.236 --> 00:00:23.110
LIAM DON: We probably
spoke to-- Sam actually

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.230
spoke to about 200
teachers on the phone.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.770
What they kept telling us was
that they had this big problem

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.611
that they were facing
regarding behavior.

00:00:29.611 --> 00:00:31.110
The more we talked
to them, the more

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.622
we became convinced
that this was something

00:00:32.622 --> 00:00:33.539
that we had to tackle.

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:35.038
KALEN GALLAGHER:
It's crazy to think

00:00:35.038 --> 00:00:36.960
that three years ago,
ClassDojo didn't exist.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.480
And now I think there's close
to two million teachers who

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.144
use us.

00:00:40.144 --> 00:00:41.810
We're in front of
around 40 million kids

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.600
everyday in 28 languages
in 148 countries.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.640
The list goes on.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.480
If teachers like something,
it will spread that quickly.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.970
Teachers want to be able to
walk around the classroom

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.015
and perform without
being tied to a computer.

00:00:53.015 --> 00:00:55.690
And so we started
looking at building

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.930
a native app for Google Play.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.140
And with the launch of
Google Play for Education,

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.880
that was a natural
fit for us to dive in.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.880
LIAM DON: So we want to reach
as many teachers as possible.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.000
And what we found was
Google Play for Education

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.810
was a great way to
do that because we

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.479
have all this
visibility on the store.

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.520
We like the fact that we
can push instant updates

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.040
because that allows us to
respond to user demands

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.090
quite quickly.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.110
I think one of my
top pieces of advice

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.060
for other developers in the
Google Play for Education store

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.360
is to really think about the
seasonality of education.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.610
You'll see much better results
if you launch something

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.193
in the fall when
teachers are actually

00:01:27.193 --> 00:01:28.280
making adoption decisions.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.020
KALEN GALLAGHER: Localizing
the app makes a lot of sense.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.436
Here in the United
States, there's

00:01:31.436 --> 00:01:33.750
a lot of people who
are changing the app

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.200
language because their
native tongue is not English.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.120
LIAM DON: It's really
important for them

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.470
to have a simple experience
that they can use very easily.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.011
It's important for them to be
able to install your app easily

00:01:42.011 --> 00:01:43.390
and sign into it very easily.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.715
And that's where I think
Google Play for Education

00:01:44.715 --> 00:01:46.024
has been really helpful.

00:01:46.024 --> 00:01:48.440
SAM CHAUDHARY: I think one of
ClassDojo's proudest moments

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.170
was about two months ago when
we passed this amazing milestone

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.510
for the company, which
was a billion pieces

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.450
of positive feedback given
by teachers to students.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.600
That was pretty exciting.
