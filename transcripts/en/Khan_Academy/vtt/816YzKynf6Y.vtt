00:00:00.869 --> 00:00:05.017
- [Salman] Welcome to the Khan
Academy 2016 Annual Report.

00:00:05.017 --> 00:00:06.385
In the actual text of the report,

00:00:06.385 --> 00:00:08.138
we're going to go into a lot more detail

00:00:08.138 --> 00:00:10.138
on the financials and other things,

00:00:10.138 --> 00:00:12.534
but I'm hoping here to
give you an overview.

00:00:12.534 --> 00:00:13.677
Big picture,

00:00:13.677 --> 00:00:16.927
2016 was a great year for Khan Academy.

00:00:17.803 --> 00:00:20.339
The impact has continued to grow

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:23.534
in the double-digit percentages
and is accelerating.

00:00:23.534 --> 00:00:26.170
So one of the areas that
we've really started

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.430
to accelerate in 2016 was
in content development.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.230
Many people associate Khan
Academy with mathematics,

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.901
but what we've really been investing in

00:00:34.901 --> 00:00:36.643
is going beyond mathematics.

00:00:36.643 --> 00:00:39.488
We really want to cover all
of the core academic subjects

00:00:39.488 --> 00:00:41.557
that you consider to be
part of your education,

00:00:41.557 --> 00:00:44.213
all the way through the core of college.

00:00:44.213 --> 00:00:46.741
And it's not just videos,
we're doing a lot on practice,

00:00:46.741 --> 00:00:49.447
and we're doing a lot of written articles.

00:00:49.447 --> 00:00:51.957
2016 was a very big deal

00:00:51.957 --> 00:00:54.945
in terms of a partnership
with the College Board.

00:00:54.945 --> 00:00:56.826
A few years ago, they reached out to us,

00:00:56.826 --> 00:00:59.190
said, "We are going to revamp the SAT,

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.855
"and as part of that we
want to address at least

00:01:01.855 --> 00:01:04.873
"the perception of inequity
that's been around for decades."

00:01:04.873 --> 00:01:07.411
And the reason why they wanted
to partner with Khan Academy

00:01:07.411 --> 00:01:10.950
is traditional test prep was
associated with gaming an exam.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.680
It wasn't about real learning.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.289
But they saw that we were
focused on filling in gaps

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:16.725
in students understanding,

00:01:16.725 --> 00:01:18.753
so we launched with the College Board.

00:01:18.753 --> 00:01:21.362
And what we've seen over
the course of the year is

00:01:21.362 --> 00:01:23.272
Khan Academy is now used more than

00:01:23.272 --> 00:01:25.775
all of paid test prep combined,

00:01:25.775 --> 00:01:29.594
and we're seeing that usage
very broad and very deep.

00:01:29.594 --> 00:01:32.480
And what's been even more
exciting is the PSAT,

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.645
which is taken in 10th or 11th grade

00:01:34.645 --> 00:01:37.961
by 80% of American high school students.

00:01:37.961 --> 00:01:40.989
In the past, that was just a
random practice test you took,

00:01:40.989 --> 00:01:43.838
but now it acts as a
diagnostic for Khan Academy.

00:01:43.838 --> 00:01:45.652
You can take your PSAT scores,

00:01:45.652 --> 00:01:47.514
give permission to Khan Academy,

00:01:47.514 --> 00:01:48.924
and then Khan Academy software

00:01:48.924 --> 00:01:50.257
knows your strengths and weaknesses,

00:01:50.257 --> 00:01:53.263
not just in math but in
reading and writing as well,

00:01:53.263 --> 00:01:55.469
and can immediately
give you practice items

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:57.640
that are essentially weak point training.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.658
And even more powerful, we've
been able to follow students

00:02:00.658 --> 00:02:04.078
from that PSAT through
their work on Khan Academy

00:02:04.078 --> 00:02:06.087
to eventually taking the SAT,

00:02:06.087 --> 00:02:10.160
to understand the efficacy
of this entire ecosystem.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.148
And what you see here on this slide

00:02:12.148 --> 00:02:14.638
are some of the preliminary
results for arguably

00:02:14.638 --> 00:02:17.750
the largest personalized
learning study ever conducted.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.796
With over 300,000 students,

00:02:19.796 --> 00:02:22.748
we saw that those who
prepared on Khan Academy

00:02:22.748 --> 00:02:26.169
for at least 20 hours saw twice the growth

00:02:26.169 --> 00:02:29.531
from the PSAT to the SAT than
they would typically see,

00:02:29.531 --> 00:02:31.159
and this is just the beginning.

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:33.161
We're working with the
College Board very closely

00:02:33.161 --> 00:02:34.917
to do even further studies,

00:02:34.917 --> 00:02:37.974
and we've also seen that it
doesn't stop at 20 hours.

00:02:37.974 --> 00:02:40.358
The more time that
students put in practice,

00:02:40.358 --> 00:02:42.477
the more gains were seen.

00:02:42.477 --> 00:02:45.548
Another really exciting event in 2016

00:02:45.548 --> 00:02:48.567
is that Duck Duck Moose
became part of Khan Academy.

00:02:48.567 --> 00:02:50.632
Duck Duck Moose, I would argue,

00:02:50.632 --> 00:02:53.564
was the best early learning
app company out there.

00:02:53.564 --> 00:02:56.035
In 2016, the founding team

00:02:56.035 --> 00:02:58.986
said, "We would rather see our
work having a social mission

00:02:58.986 --> 00:03:01.001
"and reaching as many
students as possible,

00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:04.020
"especially those that are most in need."

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.890
And so they became part
of our team in 2016.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:07.967
And going forward,

00:03:07.967 --> 00:03:10.614
we're going to be working
on early learning apps

00:03:10.614 --> 00:03:14.365
that holistically approach
reading, writing, mathematics,

00:03:14.365 --> 00:03:16.063
starting at pre-kindergarten

00:03:16.063 --> 00:03:20.195
and then taking students
through early elementary school.

00:03:20.195 --> 00:03:21.926
International continues to be

00:03:21.926 --> 00:03:23.881
a very big part of Khan Academy.

00:03:23.881 --> 00:03:28.113
Roughly 1/3 of our usage is
outside of the United States.

00:03:28.113 --> 00:03:32.729
We have increased our focus
on India, Mexico, and Brazil.

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:35.906
And going forward, we're
building tools and platforms

00:03:35.906 --> 00:03:38.944
to allow each geography
to be even more localized

00:03:38.944 --> 00:03:41.246
to their specific needs.

00:03:41.246 --> 00:03:44.477
And going forward, there's
a lot of exciting things.

00:03:44.477 --> 00:03:45.929
What you see here is a screenshot

00:03:45.929 --> 00:03:47.778
for the student-facing experience

00:03:47.778 --> 00:03:50.051
for back to school 2017,

00:03:50.051 --> 00:03:51.980
where students can tell Khan Academy

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.610
what classes they're taking,

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.061
what grade they're in,

00:03:55.061 --> 00:03:57.518
and then Khan Academy
can personalize to them.

00:03:57.518 --> 00:03:59.407
And also, I have game mechanics

00:03:59.407 --> 00:04:02.498
so that the students are
motivated to move forward.

00:04:02.498 --> 00:04:04.420
You can see that right over here,

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.101
once you get into a unit page.

00:04:07.101 --> 00:04:08.809
Of course, you see the videos.

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:10.790
You see the practice items here.

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.663
But we are also adding diagnostic quizzes

00:04:13.663 --> 00:04:16.180
and unit tests as well.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.800
What you see here is our
assignments functionality,

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.434
where a teacher can assign any piece

00:04:20.434 --> 00:04:22.169
of content on Khan Academy.

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.950
This is a teacher assigning
some practice content.

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.460
They can assign it to particular students

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.750
in a particular class.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.187
They can set a due date.

00:04:30.187 --> 00:04:31.539
They can then see a readout

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:36.169
of which students completed
which assignments.

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:37.734
And then they can see

00:04:37.734 --> 00:04:40.890
which items gave the
students the most difficulty

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.903
so that they can review
it in class the next day.

00:04:43.903 --> 00:04:45.348
On top of all of this,

00:04:45.348 --> 00:04:47.297
we have a program called LearnStorm,

00:04:47.297 --> 00:04:48.729
which is a learning challenge

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:51.396
that schools, teachers,
students participate in

00:04:51.396 --> 00:04:53.588
that celebrate the growth mindset.

00:04:53.588 --> 00:04:56.066
The more students can
show grit, perseverance,

00:04:56.066 --> 00:04:58.521
as they work through
practice on Khan Academy,

00:04:58.521 --> 00:05:00.509
the more awards and recognition

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:02.682
the students, their
classrooms, their teachers,

00:05:02.682 --> 00:05:04.246
and their schools will get.

00:05:04.246 --> 00:05:06.977
We've piloted it in several
geographies in the past,

00:05:06.977 --> 00:05:08.919
and 2017 is going to be the first time

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:12.252
that we do this on a nationwide scale.

00:05:12.252 --> 00:05:14.431
So there's a lot going on at Khan Academy.

00:05:14.431 --> 00:05:17.667
What I just covered is
really just a sample of it.

00:05:17.667 --> 00:05:20.831
But we're really grateful
for your support.

00:05:20.831 --> 00:05:22.178
We have a big mission,

00:05:22.178 --> 00:05:25.822
a free, world-class education
for anyone, anywhere.

00:05:25.822 --> 00:05:29.594
And some of y'all have been
with us for many years.

00:05:29.594 --> 00:05:34.230
When we were just starting in
2007, out of a walk-in closet,

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:37.524
this type of a mission would've
seemed, frankly, delusional.

00:05:37.524 --> 00:05:40.337
But because of your
support, your partnership,

00:05:40.337 --> 00:05:42.476
all of the work that we've
been able to do together

00:05:42.476 --> 00:05:44.914
with governments, with
teachers, with students,

00:05:44.914 --> 00:05:47.111
it's no longer just a dream.

00:05:47.111 --> 00:05:48.525
It's really happening.

00:05:48.525 --> 00:05:51.396
And the momentum that we've
built together in 2016

00:05:51.396 --> 00:05:54.454
is continuing to accelerate into 2017,

00:05:54.454 --> 00:05:57.961
and I expect is going to
accelerate in 2018 and beyond

00:05:57.961 --> 00:06:00.899
so that, as we look
back in a decade or two,

00:06:00.899 --> 00:06:03.508
we'll say how could we
ever imagine a world

00:06:03.508 --> 00:06:06.717
where there wasn't a free,
world-class education

00:06:06.717 --> 00:06:08.467
for anyone, anywhere?
