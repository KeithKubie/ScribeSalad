00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.460
What I want to start thinking
about in this video is,

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.290
given that we do have a
monopoly on something,

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.380
and in this example,
in this video,

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.440
we're going to have a
monopoly on oranges.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.410
Given that we have a
monopoly on oranges

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.360
and a demand curve for
oranges in the market,

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.194
how do we maximize our profit?

00:00:18.194 --> 00:00:19.610
And to answer that
question, we're

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.193
going to think about
our total revenue

00:00:21.193 --> 00:00:23.007
for different quantities.

00:00:23.007 --> 00:00:24.840
And from that we'll get
the marginal revenue

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.980
for different quantities.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.500
And then we can compare that
to our marginal cost curve.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.291
And that should give
us a pretty good sense

00:00:30.291 --> 00:00:34.550
of what quantity we should
produce to optimize things.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.260
So let's just figure
out total revenue first.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.010
So obviously, if
we produce nothing,

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.930
if we produces 0 quantity,
we'll have nothing to sell.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.530
Total revenue is
price times quantity.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.990
Your price is 6 but
your quantity is 0.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:51.240
So your total revenue is going
to be 0 if you produce nothing.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.880
If you produce 1 unit--
and this over here

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.880
is actually 1,000
pounds per day.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.580
And we'll call a unit
1,000 pounds per day.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.597
If you produce 1 unit,
then your total revenue

00:01:00.597 --> 00:01:04.019
is 1 unit times $5 per pound.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.480
So it'll be $5 times, actually
1,000, so it'll be $5,000.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.260
And you can also view it as
the area right over here.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.200
You have the height is price
and the width is quantity.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.000
But we can plot that, 5 times 1.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.460
If you produce 1 unit,
you're going to get $5,000.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.550
So this right over here
is in thousands of dollars

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.885
and this right over here
is in thousands of pounds.

00:01:33.169 --> 00:01:35.460
Just to make sure that we're
consistent with this right

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.410
over here.

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:37.340
Let's keep going.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.200
So that was this point, or
when we produce 1,000 pounds,

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.165
we get $5,000.

00:01:43.165 --> 00:01:47.260
If we produce 2,000
pounds, now we're

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.790
talking about our price
is going to be $4.

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.840
Or if we could say
our price is $4

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.840
we can sell 2,000 pounds,
given this demand curve.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.340
And our total revenue
is going to be

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.900
the area of this
rectangle right over here.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.050
Height is price,
width is quantity.

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:03.960
4 times 2 is 8.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.640
So if I produce
2,000 pounds then

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.169
I will get a total
revenue of $8,000.

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:12.210
So this is 7 and 1/2,
8 is going to put

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.320
us something right about there.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.070
And then we can keep going.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.310
If I produce, or if the
price is $3 per pound,

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.650
I can sell 3,000 pounds.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.690
My total revenue is this
rectangle right over here,

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.630
$3 times 3 is $9,000.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.920
So if I produce
3,000 pounds, I can

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.260
get a total revenue of $9,000.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.990
So right about there.

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.680
And let's keep going.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.980
If I produce, or if the
price, is $2 per pound,

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.660
I can sell 4,000 pounds.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.830
My total revenue is $2
times 4, which is $8,000.

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.330
So if I produce
4,000 pounds I can

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.976
get a total revenue of $8,000.

00:02:55.976 --> 00:02:59.660
It should be even with that
one right over there, just

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:00.850
like that.

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:13.400
And then if the price is $1 per
pound I can sell 5,000 pounds.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.870
My total revenue is going
to be $1 times 5, or $5,000.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.880
So it's going to be
even with this here.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.560
So if I produce 5,000 units
I can get $5,000 of revenue.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.700
And if the price
is 0, the market

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.752
will demand 6,000 pounds
per day if it's free.

00:03:29.752 --> 00:03:31.960
But I'm not going to generate
any revenue because I'm

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.940
going to be giving
it away for free.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.700
So I will not be generating
any revenue in this situation.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.237
So our total revenue curve,
it looks like-- and if you've

00:03:40.237 --> 00:03:41.820
taken algebra you
would recognize this

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:48.270
as a downward facing
parabola-- our total revenue

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.380
looks like this.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.540
It's easier for me to draw
a curve with a dotted line.

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.450
Our total revenue looks
something like that.

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.410
And you can even
solve it algebraically

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.360
to show that it is this
downward facing parabola.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.120
The formula right over
here of the demand curve,

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.500
its y-intercept is 6.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.970
So if I wanted to write price
as a function of quantity

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:16.480
we have price is equal
to 6 minus quantity.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.980
Or if you wanted to write in
the traditional slope intercept

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.750
form, or mx plus b form-- and
if that doesn't make any sense

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.220
you might want to review some
of our algebra playlist--

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.640
you could write it as p is
equal to negative q plus 6.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.830
Obviously these are
the same exact thing.

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:36.010
You have a y-intercept of
six and you have a negative 1

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:37.230
slope.

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.900
If you increase quantity by
1, you decrease price by 1.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.630
Or another way to think about
it, if you decrease price by 1

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.820
you increase quantity by 1.

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.340
So that's why you have
a negative 1 slope.

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.570
So this is price is a
function of quantity.

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.080
What is total revenue?

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.870
Well, total revenue is equal
to price times quantity.

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.460
But we can write price as
a function of quantity.

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:01.410
We did it just now.

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:02.930
This is what it is.

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.990
So we can rewrite it, or we
could even write it like this,

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.510
we can rewrite the
price part as-- so this

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:14.280
is going to be equal to negative
q plus 6 times quantity.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.784
And this is equal
to total revenue.

00:05:19.784 --> 00:05:21.200
And then if you
multiply this out,

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.070
you get total
revenue is equal to q

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:30.010
times q is negative q
squared plus 6 plus 6q.

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:31.920
So you might recognize this.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.820
This is clearly a quadratic.

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.060
Since you have a negative out
front before the second degree

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.920
term right over here,
before the q squared,

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.120
it is a downward
opening parabola.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.300
So it makes complete sense.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.500
Now, I'm going to leave
you there in this video.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.000
Because I'm trying
to make an effort

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.017
not to make my videos too long.

00:05:50.017 --> 00:05:51.600
But in the next video
what we're going

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.540
to think about is, what
is the marginal revenue we

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.560
get for each of
these quantities?

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:03.610
And just as a review,
marginal revenue

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:08.820
is equal to change in
total revenue divided

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:10.770
by change in quantity.

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.220
Or another way to think about
it, the marginal revenue

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:17.000
at any one of these
quantities is the slope

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.607
of the line tangent
to that point.

00:06:18.607 --> 00:06:20.690
And you really have to do
a little bit of calculus

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.820
in order to actually calculate
slopes of tangent lines.

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.350
But we'll approximate it
with a little bit of algebra.

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:28.490
But what we essentially want
to do is figure out the slope.

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.031
So if we wanted to figure out
the marginal revenue when we're

00:06:31.031 --> 00:06:34.080
selling 1,000 pounds--
so exactly how much more

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:37.510
total revenue do we get if
we just barely increase,

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:40.420
if we just started selling
another millionth of a pound

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.477
of oranges-- what's
going to happen?

00:06:42.477 --> 00:06:44.060
And so what we do
is we're essentially

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.270
trying to figure out the
slope of the tangent line

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:49.356
at any point.

00:06:49.356 --> 00:06:50.230
And you can see that.

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:53.820
Because the change
in total revenue

00:06:53.820 --> 00:07:00.750
is this and change in
quantity is that there.

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:02.975
So we're trying to find
the instantaneous slope

00:07:02.975 --> 00:07:04.600
at that point, or
you could think of it

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.190
as the slope of
the tangent line.

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:10.840
And we'll continue doing
that in the next video.
