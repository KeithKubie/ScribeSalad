00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:08.154
Hello everyone. I'm Mike Salem and I'm

00:00:08.154 --> 00:00:10.889
the service lead for Udacity Robotics Nanodegree Program,

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.085
and I'm here with the assistant professor in robotics at the University of Bristol,

00:00:14.085 --> 00:00:18.620
Bristol robotics, and President and co-founder of robohubs Sabine Hauert.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:19.950
Sabine, how are you?

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:20.929
I'm great. How are you, Mike?

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:22.565
I'm doing well, thank you.

00:00:22.565 --> 00:00:24.119
I was wondering if we could talk a little bit about

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.039
the theory of swarm robotics and swarm intelligence.

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:30.960
Sabine, what is swarm intelligence?

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.174
So if you look at birds and ants and bees they can do these beautiful complex behavior.

00:00:35.174 --> 00:00:38.169
So for example, you've probably seen flocks in the sky,

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.660
you've probably seen ants go to your picnic table,

00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:46.559
and you might know that bees can make decisions about where they create their nests next,

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.215
and these are all swarm behaviors.

00:00:48.215 --> 00:00:51.345
And the way they work is that each agent,

00:00:51.344 --> 00:00:52.500
whether they're a bird,

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.835
or bee, or an ant,

00:00:53.835 --> 00:00:56.910
just looking at their local neighborhood

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:01.199
or their local environment and following a simple set of rules,

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.280
can give rise to these swarm behaviors which are emerging behaviors.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.489
So it's all about figuring out how the agents

00:01:08.489 --> 00:01:12.579
behave in a very simple manner to get these complex behaviors,

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:14.319
and that's swarm intelligence.

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:16.354
So that's really interesting. So we're saying that

00:01:16.355 --> 00:01:19.020
a biological being that's kind of primitive in

00:01:19.019 --> 00:01:21.179
nature is able to kind of be able

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.820
to carry out more complex tasks when they work together.

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:28.649
That's the thinking. It's more than a sum of their parts.

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:29.880
So by working together,

00:01:29.879 --> 00:01:32.739
swarms are able to achieve these complex behaviors.

00:01:32.739 --> 00:01:36.929
I know ants are a particular interest of a lot of researchers,

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.375
even dating back a couple of decades ago,

00:01:39.375 --> 00:01:42.930
where they were looking at the trails of ants and how ants

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.640
communicate along these trails to kind of find

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.599
food sources or to carry out different types of tasks.

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:50.399
Would you be able to speak a little bit more about some of

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.900
the behavior that we've seen in ants and how some

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.605
of these things potentially are modeled?

00:01:54.605 --> 00:01:58.320
Yeah, sure. It's really interesting to

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:02.069
think about how ants do things like creating these trails to food sources in nature.

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:05.069
So they're quite good at finding these food sources and

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:08.834
adapting their trails so that they can find the shortest trails to different sources.

00:02:08.835 --> 00:02:12.205
And different ant colonies have different types of trails,

00:02:12.205 --> 00:02:15.344
and the way they do that is the process called stigmergy,

00:02:15.344 --> 00:02:18.180
which means communication through the environments.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.520
And the general idea is that ants,

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.705
as they explore their environment, they leave the nest,

00:02:23.705 --> 00:02:28.410
they deposit chemicals called pheromones as they go,

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:31.794
and other ants can sense those pheromones and

00:02:31.794 --> 00:02:35.469
can choose to follow paths with highest pheromones, for example.

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:38.629
This pheromone evaporates over time as well,

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:42.030
and by following simple rules of depositing pheromone,

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.439
sensing pheromone, following those paths with pheromone leads to a probability,

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:48.305
and having pheromone evaporate,

00:02:48.305 --> 00:02:50.335
you get trails that emerge.

00:02:50.335 --> 00:02:52.140
And it's been quite interesting to use some of

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:55.829
these rules for the robotics and the computer science world.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.020
So for example, there's a thing called ant colony

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.915
optimization which takes inspiration from what the natural ants are doing,

00:03:02.914 --> 00:03:07.269
for example, route packets through a network.

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.933
In my case, I had been studying how we can use ants-like rules to

00:03:11.933 --> 00:03:17.300
deploy networks of flying robots to create communication systems outdoors,

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.545
and there again, we use principles where

00:03:19.544 --> 00:03:22.559
robots have to sense where pheromone levels were,

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.245
and other robots can follow those paths and over time,

00:03:25.245 --> 00:03:26.520
we could create trails,

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.840
for example, between rescuer's that needed to communicate through this network.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.420
So there's a number of rules that we've learned from

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:37.454
biologists and that we can use them in the engineering world.

00:03:37.455 --> 00:03:41.310
It's also interesting to check to biologists because obviously, it's not that simple.

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.557
Many different ant colonies,

00:03:42.557 --> 00:03:45.909
many different strategies emerge.

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:48.090
And I was chatting with Nigel Franks,

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.770
who is a big researcher on the outside in terms of the biology,

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.918
and so we were talking about these pheromones,

00:03:54.918 --> 00:03:56.625
and how they create these trails.

00:03:56.625 --> 00:03:59.370
And actually, if you take smaller colonies,

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.900
it doesn't make sense for them to communicate using chemicals.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.189
And so they were able to come up with another strategy with ants,

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:08.514
is once they've figured out where the food sources are,

00:04:08.514 --> 00:04:12.639
they actually go back to their nests and carry the ants there.

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:15.899
So obviously, the biological world is much more complex but that just leads to

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.345
so many more ideas that we can then use in the realm of engineering.

00:04:20.345 --> 00:04:24.180
That's a really interesting way of doing the communication,

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.900
by picking up an ant and actually bringing them back.

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:29.129
Is it because the ant itself has omitted some sort of

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:33.779
trail or a scent that it knows or is it just because of memory placement

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:38.079
that it knows to kind of carry back and forth to that same food source?

00:04:38.079 --> 00:04:40.800
Yeah, it's unclear. I mean if you have many, many ants,

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.360
then you somewhat have critical mass,

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.930
where you can start communicating through

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.689
the environments by depositing and sensing these pheromones.

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:49.134
It could be via the smaller colony,

00:04:49.134 --> 00:04:50.300
you don't have critical mass,

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.350
and so your pheromones would just evaporate all the time,

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.129
so your ants will get lost.

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:57.899
So that means to a certain extent you can have fewer ants,

00:04:57.899 --> 00:05:01.495
maybe these ants need to be smarter individually and

00:05:01.495 --> 00:05:03.230
that they might need some way to navigate

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:06.050
their environment without these pheromones.

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.855
And then it will make sense to carry the other ants there as well

00:05:09.855 --> 00:05:11.379
because we have that information

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:13.735
so you want to show another ant how to do that.

00:05:13.735 --> 00:05:15.660
But obviously, its much, much more fun fact.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.830
So why they do it it's not entirely clear to me.

00:05:18.829 --> 00:05:20.479
It's a really interesting problem.

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.090
I mean, if you think about a smaller colony being able to do

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:26.144
something you would need a lot more autonomy between each individual,

00:05:26.144 --> 00:05:28.104
and a lot more capability,

00:05:28.105 --> 00:05:29.210
then as your colony grows,

00:05:29.209 --> 00:05:32.959
you can actually delegate a lot of that work and then be able

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:38.459
to achieve the same task with a much lower level of intelligence.

00:05:38.459 --> 00:05:41.129
Yeah, that's something I'm fascinated by right now.

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:44.624
So in our lab there are small swarms.

00:05:44.624 --> 00:05:45.385
So for example,

00:05:45.384 --> 00:05:48.110
the swarm I did in my PhD with these 10 flying robots,

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:49.365
and there's large swarms,

00:05:49.365 --> 00:05:52.420
we have a thousand robots in our lab as well.

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:56.080
And the complexity of the individual robots,

00:05:56.079 --> 00:05:59.750
so what they can do is very different depending on how many you have,

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:00.651
because if you want to make a thousand,

00:06:00.651 --> 00:06:04.875
they need to be cheap and they end up being noisy,

00:06:04.875 --> 00:06:07.540
and so they end up being a little bit less reliable,

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.423
so you have more of them.

00:06:09.423 --> 00:06:12.774
And I love playing around with what algorithms work,

00:06:12.774 --> 00:06:14.209
when you reach huge numbers

00:06:14.209 --> 00:06:16.759
given that your individuals are a little bit simpler

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:20.009
or what algorithms work when you have fewer robots,

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:22.789
knowing that each individual is maybe a little bit

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:25.580
smarter but you don't have those mass numbers,

00:06:25.579 --> 00:06:29.284
and I really think that the strategies that you use are completely different.

00:06:29.285 --> 00:06:33.530
So it's fun to think about how you swarm across scales.

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:36.914
And actually, you need to maybe have some good ideas.

00:06:36.915 --> 00:06:41.145
Yeah. Talking about the idea of swarming in terms of robots,

00:06:41.144 --> 00:06:46.039
what kind of sensors would you use to kind of be able to dictate that kind of behavior?

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.800
It really depends what you're trying to achieve.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.555
So the key is you want to have information about your local environment.

00:06:53.555 --> 00:06:57.500
So your local environment could be robots in your neighborhood,

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:02.865
in which case, usually want some form of communication, and that could be

00:07:02.865 --> 00:07:05.600
That could be Wi-Fi, you know, there's a number of ways you

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.825
could do virtual communication.

00:07:07.824 --> 00:07:10.939
Or, you might want to be able to sense your environment.

00:07:10.939 --> 00:07:13.269
So, whatever sensor allows you to sense environments.

00:07:13.269 --> 00:07:16.472
But it really depends on the types of applications that you are looking on.

00:07:16.473 --> 00:07:18.694
In your environment and most of these cases is

00:07:18.694 --> 00:07:21.350
the environment kind of unstructured in the sense that you don't

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:22.850
really know where you are in

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:26.570
the environment from an environment or an overview perspective.

00:07:26.569 --> 00:07:30.194
So, there's no cameras or anything that are kind of watching this behavior.

00:07:30.194 --> 00:07:32.069
It's more of the behavior is more localized.

00:07:32.069 --> 00:07:36.430
The agent itself kind of moving around or is there both types of situations?

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:39.694
Well, in the world of swarming,

00:07:39.694 --> 00:07:42.485
the whole point of doing swarm behaviors is that there is

00:07:42.485 --> 00:07:47.040
no leader or godly figure that has an overall view of what's happening.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:51.720
And the reason that's an advantage is that because there is no leader,

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.420
these systems can scale to

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:57.060
much larger numbers and only yield local information and simple rules.

00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:00.634
So, you could theoretically achieve huge numbers of

00:08:00.634 --> 00:08:04.819
agents and they're more robust because there's no single point of failure.

00:08:04.819 --> 00:08:08.060
So, those are the reasons we do swarming is the ability to be

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:11.766
robust and scalable and to have these emerging properties.

00:08:11.766 --> 00:08:14.025
In reality, in the lab, in our environments,

00:08:14.024 --> 00:08:16.279
we obviously monitor what these swarms are doing so that

00:08:16.279 --> 00:08:18.784
we can have a better understanding.

00:08:18.785 --> 00:08:22.451
Really the puzzle in swarm engineering

00:08:22.451 --> 00:08:26.345
is that typically you know what swarm behavior you want to achieve.

00:08:26.345 --> 00:08:29.210
You might want your robots to flock or make decisions or

00:08:29.209 --> 00:08:32.735
create trails or do something clever in an application.

00:08:32.735 --> 00:08:37.730
But typically you don't know exactly how to design those individual behaviors.

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:40.430
It's very non-obvious to go between

00:08:40.429 --> 00:08:45.324
the individual behaviors to what the swarm does as a whole.

00:08:45.325 --> 00:08:47.540
And so, we need these experimental setups where you

00:08:47.539 --> 00:08:50.149
do have an environment where you can see what the swarm is doing so that we

00:08:50.149 --> 00:08:53.299
can troubleshoot that and try lots of different individual behaviors and

00:08:53.299 --> 00:08:57.019
see if they're doing the right swarm behavior so that we can engineer these.

00:08:57.019 --> 00:09:00.470
So this whole process of swarm engineering in the lab at

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:05.565
least just required us to have this whole infrastructure set up.

00:09:05.565 --> 00:09:09.350
So, in a practical standpoint though you wouldn't want to have this overview.

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:11.180
You want to be able to kind of allow these robots to

00:09:11.179 --> 00:09:14.239
autonomously self-organize and kind of be

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:19.663
able to achieve a task without having an overview of that system at all.

00:09:19.663 --> 00:09:21.470
Is that the goal I think eventually here?

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:25.610
So, there's really two ways to think about the swarm deployments.

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:26.855
One is that, in general,

00:09:26.855 --> 00:09:30.200
you would want to find a good way for humans to interact with

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:34.550
swarms so that they do have oversight over what these robots are doing.

00:09:34.549 --> 00:09:36.554
And that's actually a whole area of research.

00:09:36.554 --> 00:09:39.319
How are we going to interact with swarms so that

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:42.735
we get feedback about what the emerging behavior is?

00:09:42.735 --> 00:09:44.633
Is it that you can see the whole swarm

00:09:44.633 --> 00:09:48.405
and so you can just see what they're doing and you're happy with that?

00:09:48.404 --> 00:09:50.240
Is it that information about what they're

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.879
doing somehow is shared amongst the swarms so you

00:09:52.879 --> 00:09:57.835
could pick up a robot and that robot would tell you with the swarm as a whole is doing?

00:09:57.835 --> 00:10:00.355
So, that's a question we're trying to figure out.

00:10:00.355 --> 00:10:02.389
The other way to approach this is,

00:10:02.389 --> 00:10:05.659
say okay, well, swarms have emergent properties.

00:10:05.659 --> 00:10:10.149
And so they're going through local interactions and huge numbers achieve ideally

00:10:10.149 --> 00:10:15.269
the behavior you want because you've engineered that swarm to behave in the way you want.

00:10:15.269 --> 00:10:18.699
But we need to make sure that that system

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:25.090
has a graceful degradation if it's not performing what it was supposed to do.

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:27.665
So, for example are these robots really minimal?

00:10:27.664 --> 00:10:29.149
Are they small, are they safe,

00:10:29.149 --> 00:10:32.004
are they potentially biodegradable or disposable?

00:10:32.004 --> 00:10:34.990
So that if the swarm was not exactly performing what you

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:37.868
wanted to do in non-safety critical missions,

00:10:37.868 --> 00:10:39.250
then that's perfectly fine.

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:41.289
It was engineered to behave in that way.

00:10:41.289 --> 00:10:43.539
So, there's really two fronts. One is how can we

00:10:43.539 --> 00:10:46.360
interact with swarms that we understand what they're doing?

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:48.220
And the other is how can we design the swarm in

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:50.800
such a way that actually they were built to just go out

00:10:50.799 --> 00:10:55.579
and do what they were meant to do and maybe degrade or bio, be disposed?

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:57.345
And that would be fine as well.

00:10:57.345 --> 00:11:00.445
So, it depends what they're meant to be doing.

00:11:00.445 --> 00:11:02.977
I see. It's a really kind of an interesting problem.

00:11:02.976 --> 00:11:04.689
I think when we start talking about the idea of

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:08.125
the self-organization and kind of giving really basic rules,

00:11:08.125 --> 00:11:11.350
obviously there's some sort of time lapse that has to occur before

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:14.725
you could actually ramp up and actually have that swarm behavior.

00:11:14.725 --> 00:11:17.920
I would imagine that you would, if I looked at it from a particle standpoint, basically,

00:11:17.919 --> 00:11:20.889
what you do is you have a bunch of particles that are kind of randomly moving

00:11:20.889 --> 00:11:24.324
all over the place in some sort of unstructured motion.

00:11:24.325 --> 00:11:26.875
And over time, these particles start to kind of

00:11:26.875 --> 00:11:30.460
self-organize and start achieving a goal and moving in unison.

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:36.550
How long does it take during robot simulations to kind of see that behavior emerge?

00:11:36.549 --> 00:11:38.609
It really depends.

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:39.970
So, there's two problems.

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:42.144
One is, once you know the rules,

00:11:42.144 --> 00:11:44.850
how long does it take for any one simulation

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:47.774
of these rules to give rise to a desired swarm behavior?

00:11:47.774 --> 00:11:52.954
And that all depends on the swarm behavior you're trying to achieve.

00:11:52.955 --> 00:11:54.325
You're right it's not immediate.

00:11:54.325 --> 00:11:58.492
These things because they're the result of local interactions between lots of agents,

00:11:58.491 --> 00:12:04.974
they take time to bubble up for you to actually see what emergent behavior is arising.

00:12:04.975 --> 00:12:08.590
And there's another time question which is more relevant which is,

00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:12.670
how do we discover the right swarm behavior for a given application?

00:12:12.669 --> 00:12:13.750
And that actually takes much,

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:15.899
much longer before we get it right.

00:12:15.899 --> 00:12:20.039
And that's what the bulk of my research at least is in.

00:12:20.039 --> 00:12:23.259
So the way I solve this puzzle between what's

00:12:23.259 --> 00:12:26.814
the right rules for a desired swarm behavior

00:12:26.815 --> 00:12:29.710
is quite looking at what biologists

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:33.715
do and that obviously takes them years of research to come up with rules.

00:12:33.715 --> 00:12:36.070
And then when they have them we can test them and see

00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:39.110
what happens on our artificial systems.

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:42.519
The other strategy is trial and error and that's typically lots and lots of

00:12:42.519 --> 00:12:46.484
tests and rules that we know about and seen as they work.

00:12:46.484 --> 00:12:49.605
Now, we can kind of ramp that up using crowdsourcing.

00:12:49.605 --> 00:12:54.620
So, having lots of people help us design rules for robots forms.

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:56.500
And the other, the final way,

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:58.480
which I really like is using machine learning.

00:12:58.480 --> 00:12:59.620
So, we did a lot of

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:04.235
artificial evolution that's automatically come up with swarm behaviors.

00:13:04.235 --> 00:13:07.509
And so, the reason it takes time for us to discover

00:13:07.509 --> 00:13:11.904
these rules using machine learning is typically we'll,

00:13:11.904 --> 00:13:13.589
for example with artificial evolution,

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:18.365
you'll start with a random swarm program and then you'll test it on the robot.

00:13:18.365 --> 00:13:21.159
And you're right it takes time for the behavior to

00:13:21.159 --> 00:13:24.384
emerge so every simulation takes a little bit of time.

00:13:24.384 --> 00:13:26.235
And then based on what we've learned,

00:13:26.235 --> 00:13:29.110
we're going to change the program a little bit and so you keep changing

00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:33.690
the program until you find the rules that give you the right swarm behavior.

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:38.530
And to actually reach that point takes time both in terms of machine learning,

00:13:38.529 --> 00:13:42.339
but also in terms of running each one of these simulations.

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:50.690
That being said, even though these behaviors take time to emerge,

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:55.105
ideally there is a time gain by using many robots.

00:13:55.105 --> 00:13:58.180
So, if you think of a farm fields,

00:13:58.179 --> 00:14:00.684
kilometer by kilometer farm fields,

00:14:00.684 --> 00:14:04.549
there's around 100 million seeds within that farm fields.

00:14:04.549 --> 00:14:08.529
And the way we would typically plant those seeds using a robot might be

00:14:08.529 --> 00:14:10.389
to have a tractor that zigzags through

00:14:10.389 --> 00:14:12.800
that farm fields and takes a certain amount of time.

00:14:12.801 --> 00:14:14.665
But maybe a swarm of i don't know

00:14:14.664 --> 00:14:22.174
biodegradable robots seeds could deploy much quicker because there's many more of them.

00:14:22.174 --> 00:14:26.529
So, the time it takes the behavior to emerge it's not immediate but

00:14:26.529 --> 00:14:31.659
actually overall it might compare better to a single robot that needs to do everything.

00:14:31.659 --> 00:14:33.230
Right.

00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:35.470
And so as the area gets larger and larger for you to

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:37.960
accomplish a task having swarm robots is

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:40.150
definitely more advantageous because you would be able to

00:14:40.149 --> 00:14:43.034
cover as many things as quickly as possible.

00:14:43.034 --> 00:14:46.480
So, if speed is really your objective in this case,

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.220
you could send out a bunch of robots

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:51.129
to kind of plant seeds in a larger field than it would

00:14:51.129 --> 00:14:53.120
for the amount of time it would take for a tractor to kind of

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:56.544
zigzag back and forth and drop each one by one.

00:14:56.544 --> 00:15:00.604
Yeah, I think area coverage is definitely an area where swarms make sense.

00:15:00.605 --> 00:15:04.940
So, where you have huge areas whether it's for creating communication networks or

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:09.424
doing something within these environments or sensing or exploration,

00:15:09.423 --> 00:15:12.409
those are all things that frankly we can do very

00:15:12.409 --> 00:15:15.844
well with one or two robots and where we wouldn't need many robots.

00:15:15.845 --> 00:15:17.701
And if we could make many of these robots

00:15:17.701 --> 00:15:20.139
work together in a more intelligent way,

00:15:20.139 --> 00:15:21.688
ideally there's a time gain there.

00:15:21.688 --> 00:15:25.129
I know you mentioned just a few minutes

00:15:25.129 --> 00:15:28.009
back about the idea of working with biologists

00:15:28.009 --> 00:15:31.409
to kind of study the models of actual biological beings,

00:15:31.409 --> 00:15:34.519
and using that to kind of emulate what you're doing in your robot.

00:15:34.519 --> 00:15:36.710
How important do you feel that iterative cycle is

00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:39.350
of kind of viewing what a biologist has done,

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:42.110
trying to implement it in a robotic setting and kind of

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:45.350
taking that information back and providing that back to a biologist,

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:48.620
does that help both of you kind of refine your models or is it more

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:52.634
of a one way flow from a biologist to a roboticist?

00:15:52.634 --> 00:15:55.284
Yeah, it's a really neat feedback loop.

00:15:55.284 --> 00:16:02.034
So, for example, biologists have been studying how to evolve cooperation.

00:16:02.034 --> 00:16:08.584
So, what is it in natural evolution that gives rise to systems that cooperate?

00:16:08.585 --> 00:16:11.210
And actually the lessons that we learned from

00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:14.400
that allowed us to evolve robots that cooperate.

00:16:14.399 --> 00:16:16.730
And by doing it on the artificial systems,

00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:21.409
we could also have the biologists test hypotheses because we could evolve things.

00:16:21.409 --> 00:16:25.319
Artificially it was much quicker than evolving them in the biological world.

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:30.504
And so we could help them come up with interesting ideas of what was happening in nature.

00:16:30.504 --> 00:16:34.370
And that's definitely the case with the number of swarm behaviors that we're looking at.

00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:38.480
Just because with simple rules sometimes we achieve very cool behaviors.

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.455
Even if they have nothing to do with biology,

00:16:40.455 --> 00:16:43.160
sometimes we can say, "Actually I wonder if the ants do that.

00:16:43.159 --> 00:16:44.954
Or, "I wonder if the bees do that."

00:16:44.955 --> 00:16:47.810
And that gives them a hypothesis to work from.

00:16:47.809 --> 00:16:50.309
So, I really like this feedback loop.

00:16:50.309 --> 00:16:54.349
And right now we're working as well with synthetic biologists to engineer,

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:58.305
for example, bacteria to do interesting things.

00:16:58.304 --> 00:17:00.139
And so it's a nice crossover between

00:17:00.139 --> 00:17:03.321
how we engineer robots and how you'd engineer bacteria,

00:17:03.321 --> 00:17:06.289
and how we can make systems with swarm.

00:17:06.289 --> 00:17:08.599
So, it's really interesting to kind of hear about bacteria being

00:17:08.599 --> 00:17:10.994
modeled inside of robotics.

00:17:10.994 --> 00:17:12.909
Is there any other applications for something like, I don't know,

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:15.800
let's say like medicine where using some sort of particles to

00:17:15.799 --> 00:17:19.409
kind of give treatments or doses to a patient?

00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:23.685
Yes. After my PhD designing swarms of flying robots,

00:17:23.684 --> 00:17:26.200
I realized that there were only 10 in the air.

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:27.759
It was exciting, but it was 10 robots.

00:17:27.759 --> 00:17:31.000
And then in my mind, swarms needed to work in much larger numbers,

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.815
in the hundreds and the thousands.

00:17:32.815 --> 00:17:36.289
And so, I got really excited about the area of nanomedicine,

00:17:36.289 --> 00:17:41.694
and I spent three years at the lab at MIT that makes nanoparticles for cancer treatments.

00:17:41.694 --> 00:17:46.814
And what fascinates me is these nanoparticles come in the 10 to the power 13.

00:17:46.815 --> 00:17:49.460
So that was the huge number that I was looking

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:53.019
for in terms of using those particles for treatments.

00:17:53.019 --> 00:17:56.809
And those particles that they were designing

00:17:56.809 --> 00:17:59.700
to meet the test level also had a number of interesting features.

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:01.970
So, you could change the size of the particle,

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:03.674
and that changed how they move.

00:18:03.674 --> 00:18:06.349
You could decorate particles with molecules that would

00:18:06.349 --> 00:18:09.784
allow them to stick to cancer cells or self-assemble.

00:18:09.785 --> 00:18:15.154
You could load these particles with drugs that you could release in a controlled fashion.

00:18:15.154 --> 00:18:18.527
And you could make them with different materials that you could activate.

00:18:18.527 --> 00:18:21.590
For example, using magnetic fields or using lights.

00:18:21.589 --> 00:18:24.919
So actually, depending on how you design these particles,

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:27.725
you could change how they move,

00:18:27.724 --> 00:18:31.014
how they interact with other particles,

00:18:31.015 --> 00:18:33.290
what they release in their environments.

00:18:33.289 --> 00:18:37.325
And those were a lot of the building blocks that we would use for swarm robotics.

00:18:37.325 --> 00:18:39.920
I'm really keen on understanding

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:43.759
how things in the medical world, whether they're nanoparticles,

00:18:43.759 --> 00:18:47.180
whether they're bacteria, which naturally work in huge numbers,

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:52.580
how we can engineer their behavior as a collective just by tweaking the individuals.

00:18:52.579 --> 00:18:56.629
And I think that's a pretty untapped territory actually,

00:18:56.630 --> 00:19:00.440
where swarm engineering could have a pretty big impact.

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:03.200
How does your train of thought change when you're having to deal with

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:08.115
something from such a smaller scale to a much larger scale?

00:19:08.115 --> 00:19:10.859
It doesn't.

00:19:10.859 --> 00:19:14.809
My puzzle is,

00:19:14.809 --> 00:19:18.559
how do you go from an individual behavior to a desired swarm behavior?

00:19:18.559 --> 00:19:20.554
So this process of swarm engineering,

00:19:20.555 --> 00:19:22.310
whether it's using bio inspiration,

00:19:22.309 --> 00:19:23.559
whether it's using machine learning,

00:19:23.559 --> 00:19:24.984
whether it's using trial and error,

00:19:24.984 --> 00:19:27.854
and crowdsourcing is the same across scales.

00:19:27.855 --> 00:19:29.690
What I do change is my agents.

00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:31.870
So they could be virtual agents, they could be robots,

00:19:31.869 --> 00:19:34.589
they could be bacteria, they could be nanoparticles.

00:19:34.589 --> 00:19:36.509
And I think the key thing there,

00:19:36.509 --> 00:19:38.644
what did change in my thought process,

00:19:38.644 --> 00:19:41.000
is that in each one of the situations,

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.539
I actually need to get my hands dirty.

00:19:43.539 --> 00:19:45.004
So with the flying robots,

00:19:45.005 --> 00:19:48.125
I needed to build with my colleagues

00:19:48.125 --> 00:19:51.920
the robots and throw them in the air and see what they were doing with the nanoparticles.

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:54.985
We needed to make nanoparticles and see them under the microscope.

00:19:54.984 --> 00:19:57.709
But once you get the grasp of what agents do,

00:19:57.710 --> 00:20:01.370
and how they interact with their neighbors and with their environments,

00:20:01.369 --> 00:20:03.559
that gives you the building blocks that you need

00:20:03.559 --> 00:20:06.575
to go back to your swarm engineering approach.

00:20:06.575 --> 00:20:13.485
And so, it's really fun for me to see how similar things are across scales.

00:20:13.484 --> 00:20:15.769
For example, in our nanoparticle simulator,

00:20:15.769 --> 00:20:19.970
we've had to simplify a lot of the things that our particles can do.

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:23.285
They can't compute at the same level as the robots.

00:20:23.285 --> 00:20:27.894
They can go left and right just like my robots can and much, much simpler.

00:20:27.894 --> 00:20:30.109
And by simplifying what my agents can do,

00:20:30.109 --> 00:20:35.004
we've come up with really interesting behaviors that still are a bit swarmy.

00:20:35.005 --> 00:20:37.115
So they can still create, in simulation,

00:20:37.115 --> 00:20:41.000
trails a little bit like ants can create trails to your picnic table.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.194
There's some basic decision making algorithm.

00:20:43.194 --> 00:20:45.470
There's some really neat self-assembly and disassembly,

00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:48.055
and how you can use that to change how they move.

00:20:48.055 --> 00:20:50.914
And because we've done that in the nanoworld,

00:20:50.914 --> 00:20:54.139
in simulation, we've been thinking about where actually,

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:55.610
if we were to make a 1,000,

00:20:55.609 --> 00:20:59.000
10,000 robots that are centimeters-sized,

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.410
can we use those very,

00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:04.154
very simple principles that are simpler than the ones that we used to use for robots?

00:21:04.154 --> 00:21:06.865
And does that help the scale to those large numbers?

00:21:06.865 --> 00:21:09.019
So we have demos with the robots then,

00:21:09.019 --> 00:21:13.079
following rules to create trails and make those ant like trails,

00:21:13.079 --> 00:21:16.679
but much, much simpler than what we used to do.

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:18.140
And so I think we're going to find that there are

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:21.630
principles that do work across those scales,

00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:25.955
and the mechanism to discover these principles are the same.

00:21:25.954 --> 00:21:27.944
What's different is how you get your hands dirty and

00:21:27.944 --> 00:21:31.129
understanding what each one of the systems does.

00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:33.650
I'm also quite excited by the biomedical side.

00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:36.019
I think it's somewhat close to the application.

00:21:36.019 --> 00:21:40.389
So, with our nanoparticle work we talk with people in the medical fields,

00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:43.255
with clinicians, with bioengineers.

00:21:43.255 --> 00:21:46.595
They have really basic questions such as,

00:21:46.595 --> 00:21:55.170
what particle makes my treatment distribute correctly over a brain tumor?

00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:58.009
And the way you answer that question is to figure out

00:21:58.009 --> 00:22:01.000
what the right individual nanoparticle design is.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.119
Is it a bigger particle?

00:22:02.119 --> 00:22:03.444
Is a particle that charge?

00:22:03.444 --> 00:22:05.970
Is it a particle that sticks to the cancer cells?

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:07.059
And those are things that actually,

00:22:07.059 --> 00:22:11.004
if we find the answers now using swarm engineering approaches,

00:22:11.005 --> 00:22:14.210
those could have an impact nearer term.

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:16.670
Just in terms of understanding what the collective of those terms

00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:20.384
the power of 13 particles do.

00:22:20.384 --> 00:22:23.029
I'm quite excited by the application in

00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:24.889
the biomedical field because they need answers

00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:28.405
about how all these systems work together already.

00:22:28.404 --> 00:22:35.960
So having the benefit of using swarms to deploy medicine for tumor or cancer cells,

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:38.704
what are other applications do you see for

00:22:38.704 --> 00:22:43.970
these nanoparticles in the swarm environment to distribute,

00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:48.039
help or aid in the medical profession?

00:22:48.039 --> 00:22:51.649
Yes. So the cancer is the one I've focused on just because I need to learn

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:55.465
the whole area of cancer before I could really dive in.

00:22:55.464 --> 00:22:58.399
In general, many biological

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:02.269
systems that are relevant for health involve many actors working together,

00:23:02.269 --> 00:23:03.980
whether you look at the immune system,

00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:05.630
or you look at the microbiome.

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:08.600
And if we can understand, for example,

00:23:08.599 --> 00:23:12.589
how a biofilm forms in the area of anti-microbial resistance.

00:23:12.589 --> 00:23:14.119
Well, if you understand how it forms,

00:23:14.119 --> 00:23:15.239
maybe you could disrupt it,

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:18.000
and maybe you can control and engineer it.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.684
So I think there's a large number of

00:23:19.684 --> 00:23:23.869
biomedical challenges which involves many things working together,

00:23:23.869 --> 00:23:27.234
where we need a better understanding and we need a better way to control.

00:23:27.234 --> 00:23:29.384
And the control is really the new thing.

00:23:29.384 --> 00:23:32.109
I think there's many people trying to understand these systems,

00:23:32.109 --> 00:23:36.859
but it's fun to think about how you'd engineer and control them if you could.

00:23:36.859 --> 00:23:40.764
And I'm hoping that some of the techniques that we're using could be applicable there.

00:23:40.765 --> 00:23:46.509
But we always need expertise in those different areas to really make an impact.

00:23:46.509 --> 00:23:51.015
How cross-disciplinary do you feel swarm engineering and swarm robotics is?

00:23:51.015 --> 00:23:55.009
Do you feel that it really requires a large knowledge of biology,

00:23:55.009 --> 00:23:56.690
and engineering, and chemistry?

00:23:56.690 --> 00:24:03.570
Or is there some certain scales that you would focus more heavily on?

00:24:03.569 --> 00:24:06.889
It's really cross-disciplinary, but I think it's

00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:10.235
up to everyone to figure out what application area you want to work in,

00:24:10.234 --> 00:24:11.990
and then go ahead and learn it.

00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:14.720
So if you look at my team,

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:19.490
my students come from biomedical engineering, from physics,

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:22.220
from aerospace, from robotics,

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:24.650
from electrical engineering, computer science.

00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:27.660
They come from a variety of backgrounds.

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:30.110
And the reason they come from

00:24:30.109 --> 00:24:34.039
all those backgrounds is not because they're working specifically in their area,

00:24:34.039 --> 00:24:37.220
but just because I like to have lots of people from different areas

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:40.870
to feed into this process of engineering swarms.

00:24:40.869 --> 00:24:43.699
So for those who are working with bacteria, for example, well yes,

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:46.430
they need to spend time learning how you engineer bacteria,

00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:48.529
and how they work, and how you can see them at those scales,

00:24:48.529 --> 00:24:49.960
and how you can model them.

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:53.355
And those working on with robots are more focused on robots.

00:24:53.355 --> 00:24:55.759
You don't necessarily need to know the whole spectrum,

00:24:55.759 --> 00:25:00.105
but you can come into this field from a variety of backgrounds.

00:25:00.105 --> 00:25:02.224
Have you seen a lot of success implementing

00:25:02.224 --> 00:25:06.034
a single algorithm across multiple different disciplines,

00:25:06.035 --> 00:25:10.055
in terms of objectives that you're trying to reach?

00:25:10.055 --> 00:25:12.640
There's many basic principles,

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:14.660
sort of building blocks of swarming,

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:19.090
that you see over and over again.

00:25:19.089 --> 00:25:22.990
So if you look at [inaudible] and if you look at what ants are doing,

00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:24.190
if you look at what bees are doing,

00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:28.606
at least in terms of how we use them in swarm intelligence.

00:25:28.606 --> 00:25:32.000
Typically, you're exchanging information with your neighbors.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.160
You're either attracted to them or you're repulsed from them.

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:37.478
They're depositing something in the environment,

00:25:37.478 --> 00:25:42.495
and that's something in the environment is either attractive or repulsive.

00:25:42.494 --> 00:25:46.219
You're exchanging information with your neighbors and you're trying to sample what

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:48.063
your neighborhood is saying and based on that you

00:25:48.063 --> 00:25:50.990
change your state or you change your decision.

00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:55.325
So, there's a number of building blocks that do pop up

00:25:55.325 --> 00:25:57.559
as you try to engineer swarm behaviors and they're

00:25:57.559 --> 00:26:00.659
used across a number of swarm behaviors.

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:04.480
And so, sometimes it sounds like it should be simple to engineer swarms.

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:05.805
Because once you see the rules you're like,

00:26:05.805 --> 00:26:07.035
"Well, yeah, that's obvious.

00:26:07.035 --> 00:26:09.600
That's how you would create a trail to your picnic table."

00:26:09.599 --> 00:26:11.899
But actually just having the building blocks,

00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:16.115
doesn't actually tell you how to engineer these swarm behaviors.

00:26:16.115 --> 00:26:20.714
So, there are basic principles that are used over and over again.

00:26:20.714 --> 00:26:23.569
But actually you still need to really tune them in and re-engineer

00:26:23.569 --> 00:26:26.953
the swarm behavior when you think of a new application.

00:26:26.953 --> 00:26:30.829
I see. Outside of the area of nanomedicine,

00:26:30.829 --> 00:26:32.899
is there any other areas for

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:35.360
swarm robotics that you see that would be particularly interesting?

00:26:35.359 --> 00:26:38.448
On the larger scale,

00:26:38.449 --> 00:26:43.085
I'm quite excited about what we could be doing in swarm robotics.

00:26:43.085 --> 00:26:49.164
So, we're already seeing smaller robots swarms being used.

00:26:49.164 --> 00:26:50.674
So if you look at aerial robots,

00:26:50.674 --> 00:26:55.609
there are good examples of how you could have multiple robots work together.

00:26:55.609 --> 00:26:56.299
So for example,

00:26:56.299 --> 00:26:57.649
if you look at the entertainment side,

00:26:57.650 --> 00:27:02.150
you might have seen at the Super Bowl all these really neat quadrotors

00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:04.215
that were flying above Lady Gaga.

00:27:04.214 --> 00:27:09.079
That's one example where we're starting to see many robots that work together.

00:27:09.079 --> 00:27:14.173
I'd say in terms of applications there's been a big push towards multi-robot systems.

00:27:14.173 --> 00:27:18.884
So not necessarily swarms because it's not all emergent and self-organized,

00:27:18.884 --> 00:27:23.769
but multi-robot systems where you need multiple robots for a specific application.

00:27:23.769 --> 00:27:24.539
So for example,

00:27:24.539 --> 00:27:28.339
that could be flying robots and ground robots and underwater robots

00:27:28.339 --> 00:27:30.684
that are working together in a rescue mission.

00:27:30.684 --> 00:27:34.444
Or it could be robots like those that you find in the Amazon warehouses.

00:27:34.444 --> 00:27:36.875
So if you look at Amazon robots,

00:27:36.875 --> 00:27:39.394
those typically work in the thousands plus

00:27:39.394 --> 00:27:43.305
within a warehouse environment but it's much more controlled.

00:27:43.305 --> 00:27:45.174
And typically, there is a central system,

00:27:45.174 --> 00:27:51.014
a godly figure that tells every robot what to do and how to behave.

00:27:51.015 --> 00:27:53.720
So, those have been much more successful at going

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:56.839
towards real world applications right now.

00:27:56.839 --> 00:27:58.339
And I think it makes sense because we finally

00:27:58.339 --> 00:28:00.859
have individual robots that are rolling outside of

00:28:00.859 --> 00:28:05.740
the lab and we're trying to figure out how to get more than one work together.

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:10.805
In terms of the real swarm robots,

00:28:10.805 --> 00:28:14.029
up until now we've been very lab-based.

00:28:14.029 --> 00:28:18.019
And what's exciting on that front is that we can finally do

00:28:18.019 --> 00:28:21.859
experiments in the lab that involve a thousand plus robots.

00:28:21.859 --> 00:28:25.699
And that's thanks to Radhika Nagpal's system of Kilobot with

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:30.840
Michael Rubenstein and that allows us to do experiments with a 1,000 robots.

00:28:30.839 --> 00:28:34.369
And, we're just starting to see what algorithms work with

00:28:34.369 --> 00:28:38.174
those numbers and how we could use those in outer applications.

00:28:38.174 --> 00:28:40.519
But my hope now in something that we're focusing on,

00:28:40.519 --> 00:28:42.589
is how do you take those robots that work in

00:28:42.589 --> 00:28:45.480
the thousands and make an outdoor version of them?

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:48.769
Because the applications there are things like the planting seeds

00:28:48.769 --> 00:28:51.173
I mentioned before but also environmental monitoring.

00:28:51.173 --> 00:28:54.329
Could you quickly deploy these robots over an area and they

00:28:54.329 --> 00:28:56.809
sense something interesting in that environment

00:28:56.809 --> 00:28:58.519
and bring that information back to you?

00:28:58.519 --> 00:29:02.805
Could you use them anything where you need large areas?

00:29:02.805 --> 00:29:04.745
Which we currently can't do very well.

00:29:04.744 --> 00:29:08.314
And those are places where I want to see robots swarms being used.

00:29:08.315 --> 00:29:10.430
One of the things that I think about generally when I start thinking

00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:13.680
about swarm robotics and some of the applications is,

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:16.080
I tend to think of them more from the monitoring side of

00:29:16.079 --> 00:29:18.720
things because I tend to think of them as very kind of

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:21.029
primitive and being able to kind of more just collect

00:29:21.029 --> 00:29:24.504
information than it is really to act upon that information.

00:29:24.505 --> 00:29:28.350
Do you feel that the first real major deployment of swarms in

00:29:28.349 --> 00:29:32.399
an industry setting are going to be more on the side of being passive,

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:33.750
meaning just kind of grabbing

00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:36.210
information and reporting them back or do you think it's going to be more

00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:39.329
active in the sense of taking that information and kind of moving

00:29:39.329 --> 00:29:43.480
forward collectively as a group to kind of solve a task?

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:46.924
I think that's a good first step, for sure.

00:29:46.924 --> 00:29:50.954
But there is only a step from that to actually creating a Wi-Fi network

00:29:50.954 --> 00:29:55.964
or depositing something in the environment or cleaning up an oil spill.

00:29:55.964 --> 00:29:59.159
So I think it helps to think of these systems as actually doing

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:01.650
something meaningful in their environment and

00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:04.259
what that something is will depend on the application.

00:30:04.259 --> 00:30:10.095
But you're right, deploying them and sensing something is a good first step.

00:30:10.095 --> 00:30:12.779
Now I know we're talking about a lot of different groups here and we're

00:30:12.779 --> 00:30:15.875
talking about a lot of cross-disciplinary studies and work.

00:30:15.875 --> 00:30:18.900
I mean, obviously at your lab you're saying you have roboticist engineers,

00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:25.855
electrical engineers, other types of people, biologists as well.

00:30:25.855 --> 00:30:29.160
How important is it that these groups kind of communicate together and how

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:33.195
important is it for them to make sure that the communication,

00:30:33.194 --> 00:30:36.884
the language that you use differs typically from field to field just slightly.

00:30:36.884 --> 00:30:41.335
And it's enough that sometimes it can cause confusion when talking to another field.

00:30:41.335 --> 00:30:43.215
For instance, some words might mean,

00:30:43.214 --> 00:30:45.896
have one definition in terms of biology,

00:30:45.896 --> 00:30:48.599
but when you're talking to a roboticist it might mean something slightly different.

00:30:48.599 --> 00:30:51.064
I know in reinforcement learning, computer scientist,

00:30:51.065 --> 00:30:54.240
the way that they view reinforcement learning is slightly different than a psychologist.

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:57.089
How important is it that we have this communication and this broad sense of

00:30:57.089 --> 00:30:58.889
understanding of everybody's field to kind of make sure

00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:01.005
that we're collaborating correctly?

00:31:01.005 --> 00:31:04.447
That's so important.

00:31:04.446 --> 00:31:09.269
So, the way we do it is we have swarm lunches and

00:31:09.269 --> 00:31:11.430
we force everyone to

00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:14.160
explain what they're doing to the other people who aren't necessarily,

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:15.970
exactly in the same field.

00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:18.345
Because you're right that there are very different languages.

00:31:18.345 --> 00:31:23.555
So, going from swarms of flying robots to nanomedicine required essentially learning

00:31:23.555 --> 00:31:26.910
an entirely new language to be able to get to the point

00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:30.285
where we were making progress and what we wanted to do.

00:31:30.285 --> 00:31:33.380
And I think the key there is very often people think of

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:37.770
cross-disciplinary as two different disciplines coming together.

00:31:37.769 --> 00:31:42.095
And I'm much more keen on creating cross-disciplinary people.

00:31:42.095 --> 00:31:44.259
So, the reason we always get our hands dirty

00:31:44.259 --> 00:31:47.250
as in we'll make a model simulation discover swarm behavior

00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:49.769
but then we'll actually implement it is because I

00:31:49.769 --> 00:31:52.585
think that's one of the only ways to make cross-disciplinary people.

00:31:52.585 --> 00:31:55.480
They need to be a little bit uncomfortable as they go along.

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:56.995
So that their algorithm,

00:31:56.994 --> 00:31:58.859
they'll see that it doesn't work at all when they

00:31:58.859 --> 00:32:00.767
test it in reality and then they need to

00:32:00.768 --> 00:32:01.930
actually approach the people in

00:32:01.930 --> 00:32:05.170
those areas to figure out why it hasn't worked in reality.

00:32:05.170 --> 00:32:06.960
And then, to do that they need learn language.

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:10.920
At some point if everyone is doing that within a team you

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:15.250
somehow end up with a common base language that allows you to communicate.

00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:17.420
And then, there's the details that sometimes get lost.

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:19.890
But actually those details sometimes shouldn't

00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:22.841
be communicated in the way that they get lost.

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:26.704
The students get into a habit of not using all this jargon.

00:32:26.704 --> 00:32:30.144
They realize that the person across the aisle has no idea what they're talking about.

00:32:30.144 --> 00:32:34.424
So, I think it's super fun to create cross-disciplinary environments,

00:32:34.424 --> 00:32:39.629
not just having different disciplines but people who cross disciplines.

00:32:39.630 --> 00:32:41.190
It's a fun thing to do.

00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:44.240
It's a hard thing to do because very often,

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:48.690
society and research and whatnot values expertise in niche areas,

00:32:48.690 --> 00:32:52.480
and I would love for us to celebrate more people who are part disciplinary,

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:54.349
could sit on these edges,

00:32:54.349 --> 00:32:56.849
or in between these different fields,

00:32:56.849 --> 00:33:00.444
because that it in itself is a skill I think that's really helpful. I think so.

00:33:00.444 --> 00:33:03.859
I feel like that something that we're moving more and more towards these days is

00:33:03.859 --> 00:33:07.969
the ability to be able to be good in multiple fields and not just one anymore.

00:33:07.970 --> 00:33:10.680
I think there was a point in time where it's very simple to say

00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:14.445
that you were good at electrical engineering and that was kind of your area.

00:33:14.444 --> 00:33:16.404
You were good at coding and that was your area.

00:33:16.404 --> 00:33:18.375
You were good at math and that was your area.

00:33:18.375 --> 00:33:20.835
But it seems like as things have evolved,

00:33:20.835 --> 00:33:23.535
even in the scientific community as a whole,

00:33:23.535 --> 00:33:26.545
it's not good enough to be good at just electrical engineering anymore,

00:33:26.545 --> 00:33:29.640
or just good at mechanical engineering or just good at physics.

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:34.365
You have to be able to blend these boundaries together and say,

00:33:34.365 --> 00:33:39.194
"Well, I'm really a physicist at heart but I can do some electrical engineering as well.

00:33:39.194 --> 00:33:43.859
Or I'm a really good mathematician but I'm also a pretty good computer scientist."

00:33:43.859 --> 00:33:46.289
I think as we kind of see this world blend together,

00:33:46.289 --> 00:33:49.049
do you think we're going to see more and more of almost

00:33:49.049 --> 00:33:52.079
like these cross specializations start to emerge?

00:33:52.079 --> 00:33:54.480
And are these going to be helpful, do you think,

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:59.360
in particular, in the field of robotics words, it's so cross-disciplinary?

00:33:59.359 --> 00:34:01.519
Yeah, I really hope so.

00:34:01.519 --> 00:34:04.000
I think it's valuable for two reasons.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.335
One, because of the new discoveries you make,

00:34:06.335 --> 00:34:12.110
because you're sitting in the space that's potentially unexplored.

00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:14.300
The other is because it allows you to be more

00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:17.265
flexible in what you want to do or what you want to study.

00:34:17.264 --> 00:34:19.775
And so, if you're used to moving across boundaries,

00:34:19.775 --> 00:34:26.235
then you're not held back as much in terms of exploring completely new things.

00:34:26.235 --> 00:34:28.870
So when my colleague was talking about synthetic biology, I was like, "Oh, yeah.

00:34:28.869 --> 00:34:30.674
We should explore that. We should do that."

00:34:30.675 --> 00:34:34.385
And I think, it's much easier to do if you've lost somehow,

00:34:34.385 --> 00:34:36.840
your home base, and you've already

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:39.960
started to explore the world or the different disciplines.

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:41.720
And I think the more we can do that,

00:34:41.719 --> 00:34:44.214
the more we'll make very exciting discoveries.

00:34:44.215 --> 00:34:47.510
So there's this interesting notion I feel from being

00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:51.185
an expert in an area and kind of slowly exploring another area,

00:34:51.184 --> 00:34:56.329
where you're so used to being so knowledgeable about your area so well

00:34:56.329 --> 00:34:57.949
and you have so much expertise in

00:34:57.949 --> 00:35:01.609
one particular topic that once you start to merge into another area,

00:35:01.610 --> 00:35:03.275
all of a sudden, you realize that there's

00:35:03.275 --> 00:35:05.360
this whole huge learning curve that you're about to

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:10.215
face again of trying to get ramped up in that new area.

00:35:10.215 --> 00:35:12.260
What are some of the techniques or what are

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:16.460
some advice that you would give to some people out there who are interested

00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:19.699
in exploring another area but are getting kind of discouraged right away with

00:35:19.699 --> 00:35:23.549
the amount of information that that's kind of in front of them that they have to digest?

00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:25.840
So the way I did it is that,

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:29.184
I was playing around these flying robots for my PhD and I thought,

00:35:29.184 --> 00:35:30.989
"Oh, I really want to do nanomedicine."

00:35:30.989 --> 00:35:34.339
So I picked up the most complicated book I could and read all about

00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:39.275
cancer for whatever time it took me to finish that huge book.

00:35:39.275 --> 00:35:42.235
And I didn't understand a word of it, frankly.

00:35:42.235 --> 00:35:46.914
It was just sort of a way to immerse myself in the language that they were using.

00:35:46.914 --> 00:35:49.670
And the key thing for me was to actually go to a lab.

00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:53.075
So I was lucky then to be over at MIT actually and said,

00:35:53.074 --> 00:35:54.779
"Oh, you want to do some nano course?

00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:56.017
Oh, yeah. Sure. That's fine. Come along."

00:35:56.016 --> 00:35:59.599
You kind of need someone to take a risk on you so that you

00:35:59.599 --> 00:36:03.914
can immerse yourself in the environment that you want to learn.

00:36:03.914 --> 00:36:05.590
It's a little bit like learning a new language, right?

00:36:05.590 --> 00:36:10.220
The best place to learn is to actually go to the place where they speak that language.

00:36:10.219 --> 00:36:13.369
So spending time there was pretty much, I think,

00:36:13.369 --> 00:36:17.460
the best way to figure out how this new discipline works,

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:21.965
but I also think you need to keep an expertise,

00:36:21.965 --> 00:36:24.930
not just jump from field to fields.

00:36:24.929 --> 00:36:27.409
So my key expertise is more of engineering and I

00:36:27.409 --> 00:36:30.379
do that across scales for a number of different agents.

00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:32.380
And this is actually advice wrapped in rag.

00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:35.164
It means you need to be an expert in something.

00:36:35.164 --> 00:36:39.500
And so that's my expertise and I take that with me so that I don't start from

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:44.344
scratch every time I tackle a new type of skill or a new type of agent.

00:36:44.344 --> 00:36:46.549
And that allows me to have something that's reassuring,

00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:52.120
something that I have been studying for over a decade and that I can fall back to.

00:36:52.119 --> 00:36:54.789
I'm just using it in new and interesting ways.

00:36:54.789 --> 00:36:56.291
So having this sort of foot hole,

00:36:56.291 --> 00:36:57.780
the thing that you're confident about,

00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:02.165
but then pushing yourself to go into these these different directions,

00:37:02.164 --> 00:37:07.059
I think, is at least what what helped me.

00:37:07.059 --> 00:37:10.239
Great. When trying to break into

00:37:10.239 --> 00:37:12.969
the field of swarm engineering or study the field of swarm engineering,

00:37:12.969 --> 00:37:18.730
what do you feel are some of the most crucial skills that somebody could have?

00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:24.184
It really depends.

00:37:24.184 --> 00:37:27.385
So it really depends because depending on what your background is,

00:37:27.385 --> 00:37:30.365
you can come at it from different angles.

00:37:30.364 --> 00:37:34.079
If you're good at math, you can do the maths of how these systems organize.

00:37:34.079 --> 00:37:35.710
And if you're good in computer programming,

00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:39.280
you can start to create simulations where you start to see robots that interact and can

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:43.195
you program them in a way they achieve a desired swarm behavior.

00:37:43.195 --> 00:37:45.280
If you're good at hardware, you can start to think of, "Okay.

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:48.880
Well actually, if I'm going to make an outdoor swarm of a thousand robots,

00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:51.355
how should I build that robot and what are

00:37:51.355 --> 00:37:54.304
the mechanical components so that it can go over rough terrain?

00:37:54.304 --> 00:37:55.960
And what is the sensing so that it can sense

00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:59.644
its local environment to communicate with its local neighborhood?"

00:37:59.644 --> 00:38:01.480
If you're good in biology, you could say actually,

00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:04.414
"What kind of interesting behaviors are animals doing?

00:38:04.414 --> 00:38:05.980
And if I studied that,

00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:09.550
would that be helpful for this swarm robotics world?"

00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:11.920
If you're into chemistry, you could say actually,

00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:15.099
"We're going to need to make these robots outdoors that work in huge numbers.

00:38:15.099 --> 00:38:16.659
They're going to need to be biodegradable.

00:38:16.659 --> 00:38:19.375
What new materials would be useful for these robots?"

00:38:19.375 --> 00:38:22.449
So there there is no one way to approach swarm robotics.

00:38:22.449 --> 00:38:24.835
I think we need all of these expertise and

00:38:24.835 --> 00:38:27.490
the key thing that unifies us I think is a problem.

00:38:27.489 --> 00:38:31.934
So if we can figure out one thing that we're trying to solve,

00:38:31.934 --> 00:38:34.730
one application area, then I think that's where we can start to say,

00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:36.525
"Okay, I'm trying to tackle this problem.

00:38:36.525 --> 00:38:39.570
What can my discipline bring to this question?"

00:38:39.570 --> 00:38:42.795
And then use that as a starting point.

00:38:42.795 --> 00:38:50.829
What problems that exist right now that are challenging for a swarm roboticist?

00:38:50.829 --> 00:38:54.174
So there's the biomedical field that I mentioned.

00:38:54.175 --> 00:38:57.110
Do you mean just in terms of the theory?

00:38:57.110 --> 00:38:59.620
Just in terms of on either side,

00:38:59.619 --> 00:39:01.690
either the practicality or the theory.

00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:04.150
So, I'm sure there's a lot of interesting problems

00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:07.135
because I've heard it both ways from people who are like,

00:39:07.135 --> 00:39:09.640
"Swarm theory, swarm intelligence,

00:39:09.639 --> 00:39:12.789
swarm robotics is the next really big area that's really going to take off."

00:39:12.789 --> 00:39:15.474
We see a lot of people in academia kind of study in this area

00:39:15.474 --> 00:39:17.380
and I think there's some really interesting work

00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:19.135
and interesting research that's coming out of it.

00:39:19.135 --> 00:39:23.350
However, you can talk to some people in the field and they'll say, "Ah, swarm robotics,

00:39:23.349 --> 00:39:27.009
there really isn't too much of an application for it in the real world and I know

00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:28.750
a lot of people like do it in the lab but we

00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:30.909
haven't really seen that really crossover yet."

00:39:30.909 --> 00:39:33.069
So from your perspective,

00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:38.350
what are some of the interesting places that you can apply swarm theory or some of

00:39:38.349 --> 00:39:43.775
the challenges of applying swarm theory in the next five, 10 years?

00:39:43.775 --> 00:39:48.295
Our real challenge is that we need to make swarm robotics real.

00:39:48.295 --> 00:39:52.095
So a lot of it is done in a laboratory if you think of the robot scale.

00:39:52.094 --> 00:39:54.539
And we need to figure out how to do this outdoors.

00:39:54.539 --> 00:40:00.034
So that means we need to build robot platforms that work outdoors in large numbers,

00:40:00.034 --> 00:40:03.144
and we need to discover algorithms that work in those large numbers,

00:40:03.144 --> 00:40:06.210
and we need to make sure that our robots are safe by design,

00:40:06.210 --> 00:40:07.840
maybe biodegradable or disposable,

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:11.030
so we need to be clever about how we design the materials themselves.

00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:15.190
So there's still many research challenges along those fronts.

00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:16.480
On the biomedical side,

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:19.119
I think we're actually closer to application because

00:40:19.119 --> 00:40:22.228
even if you don't make bacteria or nanoparticles that swarm.

00:40:22.228 --> 00:40:24.489
There's really important questions to answer

00:40:24.489 --> 00:40:28.419
about how collectives in these systems operate.

00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:33.400
So I think that's actually a very good application for swarm robotics if we

00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:38.369
bring them to the micro-nano-scale just because the agents already exist at those scales.

00:40:38.369 --> 00:40:41.554
And we already work in huge numbers and they're begging to be controlled.

00:40:41.554 --> 00:40:46.839
So that that's sort of where I see the near term applications.

00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:48.490
But what we need to do, the challenge,

00:40:48.489 --> 00:40:51.219
is making these things real.

00:40:51.219 --> 00:40:55.038
Right. Sabine, thank you very much for your time today. I appreciate it.

00:40:55.038 --> 00:40:58.179
Great. Thank you.
