00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Many operating systems allow you to submit bug reports

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
more or less automatically as soon as a program crashes.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
This is the dialog that appears on a mac os system.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Essentially Apple asks you just one single question,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and that is again the steps necessary to reproduce the problem.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Everything else can be deduced from that one.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
On top of that the bug report also includes

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
problem details and system configuration,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
which is, for instance, the version number of the program that crashed,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
the current process, date and time,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
the functions that were active at the moment of the crash,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
as well as any hardware attached to the machine.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Here are the steps needed to reproduce the problem,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and we send the whole thing to Apple.
