00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.129
Hey guys! Kevin the backyard scientist here today

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.259
and today we're going to be cooking with science (or at least trying to) I mean it's perfect timing because we just got all of this food from

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.039
Blue Apron (this video is actually sponsored by Blue apron) and Sandra

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.259
and I are gonna have a contest to see who can cook the food the best.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:14.680
[Sandra] I'm gonna win.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.920
[Kevin] She thinks she is. I'm gonna try (it's probably not going to be that great) but we're going to try anyway.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.140
And we're each going to choose a meal and cook it, so you ready? [Sandra]Ready. [Kevin] All right. Let's do it.

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:32.188
Let's get started, and I forgot, I don't actually know what I'm cooking right now, so Sandra, what am I going to be cooking?

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:33.910
[No response] This

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.500
Shrimp and Fresh, how do you say it?

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:43.440
[Sandra] Gnocchi. [Kevin] gno- gno- gna-  *gnocchi*. Nah, I don't think so. But, I don't know what it is,

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.600
hopefully I didn't say its wrong. Now let's actually get started

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.440
Okay, step 1, prepare the ingredients, done. Step 2, blister the tomatoes. Right here, blister the tomatoes.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.250
And I think that I have the perfect tool for that.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:00.460
This right here is a carbon arc light. It's powered by a welder that puts out about 23 volts at 80 amps,

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.938
and that's 1800 watts of power that are going through these two carbon electrodes right here. Now these things are

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.960
adjustable so I can get it just in the right focal length of this parabolic dish which is actually just a lampshade that I got

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.040
at Goodwill , it does the job really good though. Let's try it out. So this is a normal flashlight

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.100
It's about 300 lumens, and you can kinda see it flashing around here now. Let's check out the arc light

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.720
Flash light. Dude this thing is crazy!

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:43.040
Let me demonstrate this power by aiming at a piece of cardboard and yeah a large portion of this light given off by this is

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.200
ultraviolet light so

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.200
Yeah

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.200
Yeah

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.180
Okay

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.180
Now let's try it on the tomatoes

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:15.148
I've got the arc lamp precariously perched right here, and I think it's time to blister these tomatoes

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.869
This is about the focal point right there...

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.540
Let's see

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.060
Yep, I'd say that those have been blistered

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.920
[Sandra]So what's next on the list.. corn? [The genius of inventions]Yep corn.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.420
So this is going to be a fun one I get to use one of my old inventions to try to cook this corn

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.420
So lets get to the garage and I'll show you

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.908
So the instructions say "Put the corn in the oven for

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:01.729
30 minutes at 300 degrees" now if I put it in my kiln that's at

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.440
1500 Degrees

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.469
It should only take six minutes. No problem right. For our next test. We're going to be playing with some electricity

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:11.450
Actually playing is probably a bad word

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.549
We're going to be experimenting with electricity

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:19.190
So the distance is an electric arc can travel and jump through air is pretty much determined by the voltage of the electricity

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.300
So here let's say this neon sign Transformer is twelve Thousand Volts

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:31.740
The Earth can pretty much jump about a centimeter now if it was 20,000 volts it could jump two centimeters thirty thousand volts three centimeters

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.320
And so on you get the idea

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:38.299
Basically that means that air is acting like an insulator it prevents the electrons from going where they want to go

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.879
So say we try electricity in a vacuum?

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.099
And that should create a longer Arc because there's not enough air to get in a way of the electrons. Let's try it. Alright.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.650
turning on the vacuum

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:50.819
And let's connect the electricity

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.649
Now you'll see but there's still a lot of air in there

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.099
And it's not going to create an ARC until most of the air is evacuated

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.189
Boom. Now we have electricity going

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:06.340
I'm Switching out the neon sign Transformer with something a little bit more powerful this right here is a microwave oven transformer.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.120
We got the Shrimp's in here. Let me turn on the vacuum

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.679
And now let's see some plasma. Cook shrimps cook!

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.929
Now that's how you cook some shrimp right there

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:35.170
Well I don't think that this experiment cooked the shrimp as much as I hoped it would but I think the next experiment should be able to redeem us

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.400
Hey, how's the beams going? Going good! How's the corn going?

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:43.560
Uh...

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:45.580
It's going good.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:46.980
Oh jeez

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.620
Oh wow that's hot

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.800
Okay... uh

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.460
Okay, I'm just going to look that cool down a bit. Let's try the next one.

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.160
Today we're going to be preparing our garlic and spices using manganese heptoxide

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.920
Now that is a very interesting chemical one of my favorites because it sets everything it touches on fire

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.720
I think you can understand why that's one of my favorite chemicals

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:20.739
It's just two simple ingredients sulfuric acid that's concentrated like 98% and then potassium permanganate

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.889
Sulfuric acid and let's just add a little bit there. Just a splash and let's mix in a little bit of this.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.200
Oo that's a lot

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.949
Okay to demonstrate how crazy this stuff is let me put in a little bit of paper towel

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:37.950
And you'll see it instantly catch on fire

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.639
Okay, so the recipe also calls for some crushed red pepper flake. Let's try those out

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.160
Okay, now let's try a little bit of garlic

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:18.030
Aw It's just too bad I guess this garlic isn't going to make it into the dinner

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:23.189
Well the corn is all dry now. So let's open it up and see what it looks like

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.120
I don't know guys

00:06:28.599 --> 00:06:30.599
Ha! Haha!

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:33.690
Here is the corn look at that

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:40.769
Totally carbonized right now. I just turn the corn into a lump of charcoal. Let's see how much it weighs right now

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.110
so the corn weighs

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:49.820
23-24 grams.. not even an ounce and that's funny because at first the corn weighed almost a pound before

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.200
I carbonized it so I should just be able to set the corn on fire

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.760
See that?

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.840
That is corn on the cob charcoal right there. You could cook some corn on the cob using this

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:08.680
Well I think that the meal is complete so let's go inside and compare to Sandra's meal and see how we did

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:14.180
Ok. So this is what it's supposed to look like according to the menu card with all the ingredients that looks pretty good

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:16.190
Let's see what I got

00:07:17.169 --> 00:07:19.169
How do you like that?

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:24.479
Why is your food on fire? Well instead of cooking the pasta? I thought I could just soak it in alcohol

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.480
Set it on fire and that it would

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:27.900
ugh ... cook

00:07:27.909 --> 00:07:34.049
in front of us you know like a romantic candlelit dinner. So this is a contest. We have to you know test each other's food

00:07:34.049 --> 00:07:39.300
So you can test my food I'll test your food. This looks delicious. Let's see who wins ok?

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:41.780
Uhh let's not.

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.080
Oh come on. Where's the sport now?

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:45.680
Oh my God.

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:48.840
Uh..

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.120
That'll be done.

00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:59.068
But really guys I got to give a thank-you shout-out to blue apron Foods for donating all that food for scientific purposes

00:07:59.229 --> 00:08:05.218
blue apron is a recipe and delivery service that helps chefs with all levels cook incredible meals at home trust me

00:08:05.219 --> 00:08:10.529
I can use all the help I can get blue apron takes care of the menu planning and shopping giving you more time to work

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:15.030
In the garage so all you have to do is wash the grime off your  projects and enjoy

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:17.819
Or just wash the grime off your hands

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:23.319
So there's two types of plans you can get which is just a two person family plan which is perfect for my girlfriend

00:08:23.319 --> 00:08:29.649
Sandra and I and then there's the more advanced family plan which is for the whole family and I think that that is perfect if

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:31.550
You have a dog because she will try to eat

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:37.359
Anything you make so might as well get her her own food because she's going to try to steal some of yours nice try

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:41.469
All blue apron boxes are delivered in a refrigerated package

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:46.929
