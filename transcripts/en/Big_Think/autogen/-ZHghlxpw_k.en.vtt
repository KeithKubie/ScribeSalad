invest to find new all your fields we

invest to find new all your fields we
may see much higher prices than we have

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:51.720
may see much higher prices than we have
 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.260
may see much higher prices than we have
seen in the past and this could have a

very bad implications for the global

very bad implications for the global
economy for all the countries in the

economy for all the countries in the
 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.880
economy for all the countries in the
world major consumer countries such as

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890
world major consumer countries such as
 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.260
world major consumer countries such as
the US China or European countries but

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270
the US China or European countries but
 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.590

as well as for the producing countries

as well as for the producing countries

because oil is one of the major revenue

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:12.149
because oil is one of the major revenue
 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:15.590
because oil is one of the major revenue
generators so what we have to do is on

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600
generators so what we have to do is on
 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.679
generators so what we have to do is on
one hand we have to invest to find new

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689
one hand we have to invest to find new
 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.770
one hand we have to invest to find new
oil fields second perhaps much more

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780
oil fields second perhaps much more
 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.889
oil fields second perhaps much more
importantly is to slow down the oil

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:24.899
importantly is to slow down the oil
 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:27.800
importantly is to slow down the oil
demand quote and we can slow the oil

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810
demand quote and we can slow the oil
 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.269
demand quote and we can slow the oil
demand growth finding solution to our

00:01:31.269 --> 00:01:31.279
demand growth finding solution to our
 

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:34.099
demand growth finding solution to our
transportation sector problems we have

00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:34.109
transportation sector problems we have
 

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:37.099
transportation sector problems we have
to find cars we have to use cars much

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:37.109
to find cars we have to use cars much
 

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:39.379
to find cars we have to use cars much
more efficiently we have to look at the

00:01:39.379 --> 00:01:39.389
more efficiently we have to look at the
 

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:42.260
more efficiently we have to look at the
alternative technologies of cars such as

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270
alternative technologies of cars such as
 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.849
alternative technologies of cars such as
the biofuels or even more importantly

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:45.859
the biofuels or even more importantly
 

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:51.139
the biofuels or even more importantly
electric cars a oil sources are there it

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149
electric cars a oil sources are there it
 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.580
electric cars a oil sources are there it
is use it is till 2020 and so on but one

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590
is use it is till 2020 and so on but one
 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.289
is use it is till 2020 and so on but one
day if not 20 30 2013 2014 one day we

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299
day if not 20 30 2013 2014 one day we
 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.269
day if not 20 30 2013 2014 one day we
will run out of oil the Scimitar of time

00:02:02.269 --> 00:02:02.279
will run out of oil the Scimitar of time
 

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:04.489
will run out of oil the Scimitar of time
so what we have to do is we have to

00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:04.499
so what we have to do is we have to
 

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:07.249
so what we have to do is we have to
prepare ourselves for that day and if we

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259
prepare ourselves for that day and if we
 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:13.900
prepare ourselves for that day and if we
have to leave oil before oil leaves us

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910
 
 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.050
 
I think a first of all our first task is

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060
I think a first of all our first task is
 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.310
I think a first of all our first task is
to postpone the day of a peak and to do

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320
to postpone the day of a peak and to do
 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.510
to postpone the day of a peak and to do
that we have to a invest in oil fits and

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520
that we have to a invest in oil fits and
 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.440
that we have to a invest in oil fits and
we have plenty of oil mainly in the OPEC

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450
we have plenty of oil mainly in the OPEC
 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.890
we have plenty of oil mainly in the OPEC
countries in a Middle East the spirit of

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900
countries in a Middle East the spirit of
 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.170
countries in a Middle East the spirit of
older we have to see that investment is

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180
older we have to see that investment is
 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.260
older we have to see that investment is
done in order to explore new oil fields

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270
done in order to explore new oil fields
 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.600
done in order to explore new oil fields
and develop the existing fields second a

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610
and develop the existing fields second a
 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.840
and develop the existing fields second a
industry and business need to look at

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850
industry and business need to look at
 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.120
industry and business need to look at
the alternative option in the

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130
the alternative option in the
 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.970
the alternative option in the
transportation sector today more than

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980
transportation sector today more than
 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.240
transportation sector today more than
ninety five percent of the growth in oil

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250
ninety five percent of the growth in oil
 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.490
ninety five percent of the growth in oil
demand comes from the transportation

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500
demand comes from the transportation
 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.630
demand comes from the transportation
sector namely cars trucks and jets so we

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640
sector namely cars trucks and jets so we
 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.030
sector namely cars trucks and jets so we
have to find a way industry has to find

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040
have to find a way industry has to find
 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.580
have to find a way industry has to find
a way to get a with the government's to

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590
a way to get a with the government's to
 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.610
a way to get a with the government's to
find new mods new modalities for

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620
find new mods new modalities for
 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.700
find new mods new modalities for
transportation this our first task to

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:12.710
transportation this our first task to
 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.850
transportation this our first task to
postpone the peak and then if we are

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860
postpone the peak and then if we are
 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.520
postpone the peak and then if we are
very prepared for the day that the

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530
very prepared for the day that the
 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.570
very prepared for the day that the
global oil production goes down we can

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580
global oil production goes down we can
 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.170
global oil production goes down we can
find solutions to the significant

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180
find solutions to the significant
 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.130
find solutions to the significant
economic challenges we may face
