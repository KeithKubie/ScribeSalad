00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.170
&gt;&gt; David Mao: Good
afternoon everyone.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.460
Welcome to the Library of Congress.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.130
Welcome to this celebratory
event for a great day here --

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.800
finally have some nice weather
here in Washington, and I'm so glad

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.960
that it's happening today.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.840
We are here to celebrate the
winners of the 2015 Library

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.350
of Congress Literacy Awards.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.540
My name is David Mao and I
have the privilege of serving

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.530
as the Acting Librarian of Congress
and again, welcome to the library.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.120
The Library of Congress
Literacy Awards originated with

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.070
and is sponsored by
philanthropist David Rubenstein.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.100
The awards -- first
announced in January 2013 --

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.590
helps support organizations
that worked to promote reading

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.210
and literacy in the United
States and around the world.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.350
The awards highlight and reward
organizations for their exemplary,

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.940
innovative, and easily
replicable work.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.600
Now these awards, they
benefit not only the winners,

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.970
but also new groups,
organizations, and individuals

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.040
through the best practices
of all of our applicants.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.140
And so anywhere around the
world, people can be involved

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.590
in alleviating the
scourge of illiteracy.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.790
And that's one of the benefits
of all of these awards.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.130
We're very fortunate to have

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.020
with us today our very generous
benefactor, David Rubenstein.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.750
He has perfected what he has
called "patriotic philanthropy"

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.230
through the many gifts to
institutions around the country

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.790
and more specifically, in this
area -- to the Kennedy Center,

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.220
the Washington Memorial -- I'm
sorry, the Washington Monument,

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.740
the National Zoo -- and if you
read the news just this past Monday

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.750
announcing a great gift to help
recreate the Lincoln Memorial.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.650
And so we're very, very
privileged to have David

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.640
as a very generous sponsor
to the Library of Congress

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.250
and he's been a sponsor and a
patron to us for many, many years.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.960 position:56%
His projects -- the projects that
we have here would not be achievable

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.260
without his great support.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.760 position:56%
And we thank him very much for that.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.520
One in particular that I will
just mention since it's related

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.560
to the literacy awards that we're
celebrating today is the Library

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.170
of Congress National Book Festival
which is now in its 16th year.

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.230
And we are very grateful
that David funds the program

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.060
through his generosity.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.030 position:56%
Now, when David is not being a
philanthropist, he is the co-founder

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.150
and co-CEO of the Carlyle Group.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.370
He is sitting right here in
the front row so I would ask

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.700
that you join me in acknowledging

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.510
and thanking David Rubenstein
for all of his support.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:53.520
[ Applause ]

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.070 position:56%
For the past three years, the awards
have been administered by the Center

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.520
for the Book in the
Library of Congress.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.520
The Director is Dr. John Cole.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.870
And John is right over here.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.860
So I want to acknowledge the staff
of the Center for the Book and,

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.750
in particular, Dr. Cole, for
the great work that they've done

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.180
in contributing to the
success of the awards.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.480
Thank you.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.780
[ Applause ]

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.580
Thank you, John.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.320
[ Applause ]

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.830
In addition, over the last three
years, we've had the benefit

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.270
of the Literacy Awards
Advisory Board.

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.350
And they have given
their time and expertise

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.510
to make these excellent
selections every year.

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.160 position:56%
So for those members of the Literacy
Awards Advisory Board that are here

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.160
with us, thank you very much
for your generous contributions

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.460
to the success of this program.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.260
Thank you.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.940
[ Applause ]

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.240
Now at this time, I'm very pleased

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.360
to introduce a very special
guest, Michael Dirda.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.760
Renown book critic for
the Washington Post.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.530
He is a graduate of Oberlin
College and has a doctorate

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.640
in Comparative Literature
from Cornell University.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.110
Since 1978, Michael has enlightened
readers with his opinions

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.970
on writers -- both very well-known
and, perhaps, not so famous.

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.630
And he even received a Pulitzer
Price for criticism in 1993.

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.580
He has help readers discover
forgotten masterpieces

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.780
and brought needed attention
to the classics in the making,

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.870
so we're very excited to
have Michael Dirda with us.

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.170
Please join me.

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:23.970
Thank you.

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:35.610
[ Applause ]

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:36.910
&gt;&gt; Michael Dirda: Thank you, David.

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.210
First of all, can you
all hear me all right?

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:39.510
It's fine?

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.810
Signal wildly if you can't.

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.330
I was lucky enough to be
taught to read by my mother.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.890
After finishing the
dishes, she would plop

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:54.350
down on the dining room floor next
to the heat register and take me,

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.120
washed up, ready for
bed, onto her lap.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.690
There on the floor, she would
then open a tattered Golden Book

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.910
and point with a fingertip --

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:09.970 position:56%
red and wrinkled by detergent in hot
water -- to the books first page.

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.270
"Look, Michael.

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.580
See the cute yellow chicky.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:19.010
Or the pokey little puppy
or the very naughty bunny."

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:23.620
As I snuggled there in my
mother's lap, feeling the warm air

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.890
of the furnace blowing on me,

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:29.170
I would drift into a
contented sleepiness.

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.830
Over time though, I
began to pay more

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.370
and more attention to
the books themselves.

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.310
Probably because my beloved mother
seemed to derive so much pleasure

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.660
from the pictures and those
funny little squiggles.

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:47.030 position:56%
On the day I can no longer remember,

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.550
I deduced like a four-year-old
Sherlock Holmes

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:54.930
that those squiggles were
the letters -- C-A-T --

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.310
were pronounced cat and stood

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.740
for the animal pictured
on the page above.

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:04.830
When John Cole asked me to speak
at this afternoons ceremony

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:09.020
for the Literacy Awards, I began
to mull over what I might say.

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:14.480
We hear a great deal these
days about computer literacy,

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:18.390
but sometimes forget that
it is print literacy --

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:21.130
the ability to understand the
meaning of written words --

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:27.800
which actually ushers most of us
into a world larger than ourselves.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.010
Learning to read though
isn't at all intuitive.

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:35.900
It takes hard work and persistence
on the part of parents, teachers,

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.290
and organizations like
those we honor today.

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:42.400
Before a child can suddenly
achieve that eureka moment --

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.550
when the letters C-A-T --

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:47.430
the picture of [inaudible]
animal playing a ball of yarn,

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:50.970
and the word "cat,"
all come together.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.520
Once these fundamental
interconnections are made though,

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:02.980
the truly life enhancing stages
of literacy actually begin.

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:06.230
These stages might be
labeled enchantment,

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:09.740
understanding, and power.

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:13.890
Our earliest reading is
the age of adventure.

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:15.510
We pick up books for excitement.

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:16.810
For wonder.

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:19.950
For the most basic enchantments
of plot and narrative.

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:25.400
In my own generation, we discover
stories with irresistible titles

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:29.830
like " Danny Dunn and
the Anti-Gravity Paint,"

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:34.850
" Miss Pickerell Goes to Mars,"
and "The Boxcar Children."

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:37.790
We follow the never ending
battles between Uncle Scrooge

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:40.350
and those dastardly Beagle Boys.

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:43.630
Roar manically over joke
books with titles like

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:46.030
"Yours Till Niagara Falls."

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:49.660
And eventually settled
down for a couple of years

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:54.830
with the endless adventures of
the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew.

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:57.030
A little later perhaps,

00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:00.860
the librarian might suggest
a book intriguingly titled

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:03.470
"The Secret Garden."

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:07.800
Or at the local Salvation Army,
we might unearth an old paperback

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:11.180
of "Journey to the
Center of the Earth."

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:15.690
Or a cousin would lend us the
short stories of Edgar Allan Poe.

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:20.220
In the 21st century, only
the particular titles might

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:21.520
be different.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:24.670
Kids read now about Harry
Potter rather than Tom Swift,

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:29.550
Jr. But the overall
pattern remains the same.

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:33.710
Still, it pleases me to
know that Beverly Clearly,

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:37.000
whose Henry Huggins
books I eagerly searched

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.970
for in third grade,
will be 100 in April.

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:49.060
As we all know, the true golden age
of reading is 12, or possibly 13.

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:51.750
Does life get any better
than the dark

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:54.040
and stormy night we
first turn the pages

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.880
of "The Hound of the Baskervilles?"

00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:00.620
On just such a night, I, myself
discovered the spectral hellhound

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:04.390
and learned of the curse laid
on the Baskerville family,

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:07.470
and listened as Dr. Mortimer
told of the recent death

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:09.120
of Sir Charles Baskerville.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:16.970
Near the body, Mortimer informed
Sherlock Holmes, were footprints.

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:23.080
The great detective immediately
asks, "A man's or a woman's?"

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:28.490
To which question, he receives what
is merely the most thrilling reply

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:31.150
in all of literature.

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:35.260
"Mr. Holmes, they were the
footprints of a gigantic hound."

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.500
[ Laughter ]

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:41.980 position:56%
While enchantment and excitement are
important to any reader of any age,

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:45.260
there does come a time
when one begins to yearn

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.000
for more than just escape.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.270
As we grow older, we realize that
books don't only transport us

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:58.040
to fairy lands forlorn; they also
tell us about the world we live in.

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:01.390
More and more, we read
to acquire knowledge.

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:05.100
In school, we learn
through book about history.

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:07.170
We study key works of literature.

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:11.330
We review our Latin, or
French, or Arabic grammars.

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:15.360
We prop up newspapers and
magazines -- or smart phones --

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:18.670
next to our bowl of breakfast
cereal to find out about politics

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:23.540
and current affairs and
the latest baseball scores.

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:27.820
Meanwhile, novels like "Pride
and Prejudice," and "The Red

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:31.000 position:56%
and The Black," teach us about love.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.190
Our horizons expand.

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:36.150
We enter adulthood.

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:40.950
Through such youthful reading,
we grow in understanding,

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:43.880
acquiring a sense of what the world
is like and what we need to know

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.620
to navigate our way through it.

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:50.780
Gradually true, we discover
the third gift of literacy.

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:53.380
A consciousness of power.

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:55.110
A confidence in ourselves.

00:10:55.110 --> 00:11:02.210 position:56%
When I was a boy, I devoured all the
self-help books of Dale Carnegie.

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:06.680
Best known for " How to Win
Friends and Influence People."

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:10.280
Throughout his work,
Carnegie repeatedly emphasized

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:14.630
that successful careers -- and to
some degree fulfilling lives --

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:17.340
come more readily to those who
could speak and write well,

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:21.880 position:56%
who know history, literature, and
the arts; who have read great books,

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:28.030
and have become, in the broadest
sense, educated men and women.

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:30.490
For all this popularity
among business people,

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:34.460
Carnegie was a strong
advocate of the liberal arts.

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:36.640
If you couldn't attend college --

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:40.960
and remember, he wrote during the
depression when many couldn't --

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:44.850
you could still go to the
library or the bookstore.

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:48.970
You could teach yourself
if you knew how to read.

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:54.560
Such a peon to literacy may now
sound a little old fashioned

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:58.810
in our age of Facebook and Twitter,
but if you consult the memoirs

00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:00.410
of poor kids who have made good,

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:03.350
you know that books
are always understood

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:06.420
as the key to their later success.

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:10.800
In prison, Malcolm X copied out
by hand the entire dictionary

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:14.810
so that he might improve his
vocabulary and better himself.

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:18.140
Or recently, a son of a
working class Italian father

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:21.970
and a Mexican mother, Dana Gioia,
would -- through reading --

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:24.990
rise to become the Chairman of the
National Endowment for the Arts

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:28.080
and one of the country's
finest poets.

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:32.630
Books and the knowledge found
in them enrich our souls, yes,

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:38.530
but they also form the
foundations for consequential life.

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:42.600
The reader's journey then
leads from enchantment

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.810
to understanding to power.

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:49.060
But it all begins with learning
to recognize the letters

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:51.700
of the alphabet on flashcards.

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:54.700
Then the simple words
in picture books.

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:57.310
Literacy is the engine
that drives the world.

00:12:57.310 --> 00:13:02.160
The illiterate and alliterate
only drift aimlessly.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.970
Those who can read,
those who love to read,

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:08.130
can go anywhere and do anything.

00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:11.970
Certainly, the three organizations
we honor today know this far better

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:13.430
than I.

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:16.670
They deserve our gratitude
and our applause.

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:18.470
Thank you.

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:31.260
[ Applause ]

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.200
&gt;&gt; David Mao: Thank you very much,
Michael, for those inspiring words

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:39.180
and a great way to start us off
as we now celebrate the awardees

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:42.450
because I have the pleasure
now of issuing those awards.

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:46.640
So I will ask that -- David,
if he will join me up here

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:48.940
so that we can honor our winners.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.460
Our first winner that we
will honor is the winner

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:03.740
of the David Rubenstein
prize and that is First Book,

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:06.510
represented by CEO, Kyle Zimmer.

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:29.570
[ Applause ]

00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:33.120
Our second awardee is the
winner of the American Prize,

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:36.510
United Through Reading,
represented by CEO Sally Ann Zoll.

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:54.100
[ Applause ]

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:58.590
And finally, the winner of the
International Prize, Beanstalk.

00:14:58.590 --> 00:15:01.510
Represented by CEO, Ginny Lunn.

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:26.040
[ Applause ]

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:29.100
Now, we will have an opportunity
to hear from each of our winners.

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:34.510
And we will first hear it
from Ginny -- from Beanstalk.

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:40.420
[ Applause ]

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:41.720
&gt;&gt; Ginny Lunn: Thank you very much.

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:44.950
It's truly a privilege to
be here this afternoon.

00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:48.080
And I'm really honored
to be amongst all of you.

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:51.760
Actually, last night, when
I arrived here from London,

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:53.410
I thought I was truly honored.

00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:55.780
My full name is Virginia.

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:58.390
When I arrived, it said,
"Welcome to Virginia."

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:00.760
[ Laughter ]

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:02.450
So I thought, "Oh, that's amazing.

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:04.450
Just for me."

00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:07.610
So, I have been to
the states before.

00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:13.130
When I was 18, I was a bit
of a struggling child myself.

00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:17.830
I didn't really know where I was
going or what I was aiming to do.

00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:21.860
And so I spent a year
in Oklahoma City.

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:24.470
I know some people might say,
"Why did you choose there?"

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:26.550
I think it, sort of, chose me.

00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:30.230
So I spent a year there
and then I went on

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:33.420
and joined a travelling carnival.

00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:35.990
So I always think of
America as the place

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:39.950
where it really kick-started
my career because I,

00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:42.670
sort of, learned about myself.

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:45.140
I went back and studied
English, and then I went

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:46.950
on to become a primary
school teacher.

00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:48.920
So I, kind of, think
it's this country

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:50.770
that has brought me here today.

00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:54.260
So I think the nation
for that, so thank you.

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:56.200
I'm here [inaudible]
about Beanstalk.

00:16:56.200 --> 00:17:01.620
Before I do that, I do want to
just say a few words of thanks.

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:07.910
I started the CEO in June this
year -- well, 2015 actually.

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:11.990 position:56%
So I haven't been the CEO for long
so I really feel I can't take credit

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:13.810
for the fact that we've
won this award.

00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:17.140
So I want to thank all the
children, the volunteers,

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:20.730
the schools we work with,
and all my Beanstalk team

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:23.210
who have made it possible
for us to win this award.

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:26.490
We're a small charity in
England with big ambitions.

00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:29.370
And to get this award
is just truly amazing.

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:31.850
And I'd like to thank
Jared Grading [phonetic]

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:35.900
who gave a recommendation.

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:39.100
And also Save the Children,
Melissa Smith,

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:41.300
who wrote a letter recommending us.

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:43.990
And Save the Children is one of our
partners who is helping us to grow

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:48.200
and develop across the
UK, which is amazing.

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.850
So, can I also thank
David Rubenstein

00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:52.150
and the Library of Congress.

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:54.010
I think what you're
doing here is incredible.

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:58.710
I have looked back
at the other awards.

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:02.760
Things like Planet Read, Reach
Out and Read, other organizations

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:04.060
who have won this awards.

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:07.190
And it's such a good practice,
I think it's really brilliant

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:09.000
that this even is taking place

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.670
because we can all learn
so much from each other.

00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:15.160
So thank you for that.

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:16.730
But what's Beanstalk?

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:20.200
I'm sure some of you are
thinking, "What is Beanstalk?"

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:27.960 position:56%
We were founded -- so I'm supposed
to nod at the back -- I wanted it --

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.380
Should be a picture of a woman.

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:32.680
There we go.

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:36.660
So I couldn't talk about Beanstalk
without recognizing our founder,

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:41.930
Susan Belgrave, who I see
as an inspirational woman,

00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:47.140
a role model who started
Beanstalk in 1973.

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:49.580
And we, kind of, call
her our magic bean

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:52.270
because she had an idea
-- she saw a problem.

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:53.770 position:56%
The problem was that there were lots

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:58.260
of children leaving primary
school unable to read well.

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:00.950
Sadly, that's still
pretty much the case today,

00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:02.980
although it is improving
in certain areas.

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:05.690
There are real pockets
around England

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:08.510
that are doing really poorly.

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:11.430
Susan saw that and she
gathered some of her friends

00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:15.220
around her kitchen table
and she hatched a plan.

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:18.270
And what she came up
with was really simple.

00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:21.470
And I think, sometimes, it's the
solutions that are just so simple

00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:24.940
that are the ones that can
make biggest difference.

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:26.940
So she recruited volunteers.

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:30.860
She trained them and then she
put them into primary schools

00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:32.930
to help those struggling readers.

00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:36.670
So they go in, twice a week,
consistently for a year.

00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:41.900
And we know in that time, it really
does turn children's lives around.

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:43.640
It's a model that works.

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:44.940
She started it.

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:50.620
And over 43 years later, what
she started with three volunteers

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:55.040
in seven schools, we now have
helped over 100,000 children.

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:58.080
We have over 3,000 volunteers.

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.370
And we're in over 1,200 schools.

00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:01.690
So it's growing.

00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:02.990
We have big ambition.

00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:05.440
We want to double what
we do by 2018.

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:08.650
I think, being here today and
helping us raise our profile,

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:11.600
is going to really
help us on that path.

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:14.850
And, I think, another thing that's
really important to stress is

00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:17.710
that it's all about
mobilizing local people.

00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:21.410
So a lot of what we do to get our
volunteers is mobilizing local

00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:26.630
people to join together and
help those struggling children.

00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:30.220
So it's mobilizing communities
to help the next generation.

00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:33.590
I think it is an amazing model.

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:37.030
So I'm going to now -- so
Susan -- thank you to Susan.

00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:39.040
[ Laughter ]

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:40.340
Could we now have the film.

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:43.500
I'm going to show you a short film
which has just been made recently

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:47.140
which is a story of one of our
reading helpers and the voice

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:48.650
of the child that she's helping.

00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:54.010
It's an animated film so
please, press that button.

00:20:57.110 --> 00:21:00.320
[ Music ]

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:03.320
So Ellie was afraid
to read at first.

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:06.260
So we played lots of I Spy
with colors rather than words

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:08.010
because they confused her.

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:09.310
[ Music ]

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:13.770
She absolutely loved
princesses and anything pink.

00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:16.530
So we read piles of
fairy tale comics.

00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:17.830
It was a struggle.

00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:23.330
But Ellie stuck at it and before
long, we were reading short books.

00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:26.230 position:56%
Her teacher said that Ellie's
always been shy of reading in class.

00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:29.660
But one day, when she was
handing out water bottles

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:32.350
with all the children's
names on them,

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:34.880
Ellie came over and
said, "I can do it.

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:37.010
I can read now."

00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:38.670

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:40.970
I watched Ellie grow in confidence.

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:42.980
It made me feel amazing.

00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:45.170
Just to think that she wasn't
afraid to read anymore.

00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:49.160
Become a Beanstalk
reading helper today

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:52.510
to make a lasting difference
to a child like Ellie.

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:58.090
[ Music ]

00:21:58.090 --> 00:22:00.280
&gt;&gt; Ginny Lunn: So it's very
simple -- straightforward --

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:03.360
and the school teacher
said to me the other day,

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:06.700
"It's all about the quality
of the reading helper.

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:09.580
They sprinkle our children with
magical fairy dust and open

00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:12.990
up the wonderful world
of books to them."

00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:15.080
So we know it works.

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:18.300
And we're trying to
do it more and more.

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:21.710
But also, it's not just
about delivering what we do.

00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:24.820
What's really important to me
and to the rest of Beanstalk is

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:28.770
that we are part of big
campaigns to take the message

00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:31.500
of what happens when
a child can't read.

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:34.720
When they feel that their
potential is limited.

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.830
You know, it's really important
that we get that message

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:39.690
out to get more support
to our children.

00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:41.830
So we join forces with --

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:46.550
that's just some examples
-- of local newspapers.

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:52.250
We're doing a campaign with
BBC Radio 4 this summer.

00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:54.770
We also partner with Mature times.

00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:56.070
That says what it is.

00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:59.640
Saga -- some of you don't
know is for 55 plus --

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:02.350
so we do partner with
people who can get

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:04.780
to the volunteers that
we want to reach.

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:06.750
Waitrose -- is there
Waitrose in the states?

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:08.050
I don't know.

00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:10.230
It's a big superstore
all across the UK.

00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:14.000
And basically, it's a
magazine read by millions.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.890
So we really do look to partner
and make innovative partnerships

00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:20.190
to get our message out there.

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:26.560
And also, part of our strategy
is to be part of big campaigns.

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:28.390 position:56%
We are a founding member of Read On,

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:31.930
Get On which is led
by Save the Children.

00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:35.450
But it's got hundreds
of partnerships all --

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:39.690
getting together, joining forces,
to help raise literacy levels

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:42.130
and make sure children do
not leave primary school --

00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:45.400
age 11 -- unable to read well.

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:48.440
So we're part of that and
very proud to be part of that.

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:51.420
Also a European campaign
called ELINET.

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:54.780
And another global campaign -- you
may have heard of Project Literacy

00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:56.560
which the Pearson's
[phonetic] are involved in --

00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:59.730
which is talking about
tackling global illiteracy.

00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:02.590 position:56%
So it's really important to be part
of that bigger picture which is why,

00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:05.960
I think, we're all here today --
because it's important to be part

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:10.160
of that over all, join
the course, do something

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:14.740
and make sure we can change
the lives, change the story,

00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:19.370
for thousands and thousands
of children and adults

00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:22.510
who are suffering with not
being able to read well.

00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:25.990
And I just wanted to
end with a thank you

00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:27.290
from the children of Beanstalk.

00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:29.680
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:35.780
[inaudible] I love my
reading [inaudible].

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:40.440
Yay!

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:42.240
Thank you.

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:51.050
[ Applause ]

00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:53.680
&gt;&gt; David Mao: And now, we'll
hear from United Through Reading.

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:57.540
&gt;&gt; Sally Zoll: Okay, John.

00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:58.840
I got the clicker.

00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:00.690
It's dangerous.

00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:03.670
Where's Michael who spoke to us?

00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:04.970
Thank you very much.

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:07.500
You suggested that your words
might be a little old fashioned?

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:09.680
For me it was the best
blast from the past

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:11.410
that I've had in a long time.

00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:12.750
So thank you very much.

00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:14.050
That was lovely.

00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:16.070
Thank you all in the
Library of Congress.

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:20.440
It's an incredible honor to be here
and accept this award on behalf

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:21.890
of United Through Reading.

00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:25.940
I would like to thank David Mao,
the Acting Librarian of Congress.

00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:27.750
David Rubenstein, of course.

00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:29.550
And John Cole, our good friend.

00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:32.160
And the National Advisory
Board to the Library

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:35.610
of Congress Literacy Awards,
thank you all so very much.

00:25:35.610 --> 00:25:38.180
I also would like to thanks friends
of United Through Reading who are

00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:42.370
with us today including
Mrs. Ellyn Dunford, General

00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:45.640
and Mrs. Carter Ham,
and special United

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:50.210
Through Reading beneficiaries,
Emma and Sam and Jackson.

00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:52.750
Thank you very much for being here.

00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:55.470
We are honored to be in the
company of amazing organizations

00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:57.520
like First Book and Beanstalk.

00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:00.540
And so, we're thrilled to share
a little bit about what we are

00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:02.840
at United Through Reading.

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:07.680
United Through Reading
was founded in 1989

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:10.920
and began serving the military
during the first Gulf War.

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:15.090
Our founder, Betty Mohlenbrock, was
the wife of a navy flight surgeon.

00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:18.740
And when he deployed to Vietnam,
their daughter was a year old.

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:24.510
When he returned, she didn't
recognize him a year later.

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:25.980
Betty was also a reading teacher

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:28.230
who saw children starting
school not prepared

00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:30.270
to read and unprepared to learn.

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:35.530 position:56%
And so these two experiences came
together for her with this bold idea

00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:37.580
that service members
could stay connected

00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:41.430
with each other during
separations through the simple act

00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:43.900
of reading a story book aloud.

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:47.390
And so, like you said
earlier, it is simple.

00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:51.100
What we do is very simple
but to profound effect.

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:55.330
Our mission is to unite military
families facing physical separation

00:26:55.330 --> 00:26:57.250
by facilitating the
bonding experience

00:26:57.250 --> 00:26:58.550
of reading aloud together.

00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:02.680
And our vision is that all
children will feel the security

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:06.430
of caring family relations
and develop a love of reading

00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:08.940
through that read aloud experience.

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:13.580
As many of you know, military
families face unique challenges.

00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:17.980
Despite incredible bravery,
resilience, and strength,

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:21.160
military families --
especially the children --

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:25.180
have increased risk factors or
are associated with frequent moves

00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:28.550
and deployments that
often bring instability

00:27:28.550 --> 00:27:30.650
to our military families.

00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:32.340
Research indicates that children

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:37.420
from active duty military families
experience significantly higher

00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:41.380
levels of emotional difficulties
during family separations

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:43.690
than children of the
general population.

00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:45.960
And in a recent study, one-third

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:50.720
of our military children surveyed
reported symptoms of anxiety.

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:53.650
Longer deployments are linked
to greater difficulties

00:27:53.650 --> 00:27:57.230
in children's social and
emotional functioning.

00:27:57.230 --> 00:28:01.820
And if that weren't distressing
enough, a recent study

00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:04.910
by the RAND Corporation
found an association

00:28:04.910 --> 00:28:08.210
between military children who
have endured long separations

00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:12.970
from a parent and lower
achievement in reading and math.

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:20.120
Counterbalancing these findings,
there's good news reported

00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:21.470
by numerous studies that point

00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:24.660
to a very simple thing
to help these children.

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:26.580
The single most important activity

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:30.200
for building earliest
emergent reading skills appears

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:32.410
to be reading aloud to children.

00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:33.710
It's simple.

00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:37.610
And this conclusion is
also at the very heart

00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:39.230
of United Through Reading.

00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:43.810
We use that treasured family
practice of story time

00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:48.280
to sustain healthy family
bonds during separations

00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:50.540
and alleviate the stress
for family members.

00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:54.680
And both are essential to
helping our at-risk children

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:56.190
in learning to love reading.

00:28:56.190 --> 00:29:00.330
The photo that you see right
now is of a young sailor who was

00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:05.430
at the Naval Medical Center in San
Diego recovering from wounds of war

00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:07.900 position:56%
when he participated in our program.

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:11.980
And reading together was a
great opportunity to connect

00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:15.370
through a familiar
comforting routine.

00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:19.560
As you can see from the happy and
engaged faces of these children,

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:23.920
this dad has indeed instilled
a love of reading in his kids.

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:27.580
United Through Reading
was the first non-profit

00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:29.630 position:56%
to promote the read aloud experience

00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:31.840
to bring separated
families together.

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:36.900
And so from nearly 200
locations on land and at sea,

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:39.030
United Through Reading
offers service men

00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:43.280
and women the opportunity to be
video recorded reading a story book

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:47.080
and sending those with the
books home to their children.

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:50.160
Again, it's simple
to profound effect.

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:53.000
And the experience of
reading together erases

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.480
and eases the anxieties
of separation

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:59.210
and helps family members
stay connected.

00:29:59.210 --> 00:30:04.710
The enduring value is this -- the
stories read by far away parents

00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:07.190 position:56%
to children at home nurture literacy

00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:09.960
in this very special group
of vulnerable children.

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:13.590 position:56%
Just as you can see, this little guy
trying to crawl right into the TV.

00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:16.970
Daddy is in that room
just as sure as shooting.

00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:21.300
For more than 25 years, this
concept has proven itself

00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:22.700
over and over again.

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:25.110
Deployed military parents
are reading to their children

00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:30.220
from outposts in Afghanistan,
Djibouti, Bahrain, Ethiopia,

00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:34.660
on U.S. naval ships, on coast
guard cutters, in base libraries,

00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:39.380
and military medical
centers, and in 70 USOs.

00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:43.110 position:56%
Nearly two million mothers, fathers,
and children who are separated

00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:48.750
by oceans, deserts, and time
zones have sustained family bonds

00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:52.670
and nurtured young readers through
the quintessential tradition

00:30:52.670 --> 00:30:55.550
of reading stories together.

00:30:55.550 --> 00:30:57.240
And so here's how we do it.

00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:59.720
The service member reads a
book to their child on video

00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:01.930
and sends the video
home with the book.

00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:06.020
The child at home watches the
UTR video and follows along.

00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:09.640
The caregiver at home, whether
it's mom or grandma or auntie,

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:13.590
captures the child's
reaction -- watching --

00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:17.330
and then we send that
picture or that video back

00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:18.630
to the service member

00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:21.690
and the service members morale
is boosted by the feedback.

00:31:21.690 --> 00:31:24.640
And he or she is encouraged
to read again.

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:29.970
And so it's a great circle of
communication that keeps it going.

00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:35.100 position:56%
The book itself is a very component
of United Through Reading's program.

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:38.870 position:56%
Research shows that there's a direct
correlation between the amount

00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:42.090
of books children own
and their reading levels.

00:31:42.090 --> 00:31:45.410
Our hope is that participation in
United Through Reading will help

00:31:45.410 --> 00:31:48.350
to build children's
personal home libraries.

00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:51.140
Each quarter, we partner
with our good friends --

00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:54.350
and this year's David M.
Rubenstein's prize winner,

00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:58.150
First Book -- to select
titles for use in our program.

00:31:58.150 --> 00:32:02.140
So thanks to Kyle Zimmer
and her amazing team,

00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:04.270
these books are then
shipped to United

00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:07.380
Through Reading program
locations around the world.

00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:12.020
We collaborate to select titles
that speak to special days that mom

00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:14.320
or dad is going to
miss during deployment

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:16.330
such as, "Look Out, Kindergarten.

00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:17.930
Here I come."

00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:19.970
Or "Arthur's Loose Tooth."

00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:23.760
As well as those beloved bedtime
classics that we've all read,

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:26.670
"Goodnight, Moon," and
"Guess How Much I Love You."

00:32:26.670 --> 00:32:28.620
There's something incredibly
powerful

00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:32.530
about a child holding the
same book in his hands

00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:37.100
that his mama held reading it to
him from halfway around the world.

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:40.030
And we hear stories all the time
from families who has told us

00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:42.960
that their kiddos take their
United Through Reading books

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:47.970
with them everywhere as a
touchstone to their faraway hero.

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:52.080
The obvious question
is, "Why not skype?"

00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:53.380
And that's a good question.

00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:56.640
And we want families to Skype; and
we want them to Facebook; and email

00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:59.130
and write and communicate
through any means available.

00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:02.710
But there are some
important reasons why United

00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:05.130
Through Reading can be
the essential supplement

00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:07.020
to those family communications.

00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:09.430
For example, time differences.

00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:12.620
When it's naptime in Fort
Campbell, Kentucky, it's the middle

00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:14.930
of the night in Afghanistan.

00:33:14.930 --> 00:33:17.350
Time zones and operational demands

00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:19.290
of our service members
don't often line

00:33:19.290 --> 00:33:22.020
up for service members
and their families.

00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:25.820
And even when they do, sometimes
the stars don't quite align.

00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:30.750
Where service members are
deploying, training, working,

00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:32.820
that precious bandwidth
-- when it's available --

00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:36.150
is most often needed for
operational activities.

00:33:36.150 --> 00:33:40.200
And so unreliable connections can
mean disappointing conversations

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:42.270
and that's when the
bandwidth is there.

00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:44.410
Often, it's simply not.

00:33:44.410 --> 00:33:48.810
With United Through Reading videos,
parents and children alike can rely

00:33:48.810 --> 00:33:52.040
on availability and repeatability.

00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:54.180
We call it, "Mommy
and Daddy on-demand."

00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:56.340
[ Laughter ]

00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:59.310
Anyone who has ever read to a
child knows that children love

00:33:59.310 --> 00:34:03.480
to hear the same story over and
over and over and over again.

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:07.010
And we know that this
repetition may drive us crazy.

00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:11.370
But it's a wonderful way to build
vocabulary and word recognition.

00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:13.300
And we have loads of proof too.

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:17.340
For example, General and Mrs.
Odierno's five-year-old grandson

00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:20.550
watched his first video 17 times.

00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:21.850
The first day.

00:34:21.850 --> 00:34:23.150
[ Laughter ]

00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:25.980
And the reason we know that is
because his parents were so amazed

00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:29.170
that they started counting.

00:34:29.170 --> 00:34:31.750
I'm pleased to tell you that
our beneficiaries report

00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:33.630
that United Through Reading works.

00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:35.850
Program surveys tell
us that 81 percent

00:34:35.850 --> 00:34:38.200
of our participants
reported decrease

00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:40.070
in their children's anxiety.

00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:43.980
Eighty-eight percent report
an increase in connectedness.

00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:46.280
Ninety percent of participants
report

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:49.370
that participation
reduces their own stress.

00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:52.170
And that's really important
and very encouraging

00:34:52.170 --> 00:34:55.280
because while children were
the initial focus of United

00:34:55.280 --> 00:35:00.760 position:56%
Through Reading, the adult service
member is a key beneficiary as well.

00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:04.220
And that's great news in light
of the mental health issues

00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:06.640
that our service members
are coming home with.

00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:11.200
Seventy-eight percent of
participants report increases

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:13.690
in their child's interest
in reading and book.

00:35:13.690 --> 00:35:17.790
And like General and Mrs. Odierno's
grandchild, we know that more

00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:21.830
than 80 percent of the
recordings are watched every day

00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:23.130
or several times a day.

00:35:23.130 --> 00:35:25.010
And it's not unusual for children

00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:30.480
to watch a recorded story 250 times
during a ten-month deployment.

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:32.510
So do the math with me.

00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:37.690
That means that 2500 recordings
enjoyed by two eager children

00:35:37.690 --> 00:35:42.970
in a home amounts to 1 million
bedtime stories in a year.

00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:46.880 position:56%
As I'm sure you know, we believe
that parents have a fundamental role

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:50.790 position:56%
as children's first teachers to help
them acquire pre-literacy skills.

00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:55.410
And in June of 2014, the American
Academy of Pediatrics recommended

00:35:55.410 --> 00:35:59.130 position:56%
that pediatricians tell parents
that they should be reading together

00:35:59.130 --> 00:36:02.310
as a daily fun family
activity from infancy.

00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:04.530
We absolutely agree.

00:36:04.530 --> 00:36:06.690
United Through Reading has
equipped military parents

00:36:06.690 --> 00:36:09.760
to that for more than 25 years.

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:13.030
And plus, reading to
children enhances vocabulary

00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:15.270
and other communication skills.

00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:19.300
We recognize that story time forms
a critical bond between parents

00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:22.820
and child and it provides
moments to share things

00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:27.320
that might be left unsaid in the
chaos of a normal family day.

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:32.110
Especially when that normal family
day takes place over the course

00:36:32.110 --> 00:36:36.080
of a ten-month deployment
and families are separated

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:38.560
by oceans and continents.

00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:42.430
United Through Reading trains
volunteers to oversee each site

00:36:42.430 --> 00:36:45.300
and how to engage children
and draw them into stories.

00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:48.370
And as I mentioned, each site
has a selection of high quality,

00:36:48.370 --> 00:36:52.870
age appropriate books that
service members can read.

00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:56.360
We also celebrate certain
events throughout the years.

00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:59.210
In this particular picture,
these service members are

00:36:59.210 --> 00:37:03.870
from Task Force Sinai, and they
are celebrating Dr. Seuss' birthday

00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:06.170
on Read Across America Day.

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:12.570 position:56%
All of these adds up to a profoundly
powerful connection being made

00:37:12.570 --> 00:37:18.860
by military families who are facing
seemingly insurmountable odds.

00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:21.700
Parents maintain their vital
roles as first teachers.

00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:24.640
They build early literacy
skills in their children.

&gt;&gt; My dad is on a ship.

00:37:46.850 --> 00:37:49.640
He's on a ship because
he's on deployment.

00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:57.410

then when my daddy gets home,

something that we miss.

Daily stuff.

00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:07.970 position:56%
I mean, big things are hard too, you
know, not being here for holidays

00:38:07.970 --> 00:38:09.890
or birthdays, anniversaries,
things like that.

00:38:09.890 --> 00:38:13.730
Those are though because it's a
special day that he is missing but,

00:38:13.730 --> 00:38:16.100
you know, for us, it's
the everyday --

00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:18.200
just every day moments
that we miss out on.

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:21.920
Since reading is such a big part
of our routine, and you know,

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:24.730 position:56%
he'll sit there and they'll surround
him when he's sitting on the bed

00:38:24.730 --> 00:38:26.030
and he'll read them a story.

00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:27.400
And like they said,
he gets animated.

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:32.410
So for him to be on a DVD that
they can see and hear him,

00:38:32.410 --> 00:38:33.710 position:56%

00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:37.010
over the moon to have
that connection.

00:38:37.010 --> 00:38:38.620
Because it is a part of our routine

00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:41.680
so he will still be a visible
part of our routing then.

00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:45.920

sitting in front of us.

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:50.830

kind of, sad, but not really

00:38:50.830 --> 00:38:52.130

00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:29.280
It gives them an opportunity
to share a special moment

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:30.580
with the person that they love.

00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:35.080

opportunity to dare to dream.

00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:37.140
[ Music ]

00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:43.030
Now that we have this
partnership with First Book,

00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:50.300
we're able to introduce families
to opportunities and resources.

00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:51.600
This is how we change
the fabric of community.

00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:52.900
One family.

00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:54.200
One parent.

00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:55.500
One father.

00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:57.300
One child at a time.

00:43:57.300 --> 00:44:03.170

00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:06.850
&gt;&gt; Sally Zoll: So with heroes
like that, I can, you know,

00:44:06.850 --> 00:44:10.100
you can easily see how we're
inspired every single day

00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:12.120
at First Book.

00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:15.310
And I realize at a
beautiful event like this --

00:44:15.310 --> 00:44:19.190
at one of my favorite buildings
in all of Washington --

00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:22.560
that I'm supposed to be
inspiring and hopeful.

00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:27.600
But I have to be honest with you
and, you know, it's difficult.

00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:29.980 position:56%
I've been doing this job and working

00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:32.720
in this field for more
than 25 years.

00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:37.020
And I think that we have to
look each other in the eye

00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:40.770
and recognize one really
critical fact.

00:44:40.770 --> 00:44:43.680
Our system is broken.

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:47.890
We're standing in one of the
wealthiest countries in the world.

00:44:47.890 --> 00:44:53.310
A country that is founded
on democracy and equality.

00:44:53.310 --> 00:44:59.380
And frankly, we're falling
far, far short of that promise.

00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:02.600
At First Book, that
keeps us up at night.

00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:07.270
And frankly, it ought to
keep all of us up at night.

00:45:07.270 --> 00:45:11.160
And I just want to share with you
-- at the risk of making this sound

00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:14.080
like a gigantic group
therapy session --

00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:16.380
I want to share with you
a couple of the things

00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:19.120
that are keeping me awake.

00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:23.620
The first thing is the
sheer size of the problem.

00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:30.210
Our current educational crisis
is so vast, and our solutions,

00:45:30.210 --> 00:45:33.740
they have to be equal
to that challenge.

00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:37.510
This last year, we
crossed a threshold --

00:45:37.510 --> 00:45:43.110
51 percent of kids in the United
States, in public schools --

00:45:43.110 --> 00:45:48.040
51 percent are from
low income families.

00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:54.270
The link between poverty and low
literacy is very well established.

00:45:54.270 --> 00:45:58.510
It shouldn't surprise any
of us to see that 80 percent

00:45:58.510 --> 00:46:04.370
of low income fourth graders are
not reading at proficient levels.

00:46:04.370 --> 00:46:09.800
And another way to say 80
percent is to say, almost none.

00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:14.330
Almost none of those children
are confident readers.

00:46:14.330 --> 00:46:17.940
And so to shift a trend
of that size,

00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:21.750
we've got to build
large scale solutions.

00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:27.350
Solutions that will really produce
the dramatic results that we need.

00:46:27.350 --> 00:46:30.400
And that is what First
Book is all about.

00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:34.190
We have built dynamic models
that have delivered now more

00:46:34.190 --> 00:46:41.010
than 140 million books, and a large
and growing list of resources.

00:46:41.010 --> 00:46:42.310
And we're proud of that.

00:46:42.310 --> 00:46:44.400
And we're happy with that.

00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:48.720
But we know every day, that
we have to grow faster.

00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:50.810
That we have to do more.

00:46:50.810 --> 00:46:55.630
And we have to do it at a rate
that's unprecedented if we're going

00:46:55.630 --> 00:46:59.420
to get ahead of the
wave that we see coming.

00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:04.200
The second thing that keeps
me awake at night is this.

00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:06.630
We need Gutenberg 2.0.

00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:08.920
And we need it now.

00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:11.940
We know from history
what access does

00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:15.230
to build an educated population.

00:47:15.230 --> 00:47:17.650
Gutenberg taught us that.

00:47:17.650 --> 00:47:19.550
The mass publishing industry

00:47:19.550 --> 00:47:26.340 position:56%
in the United States really ran full
throttle in about the mid-1800s.

00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:31.990
So it shouldn't surprise any
of us that after 150 years,

00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:36.350
that industry needs a major reset.

00:47:36.350 --> 00:47:39.340
The average price of
a premium picture book

00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:44.470
in the United States today is $18.

00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:50.950
$18 is a price point that excludes
everyone but the wealthiest five

00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:55.000
or maybe 10 percent of
the U.S. population.

00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:00.020
The publishers are not to blame
in this and anyone who works

00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:04.710
with publishers knows that they
are heart and soul in this battle.

00:48:04.710 --> 00:48:06.460
And they worked with us.

00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:11.200
They worked with many, many
other terrific organizations.

00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:15.090
But we also know -- all
of us in this room know --

00:48:15.090 --> 00:48:21.700
that publishing really holds the
intellectual life of our country.

00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:24.730
And it can't be designed in a way

00:48:24.730 --> 00:48:28.190
that it's limited to
the top five percent.

00:48:28.190 --> 00:48:33.630
At First Book, we're building
a brand new market at the base

00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:39.640
of the economic pyramid for books
and for educational resources.

00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:44.760
Our market has grown more
than 30 percent every year.

00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:47.510
But we have to expand those efforts

00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:51.160
to reach every single
child in poverty.

00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:55.340
To sustain and strengthen the
current publishing industry.

00:48:55.340 --> 00:48:59.270
And most importantly, to
make good on the promise

00:48:59.270 --> 00:49:03.700
of equal education for
every single child.

00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:08.410
The third thing that keeps
me awake is that books need

00:49:08.410 --> 00:49:12.660
to be both affordable and relevant.

00:49:12.660 --> 00:49:15.600
People have been citing
a lack of relevancy.

00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:20.170
A lack of cultural diversity in
children's books for decades.

00:49:20.170 --> 00:49:25.420
And yet, in the last evaluation
by the University of Wisconsin,

00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:30.120
the percentage of non-white
children's authors is

00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:32.860
about eight percent.

00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:38.730
So there are wonderful books
being written by a huge range

00:49:38.730 --> 00:49:42.860
of wonderful authors,
but it's not enough.

00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:45.010
We're not moving it fast enough.

00:49:45.010 --> 00:49:46.960
And we're not even close.

00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:52.260
First Book's own research has
shown that over 90 percent

00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:56.150
of the educators we
serve have told us

00:49:56.150 --> 00:50:00.290
that their kids would be
more enthusiastic readers

00:50:00.290 --> 00:50:04.460
if the books reflected
their own lives.

00:50:04.460 --> 00:50:07.970
We've got to listen to
a voice that strong.

00:50:07.970 --> 00:50:11.140
We've got to listen
and we've got to act.

00:50:11.140 --> 00:50:15.990
Because between the high price of
books and the lack of relevancy,

00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:18.580
we're facing a really chasm.

00:50:18.580 --> 00:50:22.940
First Book has launched
something called Stories for All.

00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:25.780
And it's a program
that's revolutionary

00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:27.310
because it's market driven.

00:50:27.310 --> 00:50:32.720
And it is addressing this need but
we've got to amplify the results.

00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:35.490
We've got to move faster.

00:50:35.490 --> 00:50:40.860
Now, I can't close without
giving you some good news, right?

00:50:40.860 --> 00:50:44.940
Come on. We do know what works.

00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:46.520
We know what works.

00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:48.260
It's books.

00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:52.870
We hear from our network all of
the time, and we receive letters --

00:50:52.870 --> 00:50:56.490
like one recently I
want to quote for you.

00:50:56.490 --> 00:50:59.010
"Thanks to First Book,
over the summer,

00:50:59.010 --> 00:51:02.690
our students were able
to pick out new books.

00:51:02.690 --> 00:51:04.840
The results were phenomenal.

00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:10.850
Instead of falling behind, 95
percent of our readers maintained

00:51:10.850 --> 00:51:16.060
or improved their developmental
reading assessment scores.

00:51:16.060 --> 00:51:17.360
Ninety-five percent.

00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:18.660
I'll take that.

00:51:18.660 --> 00:51:19.960
I'll take that.

00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:23.230
We know that providing
great books and resources

00:51:23.230 --> 00:51:25.930
to heroic educators works.

00:51:25.930 --> 00:51:29.340
And now, our task is
to turn the volume up.

00:51:29.340 --> 00:51:34.830
And fast! If we can scale our
work over the next five years,

00:51:34.830 --> 00:51:38.430 position:56%
we will reach one million educators.

00:51:38.430 --> 00:51:43.040
And that translates roughly
into about 25 million children.

00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:48.540
Then, and only then,
can we sleep a little.

00:51:48.540 --> 00:51:50.800
Maybe a nap.

00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:55.800 position:56%
With the thought that every child
in this country has the equal chance

00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:59.200
to build their lives,
to raise their families,

00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:03.110
to contribute to their
community, and to their nation.

00:52:03.110 --> 00:52:06.940
And here is the most hopeful
thing, we can do this.

00:52:06.940 --> 00:52:09.160
We can do this together.

your help already.

00:52:11.330 --> 00:52:13.380
And so grateful for
this terrific day.

work that all of these groups do.

00:52:38.850 --> 00:52:43.430
And clearly, they are very, very
deserving of these Literacy Awards.

So why don't we start

00:53:10.340 --> 00:53:12.520
by where are you original from?

00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:14.400
&gt;&gt; Kyle Zimmer: I'm
from Southeastern Ohio.

00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:15.700
Saintsville.

00:53:15.700 --> 00:53:17.000
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay.

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:18.300
And so you went to college where?

00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:20.600
&gt;&gt; Kyle Zimmer: I went to
the University of Iowa.

00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:21.900
I know.

00:53:21.900 --> 00:53:23.200
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
What happened to Ohio?

00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:24.610
&gt;&gt; Kyle Zimmer: I don't have
a great explanation for that.

00:53:24.610 --> 00:53:26.270
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
So you went to Iowa.

00:53:26.270 --> 00:53:27.570
What did you major in?

00:53:27.570 --> 00:53:28.870
I assume not --

00:53:28.870 --> 00:53:30.170
&gt;&gt; Kyle Zimmer: English
and writing, actually.

00:53:30.170 --> 00:53:32.900
It was one of their
great departments.

00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:35.090
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So when you
graduated, then what did you do?

00:53:35.090 --> 00:53:38.150
&gt;&gt; Kyle Zimmer: I went to law
school here at GW, actually.

00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:40.080

&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay.

00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:45.280
So if you graduate from law
school, your family said, Okay.

00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:46.580
You're now going to be a
great corporate lawyer.

00:53:46.580 --> 00:53:47.880
You're going to make lots of money.

00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:49.400
What went wrong?

[ Laughter ]

00:53:51.610 --> 00:53:55.480

family was always dedicated,

00:53:55.480 --> 00:53:58.340
my family was always
dedicated to education.

00:53:58.340 --> 00:54:02.900
It made a profound
difference in our lives as --

00:54:02.900 --> 00:54:06.620
my brother's and sister's --
that as part of the GI Bill,

00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:09.460
my father had been
able to go to college.

00:54:09.460 --> 00:54:13.450
And that wouldn't have happened but
for that governmental intervention.

00:54:13.450 --> 00:54:15.740
And so they believed deeply in that

00:54:15.740 --> 00:54:19.480
and they were also very
socially motivated.

00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:23.530
So they actually -- I went
and practiced law for a while

00:54:23.530 --> 00:54:27.230
and then I saved my
soul by leaving there.

00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:28.700
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: And
where did you practice law?

00:54:28.700 --> 00:54:30.370
&gt;&gt; Kyle Zimmer: I practiced
here in Washington.

00:54:30.370 --> 00:54:31.670
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: At a law firm?

00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:32.970
&gt;&gt; Kyle Zimmer: At a law firm.

00:54:32.970 --> 00:54:34.740 position:56%
Anderson, Hibey, Nauheim, and Blair.

00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:36.040
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay.

00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:37.340
And you were doing Indian law or --

00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:38.780
&gt;&gt; Kyle Zimmer: I did some --

00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:44.530
represented the Navajo nation in
partnership with Peter Gold here

00:54:44.530 --> 00:54:47.300
who co-founded First Book with me.

00:54:47.300 --> 00:54:51.990
And a huge range of
corporate clients.

00:54:51.990 --> 00:54:53.830
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay, so
one day, and epiphany happens.

00:54:53.830 --> 00:54:56.110
You say, "I don't really
want to do this for a living.

00:54:56.110 --> 00:54:57.620
I want to do something else.

00:54:57.620 --> 00:54:59.210
And I want to create First Book."

00:54:59.210 --> 00:55:00.510
Is that what happened?

00:55:00.510 --> 00:55:01.810
Or how did it come about?

00:55:01.810 --> 00:55:03.110
&gt;&gt; Kyle Zimmer: You know,
how it came about is --

00:55:03.110 --> 00:55:07.000
it was right in the middle of
the crack epidemic in Washington,

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:12.720
D.C. and I was very aware that a
town that I loved was under siege.

00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:17.480
And so I began tutoring at
a little soup kitchen right

00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:19.970
down the road here
called Martha's Table.

00:55:19.970 --> 00:55:21.270
Now it's grown.

00:55:21.270 --> 00:55:22.720
Everybody knows Martha's Table.

00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:27.050
And so I -- and when I
went there, every night,

00:55:27.050 --> 00:55:30.960
the place would be
filled with 50 or 60 kids

00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:33.270
that were all doing
exactly the right thing.

00:55:33.270 --> 00:55:36.100
They were coming in off
of dangerous streets.

00:55:36.100 --> 00:55:38.620
They were looking for
adult intervention.

00:55:38.620 --> 00:55:39.920
And we didn't really --

00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:43.350
at that point in Martha's
Tables development --

00:55:43.350 --> 00:55:45.720
we didn't have a lot to offer them.

00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:49.410
And so I kept thinking, you
know, what would this look like?

00:55:49.410 --> 00:55:51.190
We could start reading to them.

00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:52.490
We need books.

00:55:52.490 --> 00:55:55.110
We need -- and that began
the process of looking

00:55:55.110 --> 00:55:56.940
at other neighborhood groups.

00:55:56.940 --> 00:56:01.980 position:56%
Going into some of the schools and
seeing what was not available there.

00:56:01.980 --> 00:56:05.730
And Peter and I started
putting our thoughts together.

00:56:05.730 --> 00:56:08.810
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So one day,
you went into your colleagues

00:56:08.810 --> 00:56:10.750
in the law firm and said,
"I'm just going to just quit

00:56:10.750 --> 00:56:13.180
and go into literacy world?"

00:56:13.180 --> 00:56:14.480
Is that what you said?

00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:15.780
&gt;&gt; Kyle Zimmer: It
was sort of like that.

00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:18.010
I mean, we always had a
sense we weren't going

00:56:18.010 --> 00:56:20.400
to build a traditional non-profit.

00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:25.260
And so it has a lot more
business modeling behind it.

00:56:25.260 --> 00:56:26.560
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay.

00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:28.780
So when you told your family you
were going to give up your practice

00:56:28.780 --> 00:56:30.180
of law, what did they say?

00:56:30.180 --> 00:56:34.680
&gt;&gt; Kyle Zimmer: Well, mostly
they were pretty proud.

00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:36.900
I think they were pretty
happy that I was willing

00:56:36.900 --> 00:56:39.340
to roll my sleeves up and jump in.

00:56:39.340 --> 00:56:44.060
And, you know, I've got a proud
tradition -- my sister is here --

00:56:44.060 --> 00:56:48.350
who also is a lawyer who
works in the social sector.

00:56:48.350 --> 00:56:51.170
So she beat down the
bushes in front of me

00:56:51.170 --> 00:56:53.300
and I was able to walk the path.

00:56:53.300 --> 00:56:55.560
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: What year
was it that you started actually?

00:56:55.560 --> 00:56:56.860
&gt;&gt; Kyle Zimmer: 1992.

00:56:56.860 --> 00:56:59.440
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay, and so
where did you get your first money?

00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:03.540
&gt;&gt; Kyle Zimmer: We got our first
check from Reading is Fundamental.

00:57:03.540 --> 00:57:05.940 position:56%
They gave us a little starter grant.

00:57:05.940 --> 00:57:11.300
And then we got a larger
investment from Share Our Strength.

00:57:11.300 --> 00:57:13.390
The hunger relief organization.

00:57:13.390 --> 00:57:15.890
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So how many
people did you initially have

00:57:15.890 --> 00:57:17.190
in your organization?

00:57:17.190 --> 00:57:18.490
You and...

00:57:18.490 --> 00:57:19.790
&gt;&gt; Kyle Zimmer: There were --

00:57:19.790 --> 00:57:23.930
we ran it on a volunteer
basis for a little while.

00:57:23.930 --> 00:57:26.140
Maybe a year and a half,
and then we hired a couple

00:57:26.140 --> 00:57:27.440
of young people to come in.

00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:29.490
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: How
many people do you have now?

00:57:29.490 --> 00:57:32.190
&gt;&gt; Kyle Zimmer: I think
just over 80.

00:57:32.190 --> 00:57:33.490
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay.

00:57:33.490 --> 00:57:34.970
And not on a volunteer basis?

00:57:34.970 --> 00:57:36.270
&gt;&gt; Kyle Zimmer: No, indeed.

00:57:36.270 --> 00:57:37.570
No.

00:57:37.570 --> 00:57:38.870
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So you
have 80 people and now --

00:57:38.870 --> 00:57:41.870
how many books have you actually
purchased -- would you say --

00:57:41.870 --> 00:57:43.300
over the years that
you've been doing this?

00:57:43.300 --> 00:57:47.290
&gt;&gt; Kyle Zimmer: Well, we've given
away about 140 million books.

00:57:47.290 --> 00:57:53.020
And last year, we hit about
15 million books in that year.

00:57:53.020 --> 00:57:56.260
It's a wonderful hockey
stick -- the growth.

00:57:56.260 --> 00:57:57.560
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay.

00:57:57.560 --> 00:57:58.860
And you do it in the
United States principally?

00:57:58.860 --> 00:58:00.160
&gt;&gt; Kyle Zimmer: Principally,

00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:02.600
although we have expanded
into Canada.

00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:05.740
And so we have an office
just outside of Toronto

00:58:05.740 --> 00:58:08.350
and we've been doing that
for three or four years.

00:58:08.350 --> 00:58:10.900 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So now you have
several different programs but one

00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:14.390
of them is you buy books,
and then you distribute them.

00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:15.690
&gt;&gt; Kyle Zimmer: Yup.

00:58:15.690 --> 00:58:16.990
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
You have another program

00:58:16.990 --> 00:58:19.410
where people can go online
and buy books at a discount?

00:58:19.410 --> 00:58:20.710
&gt;&gt; Kyle Zimmer: Right.

00:58:20.710 --> 00:58:22.010
It's two jet engines.

00:58:22.010 --> 00:58:24.430
One is called the First
Book National Book bank.

00:58:24.430 --> 00:58:27.220
And that was the model we designed.

00:58:27.220 --> 00:58:28.520
That's the older of the two.

00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:33.190
And we designed that on the
understand of the book industry.

00:58:33.190 --> 00:58:36.100
And how because it's a
consignment industry,

00:58:36.100 --> 00:58:39.380
there's a tremendous
backflow of inventory.

00:58:39.380 --> 00:58:43.630
And so we went to the
publishers and we said,

00:58:43.630 --> 00:58:45.430
"Do you give those books away?"

00:58:45.430 --> 00:58:46.730
And they did what they could.

00:58:46.730 --> 00:58:49.370
But it's a very expensive
thing to manage.

00:58:49.370 --> 00:58:54.290
So we stepped into that space and
built the first system of its kind

00:58:54.290 --> 00:58:59.270
that now manages the lion's
share of contributed books

00:58:59.270 --> 00:59:00.570
from the publishing industry.

00:59:00.570 --> 00:59:01.870
That's the Book bank.

00:59:01.870 --> 00:59:03.220
And then there's the Marketplace.

00:59:03.220 --> 00:59:04.820
And these are very separate.

00:59:04.820 --> 00:59:10.210
The marketplace is when we buy
the inventory from the publishers.

00:59:10.210 --> 00:59:14.550
What we said to the publishers
in that instance is, "Look,

00:59:14.550 --> 00:59:17.210
you really are constrained --

00:59:17.210 --> 00:59:19.570
your market, the way it's
currently designed --

00:59:19.570 --> 00:59:24.300
the market for books is
constrained to the top veneer

00:59:24.300 --> 00:59:26.810
of socio-economic strata.

00:59:26.810 --> 00:59:29.360
And what we will do is we'll go out

00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:32.860
and aggregate the base
of the pyramid.

00:59:32.860 --> 00:59:35.500
So we will pay for aggregation.

00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:41.540
We will buy on a non-consignment,
a non-returnable basis.

00:59:41.540 --> 00:59:44.360
And that was music to
their ears of course.

00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:50.560
And then, we also said that they
wouldn't have to advertise to us.

00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:54.830
So we basically took away
all the risk from the market.

00:59:54.830 --> 00:59:57.700
And we took away a lot of the cost.

00:59:57.700 --> 01:00:01.870
And we said we expect your
prices to reflect the fact

01:00:01.870 --> 01:00:06.390
that we're building a new market
and that none of this risk is --

01:00:06.390 --> 01:00:08.940
or expenses any longer
on your plate.

01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:10.940
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So are
you bigger now in Washington

01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:13.660
than other cities or is
-- you're everywhere?

01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:17.590
&gt;&gt; Kyle Zimmer: Nope, our network
-- we have an online system where,

01:00:17.590 --> 01:00:20.860
literally, anyone serving
children in need --

01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:26.300
zero to 18 years of age --
can sign up with us for free.

01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:31.460
Title I classrooms and schools,
anybody certain, you know,

01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:37.170
Head Starts, health care centers,
libraries, literally any place.

01:00:37.170 --> 01:00:41.150
They come on and they give us
their bonafide [inaudible] online.

01:00:41.150 --> 01:00:43.600
And that system is free.

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:47.600
And once they're in --
once we've certified them,

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:51.440
then they can have access to
both the book bank inventory --

01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:53.490
where they only pay for shipping --

01:00:53.490 --> 01:00:57.570
and the marketplace inventory
where the average price

01:00:57.570 --> 01:01:03.540
of a brand new paperback book,
including shipping, is $2.85.

01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:06.060
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So
what ages do you focus on?

01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:09.310
&gt;&gt; Kyle Zimmer: Well, we
cover zero to eighteen.

01:01:09.310 --> 01:01:10.910
We're all the way up.

01:01:10.910 --> 01:01:13.650
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: And what about
adults who can't afford books?

01:01:13.650 --> 01:01:15.500
Have you gone into that area yet?

01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:16.800
&gt;&gt; Kyle Zimmer: Well, we haven't.

01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:19.030
By the time, I mean,
we haven't overtly.

01:01:19.030 --> 01:01:21.490
By the time -- there are
a bunch of programs though

01:01:21.490 --> 01:01:27.940
where new moms will come
into the program to get books

01:01:27.940 --> 01:01:31.310
through their system to
read with their child.

01:01:31.310 --> 01:01:35.700
We also have a lot of books
that we specifically look

01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:42.600
for that are very high interest
in low level vocabulary to begin

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:48.310 position:56%
to bring the older population -- the
older readers -- into the system.

01:01:48.310 --> 01:01:50.740
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So somebody
gets a book from your system.

01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:53.250
A child gets two or three
books and you have them,

01:01:53.250 --> 01:01:54.550
what do they do typically

01:01:54.550 --> 01:01:57.350
when they're done reading
them 20 or 30 or 40 times.

01:01:57.350 --> 01:01:59.980
Do they pass them along
or do they hold them,

01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:01.860
put them in their library,
what do they do with them?

01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:04.050
&gt;&gt; Kyle Zimmer: It's every
story you can imagine.

01:02:04.050 --> 01:02:07.210
So, you know, there are some
schools, some classrooms

01:02:07.210 --> 01:02:09.420
that build classroom
libraries with them.

01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:16.780
There are some families that -- you
saw them on Sally's presentation,

01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:18.660
you know, family libraries.

01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:22.340
And we know how important
that is for reading skills.

01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:25.070 position:56%
We know that having a family library

01:02:25.070 --> 01:02:29.410
of even 20 books has
an extraordinary impact

01:02:29.410 --> 01:02:31.350
on the academic achievement.

01:02:31.350 --> 01:02:33.460
So some of them stay
home with the kids,

01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:36.770
some of them get traded
around from kid to kid.

01:02:36.770 --> 01:02:38.070
It depends on the program.

01:02:38.070 --> 01:02:39.370
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: And
is there a difference

01:02:39.370 --> 01:02:42.600 position:56%
between whether a child likes a book
with a hard back or a soft back?

01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:43.900
Does it make a difference?

01:02:43.900 --> 01:02:45.540
&gt;&gt; Kyle Zimmer: I don't think
it makes a difference at all.

01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:46.840
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Does
it make a difference --

01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:48.350
why do publishers still
publish a hard back?

01:02:48.350 --> 01:02:50.180
Because it's presumably
more expensive or --

01:02:50.180 --> 01:02:52.380
&gt;&gt; Kyle Zimmer: It's
very much more expansive.

01:02:52.380 --> 01:02:55.620
And I don't think it makes
a difference to the kid.

01:02:55.620 --> 01:02:58.600
I think that there are
a lot of reasons --

01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:01.590
people love the feeling
of hard back books.

01:03:01.590 --> 01:03:04.350
And it also, you know,
is a lovely thing

01:03:04.350 --> 01:03:06.240 position:56%
for a keepsake and things like that.

01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:09.140 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So a lot of
adults now are reading books online.

01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:10.440
&gt;&gt; Kyle Zimmer: Yup.

01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:11.740
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: And on
Kindles or other devices.

01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:13.050
Are children doing that yet?

01:03:13.050 --> 01:03:14.890
Do they have their own
kindles yet for children

01:03:14.890 --> 01:03:18.270
or they're still reading books
-- the kind of books you provide?

01:03:18.270 --> 01:03:20.220
&gt;&gt; Kyle Zimmer: Well, I don't think

01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:26.060 position:56%
that the digital content space has
taken off anywhere nearly as quickly

01:03:26.060 --> 01:03:28.840
as the industry thought it might.

01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:31.560
And it breaks down by age.

01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:37.180
Kids -- the older kids may not
have kindles but they certainly --

01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:42.560
there's a huge penetration of smart
phones and smart technology, right?

01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:48.940 position:56%
So those were actually working and
providing and increasing opportunity

01:03:48.940 --> 01:03:53.320
for digital content to
make that accessible

01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:54.990
through the First Book Marketplace.

01:03:54.990 --> 01:03:58.980
But littler kids, the
technology isn't really there.

01:03:58.980 --> 01:04:02.800
You know, because you
have to have a unit

01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:05.810
that is simultaneously
high quality enough --

01:04:05.810 --> 01:04:07.110
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Right.

01:04:07.110 --> 01:04:09.380
&gt;&gt; Kyle Zimmer: That it
can capture the artwork,

01:04:09.380 --> 01:04:12.040
and it can also have grape juice
spilled on it and be dropped

01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:13.340
down a flight of steps, right?

01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:14.640
And so --

01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:15.940
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
Who does a better job

01:04:15.940 --> 01:04:17.310
of preparing children to read?

01:04:17.310 --> 01:04:20.060
Fathers or mothers
when they're reading?

01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:21.770
&gt;&gt; Kyle Zimmer: Oh, man.

01:04:21.770 --> 01:04:23.070
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
When they're reading

01:04:23.070 --> 01:04:24.440
to their children, is
there a difference?

01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:25.890
&gt;&gt; Kyle Zimmer: No, there's not.

01:04:25.890 --> 01:04:28.280
You know, I think the --

01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:34.500
what we want is we want 24/7
surround sound for kids.

01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:35.920
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: And
if you don't have a parent,

01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:38.040
does it make a difference
for the child?

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:40.080
Or who typically reads to
the children if, let's say,

01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:42.400
they don't have a parent or
they're one parent families.

01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:44.000
Is it a big difference?

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.190
Do you see a big difference in
their literacy capabilities --

01:04:46.190 --> 01:04:48.450
there's a one parent family?

01:04:48.450 --> 01:04:52.960
&gt;&gt; Kyle Zimmer: I think poverty
is the main indicator on that.

01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:58.670
It's when you've got caring adults,
that's the most important thing.

01:04:58.670 --> 01:05:00.180
That's the most important thing.

01:05:00.180 --> 01:05:04.340 position:56%
And when they're reading in the life
of a child, that's a power tool.

01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:05.640
That's tremendous.

01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:11.100
I will tell you, quickly, that
I've seen just recently some

01:05:11.100 --> 01:05:15.520
extraordinary programs where
they are bringing older kids

01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:20.440
who are struggling with reading
themselves in to read and tutor

01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:23.480
with younger kids in
the same school.

01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:28.960
And the impact metrics
on that is breathtaking.

01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:30.740
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So I
suppose President Obama called you

01:05:30.740 --> 01:05:32.040
up and said, "I heard --

01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:33.340
&gt;&gt; Kyle Zimmer: He
does all the time.

01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:34.640
[ Laughter ]

01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:35.940
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: He'd
say you've done a great job.

01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:37.240
I've heard about this award.

01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:38.540
I've heard about the organization.

01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:40.500
I'll give you a 100
million dollars --

01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:42.850
okay, I'll give you a billion
dollars, what would you do

01:05:42.850 --> 01:05:44.700
to improve the literacy
in the United States

01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:46.180
with 100 million or
a billion dollars?

01:05:46.180 --> 01:05:47.480
What would you do with that?

01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:49.230
&gt;&gt; Kyle Zimmer: Well, the first
thing I would do is I'd make sure

01:05:49.230 --> 01:05:52.140
every teacher, every educator,

01:05:52.140 --> 01:05:57.120
every preschool setting had
every resource they need.

01:05:57.120 --> 01:06:00.310
Right now, what we
have is an army --

01:06:00.310 --> 01:06:02.450
forgive me for the
military reference --

01:06:02.450 --> 01:06:08.590 position:56%
but we have an army with no supply
-- with an inadequate supply system.

01:06:08.590 --> 01:06:12.810
And so I think that's the magic
of what first book is building.

01:06:12.810 --> 01:06:17.890
And with infinite funding
or nearly infinite funding,

01:06:17.890 --> 01:06:22.740
our ability to upgrade IT
systems, to market and make sure

01:06:22.740 --> 01:06:26.960
that every eligible
teacher is in the system

01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:28.800
and receiving the benefits --

01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:35.900
you can't imagine what pent
up heroes there are out there.

01:06:35.900 --> 01:06:40.170
Teachers go into teaching,
people are working at Head Start

01:06:40.170 --> 01:06:43.800
and they've all got ideas
about what they want to do

01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:45.510
with the kids in their program.

01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:50.950
And so when they get resources,
the lid blows off the place.

01:06:50.950 --> 01:06:52.250
It's really inspiring.

01:06:52.250 --> 01:06:53.550
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So have
you ever thought of going

01:06:53.550 --> 01:06:55.960
into public service -- a
different type of public service --

01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:59.190
and go into government and
changing public policies

01:06:59.190 --> 01:07:00.690
to make more along
the lines you like

01:07:00.690 --> 01:07:02.320
or is that not something
you want to do?

01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:04.350
&gt;&gt; Kyle Zimmer: Well,
I'd be very interested

01:07:04.350 --> 01:07:07.000
in being helpful in the that.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.470
I'm not sure that I
have the temperament

01:07:09.470 --> 01:07:13.130
for working on the inside.

01:07:13.130 --> 01:07:19.800
But I'm a terrific heckler and
I'd be very happy in that role.

01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:21.100
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
So what book do you --

01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:22.400
how many books do you read a year?

01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:23.700
Are you a big reader yourself?

01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:25.000
&gt;&gt; Kyle Zimmer: I'm
a pretty big reader.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:29.600
A lot of my -- I have a 16-year-old
son -- he's sitting right there --

01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:31.960
and I have a 12-year-old
son and a lot

01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:35.270
of the books I read are
books that they are reading.

01:07:35.270 --> 01:07:36.580 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: And are they --

01:07:36.580 --> 01:07:38.980
they have to be gifted
readers because of your job?

01:07:38.980 --> 01:07:40.280
&gt;&gt; Kyle Zimmer: It's
required by law.

01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:41.580
Yes.

01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:42.880
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay.

01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:45.680
And you like to read
fiction, non-fiction?

01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:49.210
&gt;&gt; Kyle Zimmer: I tend to love
fiction and historical fiction.

01:07:49.210 --> 01:07:50.510
Yeah.

01:07:50.510 --> 01:07:53.800
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: And today,
if you look back on your career --

01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:56.780
do you have any regrets in
leaving the practice of law?

01:07:56.780 --> 01:07:58.240
And you're very happy
with what you've done?

01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:00.700
If you could do it all over again,
what would you do differently?

01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:03.070
&gt;&gt; Kyle Zimmer: You know, I
don't have a single regret.

01:08:03.070 --> 01:08:05.370
I feel like the luckiest
person in the world.

01:08:05.370 --> 01:08:06.670
I really do.

01:08:06.670 --> 01:08:12.620 position:56%
Because I feel like I spent a number
of years in training as a lawyer.

01:08:12.620 --> 01:08:15.890
And then a number of years
working as a lawyer at the elbow

01:08:15.890 --> 01:08:22.540
of brilliantly talented lawyers
who were able to sharpen my skills

01:08:22.540 --> 01:08:27.350
and my analytical reasoning
and my business skills.

01:08:27.350 --> 01:08:34.940 position:56%
And I've been able to pivot and turn
and apply that to something that --

01:08:34.940 --> 01:08:38.180
it's tremendously meaningful to me.

01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:41.450
And I get to work with
extraordinary people.

01:08:41.450 --> 01:08:42.750
Some of whom are sitting here.

01:08:42.750 --> 01:08:45.100
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So would
you recommend to your children

01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:46.690
that they go to law school?

01:08:46.690 --> 01:08:49.080
&gt;&gt; Kyle Zimmer: Yeah,
actually, I would recommend it.

01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:50.380
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
But not practice law?

01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:51.680
&gt;&gt; Kyle Zimmer: I think it's --

01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:52.980
certainly not practi-,
no, I'm teasing.

01:08:52.980 --> 01:08:55.940
You know, I think it's
great training.

01:08:55.940 --> 01:09:04.420
I think it made me far more capable
in developing new business models.

01:09:04.420 --> 01:09:10.470
I think I don't hesitate to call
people when I need their skillset.

01:09:10.470 --> 01:09:13.040
And I think it helped a lot.

01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:14.920 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So where do you
think your organization will be 10

01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:16.390
years from today?

01:09:16.390 --> 01:09:17.690
&gt;&gt; Kyle Zimmer: Ten
years from today, well,

01:09:17.690 --> 01:09:20.270
we will certainly be global.

01:09:20.270 --> 01:09:22.300
We're already tiptoeing out.

01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:28.550
We've done major distributions in
India and several other countries.

01:09:28.550 --> 01:09:33.800
And I think we did distributions in
about 19 countries just last year.

01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:37.750
Just pilots to start getting a
flavor for what would be required.

01:09:37.750 --> 01:09:39.620
So definitely global.

01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:44.020
We already are expanding
into teacher training.

01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:47.090
To begin to elevate what
happens to those books

01:09:47.090 --> 01:09:49.050
when they hit the classrooms.

01:09:49.050 --> 01:09:55.340
And because we want to make sure
that every leverage point we have,

01:09:55.340 --> 01:09:58.850
that we really pull the
lever to elevate impact.

01:09:58.850 --> 01:10:02.410
So, I think, you know, and
then expanding also the kinds

01:10:02.410 --> 01:10:04.610
of products that we offer.

01:10:04.610 --> 01:10:08.290
Books will always be -- either
electronic or traditional --

01:10:08.290 --> 01:10:11.280
will always be the
heartbeat of the organization.

01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:14.580
But we've learned, because
we constantly are talking

01:10:14.580 --> 01:10:17.180
to this network that we've built,

01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:20.680
and they tell us kids
are coming hungry.

01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:22.700
Kids are not coming to school

01:10:22.700 --> 01:10:24.550
because they don't
have winter coats.

01:10:24.550 --> 01:10:29.840 position:56%
And so now we have this logistical
system, we can make coats available.

01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:33.050
We can start breaking
down those barriers too.

01:10:33.050 --> 01:10:34.860
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So
what is your budget now?

01:10:34.860 --> 01:10:39.870
&gt;&gt; Kyle Zimmer: Our budget, if you
include books and all, is over --

01:10:39.870 --> 01:10:42.870
just over 100 million a year.

01:10:42.870 --> 01:10:46.100
Our operating budget is
just over 20 million.

01:10:46.100 --> 01:10:49.380 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Where does that
money -- that 20 million comes from?

01:10:49.380 --> 01:10:54.200
&gt;&gt; Kyle Zimmer: It's about 45
percent of it is funds that we earn

01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:56.310
through the market
place and the book bank.

01:10:56.310 --> 01:10:59.140
So we're heading towards
self-sufficiency.

01:10:59.140 --> 01:11:02.070
In fact, we believe in the
next three or four years,

01:11:02.070 --> 01:11:04.550
we will be 100 percent self-funded.

01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:05.850
How about that?

01:11:05.850 --> 01:11:07.150
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Pretty good.

01:11:07.150 --> 01:11:09.640
&gt;&gt; Kyle Zimmer: But we also have
at this moment, great corporations

01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:12.520
who have stepped up to help
us and wonderful individuals.

01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:14.980
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So I've always
found a non-profit [inaudible]

01:11:14.980 --> 01:11:17.300
should never say you're going to be
self-sufficient because you'd be --

01:11:17.300 --> 01:11:18.600
hard to get the donors but --

01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:20.290
[ Laughter ]

01:11:20.290 --> 01:11:22.240
&gt;&gt; Kyle Zimmer: I didn't say that.

01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:25.080
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So when your
children were learning to read,

01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:27.520
and their teachers were
not doing as good a job

01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:28.920
as you thought they
maybe should have?

01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:30.220
What did you say to the teachers?

01:11:30.220 --> 01:11:31.610
Or you always thought the
teachers were doing a good job?

01:11:31.610 --> 01:11:33.900
&gt;&gt; Kyle Zimmer: I actually always
thought the teachers were doing a

01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:35.200
pretty good job.

01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:40.900
I mean, I think that what we did
at home was we just read a lot.

01:11:40.900 --> 01:11:47.950
And, I think, more important than
the curriculum, in a lot of ways,

01:11:47.950 --> 01:11:51.010
is having fun doing it
and making it something

01:11:51.010 --> 01:11:53.750
