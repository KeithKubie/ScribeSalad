MARTIN OMANDER: Welcome to
the "Root Access" show.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.100
My name is Martin Omander, and
I work in Google Developer

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.820
Relations with Startup
Outreach.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.000
In this show, we will discuss
common issues and problems

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.050
that startups have.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.580
And in this first episode, we'll
discuss getting a seed

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.340
round of funding.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.830
My guest today is Don Dodge,
also from Developer Relations.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.450
Don, would you tell us what
you do at Google?

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.890
DON DODGE: Yes.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.940
I'm a Developer Advocate
at Google.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.920
I work with startups and help
them be successful using

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.990
Google technologies
to build their

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.910
applications and their companies.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.830
There are about 200 of us that
do that, and I've been doing

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.820
it for about three years.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:51.790
MARTIN OMANDER: All right.

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.540
Don, I hear a lot of terms about
funding of startups--

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.730
angel round, seed rounds,
series A, series B.

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:00.780
What do they mean?

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.060
Could you lay them out for us in
the lifecycle of a startup?

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.390
DON DODGE: Sure.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.230
There's several levels.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.390
The first one is usually called
Friends and Family.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.820
And it's called Friends and
Family because that's where

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:13.620
you get the money.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.410
And it's typically $50,000,
maybe $100,000, that you would

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.110
get from your friends
or family members.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.400
And at that stage, you really
don't have a company.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.860
You have an idea that you want
to pursue, and maybe build

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.640
into a company.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.470
So after that stage, you get
to the Seed Round, which is

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.970
typically funded by angels.

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.170
So it's sometimes called
Seed Round, sometimes

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.870
called Angel Round.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.970
That round is typically between
$100,000 and maybe all

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.020
the way up to $800,000
or $1 million.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.450
Angels are executives from big
tech companies that have made

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:53.500
a lot of money.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.930
More typically, they're founders
of startups that have

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.270
sold their company and made a
lot of money, and are looking

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.900
to invest in young entrepreneurs
and new ideas

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.000
and new companies.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.590
The next level up after the
Angel Round or Seed Round is

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.920
the Series A. And it's called
Series A because that's the

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.350
first series of equity
capital.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.360
So it goes A, B, C, D in
the different rounds.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.970
Those are funded by venture
capitalists or VCs.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.900
And those rounds tend to be more
like $1 to $2 million of

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.050
capital raised, and it's for
equity in the company.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.050
So they're actually taking
stock in the company.

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.410
Whereas those previous rounds,
the Friends and Family or the

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.270
Angels, those tend to be what
are called convertible notes.

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.780
And they're called convertible
because they convert from a

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.280
note into the Series A equity
stock when that happens.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.360
So they're quite different,
and that's the normal

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.490
progression.

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:59.480
MARTIN OMANDER: All right.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.620
So let's focus on
the Seed Round.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.310
When a company gets to that
point, when they're starting

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.340
to look for seed capital,
have the founders quit

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.960
their day jobs yet?

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.020
Where is the company
at that point?

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.300
DON DODGE: Yeah.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.240
At the Friends and Family stage,
they probably haven't

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.240
quit their jobs yet.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.170
They're still working nights
and weekends to try to make

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.120
this happen.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.880
By the time you get to the Seed
Round or Angel Round, one

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.120
or two of them have quit their
jobs, and now they're focusing

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.940
full time on developing
this idea.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.540
But they don't have much
in the way of a team

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.090
or a product yet.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.750
So they might have one or two
founders, or one founder and a

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.760
contract coder or something
like that to do something.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.320
They have an idea.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.820
And hopefully, they have
something like a demo, or

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.550
something that you can look at
to understand what it is

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.220
they're going to build.

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.080
It's getting progressively more
and more difficult to

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.590
raise the money, and
the bar is raising.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.180
So you have to have, maybe, not
just a prototype, but a

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.690
working product with
some beta users

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.860
already to get that money.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.610
MARTIN OMANDER: So let's talk a
little bit more about that.

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:21.390
If you have a startup, and
you've gone through the

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.040
Friends and Family round.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.140
So you have your demo--

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.510
you're thinking it's time
for the Seed Round.

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.370
What is the checklist of things
you should have before

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.150
you go out and talk to angels?

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.280
DON DODGE: Well, you want to
be as far along as you can.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.200
And you want to take it as far
as you can before you raise

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.430
that first money.

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.830
Because the longer you wait, the
more that you have done,

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.020
the easier it is to raise money,
and the more money that

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.640
you can raise at a
higher valuation.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.750
That said, when angel investors
are looking at a

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.320
company, they want to see two
founders that are committed to

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.940
making it happen.

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.250
They want to see a business plan
that sort of explains the

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.400
idea and where it could go.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.850
So the investor wants to be able
to connect the dots from

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:13.870
where you are now to where
you'll be to have revenue and

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.180
maybe have 10,000 customers
or hundreds of

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.340
thousands in revenue.

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.580
So you don't have to have the
revenue or the customers, but

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.660
you need to have a plan
on how to get there.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:30.590
And in most social or
easy applications,

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.630
they want to see users.

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:36.340
So they'd like to see the
product, not in it's complete

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.810
state, but at least enough so
that you have some users that

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:44.030
are giving you feedback and what
they call social proof,

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:47.850
where, in a social application,
you have enough

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:51.320
users that you can say, OK,
I can understand how

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.110
people will use this.

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:54.080
MARTIN OMANDER: Right.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.090
So these private individuals,
rather than companies,

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.660
investing at this point,
what kind of companies

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.490
do they invest in?

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.090
What are they looking for?

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.110
DON DODGE: Well, angel investors
invest in people

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.970
they know, or businesses
that they understand.

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:18.470
So a lot of these investors
are from startups that

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:21.840
successfully sold their
companies, or they're from big

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.890
tech companies where they
made a lot of money.

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:29.640
So they tend to understand
software, technical, web,

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:35.960
social, maybe video or mobile
or that kind of thing.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:39.100
Investors will tend to invest
where they understand the

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.750
business, where they have
some experience, where

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:43.990
they can add value.

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:46.930
So they know people in the
industry that can help, or

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:50.660
they know companies that you
need to work with, or they

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.720
have experience in building the
companies, so they can add

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.360
value and help you build
your company.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.090
So angels tend to look for
those opportunities.

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:01.310
Or the flip side of that
is, they invest

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:02.540
in people they know.

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:06.190
So people that they've worked
with in the past, people who

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:10.160
have worked at startups
that they know.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.500
So those are the two things.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.820
They invest in people they know
or businesses that they

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:14.840
understand.

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:15.520
MARTIN OMANDER: I see.

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.200
Do you invest in startups?

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:17.980
DON DODGE: I do, yeah.

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:19.740
I've been doing it for
quite a while.

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:22.750
I'm in 25 companies now.

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:26.880
I just invested in the last
one just last week.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.260
And I tend to invest in
companies that are doing

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:35.710
mobile, social, location, indoor
kinds of things, some

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:37.030
e-commerce.

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:41.320
So it's areas that I've worked
in in the past, and sort of

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.390
businesses that I understand.

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:44.710
And I think that's
pretty typical

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:46.970
of most angel investors.

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:49.710
MARTIN OMANDER: How do startups
get in front of the

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:51.220
right angel investors?

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:56.370
It sounds like not any angel
is a fit for every startup.

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:57.760
DON DODGE: That's right.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:01.610
Well, it usually comes from a
couple of different sources.

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:05.160
One is the angel investor
already knows that person

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:09.380
because they worked with them at
a previous company, or they

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:14.590
are introduced to them
by trusted advisers.

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:17.900
So someone who knows the startup
and knows the angel

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.520
investor will put them together
and introduce them.

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:24.870
Those are the two
typical ways.

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:32.140
VCs can also sort of introduce
you to people, where they're

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:35.230
not ready to put their money
in, but they'll introduce

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:38.730
founders to angel investors
who will put up the money.

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:40.419
So there's a variety
of different ways.

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:43.610
But basically, it's either you
have to know the angel

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:47.230
investor already, have worked
with them in the past, or they

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:50.550
got introduced by someone
that they trust.

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:52.200
MARTIN OMANDER: What is a
startup to do, a startup

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:56.400
founder, if they don't
know angel investors?

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.570
DON DODGE: I think the best way
to do it is go to other

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:02.130
startup founders
that you know.

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:04.250
So typically, you're going to
know someone who was in a

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:08.380
startup or a founder at another
startup, and ask them

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:11.220
to introduce you to investors.

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:14.970
Or you're going to know
investors who have invested in

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:17.140
other things and ask them
for introductions.

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:21.490
So it's really just reaching out
to your network of friends

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:25.320
and coworkers, and seeing if
they know investors and

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.080
getting an introduction
that way.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:31.140
The other way is show
up at conferences.

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:34.710
So conferences like the Launch
Conference or Demo or

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:39.290
TechCrunch Disrupt or Google
I/O, or any of these shows

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:42.450
that are tech conferences,
typically there are a lot of

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:43.850
investors there.

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:45.530
And if you go to these
conferences, you're going to

00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:49.520
meet people and meet investors
and that's a good way.

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:53.470
The third way is you should be
writing a blog and writing

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:57.940
about your experiences, and
people will find you that way.

00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:00.710
So one of those three ways,
you can find an investor.

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:02.950
MARTIN OMANDER: I see.

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:08.890
So tell us a little bit more
about this convertible note.

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:11.980
What does a deal typically
look like?

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:17.050
What are typical numbers
involved in the Seed Round?

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:18.960
DON DODGE: So a convertible
note in a Seed Round is

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:22.950
usually somewhere between
$100,000 and maybe up to $1

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:25.740
million that you're raising.

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:28.950
A convertible note typically has
an interest rate, like say

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:35.760
2% to 4% interest, and it has
a discount to the equity.

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.690
They call it a convertible note,
because it converts from

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:41.800
debt to equity at
the Series A.

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:48.610
So it might say 2% to 4%
interest rate, a 20% discount.

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:52.450
What that means is, if you raise
your Series A at a $5

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:56.950
million valuation, the seed or
angel investor gets a 20%

00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:58.240
discount to that.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.710
So a 20% discount off of $5
million is $4 million.

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:04.290
So you get to put your money
in at $4 million, while the

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:07.320
series A investor puts theirs
in at $5 million.

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:11.540
So those are the basic terms.

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:13.990
There's also a cap sometimes.

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:20.240
A cap means if I put in my money
early, and you raise a

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:24.720
Series A at a $20 million
valuation, that's not really

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:25.940
fair to the investors.

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:30.560
So what they'll say is there'll
be a 20% discount to

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:36.090
the Series A price or a cap
of, let's say, $4 million.

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:39.200
So it doesn't matter if you
raise your Series A at $10

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:42.040
million, the angel investor's
going to get in

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.110
at a cap of $4 million.

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:47.380
So the three basic terms are
the interest rate, the

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:51.815
discount to the next round, and
the cap on the valuation.

00:11:51.815 --> 00:11:54.050
MARTIN OMANDER: It's going to be
hard to know what valuation

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:56.570
it will be one round
into the future.

00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:59.470
DON DODGE: That's precisely why
they do convertible notes.

00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:03.200
In the past, they used to try to
do Series A, where you have

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.740
to establish the valuation
that you're going to

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:06.670
put the money in.

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:09.850
But the reality is that it's so
early that you don't know

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:12.090
what the valuation's
going to be.

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:15.600
So a convertible note allows the
investor to put money into

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:20.630
the company, and have a floor
and a ceiling on what the

00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:22.440
valuation will be.

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:26.230
So that 20% discount gives them
a discount off whatever

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:30.060
that valuation is established
by the VCs later.

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:33.400
The cap also protects them
from the upside.

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:38.680
So the valuation can go to $10
million or $20 million, but at

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:42.520
least the early seed-stage
investor gets their valuation

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:46.640
capped at an amount like, say,
$4 million or $5 million.

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:47.920
MARTIN OMANDER: All right.

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:49.750
What should startups look for?

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:52.010
Or rather, should startups
look for anything in an

00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:54.540
investor except money?

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:55.600
And if so, what?

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.010
DON DODGE: Yeah.

00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:59.570
You want people who
can help you.

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:04.960
So VCs always say that they do
more than write a check.

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:06.370
They help you build
a business.

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:09.240
And you want to do the same
thing with angel investors.

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:12.840
So you want to look for angels
who have maybe had experience

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:16.890
in this market segment before,
or have built a company

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:22.510
before, or know people in the
industry or companies in the

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:25.110
industry that you want
to partner with.

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:28.360
So you want to look for angel
investors who have experience,

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:33.920
who have connections, who can
help you, give you advice on

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:37.220
when to do certain things or
how to avoid mistakes.

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:38.580
So these angel investors--

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:42.710
they call them angels because
they help you.

00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:45.590
They're like angels who descend,
and fix things for

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:46.550
you and help you.

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:47.240
MARTIN OMANDER: Right.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:48.630
OK.

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:55.370
So you see startups coming and
asking for seed investments.

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:58.530
What are some of the common
mistakes you see startups make

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:01.460
when they're looking for
seed investment?

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:04.700
DON DODGE: Well, there's a
couple mistakes, common ones.

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:09.130
First one is, they don't
raise enough money.

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:12.390
So they have fairly modest
goals, and they might raise

00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:17.590
$100,000 when they really
need $500,000.

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:20.210
And raising money takes
a lot of time.

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:22.030
It's distracting.

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:24.420
It takes you away from building
the product, and

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:26.470
building the company that
you want to build.

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:29.030
So I think the first mistake
is they don't

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:30.210
raise enough money.

00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:34.010
So always try to raise twice
as much as you think you're

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:37.520
going to need, because you're
probably estimating wrong.

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.220
And if you have more money
than you need,

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:40.140
then life is good.

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:41.790
So don't worry about it.

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:43.290
So that's the first mistake--

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:44.730
not raising enough money.

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:46.960
Second mistake is taking
money from people

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:49.290
who can't help you.

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:53.060
Then you're not getting the
value out of that investment

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:55.630
if they're not experienced
people who have built a

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:59.500
company before, or who can make
connections for you that

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:01.380
you need, introduce
you to people.

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:04.800
And actually, looking ahead to
raising that venture capital

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:08.290
round, you want your angel
investors to be the people who

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:10.810
can help open the door so that
you can raise your venture

00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:12.543
capital round.

00:15:12.543 --> 00:15:13.840
MARTIN OMANDER: Right.

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:18.710
So how do you think about what
is enough for the Seed Round?

00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:23.940
You said it's a common mistake
to ask for not enough.

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:26.070
How do you determine
what is enough?

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:29.180
DON DODGE: Well, I think the
real question is what are you

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:30.450
going to do with this money?

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:33.150
So what milestone are
you going to reach?

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:35.720
And I think that means
that you have to

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:37.500
have the product working.

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:42.090
You have to have users, or you
have to have first revenue.

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:44.970
So you need to think of how long
is it going to take me to

00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:46.120
build this product?

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:47.720
How long is it going to
take me to get to the

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:49.770
first 10,000 users?

00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:52.595
How long is it going to take me
to get to the first million

00:15:52.595 --> 00:15:54.130
dollars of revenue?

00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:56.180
And sort of map that out.

00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:59.420
And there's no correct answer,
because you don't really know.

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:01.710
But estimate how long it's
going to take you.

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:04.050
Figure out how much money you're
going to burn between

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:06.280
now and then, and then
double it, because

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:07.730
you're probably wrong.

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:09.373
So that's how I do it.

00:16:09.373 --> 00:16:10.510
MARTIN OMANDER: Right.

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:12.420
Multiply it by pi?

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:12.900
DON DODGE: Well, you could.

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:13.828
MARTIN OMANDER: Two is--

00:16:13.828 --> 00:16:16.010
two is enough.

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:19.300
Don, are you seeing any
trends or changes?

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:21.920
Is angel investing different
now than it was a

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:23.440
couple of years ago?

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:27.580
DON DODGE: I think there are
more angels involved now.

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:31.570
AngelList has been a boon
to the industry.

00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:35.330
AngelList is a place where
angel investors can view

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:40.200
business plans and proposals
from hundreds and hundreds of

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.460
entrepreneurs and startups.

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:45.200
So I think there are more
angels involved.

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:48.090
There's more money available.

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:50.920
But the angels are getting
smarter and

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:53.440
demanding more progress.

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:57.080
They're demanding that the teams
be more fully developed,

00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:02.360
that the product be out there
at least in beta, or have

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:06.380
users that are using it that
sort of prove that, yes, this

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:07.970
team can deliver.

00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:10.410
Yes, there are users
who are interested

00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:13.099
in using the product.

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:14.560
So I think it's getting
a little harder.

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:16.500
Even though there are more
angels involved, and there's

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:20.680
more money available, it's
raised the bar on the quality

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:24.319
and how far you have to be
before they write a check.

00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:26.750
MARTIN OMANDER: Is that
a good thing?

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:28.970
DON DODGE: Well, some would
argue that there are too many

00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:30.470
companies being funded.

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:35.420
And they talk about the Series
A crunch, where lots and lots

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:38.920
of companies get angel funding,
but then can't raise

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:42.880
the Series A. So some would
argue that there's too much

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:44.190
angel funding.

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:46.170
And I don't believe
that's true.

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:50.980
I think that the more people out
there trying their ideas

00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:54.060
and building their companies,
the better off we all are.

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:57.710
And yeah, not all of them are
going to raise a Series A. But

00:17:57.710 --> 00:18:00.210
that happens all the way up the
chain, where you raise a

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:05.380
Series A, and they have
struggled to raise a series B.

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:06.720
MARTIN OMANDER: I've been in
a startup like that, yes.

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:07.620
DON DODGE: Yeah, it happens.

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:10.420
So no, I don't think
there's too many.

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:14.010
I think more angel investors
getting involved and more

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:18.570
startups springing up result in
more opportunities for big

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:20.800
companies to emerge.

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:22.280
So I think it's a good thing.

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:23.420
MARTIN OMANDER: Great.

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:28.260
Finally, Don, if viewers only
remember one or two things

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:31.040
about the seed investment
round, what is the most

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:33.560
important for startups
to remember?

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:36.270
DON DODGE: Well, when investors
look at a company or

00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:38.880
look at an opportunity, they're
thinking about team,

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:39.900
number one.

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:41.940
So don't go it alone.

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:45.300
You have to have at least
one other co-founder.

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:46.700
And it's all about the team.

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:51.090
So have a strong team of people
who you have a lot of

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:55.840
confidence in, where you have
complimentary skills, where

00:18:55.840 --> 00:19:01.110
they cover things that you
don't, where you have

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:03.090
confidence that you
can build this.

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:05.580
So team is number one.

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:08.970
The second is make sure you
raise enough money.

00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:11.990
Don't get caught short.

00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:17.090
And maybe the third thing is
have a good idea of how you're

00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:18.700
going to produce revenue.

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:21.220
The days are over when you could
say, we're just going to

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:23.570
focus on the product and build
audience, and figure out how

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:24.900
to monetize later.

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:26.340
Those days are over.

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:29.820
Now you have to have a plan on
how you're going to get from

00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:33.110
where you are today to revenue
so that an investor can

00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:35.620
connect the dots from where
you are to where

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:37.450
they want to be.

00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:39.220
MARTIN OMANDER: I've been
in one or two startups

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:41.010
that were like that.

00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:43.010
Let's figure out how to
make money later.

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:45.680
Doesn't always work out.

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:48.040
Thank you, Don, for sharing
your experience with us.

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:49.620
DON DODGE: Well, thanks
for having me.

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:51.650
MARTIN OMANDER: So thank
you for listening.

00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:54.450
In the next episode, we'll
talk about how you, as a

00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:56.920
startup, can get the
attention of A

00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:59.630
list influential bloggers.

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:04.310
Please look at the programs
listings for "Root Access" on

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:06.910
GDL and see you next time.

00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:08.160
Bye.
