Now, before we write the second part of this

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.330
program, I want you to experiment with built-in functions.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.340
Pick anyone of the built-in functions, read through their

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.560
documentation. By the way, the link to this page is

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.160
available in the instructor notes. Use your chosen built-in

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.940
functions in a new program and then share your

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.400
experiences on the forum. You should answer questions like:

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.210
Which built in function did you actually decide to use?

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.530
What did your program do? And what problems did you run into?

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:35.820
By the way, being able to read documentation and experimenting with Python, is

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.840
a big part of learning how to program. Once you've posted your

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.500
responses on the forum, feel free to check this box before you continue.
