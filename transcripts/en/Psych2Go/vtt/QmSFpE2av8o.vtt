[Intro]

00:00:07.835 --> 00:00:12.073
Hey guys, my name's Alanniel Davis] for psych2go, and today I'm going to be talking about the

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.923
article, All Eyes on Me: The Spotlight Effect by Jenny Kang. Have you ever done something

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:22.728
really embarrassing and felt like everyone was noticing? Like, you got a stain on your shirt and

00:00:22.737 --> 00:00:26.553
you walk through school or you walk through the mall and you just feel like everyone is looking

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:31.415
at the stain on your shirt? If you've felt something like this, then you are experiencing the

00:00:31.422 --> 00:00:33.270
spotlight effect.

00:00:33.273 --> 00:00:39.589
The spotlight effect was coined in 1999 by Kenneth Savitsky and Thomas Thomas Gilovich. They

00:00:39.599 --> 00:00:44.239
were trying to give a name of the phenomenon of feeling like more people are noticing

00:00:44.246 --> 00:00:49.614
something about you, or something that you did, than are probably actually noticing. As if

00:00:49.622 --> 00:00:54.123
everyone is staring at you when in reality, not every person is staring at you.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:59.414
The reason that we experience the spotlight effect at all is purely because of where our

00:00:59.422 --> 00:01:05.674
perspective is, which is from us. So, anything that we do, anything that happens to us, has more

00:01:05.684 --> 00:01:12.815
priority of us noticing it than anything else happening to anyone else, or anywhere else. Because

00:01:12.826 --> 00:01:15.438
this is front and center in our view.

00:01:15.442 --> 00:01:21.138
In short, we actually care more about the things that happen to us than anyone else, simply

00:01:21.146 --> 00:01:26.655
because of our perspective, of what we notice first and what do we experience firsthand. But,

00:01:26.664 --> 00:01:32.101
when you realize that this is happening to you, you have to also realize that it's happening to

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:39.574
everyone else. Your perspective is focused on you. Their perspective is also focused on them.

00:01:39.585 --> 00:01:43.822
So, even though you know that you have a stain on your shirt as you're walking through the

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.940
mall, not everyone is going to actually notice. They are far more interested in the way that they

00:01:49.949 --> 00:01:55.140
look than the way that you look, because the way that they look matters most to them.

00:01:55.148 --> 00:02:00.356
We forget sometimes that not everyone notices the things that we notice, or not everyone pays

00:02:00.364 --> 00:02:05.901
attention to the things that we pay attention to. So, even though we're really worried, really, we

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:11.250
don't have any actual reason to, because everyone else is probably thinking about something

00:02:11.258 --> 00:02:16.234
embarrassing that happened to them. Or, they're really concerned that they don't look on-point

00:02:16.241 --> 00:02:23.416
today, like I am. I just got off work, so this is not my hottest appearance. But, I'm making a

00:02:23.427 --> 00:02:27.250
video anyway, because you probably didn't even actually care, did you?

00:02:27.256 --> 00:02:32.066
You didn't realize that my hair has been in a hairnet, basically, all day. But I did, and I'm

00:02:32.073 --> 00:02:37.430
thinking about that right now. Oh God, I should probably stop this. But look, it's okay. You can

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:43.332
relax. Not everyone is noticing that stain. Not everyone remembers that embarrassing thing that

00:02:43.341 --> 00:02:48.961
you did yesterday, or in the third grade, if that's what's itching at you. You just have to own

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:53.312
what happened to you, because it happened to you, and then you brush it off. Because honestly,

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:56.827
no one else in the world cares as much as you do.

00:02:56.832 --> 00:03:03.015
So, that should actually feel really good to you. It might sound really selfish or self-centered, but

00:03:03.025 --> 00:03:09.311
honestly, that's a good thing. You may have spilt that ketchup, but listen. No one is going to

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:14.342
remember for as long as you will. So, even if someone noticed, it's okay. And honestly, you

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:20.365
should be able to feel really relaxed in that fact, that it doesn't actually matter.

00:03:20.374 --> 00:03:24.996
And if that doesn't feel good, I don't know what does! Because that's very relieving to me,

00:03:25.003 --> 00:03:30.540
honestly. I have a question, have you ever experienced the spotlight- that is a really stupid

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:35.954
question. You have obviously experienced the spotlight effect. I want you to tell me what

00:03:35.962 --> 00:03:40.990
