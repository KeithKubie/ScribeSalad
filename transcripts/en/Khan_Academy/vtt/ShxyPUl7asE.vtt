00:00:00.373 --> 00:00:02.792
- So in the last video, we
did our circuit analysis.

00:00:02.792 --> 00:00:05.587
We set up the four
equations that we needed

00:00:05.587 --> 00:00:08.109
to solve in order to
figure out all the voltages

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.263
and currents in our example circuit.

00:00:11.263 --> 00:00:12.892
And so now, we're gonna solve it.

00:00:12.892 --> 00:00:14.741
This is a matter of doing the algebra

00:00:14.741 --> 00:00:18.630
to solve a set of four
simultaneous equations.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.620
What I wanna do now is just
write my equations down here

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.753
and tidy them up a little bit.

00:00:23.753 --> 00:00:25.335
So the first one we're gonna bring down

00:00:25.335 --> 00:00:27.976
is the voltage statement here,

00:00:27.976 --> 00:00:30.395
which I can write as

00:00:30.395 --> 00:00:31.228
V1 plus V2

00:00:35.305 --> 00:00:36.138
equals Vs.

00:00:39.285 --> 00:00:43.548
I'm gonna bring down the
i equation over here.

00:00:43.548 --> 00:00:44.631
It's gonna be

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.117
i1 minus i2

00:00:52.241 --> 00:00:53.074
equals Is.

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:57.495
And now I have to pick.

00:00:57.495 --> 00:00:58.989
I have four variables here.

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:01.514
I'm gonna start doing substitutions

00:01:01.514 --> 00:01:04.402
based on these expressions up here.

00:01:04.402 --> 00:01:05.999
These are my Ohm's law expressions.

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:09.148
So we're gonna use those to
substitute for the voltages,

00:01:09.148 --> 00:01:12.849
and we're gonna solve the whole
thing in terms of currents.

00:01:12.849 --> 00:01:15.766
So the first equation becomes V1 is

00:01:19.147 --> 00:01:19.980
R1 i1 plus

00:01:23.777 --> 00:01:24.610
R2 i2

00:01:27.652 --> 00:01:28.485
equals Vs.

00:01:29.683 --> 00:01:31.352
Second equation stays the same.

00:01:31.352 --> 00:01:32.269
i1 minus i2

00:01:35.796 --> 00:01:36.629
equals Is.

00:01:39.334 --> 00:01:40.872
The next step in the solution is gonna be

00:01:40.872 --> 00:01:44.271
to figure out how to eliminate
one of these currents.

00:01:44.271 --> 00:01:47.471
Now I think what I'll do is I'll eliminate

00:01:47.471 --> 00:01:51.554
i2, and I can do that if
I multiply this equation

00:01:53.948 --> 00:01:57.198
by R2 and add these equations together.

00:01:59.788 --> 00:02:02.612
So let's do the
multiplication by R2 first.

00:02:02.612 --> 00:02:04.876
We'll rewrite the first equation up here.

00:02:04.876 --> 00:02:06.209
R1 i1 plus R2 i2

00:02:11.653 --> 00:02:15.403
equals Vs, and then
down, the bottom equation

00:02:17.166 --> 00:02:18.583
is gonna be R2 i1

00:02:23.191 --> 00:02:24.108
minus R2 i2

00:02:28.372 --> 00:02:29.455
equals R2 Is.

00:02:34.235 --> 00:02:37.131
We're gonna add these equations together.

00:02:37.131 --> 00:02:40.881
And we can see these
terms nicely cancel out,

00:02:40.881 --> 00:02:43.214
and so I'm gonna end up with

00:02:44.292 --> 00:02:45.125
R1 plus R2

00:02:49.763 --> 00:02:51.013
times i1 equals

00:02:55.336 --> 00:02:56.169
Vs plus R2

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.843
Is.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.179
And I can get the solution
in symbolic terms for i1.

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:09.012
I1 equals

00:03:12.238 --> 00:03:13.321
Vs plus R2 Is

00:03:18.004 --> 00:03:19.337
over R1 plus R2.

00:03:27.051 --> 00:03:28.729
What I wanna do now is actually put in

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:31.660
the original real values
and solve this circuit

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.327
all the way through.

00:03:34.448 --> 00:03:37.115
So we'll move up and keep going.

00:03:39.904 --> 00:03:42.414
So let me sketch the circuit again,

00:03:42.414 --> 00:03:43.822
the real circuit again.

00:03:43.822 --> 00:03:48.219
We had a voltage source
with fifteen volts.

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:51.386
It went to a 4k resistor, that was R1.

00:03:57.864 --> 00:03:59.947
We had a 2k resistor here

00:04:02.891 --> 00:04:04.641
and a current source,

00:04:09.451 --> 00:04:11.534
and that was 3 milliamps.

00:04:15.067 --> 00:04:17.234
And we want to discover...

00:04:18.565 --> 00:04:20.982
This was i1, and this was i2.

00:04:24.776 --> 00:04:26.402
Those are the two unknown currents.

00:04:26.402 --> 00:04:27.954
Let's see if we can find those.

00:04:27.954 --> 00:04:28.787
So i1

00:04:30.973 --> 00:04:32.056
equals Vs, 15

00:04:36.264 --> 00:04:39.514
plus R2 is 2k times Is, three milliamps

00:04:46.906 --> 00:04:48.739
divided by 4k plus 2k.

00:04:55.472 --> 00:04:56.738
So let's solve this.

00:04:56.738 --> 00:04:57.905
That equals 15

00:05:00.203 --> 00:05:03.786
plus 2k times three
milliamps is six volts.

00:05:07.473 --> 00:05:10.473
This is volts, and that's divided by

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.157
6k equals 21 volts over 6k

00:05:22.566 --> 00:05:24.316
equals 3.5 milliamps.

00:05:29.344 --> 00:05:31.956
So that's this value right here,

00:05:31.956 --> 00:05:33.039
3.5 milliamps

00:05:36.353 --> 00:05:37.186
is i1.

00:05:40.605 --> 00:05:42.498
So we have one of our unknown currents,

00:05:42.498 --> 00:05:44.402
and we wanna find the other one.

00:05:44.402 --> 00:05:46.976
That's sitting right here.

00:05:46.976 --> 00:05:48.726
We can figure out i2.

00:05:51.281 --> 00:05:53.531
Minus i2 equals Is minus i1

00:06:01.986 --> 00:06:04.319
equals three milliamps minus

00:06:11.212 --> 00:06:12.295
3.5 milliamps

00:06:17.625 --> 00:06:18.958
equals minus .5.

00:06:24.593 --> 00:06:26.305
Let's get rid of the minus signs.

00:06:26.305 --> 00:06:28.305
i2 equals 0.5 milliamps.

00:06:33.503 --> 00:06:36.003
That's that value right there.

00:06:39.836 --> 00:06:43.462
Let's put some boxes around
our answers we have so far.

00:06:43.462 --> 00:06:44.379
Here's one.

00:06:46.875 --> 00:06:50.375
And here's another one, there's i2 and i1.

00:06:51.395 --> 00:06:55.948
And now let's finish up by
figuring out the voltages.

00:06:55.948 --> 00:06:58.813
We can use Ohm's law to
figure out the voltage

00:06:58.813 --> 00:07:02.200
across the 4k resistor, and that's V1.

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.533
So V1 equals i, which is 3.5

00:07:09.068 --> 00:07:10.651
milliamps times 4k.

00:07:15.154 --> 00:07:20.059
4k ohms and that equals,
three and a half times four

00:07:20.059 --> 00:07:21.059
is 14 volts.

00:07:24.137 --> 00:07:27.606
Whenever you multiply
milliamps times k ohms,

00:07:27.606 --> 00:07:30.773
those units cancel, and you get volts.

00:07:32.409 --> 00:07:34.242
So V1 equals 14 volts.

00:07:45.552 --> 00:07:48.968
And our last current,
sorry, our last voltage

00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:51.718
is V2, is the voltage right here.

00:07:53.656 --> 00:07:54.489
And V2

00:07:57.081 --> 00:08:00.581
equals i2 which we decided was .5 milliamp

00:08:05.019 --> 00:08:07.352
times two thousand ohms, 2k.

00:08:10.679 --> 00:08:12.596
And V2 equals one volt.

00:08:32.727 --> 00:08:34.465
And now we've solved our circuit.

00:08:34.465 --> 00:08:36.308
That's a complete circuit analysis

00:08:36.308 --> 00:08:38.558
using the fundamental laws.
