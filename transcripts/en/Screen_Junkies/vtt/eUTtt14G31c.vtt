00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:14.800
In a world created by fat computer programmers,
comes a film so epic, it increased ticket

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.700
prices three whole dollars.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:18.970
Avatar.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.240
Meet Jake Sully, a marine who is contacted
by the government because his dead twin brother,

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.420
Tommy, was part of a secret scientific program
that engineered expensive synthetic Avatar

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.730
bodies capable of being driven by human drivers
when wired into a computer, but only if the

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.640
DNA genomes of the driver and Avatar body
match, which Jake’s does because he’s

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.640
a twin.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.059
So the government takes advantage of this
fact by asking Jake to drive Tomy’s Avatar

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.830
body to a rich deposit of space coal called
Unobtanium, which is sitting under a tree

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.969
called Home Tree, which is occupied by the
native people called the Na’vi.

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.910
It’s kinda dumb.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.199
Meet Neytiri.

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:47.219
But more importantly, meet her side-bloobs.

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.739
Together, they’ll learn: military bad.

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:53.379
Trees good.

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:58.370
Travel to a futuristic world of spaceships,
Mech-Warriors and...

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.489
really crappy wheelchairs?

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:05.260
Follow along with a team of scientists who
blend in with the natives by wearing the GAP

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:06.560
khaki collection.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.770
Discover the Na’vi, a strong and noble race
of blue Indians, fully in-tune with nature,

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.400
who are somehow helpless without the white
man.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.360
It’s actually kind of offensive when you
think about it.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:31.619
This December, prepare for three hours of
eyeball twitching.

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.149
As you’re force-fed the most obvious message
ever.

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:38.710
"They’re just goddamn trees!"

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.580
It will leave you wondering:

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.659
did I see her nipple?

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:43.659
Starring

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:44.780
the recycled plots from:

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.390
Dances with Wolves.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:47.390
Pocahontas.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:48.410
Last of the Mohicans.

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.579
An Inconvenient Truth.

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.260
Native American History.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.530
And Fern Gully.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:54.530
Papyrus.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.200
Um, I mean, Avatar.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.200
Ugh.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.200
We get it.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.200
We’ll recycle.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.610
Please, just make another Terminator already.

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.369
Tell us what movie you want to see as an Honest
Trailer next and leave a comment with a word

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.410
you’d like to hear me say in my awesome
voice.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.920
For example, jazzersize.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.180
