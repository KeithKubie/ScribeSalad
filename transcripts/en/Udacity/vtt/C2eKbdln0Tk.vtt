00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Okay, so you have this amazing new skill, and you can calculate all sorts of motion problems.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Now, can you calculate every motion problem?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The answer is not quite yet.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
There are two types of problems we still can't solve.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We can't solve problems where an object starts with some initial velocity,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and we can't solve problems where the object moves in two dimensions,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
but we'll get to that later.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
For now let's talk about this initial velocity idea.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
The variable we're going to use to talk about initial velocity is V with the subscript 0.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
This comes from the idea that when we start a problem

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
we usually start our timer at 0.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So this is at time equals 0 what is the velocity?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Let's think back to Galileo standing on top of the leaning tower of Pisa.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
This time around, instead of just having him drop the ball,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
let's imagine he could throw the ball straight down with different initial velocities.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Now, just to get you thinking, I want to think about this question,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
when will the ball go farther?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
If he drops the ball with an initial speed of 0--so that's truly just dropping the ball

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and not throwing it at all--will the ball go farther then?

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Let's say in a single second?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Or will the ball go farther if he throws it at 10 m/s straight down?

00:01:03.000 --> 99:59:59.000
In one second, when will the ball go farther?
