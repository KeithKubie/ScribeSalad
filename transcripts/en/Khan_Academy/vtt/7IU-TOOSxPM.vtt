00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.690
- [Narrator] We are asked
how many proportional

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:06.340
relationships are shown in
the coordinate plane below?

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.010
And we have the choices,
but let's actually look

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.040
at the coordinate plane below,

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.780
to think about how many
proportional relationships

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:15.613
are depicted here.

00:00:15.613 --> 00:00:18.343
So pause this video and try
to answer that yourself.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.760
So let's do this together.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.520
So, if we're thinking about
a proportional relationship,

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.080
or the graph of a
proportional relationship,

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.390
there should be two things
that we're looking for.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.090
One, it should be a line.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.830
It should be a linear relationship

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.580
between the two variables.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.170
Y should be some constant,

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.050
some proportionality constant, times X.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.240
So you immediately would rule
out our green curve, here

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.060
because this is not a line.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.120
You don't have a constant relationship

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.970
between Y being some
proportionality constant times X.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.240
And for the same reason you
would rule out this blue curve.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.120
Now what about this purple line?

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.600
This might be tempting
because it is a line,

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.520
but it does not go through the origin.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.610
When X is two, Y is zero times X.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.240
While, when X is four, Y is one times X.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.240
And when X is six, Y looks
to be, 1 and 1/3 times X.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.600
So you don't have the same
proportionality constant

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.780
the entire time.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.720
So, we have zero proportional
relationships depicted here.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.560
So I would pick zero there.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.433
Let's do one more example.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.890
Natalie is an expert archer.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.460
The following table
shows her scores, points,

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.890
based on the number of targets she hits.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.150
All right, targets hit
and then points she gets.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.430
Plot the ordered pairs from the table.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.130
All right, so the first one is 1, 3.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.930
So here I'm doing it on Khan Academy.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.660
My horizontal axis is targets hit,

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.400
and my vertical axis is points.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.240
So, one target hit, three points.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.400
So this is going to be one target hit,

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.283
this is going to be three points.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.840
Then I have two targets hit, six points.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.510
So two targets hit, and I have six points.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.053
And then I'm gonna have
five targets hit, 15 points.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.940
So then I'm going to
have five targets hit,

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.240
and that is going to be 15 points.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.210
And so this is looking like
a proportional relationship.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.000
In every situation my point is equal to

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.460
three times the targets hit.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.820
So my proportionality constant is three.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.920
And you can see if you
try to connect these dots

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.090
with a line, it will be a line.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.400
A line can go through all three of these,

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.273
and it will go through the origin.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.460
So are Natalie's points
proportional to the number

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.210
of targets she hit?

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:02.783
Yes, absolutely.
