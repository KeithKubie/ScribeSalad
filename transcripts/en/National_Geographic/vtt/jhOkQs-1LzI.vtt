00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.004
( intro music )

00:00:06.806 --> 00:00:08.841
About a week
into our expedition

00:00:08.841 --> 00:00:13.545
a rebel group from the
Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan

00:00:13.812 --> 00:00:15.114
moved through the valley

00:00:15.114 --> 00:00:17.951
and they saw us 1,000 feet
up on this big wall

00:00:17.951 --> 00:00:20.252
and they saw this as
this opportunity.

00:00:20.252 --> 00:00:21.687
And so, we awoke one morning

00:00:21.687 --> 00:00:23.689
to bullets flying
around our portaledges.

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:24.891
The message was quite clear.

00:00:24.891 --> 00:00:26.059
We had to come down

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:27.760
or we would get shot.

00:00:27.827 --> 00:00:29.962
So, we spent a couple hours
rappelling to the ground.

00:00:29.962 --> 00:00:32.164
And when we got to the
ground, we were greeted with

00:00:32.164 --> 00:00:35.367
these very scary-looking
guys, with big guns

00:00:35.367 --> 00:00:38.605
and army fatigues and
large beards and...

00:00:39.171 --> 00:00:40.373
We were taken hostage.

00:00:41.407 --> 00:00:45.544
And, few hours after we were
actually taken as hostages

00:00:45.544 --> 00:00:48.515
the Kyrgyz Military
moved into the valley

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:52.218
and this incredible battle
erupted all around us.

00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:54.186
We watched in horror as

00:00:54.186 --> 00:00:58.158
a Kyrgyz shoul-- soldier was
shot point blank in the head.

00:00:58.591 --> 00:01:01.494
And we were forced to lie on
his body for like four hours

00:01:01.494 --> 00:01:04.564
as this crazy battle
raged around us.

00:01:04.564 --> 00:01:08.434
Heavy machine gun fire, mortars
were shot over our heads.

00:01:09.035 --> 00:01:12.171
And then for the next
six days we hid.

00:01:12.839 --> 00:01:16.175
During the day we would bury
ourselves in holes in the ground

00:01:16.175 --> 00:01:18.978
cover ourselves up with brush
and lay completely still.

00:01:18.978 --> 00:01:22.448
At night we would sneak from
one location to the next.

00:01:22.949 --> 00:01:25.451
On the sixth night of captivity

00:01:25.451 --> 00:01:27.186
something clicked inside of me

00:01:27.186 --> 00:01:29.722
like, this real
survival instinct kicked in.

00:01:29.722 --> 00:01:32.959
I suddenly felt as though
I'd be able to sprint uphill

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:35.394
without my heart rate
even rising.

00:01:35.394 --> 00:01:38.030
So, a plan was hatched
for the head captor

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.801
to try and like head back to our
basecamp and get some food.

00:01:41.801 --> 00:01:44.503
And then we were told to climb
up this steep mountainside

00:01:44.503 --> 00:01:46.505
with our one remaining captor.

00:01:46.872 --> 00:01:48.174
And so we started climbing

00:01:48.174 --> 00:01:50.142
we were climbers, very
comfortable on this terrain

00:01:50.142 --> 00:01:52.144
our captor was not comfortable.

00:01:52.144 --> 00:01:55.614
And I started to think if we
didn't get out of here soon

00:01:55.614 --> 00:01:58.284
like, we might not last
very much longer.

00:01:58.284 --> 00:02:00.252
And so,
when we were probably

00:02:00.252 --> 00:02:02.088
a couple thousand feet
up this mountainside

00:02:02.088 --> 00:02:06.593
in a super exposed section
of the climb...

00:02:08.428 --> 00:02:11.830
I decided that I had to take
matters into my own hands.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.701
So, I scrambled up behind
this one remaining captor

00:02:15.701 --> 00:02:17.103
and I grabbed the gun strap

00:02:17.103 --> 00:02:19.005
for the gun that was
strapped over his shoulder

00:02:19.005 --> 00:02:21.807
and I yanked backwards
on it as hard as I could

00:02:21.807 --> 00:02:26.146
and I watched him fall 50 feet,
hit a sloping ramp and then

00:02:26.812 --> 00:02:28.581
off into the blackness.
