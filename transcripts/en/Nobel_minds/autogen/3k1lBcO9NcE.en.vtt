hi my name is ELISA Anna my question is

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370
hi my name is ELISA Anna my question is
 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:03.889
hi my name is ELISA Anna my question is
how likely is it that there's life out

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899
how likely is it that there's life out
 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:04.840
how likely is it that there's life out
there

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:04.850
there
 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.839
there
hi Ellis yeah how likely is there to be

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849
hi Ellis yeah how likely is there to be
 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.120
hi Ellis yeah how likely is there to be
life out there in the universe it's a

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130
life out there in the universe it's a
 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.110
life out there in the universe it's a
great question we've many people would

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120
great question we've many people would
 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.510
great question we've many people would
love the discover life especially

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520
love the discover life especially
 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.460
love the discover life especially
intelligent life out there in the

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470
intelligent life out there in the
 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.359
intelligent life out there in the
universe I think more scientists now

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369
universe I think more scientists now
 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.570
universe I think more scientists now
believe that the chances of finding life

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580
believe that the chances of finding life
 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.820

someplace in our galaxy are pretty high

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830
someplace in our galaxy are pretty high
 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:36.110
someplace in our galaxy are pretty high
we understand from biology that life

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120
we understand from biology that life
 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.810
we understand from biology that life
began on earth almost as soon as it

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820
began on earth almost as soon as it
 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.440
began on earth almost as soon as it
could didn't take long after the earth

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450
could didn't take long after the earth
 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:50.330
could didn't take long after the earth
quieted down for life to emerge and we

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340
quieted down for life to emerge and we
 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.490
quieted down for life to emerge and we
have discovered in recent years that
