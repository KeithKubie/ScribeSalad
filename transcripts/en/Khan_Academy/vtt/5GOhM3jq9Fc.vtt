00:00:00.782 --> 00:00:02.791
- The new headquarters of Khan Academy

00:00:02.791 --> 00:00:05.263
is at 314 Math Avenue.

00:00:05.263 --> 00:00:07.005
It has 200 windows

00:00:07.005 --> 00:00:08.862
and has seven stories.

00:00:08.862 --> 00:00:11.799
The parking lot can fit 90 cars.

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:15.051
The building itself is 63 feet tall.

00:00:15.051 --> 00:00:17.639
How tall is each story?

00:00:17.639 --> 00:00:19.763
So, I encourage you to pause this video

00:00:19.763 --> 00:00:22.967
and try this on your own.

00:00:22.967 --> 00:00:24.140
So let's try to answer it.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.425
They're asking us how tall is each story?

00:00:27.425 --> 00:00:29.062
So, what information do we need?

00:00:29.062 --> 00:00:32.045
Well, we definitely
don't need the address.

00:00:32.045 --> 00:00:34.878
We don't care how many windows it has.

00:00:34.878 --> 00:00:37.142
Now, the number of
stories seems interesting,

00:00:37.142 --> 00:00:38.187
especially because they tell us

00:00:38.187 --> 00:00:39.638
the total number of feet

00:00:39.638 --> 00:00:41.240
or the total height of the building.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.401
For example, they tell us

00:00:42.401 --> 00:00:44.444
that the building is 63 feet tall.

00:00:44.444 --> 00:00:46.417
So, this height right over here,

00:00:46.417 --> 00:00:50.422
the building's height is 63 feet tall

00:00:50.422 --> 00:00:52.837
and they tell us that
it has seven stories.

00:00:52.837 --> 00:00:54.346
Seven stories.

00:00:54.346 --> 00:00:58.235
So, one, two, three, four,

00:00:58.235 --> 00:01:01.126
five, six and seven.

00:01:01.126 --> 00:01:03.018
So it has seven stories.

00:01:03.018 --> 00:01:06.814
So if we divide 63 by seven,

00:01:06.814 --> 00:01:09.821
we should figure out
how tall each story is.

00:01:09.821 --> 00:01:10.576
So let's do that.

00:01:10.576 --> 00:01:13.339
We're going to divide 63 feet

00:01:13.339 --> 00:01:14.836
divided by,

00:01:14.836 --> 00:01:17.738
divided by seven stories

00:01:17.738 --> 00:01:18.841
and this is going to tell us

00:01:18.841 --> 00:01:21.279
how tall each story is.

00:01:21.279 --> 00:01:25.342
So that's going to be
equal to question mark.

00:01:25.342 --> 00:01:27.873
Now, 63 divided by seven

00:01:27.873 --> 00:01:29.533
be equal to question mark.

00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:30.938
This is another way of saying

00:01:30.938 --> 00:01:32.935
that seven times question mark

00:01:32.935 --> 00:01:34.641
is going to be equal to 63.

00:01:34.641 --> 00:01:35.895
Let me write that down.

00:01:35.895 --> 00:01:37.638
So this is another way of saying

00:01:37.638 --> 00:01:41.258
that 63 is equal to,

00:01:41.258 --> 00:01:43.580
is equal to seven,

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.413
seven times,

00:01:46.413 --> 00:01:48.711
times question mark.

00:01:48.711 --> 00:01:50.557
Times question mark.

00:01:50.557 --> 00:01:51.614
So, if we can figure out

00:01:51.614 --> 00:01:53.517
what do we have to multiply seven by

00:01:53.517 --> 00:01:54.597
to get to 63,

00:01:54.597 --> 00:01:57.894
then we know what 63 divided by seven is.

00:01:57.894 --> 00:01:58.718
And to do that,

00:01:58.718 --> 00:02:01.516
I'm just going to skip count by seven.

00:02:01.516 --> 00:02:04.012
So, let's start with seven.

00:02:04.012 --> 00:02:06.496
So seven times one is seven.

00:02:06.496 --> 00:02:07.878
Seven, so let me just write this.

00:02:07.878 --> 00:02:09.573
Seven times one is seven.

00:02:09.573 --> 00:02:12.510
Seven times two is 14.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.492
Seven times three is 21.

00:02:16.492 --> 00:02:19.615
Seven times four is 28.

00:02:19.615 --> 00:02:22.331
Notice I'm just adding by seven each time.

00:02:22.331 --> 00:02:25.489
Seven times five is 35.

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.053
Seven times six is 42.

00:02:29.053 --> 00:02:32.733
Seven times seven is 49.

00:02:32.733 --> 00:02:36.807
Seven times eight is 56.

00:02:36.807 --> 00:02:38.096
Just adding seven.

00:02:38.096 --> 00:02:41.637
Seven times nine is 63.

00:02:41.637 --> 00:02:44.934
So we see, seven times nine is 63.

00:02:44.934 --> 00:02:48.486
So the question mark
must be equal to nine.

00:02:48.486 --> 00:02:52.596
Question mark must be equal to nine.

00:02:52.596 --> 00:02:55.951
So we can write that 63 divided by seven,

00:02:55.951 --> 00:03:00.734
63, 63 divided by seven,

00:03:00.734 --> 00:03:01.709
let me do the same colors

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.566
that I just used,

00:03:03.566 --> 00:03:08.566
63 divided by seven is equal to nine.

00:03:08.906 --> 00:03:11.228
Divided by seven is equal to nine.

00:03:11.228 --> 00:03:12.029
And let's,

00:03:12.029 --> 00:03:12.830
let's think about that.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.873
We're saying that if we take 63 feet

00:03:14.873 --> 00:03:16.766
and divide it into seven equal stories,

00:03:16.766 --> 00:03:19.563
that each story is going
to be nine feet on average.

00:03:19.563 --> 00:03:21.409
Does that make sense?

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:23.046
So, does it make sense

00:03:23.046 --> 00:03:25.090
that each of these,

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.723
each of these stories are
going to be nine feet?

00:03:28.723 --> 00:03:30.046
Well, we have seven of them,

00:03:30.046 --> 00:03:31.033
so it should be,

00:03:31.033 --> 00:03:33.123
just the first story should be nine feet.

00:03:33.123 --> 00:03:34.330
By the time we get to the second story,

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:35.863
we should be at 18 feet.

00:03:35.863 --> 00:03:37.267
I'm adding by nine now.

00:03:37.267 --> 00:03:39.183
Third story, the top of the third story

00:03:39.183 --> 00:03:40.889
should be 27 feet.

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:45.649
Top of the fourth story
is going to be 36 feet.

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:49.747
Top of the fifth story
is going to be 45 feet.

00:03:49.747 --> 00:03:54.747
Top of the sixth story
is going to be 54 feet.

00:03:54.948 --> 00:03:57.444
And then the top of the seventh story,

00:03:57.444 --> 00:03:58.883
which is also the top of the building,

00:03:58.883 --> 00:04:01.286
is going to be 63 feet.

00:04:01.286 --> 00:04:03.945
So, if each floor is nine feet high,

00:04:03.945 --> 00:04:05.849
you just have to keep adding nine

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:07.126
every time you add a floor

00:04:07.126 --> 00:04:08.461
and you see if you do that,

00:04:08.461 --> 00:04:10.039
if you have seven floors

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:12.245
you're going to get to 63 feet.

00:04:12.245 --> 00:04:13.267
So it completely makes sense,

00:04:13.267 --> 00:04:17.719
each story is nine feet tall.
