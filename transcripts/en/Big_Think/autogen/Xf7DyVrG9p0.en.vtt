of coworkers and the answers we get back
 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.260
of coworkers and the answers we get back
range anywhere from twenty percent to a

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270
range anywhere from twenty percent to a
 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.179
range anywhere from twenty percent to a
hundred percent so kind of worst case

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:12.189
hundred percent so kind of worst case
 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:14.640

for example during the training program

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590
for example during the training program
 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.889
for example during the training program

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899
at the end of the first week we make an
 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:36.649
at the end of the first week we make an
offer to everyone and the offer is that

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659

already spent training plus a bonus of

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560
already spent training plus a bonus of
 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.929

two thousand dollars to quit and leave

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939
two thousand dollars to quit and leave
 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.419
two thousand dollars to quit and leave
the company right then and that's

00:01:44.419 --> 00:01:44.429
the company right then and that's
 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:45.770
the company right then and that's
actually a standing offer until they

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780
actually a standing offer until they
 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.859
actually a standing offer until they
enter training and we've extended it

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869
enter training and we've extended it
 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.249
enter training and we've extended it
even a couple months after that so

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259
even a couple months after that so
 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:53.870
even a couple months after that so
technically it's the employee making

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880
technically it's the employee making
 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.449
technically it's the employee making
their own choice on whether this is the

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:56.459
their own choice on whether this is the
 

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:58.850
their own choice on whether this is the
right company for them and in Las Vegas

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860
right company for them and in Las Vegas

starting pay for a call center rep is
eleven dollars an hour there's plenty of

00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:02.429
eleven dollars an hour there's plenty of
 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:05.090
eleven dollars an hour there's plenty of
other call centers so two thousand

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100
other call centers so two thousand
 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.800
other call centers so two thousand
dollars is a pretty significant amount

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810
dollars is a pretty significant amount
 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.870
dollars is a pretty significant amount
of money so we want to make sure that we

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880
of money so we want to make sure that we
 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.160
of money so we want to make sure that we
get employees that are you really

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170
get employees that are you really
 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.449
get employees that are you really
believe in the long-term vision of the

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459
believe in the long-term vision of the
 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.180
believe in the long-term vision of the
company want to be part of that and

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190
company want to be part of that and
 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.830
company want to be part of that and
really believe that this is the company

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840
really believe that this is the company
 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.630
really believe that this is the company
that's right for them from a culture

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640
that's right for them from a culture
 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.120
that's right for them from a culture
perspective and you know we do

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130
perspective and you know we do
 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.340
perspective and you know we do
occasionally have people that take that

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350
occasionally have people that take that
 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.630
occasionally have people that take that
offer and I think it's actually a

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640
offer and I think it's actually a
 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.530
offer and I think it's actually a
win-win for both sides

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540
 
 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.630
 
so in late two thousand eight we had to

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640
so in late two thousand eight we had to
 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.150
so in late two thousand eight we had to
lay off about eight percent of our staff

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160
lay off about eight percent of our staff
 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.910
lay off about eight percent of our staff
and that was actually a pretty tough

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920
and that was actually a pretty tough
 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.710
and that was actually a pretty tough
thing to do we were we were actually

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720
thing to do we were we were actually
 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.780
thing to do we were we were actually
still growing year over year but this

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790
still growing year over year but this
 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.970
still growing year over year but this
was during the whole financial crisis

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980
was during the whole financial crisis
 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.370
was during the whole financial crisis
and and we had planned for much more

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380
and and we had planned for much more
 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.350
and and we had planned for much more
growth than we actually had and so we

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360
growth than we actually had and so we
 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.480
growth than we actually had and so we
had hired into that and then we realized

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490
had hired into that and then we realized
 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.430
had hired into that and then we realized
that we weren't going to be making our

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440
that we weren't going to be making our
 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.030
that we weren't going to be making our
numbers so we ended up laying off about

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040
numbers so we ended up laying off about
 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.449
numbers so we ended up laying off about
eight percent of our staff and but we

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459
eight percent of our staff and but we
 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.170
eight percent of our staff and but we
wanted to do it in a proactive way most

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180
wanted to do it in a proactive way most
 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.140
wanted to do it in a proactive way most
companies were waiting until they were

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150
companies were waiting until they were
 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.180
companies were waiting until they were
forced to lay off employees when they

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190
forced to lay off employees when they
 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.600
forced to lay off employees when they
couldn't make payroll anymore or they

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610
couldn't make payroll anymore or they
 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.220
couldn't make payroll anymore or they
would lay off employees and give them

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.710
would lay off employees and give them
maybe two weeks of severance for us we

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720
maybe two weeks of severance for us we
 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.360
maybe two weeks of severance for us we
want to make sure we took care of our

at least two months of severance and on
 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.590
at least two months of severance and on
top of that anyone that had worked with

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600
top of that anyone that had worked with
 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.740
top of that anyone that had worked with
the company for more than two years we

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750
the company for more than two years we
 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.600
the company for more than two years we
gave them one month for every year that

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610
gave them one month for every year that
 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.860
gave them one month for every year that
they worked at Zappos and then we also

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870
they worked at Zappos and then we also
 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.690
they worked at Zappos and then we also
covered their Cobra payments for six

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700
