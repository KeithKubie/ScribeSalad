00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.780
In order to think about starting to
understand color in a standard way,

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:06.060
experiments were done and

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.250
they started quite a long time ago,
where you'd do the following, right?

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.840
You would, you would make some
light coming into the observer, and

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.625
that would be some light
along that spectrum.

00:00:14.625 --> 00:00:19.000
So, the red, the green, the blue, etc.,
you'd have some pure spectral light.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.140
All right.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.350
And the observers job and here the
observers one great big eyeball which is

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.820
kind of creepy, but
there's actually a person sitting there,

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.840
would be to just adjust the amount
of red, green and blue light.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.440
And they were given a particular
type of red, green, and blue,

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.930
particular wavelength of light, and they
could put more or less of it, of each of

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.970
them to try to get it to match the test
light that was being produced.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.570
And most of the spectral
colors could be done this way.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.980
You could just add a certain amount of,
of that light.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:57.010
But, it turned out that some of
the colors couldn't be matched,

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:03.730
unless you actually added, a little bit
of red to the original test light, okay.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.250
That is, in some sense, in the mixture,
you had to sort of like have negative

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.083
red light and of course we
couldn't make negative red light.

00:01:10.083 --> 00:01:14.092
So what you would do is you would
sort of add some positive red light to

00:01:14.092 --> 00:01:14.958
the testing.

00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:18.706
So that's the first thing to
realize is that certain color,

00:01:18.706 --> 00:01:21.870
certain wavelengths in the spectrum.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.330
You would look at it and, you know,
for those particular three lights they

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.640
gave you, there was no blending of them
at all that would equal this color.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.990
And the way that gets expressed
is the following, right?

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.790
So here you were giving
a certain type of blue, green,

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.630
and red light and then depending upon
where you are in the wavelength, where

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.460
you are in the spectrum, depending upon
what single light I put out, all right?

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.950
You would have, this is how much red,
green, and blue you would need to add,

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.520
and you'll notice this
area here is the negative.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.930
These were the colors, okay?

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.050
These were the spectra that for
those particular red, green, and

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.820
blue lights that they gave you,
you couldn't make them match.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.780
So they represent that as
being sort of negative red.
