00:00:04.129 --> 00:00:07.969
yeah I started doing experiments in

00:00:07.969 --> 00:00:07.979
yeah I started doing experiments in
 

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:10.610
yeah I started doing experiments in
chemistry we never saw each of about 12

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620
chemistry we never saw each of about 12
 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.030

or 13 in she stays no computers were

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040
or 13 in she stays no computers were
 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.910
or 13 in she stays no computers were
available and I was always very bad in

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920
available and I was always very bad in
 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.359
available and I was always very bad in
sports so it was playing the piano so I

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369
sports so it was playing the piano so I
 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.920
sports so it was playing the piano so I
was interested in music but apart from

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930
was interested in music but apart from
 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.650
was interested in music but apart from
that I was interested in science that's

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660
that I was interested in science that's
 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.179
that I was interested in science that's
why i started with chemically

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189
why i started with chemically
 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.099
why i started with chemically
experiments i had a very wonderful book

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109
experiments i had a very wonderful book
 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.200
experiments i had a very wonderful book
called chemical experiments that work at

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210
called chemical experiments that work at
 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.790
called chemical experiments that work at
so i started to lose his experiments in

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800
so i started to lose his experiments in
 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.870
so i started to lose his experiments in
my bedroom but one day my mother said

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:37.880
my bedroom but one day my mother said
 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.330
my bedroom but one day my mother said
you should stop said it smells over ways

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340
you should stop said it smells over ways
 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.600

the morning you will not wake up anymore
 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.460
the morning you will not wake up anymore
and that's why I stopped chemical

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.470
and that's why I stopped chemical
 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.920
and that's why I stopped chemical
instrument experiments and moved into

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930
instrument experiments and moved into
 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.870
instrument experiments and moved into
physics whenever you solve a problem

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:53.880
physics whenever you solve a problem
 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.750

always need some some some fantasy to
imagine what could be the answer to this

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:04.800
imagine what could be the answer to this
 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.130
imagine what could be the answer to this
question yeah because in this defines a

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140
question yeah because in this defines a
 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.770

lion on work along which you are doing

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780
lion on work along which you are doing
 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.440
lion on work along which you are doing
your new research I think it's always an

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450
your new research I think it's always an
 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.260
your new research I think it's always an
adventure to ask a question and to enter

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270
adventure to ask a question and to enter
 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.660
adventure to ask a question and to enter
a new field where you don't know the

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670
a new field where you don't know the
 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.880
a new field where you don't know the
answer in advance and if you then get an

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890
answer in advance and if you then get an
 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.560
answer in advance and if you then get an
answer and if this answer is really

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570
answer and if this answer is really
 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.230
answer and if this answer is really
surprising this creates a great chair

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240
surprising this creates a great chair
 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.810
surprising this creates a great chair
joy always many many people approach you

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820
joy always many many people approach you

and want answers to questions you never
 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.920
and want answers to questions you never
had solved before it don't know quite

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930
had solved before it don't know quite

and you must be very careful with your
 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.340
and you must be very careful with your
answers pinned because they can be used

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350
answers pinned because they can be used
 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.149

retreat into my resort and then stay

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840
retreat into my resort and then stay
 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.230
retreat into my resort and then stay
there for week or so and just think

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240
there for week or so and just think
 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.350
there for week or so and just think
overall as a whole situation

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360
