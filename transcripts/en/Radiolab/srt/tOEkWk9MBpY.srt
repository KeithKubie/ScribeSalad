7
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:29,090
Hey, I'm Janet. Boom. Ryan. I'm Robert
Krulwich. This is radio lab this hour.

8
00:00:29,091 --> 00:00:32,600
Our topic is diagnosis. This
next story begins with a dad,

9
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:37,580
two sons and a question. What do you
do when you notice somebody different?

10
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:39,520
I heard it from reporter
to Gregory, right?

11
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:44,220
Hello. Hi Gregory. [inaudible] nice
to meet. Nice to meet you in case.

12
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,690
Just so you know, it took me over a year.

13
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:49,120
You can sit down and you to finally
get an interview with Byron France.

14
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:50,730
I'm wondering if the air,

15
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,320
I can turn the dead in their story and
I'm up in his apartment in the South

16
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,460
Bronx. You'll have skills, all
this loose paperwork. Are you just,

17
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,820
are you moving out or are you
moving? It looks bad. Look like that.

18
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,630
Was that messy? I don't want to put
this [inaudible] boxes everywhere.

19
00:01:06,631 --> 00:01:11,460
Crazy piles of stuff. Okay, let
go. Don't worry about [inaudible].

20
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:16,170
Yeah, sorry. [inaudible] it's in disarray.
There's who? So who is this gun? I A,

21
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:20,460
I'm a retired electrical engineer. I
work for subway most of his life now.

22
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:25,540
I consider myself a science
researcher and it's 71 years old.

23
00:01:25,801 --> 00:01:28,170
He's basically teaching
himself onto physics.

24
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,310
That's what all the books and stuff
you see around. I love that stuff.

25
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:35,430
And he's written this book
called Einstein's era,

26
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,790
criticizing special relativity. Einstein.

27
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,230
I sent it to the New York Academy
of Science at Caltech, MIT, Harvard,

28
00:01:43,231 --> 00:01:46,720
even Hawkins. Still waiting for him to
get back. Most people just ignore them.

29
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,340
These are the rabies of maniac. But then
he points to this letter on the wall.

30
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,990
Yeah. From Neil degrasse Tyson. I know
that name. This major scientist. Yes.

31
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:59,100
Ahead of the Hayden Planetarium
in Manhattan. Exactly.
Yes. Yeah. And it says,

32
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,580
how dare you. You're just an engineer

33
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,410
and he's beaming. You know why?
Why do you smile when, when,

34
00:02:07,411 --> 00:02:09,690
when you talk about that letter
from Neil degrasse Tyson,

35
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:14,480
because I know how
foolish it is. Einstein,

36
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:18,920
they didn't even want to read his
paper. He said, who is this guy up spot?

37
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,170
He just a patent examination clerk.

38
00:02:21,171 --> 00:02:26,171
And Bern Byron banners is a man
who's proud to go against the grain.

39
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,540
The what other people
do. I don't really do.

40
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:34,970
And that's especially true with how
he raised his son. So now a Gregory,

41
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,650
you're gonna do, uh, some kind of a story
on the manuals. Youngest son, right?

42
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:40,820
Emmanuel. Okay.

43
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:44,810
And that's why I'm here focusing to
question him about how he raised his son.

44
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,630
That'd be glad to. Okay,
great. So here's the manual.

45
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:51,220
Hi, I'm Emmanuel [inaudible]. Amanda,
could you take a drink of water for me?

46
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:55,870
Just okay. Thank you. No,
it don't take me. Yeah,

47
00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:00,690
take as many drinks of water. He's 28.
So what things are you good at? Manual,

48
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:01,320
um,

49
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:06,320
writing essays and making sure they
aren't grammatically correct bowling.

50
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:13,560
And as you can hear analyzing stuff,
there is something going on with them.

51
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,110
Um, and, and,

52
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,120
and not talking that much. Yes.

53
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:27,630
Now if you ask dad, he'll say manuals
and excellent student. Our Future,

54
00:03:27,631 --> 00:03:32,130
no balance. It's gonna win a Nobel prize.
You never know, but if you ask Blair,

55
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:35,160
I'm Blair frown or is that
Emmanuel's half-brother?

56
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,290
I'm about 20 years old and then Emmanuel,

57
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,860
he'll tell you that even as a little
kid, very, very like five years old.

58
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:43,890
There was something, oh, I didn't,
I just didn't know what it was.

59
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,050
It's a bunch of little things.

60
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,260
Yeah, like if you'd look
at you really weird,

61
00:03:47,261 --> 00:03:49,090
kind of like a doll face expression.

62
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:54,510
He could stare at me without blinking
for 15 minutes at a time and I would

63
00:03:55,241 --> 00:03:59,320
notice you didn't blink
once and there was a speech.

64
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:02,860
I did not talk as much as other people.

65
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:06,580
There was something going on with the
manual, but I did not have a word for it

66
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:12,540
and so I'm pushed several times to get
speech therapy, but every time he did,

67
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,430
dad would just say, are you kidding?

68
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,510
He may have troubled stumbling and
stammering, but he'll grow out of it.

69
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,500
I started to Blair. You
also started Einstein.

70
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:27,030
He didn't speak a word til he was six.
He was considered retarded in school.

71
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,500
He would say that this was some
temporary problem that would pass.

72
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:36,180
I didn't see anything that was, that
was screaming out for attention.

73
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,630
He was doing his work. He
was interested in the Knicks.

74
00:04:39,631 --> 00:04:44,631
We would go out endlessly in cold weather
to the park and it seemed like things

75
00:04:44,941 --> 00:04:47,070
were okay. What about Emmanuel?

76
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:51,500
Well, I knew that I was a nicer person,

77
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:53,690
a nicer person. Yay.

78
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,410
And then I was sent

79
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,590
[inaudible] I don't automatically
look at people in the eyes,

80
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,330
the face and stuff, you know.

81
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:12,160
So as long as Emmanuel was a little
kid, this wasn't such a big deal.

82
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,710
But then he got older,

83
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:18,790
he was around 10 years old and it was
that thing at the point where I'm on.

84
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:22,570
The people would point it
out. What did they say? Well,

85
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,420
I have been called, um,

86
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:29,740
returning and idiot savant,
the n word and stuff.

87
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,820
They lost the innocence
of the elementary school.

88
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,940
Emmanuel would come home with
bruises on his arms. Yeah. Yeah.

89
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:41,040
It was something that I constantly
thought about and worried about.

90
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:41,841
I said, yeah,

91
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,920
well it'd be really good for him
to get professional help with that.

92
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,910
Did you ask dad? He said the
problem wasn't a manual. No,

93
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:52,290
it was all the other people,
the bullies, the group

94
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,570
in this neighborhood. It was hard.

95
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,070
There was constant

96
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:01,790
fighting right down the street over
here. People involved with crack.

97
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:04,670
These are big guys, you know,

98
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:09,680
I felt that it could have been a
dangerous situation. So his solution,

99
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:13,940
I decided that I wanted to
teach you manual homeschool.

100
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:18,040
Pull his son out of school. Yeah. And
how do you feel about this at the time?

101
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:21,460
Well, I, I really didn't know.

102
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,630
Oh, up here. So we're
looking in the closet here.

103
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,750
I thought that whatever
way he's kind of turned in.

104
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:32,190
This is a binder from one of his classes
that if he got bullied and tormented

105
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:36,620
and going to school, that it would turn
him further in. Let's see what this is.

106
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,980
But that if he were here,

107
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:43,050
he could develop along his own line til
he became old enough that they wouldn't

108
00:06:43,051 --> 00:06:47,880
want to pick on him. Oh, look
what we turned to nature. Nurture.

109
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,600
It was a big deal for dad. You uh, hadn't

110
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,800
homeschooled anybody else before,
right? No. I had to get books.

111
00:06:55,801 --> 00:06:58,020
I had to go meet the
principal. He left his job,

112
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:03,300
submitted a curriculum to the school and
I had to register with the state of New

113
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,550
York, created this syllabus for his son,

114
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:08,570
great in integrated math course a lot.

115
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:11,670
And they would wake up each
morning rational numbers, geometry,

116
00:07:11,671 --> 00:07:15,480
do their lessons. Leslie's trying to
leak lateral, trying to have some lunch.

117
00:07:15,481 --> 00:07:19,410
This is the work that he did at home
and in the afternoon they'd go bowling.

118
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,633
Bowling

119
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,050
manual wasn't

120
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:23,883
awesome.

121
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:26,950
His Dad would videotape him.

122
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:30,390
Today is Tuesday, December

123
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:33,780
28 1993.

124
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,300
It's weird footage.

125
00:07:36,301 --> 00:07:38,910
It's weird to watch because the manual
is such an incredibly good, yeah.

126
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:45,830
Yeah. You took it out but beautiful
shot. He's always by himself.

127
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:53,410
Tape after tape of nothing but a
manual. Nobody else in the picture

128
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:59,170
I would fan to size about going on a
tour and winning some tiles and stuff.

129
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,900
Did you think about
joining any youth league?

130
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:10,480
Well, kind of. Well,

131
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,710
I vaguely don't about it, but um,

132
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,920
but for some reason my dad

133
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:20,583
didn't want me to

134
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:28,230
[inaudible].

135
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:32,400
Meanwhile his brother is just players
in Canada at a distance. Yeah.

136
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:37,460
He followed a girl there and one day he
picks a book off the shelf DSM and the

137
00:08:37,921 --> 00:08:42,921
DSM is the a diagdiagnosis
statistical manual mental disorders.

138
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:46,020
Okay. Then I started just to do,

139
00:08:46,021 --> 00:08:49,530
I guess what a lot of people would do
who could get ahold of this thing is to

140
00:08:49,531 --> 00:08:53,760
start diagnosing all of their
friends like diagnosed my girlfriend,

141
00:08:53,761 --> 00:08:56,280
I diagnosed my dad and

142
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,590
then I saw her right there in the page.

143
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,210
Marc's impairment in the use of multiple
nonverbal behaviors such as eye to eye

144
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:08,950
gaze, repetitive behavior patterns,
problem seeking, new friends, problem,

145
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:12,190
being able to understand what
someone must be thinking.

146
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:17,280
Problems have went down this whole list
and everything seemed to fit Martin

147
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,780
Pyramids and I, I gave this promise
every time he tried to call his dad.

148
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,550
What do you think his dad
would say? Just stop whining.

149
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,840
He'll just go through this and he shot
him out. You basically cut communication.

150
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,580
I know my son,

151
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:37,060
he would always tell me Dan,
whenever I hand would go,

152
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:41,980
we're way when I was in adult. What
does an adult mean? Does that mean 18?

153
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,660
Um, um, 20 meaning 20 lesson. Okay.

154
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:52,000
So he thought as soon as I reached
the age of 20 then I would have these

155
00:09:52,001 --> 00:09:53,140
problems. Yeah.

156
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:57,070
So did you wake up on your
20th birthday and think,

157
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:58,810
I thought they made me,

158
00:09:58,811 --> 00:10:02,380
things would change right away,

159
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,360
but they didn't. After that,

160
00:10:07,361 --> 00:10:12,190
a manual says he got really depressed
and that's how things might've stayed

161
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:14,703
until

162
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,880
[inaudible] heart attack.

163
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:24,570
Blair comes to the hospital,
finds dad unconscious on the bed,

164
00:10:24,571 --> 00:10:28,860
and he realizes this is my big chance
because he was not in a position to

165
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:30,450
intervene. And you're thinking,

166
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,330
I'm thinking the first thing that's
gonna happen is that we're going to get a

167
00:10:33,331 --> 00:10:36,000
diagnosis because we're waiting
for it for so many years,

168
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:40,710
26 or older or whatever it goes,
like 25 maybe he's going to get help.

169
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,080
You know? He's, he has to get
out mean here's the, okay,

170
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,320
2005 so where are we coming into now?

171
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:49,650
We're at 42nd Street Times Square

172
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,690
Time Square is one of Emanuel's
favorite areas to hang out.

173
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:57,780
And I figured I wanted to be
on his surf so they're outside.

174
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,950
The crowd is just beginning to arrive.

175
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:03,940
It was starting to snow a little
bit and rain some too. Yeah,

176
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,820
I think Blair turns to
management and he says, oh,

177
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,190
have you ever heard of [inaudible]

178
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:17,710
autism? I said,

179
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:23,050
I highly suspect that you have some form
of autism and I want us to find some

180
00:11:25,211 --> 00:11:26,800
way for you to get it diagnosed. Yes.

181
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,070
[inaudible]

182
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:35,430
oh, and I said six, don't
be the word it is today.

183
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:44,580
[inaudible] [inaudible]

184
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,100
Dr, how do I pronounce your
name? FDIC. Yeah. Agnostic.

185
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,760
And pretty soon after New Year's.
And where are you from? I'm awake.

186
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,920
Manual gets his diagnosis.
He goes right on this couch.

187
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:58,570
I did get the feeling from my beginning
of the interaction that he was going to

188
00:11:58,571 --> 00:12:02,830
meet criteria for autism. And a month
later she told me that I was on the

189
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,640
autistic spectrum. It was official.

190
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:14,050
Um, okay. Football. Uh, wait.

191
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,280
And so at the age of 26,

192
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,970
finally [inaudible] his
life completely changed.

193
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:27,070
So I gave him a tape recorder to
record his life. Hello with me venue.

194
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:31,570
He's meeting with his speech pathologist
a couple of hours a week also.

195
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:36,330
He's joined this program [inaudible]
and started making friends. Oh, do I say

196
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:43,010
hello? Hey Jason. Peace
out. Got a girlfriend. Yeah.

197
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:45,430
Hey, it's me, Emmanuel. One second again.

198
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:51,070
And there's one lady that I
haven't talked about your name,

199
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,233
Norma.

200
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:58,420
And we went to central park and
we took pitches and it was great.

201
00:12:58,850 --> 00:12:59,421
But I always say,

202
00:12:59,421 --> 00:13:02,700
I thought that people who are
diagnosed with autism don't this,

203
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:05,240
the definition is they
don't want to socialize.

204
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:08,150
Well ms not because I know do want to,

205
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:13,040
but [inaudible] this
is hard to do. He know.

206
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:17,300
But here's the thing about a manual.
He's had this whole new life.

207
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:22,720
He hasn't told dad about any of it.
Hello Haney thing, not the girl,

208
00:13:22,721 --> 00:13:27,220
the friends, the diagnosis. His Dad
doesn't know anything's different.

209
00:13:27,221 --> 00:13:28,990
So how long have you
been keeping it a secret?

210
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:33,160
It's been since 2005. Right? Yeah.

211
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,050
So basically for the last two years,

212
00:13:35,051 --> 00:13:39,490
a manual has been leading this double
life outside. He's a person with autism,

213
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:44,410
then he comes home.
Nothing's wrong. Why? Well,

214
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:49,180
I'm just afraid in the anyone, um, really,

215
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,990
um, believe in,

216
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:56,610
but he knows he's gotta tell his dad
who he really is and he keeps saying he

217
00:13:56,951 --> 00:13:57,784
will

218
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,130
lemme say within a month soon.

219
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:03,070
I'm not quite sure we can,

220
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:07,700
I am a little bit nervous about
telling him about my ass spot.

221
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:12,700
Maybe within a few minutes or so. Let
me tell him in like two weeks or so.

222
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,920
[inaudible] I mind to tell
him Matha I mean Blair

223
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:20,340
[inaudible] well tomorrow
maybe one or no yet.

224
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:23,890
I'm just thinking about it a
little bit too much. I don't know.

225
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,730
And then finally one night,

226
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:32,220
I just want to say that I told him

227
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:40,610
[inaudible] I said I really have something
important to say and don't get angry.

228
00:14:41,521 --> 00:14:46,521
And then I told him that I was diagnosed
with Asperger's syndrome and he asked

229
00:14:48,481 --> 00:14:52,250
me what it was and then I
told him is high functioning

230
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:53,180
autism?

231
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,050
Uh, I was shocked

232
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:03,240
that w that would be a good way to put
it. So do you think he has Asperger's?

233
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:07,480
Yes. Yes I do.

234
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:13,410
When I look at this syndrome
for a lot good parts of it,

235
00:15:13,631 --> 00:15:14,470
it's e manual,

236
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:20,610
but I never at any point felt that
that he manual was in need of any deep

237
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:24,910
psychological or psych psychiatric help.

238
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,133
But

239
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,870
I mean, what makes you
qualified to say that?

240
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:34,250
Just being a loving parent
as I'm talking to him,

241
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:38,900
we're sitting there on the couches in
front of us on the coffee table is all of

242
00:15:38,901 --> 00:15:43,760
the manuals, notebooks from age five
onward and they're really good stuff.

243
00:15:43,761 --> 00:15:46,820
I mean it's stuff that you and I
would write and he saved it all.

244
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:51,440
But the question that I feel like I
got to ask her and I just have one more

245
00:15:51,441 --> 00:15:54,780
question on my list if I
can ask you that one is, um,

246
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:57,500
now that you know that there is
something wrong with your son,

247
00:15:57,501 --> 00:16:00,950
that there always was this
disorder, that it's incurable.

248
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,620
Do you think you did
the right thing? So d,

249
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:07,410
do you wish that he had gotten
the diagnosis earlier? No,

250
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:12,960
because I think that he's better
off at this point in time.

251
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,470
Why wouldn't it make a
difference to know earlier?

252
00:16:16,471 --> 00:16:19,290
What's why you're acting so strangely.

253
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:24,470
I didn't want he manual to get a
diagnosis that would put him in a box,

254
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:29,570
like a label. And then dad
says to me, remember, look,

255
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:33,290
I mean if I had let the school
give him some kind of diagnosis,

256
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:36,590
they would've thrown him in special
ed and say, oh, he's a retard. Look.

257
00:16:36,591 --> 00:16:38,840
He can't even talk. I mean,
that would've destroyed them.

258
00:16:38,841 --> 00:16:42,050
They would cause irreparable damage.

259
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:44,300
I asked the doctor was
there any truth to them?

260
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:46,790
If a manual was put into
special Ed, hypothetically,

261
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:48,680
he wasn't a district seven to five class.

262
00:16:48,681 --> 00:16:52,310
The technical word for special ed would
not have raised his academic potential.

263
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:57,650
He, he said graduate from St
John's with a degree in psychology.

264
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:02,480
Kids who graduate district 75 don't do
that. Just to put that in perspective,

265
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:07,730
Emmanuel comes from a neighborhood where
about 10% of the kids ever graduate

266
00:17:07,731 --> 00:17:12,140
college. And my GPA was
like 3.4 and change.

267
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:16,160
Wow. And he's got Asperger's. So
now we're kind of in the opposite.

268
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:19,610
We're kind of vindicating really
what his father did. Right.

269
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:23,750
Weight in terms of his
academic achievement. His
father did the right thing.

270
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,090
The problem with his dad's choice,

271
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:30,350
and he had no way of knowing at the
time was the lack of peer groups,

272
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:35,120
what team he stamped on. It seems like
a cruel choice, but [inaudible] choice.

273
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:40,160
So if you were your father and you
were raising your kid at that time,

274
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,410
would you have made the same
choice? He did? Um, well couldn't.

275
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:49,650
Well, if I had known what I

276
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:51,763
known now,

277
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:57,250
then maybe I would have maybe
back Tim a little more for me.

278
00:17:58,731 --> 00:18:03,620
You get to interact with others
who were like, I am cool.

279
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:04,723
Or like I am

280
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:19,403
[inaudible] [inaudible]

281
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:22,360
that story from our
correspondent, Gregory Warner.

282
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,610
Craig's reporting is
made possible in part by

283
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:27,491
the Rosalyn Carter Fellowship
for Mental Health Journalism.

284
00:18:27,491 --> 00:18:31,450
Thanks to them and thank you to Lulu
Miller for producing that piece.

285
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:33,400
We will continue in a moment.
