[folk music]

00:00:07.508 --> 00:00:09.076
- WHY DO I LOVE DETROIT?

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:10.577
BECAUSE IT'S LAWLESS.

00:00:10.611 --> 00:00:13.547
[stammers]
AND YOU, AND--AND YOU KNOW,

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.582
IT MAYBE COME AROUND
TO BITE YOUR ASS IN THE ASS,

00:00:15.616 --> 00:00:17.150
'CAUSE YOUR WINDOW
GOT BROKEN OUT

00:00:17.184 --> 00:00:18.719
AND THAT SUCKS,
AND IT DOES,

00:00:18.752 --> 00:00:20.254
AND YOU GO THROUGH
SOME HARD TIMES.

00:00:20.287 --> 00:00:21.755
BUT THE LAWLESSNESS
IS GREAT,

00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:23.457
'CAUSE YOU CAN JUST
RIDE YOUR BIKE TO WORK

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.425
DRINKING A BEER,
JUST LIKE YOU'RE IN NEW ORLEANS,

00:00:25.459 --> 00:00:26.460
WHERE YOU'RE ALLOWED TO.

00:00:26.493 --> 00:00:28.495
BUT YOU CAN DO THAT HERE TOO.

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.063
IT'S OFF THE CHAIN.
IT'S GONNA BE AMAZING.

00:00:30.097 --> 00:00:31.098
I LOVE MICHIGAN.

00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:33.200
MICHIGAN, THAT'S WHAT'S UP.

00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:34.501
EVERYONE IN DETROIT,

00:00:34.535 --> 00:00:37.004
JUDAS PRIEST IS BETTER
THAN IRON MAIDEN,

00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:37.104
AND IRON MAIDEN
IS THE [bleep].
