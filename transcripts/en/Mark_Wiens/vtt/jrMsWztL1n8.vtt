00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.000
Hey, everyone. Hope you're having a fantastic day! It's Mark Wiens in Tokyo, Japan.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:12.740
For lunch today, I'm on my way to go eat one of the spiciest, most, like firery bowls of ramen in all of Tokyo and

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.070
it actually looks like

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.500
dangerously spicy. It's so red. I'm a little bit nervous, and I can't wait to taste it

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.200
Just arrived at the restaurant. This is the spot right here.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.600
Okay! Thank you!

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.880
Okay, buy your ticket first?

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:34.380
Okay

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:42.180
What's cool about this ramen shop is they have both Chili Pepper level and Sichuan Pepper level. So you get none, less, medium, high,

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.240
and Devil level. You can get Devil level of both the Chili Pepper and Sichuan Pepper.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.600
I gotta go Devil level.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.760
Come on in. So it's a vending machine access so you get your ticket

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.740
And then you give your ticket to them and then you get your bowl of Ramen. I'm gonna go for the Deluxe

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.500
Deluxe Ramen

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.320
Yeah, Deluxe Ramen, and gotta go Devil level on everything.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.560
And this one Devil Level.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:11.700
Devil Level?

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.740
Yeah. Devil Level

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.600
Devel level, take money. 100 more

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:24.100
Okay, more. more? Extra. Yeah, extra, both is devil? yes. 200 yen. okay.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:32.239
Actually I had pay 200 extra yen to get the devil level of both sichuan pepper and spice

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.600
And they're actually all full of seats right now

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:42.000
So we got to wait a little while until there's some empty seats, and then we're going to try out this extraordinarily Spicy Ramen in tokyo

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.829
That was just a few minutes wait and we are now in the restaurant

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.120
This is kind of a dark dungeon cave feeling restaurant. It has a

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.160
Devil theme to it as well so it's black and red, and then there are little devil

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.359
statues all around. It's kind of like a

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:07.860
Foreshadowing of spicy ramen doom and what's also cool is that they give you to give you a bib for this ramen

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.399
oh yes, I have to. I have to use it.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.460
how do we tie this thing up?

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.910
Alright

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.610
I'm ready to do this

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.080
I just got my bowl of Ramen and if you order most of the other bowls of noodles and the different levels of spicy they

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.956
Give you your

00:03:00.956 --> 00:03:02.089
Ramen in a white Bowl

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.319
But if you order the devil level they give it to you in a special Black Bowl

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.549
And this is... it not only looks dangerously spicy, but it's beautiful

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.509
They just have like giant chunks of chashu in there, there's egg

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:20.480
There's corn. There's green onions, and the spice is literally like just caked up on top of it

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.259
You can see that that freshly ground sichuan pepper there. You can see the fresh chili powder

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:31.160
Wow, it's just like thick with spice. I gotta just taste that broth first. Look at that, that just looks like solid Lava.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.350
Wow, oh yeah, that has some heat to it. That's like taking a bite of open flame.

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.910
oh but not only is it spicy, but it's extremely flavorful and

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.019
Immediately that sichuan pepper hits me nicely

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:57.769
It's so citrusy you can just smell that incredible aroma of the Sichuan pepper. That was quite a lot of

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.679
Sichuan pepper on that first bite. I think you need to stir that around

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:09.199
There are bean sprouts in here as well. There's a whole egg, and there's corn as well

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:26.449
Oh that's flaming hot. On that first bite actually the Chili is not that strong, but the sichuan pepper is incredibly strong

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.630
That just like tingles all the way down your throat.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.440
And it's almost a little bit difficult to speak actually

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.590
Okay now for that chunk of pork and it is huge

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:51.659
Wow, it's so fatty and so tender and it has a little bit of a sweetness to it, too

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.120
Okay, I'm going in for that egg

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:03.520
Oh yeah

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:09.210
For some reason I was expecting it to be like a fully hard-boiled egg, but definitely not, it has that runny

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:13.499
oozy yolk that is amazing and the egg white is

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:21.689
Sort of like has that slight rubberiness to it. So far this bowl of ramen, the chili is completely fine

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.500
But the sichuan pepper is what's really intense

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.530
actually my entire mouth and

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:34.409
throat and like esophagus is just tingling and numb right now

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:40.020
It is an amazing feeling, but that is a lot of sichuan pepper that they put in here

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:42.659
But the flavor is just outstanding

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:48.599
Just look at that pork again. I love how they just have like a slab of pork in here

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:56.500
Oh look at that. That's just effortless chewing. No no Ying

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:01.259
It's super super hot. Like, it's so sichuan, that I can barely, like, talk.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.020
And you just tried the broth

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:16.049
No, the chili is not bad but the sichuan, is what's really intense. Wow that sichuan pepper.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:23.519
It's so sensational. I love sichuan pepper so much, but this is like to the point, where you almost can't control your mouth

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:36.319
You know when you eat ramen, it's customary to slurp the noodles, but I think it would actually be dangerous to slurp these noodles

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:41.209
Some of those chilies, some of that sichuan pepper could just go down the wrong pipe, that's for sure

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:48.259
Oh wow, that chashu is just insane though

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:58.730
It's hard to control my mouth right now

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:06.979
I'm getting some tears. I'm getting down to the bottom of the noodles. There's still a giant pork of...

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:13.970
I can't even speak right now. There's still a giant chunk of pork and half an egg, oh man

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:23.360
Got one big chunk, look at the size of that piece of meat and actually this piece of meat, you would think that

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:25.610
You need a steak knife to chop it up

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:30.050
It's almost like daunting to look at it like this, but then when you take a bite of it

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:32.749
It's just amazing how it just falls apart in your mouth

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.960
It just falls apart

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:46.969
And even though I can't feel anything in my mouth. I can feel the tenderness at that pork

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:52.280
You gotta keep up your endurance, it's pretty intense I'm starting to burp sichuan chili Pepper

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.870
Okay, I've reached my final bite

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:04.200
Wow. I don't think I'm gonna lick out this Bowl

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:08.570
But I am at the bottom. I can fully see the devils on the side of the Bowl

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:12.470
mission accomplished.

00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:22.759
A tissue is stuck to my cup, and I don't even mind

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.400
Arigato

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:33.590
Arigato, thank you very much

00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:36.259
Thank you, that was amazing.

00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:41.839
I forgot to take off my bib. Arigato, it's okay.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.340
Thank you.

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:46.790
Thank you very much, arigato.

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:50.730
Oh, I can't feel my mouth

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:58.200
I'm almost a little bit dizzy, partly because it's such a dark like Dungeon environment and just because of that sichuan chili

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:05.389
flavor that's just like feels like it's covering my body right now. Oh, man. That was intense.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:09.770
For me, the Chili level, the Devil level Chili was fine

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:11.570
I didn't find it that spicy

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:17.600
But what really like got me and what really almost did me, was that sichuan pepper, the devil level sichuan pepper.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:22.420
From your first bite, your throat just goes into like a

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:28.400
Like complete tingling sensation like imagine like you're drinking the most fizzy

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:33.709
Soda that you've ever had, like ten times strength fizzy soda

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:38.269
And it just like tingles throughout your whole insides, and that's what it's like

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:45.319
But the flavor was amazing, those chunks of chashu were incredible, the actual ramen itself is incredible

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:49.160
It's mind-blowing flavor, so even if you don't get the devil level

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:52.249
I don't know if I'd recommend the devil level sichuan pepper definitely

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:58.980
Probably not, but you go lower levels, the flavor of the Ramen is still incredibly good and

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:02.860
Also, shout out to all the whole crew here. They're all really nice,

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:04.980
and very friendly and welcoming

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:10.350
And one more thing if you finish your devil level they give you a little mint to eat after you're done

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:14.129
And it has a little, is that a little devil face on it.

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.500
This is awesome, limited Edition

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.880
