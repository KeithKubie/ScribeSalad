00:00:01.267 --> 00:00:03.536
&gt;&gt; I'd now like to
introduce Ian Glasner,

00:00:03.536 --> 00:00:05.638 line:92%
President of the Student Body.

00:00:05.638 --> 00:00:08.707
Ian is graduating today with
a double major in electrical

00:00:08.707 --> 00:00:11.010
and computer engineering
and business.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.511 line:92%
Please join me in welcoming him.

&gt;&gt; Ian Glasner: Challenge.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.067
If I could describe my Carnegie
Mellon experience in one word,

00:00:35.067 --> 00:00:37.670 line:92%
it would be challenge.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.307
When I say challenge,
I'm not simply talking

00:00:41.307 --> 00:00:45.044
about the first computer
engineering exam I took freshman

00:00:45.044 --> 00:00:48.114
year, I am actually
more so referring

00:00:48.114 --> 00:00:50.316
to the subsequent
phone call I had

00:00:50.316 --> 00:00:53.018
to give my mom telling
her that I failed.

00:00:54.553 --> 00:00:57.156
Things didn't exactly
start off as planned.

00:00:57.156 --> 00:01:00.059 line:92%
At the time, it felt

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.296
like Carnegie Mellon had
completely knocked me over.

00:01:04.296 --> 00:01:09.468
But we've all learned things
here, like that 0% chance

00:01:09.468 --> 00:01:12.438
of rain really means the weather
forecaster is just hoping it

00:01:12.438 --> 00:01:14.340 line:92%
doesn't rain.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.042
Those days usually
end with muddy shoes

00:01:17.042 --> 00:01:19.845
and a soaking wet
backpack, or that counting

00:01:19.845 --> 00:01:22.748
on a Pittsburgh bus to show
up on time is a great way

00:01:22.748 --> 00:01:26.051 line:92%
to be very, very late.

00:01:26.051 --> 00:01:28.954
By knocking us over, Carnegie
Mellon has taught us how

00:01:28.954 --> 00:01:32.491
to get back up and
sometimes getting back

00:01:32.491 --> 00:01:36.629
up involves drinking a Red
Bull or several cups of coffee

00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:39.098
in the basement of
a library alone

00:01:39.098 --> 00:01:41.534 line:92%
at 2:00 a.m. on a Saturday.

00:01:48.574 --> 00:01:52.044 line:92%
We've all be there.

00:01:52.044 --> 00:01:54.180 line:92%
We've all learned.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.050
I hope everyone brought
an umbrella today.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.020
Everyone here today has hit
a bump in the last four years

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.722
and we've all gotten
back up after.

00:02:03.722 --> 00:02:08.894
CMU has been a challenge, but
class of 2015, we made it.

00:02:08.894 --> 00:02:10.396 line:92%
Look around.

00:02:10.396 --> 00:02:14.133
In less than 90 minutes,
we will all be graduates

00:02:14.133 --> 00:02:15.501 line:92%
of Carnegie Mellon University.

00:02:25.711 --> 00:02:28.280
Today, I would like to
share with you the first

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.449
of many incredible
achievements I hope

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:34.153
that our class will
have as alumni.

00:02:34.153 --> 00:02:37.056
The board of trustees challenged
our class to make a senior gift

00:02:37.056 --> 00:02:41.627
to campus, something similar
to the Class of 1987 Room

00:02:41.627 --> 00:02:46.298
in the Cohon University Center,
but it's easier said than done.

00:02:46.298 --> 00:02:51.103
Asking college students to make
a donation is a tough sell,

00:02:51.103 --> 00:02:54.240
considering many of us
have borderline or not

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.209
so borderline negative
bank accounts.

00:02:58.577 --> 00:03:01.780
The Class of 2013
gave at a rate of 6%

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.651
and last year seniors
gave at a rate of 15%.

00:03:05.651 --> 00:03:10.089
Today, I'd like to announce
that more than 432 members

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:12.258 line:92%
of our class contributed.

00:03:12.258 --> 00:03:14.493 line:92%
That's well over 30%.

00:03:22.434 --> 00:03:23.702 line:92%
It's more than double last year

00:03:23.702 --> 00:03:26.105
and it's an all-time
record for Carnegie Mellon.

00:03:26.105 --> 00:03:35.180
In a few days, we will be
spread out across the country

00:03:36.315 --> 00:03:39.818
and the world just like
we were four years ago.

00:03:39.818 --> 00:03:42.321
Let's not make this the
last time we are all

00:03:42.321 --> 00:03:44.390 line:92%
in Pittsburgh together.

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.092
Five, ten, 50 years
down the road,

00:03:47.092 --> 00:03:49.161
remember Carnegie
Mellon University,

00:03:49.161 --> 00:03:53.432
remember where you learned how
to get back up and keep going.

00:03:53.432 --> 00:03:55.668 line:92%
So long, Class of 2015.

00:03:55.668 --> 00:03:58.771
May your futures be bright and
your hearts forever in the work

00:03:58.771 --> 00:03:59.772 line:92%
that we all did here together.

00:03:59.772 --> 00:04:00.472 line:92%
Thank you.
