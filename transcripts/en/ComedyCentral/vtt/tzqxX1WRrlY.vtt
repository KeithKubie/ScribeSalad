00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.603
I've got one more surprise
for everyone.

00:00:03.636 --> 00:00:08.374
My wife baked a batch
of her famous

00:00:08.407 --> 00:00:12.712
ooey-gooey butterballs
for the office.

[ All murmuring ]

00:00:12.745 --> 00:00:14.047
Take one and just

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.515
kind of pass it around.

00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:17.183
You are gonna get messy because
these are no joke.

00:00:17.216 --> 00:00:18.718
Christian: John.

00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:20.720
Enough.

00:00:20.753 --> 00:00:23.222
Your wife's
ooey-gooey butterballs

00:00:23.255 --> 00:00:24.791
can wait until
after the meeting.

00:00:24.824 --> 00:00:27.326 size:75% position:38%
I'm so sorry, Christian.
So sorry.

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.195 size:63% position:31%
But don't worry,
everyone,

00:00:29.228 --> 00:00:31.164 size:66% position:33%
they're even gooey-er
when you wait.

And back to Christian.

00:00:35.267 --> 00:00:39.338
Now, what I was about
to say was

00:00:39.371 --> 00:00:43.309
I bought BNN.

00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:52.552
It was a $10 billion deal.

00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:54.087
The media said it was
impossible.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.189
Congress said
it was "illegal."

00:00:56.222 --> 00:01:00.093
But through sheer force of will,
I made it happen.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.336
Okay, then.

00:01:13.706 --> 00:01:16.776
John, go ahead and, uh,

00:01:16.809 --> 00:01:18.778
pass out your wife's
little treats.

00:01:18.811 --> 00:01:20.313 align:start size:63% position:38%
Yes, sir. [ Laughs ]

00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:21.814 size:63% position:69%
All right, everyone,
come and get it.

00:01:21.847 --> 00:01:24.250 size:72% position:64%
Now, warning, these are
extremely gooey.

00:01:24.283 --> 00:01:27.749 align:end position:100%
One of these is vegan.
I couldn't tell you which one.
