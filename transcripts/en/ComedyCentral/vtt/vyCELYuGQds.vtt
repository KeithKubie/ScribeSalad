00:00:01.634 --> 00:00:03.936
We are here at the High
Cotton Brewing Company.

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:06.305
And I'm sitting in front of
some very talented comedians.

00:00:06.338 --> 00:00:08.241
And I'm excited to talk--

00:00:08.274 --> 00:00:13.846
Latoya, Jon Bratsveen, Mo
Alexander, and my man, Cleatis.

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:16.783
Is the comedy scene here in
Memphis, is it a big scene?

00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:17.884
Yeah.

00:00:17.917 --> 00:00:21.187
From when I first
started here at a club,

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.122
the independent
comedy scene came up.

00:00:23.155 --> 00:00:25.324
And it's-- you can book--
there's like open mics

00:00:25.357 --> 00:00:26.626
almost every night of the week.

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:28.594
So when you say independent,
you mean self-made rooms?

00:00:28.627 --> 00:00:29.395
Self-made rooms?

00:00:29.428 --> 00:00:30.830
Yeah.

00:00:30.863 --> 00:00:32.465
Some of the-- some of the young
comics came up and decided,

00:00:32.498 --> 00:00:33.332
they couldn't get
on at the club.

00:00:33.365 --> 00:00:34.934
So they started their own stuff.

00:00:34.967 --> 00:00:35.968
And now that's-- that's it.

00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:36.936
It's booming.

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:38.337
Things are going well.
- Yeah.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.206
As a younger guy here, have
you found a lot of success

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:41.074
by circulating those room?

00:00:41.107 --> 00:00:42.508
Oh, yeah.

00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:44.577
I mean I'm out there almost
every night of the week

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.611
that I can be.

00:00:45.644 --> 00:00:47.046
I'm just hitting
every room that I can,

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:48.448
and asking for time anywhere.

00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:50.716
Because I feel like, why turn
down any sort of stage time?

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:51.918
I like it.

00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:53.319
Do you feel like it's a
diverse group of people?

00:00:53.352 --> 00:00:55.121 line:0%
White comics stay on midtown,

00:00:55.154 --> 00:00:56.322 line:0%
and the black comics
[inaudible].

00:00:56.355 --> 00:00:58.291 line:0%
I think that-- you know,
I go to the white comics.

00:00:58.324 --> 00:00:59.926 line:0%
I think we could
benefit if we would--

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:01.961
we-- we have the same goal.

00:01:01.994 --> 00:01:03.563
I remember when
I was starting out,

00:01:03.596 --> 00:01:06.399
the one thing that I wanted to
do was perform for everybody,

00:01:06.432 --> 00:01:07.433
you know.

00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:08.701
And I think maybe
you guys should just

00:01:08.734 --> 00:01:11.370
try to take some steps
into diversifying the rules

00:01:11.403 --> 00:01:12.438
that you guys have out here.

00:01:12.471 --> 00:01:14.040
Because ultimately
we're doing the one

00:01:14.073 --> 00:01:15.808
thing that everybody needs.

00:01:15.841 --> 00:01:17.844
That's it, providing laughter.

00:01:17.877 --> 00:01:19.112
What do you want out of comedy?

00:01:19.145 --> 00:01:21.914
What's the ultimate
goal for you?

00:01:21.947 --> 00:01:23.683
To take you off your spot.

00:01:23.716 --> 00:01:24.817
That's a good goal.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.252
If you want to shoot
for it, shoot for it.

00:01:26.285 --> 00:01:28.154
Cleatis, what's that goal, man?

00:01:28.187 --> 00:01:29.422 line:0%
I'm going to be
honest with you, man.

00:01:29.455 --> 00:01:30.990 line:0%
I'm trying to get
high paid around here.

00:01:31.023 --> 00:01:31.891 line:0%
You know what I'm saying?

00:01:31.924 --> 00:01:33.359 line:0%
Because a lot of
you all, though,

00:01:33.392 --> 00:01:34.494
always, I'm trying to get rich.

00:01:34.527 --> 00:01:35.828
I'm trying to-- you
know, that stage time,

00:01:35.861 --> 00:01:37.964
that's my gift to the world.

00:01:37.997 --> 00:01:40.766
Like, when I make people
laugh, the feeling I get back

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:41.801
is enough for me.
- Gotcha.

00:01:41.834 --> 00:01:43.336
Now all I need is the money.

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:44.670
KEVIN HART: You just need the
money to match that feeling?

00:01:44.703 --> 00:01:45.838
Right, right.

00:01:45.871 --> 00:01:47.173
You need the money to
catch up to the feeling?

00:01:47.206 --> 00:01:48.341
Right, right.

00:01:48.374 --> 00:01:49.408
The money and the feeling
need to go together.

00:01:49.441 --> 00:01:51.944
Look, I mean this
show is the first step

00:01:51.977 --> 00:01:53.079
to more steps to come.

00:01:53.112 --> 00:01:54.514
And tonight is about
you making people

00:01:54.547 --> 00:01:58.347
understand that there's talent
here in Memphis, Tennessee.
