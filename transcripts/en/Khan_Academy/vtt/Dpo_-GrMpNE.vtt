00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:06.030
Use a calculator to
find log base e of 67

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.170
to the nearest thousandth.

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.440
So just as a reminder, e is
one of these crazy numbers

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.640
that shows up in nature, in
finance, and all these things,

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.900
and it's approximately
equal to 2.71

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.670
and it just keeps
going on and on and on.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.150
So you could view
log base e as 67.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.400
Let's see, what does e
mean? e is just a number,

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.800
just like pi is just a number.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.289
So this is really the same
thing as saying log base 2.71,

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.830
and the actual
numbers, so you'd have

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.290
to write all the digits
that keep on going forever

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.220
and never repeat 6 of 67.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.240
So what power do I have to
raise e to to get to 67?

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.170
So another way of saying
that is this is equal to x.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.340
You're saying e to
the x is equal to 67,

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.720
we need to figure out what x is.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.620
Now, traditionally
you will never

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.960
see someone write log
base e even though e

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.340
is one of the most common
bases to take a logarithm of.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.030
And so the reason why you
wouldn't see log base e written

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.220
this way is log
base e is referred

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.480
to as the natural logarithm.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.640
And I think that's used because
e shows up so many times

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.680
in nature.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.464
So log base e of 67, another
way of saying that-- or seeing

00:01:16.464 --> 00:01:18.130
that, and the more
typical way of seeing

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.800
that is the natural log.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.780
And I think this
is ln, so I think

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.720
it's maybe from French or
something, log natural, of 67.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.530
So this is the same thing
as log base e of 67.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.320
This is saying the
exact same thing.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.230
To what power do I have
to raise e to to get 67?

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.284
When you see this ln, it
literally means log base e.

00:01:40.284 --> 00:01:41.700
Now, they let us
use a calculator,

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.660
and that's good because I don't
know off the top of my head

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.630
what power I have to raise
2.71 so on and so forth-- what

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.810
power I have to raise
that to to get to 67.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.050
So we'll get our calculator out.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.882
So we get the TI85 out.

00:01:55.882 --> 00:01:57.340
And different
calculators will have

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.500
different ways of doing it.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.620
If you have a graphing
calculator like this,

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.710
you literally can literally type
in the statement natural log

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.600
of 67 then evaluate it.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.670
So here this is
the button for ln,

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.830
means natural log,
log natural, maybe.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.951
ln of 67, and then
you press Enter,

00:02:13.951 --> 00:02:15.200
and it'll give you the answer.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.866
If you don't have a
graphing calculator,

00:02:16.866 --> 00:02:20.749
you might have to press 67
and then press natural log

00:02:20.749 --> 00:02:22.790
to give you the answer,
but a graphing calculator

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.331
can literally type it in the
way that you would write it out,

00:02:25.331 --> 00:02:26.630
and then you would press Enter.

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.780
So 4.20469 and we want to round
to the nearest thousandth.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.140
So this is the thousandths
place right here, this 4.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.090
The digit after that is
5 or larger, it's a 6,

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.310
so we're going to round up.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.680
So this is 4.205.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:49.589
So this is approximately
equal to 4.205.

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:51.130
And it actually
makes a lot of sense,

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.250
because we know that
e is greater than 2,

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.430
and it is less than 3.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.320
And if you think about
what 2 to the fourth power

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.270
gets you to 16.

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.040
And 3 to the fourth
power gets you to 81.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.270
67 is between 16 and 81
and e is between 2 and 3.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.540
So at least it
feels right that's

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.120
something that's like
2.71 to the little

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.170
over the fourth power should
get you to a number that's

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.872
pretty close to 3
to the fourth power.

00:03:23.872 --> 00:03:25.830
Actually that makes sense
because it's actually

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.300
closer to 3.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.380
2.71 is closer to
3 than it is to 2.

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.780
So this feels right, that
you take this to the fourth,

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.320
little over the fourth
power, you get to 67.
