3.1415926535 I'm Jacob
Barandes this is my daughter Sadie this is pi

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.340
Pi is a magical number because it appears to
be written into the architecture of

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.050
logic of the universe itself shows up
all over mathematics and physics and

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.800
other areas of the sciences it is
irrational meaning it cannot be written

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.670
as a whole number divided by a whole
number but it's beyond irrational it's

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.640
actually a transcendental irrational
number it is not the solution to any

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.329
algebraic equation you can write down
with a finite number of terms and people

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.680
have been fascinated by pi for centuries
and we still are

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:55.440
... 1... um... um... 6402862... 342117067

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:00.440
All right let me

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.460
make sure it's right say
help me out okay, 0348

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.260
