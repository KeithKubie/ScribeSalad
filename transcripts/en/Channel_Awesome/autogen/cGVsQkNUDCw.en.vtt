00:11:30.819 --> 00:11:30.829 align:start position:0%
agree whether it's one of these things
 

00:11:30.829 --> 00:11:33.430 align:start position:0%
agree whether it's one of these things
is<00:11:31.070><c> not</c><00:11:31.100><c> like</c><00:11:31.370><c> you</c><00:11:31.850><c> not</c><00:11:32.240><c> magic</c><00:11:32.720><c> it</c><00:11:32.839><c> did</c><00:11:32.990><c> not</c><00:11:33.110><c> fit</c>

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
is not like you not magic it did not fit
 

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:36.220 align:start position:0%
is not like you not magic it did not fit
um<00:11:33.850><c> so</c><00:11:34.850><c> yeah</c><00:11:35.389><c> I</c><00:11:35.449><c> will</c><00:11:35.690><c> agree</c><00:11:35.839><c> that</c><00:11:35.930><c> those</c>

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:36.230 align:start position:0%
um so yeah I will agree that those
 

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:38.949 align:start position:0%
um so yeah I will agree that those
didn't<00:11:36.589><c> quite</c><00:11:36.860><c> go</c><00:11:37.670><c> together</c><00:11:37.820><c> I</c><00:11:38.269><c> don't</c><00:11:38.630><c> think</c>

00:11:38.949 --> 00:11:38.959 align:start position:0%
didn't quite go together I don't think
 

00:11:38.959 --> 00:11:40.240 align:start position:0%
didn't quite go together I don't think
that<00:11:39.079><c> was</c><00:11:39.170><c> as</c><00:11:39.380><c> distracting</c><00:11:40.010><c> as</c><00:11:40.070><c> other</c>

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:40.250 align:start position:0%
that was as distracting as other
 

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
that was as distracting as other
elements<00:11:40.459><c> but</c><00:11:41.060><c> I</c><00:11:41.389><c> think</c><00:11:42.260><c> for</c><00:11:42.410><c> me</c><00:11:42.500><c> yeah</c><00:11:42.829><c> it's</c>
