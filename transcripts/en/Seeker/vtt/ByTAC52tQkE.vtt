00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.000
I’ve got an attitude of gratitude!

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.310
Cuz who wouldn’t working on a cool internet
show like DNews?

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:15.669
Hey everyone, Laci Green here for what will
be my last episode as an official DNews host.

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:17.870
It’s been a great couple of years.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:21.810
This morning I was sitting in our meeting,
thinking about how grateful I am for our audience

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.740
and my team….and how grateful I am for gratitude,
actually.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.240
Gratitude is a super important thing for human
beings - it goes beyond just being polite.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.980
Robert Emmons, a gratitude expert, argues
that gratitude is an affirmation of goodness.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.620
It affirms that there are good things in the
world, and a lot of the time, it’s other

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.470
PEOPLE that fill our lives with goodness.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.630
This manifests in the scientific studies of
gratitude over and over again.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.370
We see a strong link between people who take
time to think about who and what they’re

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.060
grateful for and the experience of emotional
well-being.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.489
Couples who take time to show gratitude to
each other experience higher levels of relationship

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.840
satisfaction and quality the next day.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.640
Grateful people sleep better and they’re
more resilient in times of struggle.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.540
Gratitude also changes the way we treat each
other.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.130
It makes us more willing to forgive and to
treat others with kindness.

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:08.940
In one study in the journal Social Psychological
and Personality Science, participants who

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.710
were primed by thinking about things they’re
grateful for were half as likely to assign

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.610
other participants undesirable tasks.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.610
Why is gratitude so great?

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.403
Well...everyone needs to feel like they’re
valuable and competent, and we all need to

00:01:18.403 --> 00:01:19.403
feel connected to others in some way.

00:01:19.403 --> 00:01:22.090
When you say thank you to someone, those people
report much higher levels of both their perceived

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.110
competence and their value to others.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.110
It’s really powerful!

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.409
The problem for me is, a lot of the time I’ll
FEEL grateful but forget to EXPRESS that gratitude.

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.440
And it’s the expression that has the most
impact.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.369
So, in my departure from DNews, I wanted to
say thank you to all of you who have supported

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:39.140
me and the growth of DNews.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.400
Thank you for your kind tweets, for sharing
our videos, for your follows and likes and

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.659
interesting comments.

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.250
We do notice, and it means a lot to us.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.670
I’m also so so grateful for the intelligent
and talented team here at DNews: Trace, Tara,

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.480
Pam, Chastity, Jared, Barry - thank you all

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.660
For the rest of you out there, I’ll be around
on the interwebs.
