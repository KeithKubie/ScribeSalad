00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.600
So let's talk about how to make truly scalable

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.410
pages. Now, HTML, by default, is supposed to reflow

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.390
text anyway. And text sizes are supposed to be

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.920
consistent. But the worst side effect of this viewport stuff,

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.400
by default, is that, even with nothing set, the

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.260
mobile browser is going to reflow text and render

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.540
as if the window were 980 pixels wide. And

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.000
then scale it to fit it on to the screen.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.360
This may mean that the text looks really small on

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.945
my mobile browser by default. So, the second way to use

00:00:31.945 --> 00:00:33.990
viewport is if your page knows how to adapt to

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.100
width. For example, if it knows how to wrap the contents

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.030
based on the screen width. You can simply the width

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.680
to device width which tells the browser, my website knows how

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.420
to adapt to your width. This is really the best approach.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.140
To build applications that scale their own layout and make intelligent

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.670
decisions about how to do so, rather than just

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.030
trying to scale a fixed layout to fit the screen.
