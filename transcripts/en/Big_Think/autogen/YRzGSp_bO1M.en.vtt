so I think economics has a something to

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:08.260
so I think economics has a something to
 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:09.570
so I think economics has a something to
contribute in terms of our understanding

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:09.580
contribute in terms of our understanding
 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.510
contribute in terms of our understanding
of artificial intelligence because it

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:12.520
of artificial intelligence because it
 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.560
of artificial intelligence because it
gives us a different view so for example

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570
gives us a different view so for example
 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.839
gives us a different view so for example
when when if you ask a technologist to

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:18.849
when when if you ask a technologist to
 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:20.300
when when if you ask a technologist to
tell you about the rise of

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310
tell you about the rise of
 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.800
tell you about the rise of
semiconductors they will talk to you

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:22.810
semiconductors they will talk to you
 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:23.939
semiconductors they will talk to you
about the increasing number of

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:23.949
about the increasing number of
 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:26.370
about the increasing number of
transistors on a chip and how the and

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.380
transistors on a chip and how the and
 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.470
transistors on a chip and how the and
all the science underlying the ability

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480
all the science underlying the ability
 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.819
all the science underlying the ability
to keep increasing

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:29.829
to keep increasing
 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:31.280
to keep increasing
you know doubling number of transistors

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:31.290
you know doubling number of transistors
 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.080
you know doubling number of transistors
every 18 months or so but if you're

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.090
every 18 months or so but if you're
 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.729
every 18 months or so but if you're
asking an economist to describe to you

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:35.739
asking an economist to describe to you
 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:37.860
asking an economist to describe to you
the rise of semiconductors they won't

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870
the rise of semiconductors they won't
 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.500
the rise of semiconductors they won't
talk about transistors on a chip instead

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510
talk about transistors on a chip instead
 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.299
talk about transistors on a chip instead
they'll talk about a drop in the cost of

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:42.309
they'll talk about a drop in the cost of
 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:44.099
they'll talk about a drop in the cost of
arithmetic they'll say what's so

00:00:44.099 --> 00:00:44.109
arithmetic they'll say what's so
 

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:46.439
arithmetic they'll say what's so
powerful about semiconductors is they

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:46.449
powerful about semiconductors is they
 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:48.689
powerful about semiconductors is they
substantially reduced the cost of

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:48.699
substantially reduced the cost of
 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:50.930
substantially reduced the cost of
arithmetic it's the same with AI

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940
arithmetic it's the same with AI
 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.009

everybody is fascinated with all the
 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:55.770
everybody is fascinated with all the
magical things AI can do and economists

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780
magical things AI can do and economists

what they bring to the conversation is
 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.810
what they bring to the conversation is
that they are able to look at a and a

wizardry out of it and reduce AI down to
 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.960
wizardry out of it and reduce AI down to
a single question which is what does

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970
a single question which is what does
 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.760
a single question which is what does
this technology reduce the cost of and

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770
this technology reduce the cost of and
 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.310
this technology reduce the cost of and
in the case of AI the recent economists

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320
in the case of AI the recent economists
 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.660
in the case of AI the recent economists
think it's such a foundational

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670
think it's such a foundational
 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.730
think it's such a foundational
technology and why it's so important it

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740
technology and why it's so important it
 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.630
technology and why it's so important it
stands in a different category from

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640
stands in a different category from
 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.859
stands in a different category from
virtually other every other domain of

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869
virtually other every other domain of
 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.050
virtually other every other domain of
technology that we see today is because

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060
technology that we see today is because

technology that we see today is because
the thing for which it drops the cost is

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070
the thing for which it drops the cost is
 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.580
the thing for which it drops the cost is
such a foundational input we use it for

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590
such a foundational input we use it for
 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.740
such a foundational input we use it for
so many things in the case of AI that's

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750
so many things in the case of AI that's
 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.530
so many things in the case of AI that's
prediction and so why that's useful is

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540
prediction and so why that's useful is
 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.690
prediction and so why that's useful is
that as soon as we think of AI is a drop

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700
that as soon as we think of AI is a drop
 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.940
that as soon as we think of AI is a drop
in the cost of prediction first of all

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950
in the cost of prediction first of all
 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.459
in the cost of prediction first of all
it takes away all the confusion of you

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:41.469
it takes away all the confusion of you
 

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:45.029
it takes away all the confusion of you
know what is this current renaissance in

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:45.039
know what is this current renaissance in
 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:47.520
know what is this current renaissance in
AI actually doing is it Westworld is it

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530
AI actually doing is it Westworld is it
 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.469
AI actually doing is it Westworld is it
c-3po is it how you know what is it and

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479
c-3po is it how you know what is it and
 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.240
c-3po is it how you know what is it and
it really what it is is simply a drop in

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250
it really what it is is simply a drop in
 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.830
it really what it is is simply a drop in
the cost of prediction and we define

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840
the cost of prediction and we define
 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.870
the cost of prediction and we define
prediction as taking information you

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880
prediction as taking information you
 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.060
prediction as taking information you
have to generate information you don't

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070
have to generate information you don't
 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.010
have to generate information you don't
have so it's not just their traditional

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020
have so it's not just their traditional
 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.599
have so it's not just their traditional
form of forecasting like taking last

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:03.609
form of forecasting like taking last
 

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:04.920
form of forecasting like taking last
month's sales and predicting next

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930
month's sales and predicting next
 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.100
month's sales and predicting next
month's sales it's also taking for

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110
month's sales it's also taking for
 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.740
month's sales it's also taking for
example if we have a medical image and

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750
example if we have a medical image and
 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.860
example if we have a medical image and
we're looking at a tumor and we suite so

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870
we're looking at a tumor and we suite so
 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.300
we're looking at a tumor and we suite so
that what the data we have is the

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310
that what the data we have is the
 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.530
that what the data we have is the
and what we don't have is the

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540
and what we don't have is the
 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.479
and what we don't have is the
classification of the tumor as benign or

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489
classification of the tumor as benign or
 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.410
classification of the tumor as benign or
malignant that the AI makes that

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420
malignant that the AI makes that
 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.520
malignant that the AI makes that
classification that's a form of

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530
classification that's a form of
 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.559
classification that's a form of
prediction and so when something becomes

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569
prediction and so when something becomes
 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.470
prediction and so when something becomes
cheap we use you know from economics 101

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480
cheap we use you know from economics 101
 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.600
cheap we use you know from economics 101
most people remember there's a downward

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610
most people remember there's a downward
 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.220
most people remember there's a downward
sloping demand curve and so when

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230
sloping demand curve and so when
 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.839
sloping demand curve and so when
something becomes cheaper that means we

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849
something becomes cheaper that means we
 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:36.690
something becomes cheaper that means we
use more of it and so in the case of

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700
use more of it and so in the case of
 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.400
use more of it and so in the case of
prediction as it becomes cheaper we'll

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410
prediction as it becomes cheaper we'll
 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.650
prediction as it becomes cheaper we'll
use more and more of it and so that'll

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660
use more and more of it and so that'll
 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.540
use more and more of it and so that'll
take two forms one is that we'll use

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550
take two forms one is that we'll use
 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.100
take two forms one is that we'll use
more of it for things we traditionally

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110
more of it for things we traditionally
 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.690
more of it for things we traditionally
use prediction for like demand

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700
use prediction for like demand
 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.020
use prediction for like demand
forecasting and supply chain management

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030
forecasting and supply chain management
 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.220
forecasting and supply chain management
but where I think it's really

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230
but where I think it's really
 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.320
but where I think it's really
interesting is that when it becomes

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330
interesting is that when it becomes
 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.630
interesting is that when it becomes
cheap that we'll start using it for

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640
cheap that we'll start using it for
 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.250
cheap that we'll start using it for
things that weren't traditionally

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260
things that weren't traditionally
 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.500
things that weren't traditionally
prediction problems but we'll start

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510
prediction problems but we'll start
 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.449
prediction problems but we'll start
converting problems into prediction

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459
converting problems into prediction
 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:01.979
converting problems into prediction
problems to take advantage of the new

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989
problems to take advantage of the new
 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.140
problems to take advantage of the new
cheap prediction so one example is

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150
cheap prediction so one example is
 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.360
cheap prediction so one example is
driving driving we've had autonomous

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370
driving driving we've had autonomous
 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.059
driving driving we've had autonomous
cars for a long time but we've our

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069
cars for a long time but we've our
 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:10.650
cars for a long time but we've our
autonomous vehicles but we've always

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660
autonomous vehicles but we've always
 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:11.820
autonomous vehicles but we've always
used them inside a controlled

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830
used them inside a controlled
 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.350
used them inside a controlled
environment like a factory or a

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360
environment like a factory or a
 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.550
environment like a factory or a
warehouse and we did that because we had

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560
warehouse and we did that because we had
 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.920
warehouse and we did that because we had
to control the number of think of it as

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930
to control the number of think of it as
 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.930
to control the number of think of it as
the if-then statement so we have a robot

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940
the if-then statement so we have a robot
 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.460
the if-then statement so we have a robot
the engineer would program the robot to

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470
the engineer would program the robot to
 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:24.720
the engineer would program the robot to
move around the factory or the warehouse

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730

said why don't we solve this problem in
 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:06.509
said why don't we solve this problem in
a different way and instead we'll treat

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519
a different way and instead we'll treat
 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:08.490
a different way and instead we'll treat
it as a single prediction problem and

it as a single prediction problem and
 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.140
it as a single prediction problem and
the prediction is what would a good

know we put humans in a car and we told
them to drive and humans have data

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799
them to drive and humans have data
 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:22.409

and what that AI is trying to do is it
 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.290

doesn't have its own input sensors eyes
 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.879

put radar camera lidar
 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.159
put radar camera lidar
around the car and then the AI has this

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169
around the car and then the AI has this
 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:56.249

it's got data coming in it tries to
 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:00.600
it's got data coming in it tries to
predict what in the next second what

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610
predict what in the next second what
 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.490
predict what in the next second what
will the human driver do and in the

will the human driver do and in the
 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.960
will the human driver do and in the
beginning it's a terrible predictor it

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970
beginning it's a terrible predictor it
 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.969
beginning it's a terrible predictor it
makes a lots of mistakes and from a

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:05.979
makes a lots of mistakes and from a
 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:07.350
makes a lots of mistakes and from a
statistical point of view we can say has

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360
statistical point of view we can say has
 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.150
statistical point of view we can say has
big confidence intervals it's not very

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160
big confidence intervals it's not very
 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.240
big confidence intervals it's not very
confident but it learns as it goes and

confident but it learns as it goes and
 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.650
confident but it learns as it goes and
every time it makes a mistake it thinks

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.660
every time it makes a mistake it thinks
 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:14.999
every time it makes a mistake it thinks
that drivers about to turn left but the

that drivers about to turn left but the
 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:16.890
that drivers about to turn left but the
driver doesn't turn left it updates this

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900
driver doesn't turn left it updates this
 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.300
driver doesn't turn left it updates this

updates this model and and as it goes

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120
updates this model and and as it goes
 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.760
updates this model and and as it goes
the predictions get better and better

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770
the predictions get better and better
 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:25.650
the predictions get better and better

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.660
and better and the confidence intervals
 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.870
and better and the confidence intervals
get smaller and smaller and smaller so

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:27.880
get smaller and smaller and smaller so
 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.040
get smaller and smaller and smaller so
we turn driving into a prediction

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050
we turn driving into a prediction
 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.960
we turn driving into a prediction
problem we've turned translation into a

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:30.970
problem we've turned translation into a
 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.120
problem we've turned translation into a
prediction problem now so that used to

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130
prediction problem now so that used to
 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:34.439
prediction problem now so that used to
be a rules-based problem where we had

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:34.449
be a rules-based problem where we had
 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:36.149
be a rules-based problem where we had
linguists with many rules and many

00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:36.159
linguists with many rules and many
 

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:37.320
linguists with many rules and many
exceptions and that's how we did

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330
exceptions and that's how we did
 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.000
exceptions and that's how we did
translation now we've turned into a

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.010
translation now we've turned into a
 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:41.700
translation now we've turned into a
prediction problem I think probably the

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:41.710
prediction problem I think probably the
 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.430
prediction problem I think probably the
most common surprise that people have is

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440
most common surprise that people have is
 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.950
most common surprise that people have is
we have a lot of HR people to come into

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960
we have a lot of HR people to come into
 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.830
we have a lot of HR people to come into
our lab and they say hey you know we're

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840
our lab and they say hey you know we're
 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.320
our lab and they say hey you know we're
here to learn about AI because we need

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.330
here to learn about AI because we need
 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:53.879
here to learn about AI because we need
to know what kinds of people to hire for

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:53.889
to know what kinds of people to hire for
 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:55.920
to know what kinds of people to hire for
our company and you know for our

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930
our company and you know for our
 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.649
our company and you know for our
manufacturing or our sales or you know

00:05:58.649 --> 00:05:58.659
manufacturing or our sales or you know
 

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:00.120
manufacturing or our sales or you know
this or that division of course it won't

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.130
this or that division of course it won't
 

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.070
this or that division of course it won't
affect my division because I'm in HR and

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080
affect my division because I'm in HR and
 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.320
affect my division because I'm in HR and
you know we're a very people part of the

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:04.330
you know we're a very people part of the
 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.120
you know we're a very people part of the
business and so a is not going to affect

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:06.130
business and so a is not going to affect
 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.909
business and so a is not going to affect
us but of course people are breaking HR

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:08.919
us but of course people are breaking HR
 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:10.620
us but of course people are breaking HR
down to a series of prediction problems

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:10.630
down to a series of prediction problems
 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:12.420
down to a series of prediction problems
so for example the first thing HR people

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:12.430
so for example the first thing HR people
 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.180
so for example the first thing HR people
do is is recruit and recruit you see fed

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:15.190
do is is recruit and recruit you see fed
 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:17.879
do is is recruit and recruit you see fed
essentially they take in a set of input

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:17.889
essentially they take in a set of input
 

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:19.620
essentially they take in a set of input
data like resumes and interview

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:19.630
data like resumes and interview
 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:21.210
data like resumes and interview
transcripts and then they try and

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:21.220
transcripts and then they try and
 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.370
transcripts and then they try and
predict from a set of applicants who

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:23.380
predict from a set of applicants who
 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.320
predict from a set of applicants who
will be the best for this job and once

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:25.330
will be the best for this job and once
 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.029
will be the best for this job and once
they make and once they hire people then

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:27.039
they make and once they hire people then
 

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:29.370
they make and once they hire people then
the next part is promotion promotions

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:29.380
the next part is promotion promotions
 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:30.899
the next part is promotion promotions
