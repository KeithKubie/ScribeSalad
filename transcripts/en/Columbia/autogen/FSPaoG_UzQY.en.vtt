chiller a low-temperature chiller and
we're freezing the tanks and what that

00:18:33.159 --> 00:18:33.169
we're freezing the tanks and what that
 

00:18:33.169 --> 00:18:36.340
we're freezing the tanks and what that
does is allow us to melt that ice to

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:36.350
does is allow us to melt that ice to
 

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:38.320
does is allow us to melt that ice to

keeps on going up we all want more power
 

00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:19.630
keeps on going up we all want more power
and more speed it takes more energy so

00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:19.640
and more speed it takes more energy so
 

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:21.700
and more speed it takes more energy so
the way to pay for all this stuff was

so if you're going to do this you need

00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:02.080
so if you're going to do this you need
 

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:03.750
so if you're going to do this you need
to do daylight dimming and you need to

00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:03.760
to do daylight dimming and you need to
 

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:05.820
to do daylight dimming and you need to
do glass partitions on the interior so

00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:05.830
do glass partitions on the interior so
 

00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:07.620
do glass partitions on the interior so
you're bouncing light very deeply into

00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:07.630
you're bouncing light very deeply into
 

00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:08.820
you're bouncing light very deeply into
the interior you need to do daylight

00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:08.830
the interior you need to do daylight
 

00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:10.110
the interior you need to do daylight
dimming so you're harvesting that

00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:10.120
dimming so you're harvesting that
 

00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:12.720
dimming so you're harvesting that
daylight we waste an enormous amount of

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:12.730
daylight we waste an enormous amount of
 

00:28:12.730 --> 00:28:14.430
daylight we waste an enormous amount of
energy by leaving lights on like this

00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:14.440
energy by leaving lights on like this
 

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:16.500
