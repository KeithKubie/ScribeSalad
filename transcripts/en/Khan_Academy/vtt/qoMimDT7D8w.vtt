00:00:00.219 --> 00:00:01.438
- [Voiceover] So we have
this function, f of x,

00:00:01.438 --> 00:00:04.259
expressed as a rational expression here,

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.243
or defined with a rational expression.

00:00:06.243 --> 00:00:07.602
And we are told at each
of the following values

00:00:07.602 --> 00:00:09.959
of x, select whether f has a zero,

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:14.324
a vertical asymptote, or
a removable discontinuity.

00:00:14.324 --> 00:00:15.997
And before even looking at the choices,

00:00:15.997 --> 00:00:17.620
what I am going to do,
because you're not going

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.200
to always going to have
these choices here.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.362
Sometimes you might just have to identify

00:00:20.362 --> 00:00:22.323
the vertical asymptotes, or the zeros,

00:00:22.323 --> 00:00:24.563
or the removable discontinuities,

00:00:24.563 --> 00:00:26.362
is I am going to factor this out.

00:00:26.362 --> 00:00:27.918
And hopefully, or I'm going
to factor the numerator

00:00:27.918 --> 00:00:29.520
and the denominator to hopefully

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.459
makes things a little bit more clear.

00:00:31.459 --> 00:00:33.200
And we are to think
about what x values make

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.646
the numerator and, or the
denominator equal to zero.

00:00:36.646 --> 00:00:39.212
So the numerator, can I factor that?

00:00:39.212 --> 00:00:39.908
Well, let's see.

00:00:39.908 --> 00:00:42.950
What two numbers, their
product is negative 24,

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.028
and they add to negative two.

00:00:45.028 --> 00:00:49.973
See, that would be negative
six and positive four.

00:00:49.973 --> 00:00:54.630
So we could write x minus
six times x plus four.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:55.743
Did I do that right?

00:00:55.743 --> 00:00:58.654
Negative six times four is negative 24.

00:00:58.654 --> 00:01:01.764
Negative six x plus four
x is negative two x.

00:01:01.764 --> 00:01:03.214
Yeah, that's right.

00:01:03.214 --> 00:01:06.267
Alright, and now in the denominator,

00:01:06.267 --> 00:01:10.225
let's see, six times four
is 24, six plus four is 10.

00:01:10.225 --> 00:01:15.225
So we can say, six, x
plus six times x plus 4.

00:01:16.753 --> 00:01:19.076
So let's look at the numerator first.

00:01:19.076 --> 00:01:24.076
The numerator zero if x is equal to

00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:31.958
positive six, or x is
equal to negative four.

00:01:32.739 --> 00:01:37.739
The denominator is zero if x is equal

00:01:39.598 --> 00:01:44.598
to negative six, or x is
equal to negative four.

00:01:46.401 --> 00:01:47.890
So, let's think about it.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.755
Can we simplify this, what
we have up here a little bit?

00:01:52.755 --> 00:01:55.458
And I, in other words, keep in
mind what I just wrote down.

00:01:55.458 --> 00:01:56.955
Well it might be, just
jumping at it, you get

00:01:56.955 --> 00:01:59.363
an x plus four divided by an x plus four,

00:01:59.363 --> 00:02:01.801
why can't we simplify this
expression a little bit?

00:02:01.801 --> 00:02:04.100
And just write this whole thing, write

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.862
our original expression as being

00:02:06.862 --> 00:02:11.862
x minus six over x plus
six, where x, if we want it

00:02:12.121 --> 00:02:15.491
to be algebraically equivalent
we have to constrain

00:02:15.491 --> 00:02:19.786
the domain, where x cannot
be equal to negative four.

00:02:19.786 --> 00:02:22.584
Well this is interesting
because before, when x equals

00:02:22.584 --> 00:02:25.626
negative four, we had all this
weird zero over zero stuff.

00:02:25.626 --> 00:02:28.087
Well we were able to
remove it, and we were able

00:02:28.087 --> 00:02:30.305
to make it this kind of,
this extra condition.

00:02:30.305 --> 00:02:32.151
And if you were to graph
it, it would show up

00:02:32.151 --> 00:02:35.193
as a little bit of a
removable discontinuity.

00:02:35.193 --> 00:02:36.714
A little bit of a point discontinuity,

00:02:36.714 --> 00:02:37.944
just one point, where the function

00:02:37.944 --> 00:02:41.752
is not actually, is actually not defined.

00:02:41.752 --> 00:02:44.294
So in this situation,
and this is typical where

00:02:44.294 --> 00:02:47.905
there's a thing that you can factor out,

00:02:47.905 --> 00:02:49.449
it was making the numerator
and the denominator

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:51.190
equal zero but you can factor that out,

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.351
so it no longer does it.

00:02:52.351 --> 00:02:54.847
That's going to be
removable discontinuity.

00:02:54.847 --> 00:02:59.792
So x equals negative four is
a removable discontinuity.

00:02:59.792 --> 00:03:01.464
And once you've factored
out all the things

00:03:01.464 --> 00:03:03.507
that would make it a
removable discontinuity,

00:03:03.507 --> 00:03:06.142
then you can think about
what's going to be a zero

00:03:06.142 --> 00:03:08.592
and what's going to be
a vertical asymptote.

00:03:08.592 --> 00:03:10.670
If it makes, once you've
factored out everything

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.085
that's common to the
numerator and the denominator,

00:03:13.085 --> 00:03:15.766
if of what's left, something
makes the numerator

00:03:15.766 --> 00:03:17.647
equal to zero, well,
then it's going to make

00:03:17.647 --> 00:03:20.073
this whole expression equal to zero

00:03:20.073 --> 00:03:23.243
and so you're dealing with
a zero, so x equals six.

00:03:23.243 --> 00:03:25.262
Six would make the
numerator equal to zero.

00:03:25.262 --> 00:03:27.143
Six minus six is zero.

00:03:27.143 --> 00:03:30.405
So there you're dealing with a zero.

00:03:30.405 --> 00:03:32.497
And to make the denominator equal to zero,

00:03:32.497 --> 00:03:34.390
you would get x equals negative six.

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:35.609
That would make the denominator equal zero

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:39.195
so that's a vertical asymptote.

00:03:39.195 --> 00:03:40.391
It's called a vertical asymptote

00:03:40.391 --> 00:03:42.469
because as you approach this value,

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:44.629
as approach negative
six, either from values

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:47.206
smaller than negative six
or larger than negative six,

00:03:47.206 --> 00:03:51.629
the denominator is going to
become either very, very, very,

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:54.845
it's either going to become a
very, very, very, very small

00:03:54.845 --> 00:03:57.213
positive number or a very, very,
very small negative number,

00:03:57.213 --> 00:03:59.953
so we're going to approach
zero either from above or below

00:03:59.953 --> 00:04:02.494
and so when you divide by
that, you're going to get

00:04:02.494 --> 00:04:05.606
very large positive values or
very large negative values.

00:04:05.606 --> 00:04:09.286
And so your graph does stuff like that.

00:04:09.286 --> 00:04:12.547
So you have a vertical asymptote.

00:04:12.547 --> 00:04:14.046
It might either do something like that

00:04:14.046 --> 00:04:18.144
or it might do something like this,

00:04:18.144 --> 00:04:20.210
where this is your vertical asymptote,

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:21.232
and then when you approach from here,

00:04:21.232 --> 00:04:22.950
it goes, it bumps up like that.

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.491
So either way, so that's why
that's a vertical asymptote.

00:04:25.491 --> 00:04:27.652
Let's do another one.

00:04:27.652 --> 00:04:32.586
Alright, so same drill and like before,

00:04:32.586 --> 00:04:34.546
let, we'll always pause the video

00:04:34.546 --> 00:04:36.602
and see if you can work
it out on your own.

00:04:36.602 --> 00:04:38.529
Let me factor it.

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:40.851
So let's see, two numbers,
product is negative 32.

00:04:40.851 --> 00:04:43.881
They're going to have
different signs, eight, four.

00:04:43.881 --> 00:04:45.646
And then we want the
large one to be positive

00:04:45.646 --> 00:04:48.142
since they have to add
up to positive four x.

00:04:48.142 --> 00:04:53.142
So x plus eight times x minus four.

00:04:53.575 --> 00:04:54.956
Yep, I think that's right.

00:04:54.956 --> 00:04:59.391
And then divided by, this
is four times four is 16.

00:04:59.391 --> 00:05:01.993
Four, negative four plus
negative four is negative eight

00:05:01.993 --> 00:05:06.392
so this x minus four times x minus four.

00:05:06.392 --> 00:05:08.505
Now this is really, really interesting

00:05:08.505 --> 00:05:10.084
because you might say,
oh, I have an x minus four

00:05:10.084 --> 00:05:13.044
x minus four, maybe, x equals four

00:05:13.044 --> 00:05:15.389
is a removable discontinuity.

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:17.305
And it would have been unless you had,

00:05:17.305 --> 00:05:18.826
if you didn't have this over here,

00:05:18.826 --> 00:05:21.322
because x equals four, even
after you've factored this.

00:05:21.322 --> 00:05:23.770
You still can't, the
expression, the function,

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.871
is still not going to be
defined when x equals four.

00:05:26.871 --> 00:05:30.202
And so this function is
actually equivalent to

00:05:30.202 --> 00:05:32.710
x plus eight over x minus 4.

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.810
I don't have to put that
extra little constraint

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.307
like I did before.

00:05:37.307 --> 00:05:39.408
I don't have to put, I don't have to put

00:05:39.408 --> 00:05:41.011
this little constraint that describes

00:05:41.011 --> 00:05:43.392
this removable discontinuity
because the constraint

00:05:43.392 --> 00:05:45.830
is still there, after I've factored out,

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.035
after I've cancelled out this x minus four

00:05:48.035 --> 00:05:49.417
with this x minus four.

00:05:49.417 --> 00:05:52.528
And so here, we've, this is
actually an algebraically

00:05:52.528 --> 00:05:56.696
equivalent expression to
this one right over here.

00:05:56.696 --> 00:05:59.412
And so now, we can think about

00:05:59.412 --> 00:06:02.071
what the zeros or the vertical asymptotes

00:06:02.071 --> 00:06:04.706
or the removable
discontinuities are going to be.

00:06:04.706 --> 00:06:06.772
Well, something that
makes the numerator zero

00:06:06.772 --> 00:06:10.371
without doing it to the
denominator is going to be a zero.

00:06:10.371 --> 00:06:12.565
And x equals negative
eight makes the numerator

00:06:12.565 --> 00:06:14.469
equal to zero without
doing anything to, without

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:18.335
making the denominator equal to zero.

00:06:18.335 --> 00:06:20.065
It would make the
denominator to negative 12.

00:06:20.065 --> 00:06:23.071
So you could literally just
evaluate h of negative eight

00:06:23.071 --> 00:06:28.071
is equal to zero over negative
12, which is equal to zero.

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:30.907
So that's why we call it a zero.

00:06:30.907 --> 00:06:32.544
What about x equals four?

00:06:32.544 --> 00:06:34.367
Well, x equals four is going
to make the denominator

00:06:34.367 --> 00:06:36.747
only equal to zero, so that's going

00:06:36.747 --> 00:06:40.006
to give us a vertical asymptote.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.490
And we're all done.
