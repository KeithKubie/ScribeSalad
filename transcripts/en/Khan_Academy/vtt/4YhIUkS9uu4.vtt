Sal: Hi, this is Sal
Khan of the Khan Academy.

00:00:04.443 --> 00:00:06.363
I just wanted to thank everyone out there

00:00:06.363 --> 00:00:08.043
for another great year.

00:00:08.043 --> 00:00:10.675
We're now reaching over 10
million students per month

00:00:10.675 --> 00:00:12.056
and then many of you all have noticed

00:00:12.056 --> 00:00:13.781
amazing partnerships and the content

00:00:13.781 --> 00:00:16.836
that we've been able to work
together to put out there.

00:00:16.836 --> 00:00:19.589
One thing I do like remind
people at this time of year

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:23.250
is that we are a 501(c)(3)
not-for-profit organization.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.864
The only reason why we can exist,

00:00:24.864 --> 00:00:27.027
why we can continue to
put out this content,

00:00:27.027 --> 00:00:30.919
is with the help of
supporters like yourself.

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:32.094
I'll just throw that out there.

00:00:32.094 --> 00:00:33.607
If you're in the position,

00:00:33.607 --> 00:00:37.192
whether it's $5, $10,
or a lot more than that,

00:00:37.192 --> 00:00:40.400
every penny is very much appreciated by us

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.273
at Khan Academy so that
we can continue to try

00:00:43.273 --> 00:00:46.633
to deliver a free world-class
education to the world.
