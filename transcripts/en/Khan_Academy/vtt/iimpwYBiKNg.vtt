00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:05.190
The perimeter of Tina's
rectangular garden is 60 feet.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.980
If the length of the
garden is twice the width,

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.580
what are the dimensions
of the garden?

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.190
So let's draw this garden
here, Tina's garden.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:16.750
So it's a rectangle.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.010
They tell us that it's
a rectangular garden.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.500
So it looks something like this.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.230
And let's say that
this is the width.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:24.646
So if this is the
width, then this

00:00:24.646 --> 00:00:26.110
is also going to be the width.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:27.900
And this is the length up here.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.070
And they tell us that
the length of the garden

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:31.570
is twice the width.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.310
So if this is w, then the
length is going to be 2w.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:36.910
It's going to be
twice the width.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.870
This is also going
to be 2w over here.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.910
Now, what's the
perimeter of this garden?

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.502
Well, it's going to be w
plus w plus 2w plus 2w.

00:00:46.502 --> 00:00:47.460
Let me write this down.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.001
The perimeter of
this garden is going

00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:57.370
to be equal to w plus
2w plus w plus 2w, which

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:58.460
is equal to what?

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.300
This is w plus 2w is 3w, 4w, 6w.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.560
So this is equal to 6w.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.770
That's the perimeter
in terms of the width.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.090
But they also tell us that
the actual numerical value

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.000
of the perimeter is 60 feet.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.870
It is 60 feet.

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:21.070
So this perimeter 6w
must be equal to 60

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.310
if we assume that we're
dealing with feet.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.320
So we just have the
equation 6w is equal to 60.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.330
We can divide both
sides of this equation

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.410
by 6 so that we have just
a w on the left-hand side.

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.380
6w divided by 6 is just w.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.780
And then 60 divided by 6 is 10.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.820
So we have w is equal to 10.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.580
So the width of
the garden is 10.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.160
So this distance
over here is 10.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.210
And then what is the
length of the garden?

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.010
Well, it's 2 times the width.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.000
So this is equal to 20.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.570
The length is equal to 20.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:57.320
And so we're done.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.567
This is a 20 by 10 garden.
