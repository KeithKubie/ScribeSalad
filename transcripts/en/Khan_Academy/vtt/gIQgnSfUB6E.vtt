00:00:00.834 --> 00:00:04.300
- [Voiceover] Right over
here we have the graph of F

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.167
and then we have four
different expressions.

00:00:08.167 --> 00:00:10.489
What I encourage you to
do is pause this video

00:00:10.489 --> 00:00:12.028
and see if you can
figure out which of these

00:00:12.028 --> 00:00:14.634
expressions would give
the largest quantity,

00:00:14.634 --> 00:00:16.567
the second largest quantity, the second

00:00:16.567 --> 00:00:20.811
smallest quantity and
the smallest quantity.

00:00:20.811 --> 00:00:22.767
I'm assuming you have paused the video

00:00:22.767 --> 00:00:24.079
and you have given an attempt.

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:26.300
Now let's work through this together.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.367
This first expression right over here,

00:00:28.367 --> 00:00:31.100
we're taking the sum from
I equals zero to nine.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.967
We're actually taking
the sum of 10 things,

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:35.586
because we're taking
the zero thing, first,

00:00:35.586 --> 00:00:37.433
second, third, all the way up to nine.

00:00:37.433 --> 00:00:38.966
So this is actually going
to be the sum of 10 things

00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:41.233
because we're starting at zero.

00:00:41.233 --> 00:00:46.233
We start at F of negative five plus zero.

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:51.228
We're saying negative five,

00:00:51.228 --> 00:00:53.897
F of negative five plus zero.

00:00:53.897 --> 00:00:56.967
That's this height right over here.

00:00:56.967 --> 00:00:59.935
That's that height right over there.

00:00:59.935 --> 00:01:02.567
We're going to take that,
and then when I equals one

00:01:02.567 --> 00:01:04.389
it's going to be negative five plus one,

00:01:04.389 --> 00:01:05.995
which is negative four.

00:01:05.995 --> 00:01:08.033
It's that height right over there.

00:01:08.033 --> 00:01:11.966
Then negative five plus
two when I equals two.

00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:15.100
It's going to be that
height right over there.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.859
We're essentially going
to sum up all the way.

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:20.293
This is going to be negative five,

00:01:20.293 --> 00:01:24.700
negative five all the way up to, negative

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.634
five plus nine is going to
get us all the way to four.

00:01:28.634 --> 00:01:31.526
It's going to be all the way over there.

00:01:31.526 --> 00:01:33.602
All the way over there.

00:01:33.602 --> 00:01:35.700
You might be guessing,
"Well, how do I relate this?

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.500
"They've already kind of made us think

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.300
"that we're going to somehow relate this

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.634
"to area somehow, but how do we

00:01:41.634 --> 00:01:44.166
"actually make that relationship?"

00:01:44.166 --> 00:01:47.500
Because right now, as this is written,

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.535
it's just giving us essentially a bunch

00:01:49.535 --> 00:01:52.319
of the values of the
functions at different points.

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:53.100
I guess you could say it's a lot

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.700
of these heights, right over here.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.073
But one thing that might jump out at you

00:01:59.073 --> 00:02:02.166
is you could construct
rectangles, all that have

00:02:02.166 --> 00:02:05.034
width one, and so if
you multiply the height

00:02:05.034 --> 00:02:06.633
times the width, the area is going to be

00:02:06.633 --> 00:02:07.766
the same thing as the height.

00:02:07.766 --> 00:02:10.634
If we put a one times one right over here,

00:02:10.634 --> 00:02:11.708
this makes it very
clear that you're taking

00:02:11.708 --> 00:02:16.433
the height times the
width of this rectangle

00:02:16.433 --> 00:02:17.833
and then this rectangle.

00:02:17.833 --> 00:02:21.760
You essentially have
a bunch of left-handed

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.719
rectangles that you could imagine are

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:29.719
trying to estimate this bluish
area that was shaded in.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.900
It's clearly going to be an underestimate,

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.817
because it's giving up these areas.

00:02:36.817 --> 00:02:38.812
It's giving up those
areas, right over there.

00:02:38.812 --> 00:02:40.966
All of these rectangles are sitting,

00:02:40.966 --> 00:02:42.168
they're either just touching or they are

00:02:42.168 --> 00:02:44.033
below the actual function.

00:02:44.033 --> 00:02:45.368
Let me just write this right over here.

00:02:45.368 --> 00:02:49.704
This is going to be an underestimate

00:02:49.704 --> 00:02:53.433
of the area of this blue area.

00:02:53.433 --> 00:02:55.659
Now let's think about
what this one is, here.

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:59.033
This is F, it's the same thing
that we're taking the sum of.

00:02:59.033 --> 00:03:03.033
We're starting at I equals
one and we're going to 10.

00:03:03.033 --> 00:03:05.300
Once again, 10 things.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.500
Negative five plus one is negative four.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.100
F of that is this line, right over here.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.233
Is that line right over there.

00:03:14.233 --> 00:03:17.566
It looks like we're taking
right-handed rectangles,

00:03:17.566 --> 00:03:19.833
because you could say times one,

00:03:19.833 --> 00:03:22.300
times one would be the area.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.834
Obviously, if we multiply
by one, we're not

00:03:23.834 --> 00:03:26.946
changing the value of this expression.

00:03:26.946 --> 00:03:30.500
That would be the area of this
first right-handed rectangle.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.433
Then when I is equal to
two, it's going to be

00:03:33.433 --> 00:03:35.833
F of negative three, and so you're

00:03:35.833 --> 00:03:38.843
looking at this one right over here.

00:03:38.843 --> 00:03:43.833
I can, let me draw at
least this part of it.

00:03:43.833 --> 00:03:46.500
It's going to look something like this.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.765
It's going to look something like this,

00:03:47.765 --> 00:03:49.633
where now we're dealing with right-handed

00:03:49.633 --> 00:03:52.484
rectangles, and these are
clearly an overestimate.

00:03:52.484 --> 00:03:55.084
These are right-handed rectangles.

00:03:55.084 --> 00:03:57.700
You're going to go all the
way, when I is equal to 10,

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.504
negative five plus 10 is five F of five.

00:04:00.504 --> 00:04:02.967
That's this line right over here,

00:04:02.967 --> 00:04:05.900
or this length right over here, F of five.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.700
Of course, we're multiplying it by one.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.233
It's going to look like that,
and we could keep going.

00:04:12.233 --> 00:04:14.146
I think you get the general idea now.

00:04:14.146 --> 00:04:16.367
These are all going to be right-handed

00:04:16.367 --> 00:04:19.433
or these are all right handed
rectangles that I've drawn.

00:04:19.433 --> 00:04:21.035
These are going to be an
overestimate of the area,

00:04:21.035 --> 00:04:23.233
because they all have this little extra,

00:04:23.233 --> 00:04:26.033
they all have this extra
region, right over here.

00:04:26.033 --> 00:04:31.033
These are going to be an overestimate.

00:04:31.168 --> 00:04:33.566
Now let's think about
this one, right over here.

00:04:33.566 --> 00:04:36.700
This is, we're going to
start at I equals one

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.967
and we're going to go to 20.

00:04:38.967 --> 00:04:40.766
It looks like we're going to do rectangles

00:04:40.766 --> 00:04:45.166
instead of width one, we're
going to width one half.

00:04:45.166 --> 00:04:48.100
Once again, since we're
starting at I equals one,

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.366
these look like right-handed
rectangles again.

00:04:51.366 --> 00:04:53.367
This is, that we're
going to use to estimate.

00:04:53.367 --> 00:04:55.566
Let me do this in a color
that you can actually see.

00:04:55.566 --> 00:04:57.233
I'll do this in orange.

00:04:57.233 --> 00:04:59.166
I'll do this in orange right over here.

00:04:59.166 --> 00:05:03.211
The first one is going to be
negative five plus one half.

00:05:03.211 --> 00:05:05.433
It's going to be this, F
of that, which is going

00:05:05.433 --> 00:05:08.073
to take you right over there.

00:05:08.073 --> 00:05:08.874
Then you're going to multiply

00:05:08.874 --> 00:05:12.100
it times the width, which is one half.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.500
Now we have twice as many, twice as many

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.300
right-handed rectangles.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.700
It's going to look like this.

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:22.930
Twice as, and I won't do all of them

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:24.546
because it takes some time.

00:05:24.546 --> 00:05:26.300
We're going to have twice as many

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.453
right-handed rectangles.

00:05:29.453 --> 00:05:33.869
It's still going to be an overestimate,

00:05:33.869 --> 00:05:35.468
but it's going to be
less of an overestimate

00:05:35.468 --> 00:05:37.161
than this one over here.

00:05:37.161 --> 00:05:38.633
Because this one over here, you had all

00:05:38.633 --> 00:05:41.100
of this extra green
space above the function.

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.033
Now we have a lot less extra space,

00:05:44.033 --> 00:05:47.900
a lot less extra space above the function.

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.367
It's a better estimate, but it's still

00:05:49.367 --> 00:05:51.233
going to be an overestimate,
because at least

00:05:51.233 --> 00:05:53.167
for this function right over here,

00:05:53.167 --> 00:05:56.301
because at least over this interval

00:05:56.301 --> 00:05:58.033
where the function is increasing,

00:05:58.033 --> 00:06:01.700
the right-handed rectangle
is giving us an overestimate.

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:02.945
But this is a little bit more precise

00:06:02.945 --> 00:06:07.945
because we're using narrower
rectangles to estimate.

00:06:09.033 --> 00:06:13.233
Overestimate but less so, but less so

00:06:13.233 --> 00:06:15.500
than this one right over here.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.166
This right over here, this
is a definite interval,

00:06:17.166 --> 00:06:19.902
from negative five to five of F of X, DX.

00:06:19.902 --> 00:06:22.034
You can imagine, this
is essentially the limit

00:06:22.034 --> 00:06:23.766
as we take these widths to be smaller

00:06:23.766 --> 00:06:24.900
and smaller and smaller.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.100
We essentially end up having
essentially an infinite number.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.688
We approach an infinite number

00:06:29.688 --> 00:06:31.434
of these right over here.

00:06:31.434 --> 00:06:33.300
This is the actual area.

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.834
This is what's actually depicted in blue.

00:06:35.834 --> 00:06:39.167
This is the actual area.

00:06:39.167 --> 00:06:42.100
If I were to list this
from largest to smallest.

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.367
The biggest overestimate, this is

00:06:44.367 --> 00:06:47.766
the biggest overestimate,
right over there.

00:06:47.766 --> 00:06:49.367
This is still going to be an overestimate

00:06:49.367 --> 00:06:50.700
but it's a little bit more precise

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.900
because we have more rectangles.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:54.700
I'll put that two.

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:56.366
This is the actual area.

00:06:56.366 --> 00:06:57.900
I'll put that three.

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:59.766
Then this is actually an underestimate.

00:06:59.766 --> 00:07:01.500
I would rank this four.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.766
This is the largest of the values,

00:07:03.766 --> 00:07:08.438
and this is going to be
the smallest of the values.
