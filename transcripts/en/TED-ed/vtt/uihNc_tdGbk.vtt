00:00:14.157 --> 00:00:17.007
It is the spring of 1787.

00:00:17.007 --> 00:00:20.789
The Revolutionary War has been over for only six years,

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.089
and the young United States is still struggling in its infancy.

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:31.873
Uprisings, boundary disputes and the lack of a common vision all plague the newborn country.

00:00:31.873 --> 00:00:34.789
In an effort to steady this precarious ship,

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:40.258
the Confederation Congress calls on states to send delegates to the grand Convention,

00:00:40.258 --> 00:00:43.273
to begin on May 14 in Philadelphia.

00:00:43.273 --> 00:00:47.956
The delegates must draft revisions to the Articles of Confederation,

00:00:47.956 --> 00:00:52.089
which would then be considered by the Congress and approved by the states.

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:53.889
Under the terms of the Articles,

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:57.839
all 13 states had to agree to any changes.

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:02.191
Since the purpose of the Convention is just to make recommendations,

00:01:02.191 --> 00:01:04.472
not everyone is excited about attending,

00:01:04.472 --> 00:01:08.190
and frankly, some think it's a waste of time.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:14.557
As men from different parts of the country began to travel down dusty, rugged roads on the way to Philadelphia,

00:01:14.557 --> 00:01:16.623
not all states send delegates.

00:01:16.623 --> 00:01:20.339
In fact, Rhode Island never even shows up.

00:01:20.339 --> 00:01:23.705
On May 14th, only 8 delegates --

00:01:23.705 --> 00:01:26.156
not states, but individual delegates --

00:01:26.156 --> 00:01:28.790
are present, so they wait.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:34.405
Finally, on May 25th, the necessary quorum of seven states is acheived.

00:01:34.405 --> 00:01:39.907
In all, 55 delegates arrive in Philadelphia over the course of the Convention.

00:01:39.907 --> 00:01:46.173
They are all white males, property owners, and the average age is about 44.

00:01:46.173 --> 00:01:50.256
Some are slaveholders, some had signed the Declaration of Independence, [James Madison, Roger Sherman]

00:01:50.256 --> 00:01:53.639
and almost all are well-educated. [Benjamin Franklin]

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:57.239
Picture the delegates, James Madison and George Washington among them,

00:01:57.239 --> 00:02:02.206
sitting in Independence Hall in hot, humid Philadelphia.

00:02:02.206 --> 00:02:07.858
They're all wearing the dress of the day: frock coats, high collars and thick pants.

00:02:07.858 --> 00:02:13.323
They vote to keep their discussions secret to encourage honest debate.

00:02:13.323 --> 00:02:20.607
But that means the windows are closed, and there is no air conditioning in 1787, not even an electric fan.

00:02:20.607 --> 00:02:27.107
and they'll sit in that sweltering heat, in those heavy clothes, for three months.

00:02:27.107 --> 00:02:30.690
Shockingly, they all keep their vow of secrecy.

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.789
That could never happen today, not even for an hour-long meeting.

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:40.223
Someone would share "James Madison thinks he's so smart.

00:02:40.223 --> 00:02:43.540
Keyword: articles are dead" via social media,

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.006
and the whole thing would be a disaster.

00:02:46.006 --> 00:02:52.556
But in 1787, there are no leaks. Not even a drip that hints at what they are doing.

00:02:52.556 --> 00:02:58.706
And what they are doing is nothing short of overthrowing the very government that sent them there.

00:02:58.706 --> 00:03:04.673
Within a few days, with only a seven-state quorum, and only six of those states agreeing,

00:03:04.673 --> 00:03:08.422
a handful of men change the course of history.

00:03:08.422 --> 00:03:12.057
They vote to get rid of the Articles of Confederation,

00:03:12.057 --> 00:03:17.039
and write a new, more nationalistic document that becomes our Constitution.

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:19.006
The risk is immense.

00:03:19.006 --> 00:03:23.124
Everyone on the outside assumes they were working on recommended revisions to the Articles.

00:03:23.124 --> 00:03:29.274
It's an incredible gamble, and even when the Convention presents the signed Constitution on September 17th,

00:03:29.274 --> 00:03:31.556
not all delegates endorse it.

00:03:31.556 --> 00:03:33.756
The country will argue and debate for two more years

00:03:33.756 --> 00:03:37.873
before the document is adopted by the required nine out of 13 states.

00:03:37.873 --> 00:03:40.289
But instead of punishing them for their deception,

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:46.206
today we celebrate the wisdom and vision of those men in Philadelphia.
