Hello internet, guess what?

00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:04.400
I've started a podcast, and it's called Hello Internet.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.160
It's with me, and Brady (he, of the very many YouTube channels)

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.180
And we're talking about life, and work, and YouTube, and whatever happens to catch our attention.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.160
So if you want to check it out, (which I really hope you do,)

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.260
you can click this gigantic button right here, or the link in the description below to head on over to the website

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:21.240
and have a listen.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.040
So go ahead and do that right now, because I can't wait to see what you think.
