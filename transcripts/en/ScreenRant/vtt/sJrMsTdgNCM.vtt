00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.710
Ever superhero needs a supervillain, but when
it comes to the comic book industry, one rivalry

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:15.660
rises above all others: Marvel vs DC Comics.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.560
Long before the companies dreamed of shared
movie universes, fans debated which heroes

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.631
would come out on top: Marvel’s Avengers,
or DC’s Justice League.

00:00:22.631 --> 00:00:26.660
The fans aren’t always going to agree, and
the heroes definitely won’t be doing battle

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:27.660
any time soon.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.900
So for now, we can only look to the comics
and imagine how a battle between Marvel and

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.640
DC’s best and brightest would play out.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.949
Mare sure you let us know hwat you think in
the comments below!

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:44.050
Here is our answer to the question – The
Avengers vs. Justice League: Who Would Win?

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.530
Captain America vs. Batman

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.830
It’s only fair to give each superhero a
single opponent, and it’s hard to think

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.210
of two men less alike than Steve Rogers and
Bruce Wayne.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.440
Embodying the brightest and darkest of humanity,
these two would let their martial arts training

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.800
do the talking.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.309
Cap would have an edge thanks to his superhuman
strength, but Batman has never needed a superpower

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.649
beyond his gadgets, intellect, and gift for
planning ahead.

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:11.960
Both men would land some punches, but considering
Batman is the only person trusted to bring

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.500
down Superman, and is willing to cross lines
no good soldier ever would, there’s no way

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.760
Cap comes out ahead.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.820
Wonder Woman vs. Thor

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.090
It wouldn’t be a battle between good and
evil, but a fight between god and goddess

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.530
would be one for the ages.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.200
Both are divine juggernauts in their own universe,
but most of the Asgardians and Amazons superpowers

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.340
would be cancelled out, since both are almost
completely invincible.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.720
But even if Diana’s powers come from the
ancient Greek gods, Thor’s are completely

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.840
alien and cosmic in origin.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.840
Add in his ability to fly into Warrior’s
Madness, granting him nearly limitless strength

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.360
and rage, and even Diana’s divine magic
would be tested.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.240
She may have been noble enough to wield Thor’s
hammer in the comics, but in a head-to-head

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.070
fight, there’s just no matching the god
of thunder.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.130
Iron Man vs. Cyborg

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:06.329
It’s hard to know which would be the more
important angle of this battle: robotic suits,

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.390
or IQs.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.170
Tony Stark and Vic Stone were both brilliant
men before tragedy struck, merging their bodies

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.849
with cutting-edge technology (in Cyborg’s
case, literally replacing his lost limbs and

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:18.380
organs with advanced tech).

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.900
There’s no question Cyborg would land some
punishing hits, particularly with his sonic

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.840
cannon, but he became a DC icon based on his
personality – not lethality.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.820
The fight would prove that Cyborg deserves
just as much fame as Iron Man, but in the

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.730
end, Tony’s knack for invention and global
protection would give him the upper hand,

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.060
even if he needed to create a brand new weapon
or government agency to do it.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.060
Superman vs. Hulk

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.850
It may not be the marquee match-up comic fans
would hope for, but if it’s Superman’s

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.750
job to take on the biggest physical threat,
then Hulk is his man.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.840
The two have both been given almost endless
power over the years, with Hulk able to survive

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.780
nuclear bombs, and apparently not given any
limit to how strong his anger can make him.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.880
Unfortunately for him, Superman is Superman.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.040
Without Kryptonite or magic, there’s almost
no blow Superman couldn’t survive.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.540
Plus, you don’t need to destroy Hulk to
beat him, since a quick trip to the Moon would

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:12.599
take him out of the fight.

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:16.250
And if there’s one League member who you
just can’t stay mad at, it has to be the

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.959
mild mannered Kansas farm boy.

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.489
Green Lantern vs. Captain Marvel

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:27.550
As a pair of fighter pilots who cross paths
with alien warriors and wind up superheroes

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.690
patrolling deep space, Hal Joran and Carol
Danvers would have plenty to talk about.

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.260
Ms. Marvel’s gifts are a result of fusing
with the alien DNA of the original Captain

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.290
Marvel, meaning she can fly, survive in space,
and even fire powerful energy blasts from

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:42.470
her hands.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.659
But the Green Lantern ring is something of
a “win” button in this fight, since Hal

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:50.580
could create almost anything he could imagine
– including replicating Carol’s own powers.

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.239
Even without the Corps at his back, Hal has
found a way to win almost every fight the

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:55.910
DC universe could throw at him.

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.439
With his ring in hand, Ms. Marvel would learn
the hard way that the Lantern’s oath is

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:04.280
also a warning to any would-be challengers.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.341
Aquaman vs Namor The Submariner

00:04:09.341 --> 00:04:15.480
For the sake of Marvel AND DC fans, it’s
best not to point out all the similarities

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.090
between their half human/half-Atlantean warriors.

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.553
They’re basically identical, with both heroes
able to live underwater, and being able to

00:04:22.553 --> 00:04:26.620
communicate and work with marine life – when
they’re not too busy leading their kingdoms.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.550
Namor’s strange or unexplained powers would
be the biggest difference, since he can fly

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.870
thanks to wings growing out of his ankles,
and control water itself.

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.729
Fans might hope that the two sons of the ocean
and mainland could find common ground, but

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:41.160
given both of their tempers, a fight is inevitable.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:48.200
And even if it’s due to his extra mutant
powers, the Sub-Mariner has the advantage.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.550
Spider-Man vs. The Flash

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.900
How do you stop a hero able to move at the
speed of light?

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.831
Easy, put him up against a man who can sense
the future.

00:04:56.831 --> 00:05:01.940
Peter Parker’s spidey sense would help him
evade some of The Flash’s attacks, and he’s

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.120
got the brains to keep a trick or two up his
sleeve… but DC has made it clear that Barry

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.870
Allen and Wally West are almost impossible
to stop once their full power is unlocked.

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.160
The Flash would win this round, but honestly,
the two jokesters are just as likely to become

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.260
best friends before a punch is even thrown.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.800
If we tally everything up, it seems Justice
League would take it home… but that’s

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.840
just one way we see a showdown between Marvel
and DC’s greatest heroes shaking out, but

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:26.970
what do you think?

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.130
Were our predictions in line with your own,
or do you think we’re selling some of the

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:31.300
heroes short?
