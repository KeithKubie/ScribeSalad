00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.370
So in light of this 50-year anniversary
of the assassination of Dr. King what

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.139
comes to mind to me is that Dr. King
fought for civil rights and I think in

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.880
so many ways education is the civil
rights issue of the 21st century and so

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.230
when I think about education and what it
means it means opportunity, it means hope,

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.740
it means possibilities. So in light of
this question of whether or not we're

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.490
talking about chaos or community we have
to choose community because in so many

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.470
ways the issues in the topics that Dr.
King fought for a half a century ago are

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.350
still relevant if not worse today. Dr.
King fought for greater income equality.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.760
Today we have unprecedented levels of
income inequality so we have to see

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.469
education as a potential solution to
ameliorating those differences. Dr. King

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.610
fought for the end of segregated schools
in our country. Today many of our schools

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.570
are even more racially segregated than
they were 50 years ago so we have to

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.530
choose community over chaos. So much
of what I see is being pertinent to why

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.570
UCLA is important because UCLA trains
future educators, UCLA trains future

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.010
psychologists, future social
workers. These are the individuals who we

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.760
have to work collectively with to help
create more of an opportunity for those

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.210
communities that have been on the
fringes looking in. Immigrant children,

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.330
children of color, women, homeless youth,
foster youth. So in so many ways UCLA has

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.650
to be a beacon of that hope of that
possibility that King talked about when

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.000
he said community or chaos. Chaos is
never good for us. I believe that

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.810
education has to be the foundation.
Education has to be the platform by

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.200
which we begin to increase awareness and
when we increase awareness hopefully we

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.939
increase empathy people begin to care
people begin to act and we then become

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.420
change agents for our own communities
and our own society.
