00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.850
French novelist
Andre Malraux said

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:04.302
that man is not what
he thinks he is.

00:00:04.302 --> 00:00:05.991
He is what he hides.

00:00:05.991 --> 00:00:06.740
And you know what?

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.031
I think he was on to something.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:14.360
Hey, everyone.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.485
Laci Green here for D News.

00:00:15.485 --> 00:00:18.160
When we're little kids, we first
learn about secrets by, say,

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.930
keeping a birthday
present a surprise.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:20.705
And it's so fun.

00:00:20.705 --> 00:00:23.680
But as we age, and our lives
become more complicated,

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.310
so do our secrets.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.230
Then secrets become not as fun.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.610
But, hey, that's part of
the grand disappointment

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:30.690
that is adulthood.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.330
Maybe you secretly hate someone.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.650
Maybe you're secretly
a disgusting human

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.580
who does gross stuff
when you're alone.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:37.150
Don't lie.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.050
I know you all have
some nasty habits.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.820
Or maybe you have
sexual secrets,

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.300
common ones being masturbating,
cheating on a partner,

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.620
or hiding your
sexual orientation.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.480
Psychologists believe that the
ability to keep small secrets

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.010
is a sign of good mental health.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.270
There's a time and a place
for sharing some things,

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.780
you know what I mean?

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.425
I'm talking about
those TMI secrets.

00:00:55.425 --> 00:00:57.560
Have a secret or two
about ourselves has also

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.580
been shown to help us
develop a sense of self

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.570
outside of the crowd,
which is a positive thing

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:02.540
for our identities.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.849
But what about big secrets?

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:06.040
Damaging secrets?

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.320
Secrets that eat you
from the inside out,

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.490
secrets that you hold
onto, maybe for years.

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.187
Scientists have found that these
kind of secrets are bad news.

00:01:15.187 --> 00:01:17.270
A study in the International
Journal of Behavioral

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.910
Development found
that young adults who

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.368
admitted they were
keeping a secret

00:01:20.368 --> 00:01:22.430
had lower levels of
self control, higher

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.270
levels of loneliness
and depression,

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.410
and their personal
relationships were compromised.

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.720
The researchers checked back
in with them six months later,

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.386
and those who had
revealed their secrets

00:01:30.386 --> 00:01:32.440
showed a dramatic
improvements in symptoms.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.550
At the end of the
study, they found

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.930
that the women were more
likely than men to have secrets

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.250
and that they were also
less likely to share them.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.080
Another super interesting
study published

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.460
in the Journal of Social
Psychology and Personality

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.310
Science found that
secrets actually

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.450
feel physically burdensome.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.550
You know how people talk about
having baggage or feeling

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:50.145
heavy?

00:01:50.145 --> 00:01:51.520
People in the
study who were told

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.160
to focus on a
personal secret judged

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.560
hills to be steeper and
distances to be longer

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.140
than they actually
were, while people

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.410
who were given the opportunity
to tell their secret

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:00.590
felt no such burden.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.060
So in case you needed more
proof that keeping a secret

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.560
feels like crap,
and telling someone

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.720
can be the greatest relief
ever, now you have it.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.370
The good news-- or
maybe the bad news,

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:09.280
depending on how
you look at it--

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.460
is that, one way or
another, our brains usually

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.320
find a way to purge itself
of distressing secrets.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.950
Harvard neuroscientist
Laura Smart

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.920
explains that when we
try to suppress a secret,

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.430
a mental process called ironic
monitoring unconsciously kicks

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.010
in.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.937
Its surveys unwanted
thoughts, eventually

00:02:23.937 --> 00:02:26.270
bringing them bubbling to the
surface, where they become

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.120
a part of the intentional
operating process, which

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.690
is our conscious awareness.

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.780
In other words,
secrets haunt you

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.970
until they're allowed
to break free.

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.484
So, peeps, I really
care about you,

00:02:36.484 --> 00:02:38.650
and I don't want you to
have any nervous breakdowns,

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.695
so today's comment board
will be a confessional.

00:02:40.695 --> 00:02:43.410
Spill your secrets down
below, and walk away

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.516
a healthier person.

00:02:44.516 --> 00:02:45.890
Thanks for joining
me for D News.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.190
I'll see you next time.
