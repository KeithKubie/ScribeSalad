JASON CRANE: Good
afternoon, everybody,

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.270
and welcome to Zagat
Guest Chefs at Google.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.630
My name is Jason Crane, and
I'm a chef here on campus,

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.660
and it is my proud pleasure to
welcome Marcy Masumoto today

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.710
from Masumoto Family Farms
in Del Rey, California.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.800
They are a local family-owned
peach grower and farmer,

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.610
and they also do
nectarines, and raisins,

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.320
and some other
interesting things too.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.240
And we'll get to
talking about that,

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.270
but I'd like to start off
by just letting Marcy talk

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.017
a little bit about what goes
on out there in her own words

00:00:34.017 --> 00:00:35.850
and maybe do a little
reading from the book.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.120
And then we'll get to the Q&amp;A.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:37.630
MARCY MASUMOTO: Absolutely.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:38.130
Thank you.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.090
It's my pleasure to be here.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.070
What a delight to
be on this campus

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.360
and enjoying the world
through the view of Google.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.500
I love it anyhow.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.190
My pleasure.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.860
So my name is Marcy Masumoto.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.290
I am part of the
Masumoto Family Farm.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:02.830
My husband's grandfather-- all
his grandparents immigrated

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:08.580
from Japan turn of the century,
a hundred and something years

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.400
ago, and settled in the
Central Valley near Fresno.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.840
World War II came around.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.960
Japanese-Americans were
relocated to relocation camps,

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.280
and my husband's father chose
to return to the Central Valley

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.160
to farm.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.640
And it wasn't until 1948
then, after World War II,

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.520
that the family actually
had enough money

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.590
to purchase the land themselves.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.380
And we actually
live on that farm

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.570
that the family bought
so many years ago.

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.140
Since then, about
20 years later,

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.500
they purchased an
adjacent 40 acres.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.710
So at this point
the Masumoto family

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.580
owns-- we are a
small farm, and we

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.300
have an 80-acre farm,
family-run and operated.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.550
We live on this farm.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.460
My kids grew up on the farm.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.050
So my daughter's taking
over the farm now.

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.590
She's 28 years old and
had made the decision

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.577
while she was in
college that she

00:02:11.577 --> 00:02:12.910
wanted to come back to the farm.

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.180
She realized that this was her
life, this was her passion,

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.260
and you could see a
picture of Nikiko there.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.720
But she's taking over
the farm, and so she

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.920
will be the fourth
generation working the land.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.310
We grow grapes and
peaches, about 25 acres

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:32.390
of the tree fruit.

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:33.860
We have seven
different varieties

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.490
of peaches, three
varieties of nectarines.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.350
And then the balance of our land
is two things at this point.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.090
We grow Thompson seedless
grapes for raisins,

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.310
and then we also have some land
that we're giving a rest right

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.920
now, especially with the
drought and the lack of water.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:59.430
We've for a couple years now, we
are fallowing some of the land

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.030
and returning it to some natural
landscape, which is certainly

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.650
beneficial for an organic farm.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.520
So that's a little bit about
the history of our farm.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.790
The book that we're
celebrating today

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.530
was a joint effort
between the three

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.210
of us, my daughter, my
husband, and myself.

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:18.710
It came out just last June.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.030
It's called "The Perfect
Peach-- Recipes and Stories

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.520
from the Masumoto Family Farm."

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.710
Probably a little
bit that I should add

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.710
is that books are not
new to our family.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.110
This was the first book that
my daughter and I were involved

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.500
with writing, but my
husband's also a writer,

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.920
so he's published
a number of books.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.150
Maybe some of you have
heard of some of them.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.850
But his first book that was
published here in the US

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.180
was "Epitaph for
a Peach," and that

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.120
was a literary piece about
saving the family farm.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.860
And that book, years
ago, was honored

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.360
as a Julia Child Cookbook Award
winner in the literary food

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.230
category.

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:03.610
No recipes in that book.

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.180
My husband does not cook.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.550
My daughter and I are
the cooks, and so we

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.870
did the other part of this
book, so it's a combination.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.780
So that's kind of a
little bit about us.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.950
Let me just share just a
tiny bit about this book

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:26.120
and what it is that we're
here to talk today about.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.380
The book we called, "The
Perfect Peach," because I think,

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.490
for those of you that
enjoy fruit, you're

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.962
always in search of that
elusive, perfect fruit.

00:04:37.962 --> 00:04:40.420
Whether they're in season, out
season, you're at the store,

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:41.490
you're at home.

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.910
If you have a memory of
a great-tasting peach,

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.790
you're always in search of
that great-tasting peach.

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.240
So let me just read
just a short passage

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.040
from the beginning
of the book, and this

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.420
is a passage my
daughter wrote called,

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.260
"Learn to Love a Peach."

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.510
We are in love with peaches.

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.140
This peach love and,
consequently, this book

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.290
is not really about
perfection, or rather it is,

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:09.730
but it's a different
kind of perfect.

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.580
A perfect dressed in
hand-me-down clothes

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.500
that passed from
generation to generation.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.570
Maybe there's no
pre-existing perfect peach.

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.180
Instead, maybe a
peach becomes perfect

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.650
when it reminds us of
the deep connections that

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.030
are already present
when we eat one.

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.030
Maybe a perfect
peach wakes us up

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:35.080
through our senses to listen,
appreciate, and champion

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.820
the ways in which we are
interdependent as farmers,

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.040
workers, cooks, and eaters.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.910
This is perfection in
process that I see.

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:48.469
So that gives you a little
flavor of this book.

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:49.260
JASON CRANE: Great.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:50.780
That was a nice reading.

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.540
So to just get into our Q&amp;A,
the title of the book is called,

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:55.857
"The Perfect Peach."

00:05:55.857 --> 00:05:58.440
Can you break that down and talk
about what that really means?

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.440
And I think you started a
little bit with your reading

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.050
right there, but just
elaborate a little bit

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:03.555
on what that means to
you and your family.

00:06:03.555 --> 00:06:04.555
MARCY MASUMOTO: Exactly.

00:06:04.555 --> 00:06:08.430
So to us, the perfect
peach is not just

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.030
that little round ball
of flesh, but it's also

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:15.280
about the story, and the
history, and the place

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.560
that it came from.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.180
And so for us, as
family farmers,

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.280
we feel it is really
important that we

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:27.610
try to connect our fruit and our
place with those that enjoy it.

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:32.170
So the perfect peach
is maybe, in a way,

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:34.220
part of your imagination.

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.120
But in another way,
I think something

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.810
that we seek to enjoy.

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:41.530
And part of our effort
here is not only

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:44.060
sharing the story
about the family

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.220
and the farm and the
practices, but then

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:51.410
how can each of us
use these peaches

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:54.470
other than just
eating out of hand?

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:56.780
The fact that we love
peaches, we're home cooks,

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.060
we're not trained chefs,
but we're home cooks,

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:06.430
and we love peaches, and we
have certainly a large supply

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:07.240
of peaches.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:11.760
And if you have
access to good fruit,

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.520
whether it's in your
neighbor's backyard,

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.990
or you have a favorite
farmer at a farmer's market

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:20.200
that you enjoy
picking up your fruit,

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.230
we would like to
have you celebrate

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:26.200
that fruit in
every type of dish,

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.772
as well as year-round if
you have that opportunity.

00:07:29.772 --> 00:07:30.730
JASON CRANE: Excellent.

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:34.030
So you brought this up a little
earlier with your husband's

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:38.640
first book, and in part of
the beginning of that book,

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.660
you talk about this being
a literary cookbook.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:41.290
MARCY MASUMOTO: Right.

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:42.570
JASON CRANE: You want to
explain a little bit about what

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:44.410
you mean by this being
a literary cookbook?

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:45.300
MARCY MASUMOTO: Sure.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.670
Some of our people
that we've come across

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:49.880
have said that they've
actually taken their cookbook

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:52.200
to bed with them
at night and read

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.130
a chapter or so
before falling asleep.

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:57.180
And the whole idea of the
literary cookbook, it's

00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:59.180
not just a collection
of recipes.

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:00.635
It's more than that.

00:08:00.635 --> 00:08:06.830
It's the stories-- the backstory
of not only the recipe itself,

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:10.430
which each have
headnotes explaining,

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:12.990
where did the inspiration
come from this recipe?

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:15.370
Or is it a family recipe?

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:18.860
But also tying together
through a narrative,

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:21.490
the story about the farm.

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:25.520
If I could share a little
bit about even the table

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:28.040
of contents and the chapters.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.290
So we started with
a peach primer

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:33.850
wanting to share with
others what we've

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:37.280
learned over the years
of raising peaches.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.120
So what is it about peaches?

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:42.760
How do you pick a
Peach when is it ripe?

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:43.890
What are the varieties?

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:45.420
That kind of thing.

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:46.900
But then there's
the next chapter

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.440
is about thirst and sweat.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:52.660
are This is a chapter
about beverages and stories

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:53.820
about work.

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:58.060
And that life on the
farm is not just bucolic,

00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:01.720
and that romantic image
that some people have,

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.300
it's a lot of work.

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:05.400
And so what goes
along with work?

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.570
Well, it's sweat.

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:08.180
And how do you
quench that sweat?

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.500
It's with beverages.

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:12.870
So we've got a great selection
of beverages there too.

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:15.100
Then we've got a
chapter, At the Table,

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:20.220
which includes savory dishes and
stories about family farming.

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:23.850
So we've got a great
variety of savories.

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:27.070
You can't have peach
recipes and peach stories

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:30.060
without Sweet Dreams, or sweets.

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:34.990
So this is a section about
sweet dishes and peach pleasure,

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:39.440
so we love the metaphor
of peaches and love.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.180
And then finally,
Harvest Memories

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:46.530
is the last section, in which
we include stories about legacy,

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:48.450
but also recipes
about preserves.

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:52.980
How do you enjoy that peach
if it's got a short season?

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:55.090
How do you enjoy that
the rest of the year?

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:58.430
And part of our goal there
was to share with others

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:02.190
the simple truth
about how to preserve

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:06.470
your food, whether it's
freezing or canning, or drying.

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:09.574
So it was kind of a little
narrative through the book.

00:10:09.574 --> 00:10:11.490
JASON CRANE: Yeah, it
was an interesting read.

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:15.560
I haven't finished it yet,
but looking through it,

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:18.380
getting prepared for
this, it was interesting

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:22.360
being able to see the stories,
and how the book went along,

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:26.130
and how the recipes matched and
went along with the stories,

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:28.460
and it wasn't just
an encyclopedia

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.460
of how you could use a
peach every way possible.

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:31.460
MARCY MASUMOTO: Exactly.

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:33.490
It's not everything
that is known

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:34.800
in the world about peaches.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.690
It's not an
encyclopedia-type book,

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:41.570
but it's through the eyes of
the growers, and the eaters,

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:42.620
and the home cook.

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:46.390
And I think one of the fun
elements about the book

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:49.660
is the photography, also,
that we purposefully

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:55.720
had the photographer taking
images not only of the dishes,

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:59.727
but also of the farm and
what was going on on the farm

00:10:59.727 --> 00:11:00.560
throughout the year.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:03.680
So we have some
images-- I'm just,

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.320
I should have that
one labeled here--

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:09.900
but images even of thinning
peaches and harvesting,

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:13.870
images during the wintertime
when the trees are dormant,

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:15.170
and they're resting.

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:18.840
And I would like to
think that they're

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:24.860
images that also help
educate our readers

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:28.910
and our eaters of what
is happening on the farm

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:30.064
year-round.

00:11:30.064 --> 00:11:31.730
JASON CRANE: It's not
really a question,

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:33.722
but just to follow up on that.

00:11:33.722 --> 00:11:35.680
You talk in there a little
bit of having agenda

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:37.819
to try to get everyone
to love peaches,

00:11:37.819 --> 00:11:39.860
and I think what we just
talked about right there

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:41.600
and what you were
saying goes along

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.870
those lines of being
your agenda of this book.

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:47.240
To get people to understand
the life of the peach

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.480
and everything that
goes into the farming,

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.260
from your family
to your workers,

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.240
to everything that
goes into bringing

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:54.750
these wonderful
peaches to market.

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:55.749
MARCY MASUMOTO: Exactly.

00:11:55.749 --> 00:11:59.200
That it's both a
labor of labor of love

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:04.240
as well as pure labor that
goes into producing peaches.

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.430
We happen to be a
certified organic farm,

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:10.820
and so our practices
are-- we strive

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:19.880
to be sustainable to raise
fruit that's environmentally

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:24.070
correct, that's not damaging
the earth, that's profitable,

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:25.780
because if it's not
profitable, we're not

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:29.020
going to be in business, and
that's also socially just.

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:31.500
And part of that
is how do we deal

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:34.260
with our workers
and our laborers?

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:35.750
And those are real issues.

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:38.920
What are the
immigration policies,

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:42.530
and how do those impact the
food that we eat every day?

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:46.990
So it's more than just a peach.

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:49.240
JASON CRANE: Well, while
we're talking about organics,

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:50.880
can you talk a
little bit about what

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:52.507
it takes to be an organic farm?

00:12:52.507 --> 00:12:54.340
And since you guys have
been an organic farm

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:56.570
since the '80s, a little
bit of the differences

00:12:56.570 --> 00:13:00.340
that go into what it was back
then to what it entails now.

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:01.600
MARCY MASUMOTO: Sure.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:05.160
Well, when we
transitioned to organic

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:09.940
we were kind of
in the early wave.

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:14.180
There were few people
doing organics,

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:18.720
and those that were
definitely on the fringes.

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:23.680
So in the early years, we
were developing the methods.

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:28.450
Of course, generations
ago, almost all farming

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:33.140
was organic, but then through
the industrial era, everything

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:36.110
switched over to what we now
call conventional farming,

00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:38.310
where it was common
practice to be

00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:40.590
using pesticides and herbicides.

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:44.420
And so as we were transitioning
to becoming organic,

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:48.010
we along with some of our
neighbors had to figure it out.

00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:51.830
How do you live
without chemicals?

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:54.850
For me, it was an
obvious decision.

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:56.830
I live on this farm.

00:13:56.830 --> 00:13:59.630
We have grapes
growing about 20 feet

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:01.870
from the front
door of our house,

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:07.600
and raising children there,
it was an obvious thing for me

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:11.410
to not want to have
chemicals in the front yard.

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:14.610
In a conventional farm if
you're applying pesticides

00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:18.160
or herbicides, you have to
post these signs with the skull

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:24.030
and crossbones on it that
indicate you've sprayed

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:27.330
or that the chemicals
are there to tell you not

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:29.060
to enter the field
for so many days.

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:33.330
And I'm thinking, OK, I've
got a toddler here as far

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:36.430
away as the window
there, can't cross

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:39.120
the line, because there's
chemicals being sprayed there.

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:40.870
And it just didn't make sense.

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:43.850
So at that early stage,
we along with some

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:47.620
of a handful of
friends that were

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:52.320
growers, and some researchers
from the Cooperative Extension

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:57.450
Service, and other
sources, the universities,

00:14:57.450 --> 00:15:01.440
were creating ways to
make organic farming

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:05.240
viable for the types of
products or crops that we grew.

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:06.560
So it's been a long time.

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:09.540
I mean there weren't-- I mean
this is before Whole Foods

00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:11.460
Markets, right?

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:13.717
Today, especially
in urban areas,

00:15:13.717 --> 00:15:16.050
everyone's aware of Whole
Foods, and Whole Foods kind of

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:18.030
has grown up along with us.

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:22.590
We were an early grower for
Whole Foods back in the day.

00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:28.960
We were one of their first
national producers of peaches,

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:31.550
and so as they've
grown, we've grown also.

00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:34.050
But they weren't around
our first couple of years.

00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:36.190
We had to develop markets.

00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:41.460
Our first year of organics all
of our fruit went to baby food.

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:43.330
It was to organic
baby foods, and that's

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:47.270
kind of what got us
through, over the hump,

00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:51.700
I would say, from conventional
farming to organics.

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:54.687
It's been a long haul,
and I think at this point,

00:15:54.687 --> 00:15:56.270
we think we know
what we're doing now.

00:15:58.450 --> 00:15:59.950
JASON CRANE: Yeah,
I guess the skull

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:01.574
and crossbones right
by your front door

00:16:01.574 --> 00:16:03.120
isn't going to
really attract anyone

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:05.612
but maybe pirates to
come visit you, so--

00:16:05.612 --> 00:16:08.070
MARCY MASUMOTO: Pretty scary
thing when you think about it.

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:10.361
JASON CRANE: So while we're
talking about the not using

00:16:10.361 --> 00:16:13.670
chemicals, I was reading that
you guys use pheromones as part

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:15.490
of your abatement to
insects on the farm.

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:16.906
Can we talk a
little bit about how

00:16:16.906 --> 00:16:18.680
pheromones play into
the organic mix?

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:21.620
MARCY MASUMOTO: Yeah, pheromones
are kind of a mysterious thing.

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:24.680
And when we started
applying pheromones,

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:29.610
it was our education to our
kids about sex education.

00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:37.760
So pheromones are the
scent of the insects that

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:40.790
would thrive, for example,
in a peach orchard,

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:46.440
so there's a couple different
insects that damage peaches.

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:51.732
And you chemically
create the scent

00:16:51.732 --> 00:16:56.170
that's applied to a
little plastic strip

00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:58.522
that we hang in the tree.

00:16:58.522 --> 00:17:00.480
Every couple months you
hang them in the trees,

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:03.510
and what that does
is it emits the scent

00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:07.819
so that the male
moth is confused.

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:09.460
It's the scent of the female.

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:12.460
He is attracted to
this, so he never

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:14.579
actually finds the real female.

00:17:14.579 --> 00:17:17.730
So mating doesn't occur,
so eggs aren't laid,

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:21.960
so worms don't grow, and
you have clean fruit.

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:26.240
So it's kind of an
interesting cycle.

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:32.050
But actually a place where
technology has really

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:34.019
played a major role
on the family farm.

00:17:34.019 --> 00:17:35.810
JASON CRANE: Yeah,
that's super interesting

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:37.920
breaking the livestock
cycle versus trying

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.700
to kill individual--

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:42.240
MARCY MASUMOTO: Yeah, if you
wait till you see the worm,

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:43.410
it's too late.

00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:45.420
Because you've got lots
of worms everywhere,

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:47.764
so you want to prevent
that from even happening.

00:17:47.764 --> 00:17:49.680
JASON CRANE: One of the
lines at the beginning

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:52.250
of a chapter in there from
you was, "Start with great,

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:53.350
and end with great."

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:55.320
Can you talk a little bit
about what that means to you?

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:56.190
MARCY MASUMOTO: Oh, sure.

00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:56.898
I'd be delighted.

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:01.320
Say you're going to want
to make a peach pie.

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:03.550
Of course, I think in most
of your minds, you'll say,

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:05.619
I want to make a
really good peach pie.

00:18:05.619 --> 00:18:07.410
Well, if you want to
make a good peach pie,

00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:09.480
you've got to start
with a good peach

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.680
and good primary ingredients.

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:14.990
And with any dish
and any recipe,

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:19.080
I mean why would you want
to start with mediocre?

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:21.110
If you start with
mediocre, then you're

00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:24.330
going to be adding
sugar, and salt, and all

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:27.820
these other things to give
it flavor, which in the end,

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:31.060
doesn't really end up with
a better-tasting dish.

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:34.155
It ends up with something
that looks like peach

00:18:34.155 --> 00:18:35.480
but may not taste like peach.

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:37.750
So the idea that
start with great,

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:40.030
if you have access
to great food.

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:42.560
Here in California
we're so lucky, so

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:48.080
lucky to have access to so many
different types of produce.

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:50.620
And so why not?

00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:54.370
We really don't have
any excuse to not

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:57.312
start with good,
fresh ingredients.

00:18:57.312 --> 00:18:59.260
JASON CRANE: Awesome.

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:01.010
Can you talk to me a
little bit about what

00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:02.320
your responsibilities
are on the farm?

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:03.840
And how you guys
are a family farm,

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:06.975
and I'm sure everyone has their
own responsibilities out there

00:19:06.975 --> 00:19:07.850
to make sure it runs.

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:09.240
Could you talk a little
bit about what you do?

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:09.470
MARCY MASUMOTO: Sure.

00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:10.480
I'd be happy to.

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:12.790
I have two roles
on the family farm.

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:17.540
One is to make sure the farm
is viable year after year

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:21.330
after year after year, which
means that I actually work off

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:23.570
the farm as well as on the farm.

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:28.000
So I am really lucky
that the job that I have.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.170
I'm involved with
the education world,

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:33.509
so I work full-time
during the academic year,

00:19:33.509 --> 00:19:35.050
and during the
summertime I only have

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:39.360
to work limited schedule so that
I have time to work on the farm

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:42.620
when we have the most
work going on on the farm.

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:47.570
Now that doesn't limit my
responsibilities year-round.

00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:50.080
As an owner and a
business person,

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:54.540
we're involved with management
and financial decisions

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:56.910
year-round, and
part of what I do

00:19:56.910 --> 00:20:00.220
is I help select
fruit varieties,

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:01.650
because I'm the cook, right?

00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:04.600
So if I want a
peach that's going

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:09.120
to hold up well
in canning, then I

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:13.480
want to be responsible for
helping make that decision.

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:15.970
So peach selection--
during harvest season

00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:19.730
I am responsible
for packing fruit.

00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:23.870
We do specialty packs
for high-end grocers

00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:27.950
and restaurants, and so
actually, my daughter and I

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:30.870
are out there packing
fruit every day

00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:32.380
throughout the summer.

00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:36.260
That's our job, and we feel
really passionate about that,

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:40.230
because we want the
eaters, the consumers,

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:41.590
to have the best quality fruit.

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:43.310
And the best quality
fruit is something

00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:46.980
that's ripe, or
tree-ripened, and not picked

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:49.390
when it was green
or hard as a rock

00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:52.640
and may never ripen correctly.

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:57.370
So my biggest job
during the summer

00:20:57.370 --> 00:20:59.550
is packing fruit actually.

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:01.920
And testing recipes when I can.

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:02.974
JASON CRANE: Excellent.

00:21:02.974 --> 00:21:04.390
So while we're
talking about this,

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:06.549
talk about what it's like
to actually own a farm

00:21:06.549 --> 00:21:08.090
and what goes into
that a little bit.

00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:12.375
And then what it's like working
with your family all the time

00:21:12.375 --> 00:21:14.130
and being out there
on the family farm.

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:15.921
MARCY MASUMOTO: I'm
curious how many of you

00:21:15.921 --> 00:21:17.980
work with your relatives.

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:18.700
Not too many.

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:19.690
OK, a few.

00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:20.780
Not too many.

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:23.630
It's a little
different feature when

00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:26.920
you are working with your
spouse, working with your kids,

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:30.070
or your children are
working with you.

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:35.480
At this phase, my daughter
is learning all the practices

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:39.080
of farming and working
with her dad every day,

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:41.040
day in and day out.

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:43.840
And that's, think about it.

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:46.390
If you're working with
your parents, you know?

00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:51.280
Some days are great, and
some days it's still bad.

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:56.220
So the family dynamics, I think
overall, are pretty amazing.

00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:57.170
We also have a son.

00:21:57.170 --> 00:22:01.020
I don't want to minimize the
fact that Nikiko has a sibling.

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:03.580
Korio is a little
younger than she is.

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:06.110
He's still in college
and hasn't exactly

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:08.370
decided what he wants to do
yet, but he's really happy

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:10.010
just helping at this point.

00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:12.060
And our daughter,
Nikiko, is certainly

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:14.920
committed to being the
one responsible to ensure

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:17.410
that the farm goes on.

00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:23.790
So working with your family
is a totally different type

00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:26.120
of responsibility.

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:32.100
Farming also can happen
every day of the year.

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:36.050
The nice thing about fruit
is that the trees go dormant

00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:38.290
during the winter,
and so the work

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:40.140
isn't as intense
during the winter.

00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:44.180
I grew up on a
dairy, and for me, we

00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:46.300
had to work every day
of the year regardless,

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:48.260
because you still have
to feed the livestock,

00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:50.010
or you still have
to milk the animals.

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:53.360
And so when I met Mas, it
was like, oh, what a treat.

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:55.720
You get winters off.

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:57.470
So that allows him
a little more time

00:22:57.470 --> 00:23:01.790
to do the paperwork, the
finances, the planning,

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:04.360
and then some
writing on the side.

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:10.120
So owning a farm is more
than just a business, though.

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:14.820
Because we're a
family farm, we don't

00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:16.550
have the corporate mentality.

00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:18.210
We do take things personally.

00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:21.140
We know our workers personally.

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:27.140
We know every corner
of the property

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:29.750
and know which trees are
going to produce a little more

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:32.330
and which ones need
to break this year.

00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:37.490
Or which part of the vineyards
need extra fertilizer

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:39.040
or something like that.

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:40.600
Because we're small
enough, we can

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:45.670
have an intimate relationship
with every part of our farm

00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:49.452
and understand
what its needs are.

00:23:49.452 --> 00:23:50.410
JASON CRANE: Excellent.

00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:52.400
Let's talk a little bit about
peaches for a minute here.

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.150
That's what we're
here for, right?

00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:55.636
So I have a couple questions.

00:23:55.636 --> 00:23:58.260
What are the differences between
yellow flesh and white fleshed

00:23:58.260 --> 00:23:58.999
peaches?

00:23:58.999 --> 00:23:59.790
MARCY MASUMOTO: OK.

00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:01.373
I know that somebody
that talked to me

00:24:01.373 --> 00:24:04.550
earlier had a penchant
for white peaches.

00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:08.870
Happens to be the Masumotos
like yellow flesh peaches

00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:11.530
more what I like about
yellow fleshed peaches

00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:14.770
is that they have an
acid sweet balance,

00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:17.740
that there's a combination,
where white fleshed peach does

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:18.910
not have the acid.

00:24:18.910 --> 00:24:20.190
So it's the sweet.

00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:24.750
You have only the sweet flavor.

00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:26.390
Depending on the
variety, the textures

00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:29.720
might be a little different,
but the primary difference

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:31.940
between the yellow fruit
and the white fruit

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:35.010
is that acid content
in the yellow.

00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:36.349
JASON CRANE: Interesting.

00:24:36.349 --> 00:24:38.140
Can you tell me about
some of the varietals

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:39.425
that you grow on the farm?

00:24:39.425 --> 00:24:40.300
MARCY MASUMOTO: Sure.

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:44.550
We happen to grow a
lot of older varieties.

00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:46.900
Today if you go to the
market, you probably

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:50.770
noticed that in most
markets, they're

00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:53.340
only identified as
yellow or white,

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:55.920
and little do most people
know that, for example,

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:58.040
the yellow fruit,
there are probably

00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:02.120
50 different varieties
of yellow fleshed fruit.

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:05.220
And the variety
will dictate when

00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:08.080
it's available, when it's ripe.

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:11.090
We have seven different
varieties of peaches,

00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:14.720
so our first variety is
called the Spring Lady,

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:19.390
and that will be harvested
mid- to end of May.

00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:23.090
And then our last variety is
the Alberta, which comes usually

00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:25.460
around the 1st of
August, and we've

00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:27.080
got several
varieties in between.

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:31.195
So some of the varieties that
we have-- maybe some of you

00:25:31.195 --> 00:25:32.710
have heard of the
Suncrest peach.

00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:36.800
That's an older variety that
my husband first wrote about

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:41.780
in his book, "Epitaph for a
Peach," but it's a very tangy,

00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:45.540
great-tasting,
out-of-hand-eating peach.

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:49.870
It's great for a salad or
great for something fresh.

00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:53.385
Doesn't hold up well at all if
you're trying to cook with it.

00:25:53.385 --> 00:25:56.550
It actually just falls apart,
whereas the Alberta peach,

00:25:56.550 --> 00:26:00.480
for example, which is another
older heirloom type variety,

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:02.140
is great under heat.

00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:05.120
When you add heat, it
just gets nice and firm,

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:10.130
and maintains its
shape and its texture,

00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:14.290
and is great for pies or
something, or even canning.

00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:18.340
So you want to know
more about varieties?

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:18.990
I'm trying to--

00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:20.510
JASON CRANE: I think we'd all
be a little bit more interested.

00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:20.890
MARCY MASUMOTO: I think
I'm jumping around

00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:22.270
here a little bit.

00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:27.480
But let's see, so we have-- I
should look at the Magnificent

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:29.010
Seven, we call them.

00:26:29.010 --> 00:26:31.420
It would be a good test to
me just to name them all off.

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:32.630
We have Spring Lady.

00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:35.860
We have Gold Dust, which is
another older variety that's

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:38.006
very tender.

00:26:38.006 --> 00:26:41.745
Almost looks like a
very large apricot.

00:26:41.745 --> 00:26:43.980
If you think of an
apricot and how smooth

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:47.870
the skin is compared
to some peaches.

00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:48.930
So there's Gold Dust.

00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:50.510
We have a June Crest.

00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:52.760
We have the Suncrest.

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:55.820
We have a Flavorcrest, so you
can hear the three, the crests.

00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:58.440
They're all somewhat
related, but they're

00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:01.240
kind of mid-season fruit.

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:02.280
And then the Alberta.

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:04.900
Did I miss one?

00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:06.420
Pretty close,
that's about seven.

00:27:08.909 --> 00:27:10.450
JASON CRANE: So in
the book, you talk

00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:11.825
about names of
old friends, and I

00:27:11.825 --> 00:27:14.199
think we talked a little bit
about this with the heirloom

00:27:14.199 --> 00:27:16.080
varieties, but talk a
little bit about what

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:18.780
heirloom varieties
mean for peaches.

00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:21.540
MARCY MASUMOTO: Well, I
think what a lot of consumers

00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:26.820
don't realize is that
as the years go on,

00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:32.290
the growers and the nurserymen
are creating new varieties all

00:27:32.290 --> 00:27:33.000
the time.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.490
And what most often is
found in the marketplace

00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:40.310
are newer varieties,
which are designed

00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:44.560
to be very firm so that they
hold up in refrigeration

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:48.790
and shipping, and lipstick
red color on the outside.

00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:51.480
Well, some of the older
varieties of peaches

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:52.450
aren't that red.

00:27:52.450 --> 00:27:54.190
The Alberta, for
example, is very

00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:57.650
yellow-looking on the outside.

00:27:57.650 --> 00:28:00.230
And there's nothing
wrong with this fruit.

00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:05.420
Part of our goal with growing
older varieties of fruit

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:07.600
is one, they all
have a unique flavor,

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:11.930
and if you lined up several
varieties next to each other,

00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:13.740
you'd really enjoy the nuances.

00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:15.420
And some are more
buttery flavor,

00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:19.100
and some are tangier even
if they're perfectly ripe.

00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:26.940
And what we love is to share
with our consumers, our eaters,

00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:29.930
of all ages, these
older varieties

00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:35.970
so that people have a palate for
what the different flavors are.

00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:38.990
I think a lot of
our younger kids

00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:41.550
and younger eaters
think that peaches

00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:43.840
are supposed to be
hard and crunchy.

00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:46.950
Well, traditionally,
no, that's not the case.

00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:48.690
When a peach is
ripe, it's actually

00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:51.390
relatively soft and sweet.

00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:53.090
And the idea of a
crunchy peach, for me,

00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:56.250
is just like fingers
on a chalkboard.

00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:59.320
But as young people
learn to eat those,

00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:00.640
that's what they're aware of.

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:04.650
And so part of our
passion is to educate

00:29:04.650 --> 00:29:08.185
people about the nuances with
peaches and the varieties.

00:29:08.185 --> 00:29:09.060
JASON CRANE: Awesome.

00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:10.410
I'm learning things
from you today

00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:12.010
already, so you're
passing it on already.

00:29:12.010 --> 00:29:13.090
MARCY MASUMOTO: Oh, good.

00:29:13.090 --> 00:29:14.840
JASON CRANE: This is
probably a quick one,

00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:15.850
but cling and freestone.

00:29:15.850 --> 00:29:17.380
Can you talk a little
bit about the differences

00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:17.870
in those peaches?

00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:18.220
MARCY MASUMOTO: Sure.

00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:19.060
Yeah.

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:21.070
So basically what
we're talking about

00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:24.400
is the pit, the seed in
the middle of the peach,

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:29.970
and how readily it releases
from the flesh of the fruit.

00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:33.390
So there are some fruit
that if you cut around it,

00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:37.870
and you attempted to open it
will just very easily come

00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:39.800
apart, and the
pit just pops out.

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:41.165
That's a freestone peach.

00:29:41.165 --> 00:29:44.080
The stone falls out freely.

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:44.580
Right?

00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:47.090
So as opposed to
what a cling is,

00:29:47.090 --> 00:29:50.900
the cling is the fruit
adheres to that pit.

00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:54.590
If you do any cooking, and
you know a mango, for example.

00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:57.310
You know what that's
like, that the fruit just

00:29:57.310 --> 00:30:01.040
sticks to that seed
inside the mango.

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:03.690
That's what a cling
peach is like.

00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:05.550
You have to cut it off.

00:30:05.550 --> 00:30:09.570
It will never just
slip right off, so.

00:30:09.570 --> 00:30:16.244
Some dishes lend themselves
better to one type than others.

00:30:16.244 --> 00:30:18.660
If you like to work hard, then
you're going to cut it off,

00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:22.030
and you'll use a cling.

00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:26.180
If you're eating it free of
hand, you can eat a cling.

00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:29.890
If you're trying to make
nice, beautiful little slices

00:30:29.890 --> 00:30:36.374
with the red inside portion
that is next to the fruit,

00:30:36.374 --> 00:30:37.790
then you probably
want a freestone

00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:40.282
so that it opens easily, so.

00:30:40.282 --> 00:30:41.240
JASON CRANE: Excellent.

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:41.740
Thank you.

00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:43.927
MARCY MASUMOTO: Part of
the science of peaches.

00:30:43.927 --> 00:30:46.260
JASON CRANE: We were talking
about the different seasons

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:46.880
of your peaches.

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:48.890
Can you talk a little bit about
the difference between early-,

00:30:48.890 --> 00:30:50.290
mid-, and late peaches?

00:30:50.290 --> 00:30:51.740
Is it just the
peach that we get,

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:53.730
or is there something
we should know

00:30:53.730 --> 00:30:56.120
about eating any peach
throughout the season?

00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:59.557
MARCY MASUMOTO: Well,
I think in California--

00:30:59.557 --> 00:31:00.973
because we're in
California, we're

00:31:00.973 --> 00:31:02.840
going to talk about
California fruit.

00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:06.830
So typically the season
for peaches in California

00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:11.350
is May through September.

00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:14.870
So the earlier
fruit is not going

00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:18.490
to have as much time to
mature and develop sugars.

00:31:18.490 --> 00:31:22.370
So it typically earlier
fruit are not quite as sweet

00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:26.670
or as sugary as the mid-season
or later season fruit.

00:31:26.670 --> 00:31:28.950
And again, it just
depends on the variety

00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:31.770
in terms of the
sweet tart ratio,

00:31:31.770 --> 00:31:35.350
and or what other particular
characteristics the fruit

00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:36.210
might have.

00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:40.060
It's like if you had
a chardonnay wine,

00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:42.650
but six different
versions of chardonnay,

00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:45.580
you're still going to have
a spectrum of some sweeter

00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:48.520
and some is more drier flavor.

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:50.694
So similar with fruit.

00:31:50.694 --> 00:31:51.360
JASON CRANE: OK.

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:53.776
Well, that's kind of a little
segue into something else we

00:31:53.776 --> 00:31:56.460
were going to talk about--
the regionality of peaches.

00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:59.600
Can you talk a little bit
about not just the California,

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:02.990
but peaches other places, and
a little bit about the climates

00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:04.760
and microclimates
and the terroir

00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:07.120
that does add these different
flavors to the peaches.

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:07.995
MARCY MASUMOTO: Sure.

00:32:07.995 --> 00:32:11.140
Well, I have to say, I've been
a Californian all my life.

00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:15.210
So there might be
people in the audience

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:18.110
or viewers that
are from Georgia,

00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:22.880
or Michigan, or Pennsylvania, or
other states that grow peaches,

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:26.380
and I can't speak
to those peaches.

00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:31.310
But I will tell you that
the soil and the climate

00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:33.850
will make a difference as to
one, what kind of varieties

00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:38.900
will grow well there, and two,
what the flavor is going to be.

00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:41.820
Even on our farm,
on our 80 acres,

00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:44.570
if we plant the same
variety on one end of the 80

00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:49.190
acres versus the other end,
if the soil type is different,

00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:51.740
the flavors of the peaches
will be somewhat different.

00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:54.430
And it'll also
depend on fertilizers

00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:56.440
and other cultural practices.

00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:59.940
But peaches are one
of those fruit that

00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:05.200
are very adaptable
to the environment.

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:10.370
So what's beautiful about the
Central Valley, where we live,

00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:12.520
is it's very hot, dry climate.

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:15.540
Peaches love hot, dry climate.

00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:18.920
Now if you're in Georgia, it's
hot, but it's not always dry.

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:22.020
So it'd probably would be other
varieties that grow better

00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:25.719
in that environment
than here in California.

00:33:25.719 --> 00:33:26.760
JASON CRANE: Interesting.

00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:30.182
You just-- part of what I
see at the grocery store

00:33:30.182 --> 00:33:31.890
is the same thing you
were talking about,

00:33:31.890 --> 00:33:33.630
where even doesn't
matter what store

00:33:33.630 --> 00:33:36.160
you go into unless you go to
an actual farmer's market,

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:38.990
you're going to see
white and yellow peach

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:40.650
and not really
realize that there

00:33:40.650 --> 00:33:43.704
are as many varieties
of them as there are.

00:33:43.704 --> 00:33:45.870
Can you talk a little bit
about ripeness in a peach?

00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:48.349
What are we looking for when
we're looking for ripeness?

00:33:48.349 --> 00:33:49.390
MARCY MASUMOTO: Ripeness?

00:33:49.390 --> 00:33:52.455
Well, first off,
the first question

00:33:52.455 --> 00:33:56.970
that I ask when I'm even trying
to determine the ripeness I

00:33:56.970 --> 00:33:59.410
want is, what am I
going to do with it?

00:33:59.410 --> 00:34:01.660
So if I'm wanting
to make a sauce,

00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:04.580
if I'm wanting to make
jam, I want really what

00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:06.100
we call a gusher.

00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:10.739
I want a fruit that
is so ready to go

00:34:10.739 --> 00:34:12.980
that when you bite
into it, the juice just

00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:15.840
squirts out of your mouth.

00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:19.139
You don't always find that
in the grocery store though.

00:34:19.139 --> 00:34:23.650
So again, this is where if
you a grower or have somebody

00:34:23.650 --> 00:34:27.070
at a farmer's market that can
give you tree-ripened fruit,

00:34:27.070 --> 00:34:29.330
and then if you want to
leave it out for a while,

00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:31.130
then it'll even be riper.

00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:33.274
If you want something
that's going to be crunchy,

00:34:33.274 --> 00:34:36.239
if you want that
tartness in your salad,

00:34:36.239 --> 00:34:37.670
you might want a greener fruit.

00:34:37.670 --> 00:34:44.560
So what I look for in ripeness
is two things-- how it feels

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:46.710
and what we call the
background color.

00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:52.590
So the feel of the
fruit is critical.

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:54.900
Remember those old
commercials about,

00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:56.800
I think there was a
brand of toilet paper

00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:59.810
where they're talking about how
it feels, how soft it feels?

00:34:59.810 --> 00:35:03.540
And in a way, if you're
looking for the right fruit,

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:08.260
you do need to gingerly
feel that fruit

00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:11.860
with your fingertips, with just
the pads of your fingertips.

00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:15.680
Now if as you're squeezing
that fruit gently,

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:21.060
if your fingertips
sink into that fruit,

00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:24.420
you know that that is ripe, and
you'd better take that one home

00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:27.004
with you, because you just left
your fingerprints on it too.

00:35:27.004 --> 00:35:29.170
And probably the next person
isn't going to want it,

00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:35.010
but that's the fruit that I love
that is really, really soft.

00:35:35.010 --> 00:35:38.810
So the ripeness-- if it
feels hard to the touch,

00:35:38.810 --> 00:35:41.790
I mean hard like a
baseball, leave it.

00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:46.230
It may never get ripe.

00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:48.270
But the second thing
that you'd look for

00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:50.270
is what we call the
background color.

00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:55.420
So if you're looking at
the stem end of your fruit,

00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:57.820
of course the stem,
there is no stem.

00:35:57.820 --> 00:35:58.850
It's not like an apple.

00:35:58.850 --> 00:36:01.160
An apple, the stem's
always in the apple.

00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:04.640
But when you pick a peach,
the stem remains on the tree.

00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:07.320
But if you're looking
at the stem end,

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:09.600
the color around
that end is going

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:11.650
to give you a really
good indicator

00:36:11.650 --> 00:36:14.255
of how ripe that speech is.

00:36:14.255 --> 00:36:19.110
If there are green tinges
to that, it's green.

00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:21.070
It's not quite ripe.

00:36:21.070 --> 00:36:27.210
What I look for is a golden
yellow, kind of that color.

00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:30.210
It looks like some
of these chairs here,

00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:33.180
not the green ones, but
the golden ones here.

00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:37.510
You'd want to look for that
background color for ripeness.

00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:39.470
If it's yellow, kind
of a neutral yellow,

00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:44.360
it'll probably ripen
on your counter.

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:46.270
Refrigeration is not
good for peaches.

00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:47.360
It's like tomatoes.

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:54.380
One, it'll stop the ripening,
and maybe that's what you want.

00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:57.690
But if they've been
refrigerated too long,

00:36:57.690 --> 00:37:00.890
they're going to become mushy
and mealy and dehydrated.

00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:03.890
The best peaches are those
that are left on the counter

00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:08.935
and can ripen on
your window sill.

00:37:08.935 --> 00:37:10.310
JASON CRANE: As
a little segue, I

00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:12.559
was going to ask you what
we should know about storing

00:37:12.559 --> 00:37:14.600
and ripening peaches,
and maybe not just

00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:18.870
about what we as consumers
do, but what other producers

00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:21.875
do when they don't actually
ripen fruit on the tree.

00:37:21.875 --> 00:37:22.750
MARCY MASUMOTO: Yeah.

00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:29.380
Well, traditionally peaches
are always hand-picked.

00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:34.970
It's one of the products
that's not machine-picked yet

00:37:34.970 --> 00:37:36.230
at this point in time.

00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:37.950
They're hand-picked.

00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:40.780
Conventionally, if you're
talking big growers

00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:44.420
and oftentimes, they're
picked very green.

00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:46.600
They're dumped into big bins.

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:48.540
They go to the packing house.

00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:49.280
They roll.

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:50.380
They're dumped out.

00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:52.990
They roll down
the conveyor belts

00:37:52.990 --> 00:37:56.320
and are sorted and
sized, all mechanically,

00:37:56.320 --> 00:38:03.770
and boxed into double or triple
layer boxes, refrigerated, held

00:38:03.770 --> 00:38:08.180
under refrigeration for
who knows how long really?

00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:11.140
Because in California,
our produce

00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:12.910
is shipped all
across the country.

00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:15.520
Well, the longer it's in
refrigeration, the more likely

00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:18.480
it's going to dehydrate,
and the more likely

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:24.290
it will never ripen if it's been
under long-term refrigeration.

00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:27.690
The riper the fruit is, of
course, the more gingerly you

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:29.940
need to handle it.

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:33.850
So for the specialty-packed
fruit that we do, for example,

00:38:33.850 --> 00:38:37.290
we pick them by hand,
put them in a box that

00:38:37.290 --> 00:38:41.360
are at most double layer
high so that they're not

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:46.360
laying on top of each other
and pressuring each other.

00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:50.180
We hand-pick that
peach out of the what

00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:57.560
we call the picked box, examine
it for flaws or blemishes,

00:38:57.560 --> 00:39:03.480
and place it single layer into
a box that's got dividers in it

00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:05.290
so that they're
not rolling around,

00:39:05.290 --> 00:39:10.435
and that goes straight
to our buyers,

00:39:10.435 --> 00:39:12.560
and they're usually in the
marketplace the next day

00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:13.640
or the day after.

00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:17.140
So because that they're
not refrigerated long,

00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:19.590
they might be cooled
down to kind of slow down

00:39:19.590 --> 00:39:23.800
the ripening process, but if
they're already tree-ripened,

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:27.737
you want people to get those
in their hands right away.

00:39:27.737 --> 00:39:29.070
JASON CRANE: Yeah, that's great.

00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:31.570
So then when we get home, either
storing them on the counter

00:39:31.570 --> 00:39:34.012
if they're not quite ripe,
or if they really are,

00:39:34.012 --> 00:39:35.970
just go at them and eat
them right away, right?

00:39:35.970 --> 00:39:36.890
MARCY MASUMOTO:
Well, the best thing

00:39:36.890 --> 00:39:38.980
is if they're ripe, eat
them, use them right away.

00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:41.670
Now if you can't, and you want
to slow down the ripening,

00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:43.790
because they're there
especially ripe,

00:39:43.790 --> 00:39:47.910
put them in the refrigerator,
but get them out

00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:49.690
of the refrigerator soon.

00:39:49.690 --> 00:39:53.690
Don't leave them in
there for a week or so.

00:39:53.690 --> 00:39:56.430
You want to use their peaches
when they're at their peak.

00:39:56.430 --> 00:40:01.087
So the less time in
refrigeration, the better.

00:40:01.087 --> 00:40:02.920
JASON CRANE: I was
reading through the book,

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:04.500
and it talked about
the chill hours.

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:07.335
And can you explain a little bit
what that means to the peaches?

00:40:07.335 --> 00:40:08.210
MARCY MASUMOTO: Yeah.

00:40:08.210 --> 00:40:10.240
We like to think of
chill hours, which

00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:13.030
is during the dormancy
season during the winter.

00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:16.460
So different
varieties of peaches

00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:21.550
actually require so many
hours of temperatures

00:40:21.550 --> 00:40:24.630
below 45 degrees,
around 800 hours

00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:29.920
over the winter from
October to February or so,

00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:34.250
which allows the tree
to really get some rest.

00:40:34.250 --> 00:40:37.240
What we like to call it
is a good solid sleep.

00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:40.450
When you've been working
hard a long stretch,

00:40:40.450 --> 00:40:43.580
if you don't get a good
solid sleep sooner or later,

00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:46.770
you're going to wake up
grumpy, and you might not

00:40:46.770 --> 00:40:48.660
be as productive as
you'd like to be.

00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:55.300
So with our peaches, they really
need a nice solid winter rest,

00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:58.570
to sleep, cold temperatures.

00:40:58.570 --> 00:41:02.710
This winter we had
kind of a warm winter,

00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:06.000
so hopefully the season
will be good this year.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.740
Typically if they've got
a good solid 800 hours

00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:12.910
of cold temperatures,
the flavors

00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:14.890
tend to be better
during the year.

00:41:14.890 --> 00:41:16.040
So we'll see.

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:23.240
It's been so dry also that we've
noticed that the soils are just

00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:24.870
sucking up the moisture now.

00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:28.640
We've watered more
frequently than we have ever

00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:34.330
in our last 30 years,
and just with the drought

00:41:34.330 --> 00:41:36.640
and the dryness.

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:41.875
Those trees are just inhaling
the water that they get.

00:41:41.875 --> 00:41:43.750
JASON CRANE: So the last
chapter in your book

00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:45.250
you were talking
about preservation.

00:41:45.250 --> 00:41:48.960
You want to talk a little bit
about what goes into that,

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:52.144
or why you see the value
of preserving foods?

00:41:52.144 --> 00:41:53.060
MARCY MASUMOTO: Right.

00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:55.660
One of the things while we
were working on this cookbook

00:41:55.660 --> 00:42:02.900
was we basically were asked to
get the book done in 18 months.

00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:07.100
And we asked our publishers to
stretch it over to two years

00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:09.420
so that we would
have two full harvest

00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:11.510
seasons to test recipes.

00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:13.880
And why is that important?

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:17.230
It was important to us, because
during the winter months, when

00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:20.320
we went to the grocery
store and bought produce

00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:22.350
that came from South
America, because that was

00:42:22.350 --> 00:42:28.760
the only place that produce was
being harvested at that time,

00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:30.630
but by the time they
got to our market,

00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:33.930
and by the time I got them
home, at least four out of five,

00:42:33.930 --> 00:42:35.380
I was throwing away.

00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:38.680
They were mealy,
they were brown.

00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:41.930
They looked fine on the
outside, but you cut into them,

00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:44.450
and you really did
not want to eat them.

00:42:44.450 --> 00:42:46.700
So that's part of the backstory.

00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:50.460
The other part is I grew
up on a farm myself.

00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:55.440
My folks were from the Midwest
and god Depression-era folks,

00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:59.850
and learned how to preserve
all types of foods.

00:42:59.850 --> 00:43:03.120
And so at an early age,
I learned how to can,

00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:05.580
and I brought some
examples here today

00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:08.430
if anybody wants to take a look.

00:43:08.430 --> 00:43:11.320
So some of the things that you
can do with peaches, canning.

00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:15.319
This is probably a pretty
typical idea of jarred.

00:43:15.319 --> 00:43:16.860
I guess people today
are calling them

00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:20.970
jarred, but a half
type of peach.

00:43:20.970 --> 00:43:25.980
Also have done and included
recipes for pickled peaches,

00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:30.290
which are great-- oops, I'm
sorry-- a great accompaniment.

00:43:30.290 --> 00:43:35.470
But these are whole peaches
that have some spices in them.

00:43:35.470 --> 00:43:39.170
But during the wintertime,
oh, it's so lovely.

00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:43.530
Thanksgiving, have turkey with
a pickled peach next to it,

00:43:43.530 --> 00:43:45.300
and it just reminds
you of summertime,

00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:47.910
and it's just so delightful.

00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:50.530
Also then, I've
got some other kind

00:43:50.530 --> 00:43:52.220
of California-style recipes.

00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:56.060
There's a peach salsa, which
a peach and tomato salsa,

00:43:56.060 --> 00:43:57.530
which is also a treat.

00:43:57.530 --> 00:44:00.390
And then I've got
some chutney, which

00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:06.930
is a spiced kind of chopped
peach with raisins in it.

00:44:06.930 --> 00:44:09.640
I include gold-- I
include dark raisins,

00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:11.690
because that's what we grow.

00:44:11.690 --> 00:44:14.070
So that's a lot of fun.

00:44:14.070 --> 00:44:19.130
But what we wanted to encourage
people through the cookbook

00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:22.376
is again, if you have
access to good fruit,

00:44:22.376 --> 00:44:23.750
then why not do
something with it

00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:25.270
so you can enjoy it year-round?

00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:29.600
So we've also included how
to dehydrate your peaches

00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:32.700
if you want to do that, or
how to freeze the peaches.

00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:34.080
It's so easy.

00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:36.900
It's really easy, and if
you've never canned before,

00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:38.540
do not be afraid of canning.

00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:41.480
It's a pretty easy process.

00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:44.305
If I can do it,
anybody can do it.

00:44:44.305 --> 00:44:45.180
JASON CRANE: Awesome.

00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:45.780
Thanks for that.

00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:47.321
Is there anyone who
has any questions

00:44:47.321 --> 00:44:49.447
out here today for us?

00:44:49.447 --> 00:44:51.280
AUDIENCE: So when peach
season comes around,

00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:54.280
I always try to pay attention at
Berkeley Bowl for the Masumoto

00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:56.990
peaches, but I'm
wondering, do you

00:44:56.990 --> 00:45:01.330
have any kind of email
notification that you send out?

00:45:01.330 --> 00:45:03.149
Or do you ship directly now?

00:45:03.149 --> 00:45:04.940
MARCY MASUMOTO: Oh,
that's a good question.

00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:08.050
So she was asking, she shops
at Berkeley Bowl, which

00:45:08.050 --> 00:45:12.690
happens to be one of our really
terrific long-time markets

00:45:12.690 --> 00:45:15.070
that we've worked with,
and we do ship directly

00:45:15.070 --> 00:45:16.660
to Berkeley Bowl.

00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:18.990
And those peaches are the
ones that I and my daughter

00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:23.690
have hand-packed, so you're
pretty lucky to get some.

00:45:23.690 --> 00:45:27.520
But yeah, if you want to
log on to our website,

00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:31.130
we do have a newsletter,
and my daughter also

00:45:31.130 --> 00:45:36.230
tweets when the fruit's
going to be delivered up here

00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:37.460
in the East Bay.

00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:39.360
And so you can
find out then when

00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:42.720
it's arriving to Berkeley
Bowl or a few other places.

00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:47.820
And if you're someplace
else, because we're

00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:54.810
too small to be shipping
things by the huge lots,

00:45:54.810 --> 00:45:59.820
but we're too big to know where
all of our fruit is going.

00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:02.290
So if you happen to be
at some other market,

00:46:02.290 --> 00:46:04.650
and you see the
Masumoto fruit and let

00:46:04.650 --> 00:46:07.210
us know that we can tweet it
out to other folks too that,

00:46:07.210 --> 00:46:09.469
oh, it showed up over at
this market in this city.

00:46:09.469 --> 00:46:11.010
JASON CRANE: My last
question for you

00:46:11.010 --> 00:46:12.794
is how was your
day here at Google?

00:46:12.794 --> 00:46:14.210
Tell me a little
bit about what it

00:46:14.210 --> 00:46:16.650
was like for you seeing
our cafe in action

00:46:16.650 --> 00:46:18.950
and how our chefs
cooked up peaches

00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:20.867
to your recipes and
their own recipes,

00:46:20.867 --> 00:46:22.200
and just what was your day like?

00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:23.950
MARCY MASUMOTO: Oh,
I was so delighted.

00:46:23.950 --> 00:46:26.210
From the moment I walked
in the door today,

00:46:26.210 --> 00:46:32.870
it was just really a
delightful day, from the chefs

00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:36.950
and the staff in the cafe, and
what they did was beautiful.

00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:40.620
They made some recipes
directly from the book.

00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:42.570
They also took some
and tweaked them,

00:46:42.570 --> 00:46:44.430
which is exactly
what a recipe is.

00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:46.300
It's like a guideline, right?

00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:51.010
So take an idea,
and then go with it.

00:46:51.010 --> 00:46:53.970
And the fact that
here we are in April,

00:46:53.970 --> 00:46:55.840
and they found some
peaches and did

00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:58.080
some pretty remarkable
things with those.

00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:02.730
They also used some
of our dried peaches,

00:47:02.730 --> 00:47:04.310
and that was a real treat.

00:47:04.310 --> 00:47:09.640
But it's totally amazing to
me what happens here at Google

00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:12.170
and how lucky all of you are.

00:47:12.170 --> 00:47:16.130
The care that goes into
the selection of the food,

00:47:16.130 --> 00:47:20.840
and the preparation, and I know
Bon Appetit Management Company

00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:24.430
helps oversee the food
service, and their commitment

00:47:24.430 --> 00:47:28.210
to high-quality
food, because it's

00:47:28.210 --> 00:47:30.680
nourishing the body,
the soul, the mind.

00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:33.540
It's not just food.

00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:38.360
I think that food is a special
thing, because you take it

00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:41.900
in to your body, and what could
be more personal than that?

00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:45.390
And the fact that
a company this size

00:47:45.390 --> 00:47:48.280
cares so much about
their employees

00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:53.900
to provide not only some
food, but great food,

00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:56.020
and it was cooked to perfection.

00:47:56.020 --> 00:48:01.190
I was so mind-boggled.

00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:02.430
It's really wonderful.

00:48:02.430 --> 00:48:03.555
What a great opportunity.

00:48:03.555 --> 00:48:04.680
JASON CRANE: Well, awesome.

00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:07.135
It was really great having
you out here today, Marcy.

00:48:07.135 --> 00:48:08.010
Pleasure to meet you.

00:48:08.010 --> 00:48:11.030
I look forward to hunting
my farmer's markets

00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:14.550
and wherever I can to find
your peaches this summer.

00:48:14.550 --> 00:48:16.986
And have a great rest
of your, and really,

00:48:16.986 --> 00:48:18.360
thanks for coming
out here today.

00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:19.985
MARCY MASUMOTO: My
pleasure to be here.

00:48:19.985 --> 00:48:21.760
Thank you so much.
