00:00:12.756 --> 00:00:16.589
- Our next session is
gonna be also different.

00:00:17.614 --> 00:00:19.435
We're gonna look at music therapy.

00:00:19.435 --> 00:00:21.289
This is something that came from

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:23.214
our planning and advisory committee,

00:00:23.214 --> 00:00:26.631
and a family that I work with recommended

00:00:27.983 --> 00:00:31.135
our next speaker so I'm
really excited to hear.

00:00:31.135 --> 00:00:34.795
Pierre Brennan is a board
certified music therapist.

00:00:34.795 --> 00:00:36.814
He's a board certified behavior analyst

00:00:36.814 --> 00:00:40.173
and the founding director
of Behavioral Rhythms

00:00:40.173 --> 00:00:41.926
and a developmental coach at

00:00:41.926 --> 00:00:45.254
the Autism Center of Northern California.

00:00:45.254 --> 00:00:48.797
He received his master's degree
in neurologic music therapy

00:00:48.797 --> 00:00:51.982
from Colorado State University
and has a bachelor's degree

00:00:51.982 --> 00:00:54.323
from UCLA in physiologic science

00:00:54.323 --> 00:00:58.650
with additional studies
in ethnomusicology.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.130
As a Peace Corps volunteer in West Africa

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.255
he collaborated with UNICEF,

00:01:03.255 --> 00:01:05.737
the Safe Motherhood and
Child Survival Project,

00:01:05.737 --> 00:01:09.904
and studied the drumming culture
of Konkomba warrior tribes.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.566
Pierre, please join us.

00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:16.733
(audience applauding)

00:01:21.894 --> 00:01:25.961
- Alright great, well it's
a pleasure to be here.

00:01:25.961 --> 00:01:28.407
Earlier Dennis and Matthew
were talking about inspiration

00:01:28.407 --> 00:01:32.205
and it made me think back when
I was in elementary school,

00:01:32.205 --> 00:01:34.308
they actually brought me into,

00:01:34.308 --> 00:01:38.124
had me spend some time in
a classroom with children

00:01:38.124 --> 00:01:40.986
with special needs and
developmental disabilities.

00:01:40.986 --> 00:01:43.651
And I had no idea, you
know later my entire career

00:01:43.651 --> 00:01:47.412
would be based on that
experience, so it's incredible.

00:01:47.412 --> 00:01:49.123
You plant a seed and you have no idea

00:01:49.123 --> 00:01:51.985
how that's gonna develop over time.

00:01:51.985 --> 00:01:53.349
So yeah, inspiration is such an

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:56.266
important component to all of this.

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.592
So, let me get the, here we go.

00:02:04.576 --> 00:02:08.344
So, after college I
needed some inspiration,

00:02:08.344 --> 00:02:10.761
so I took the logical step of

00:02:12.317 --> 00:02:16.025
going to live in an isolated village

00:02:16.025 --> 00:02:17.430
in the middle of Africa.

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.982
(audience laughing)

00:02:19.982 --> 00:02:22.358
So my background is in
physiology and I also studied

00:02:22.358 --> 00:02:25.529
ethnomusicology, the
study of musical culture.

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:27.342
So I thought I could join the Peace Corps,

00:02:27.342 --> 00:02:29.250
work on community health issues,

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.417
and also study the musical
culture of an African tribe.

00:02:34.274 --> 00:02:37.387
When I went to Togo, I said
I really want to study.

00:02:37.387 --> 00:02:40.470
I want to live with a culture that is

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:44.278
kind of like the most pure
culture and they said,

00:02:44.278 --> 00:02:47.414
we know exactly where you need to go.

00:02:47.414 --> 00:02:50.959
This one village in the north, Kidjaboun,

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.818
and the tribe that lived in
that area was a warrior tribe.

00:02:55.818 --> 00:02:58.920
If you look down at Lome
down on the coast there

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.706
and there's a nice red line that goes

00:03:01.706 --> 00:03:03.647
straight up through the north.

00:03:03.647 --> 00:03:05.349
And the road was actually gonna go,

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:08.754
kinda head toward Bassar
and go through Gerin-Kuka

00:03:08.754 --> 00:03:10.576
near where that red arrow is.

00:03:10.576 --> 00:03:13.146
But the Konkomba lived
there so when the Germans

00:03:13.146 --> 00:03:15.268
brought their first battalion through

00:03:15.268 --> 00:03:19.049
they were able to make all the different

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.196
chiefs in all these villages going up.

00:03:22.196 --> 00:03:24.357
They would give them
alcohol and they said,

00:03:24.357 --> 00:03:26.445
sure, that sounds great keep on going.

00:03:26.445 --> 00:03:30.437
When they landed in the
area of the Konkomba

00:03:30.437 --> 00:03:34.082
they refused to participate in anything

00:03:34.082 --> 00:03:38.103
that they had to offer so they wiped out

00:03:38.103 --> 00:03:40.723
that first battalion
with their poison arrows.

00:03:40.723 --> 00:03:42.488
The Germans brought another battalion

00:03:42.488 --> 00:03:43.845
through and they wiped those out,

00:03:43.845 --> 00:03:46.165
wiped all of them out too as well.

00:03:46.165 --> 00:03:48.665
So now the road actually goes,

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.968
it goes to the right in Kara and cuts over

00:03:52.968 --> 00:03:56.135
so that whole region doesn't have any,

00:03:58.028 --> 00:04:01.226
they don't get supplies, there
are no roads, no electricity.

00:04:01.226 --> 00:04:05.917
I've recently spoken to
a friend in the capital,

00:04:05.917 --> 00:04:08.510
and he said we have cell phones now.

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.010
I'm like, oh that's great.

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.239
And he said, I'm like, how
do you charge it though?

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:13.593
He's like car batteries.

00:04:13.593 --> 00:04:14.845
Okay, that makes sense,

00:04:14.845 --> 00:04:18.178
we have cell phones, but no electricity.

00:04:21.943 --> 00:04:26.496
And when I was in a
village, it was 700 people,

00:04:26.496 --> 00:04:30.027
all one family, essentially the story goes

00:04:30.027 --> 00:04:33.516
that one man flew over the land
and he saw the water source

00:04:33.516 --> 00:04:37.099
and so he landed there
and took on probably

00:04:39.342 --> 00:04:41.666
seven to eight wives and had 40 kids

00:04:41.666 --> 00:04:43.558
and two or three generations later,

00:04:43.558 --> 00:04:47.163
you have a village of 700, all one family.

00:04:47.163 --> 00:04:52.113
And people would find their,
husbands would find their wives

00:04:52.113 --> 00:04:55.946
from outside villages
during farmers' markets.

00:04:58.361 --> 00:05:03.084
One thing I discovered, and
talking about inspiration,

00:05:03.084 --> 00:05:05.267
when all the adults would go
off to the fields and work,

00:05:05.267 --> 00:05:09.269
all the kids would come
to the white guy's house.

00:05:09.269 --> 00:05:11.990
They, once again, the
Konkomba are very hesitant

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.760
to send their children to school,

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.939
anything that had to do with white people.

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:18.207
One time we were all sitting under a tree

00:05:18.207 --> 00:05:20.950
and they said, (speaking
in foreign language),

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.669
was the word for white man,
and we're sitting there,

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:26.564
and I'm about a year
into my service there.

00:05:26.564 --> 00:05:28.371
And they were talking about
(speaking in foreign language).

00:05:28.371 --> 00:05:29.810
I'm like come on guys, my name is Pierre,

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:31.330
and they're like oh no, no, no.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:32.810
We're talking about the government.

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.445
I'm like oh, white man and the government

00:05:34.445 --> 00:05:37.605
is the same word, I got it, so.

00:05:37.605 --> 00:05:40.605
(audience laughing)

00:05:41.769 --> 00:05:45.726
But one thing I realized
when I was in that village,

00:05:45.726 --> 00:05:50.248
children are like sponges,
they are just ready to learn.

00:05:50.248 --> 00:05:52.833
And we, as professionals,

00:05:52.833 --> 00:05:56.916
we have to figure out a
way to connect with them.

00:05:59.546 --> 00:06:04.130
And music is such a great
way to connect with people.

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:08.039
There's a famous
ethnomusicologist, John Blacking,

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:10.160
who talked about the
different functions of music.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.974
Often times in the West,
music tends to be more of a,

00:06:13.974 --> 00:06:17.308
it's like an entertainment,
we watch videos on YouTube

00:06:17.308 --> 00:06:19.967
and we have, I have my
entire music catalog

00:06:19.967 --> 00:06:22.384
on my phone which is amazing.

00:06:23.829 --> 00:06:25.613
We go to concerts, every
time we watch movies,

00:06:25.613 --> 00:06:27.051
there's music in the background.

00:06:27.051 --> 00:06:29.069
But also we can make music.

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:31.736
In Africa, it was something that

00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:36.039
everyone participated in, in music making.

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:40.206
Every male in the village could
play drums amazingly well.

00:06:43.547 --> 00:06:45.394
When I first came into my village,

00:06:45.394 --> 00:06:49.284
I brought a little tiny drum
I'd bought in the capital,

00:06:49.284 --> 00:06:51.701
a little tiny djembe drum, that
was actually the first time

00:06:51.701 --> 00:06:53.373
they ever saw a djembe drum,

00:06:53.373 --> 00:06:55.857
I actually introduced
an African djembe drum

00:06:55.857 --> 00:06:59.524
to an African village
which was kind of odd.

00:07:01.646 --> 00:07:04.872
And I played my little rhythm
and I went back into the house

00:07:04.872 --> 00:07:07.728
and here's a four year old
boy and they started playing

00:07:07.728 --> 00:07:09.706
my exact rhythm that I was playing.

00:07:09.706 --> 00:07:12.135
And I've been playing drums for 17 years,

00:07:12.135 --> 00:07:14.094
I thought I was pretty decent,
and here's a little boy

00:07:14.094 --> 00:07:16.832
totally playing exactly what I did,

00:07:16.832 --> 00:07:18.400
and they're all laughing, they're like oh,

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.062
here's the white guy's rhythm.

00:07:21.062 --> 00:07:22.970
(audience laughing)

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:23.803
Yeah, so.

00:07:26.063 --> 00:07:29.396
And so, this picture was taken during a,

00:07:31.366 --> 00:07:33.787
in the sacred forest during a rain dance.

00:07:33.787 --> 00:07:35.188
Actually I didn't know
where this forest was,

00:07:35.188 --> 00:07:38.907
it was about a year and
a half into my time there

00:07:38.907 --> 00:07:42.241
when they actually showed me where it was.

00:07:42.241 --> 00:07:44.462
And you can see in the middle
they have this huge drum.

00:07:44.462 --> 00:07:46.257
And that drum just echos,

00:07:46.257 --> 00:07:48.182
you can hear that for miles, actually.

00:07:48.182 --> 00:07:49.370
When they have a dance like this,

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:52.665
you can hear it for miles around.

00:07:52.665 --> 00:07:55.309
And there's some circles in the middle,

00:07:55.309 --> 00:07:56.980
all the women, it goes by height.

00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:59.963
So the tallest woman all
the way down to little girls

00:07:59.963 --> 00:08:03.602
at the end and there's
also a circle of men.

00:08:03.602 --> 00:08:05.616
And they were singing
and the drums going on

00:08:05.616 --> 00:08:08.842
at the same time, it's
a pretty amazing thing.

00:08:08.842 --> 00:08:11.648
When there's funerals,
which are celebrations,

00:08:11.648 --> 00:08:15.399
if someone's old enough and had a family,

00:08:15.399 --> 00:08:18.206
this will go on for three
days, if someone passes,

00:08:18.206 --> 00:08:21.956
the Konkomba will launch
this huge explosion,

00:08:23.804 --> 00:08:25.742
you'll hear it from five miles away,

00:08:25.742 --> 00:08:26.808
first thing in the morning,

00:08:26.808 --> 00:08:28.731
and that means that no one
does anything for three days.

00:08:28.731 --> 00:08:30.890
So imagine if all of a
sudden you got something

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:33.557
on your phone and said someone
passed away in this village

00:08:33.557 --> 00:08:36.492
and you don't have,
you're just gonna gather

00:08:36.492 --> 00:08:38.286
with all your friends
for the next three days,

00:08:38.286 --> 00:08:40.730
and no one's gonna go to work.

00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:44.230
So in this village, life came before work.

00:08:47.355 --> 00:08:49.391
And in terms of inspiration,

00:08:49.391 --> 00:08:52.125
I really thought about
just the power of music

00:08:52.125 --> 00:08:54.773
and how music can unify people.

00:08:54.773 --> 00:08:58.193
But there's also many
different functions of music.

00:08:58.193 --> 00:09:02.360
You use music to teach as well
as to connect with others.

00:09:06.796 --> 00:09:08.990
So let's talk about music therapy here.

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:11.848
Music therapy is the clinical
and evidence-based use

00:09:11.848 --> 00:09:15.769
of musical interventions to
accomplish individualized goals

00:09:15.769 --> 00:09:17.807
within a therapeutic relationship

00:09:17.807 --> 00:09:20.634
by a credentialed
professional who has completed

00:09:20.634 --> 00:09:23.298
an approved music therapy program.

00:09:23.298 --> 00:09:25.725
Sometimes when I tell people
I'm a music therapist,

00:09:25.725 --> 00:09:29.757
they say, music's so
therapeutic, and I totally agree,

00:09:29.757 --> 00:09:31.595
music is incredibly therapeutic.

00:09:31.595 --> 00:09:35.560
But a music therapist
has some extra skills

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:39.727
and knowledge base to really
use music in a therapeutic way

00:09:40.744 --> 00:09:44.911
to address non-musical goals,
non-musical behavioral goals.

00:09:47.886 --> 00:09:50.860
Some things that are not music therapy.

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:52.857
There is auditory integration therapy.

00:09:52.857 --> 00:09:56.379
And this was developed
in France in the '90s.

00:09:56.379 --> 00:09:58.108
And this now goes under different names,

00:09:58.108 --> 00:10:01.042
but essentially at the
core of it is taking music,

00:10:01.042 --> 00:10:04.266
especially modified music and
removing certain frequencies

00:10:04.266 --> 00:10:08.433
and children listen to
these for 30 minute sessions

00:10:10.289 --> 00:10:13.456
and there is actually a little machine

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:17.554
that would do this and the
United States actually banned

00:10:17.554 --> 00:10:20.571
this machine because it does, it's just,

00:10:20.571 --> 00:10:23.821
there's no evidence to support its use.

00:10:25.548 --> 00:10:27.049
Here's a quote from the American Speech

00:10:27.049 --> 00:10:29.016
Language Hearing Association,

00:10:29.016 --> 00:10:31.121
"Despite approximately
one decade of practice

00:10:31.121 --> 00:10:33.528
"in this country, this method has not met

00:10:33.528 --> 00:10:35.949
"scientific standards
for efficacy and safety

00:10:35.949 --> 00:10:38.178
"that would justify its inclusion

00:10:38.178 --> 00:10:40.844
"as mainstream treatment
for these disorders."

00:10:40.844 --> 00:10:44.173
So speech therapists are not ethically

00:10:44.173 --> 00:10:46.868
allowed to use this type of therapy.

00:10:46.868 --> 00:10:49.012
In addition, the American
Academy of Audiology,

00:10:49.012 --> 00:10:51.406
American Academy of Pediatrics,

00:10:51.406 --> 00:10:53.439
Educational Audiology Association,

00:10:53.439 --> 00:10:55.649
and the New York State
Department of Health

00:10:55.649 --> 00:10:58.856
also say that there's not enough evidence

00:10:58.856 --> 00:11:02.168
to show that this is effective.

00:11:02.168 --> 00:11:04.918
But a lot of people still use it.

00:11:06.816 --> 00:11:09.149
But it is not music therapy.

00:11:16.765 --> 00:11:20.651
So one music therapy
technique that's used,

00:11:20.651 --> 00:11:24.809
so Gabrielle Giffords,
she was a United States

00:11:24.809 --> 00:11:28.445
Representative from Arizona
who was tragically shot,

00:11:28.445 --> 00:11:31.445
and in order to get her speech back,

00:11:32.544 --> 00:11:34.322
she worked with a music therapist,

00:11:34.322 --> 00:11:36.611
and they used melodic intonation therapy.

00:11:36.611 --> 00:11:38.544
And melodic intonation therapy is used

00:11:38.544 --> 00:11:42.691
in the rehabilitation
of expressive aphasia.

00:11:42.691 --> 00:11:45.446
So and it's, melodic intonation therapy

00:11:45.446 --> 00:11:49.581
is a combination of some
physical cues like tapping,

00:11:49.581 --> 00:11:54.208
humming, singing, chanting,
and then eventually speaking.

00:11:54.208 --> 00:11:58.375
So music really helped her
to be able to speak again.

00:12:01.894 --> 00:12:03.691
So let's talk about music
therapy and working with

00:12:03.691 --> 00:12:07.687
individuals with
developmental disabilities,

00:12:07.687 --> 00:12:10.687
and my personal specialty is autism.

00:12:11.988 --> 00:12:15.714
So music therapy, there
are some goal areas.

00:12:15.714 --> 00:12:20.141
Social communication, so you
can teach language concepts,

00:12:20.141 --> 00:12:22.606
also emotional regulation.

00:12:22.606 --> 00:12:25.273
Some of the clients I work with,

00:12:27.687 --> 00:12:30.437
they're not always in a good mood

00:12:32.535 --> 00:12:35.676
and sometimes a lot of us are,

00:12:35.676 --> 00:12:39.431
we might need a certain
song to cheer us up,

00:12:39.431 --> 00:12:41.297
like we heard this morning.

00:12:41.297 --> 00:12:44.880
And music has an
incredible ability to just

00:12:46.639 --> 00:12:50.188
put us in a different emotional place.

00:12:50.188 --> 00:12:53.861
Also maybe if people are sad,
they listen to sad music.

00:12:53.861 --> 00:12:58.028
They really wanna fully feel
that emotional experience.

00:13:00.337 --> 00:13:03.420
So music has an incredible amount of,

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.097
music can be used in
so many different ways,

00:13:08.097 --> 00:13:10.846
you can use it to target
social communication,

00:13:10.846 --> 00:13:13.727
emotional regulation, also motor movement.

00:13:13.727 --> 00:13:16.488
You can use music to teach
various motor skills.

00:13:16.488 --> 00:13:19.468
We have some pre-academic
skills, academic skills,

00:13:19.468 --> 00:13:22.706
the ABC song, if the
ABC song wasn't around,

00:13:22.706 --> 00:13:24.830
we probably wouldn't
know the entire alphabet.

00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:27.944
(audience laughing)

00:13:27.944 --> 00:13:31.131
Numbers, colors, I'm
thinking of the Hokey Pokey,

00:13:31.131 --> 00:13:34.335
when there's music and movement
involved and you're saying

00:13:34.335 --> 00:13:38.002
what you're doing, it
resonates with people.

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:42.288
Some cognitive skills,
I'm just thinking about

00:13:42.288 --> 00:13:44.717
that 1-800-Kars4Kids, if that song

00:13:44.717 --> 00:13:47.203
wasn't part of that commercial,

00:13:47.203 --> 00:13:49.228
I would not know that phone number,

00:13:49.228 --> 00:13:53.395
but because of the jingle, we
all know that phone number.

00:13:54.473 --> 00:13:56.506
And there's also musical goals as well.

00:13:56.506 --> 00:13:58.828
So music instruction, music making,

00:13:58.828 --> 00:14:02.328
sharing that experience with other people.

00:14:04.931 --> 00:14:07.954
So music as an intrinsically
rewarding experience.

00:14:07.954 --> 00:14:09.788
Music is, for a lot of people,

00:14:09.788 --> 00:14:12.538
just it really gets them excited.

00:14:15.686 --> 00:14:18.113
Some of these kids, I just
bring out this big drum

00:14:18.113 --> 00:14:19.753
and they start playing on it and this,

00:14:19.753 --> 00:14:21.983
they are just so happy with it.

00:14:21.983 --> 00:14:24.827
And once I have their attention,
they're playing the drum,

00:14:24.827 --> 00:14:26.894
now it's a point of contact
and I can really connect

00:14:26.894 --> 00:14:28.767
with them and now I can bring in,

00:14:28.767 --> 00:14:30.911
maybe we can do Old MacDonald Had a Farm

00:14:30.911 --> 00:14:33.658
and bring in different
objects and start bringing

00:14:33.658 --> 00:14:35.516
some language concepts in there,

00:14:35.516 --> 00:14:36.979
and maybe start targeting some

00:14:36.979 --> 00:14:39.896
social communication goals as well.

00:14:41.318 --> 00:14:42.935
And going back to my African experience,

00:14:42.935 --> 00:14:45.802
that drum in the center
can be very powerful,

00:14:45.802 --> 00:14:49.543
it's kind of a visual,
it's almost a visual cue.

00:14:49.543 --> 00:14:51.488
They're just setting up the environment.

00:14:51.488 --> 00:14:54.155
And also in the Konkomba dances,

00:14:57.405 --> 00:14:58.938
people would move around the drum,

00:14:58.938 --> 00:15:00.880
I've also found that moving around a drum

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:05.047
can be very organizing for a
lot of kids that I work with.

00:15:10.174 --> 00:15:12.784
Enhanced perceptual functioning.

00:15:12.784 --> 00:15:14.990
When I was in college, I remember going to

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:18.905
the sculpture garden
and seeing this enormous

00:15:18.905 --> 00:15:21.619
sculpture of an eyeball, it was huge.

00:15:21.619 --> 00:15:24.249
And my friend said, if
your eyes were that big,

00:15:24.249 --> 00:15:26.086
would you see more?

00:15:26.086 --> 00:15:28.818
And I was like what does that even mean?

00:15:28.818 --> 00:15:30.505
Would you see more?

00:15:30.505 --> 00:15:34.123
But I think for a lot of children
with autism specifically,

00:15:34.123 --> 00:15:36.693
they are able to see
more and they hear more

00:15:36.693 --> 00:15:40.091
or maybe hear less or
only certain frequencies,

00:15:40.091 --> 00:15:44.258
or their sensory system is just
designed in a different way.

00:15:46.024 --> 00:15:50.903
So the next video I have here
is a young child with autism

00:15:50.903 --> 00:15:53.403
and it's, from my perspective,

00:15:54.753 --> 00:15:57.394
it really seems like he is hearing more.

00:15:57.394 --> 00:15:59.378
I have an instrument called a Vibra-Tone.

00:15:59.378 --> 00:16:03.159
So it's not, I dunno if,
just more of a noise maker,

00:16:03.159 --> 00:16:07.226
we're not really playing songs
based off of the Vibra-Tone,

00:16:07.226 --> 00:16:09.095
but sometimes I'll use that instrument

00:16:09.095 --> 00:16:12.428
to really capture the child's attention.

00:16:13.365 --> 00:16:15.084
And sometimes I'll play the Vibra-Tone

00:16:15.084 --> 00:16:18.404
and the mom might peek
in into the other room,

00:16:18.404 --> 00:16:20.247
she's like, what is that, that is so cool.

00:16:20.247 --> 00:16:23.215
Sometimes the parents are
more interested than the kids.

00:16:23.215 --> 00:16:27.048
But let me show you a
quick little video here.

00:16:32.015 --> 00:16:33.149
So it almost looks like we're not moving,

00:16:33.149 --> 00:16:34.086
but he is hitting that and he's

00:16:34.086 --> 00:16:35.805
listening to it very intensely.

00:16:35.805 --> 00:16:39.972
(Vibra-Tone clanking and resonating)

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.167
(Vibra-Tone clanking and resonating)

00:17:12.429 --> 00:17:16.596
(Vibra-Tone clanking and resonating)

00:17:18.114 --> 00:17:22.239
So just the sensory
experience of sound can be,

00:17:22.239 --> 00:17:26.406
it can really draw the attention
of a child into the moment.

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:29.992
And then from there, now
we're gonna add music on top

00:17:29.992 --> 00:17:33.897
of that so if they're already
very attuned to the sound,

00:17:33.897 --> 00:17:38.064
now music can be even more
of a motivating experience.

00:17:40.595 --> 00:17:43.147
And it could capture their
attention, joint attention

00:17:43.147 --> 00:17:47.160
is pivotal in language play
and social development.

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:49.536
Once again, that drum
being the point of contact

00:17:49.536 --> 00:17:52.326
where you relate with other people,

00:17:52.326 --> 00:17:55.764
maybe even non-verbally at first,

00:17:55.764 --> 00:18:00.190
then just through music,
musical expression.

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:03.180
In my practice I also use
lots of visual support,

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:05.411
lots of photographs, picture symbols,

00:18:05.411 --> 00:18:07.642
written words, which enhance the child's

00:18:07.642 --> 00:18:11.653
active participation and understanding.

00:18:11.653 --> 00:18:14.362
Pictures can be very powerful,
in the song Slippery Fish,

00:18:14.362 --> 00:18:18.875
you have Slippery Fish swimming
through the water there

00:18:18.875 --> 00:18:23.042
and gets eaten by a tuna fish,
and in between all of these,

00:18:24.878 --> 00:18:28.515
the song goes on and it
stops and you put your hands

00:18:28.515 --> 00:18:31.054
up to your mouth and say
oh no, it's been eaten by,

00:18:31.054 --> 00:18:34.961
there's a tuna fish, there's a shark,

00:18:34.961 --> 00:18:36.469
so there's multiple opportunities

00:18:36.469 --> 00:18:39.302
to practice this and use gestures.

00:18:41.509 --> 00:18:45.271
And once the child, once
they become familiar

00:18:45.271 --> 00:18:47.773
with the patterning of the song,

00:18:47.773 --> 00:18:52.269
they're more likely to do that
gesture, it becomes familiar,

00:18:52.269 --> 00:18:55.184
they're saying I know how this song works

00:18:55.184 --> 00:18:57.564
and now is the moment
I'm supposed to do this,

00:18:57.564 --> 00:19:00.656
especially I can, I might
withhold one of the pictures.

00:19:00.656 --> 00:19:04.133
So we'll get to the shark and
maybe we'll get to the octopus

00:19:04.133 --> 00:19:07.466
and we'll stop, and now the child knows,

00:19:08.363 --> 00:19:09.801
oh no, soon as he says oh no,

00:19:09.801 --> 00:19:13.507
then the song can continue once again.

00:19:13.507 --> 00:19:15.757
There's the enormous whale.

00:19:21.893 --> 00:19:24.716
There was an old lady who swallowed flies.

00:19:24.716 --> 00:19:26.463
Kids love this one.

00:19:26.463 --> 00:19:30.186
There's the fly, I'm
not sure of all you guys

00:19:30.186 --> 00:19:32.552
remember this song but we have
the lady swallowed the fly

00:19:32.552 --> 00:19:34.735
and then she swallowed the
spider and then the bird

00:19:34.735 --> 00:19:37.438
and the cat and dog and the goat, cow,

00:19:37.438 --> 00:19:38.696
all the way over to the horse,

00:19:38.696 --> 00:19:42.876
at which point the old
lady falls over and dies.

00:19:42.876 --> 00:19:45.175
(audience laughing)

00:19:45.175 --> 00:19:48.037
Remember one time I had a father,

00:19:48.037 --> 00:19:52.316
did the song with the child,
you know kids, they don't,

00:19:52.316 --> 00:19:54.983
from my perspective, it
doesn't really seem like

00:19:54.983 --> 00:19:56.794
they're understanding what dying means,

00:19:56.794 --> 00:19:58.005
it's just kind of a funny thing

00:19:58.005 --> 00:20:00.672
and the old lady magically
comes back to life.

00:20:00.672 --> 00:20:02.378
I remember a father one
time leaning in like,

00:20:02.378 --> 00:20:03.714
what are you teaching my child?

00:20:03.714 --> 00:20:06.488
(audience laughing)

00:20:06.488 --> 00:20:07.889
Sometimes, I think adults,

00:20:07.889 --> 00:20:11.056
we tend to overthink lyrics and songs.

00:20:15.341 --> 00:20:17.754
Music can be used as a reinforcers.

00:20:17.754 --> 00:20:21.761
I have Thomas the Tank Engine,
the theme song, on my iPhone,

00:20:21.761 --> 00:20:23.061
and if I'm working with a child

00:20:23.061 --> 00:20:24.919
and it's a really challenging child,

00:20:24.919 --> 00:20:28.157
he's not really focused on
anything, that's my go-to.

00:20:28.157 --> 00:20:30.390
I play Thomas the Tank Engine
and just all of a sudden

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:33.890
he freezes like, what, you know something,

00:20:34.871 --> 00:20:36.719
where is that music coming from?

00:20:36.719 --> 00:20:39.366
And then I'll stop it, and
maybe we'll sit in the chair,

00:20:39.366 --> 00:20:42.636
and now he might be more
apt, I'll stop the song,

00:20:42.636 --> 00:20:45.974
as soon as he does what I want him to do,

00:20:45.974 --> 00:20:49.029
then the music continues, I
can use music as a reinforcer

00:20:49.029 --> 00:20:51.696
to guide and shape his behavior.

00:20:54.682 --> 00:20:57.654
So in addition to being a music therapist,

00:20:57.654 --> 00:21:02.222
I'm also a behavior analyst,
but I refer to myself

00:21:02.222 --> 00:21:05.465
as a developmental behaviorist.

00:21:05.465 --> 00:21:08.882
ABA's powerful but I think sometimes that

00:21:10.843 --> 00:21:14.084
it's easy to overlook the developmental

00:21:14.084 --> 00:21:16.584
aspect of children growing up.

00:21:20.835 --> 00:21:23.207
What's great about
music, it's an experience

00:21:23.207 --> 00:21:25.662
that's just very natural and
can happen in the moment,

00:21:25.662 --> 00:21:28.119
so it's not so much a
checklist kind of thing

00:21:28.119 --> 00:21:30.399
where I'm just taking data constantly,

00:21:30.399 --> 00:21:32.857
but I can use the principles of ABA

00:21:32.857 --> 00:21:36.601
in a more natural way, and in a fun way.

00:21:36.601 --> 00:21:38.991
So ABA's based on BF
Skinner's operant conditioning

00:21:38.991 --> 00:21:43.687
with our antecedent, our
behavior, and our consequence.

00:21:43.687 --> 00:21:47.809
So in this situation, I'm
using music as a consequence.

00:21:47.809 --> 00:21:50.549
The Farmer in the Dell
was one of the first

00:21:50.549 --> 00:21:54.632
musical interventions I
created at my internship,

00:21:55.537 --> 00:21:58.704
actually at UCSF in the autism clinic.

00:22:01.172 --> 00:22:03.438
I apologize for the song,
I have heard this song

00:22:03.438 --> 00:22:06.098
thousands of times, children love this.

00:22:06.098 --> 00:22:07.772
So essentially, I'll play the song,

00:22:07.772 --> 00:22:11.733
and then each of these pieces
are little felt pieces.

00:22:11.733 --> 00:22:15.307
And then I'll lay out
farmer, the wife, the child,

00:22:15.307 --> 00:22:17.612
the nurse, and go all the
way down and repeat it

00:22:17.612 --> 00:22:19.661
a couple times so the child sees

00:22:19.661 --> 00:22:22.762
what's going on and the
music really draws them in.

00:22:22.762 --> 00:22:24.398
Here, let me play the song here.

00:22:24.398 --> 00:22:27.873
("Farmer in the Dell")

00:22:27.873 --> 00:22:31.834
♫ The farmer in the dell,
the farmer in the dell

00:22:31.834 --> 00:22:36.244
♫ Hi ho the derry-o,
the farmer in the dell

00:22:36.244 --> 00:22:39.092
♫ The farmer takes a wife,
the farmer takes a wife

00:22:39.092 --> 00:22:41.267
- And once again, just the song repeats

00:22:41.267 --> 00:22:44.767
over and over and over again, it's a very,

00:22:46.238 --> 00:22:48.840
it's the same song every time,
so it's something familiar

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:51.321
that the child can really latch onto.

00:22:51.321 --> 00:22:54.301
And what's amazing about
this simple song is that

00:22:54.301 --> 00:22:57.573
I can lay out all these
pieces, teaching sequencing,

00:22:57.573 --> 00:23:01.240
and then I might hide,
I might hide the dog,

00:23:03.202 --> 00:23:04.841
or maybe place it across the room

00:23:04.841 --> 00:23:06.139
and for a child with autism,

00:23:06.139 --> 00:23:10.690
they might have a hard time
following my line of vision.

00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:14.857
But if they're motivated by
this and they want the pattern,

00:23:16.459 --> 00:23:20.290
a lot of the children with
autism has this need to complete.

00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:23.343
So if the song stops in the middle,

00:23:23.343 --> 00:23:24.736
they're gonna want to try to do

00:23:24.736 --> 00:23:28.403
whatever it takes to
make the song continue.

00:23:29.317 --> 00:23:33.332
So I might hide the dog in a
certain corner of the room,

00:23:33.332 --> 00:23:35.766
and where is the dog?

00:23:35.766 --> 00:23:37.541
Teach the language, where is the dog?

00:23:37.541 --> 00:23:39.903
Oh, it's over there,
maybe (speaking quickly),

00:23:39.903 --> 00:23:42.394
and I point to it, maybe it's nearby,

00:23:42.394 --> 00:23:44.555
then I further point it, further away,

00:23:44.555 --> 00:23:48.638
or maybe I just use my
eyes and kind of use this,

00:23:50.213 --> 00:23:51.991
target some of these social communication

00:23:51.991 --> 00:23:54.658
goals in the middle of the song.

00:23:55.625 --> 00:23:59.152
Once again, kids are so inspirational.

00:23:59.152 --> 00:24:01.275
At the end of the song,
the cheese stands alone,

00:24:01.275 --> 00:24:05.128
I always ask the kid, why
does the cheese stand alone?

00:24:05.128 --> 00:24:07.593
And this one kid says, 'cause it's food.

00:24:07.593 --> 00:24:09.091
I'm like, oh right, he's like yeah,

00:24:09.091 --> 00:24:11.986
the people and animals
and the food is different,

00:24:11.986 --> 00:24:14.706
so it's food, the cheese stands alone.

00:24:14.706 --> 00:24:17.706
(audience laughing)

00:24:20.643 --> 00:24:22.226
Another thing that I do
with this Farmer in the Dell

00:24:22.226 --> 00:24:24.944
is I might hold one of
the pieces in my hands.

00:24:24.944 --> 00:24:25.942
What is it?

00:24:25.942 --> 00:24:28.181
Maybe have the child
guess, it has four legs,

00:24:28.181 --> 00:24:30.848
and it says meow, is it the cat?

00:24:33.507 --> 00:24:36.765
Really modeling the language,
teaching the language,

00:24:36.765 --> 00:24:38.953
and then generalizing the language

00:24:38.953 --> 00:24:41.746
to other real life experiences outside of

00:24:41.746 --> 00:24:44.579
the Farmer in the Dell experience.

00:24:48.275 --> 00:24:51.108
And rhythm used as a temporal cue.

00:24:53.476 --> 00:24:55.761
So rhythm and timing are
important in motor learning.

00:24:55.761 --> 00:24:58.950
The video, I believe I'm gonna show next,

00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:01.450
is a child with cerebral palsy

00:25:02.396 --> 00:25:04.813
and we go back to the idea of

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:08.120
sometimes if someone's
blind, they can hear better,

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:10.617
or some of the kids that I work with

00:25:10.617 --> 00:25:12.166
and the individuals I work with,

00:25:12.166 --> 00:25:14.560
they might have particular disabilities,

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:16.324
but they have incredible strengths,

00:25:16.324 --> 00:25:19.557
I have one child who's
an incredible savant.

00:25:19.557 --> 00:25:23.253
He has a hard time putting
one Velcro strap on his shoe

00:25:23.253 --> 00:25:26.924
but can play anything on the
piano in any key that he wants,

00:25:26.924 --> 00:25:29.518
forwards and backwards, he's
never been taught any of this.

00:25:29.518 --> 00:25:32.394
He can do this baroque bass
pattern in his left hand,

00:25:32.394 --> 00:25:34.394
just completely amazing.

00:25:35.804 --> 00:25:39.971
But coming back to this,
the rhythm can really drive

00:25:42.029 --> 00:25:45.103
different patterns of motor learning

00:25:45.103 --> 00:25:49.291
and really drive the ability to maybe just

00:25:49.291 --> 00:25:52.874
use your fingers or
maybe in gait training.

00:25:54.846 --> 00:25:57.907
So here's a video, and I'm just
using a really simple rhythm

00:25:57.907 --> 00:26:00.287
at the keyboard and initially
it's really challenging

00:26:00.287 --> 00:26:05.278
for him to move his fingers
in a synchronized way,

00:26:05.278 --> 00:26:08.850
in a patterned way, but over time,

00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:11.918
he's able to, he was able to do this.

00:26:11.918 --> 00:26:15.489
This child also had perfect
pitch, it was pretty amazing.

00:26:15.489 --> 00:26:17.700
I would play a chord, he
would be able to identify

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:21.104
each note in that chord, all
three notes in the chord.

00:26:21.104 --> 00:26:23.283
If I played a seventh
chord, added a fourth note,

00:26:23.283 --> 00:26:24.598
he's like wait, something's different,

00:26:24.598 --> 00:26:25.431
'cause you're playing,

00:26:25.431 --> 00:26:27.586
and he would let me know
what note I was playing.

00:26:27.586 --> 00:26:31.116
So he'd be able to hear
four notes simultaneously.

00:26:31.116 --> 00:26:32.783
It's pretty amazing.

00:26:34.501 --> 00:26:36.526
(upbeat synthesized music)

00:26:36.526 --> 00:26:39.609
(gentle piano music)

00:26:48.531 --> 00:26:51.091
So once again, the rhythm is providing

00:26:51.091 --> 00:26:54.994
a temporal cue to drive
the motor movements,

00:26:54.994 --> 00:26:58.244
and the music being motivating for him.

00:27:00.481 --> 00:27:01.975
The rhythm and music can also

00:27:01.975 --> 00:27:04.459
be used in gait rehabilitation.

00:27:04.459 --> 00:27:07.958
When I went to grad school,
Dr. Tau does a lot of work

00:27:07.958 --> 00:27:10.612
on this with Parkinson's patients,

00:27:10.612 --> 00:27:12.769
and they've shown that music and rhythm

00:27:12.769 --> 00:27:14.990
can improve step cadence, stride length,

00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:17.997
symmetry, and velocity over time,

00:27:17.997 --> 00:27:21.633
so essentially someone might
have a hard time walking

00:27:21.633 --> 00:27:24.293
in a coordinated way
and you start listening

00:27:24.293 --> 00:27:26.223
to New York, New York and
the next thing you know,

00:27:26.223 --> 00:27:29.243
you start where they're at,

00:27:29.243 --> 00:27:31.027
you use the song New York, New York,

00:27:31.027 --> 00:27:33.990
and they start in a place that matches

00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:36.707
their current movement and
slowly increase the tempo

00:27:36.707 --> 00:27:40.874
to the point where their
gait is improved remarkably.

00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:47.502
Impelling and anticipatory nature

00:27:47.502 --> 00:27:49.669
of rhythm promotes speech.

00:27:55.675 --> 00:27:59.760
And music facilitates
non-propositional speech.

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.608
When I'm working, I was
just working with a child

00:28:01.608 --> 00:28:03.290
a couple days ago and I was using

00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:07.195
Old MacDonald Had a Farm and you know,

00:28:07.195 --> 00:28:08.481
♫ Old MacDonald had a farm

00:28:08.481 --> 00:28:12.020
All of a sudden, here's a child
who doesn't really speak and

00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:13.080
♫ E-I-E-I-O

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:16.610
He knows that pattern, just the
rhythm and the music almost,

00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:19.668
he must have had that,
just that need to complete,

00:28:19.668 --> 00:28:22.691
he wants to fill in the gaps there.

00:28:22.691 --> 00:28:25.087
It's the patterning of
music that really helps us

00:28:25.087 --> 00:28:28.920
to chunk that information
to make sense of it.

00:28:29.872 --> 00:28:32.537
Structure and patterning in
music can direct attention

00:28:32.537 --> 00:28:36.287
toward language concepts
and social behavior.

00:28:37.845 --> 00:28:39.012
This was this,

00:28:43.568 --> 00:28:45.284
the same child that I was working with.

00:28:45.284 --> 00:28:47.624
Once again, I had about two
sessions, pretty challenging,

00:28:47.624 --> 00:28:50.709
not much vocal participation on his part.

00:28:50.709 --> 00:28:54.042
And then I busted out Bingo, great song,

00:28:56.256 --> 00:28:58.172
it's amazing how some of these songs

00:28:58.172 --> 00:29:01.556
just really motivate kids,
so I start playing Bingo

00:29:01.556 --> 00:29:04.850
and all of a sudden he
starts beating the drum,

00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:07.708
the B-I-N-G-O, he got that,

00:29:07.708 --> 00:29:09.403
and started verbally participating,

00:29:09.403 --> 00:29:11.885
put the drum in front
of him, encouraged him,

00:29:11.885 --> 00:29:14.157
next thing I know I tried
the Old MacDonald Had a Farm,

00:29:14.157 --> 00:29:16.353
he starts singing that,
he started sharing,

00:29:16.353 --> 00:29:20.059
we started singing just different songs,

00:29:20.059 --> 00:29:22.917
the lyrics back and forth,
he was filling in the gaps.

00:29:22.917 --> 00:29:24.089
And the next thing you know,

00:29:24.089 --> 00:29:26.932
we're talking about
the window in my office

00:29:26.932 --> 00:29:29.383
and that's a big window,
yeah, the smaller window.

00:29:29.383 --> 00:29:33.550
So the music was really,
was the spark that created,

00:29:36.526 --> 00:29:39.473
that helped to create this
conversation back and forth.

00:29:39.473 --> 00:29:41.640
I met him where he was at,

00:29:42.826 --> 00:29:45.639
possibly his world is fairly chaotic,

00:29:45.639 --> 00:29:49.443
so music really brought some order to it.

00:29:49.443 --> 00:29:54.099
And using a simple song like
Bingo just really made sense

00:29:54.099 --> 00:29:57.737
to him and was something that he could,

00:29:57.737 --> 00:29:59.712
something that we could share together,

00:29:59.712 --> 00:30:03.379
and that encouraged his
vocal participation.

00:30:07.362 --> 00:30:11.013
Simon Baron-Cohen talks
about individuals with autism

00:30:11.013 --> 00:30:13.510
and they prefer patterned
or rule-oriented structures

00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:15.060
and have difficulties with systems

00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:18.143
that require a high degree of change.

00:30:20.347 --> 00:30:22.920
And that's what music is,
is just repeating pattern,

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:25.048
Old MacDonald Had a Farm, Bingo,

00:30:25.048 --> 00:30:28.411
The Farmer in the Dell,
these songs, they just cycle,

00:30:28.411 --> 00:30:30.826
The Wheels on the Bus Go Round and Round.

00:30:30.826 --> 00:30:33.394
It's just amazing how many
children know that song

00:30:33.394 --> 00:30:35.909
and it's just the same song
that repeats over and over.

00:30:35.909 --> 00:30:38.632
You can change the words and
sing in 20 different ways

00:30:38.632 --> 00:30:41.836
and children will remain
engaged in that song

00:30:41.836 --> 00:30:44.716
because that's something
that they're drawn toward

00:30:44.716 --> 00:30:48.133
and something that they're familiar with.

00:30:49.644 --> 00:30:52.363
Here's another example,
This Old Man using props,

00:30:52.363 --> 00:30:55.029
teaching numbers, once
again I could maybe hide

00:30:55.029 --> 00:30:58.282
some of these pieces, have it nearby,

00:30:58.282 --> 00:30:59.944
teaching some pointing gestures

00:30:59.944 --> 00:31:02.823
or maybe have the child
follow my line of vision

00:31:02.823 --> 00:31:05.590
to some of these objects
and I could stop the song

00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:08.667
in the middle and just
really draw the attention

00:31:08.667 --> 00:31:11.511
to maybe a specific language concepts,

00:31:11.511 --> 00:31:13.762
and then continue the song.

00:31:13.762 --> 00:31:16.364
And then maybe this old man
might have a conversation,

00:31:16.364 --> 00:31:19.447
or he might feel sad about something.

00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:24.588
Yeah, these props are
incredible, and This Old Man,

00:31:24.588 --> 00:31:27.162
it's a pretty long song,
it's 10 verses in the song.

00:31:27.162 --> 00:31:29.356
And once again, it just
repeats over and over again.

00:31:29.356 --> 00:31:31.911
Sometimes when I reach 10,
kids are like, why only 10?

00:31:31.911 --> 00:31:32.918
Let's keep on going.

00:31:32.918 --> 00:31:35.918
(audience laughing)

00:31:39.068 --> 00:31:41.719
The rapid temporal processing hypothesis.

00:31:41.719 --> 00:31:45.482
I'm going a little bit,
so once again, my focus,

00:31:45.482 --> 00:31:49.649
my personal focus is working
with children with autism.

00:31:50.676 --> 00:31:54.718
And let's see, the rapid
temporal processing hypothesis

00:31:54.718 --> 00:31:58.625
says speech perception relies
on higher temporal resolution

00:31:58.625 --> 00:32:02.110
of complex stimuli, making
the deficit in autism

00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:05.461
a timing problem where
slower, repetitive sounds,

00:32:05.461 --> 00:32:07.878
like in music, remain intact.

00:32:11.883 --> 00:32:14.757
And it goes back, here's a talking drum,

00:32:14.757 --> 00:32:19.712
this is someone from Kidjaboun
playing a talking drum.

00:32:19.712 --> 00:32:22.878
Now with this drum, they're
actually able to talk with it.

00:32:22.878 --> 00:32:26.295
So they, since these languages are tonal,

00:32:27.669 --> 00:32:29.790
they're able to say things on the drum,

00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:32.071
they could say my name,
they could say different

00:32:32.071 --> 00:32:34.517
things about me, so there
might be a talking drum player

00:32:34.517 --> 00:32:37.224
in the marketplace with his talking drum

00:32:37.224 --> 00:32:40.212
and he would be able to
sing praises to someone

00:32:40.212 --> 00:32:41.994
sitting by him or maybe insult someone

00:32:41.994 --> 00:32:43.433
sitting a little bit further away

00:32:43.433 --> 00:32:46.616
and people literally
understand what he's saying.

00:32:46.616 --> 00:32:47.948
So once again, making that connection

00:32:47.948 --> 00:32:49.948
with language and music.

00:32:51.423 --> 00:32:55.590
Both music and speech use
pitch, timing, and timbre.

00:32:57.791 --> 00:33:00.761
And they've actually done
some research that shows that

00:33:00.761 --> 00:33:02.112
training on a musical instrument

00:33:02.112 --> 00:33:04.865
changes subcortical
encoding of speech patterns

00:33:04.865 --> 00:33:08.698
and can improve how
speech and noise is heard.

00:33:11.814 --> 00:33:13.433
Music and language share underlying

00:33:13.433 --> 00:33:15.862
cognitive and neural mechanisms.

00:33:15.862 --> 00:33:17.464
Auditory processing
structures in the brain

00:33:17.464 --> 00:33:21.547
respond in similar ways
to both speech and music.

00:33:22.482 --> 00:33:24.338
So there's a lot of overlap between,

00:33:24.338 --> 00:33:26.859
there's a lot of overlap
in the way that speech

00:33:26.859 --> 00:33:31.026
and music is processed in
the brain and perceived.

00:33:32.619 --> 00:33:34.831
Some language, we have
words as discrete elements

00:33:34.831 --> 00:33:37.586
and they're combined to form sentences.

00:33:37.586 --> 00:33:40.522
In music, we have individual
and simultaneous tones

00:33:40.522 --> 00:33:42.173
in the form of intervals and chords

00:33:42.173 --> 00:33:46.256
which combine to form
meaningful musical phrases.

00:33:48.490 --> 00:33:50.705
Here's some additional
similarities in music and language,

00:33:50.705 --> 00:33:53.386
we've got phonemes, basic sound units,

00:33:53.386 --> 00:33:56.553
syntax, how sound units are organized,

00:33:57.652 --> 00:34:01.447
semantics, meaning that is
assigned to sound sequences,

00:34:01.447 --> 00:34:03.339
and pragmatics, rules that define

00:34:03.339 --> 00:34:06.422
effective communicative interactions.

00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:12.443
So my particular interest was in syntax.

00:34:14.293 --> 00:34:16.578
Syntax is a set of principles that governs

00:34:16.578 --> 00:34:18.394
the combination of discrete elements

00:34:18.394 --> 00:34:21.305
into meaningful and structural sequences.

00:34:21.305 --> 00:34:22.484
It's cognitive processing

00:34:22.484 --> 00:34:25.734
of structural relations between events.

00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:30.307
A little story, story, there was a study,

00:34:30.307 --> 00:34:32.807
Ami Klin back in 1992 and '92,

00:34:33.705 --> 00:34:34.935
and essentially what they did,

00:34:34.935 --> 00:34:37.149
what he did, he had a teddy bear.

00:34:37.149 --> 00:34:39.239
And on this teddy bear
had a couple buttons.

00:34:39.239 --> 00:34:43.159
When a child pushed one of the buttons,

00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:44.967
he would be able to hear the voice

00:34:44.967 --> 00:34:46.819
of his mother reading a story.

00:34:46.819 --> 00:34:48.243
When a child pushed the other button,

00:34:48.243 --> 00:34:52.413
he would hear a bunch of
random sounds in a bar,

00:34:52.413 --> 00:34:56.629
just like random noise,
you can't really hear

00:34:56.629 --> 00:35:00.629
one particular voice but
just a crowd situation,

00:35:03.179 --> 00:35:05.370
the noise of a crowd.

00:35:05.370 --> 00:35:08.036
And what they found was,
children with autism

00:35:08.036 --> 00:35:12.036
either didn't show any,
didn't show a preference

00:35:12.912 --> 00:35:15.722
for either or they showed a preference

00:35:15.722 --> 00:35:19.332
for the noise of the crowd,
whereas typically developing

00:35:19.332 --> 00:35:21.658
children and children with
intellectual disability

00:35:21.658 --> 00:35:23.607
preferred their mother's voice.

00:35:23.607 --> 00:35:26.751
So I was wondering why is that happening?

00:35:26.751 --> 00:35:28.229
And I was thinking perhaps there might

00:35:28.229 --> 00:35:31.562
be deficits in the syntactic processing.

00:35:36.167 --> 00:35:39.917
Now culture influences
syntactic development.

00:35:41.202 --> 00:35:43.535
So people have a preference,

00:35:44.526 --> 00:35:46.902
someone raised in a particular culture

00:35:46.902 --> 00:35:49.081
will have a preference for
the music from that culture

00:35:49.081 --> 00:35:52.581
as well as the language from that culture.

00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:59.483
So I thought that if
I took an African song

00:35:59.483 --> 00:36:02.983
that was similar, it was similar in tempo,

00:36:05.406 --> 00:36:08.659
orchestration, and form, to
an American children's song

00:36:08.659 --> 00:36:12.826
that a child with autism
should not show a preference

00:36:13.679 --> 00:36:16.058
for either of those types of music.

00:36:16.058 --> 00:36:17.767
If their syntactic development is,

00:36:17.767 --> 00:36:21.183
if there's deficits in their language,

00:36:21.183 --> 00:36:23.594
then the same should be true for music

00:36:23.594 --> 00:36:26.256
since there's a lot of overlap
between those two regions,

00:36:26.256 --> 00:36:28.756
between those, let's see here.

00:36:32.593 --> 00:36:36.426
But I didn't find that,
which is good and bad.

00:36:39.905 --> 00:36:44.521
It was puzzling because I
was thinking if a child with

00:36:44.521 --> 00:36:48.688
autism doesn't show a preference
for his native language

00:36:50.622 --> 00:36:52.566
then why does he show a preference

00:36:52.566 --> 00:36:55.066
for American children's music?

00:36:57.611 --> 00:37:00.113
And as you can see in the
graph, the children with autism,

00:37:00.113 --> 00:37:04.820
in typically developing,
it's almost identical.

00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:06.736
Children with intellectual
disability showed

00:37:06.736 --> 00:37:09.921
a stronger preference for
American children's music.

00:37:09.921 --> 00:37:13.160
The song that I used was The
Green Grass Grew All Around,

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:15.918
essentially I had two
buttons, you push one button,

00:37:15.918 --> 00:37:18.760
and they would get 10
seconds of one type of music

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:22.361
and the music would stop
and they would choose

00:37:22.361 --> 00:37:24.805
the same button or the other button.

00:37:24.805 --> 00:37:27.543
And then I would change the location

00:37:27.543 --> 00:37:30.353
of the buttons during the study.

00:37:30.353 --> 00:37:33.603
And there's six children in each group.

00:37:35.966 --> 00:37:39.511
And then I came across
the shared syntactic

00:37:39.511 --> 00:37:43.678
integration resource hypothesis,
which made sense to me.

00:37:47.667 --> 00:37:51.659
So essentially what this says
is that syntax is processed

00:37:51.659 --> 00:37:55.490
in a shared system in the
frontal part of the brain.

00:37:55.490 --> 00:37:59.364
But, then it splits off
to musical representations

00:37:59.364 --> 00:38:02.329
and linguistic representations,
which are separate.

00:38:02.329 --> 00:38:06.496
So someone might be able
to process syntax in music,

00:38:09.161 --> 00:38:11.078
but not process, sorry,

00:38:11.950 --> 00:38:15.533
so if a child is not
attending to language,

00:38:18.910 --> 00:38:21.174
then they're not gonna make,
they're not gonna build up

00:38:21.174 --> 00:38:23.020
that knowledge base of language.

00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:26.038
But music is on a separate track,

00:38:26.038 --> 00:38:28.643
so that might not be effective.

00:38:28.643 --> 00:38:32.298
So a child with autism who
doesn't pick up on the syntax

00:38:32.298 --> 00:38:36.465
in language, they might pick
up on the syntax in music.

00:38:40.721 --> 00:38:43.303
And there's actually recent research

00:38:43.303 --> 00:38:46.803
showing that the processing
of music and linguistic syntax

00:38:46.803 --> 00:38:50.636
interact in Broca's area,
in that shared area.

00:38:54.773 --> 00:38:56.038
Syntactic deficits in the study

00:38:56.038 --> 00:38:58.140
appeared to be domain-specific,

00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:00.733
implicating linguistic
syntactic representations

00:39:00.733 --> 00:39:03.758
rather than shared syntactic processes.

00:39:03.758 --> 00:39:07.925
So the issue here isn't the
syntactic processing of syntax,

00:39:10.249 --> 00:39:11.608
'cause that seems to be intact,

00:39:11.608 --> 00:39:15.621
because the children are
processing musical syntax,

00:39:15.621 --> 00:39:18.752
but not processing the linguistic syntax.

00:39:18.752 --> 00:39:21.076
So they're storing that
musical information

00:39:21.076 --> 00:39:24.659
but not storing the
linguistic information.

00:39:26.097 --> 00:39:27.914
So music's a language that a lot

00:39:27.914 --> 00:39:30.831
of children with autism understand.

00:39:37.291 --> 00:39:39.882
And a couple other things here,
music as a mnemonic device,

00:39:39.882 --> 00:39:43.048
and I talked about that
1-800-Kars4Kids commercial,

00:39:43.048 --> 00:39:44.465
and the ABC song.

00:39:46.558 --> 00:39:49.009
Listening to music recruits attention

00:39:49.009 --> 00:39:50.571
and working memory circuits,

00:39:50.571 --> 00:39:53.628
and music training improves verbal memory.

00:39:53.628 --> 00:39:57.740
Verbal learning with a
musical template increases

00:39:57.740 --> 00:40:00.907
neuronal synchronization and approves,

00:40:01.945 --> 00:40:06.112
improves, I should have
said, improves verbal memory.

00:40:07.458 --> 00:40:10.780
So once again, music is a
way to chunk information

00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:14.947
to make it more accessible,
to learn and to remember.

00:40:18.278 --> 00:40:21.142
Also music can be used as
symbolic communication.

00:40:21.142 --> 00:40:23.066
For some of these
children that I work with,

00:40:23.066 --> 00:40:25.047
they have a hard time with conversation,

00:40:25.047 --> 00:40:27.224
the back and forth exchange of ideas.

00:40:27.224 --> 00:40:30.589
So I might designate one
instrument, let's say a drum,

00:40:30.589 --> 00:40:32.857
that'll be the narration instrument,

00:40:32.857 --> 00:40:35.305
the making comments instrument.

00:40:35.305 --> 00:40:38.528
Or I might, and then I
might include a xylophone,

00:40:38.528 --> 00:40:40.272
and that's the question instrument.

00:40:40.272 --> 00:40:44.521
So initially we'll have
a nonverbal conversation,

00:40:44.521 --> 00:40:48.172
a musical conversation,
so I'll play on the drum

00:40:48.172 --> 00:40:51.700
a little bit and then maybe
ask a couple questions.

00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:52.977
And we'll go back and forth like that,

00:40:52.977 --> 00:40:55.063
very motivating for the child,

00:40:55.063 --> 00:40:57.977
and that talk about what that meant.

00:40:57.977 --> 00:40:59.378
How many comments did we make?

00:40:59.378 --> 00:41:01.328
How many questions did we ask?

00:41:01.328 --> 00:41:04.243
Are we asking enough questions?

00:41:04.243 --> 00:41:08.410
So initially we're just using
music as a way to communicate

00:41:09.784 --> 00:41:12.613
and then we can add
some processing to that.

00:41:12.613 --> 00:41:15.291
Take away the music and then work on

00:41:15.291 --> 00:41:16.948
just having a conversation,

00:41:16.948 --> 00:41:20.865
so music is being used
as a way to help a child

00:41:23.788 --> 00:41:27.871
understand that back and
forth exchange of ideas.

00:41:29.707 --> 00:41:32.874
And also music as a social experience.

00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:38.675
My personal frustration with being

00:41:38.675 --> 00:41:41.342
a behavior analyst is I've seen,

00:41:44.455 --> 00:41:46.146
it's sometimes the case where

00:41:46.146 --> 00:41:49.041
it's more of a top down
kind of thing in ABA,

00:41:49.041 --> 00:41:51.415
I'm gonna ask you a question,
you're gonna respond.

00:41:51.415 --> 00:41:53.288
I'm gonna ask you a question,
you're gonna respond,

00:41:53.288 --> 00:41:55.625
I have a whole list of all these questions

00:41:55.625 --> 00:41:57.777
we have to get through
before the session's over.

00:41:57.777 --> 00:42:01.777
But from my experience,
and I've discovered that

00:42:02.925 --> 00:42:04.544
if there's always just questions,

00:42:04.544 --> 00:42:06.502
always a probing question's happening,

00:42:06.502 --> 00:42:09.784
it takes away the inspiration of some of

00:42:09.784 --> 00:42:12.784
these kids to initiate on their own.

00:42:14.856 --> 00:42:17.514
So communication's a two way street.

00:42:17.514 --> 00:42:20.270
If it was always people
need you to respond

00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:23.834
to questions all the
time, maybe it shuts down

00:42:23.834 --> 00:42:27.197
the ability to have that
back and forth exchange.

00:42:27.197 --> 00:42:29.848
And what's great about music
is that music allows us

00:42:29.848 --> 00:42:33.931
to have that back and
forth emotional experience.

00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:39.743
And this last video I wanna
show you is of a child,

00:42:39.743 --> 00:42:42.644
and I was wearing my ABA
hat and I was working

00:42:42.644 --> 00:42:44.533
on something very specific before.

00:42:44.533 --> 00:42:48.728
As I was putting away the
drum, this child with autism

00:42:48.728 --> 00:42:52.991
loves playing this drum, he
could probably do it all day.

00:42:52.991 --> 00:42:55.634
So he started playing it,
and then I started using that

00:42:55.634 --> 00:42:58.967
as an opportunity to go with the moment,

00:43:00.057 --> 00:43:02.332
just really enjoy that back and forth

00:43:02.332 --> 00:43:04.499
exchange of musical ideas.

00:43:06.533 --> 00:43:09.824
And then I was also started to
play some eye contact games,

00:43:09.824 --> 00:43:12.203
so I was hiding behind the
drum, have him follow my eye,

00:43:12.203 --> 00:43:15.008
moving to different sides of
the drum, behind the drum.

00:43:15.008 --> 00:43:18.663
And then I was able to
use the rhythm of the drum

00:43:18.663 --> 00:43:21.628
to really accent some language concepts.

00:43:21.628 --> 00:43:25.545
I think initially he
says, that's a great song.

00:43:27.282 --> 00:43:31.355
So I tried to, I'm like
yeah, it is a great song,

00:43:31.355 --> 00:43:34.431
but this is fun, and I
think there's a point

00:43:34.431 --> 00:43:36.105
where he says that is
fun, I try to correct him

00:43:36.105 --> 00:43:38.931
to say this is fun and I'm
playing on the drum like,

00:43:38.931 --> 00:43:40.922
(tapping)
this is fun.

00:43:40.922 --> 00:43:42.162
And then he does it back and forth,

00:43:42.162 --> 00:43:45.059
we play some more music, and
then I bring back that idea,

00:43:45.059 --> 00:43:47.774
this is fun, driving home
that language concepts,

00:43:47.774 --> 00:43:51.774
driving home that language,
or just that phrase,

00:43:53.104 --> 00:43:55.912
just teaching him that
phrase in that moment.

00:43:55.912 --> 00:43:57.649
And so it's something meaningful to him

00:43:57.649 --> 00:44:00.231
and it makes sense to him and
then he was able to generalize

00:44:00.231 --> 00:44:04.398
that phrase into other
environments after this experience.

00:44:07.391 --> 00:44:10.827
(banging on drum)

00:44:10.827 --> 00:44:12.598
And we can jump ahead here a minute,

00:44:12.598 --> 00:44:15.038
just a little bit of a long clip.

00:44:15.038 --> 00:44:16.079
That's good.

00:44:16.079 --> 00:44:19.140
(banging on drum)

00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:21.973
(banging on drum)

00:44:29.148 --> 00:44:30.496
(child babbling)

00:44:30.496 --> 00:44:31.329
Yay.

00:44:31.329 --> 00:44:34.162
(banging on drum)

00:44:38.848 --> 00:44:40.598
- That's a great job.

00:44:41.442 --> 00:44:42.275
(laughing)

00:44:42.275 --> 00:44:44.270
(banging on drum)

00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:45.437
- This is fun.

00:44:47.822 --> 00:44:49.225
This is fun.

00:44:49.225 --> 00:44:50.243
- This is fun.

00:44:50.243 --> 00:44:53.076
(banging on drum)

00:45:05.929 --> 00:45:07.483
- Gonna blow out the speaker.

00:45:07.483 --> 00:45:10.483
(audience laughing)

00:45:12.957 --> 00:45:15.957
(audience laughing)

00:45:18.244 --> 00:45:20.099
We have an issue with the sound there?

00:45:20.099 --> 00:45:22.516
Oh, don't know what happened.

00:45:26.237 --> 00:45:27.885
Well without the sound,
it's kind of tough to see.

00:45:27.885 --> 00:45:30.135
(laughing)

00:45:31.349 --> 00:45:32.822
So essentially it goes
back and forth here,

00:45:32.822 --> 00:45:35.364
and then I start playing
the rhythm, you know,

00:45:35.364 --> 00:45:36.763
(tapping)
this is fun.

00:45:36.763 --> 00:45:38.439
And then he repeats it back and forth,

00:45:38.439 --> 00:45:42.108
and we get that idea, then I
go into just some more playful

00:45:42.108 --> 00:45:46.121
communication going back and
forth, sharing that moment,

00:45:46.121 --> 00:45:48.716
sharing that experience, and
then bringing back the idea

00:45:48.716 --> 00:45:51.341
of this is fun and eventually
I'll say this is fun

00:45:51.341 --> 00:45:53.924
without playing it on the drum.

00:45:56.762 --> 00:45:57.595
Alright.

00:45:59.527 --> 00:46:01.094
Great.

00:46:01.094 --> 00:46:02.244
Thank you so much.

00:46:02.244 --> 00:46:05.411
(audience applauding)
