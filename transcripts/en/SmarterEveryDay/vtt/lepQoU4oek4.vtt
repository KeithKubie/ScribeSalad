00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.800
Five, four, three, two, one, transit.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.680
Hey, it's me. Destin. Welcome back to Smarter Every Day. August 21st 2017. It's Matt Whitman,

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:12.820
It's Trevor.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.940
We're in the middle of Wyoming. This is a really special spot. You have to understand

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.860
we're on a reservation, and you're not allowed to come here.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.080
- No you're not allowed to come here.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.500
You're just not allowed to come here, but

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.080
the Lady that delivered Matt's

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:27.780
son?

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:28.520
-Yep.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.400
Midwife, owns this land. It's a big deal What's a really a big deal

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.480
Is that Trevor did the math

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.270
We started talking months ago. The international space station is going to transit in front of the eclipse, right?

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.899
It's going to happen. This is the spot. Like this is the exact spot

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.200
I'll let you know what the farmer said earlier today when we told him that his land was the spot.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.600
This is Mr. Fleming and this is his land. He leases this and he farms it and

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.400
You just found out that the space station is going to transit here?

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.820
Just found out. Didn't know anything about it.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.460
We had some extra solar film so we set up Mr. Fleming's old binoculars so he could watch the eclipse.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.460
We then took a few minutes and chatted about why we thought Crow Heart, Wyoming

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.960
 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.460
was the best possible place to watch it. You have the best spot in the U.S.

00:01:10.461 --> 00:01:11.900
-X marks the spot right here

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.600
Yeah, it does so here's the deal

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.890
So in Kentucky, they're going to get to see the eclipse longer

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:17.460
Twenty seconds.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.590
Twenty seconds longer

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.160
But here you get to see it for almost two and a half minutes and you get the transit of the international space station.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.680
We don't have anybody in Crow Heart, Wyoming.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.180
Really?

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.680
No.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.940
But this is a lot of activity for us here.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:33.580
Really?

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.980
Like the most that you've seen in your lifetime?

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.760
Yeah, since I've lived here.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.520
And how long is that?

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.000
I've been here 30 years.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.320
Yeah.  Are you ready for us to leave now?

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.115
 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.360
As soon as this is over.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.220
*laughter*

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.120
We'll get out of your hair, man. [Laughs]

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.120
We got Mr. Fleming set up with his binoculars here. So you're good to go

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.380
Is that a decent trade, letting us use your land to get your binoculars set up?

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.880
Good trade.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:02.380
(Laughter)

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.100
There's good people all over America. You know it.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.600
Oh, yeah.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.080
After 4 hours of setup we were super happy that the clouds cleared out, so we could finally see if the math was right.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.011
Hey come double check my focus if you get a second.

00:02:14.011 --> 00:02:15.120
- yeah, we got a minute.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.410
literally

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.029
Literally a minute now. 59 Seconds.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.960
You can see the sun spot sharp. That's good.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.030
40.
- 40 seconds

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.070
Look at everything and make sure that everything is rolling.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.460
Final touch of my camera.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:48.240
20

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:49.420
20 seconds.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.060
10

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.100
9

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.040

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.040

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.080

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.960
5

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.060
4

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.040
3

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.160
2

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.040
1

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.160
Transit.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.640
Oh! It happened! I saw it!

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:12.660
I totally saw it!

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:15.560
Dude!

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.140
-Did you see it? 
-No, I didn't see it. 
-It happened. I saw in the monitors.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.260
-Go back to your recorder.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.800
It happened.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.660
-You saw it?

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.790
-I swear. I saw it.

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.740
-Six, five, four, three

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.900
two, one

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.840
Transit.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.679
-Oh!  It happened!  I saw it! I totally saw it!

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.840
Dude!

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.320
(Music) four, three, two, one.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.480
Transit

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:46.080
There it was!

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.800
That is so awesome!

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:49.160
Dude!

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.780
Yes!

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.060
(Music)

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:10.700
The math worked.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:11.200
 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:18.329
This excitement from successfully getting the transit continued up until the point of the total eclipse where I was so blown away

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:24.220
I totally forgot everything I had practiced.  It was insane. My, my brain was saturated.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.960
This is my shadow band...peice, uh...

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.360
Did you come up with something?

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.440
-No, no I

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:30.340
-Bump it up.

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.260
-There it is.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:32.000
There they are.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
Look at that

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.320
That's weird.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.866
-One of the gopros has died.

00:04:38.866 --> 00:04:39.366
-That's cool

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.780
What?

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.280
(Camera clicking)

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.300
(Sounds of excitement)

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:47.740
That is crazy.

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.960
Oh, my word!

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:50.460
Take your glasses off!

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:52.660
(Kids laughing)

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:53.320
That is bizarre!

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:54.100
The stars!

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.880
Oh, wait...

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.720
It's overhead sunset.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:04.140
I had made up my mind ahead of time that no matter what happened with the photography at max eclipse

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.640
I was going to drop it all and go spend time with my family

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.570
Which is exactly what I did and it was really cool. This is awesome. I did so bad at this

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.499
I'm just going to give up.I did so bad. --What do you see?

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.560
Look around

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.080
That is crazy.

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.319
That cool look around behind you

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.610
ain't that wild

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.419
Look around guys look around ain't that cool

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:41.490
Look at the sun. I love the fact that this was so amazing to me that it just overrode my brain

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.140
I just wanted to experience it. I didn't I didn't think about making videos or taking good photos anymore

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.140
I just wanted to look at it

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.899
20 seconds, I totally bought stuff all about photography. I don't really care

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:04.889
Yeah, here it comes

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:14.039
What?

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:19.030
Wow

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:23.009
Watch it fade on I totally forgot about the drone. I never took my filter off

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:29.519
So yeah, I didn't get good photos. I didn't pull the filters off because I was kind of in the moment

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:35.340
And I really enjoyed it with my family Trevor however did get excellent photos and you can go check those out on his website

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:39.989
I'll leave links below, but man this was this was quite an experience

00:06:40.719 --> 00:06:42.069
Do you want a piece of gum?

00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:44.069
Would love a piece of gum

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:46.100
What did you think about the eclipse?

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:47.120
-It was awesome

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.200
Was it awesome? Cool, thanks for coming with me

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:51.180
-You're welcome

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.020
What you think sir?

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.020
Well, I want to thank you for these. -Yeah? They made all the difference in the world

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.040
Did they really? -Yeah

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.300
That's awesome, man -Yeah

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:00.780
Thanks for letting us hang out here!

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.640
Pretty weird -Yeah what'd you think? Did you cry?

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.000
No, I didn't cry-

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.580
You didn't cry? -I was glad to see the old sun come back [laughs]

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.120
-a hardened man like you?

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:11.879
'No, I've never cried"

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.980
I kind of I kind of got a little weird I got a little weird

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.360
Did you get weird? -I got weird.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.360
Do you wanna see the space station transit the sun?

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.760
-Yeah I'd love to

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:21.680
*three two one*

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:25.520
*Transit- Oh it happened I saw it!*

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:28.240
-there it was, size of a football field just flew in front

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.800
I'll be damned. huh. That's great

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.000
Follow my nose. I can't believe how fast that was. -yeah

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.620
*-one, Transit- Oh it happened I saw it!*

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:39.120
[Laughter]

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.460
I know you normally don't put swears on your videos

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.260
But you would be an idiot to leave that off

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:49.200
I'm a professional minister, and I don't think that even counts as a swear because he's a cowboy

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:53.160
What did you think? -I cried, tears of joy I couldn't not cry

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:55.970
Really? -Really. It's beautiful

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.460
What'd you think [unintelligible]?
-I get goosebumps

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:03.600
Okay, that's it. I am Destin. This is Trevor-

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:08.510
Trevor where can they find your stuff?
-patreon, patreon.com slash your name my name alright

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:11.300
I'll leave a link below and this is Matt, ten minute Bible hour

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:18.199
That's it the stars aligned, or 'the' star aligned with our stuff. That was cool. Anyway, I'm Destin

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.869
You're getting smarter every day. Have a good one

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:26.200
Can't believe my brain quit working. -I can. -Why?

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.040
-Weird that you can't believe it. -Really?

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:32.869
It's weird that you're surprised about it. Of course your brain quit working

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:35.240
That was awesome
