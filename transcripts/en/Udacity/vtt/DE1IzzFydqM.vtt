00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.509
I'm back again.

00:00:01.509 --> 00:00:05.210
This time with a really small segment.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:07.620
We need to plug two histograms.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.330
So first we need the values for
two stocks.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.570
We get data for two stocks,
which is SPY and XOM.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.300
We also go ahead and compute daily
returns for each of the stock.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.980
Note that our daily return data frame
will have daily return values for

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.960
each of the stock prices.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.990
Now like before, we just call histogram
function on the daily return data frame,

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.270
and let's see what happens.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.390
We keep the bins count to be 20.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.645
Now let's run this.

00:00:39.645 --> 00:00:42.230
Okay, so we got two subplots.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.140
But we go ahead one step and
plot them on the same x and

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.720
y axis so that we can compare
the histogram of SPY and XOM.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.740
To get two histograms on the same x and
y axis, we call the histogram

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:01.510
functions separately on each of
the stocks daily return values.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.290
We also add the label parameter so

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.570
that we can differentiate between
the histogram of the SPY and XOM.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.420
Now, let's run this.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.390
Here we go.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.140
We get two histogram of SPY and
XOM on the same X and Y axis.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.390
Now you can compare the histogram and

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.990
see that the teams of XOM is
thin as compared to the SPY.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.895
That's it for this coding segment.

00:01:27.895 --> 00:01:29.800
I'll be back soon.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:30.790
Over to you professor.
