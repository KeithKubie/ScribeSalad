ROB KENNER: Welcome everybody.

00:00:03.214 --> 00:00:04.130
My name is Rob Kenner.

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.100
I'm a senior editor
at Complex Media.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.420
And I'm glad that all of
you could join us here

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.000
in the flesh and
digitally, virtually around

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.930
the Google diaspora.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.050
And I'm joined by Mr. Marc Ecko.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:19.800
Round of applause.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.740
MARC ECKO: Then they add
like the "roar" track.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.120
You'll just cut that in.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.112
It'll be like [ROAR].

00:00:31.112 --> 00:00:33.070
ROB KENNER: Or the Norman
Lear canned laughter.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.740
MARC ECKO: Right, right.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.615
With the delayed hand clap.

00:00:38.615 --> 00:00:40.490
ROB KENNER: We're counting
on the laugh lines

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.060
to go over really big today.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.540
So please participate.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.760
MARC ECKO: Follow the
applaud signs if you will.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.320
ROB KENNER: So you
may know Marc Ecko

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.200
as the designer of the
rhinoceros t-shirts

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.950
and as a fly MC.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.245
There's a lot of different
items on his resume.

00:01:00.245 --> 00:01:06.270
But today he's here in
the guise of an author.

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.000
His book "Unlabel, Selling
You Without Selling Out"

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.599
is, as he describes
it, the textbook you

00:01:13.599 --> 00:01:15.140
wish you had when
you were in school.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.040
MARC ECKO: Yes.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.282
Yes.

00:01:17.282 --> 00:01:19.100
ROB KENNER: Now it's
called "Unlabel."

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.240
MARC ECKO: Yes.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.560
ROB KENNER: Tell me what labels
were put on you that you undid.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.250
MARC ECKO: Well,
what I try to do

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.030
with the book was build
a kind of a business book

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.820
for the creative class.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.140
And in an age where we
have all these efficiencies

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.970
of self-broadcasting
because of digital media,

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.330
I wanted to write
a book that had

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.180
a subtext about
personal branding,

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.220
but without being this
patronizing, goopy, personal

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.850
branding book, which those
books tend to be like.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.170
So the spirit of
the name "Unlabel"

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.810
was-- it had a few meanings.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.400
One, the brand that I launched
was called Ecko Unlimited,

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.440
so it's playing up on the U-N
like the "un" from "unlimited."

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.770
And secondly, I was playing
up on this notion of the fact

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.610
that we-- it's just
human nature-- people

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:16.940
project labels onto us.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.960
They want to organize us in
the world like a product,

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.080
if we like it or not,
if we know it or not,

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.110
sometimes with good intent
or with decent intent

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.240
to make people's
lives more efficient,

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.290
sometimes with kind
of not so good intent.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.090
So in a world where people
are so easily spewing

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.380
out their persona,
their brand, I

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.270
was trying to make
the reader flatfooted

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.160
and have kind of an analog
conversation about what

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.420
it means to build a personal
brand, what it means to live up

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.030
to that brand, the brand
that you perceive-- which

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.480
is the label, like
the exterior veneer,

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.134
the flourishes, the
outside packaging.

00:02:59.134 --> 00:03:01.300
And the label you have to
put to bed at night, which

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.210
is the one that's
guts to the skin.

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.130
So how do you discern
and distinguish

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.350
between your inside brand, your
inside label and your exterior

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.910
one?

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.650
And how do you not parrot,
either within intent

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.770
or with poor intent
or misguided intent

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.160
to the perceived skin
to the world brand.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.700
So the book, in a
digital age, tries

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.930
to have a not too serious
conversation but something that

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.590
helps people understand
my philosophy on branding

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.460
and maybe how that might be
helpful to their personal

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.940
brand, if it's their personal
singular brand or their group

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.680
collective "we" company brand.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.090
ROB KENNER: Now what I
love about the book is

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.740
it's not like a typical
sort of Trump book,

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.550
where it's all about
the Ws and the Ls

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.010
kind of get airbrushed out.

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.422
MARC ECKO: Right.

00:04:00.422 --> 00:04:04.120
ROB KENNER: To be clear, you did
grow an air brushing business

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.230
from your parents garage into
a company with $1 billion

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.130
in revenue.

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.680
MARC ECKO: That's right.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.388
ROB KENNER: And you
founded Complex Media

00:04:10.388 --> 00:04:11.980
which is killing
the game right now.

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:12.940
MARC ECKO: Yup.

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.520
ROB KENNER: But let's
talk about the Ls,

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.430
because those are
teachable moments.

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.709
MARC ECKO: I think
this book is designed

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:28.000
not to be what a lot of
those very 90s-style, Type

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.101
A personality business
books, like the guy

00:04:30.101 --> 00:04:32.350
parachutes out of the plane
like Richard Branson-style

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.360
and doesn't fail.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.705
I think this book
is more of-- instead

00:04:36.705 --> 00:04:38.080
of being a book
on greatest hits,

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.310
it's more of a book
on my greatest misses.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:48.700
And I'm someone who really likes
to be honest and even painfully

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:55.230
at times masochistically
honest about my idiosyncrasies,

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:00.810
my failures, just because it's--
I don't believe how failures

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.290
are taught to be in school, that
you should be ashamed of them.

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.470
Like K through 12, the sentence
we all go through that K

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.620
through 12 sentence
that we all get,

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.210
no matter the state puts
us through, public, private

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.240
or otherwise, we're taught
that failure something

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.170
to be embarrassed by.

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:22.225
It's something you ridicule,
something to be ashamed by.

00:05:22.225 --> 00:05:25.230
And it's just funny
how in business

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.516
that success never really
quite looks like an A,

00:05:28.516 --> 00:05:30.780
and failure never
quite looks like an F.

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.240
And how much value there is
in the learnings of failure.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.000
So I try to have a really honest
conversation about failure,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.080
and put it out there in a
way that maybe people have

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.030
perceived me as this guy
that's built this big business

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.930
and has collected all
this stuff-- right?

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.640
The trappings of success.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.150
But I didn't make the
book about gushing around

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.530
about the stuff I collected.

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.980
Like the real value and the
real wealth that I talk about

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.820
in the book, the
wealth that matters,

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:04.080
can't really be
counted like money.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.880
And it's funny how the
wealth that matters

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.156
can be distributed
differently as well.

00:06:08.156 --> 00:06:09.880
ROB KENNER: Definitely.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.085
There is a part
in the book where

00:06:12.085 --> 00:06:14.330
you talk about
getting into denim,

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:19.040
and your way of feeling
your way through that.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.602
And I thought that was
an instructive anecdote.

00:06:21.602 --> 00:06:23.560
Is there a way you could
boil that down for me?

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.000
MARC ECKO: Was that the
part in the book where

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.300
I meet with Wu, the
dentist supplier?

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:29.130
I can't remember.

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:30.080
ROB KENNER: Yeah.

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.050
And the rivets.

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:35.700
MARC ECKO: Oh, right right,
Look, today the world

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:42.530
we live in, young designers
and young product makers today,

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:45.619
the world's a much
different world.

00:06:45.619 --> 00:06:47.910
There's this thing, you guys
probably have heard of it,

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:50.000
it's called Google.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.830
So if you ask it, you can
find out a lot of shit.

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:56.947
Back when I was coming
up, like the Google

00:06:56.947 --> 00:06:59.030
was like looking at the
inside label of whatever I

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:00.600
was wearing.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:04.800
I'd look at the inside of
my Gap hoodie or whatever,

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.190
and it was like
"Made in Hong Kong."

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:08.550
Like, where is Hong Kong?

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:10.670
Is that by India?

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:14.200
Much of my education was so so.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.070
But I literally
just packed a bag

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:17.920
and found myself over there.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.030
But was only after
I attempted to try

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:23.257
to figure it all
out in the States.

00:07:23.257 --> 00:07:25.090
And that's the anecdote
you're asking about,

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:31.630
where I had found a denim
maker-- I forget where they

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:36.150
were in the South
somewhere-- and they

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:41.360
put like all the rivets and
shanks on in the wrong manner.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.360
And they all popped off.

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.250
So I remember shipping
them months late,

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:47.260
and then having-- after we
got the first return-- having

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:51.830
to manually fix that stuff
ourselves in our warehouses.

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:56.459
But there are a lot of
anecdotes like that,

00:07:56.459 --> 00:07:58.125
stuff that you don't
really contemplate,

00:07:58.125 --> 00:08:00.640
like the consequences
of the things you make

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:05.350
and the complexities of them,
and how they affect your--

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:09.390
you don't anticipate that
they're going to go wrong.

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:10.287
But they do.

00:08:10.287 --> 00:08:11.120
ROB KENNER: They do.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.630
MARC ECKO: Yup, they do.

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:14.910
ROB KENNER: But what I
love about your candor

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:16.950
in telling these
stories, is it gets back

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:19.900
to this idea of authenticity,
keeping it real,

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:23.770
in hop hop lingo.

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:27.090
You actually break down
the formula of authenticity

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:30.560
in the book, which is kind
of a closely guarded secret.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.409
I mentioned that Malcolm
Gladwell gave you

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:35.295
props for attempting to
break down authenticity.

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:40.780
It's sort of akin to
the Google algorithm.

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:44.179
How do you penetrate the
mystery of authenticity.

00:08:44.179 --> 00:08:46.420
MARC ECKO: I think it
was a little bit what

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:48.460
a part of the book is
about, and the book

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:51.790
being framed like a
textbook, was a little bit

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:58.500
taking the piss out of these
kind of prescriptive methods

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:02.570
of arriving at a best practice,
as if you could really

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:05.680
prescribe an for authenticity.

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.450
It's like we all bought
into that whole e equals

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:12.320
mc squared thing, but I
mean, have we vetted it.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:12.820
Really?

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:14.278
Like we all just
agree, because you

00:09:14.278 --> 00:09:16.370
see the guy with the crazy hair.

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:18.760
And we were all told "genius."

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.260
And I mean yeah,
I'm not trying to--

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:21.730
ROB KENNER: Well, guys with
crazy hair are always geniuses.

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:24.070
MARC ECKO: Right, I mean,
I know this from Rob.

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:28.120
So we all know this, right?

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:35.110
But to your point, hop hop
and coming up in the '80s

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:37.510
when hip hop was this thing
you had to go find it.

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:39.720
It didn't find you in the
way that it kind of is so

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:43.520
woven into popular culture and
consumer products and our media

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:47.710
narratives and our language.

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:51.330
So there was in its kind
of prepubescent phase,

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:53.490
hip hop had this
awkwardness about it,

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:57.470
about its comfort or lack of
comfort around commercializing

00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:00.360
itself, around quote
"crossing over."

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.200
So there was a lot
of tension coming up

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.840
in the '80s around
"keeping it real"

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:07.490
and this notion of
what's real, what's not,

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:09.950
what's authentic, what's not.

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:12.340
And there were all kinds
of layers of subtext there

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:16.860
that, depending on who you
ask, had different meanings.

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:18.430
But that was certainly
something that

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:22.010
was one of the things
that kind of dogged hip

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:26.250
hop in its kind of early
prepubescent years.

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:31.740
Even to this day, real hard
core hip hop enthusiasts

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:34.870
will take a default,
almost cynical view

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:37.430
on anything that
tries to commercialize

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:39.740
in a certain way, where the
monetization strategy is

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:41.600
kind of overt.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:45.740
Less today, but certainly
when I was coming up.

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:50.687
So that was a theme in
the subtext of my story

00:10:50.687 --> 00:10:51.770
and is a part of the book.

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:56.900
that kind of always having an
answer to quote "gatekeepers,"

00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:00.870
who would challenge what
was authentic or not.

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:05.010
So not being kind of blue blood
pedigree fashion designer,

00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:07.260
you can imagine what it was
like to get into the CFDA.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:08.676
And I talk about
that in the book.

00:11:08.676 --> 00:11:10.810
The Council of Fashion
Designers of America.

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:14.520
And some of those
kind of cultural I'll

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:17.750
use the word-- prejudices
that that ecosystem has

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:22.422
as gatekeepers around street
wear and urban fashion design.

00:11:22.422 --> 00:11:24.130
MARC ECKO: Just the
word urban in itself.

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:26.004
ROB KENNER: Right, its
like so loaded, right?

00:11:26.004 --> 00:11:28.080
So that's not real
fashion design.

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.110
It's not authentic.

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:32.660
And then all the way down to
like coming up in my Rutgers

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:38.450
college age is like, look,
white Jewish kid, into hip hop,

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:41.410
going to Rutgers, it was nothing
like Lakewood in that Lakewood

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:44.990
was kind of this
microcosm, and then

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:48.200
Rutgers is much more
of a macrochosm of how

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:52.860
people really kind of
socially accepted people

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:56.680
cross kind of racial
lines and boundaries.

00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:01.550
So coming up in the early
'90s, I graduated high school

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:04.265
in 1990-- so going
off to Rutgers,

00:12:04.265 --> 00:12:06.140
there were definitely
people that looked down

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:07.880
their nose-- black and
white and otherwise.

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.630
Right there were kind
of like a little bit

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:12.456
skeptical, like who's this
kid, coming up in this space,

00:12:12.456 --> 00:12:14.330
airbrushing t-shirts,
talking about graffiti.

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:16.820
That's not really
graffiti, That's airbrush.

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:18.070
That's not authentic.

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:20.470
So what the book
attempts to do is

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:24.430
take what the best practices
of authenticity are.

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:27.940
And I assign this formula--
it's kind of convoluted.

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:29.130
It's a little clunky.

00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:32.860
But I think it frames the
real important components

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:35.030
to creating an
authentic expression,

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:40.260
an authentic interaction,
communication,

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.870
and the components
just on a high level.

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:46.040
There is the notion
of the unique voice,

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:49.890
the role of selfishness,
one's creative selfishness

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:55.260
and intent, which is often
when we get all kumbaya

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.150
and want to design
by committee, we

00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:58.800
lose that selfish perspective.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:06.590
Truthfulness, being
defined by your ability

00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:08.210
to do more than you say.

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:11.260
Because a lot culturally,
we're just busy talking.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:15.460
And in this era of
social media, we almost

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:18.359
think because we
said it, we did it.

00:13:18.359 --> 00:13:19.275
ROB KENNER: [CHUCKLES]

00:13:19.275 --> 00:13:20.710
MARC ECKO: But it's not really.

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:27.330
Like talking and action-- two
discernibly different things.

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:30.610
So but really, I take
the piss out of it.

00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:33.236
E Yeah, there's this guideline,
but it's not that prescriptive,

00:13:33.236 --> 00:13:34.818
like (MOCK TELEVISION
ANNOUNCER VOICE]

00:13:34.818 --> 00:13:37.150
here's step one through
five on how to be authentic

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:39.050
and have an authentic
interaction at work.

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:39.300
Right?

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:40.258
No, it's not like that.

00:13:40.258 --> 00:13:43.940
It is by design philosophical
and modeled in a way

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:47.010
to kind of make you flatfooted
so that people kind of come

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:53.030
to the terms of well, that
was his way of prescribing

00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:59.790
to the core spine of his brand,
which in his view, in my view,

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:02.630
was the desire to be as
transparent and as authentic

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:06.250
as possible, good,
bad and indifferent.

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:09.380
ROB KENNER: Now this idea of
selling out, as you mentioned,

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:13.500
is less of a hindrance
to hip hop today.

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:17.610
The pursuit of profit is nothing
to be ashamed of anymore.

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:20.990
And I would say probably one
of the cultural figures who

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:22.734
helped usher that
it in was Puffy.

00:14:22.734 --> 00:14:23.900
MARC ECKO: Yeah, Sean Combs.

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:25.820
ROB KENNER: It's all
about the benjamins.

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:28.129
Yeah, we call him
Puffy from those days.

00:14:28.129 --> 00:14:28.670
Diddy, today.

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:30.660
MARC ECKO: Diddy.

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:34.070
ROB KENNER: Talk about how
he served as a kind of a Yoda

00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:34.945
for you.

00:14:34.945 --> 00:14:36.820
MARC ECKO: Yeah, I talk
about in the book how

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:39.890
I have these kind of
unintentional Yodas,

00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:42.430
that they don't necessarily
always dress or look the part.

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:46.520
And they don't always
answer the question

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:50.580
by answering the question but
rather by asking the question.

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:53.330
So in some ways, Puff was
like this interesting, almost

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:55.860
Cheshire cat-like
character, who seemed

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:58.420
to be able to be in more
than one place at once.

00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:02.070
And I perceive that
brand of celebrity

00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:04.690
as what, if I wanted
to kind of quote

00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:08.930
"get that red carpet heat,"
the thing to parrot to.

00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:11.480
And I quickly learned that
I wasn't built for that.

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.920
That's what I talk
about in the book.

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:17.910
But there was a lot
that he taught me just

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:24.120
in relationship to being more
true to what I was defining

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:29.070
as quote "success" for creating
media attention for myself,

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:31.760
rather than trying
to parrot to more

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:36.060
of a kind of brash,
entertainer style kind of grab

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:39.215
for media, which
came to him innately.

00:15:42.175 --> 00:15:46.200
So there's many characters
like that throughout the book,

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:53.164
in my journey, that were
able to glean a lot from.

00:15:53.164 --> 00:15:54.580
ROB KENNER: You
have a cover blurb

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:58.825
from George Lucas,
which is kind of baller.

00:15:58.825 --> 00:16:00.342
MARC ECKO: Not bad.

00:16:00.342 --> 00:16:02.050
ROB KENNER: I mean,
he goes on at length.

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:03.716
And there's a photo
of you two building.

00:16:03.716 --> 00:16:06.340
I know you're a
big Star Wars fan.

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:09.070
How did you actually
connect with this guy,

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:10.609
who had such an impact on--

00:16:10.609 --> 00:16:12.400
MARC ECKO: Well, one
of things I talk about

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:15.280
as a ingredient in the
formula of authenticity

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:19.890
is this notion of the
range of emotional impact.

00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:23.210
And the importance of
creating emotional impacts

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:25.410
as a product of what you do.

00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:27.930
It's not what you make, it's
how you make people feel.

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:32.130
So I use the anecdote on how
I got to George Lucas, who

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:35.710
I'm obviously a fanboy
of, and in a lot of ways,

00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:37.560
I learn more from
studying his business,

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:42.590
in terms of how he configured
his business around licensing.

00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:45.340
Then I did, let's say, out of
studying Calvin Klein or Ralph

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:48.605
Lauren, I was able
to extrapolate more--

00:16:48.605 --> 00:16:50.980
it came to me, the
learnings of licensing

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:53.870
came to me more intuitively
through studying him,

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:57.870
than folks in the fashion space.

00:16:57.870 --> 00:17:00.120
But the way that I got to
him, in that kind of pursuit

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:03.290
of creating emotional impact,
is that-- well, actually

00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:07.339
funny enough, I saw
there was a fundraiser,

00:17:07.339 --> 00:17:09.910
and they were going to honor
George Lucas here in the city.

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:11.650
And I got invited to it.

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:13.764
They wanted us to buy a table.

00:17:13.764 --> 00:17:15.930
So I'm thinking oh shit,
George Lucas will be there.

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:17.346
I can bum rush
him, and it's going

00:17:17.346 --> 00:17:21.076
to be like I can finally meet
him, get like a photo op.

00:17:21.076 --> 00:17:22.534
This is pre-Instagram--
whoops, I'm

00:17:22.534 --> 00:17:24.300
not supposed to say
Instagram inside of Google.

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:24.940
ROB KENNER: Oops!

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:27.170
Or I could've Google Plused
with him-- only kidding.

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:31.040
All right.

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:33.040
I think Google should
have an Instagram account.

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:35.060
I'm just saying I think
it would be funny.

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:36.020
I think it'd be funny.

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:36.670
All right, whatever.

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:38.210
ROB KENNER: We'll
edit that later.

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:39.569
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:17:39.569 --> 00:17:41.360
MARC ECKO: There's the
uncomfortable Google

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.396
laugh in the back.

00:17:43.396 --> 00:17:44.770
ROB KENNER: More
of this to come.

00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:47.103
MARC ECKO: But I thought that
that would be really cool,

00:17:47.103 --> 00:17:51.820
so sure enough, 11th hour,
about to go to this event.

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:53.570
I forget what the
crisis was, had

00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:55.490
to go put out a
forest fire somewhere,

00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:58.610
like in my production pipeline,
I had trouble overseas.

00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:02.505
So we were just launching
at around that time complex,

00:18:02.505 --> 00:18:06.150
and I remember I was going to
bring the new complex staff

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:11.020
and some of my echomarketing
marketing team to that dinner.

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:13.740
And at the 11th hour,
I find I can't go.

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:16.000
So it occurs to
me, I say I'm going

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.670
to send my action figure--
I have a 12-inch action

00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:23.060
figure of George Lucas, this
really rare, collectible action

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:25.960
figure I got from like from
should Shebooya or somewhere

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:29.317
like in Tokyo somewhere, like
some like cool random toy spot.

00:18:29.317 --> 00:18:31.900
Like the spot where they're like
"not for sale, not for sale,"

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:33.877
and you're like "its for sale."

00:18:33.877 --> 00:18:35.585
ROB KENNER: You just
keeping peeling off.

00:18:35.585 --> 00:18:38.240
MARC ECKO: Just
peeling off the bills.

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:43.134
So I say to my man, who
so one of my good friends

00:18:43.134 --> 00:18:45.550
worked for me for years and
now has his own little agency.

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:48.880
A guy named Coltrane
Curtis, not so little.

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:53.730
I say train-- take a
picture with little George

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:54.440
and big George.

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:56.860
If there's anything
that happens tonight,

00:18:56.860 --> 00:19:00.460
get a picture of little
George with big George.

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:01.190
Can you do that?

00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:05.270
He's like I can do that, right.

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:06.820
I remember I come
back from the trip,

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:08.370
and he has printed
out-- those were

00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:11.470
the days you printed photos?

00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:13.010
At a pharmacy?

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:14.440
It's crazy?

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:16.100
Crazy technology.

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:19.300
So like Gutenberg style.

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:22.680
And he had a stack of photos
with Little George and Big

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:25.070
George together, and
like little George

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:27.710
and like real little
Martin Scorsese,

00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:29.375
who's little in real life.

00:19:29.375 --> 00:19:30.365
ROB KENNER: [GUFFAWS]

00:19:30.365 --> 00:19:32.450
MARC ECKO: So there was
all these great phot--

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:35.920
so years later, victory.

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:37.400
So that was like
my first instance

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:39.240
of an emotional
impact as a product.

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:41.360
I don't know that's
what I was designing

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.120
in terms of that instance.

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:44.310
Right?

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:47.400
Years later, another
fundraiser, where

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:49.900
Spike Lee was celebrating
the anniversary of like 40

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:53.495
Acres and a Mule, and he did a
thing on like a Carnival Cruise

00:19:53.495 --> 00:19:56.120
line, like a new Carnival Cruise
line, that pulled to the city.

00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:57.320
And I said, of course,
I'm going to go.

00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:58.595
And I didn't even
know that George Lucas

00:19:58.595 --> 00:19:59.511
was going to be there.

00:19:59.511 --> 00:20:01.830
So walk in, and I
see George Lucas.

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:03.630
He's like in my line of sight.

00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:07.314
And he's wearing a white
linen, double breasted suit--

00:20:07.314 --> 00:20:08.980
it was a Naval theme,
like a Navy theme.

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:11.990
He was looking like
Gatsby, like harsh.

00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:14.450
You know, really,
like-- his hair.

00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:16.260
I don't know how does that.

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:19.030
So I see him, and I walk up.

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:20.700
And I see that
there's just some guy.

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:24.640
this douchebags from
Kodak, getting in his ear

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:27.340
about how his-- [DEEP VOICE]
"George, your films just

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:28.080
don't look warm.

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:30.832
Like they used to, when
they were on film."

00:20:30.832 --> 00:20:32.040
And he's just getting at him.

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:34.500
So I break out my
little BlackBerry

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:36.150
at the time, which
was like-- there

00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:37.775
used to be a company
called BlackBerry.

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:44.930
And I had it with a
little Yoda etched in it.

00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:47.320
So and I go [MAKES
SPACESHIP NOISES].

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:49.940
I walk right up to
him, really loud,

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:51.990
and I'm like [SOUND
BECOMES LIGHT SABER NOISE].

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:56.260
Like Lord Lucas,
is there any more

00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:58.130
that I should remove their head.

00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:01.220
And he starts laughing, like
the douchebag guy walks away.

00:21:03.672 --> 00:21:05.130
I start to chat
and I'm like do you

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:07.140
remember meeting little George?

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:08.960
And he's like what
are you talking about?

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.520
That 12-inch action figure.

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:11.630
That was mine.

00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:13.442
That was kind of the
way that I connected.

00:21:13.442 --> 00:21:15.400
ROB KENNER: Wow, you blew
his mind right there.

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:15.870
MARC ECKO: Yeah!

00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:17.745
So between the
[SPACESHIP/LIGHT_SABER_NOISE],

00:21:17.745 --> 00:21:21.180
the saber sounds and
that much planning,

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:23.780
he was like you know what,
I will take a meeting.

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:29.770
So I asked for a meeting
to contemplate him,

00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:32.020
if he would license
the archives to do

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:33.520
some stuff with our
fashion product.

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:35.020
And we did that for years.

00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:36.220
So it was really cool,

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:37.136
ROB KENNER: Very cool.

00:21:37.136 --> 00:21:39.470
Yeah, so with that have
been technically speaking

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:41.550
a swag bomb.

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:43.910
MARC ECKO: I think that's an
instance of-- because swag

00:21:43.910 --> 00:21:47.156
bombs are usually solicited
via mail or by delivery.

00:21:47.156 --> 00:21:49.030
ROB KENNER: But had
little George was sort of

00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:50.950
like a three-years
prior swagger.

00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:54.820
That was probably kind of
more of that notion of don't

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:56.750
underestimate.

00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:59.680
When you want to make
an impact, on someone.

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:01.850
I mean don't take your
shirt in front of them.

00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:03.580
Don't do like wacky
stuff like that

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:06.240
or like anti-social or
not too anti-social.

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:09.860
But there's something to be
said about deliberately thought

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:15.480
out meaningful
human interactions.

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:17.040
And that when you
could do something

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:20.520
bespoke for someone
and for young people

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:23.100
coming up with their businesses
and new products or services,

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:26.000
not to underestimate the
value of a those kind

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:26.840
of interactions.

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:31.330
Not to just presume, because
you sent an email with a PDF,

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:33.850
like that's going
to seal the deal.

00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:36.299
And then the sense
of gratification

00:22:36.299 --> 00:22:37.590
because hey, I checked the box.

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:38.800
I sent it.

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:41.690
Not to underestimate
showing up-- and again,

00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:45.750
not being like stalker, weirdo--
of swag bonds in the book,

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:49.740
as how I did early
product placement, where

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:54.360
I would airbrush jackets
and T-shirts and give away

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:58.082
stuff to like emerging
celebrities in the music scene.

00:22:58.082 --> 00:22:59.540
ROB KENNER: DJ Red
Alert was first.

00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:01.331
MARC ECKO: Yeah, cool
DJ red alert, and was

00:23:01.331 --> 00:23:05.970
see here, like a New York
City legendary iconic,

00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:10.080
both influential, in
at the label level.

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:12.900
And on the radio level, in
terms of this relationship

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:15.020
with a tribe called
Quest, and all

00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:17.400
of like the kind
of native tongue--

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:18.570
ROB KENNER: BCP!

00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:21.210
MARC ECKO: Yeah,
BDP, all these guys.

00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:25.200
But I would send-- those
were like mailed packages

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:27.080
but very customly made.

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:31.110
And a lot of people ask me that
are in services businesses,

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:35.080
that are like well, I guess how
swag bombs could be meaningful,

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:37.760
because you had a product
and you could customize it

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:40.830
into an actual tangible product.

00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:43.690
And I said it's hard
for me to do that,

00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:45.880
because I have some
sass, B2B, some product.

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:48.210
And I said, well, bullshit.

00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:50.840
Your product is
ultimately satisfying

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:54.940
some kind of analog thing
for whoever is using it,

00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:58.340
either it's saving them
time or it's saving them

00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:01.460
money or a blend of all
of the above, whatever.

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:04.870
So you thinking
about what object

00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:07.950
expresses or is a metaphor
for what your product does.

00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:10.890
And delivering it to
someone, there's value to it.

00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:12.890
It's old school, but
there's real value to that.

00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:14.389
And a lot of people
just think well,

00:24:14.389 --> 00:24:17.935
I send flowers or
a bottle of Wine

00:24:17.935 --> 00:24:19.440
or a nice handwritten note.

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:20.162
No, ike really?

00:24:20.162 --> 00:24:21.870
Be deliberate and
think about that stuff.

00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:24.020
It's really powerful,
and to this day,

00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:27.330
I get things-- like the things
that really impact me are--

00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:29.320
when peopl and since
I've wrote the book,

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:31.257
I've seen to beginning
a lot more swag bombs.

00:24:31.257 --> 00:24:33.340
MARC ECKO: All right, then
people are catching on.

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:33.840
MARC ECKO: Yeah.

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:35.506
At least they're
trying to play to that.

00:24:35.506 --> 00:24:37.985
And I warn people in the
book, please don't do that.

00:24:37.985 --> 00:24:39.360
ROB KENNER: And
not to the house.

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:40.912
MARC ECKO: Right,
now to the house.

00:24:40.912 --> 00:24:42.620
Which I've gotten,
which is really weird.

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:44.140
ROB KENNER: Creepy.

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:48.220
No, but I love the
image of you straight

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:51.760
spamming the fax
machine of 98.7 KISS

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:53.480
while Red Alert is on the air.

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:54.480
MARC ECKO: That's right.

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:55.979
ROB KENNER: And
then, eventually you

00:24:55.979 --> 00:24:58.000
send them the custom
jacket, and he gives you

00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.530
the big shout out on air.

00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:03.720
MARC ECKO: Yeah, I would
go to the Kinko's, and I

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:09.920
would draw these really
custom-drawn illustrated cover

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:10.520
letters.

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:12.330
And I would just
spam the hell out

00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:15.950
of-- like he had to
recognize my solicitation.

00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:19.350
I figured I'm worthy
of a shout-out.

00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:20.790
And then he eventually did.

00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:22.210
And that was very cool.

00:25:22.210 --> 00:25:24.240
ROB KENNER: It's good stuff.

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:27.910
You talk about a dream of
Tommy Hilfiger in the book,

00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:30.920
how he comes to you in a vision.

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:35.400
And it's a kind of a
surreal image actually.

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:39.870
You show up at the sort
of imaginary-- Hilfiger

00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:45.141
perfect chateau with sort of
mannequin model characters, all

00:25:45.141 --> 00:25:45.640
of them.

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:48.310
But then he's a
little bit disheveled

00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:51.490
and it seems a little different
than you might have expected.

00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:53.270
MARC ECKO: Well,
what I was trying

00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:55.675
to do in the subtext
of that little--

00:25:55.675 --> 00:25:59.660
and it's a persistent theme
throughout the book, which

00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:02.620
is this notion that
seems to be people

00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:07.120
have really kind of stuff to
with the book, which is look we

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:10.560
live in a culture where
perception is reality.

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:14.180
I mean my first PR
person told me that.

00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:17.350
And the book, I try to
testify, say, hey, well,

00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:18.575
actually reality is reality,

00:26:18.575 --> 00:26:19.200
ROB KENNER: OK.

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:22.200
MARC ECKO: And a
lot of our judgments

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.970
and our relationships
with other people

00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:27.100
are informed by those
games of perception.

00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:29.370
Again back to the very
first question of the brand

00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:31.720
you perceive skin to the
world versus the brand that's

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:35.430
like the interior, inside
guts of the skin brand.

00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:38.450
So that dream is
kind of me taking

00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:41.410
the piss out of my own
relationship with the fashion

00:26:41.410 --> 00:26:46.180
industry, my expectations
of acceptance or kind

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:51.500
of peer review, my wantedness
of a peer acceptance

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:56.920
from whom I perceive as
the elite of fashion.

00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:58.920
Because those were
the gatekeepers.

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:02.480
So in the dream, which
look, I embellish

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:03.830
because it's a book, right?

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:05.970
And I was trying to be
a little bit hyperbolic,

00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:08.880
but I do recall that
whole interaction

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:10.570
and timing being
very serendipitous,

00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:12.194
because I had an
interaction with Tommy

00:27:12.194 --> 00:27:13.750
in real life at that same time.

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:17.440
So it's kind of almost like
my psyche warning me like,

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:19.530
dude it's not going to
be what you think it is.

00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:22.540
Like it's not what you
think it's going to be like

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:25.900
you visualize this
ultra sexy glamorous

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:28.190
perfect like
everything-- because I

00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:33.640
imagine how we perceive it to
be like to work for Google.

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:36.530
But it probably like for a
lot of people socks, Right?

00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:37.940
So let's be-- not terrible.

00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:39.290
ROB KENNER: We can talk
in private afterwards.

00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:39.390
I

00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:41.280
MARC ECKO: I mean,
stock options are great.

00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:43.610
But I mean your boss is a dick.

00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:46.240
Not Larry and Sergey, but like
the guy you really report to.

00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:51.180
Because people are
emotional creatures.

00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:56.500
But I think that
section of the book kind

00:27:56.500 --> 00:28:02.400
of kind of getting
comfortable in my skin,

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:05.290
with my own relationship
with my career,

00:28:05.290 --> 00:28:08.440
because I always
kind of begrudged

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:11.210
like I was the schlepper who
painted t-shirts in my garage,

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:14.480
because if that was
something to not be proud of,

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:17.270
rather than use that kind
of rough around the edges,

00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:20.985
crunchy on the outside, soft
in the middle kind of vibe

00:28:20.985 --> 00:28:24.480
as my entryway in business.

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:27.354
And I talk about that's when
I was launching Mark Echo

00:28:27.354 --> 00:28:28.770
Cut-and-Sew , and
so I had a case,

00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:31.620
a fierce case of
Ralph Lauren-itis.

00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:36.570
it's like I try to pair the kind
of best practices of the elite,

00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:40.100
best in class, in an industry.

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:44.730
Like he's an ambassador-grade
level practitioner.

00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:47.260
And what the world
doesn't need someone

00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:49.460
being a bad copy
of Ralph Lauren.

00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:52.470
The world needs Mark
Echo growing up.

00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:55.130
And I thought that
the world needed

00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:57.590
another-- like do as Ralph does.

00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:59.130
And not that Ralph
Lauren-itis, it

00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:01.845
wasn't to begrudge or
disparage Ralph Lauren.

00:29:01.845 --> 00:29:03.930
He's G-O-A-T, right?

00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:07.640
Like "goat" -- real
grace of all time.

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:10.640
But that can happen
in other industries.

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:14.380
I know other guys in
technology, engineers, marketing

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:19.610
guys that have this kind
of weird relationship

00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:21.840
with what they perceive
to be greatness,

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:25.680
and then they end up a lot of
their career actually finding

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:29.655
their way by parodying them
rather than kind of embracing

00:29:29.655 --> 00:29:31.280
good, bad, indifferent,
the things that

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:34.200
define their strengths and
sometimes their weaknesses

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:35.790
to differentiate them.

00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:39.747
And I kind of came comfortable
in my own skin, saying look,

00:29:39.747 --> 00:29:40.580
I'm an artist first.

00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:41.930
I'm an Illustrator.

00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:43.380
I'm a strong Illustrator.

00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:46.980
Like I have way ahead of
my fashion design skills.

00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:49.520
So I've now with
older age become

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:52.120
more comfortable, just
for better or worse,

00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:53.580
embracing that
kind of clunkiness

00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:54.996
and saying oh,
that's what's going

00:29:54.996 --> 00:29:57.700
to set my brand-- differentiate
my brand, rather than me trying

00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:00.155
to parrot and be
a "me too" version

00:30:00.155 --> 00:30:02.090
of someone else's brand.

00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:05.080
Well, you're into polo
from Slick Rick days.

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:08.040
That was the gold standard.

00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:09.650
ROB KENNER: Polo cologne too.

00:30:09.650 --> 00:30:10.350
Aw man.

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:12.030
MARC ECKO: Yeah, man.

00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:15.380
ROB KENNER: So let's talk
about complex real quick.

00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:20.110
We have some of the complex
oh jeez in the building,

00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:22.427
shout to Brendan,
Jack and Donnie.

00:30:22.427 --> 00:30:24.010
ROB KENNER: Thank
you guys for coming.

00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:26.641
And we roll deep
today, but I mentioned

00:30:26.641 --> 00:30:28.390
those three in particular
because you guys

00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:34.010
remember when Complex decided
to do this crazy website thing.

00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:39.420
At the time, print media was
the shit and doing website

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:42.060
was this other thing
that you did on the side.

00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:44.560
And, I think,
Brendan, at one point,

00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:46.490
you expressed doubt
whether it would ever

00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:49.060
reach a million page views.

00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:51.140
So anyway now it's
depending when

00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:54.280
you check [INAUDIBLE]
up among the top 200

00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:57.020
sites on the whole internet.

00:30:57.020 --> 00:31:01.452
Tell us why people told
you Complex was a bad idea.

00:31:01.452 --> 00:31:06.110
MARC ECKO: Well, because
I make sweatshirts, right?

00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:09.440
Because you're supposed
to like stay in your lane.

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:15.600
And the desire to create
it came from a place

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:20.530
where I as a buyer of media
and as this guy who came up

00:31:20.530 --> 00:31:25.960
in that '80s diaspora,
and kind of watching

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:29.560
the mainstreaming of hip
pop and its influence

00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:33.400
to kind of like have this
convergence thing happen.

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:35.660
In the late '80s, it
was crossing over.

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:38.820
Come the mid late '90s, people
are like oh, it's convergence.

00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:43.000
They started looking at
it this way obliquely.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.070
But as a media buyer,
I would get frustrated

00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:50.720
because if I wanted to kind of
make a presentation in men's

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:53.920
fashion or do like
a better ware thing.

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:58.180
It was hard to get convincingly
the edit community at GQ

00:31:58.180 --> 00:31:59.870
to take that stuff seriously.

00:31:59.870 --> 00:32:02.010
They would take your
dollars but the advertising

00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:06.570
and because of their kind of
disposition and their view,

00:32:06.570 --> 00:32:08.399
the cultural view on streetwear.

00:32:08.399 --> 00:32:10.190
They were like eh, it's
not really fashion,

00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:12.800
but where was I going to launch
like the Mark Echo brand?

00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:14.620
I had to put-- like
you'd would launch

00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:16.800
your media-bought dollars
there, because that's

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:19.240
where men's fashion
goes-- "Details," "GQ."

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:23.690
Same thing for music, if I
wanted to do like alternative

00:32:23.690 --> 00:32:27.870
or at the time my European
distributors were into this

00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:30.029
thing that was called,
at the time-- I mean,

00:32:30.029 --> 00:32:31.570
I don't know that
they called it EDM,

00:32:31.570 --> 00:32:33.440
but it was like early
EDM-- like you'd be in--

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:34.190
ROB KENNER: House.

00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:37.610
MARC ECKO: Yeah, like
you'd be in "ERB Magazine."

00:32:37.610 --> 00:32:39.940
And then if you're hip hop,
you're like the "Source,"

00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:42.070
and if you're skate,
you're "Thrasher."

00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:45.350
So the idea was that
I just saw, maybe

00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:48.019
in a slightly deluded
state, that there

00:32:48.019 --> 00:32:49.560
were these
inefficiencies, and then I

00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:52.010
saw this convergence thing
happening, that things were not

00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:57.530
just black or white, just hip
hop or alternative or rock

00:32:57.530 --> 00:32:58.580
or just high and low.

00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:00.189
They were complex.

00:33:00.189 --> 00:33:01.980
ROB KENNER: You unlabeled
media, basically.

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:05.020
MARC ECKO: Yeah, well,
I mean, now at 41

00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:06.770
with the book behind
me, I could say that,

00:33:06.770 --> 00:33:08.760
but I didn't think
that at the time.

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:10.870
I just was like a
little bit like wow,

00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:12.730
I'm looking at my media spend.

00:33:12.730 --> 00:33:14.120
Our business is growing.

00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:16.290
As a percentage
of revenue, you're

00:33:16.290 --> 00:33:18.260
starting to buy some
serious media dollars.

00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:19.750
You're like fuck,
we could do this.

00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:21.590
We can make a
business out of this,

00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:28.540
rather than just inefficiently
buy media, and then maybe

00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:31.470
hopefully solve something
for the rest of the space,

00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:34.990
and help verify and
validate the space, which

00:33:34.990 --> 00:33:40.150
is a lot of entrepreneurs
that came up within the skate

00:33:40.150 --> 00:33:43.790
and street scene have
helped kind of legitimize

00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:47.460
as a community our
business practices

00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:51.850
and create scale for
us as an ecosystem.

00:33:51.850 --> 00:33:54.770
So to Rich Antoniello's
credit, who's

00:33:54.770 --> 00:33:57.210
my partner and
CEO of Complex, it

00:33:57.210 --> 00:34:00.340
was really his
leadership in 2007,

00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:02.800
which was not an
easy year financially

00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:05.490
for the Echo business
certainly, and the way

00:34:05.490 --> 00:34:07.330
we had the businesses
configured at the time

00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:12.070
is that even though Complex
was pointing north from just

00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:14.320
bringing-- he actually
delivered immediate--

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:17.409
that print thing in the
black, which is kind of rare.

00:34:17.409 --> 00:34:20.530
It's kind of crazy to think you
could make print at that time

00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:23.050
profitable.

00:34:23.050 --> 00:34:25.460
But his dependency
on our financing

00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:28.820
was all contingent on how well
or not well, the Echo business

00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:29.320
was doing.

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:32.699
So we had him on-- I mean, two
nickels, rubbing two nickels,

00:34:32.699 --> 00:34:34.610
making fireworks thing.

00:34:34.610 --> 00:34:38.409
And really it was
his leadership that

00:34:38.409 --> 00:34:43.540
productized and visualized
the online play.

00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:46.659
And he just was a very
analog kind of perspective.

00:34:46.659 --> 00:34:50.389
It was like, look, I've got all
these ad sales executives who

00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:56.020
are really qualified, but I
can't keep up with their costs

00:34:56.020 --> 00:35:00.170
on 330 circ print product.

00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:02.010
The math wasn't lining up.

00:35:02.010 --> 00:35:06.160
So we naively, for better
or worse and iteratively

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:07.300
jumped in.

00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:13.330
So we were very fortunate being
and believing in this concept

00:35:13.330 --> 00:35:16.140
at the right time,
right place as well.

00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:20.240
ROB KENNER: But it wasn't only
Rich's vision and his business

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:22.659
acumen, but also his wrestling
skills that came into play,

00:35:22.659 --> 00:35:23.200
I understand.

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:25.570
MARC ECKO: Yeah, oh
yeah, his physicality

00:35:25.570 --> 00:35:28.364
to basically coerce
people physically.

00:35:28.364 --> 00:35:29.780
ROB KENNER: I mean,
I'm thinking--

00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:30.520
MARC ECKO: It's all in the book.

00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:31.770
It's on page 184, I think.

00:35:31.770 --> 00:35:32.330
I'm kidding.

00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:34.454
ROB KENNER: I'm thinking
of a particular individual

00:35:34.454 --> 00:35:36.200
that he coerced.

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:38.960
MARC ECKO: Oh yeah, my
former partner Seth.

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:42.546
They had to physically wrestle
it out in order to get--

00:35:42.546 --> 00:35:43.920
ROB KENNER: A
budget negotiation.

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:45.270
MARC ECKO: Yeah, a budget.

00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:47.480
There was a physical match.

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:49.260
ROB KENNER: And may
the best man win.

00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:52.720
MARC ECKO: Seth really thought
he was going to have him.

00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:56.440
But yeah, to his credit
and then the teams.

00:35:56.440 --> 00:36:02.090
And it's just been amazing
platform that's been built

00:36:02.090 --> 00:36:06.010
and a lot of really
intelligent and creative folks.

00:36:06.010 --> 00:36:09.470
And I'm very blessed
to be a part of it.

00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:12.790
ROB KENNER: Another of
my favorite anecdotes

00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:16.940
in the book, and just in terms
of taking a difficult situation

00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:20.110
and flipping it, is
the whole Where's

00:36:20.110 --> 00:36:24.890
Echo nontrade show
that turned Vegas

00:36:24.890 --> 00:36:27.190
upside down during
Magic Weekend.

00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:29.370
Can you just give a
little bit of the genesis

00:36:29.370 --> 00:36:30.410
of how that came about.

00:36:30.410 --> 00:36:33.600
MARC ECKO: That also
spoke in the framework

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:36.630
to that kind of the whole notion
of range of emotional impact,

00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:37.950
right?

00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:41.140
Here we were at a place
where we're really

00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:43.449
on the balls of our
ass financially.

00:36:43.449 --> 00:36:44.990
ROB KENNER: On the
balls of your ass?

00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:47.281
MARC ECKO: You know like the
flattest part of your ass,

00:36:47.281 --> 00:36:49.090
when you stretch your legs.

00:36:49.090 --> 00:36:50.980
And like the part
that if you sit on it,

00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:53.920
like there's no flesh there?

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:55.210
You really got to--

00:36:55.210 --> 00:36:55.970
ROB KENNER: Ouch.

00:36:55.970 --> 00:36:56.710
MARC ECKO: Yeah.

00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:57.870
So it hurts, right?

00:36:57.870 --> 00:37:03.490
So we were financially
in a pickle.

00:37:03.490 --> 00:37:06.030
That's in the book,
how we got there.

00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:11.790
We kind of self-made
a kind of self-wound.

00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:14.490
But we were at a place
where the cost of the trade

00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:17.850
shows and the optionality
of funding those trade shows

00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:19.350
just was not an option.

00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:23.280
But the irony at
that time is that we

00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:25.530
had a massive pull
in the market.

00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:29.120
So like from a
supply/demand business,

00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:32.100
like the demand side was high.

00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:36.560
And we couldn't afford
to fund the trade show.

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:40.880
So we'd bought the space,
so we leased the space

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:43.275
with the folks that
managed those conventions.

00:37:43.275 --> 00:37:44.425
This was in Las Vegas.

00:37:44.425 --> 00:37:48.437
It's like an industry--
the American big sportswear

00:37:48.437 --> 00:37:49.270
industry trade show.

00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:51.400
It's called Magic.

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:55.000
And so we were already on the
hook for whatever that was.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.500
But the notion of
having to fund the booth

00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:01.180
and shipping all the staff,
that option wasn't great.

00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:08.170
So we ran an audible and
we said, OK, let's just

00:38:08.170 --> 00:38:10.420
ask the industry where's Echo?

00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:11.610
So we own the booth.

00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:17.020
So our set up costs will just be
the rental fee of a red velvet

00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:20.910
rope going around the perimeter
of this oversized gargantuan

00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:22.790
booth that we really
couldn't afford.

00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:25.890
And that's one of the
reasons we were in debt.

00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:28.170
And in the middle,
there'd be a table,

00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:30.580
and there'd be a little
tea stand or whatever,

00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:32.710
and it would say "Where's
Echo," and then we

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:37.640
proceed to run up a
risk assessment of what

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:40.379
it would cost to basically
bomb Vegas with stickers

00:38:40.379 --> 00:38:42.045
and we paste posters
and like cardboard,

00:38:42.045 --> 00:38:43.640
real like Wu-Tang style.

00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:47.300
We just got up
everywhere in Vegas.

00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:52.470
And we took a suite
at whatever hotel,

00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:55.560
something decent
but modest budget.

00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:57.950
And that's where we
did our bookings from.

00:38:57.950 --> 00:39:01.640
And we ended up booking more
at that show-- our nonshow--

00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:04.785
than we had ever in the
history of the trade

00:39:04.785 --> 00:39:05.700
shows at that time.

00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:07.600
ROB KENNER: But the first day
was looking a little grim.

00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:08.850
MARC ECKO: It is looking grim.

00:39:08.850 --> 00:39:11.150
And it turned around,
it all turned around.

00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:13.430
And it informed our
view just generally

00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:15.890
on how to then-- cause
after you did that show,

00:39:15.890 --> 00:39:17.770
you're like we can't come back.

00:39:17.770 --> 00:39:20.500
You can't be like fuck you Magic
and then come back and then

00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:22.650
be like "we're back!"

00:39:22.650 --> 00:39:27.690
So we found one of
their Achilles heels,

00:39:27.690 --> 00:39:30.790
which was right across the
street from the convention

00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:35.120
center , there's this really--
it's kind of-- I don't want

00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:39.170
to say anything
disparaging-- and it's a bar,

00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:42.800
and we rented the
parking lot of that bar.

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:45.840
And we put up what we call the
middle finger pavilion, which

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:48.310
was like right in the line
of sight of the trade show

00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:52.290
and walking distance, so
we end up doing our trade

00:39:52.290 --> 00:39:54.225
shows outside of the trade show.

00:39:54.225 --> 00:39:55.850
ROB KENNER: The middle
finger pavilion.

00:39:55.850 --> 00:39:57.474
MARC ECKO: Yeah, that
was the nickname.

00:39:57.474 --> 00:39:58.660
Yeah.

00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:01.690
ROB KENNER: That's
just remarkable.

00:40:01.690 --> 00:40:03.090
Are we getting the signal?

00:40:03.090 --> 00:40:05.180
OK, well, this seems
like a great time

00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:11.750
to turn the microphones over
to those who are in attendance.

00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:14.930
I know that you want to know
more about the middle finger

00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:19.070
pavilion or where exactly
the balls of the ass

00:40:19.070 --> 00:40:20.620
is or anything else like that.

00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:24.310
No, but please, if you have
questions, the mic is open.

00:40:24.310 --> 00:40:25.360
Don't be shy.

00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:27.240
Step up.

00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:31.830
You don't need a swag
bomb to get this audience.

00:40:31.830 --> 00:40:32.910
Yes, here we go.

00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:33.310
MARC ECKO: All right.

00:40:33.310 --> 00:40:34.030
Someone will ask a question.

00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:35.130
ROB KENNER: We got a live one.

00:40:35.130 --> 00:40:36.780
AUDIENCE: How did you
get your [INAUDIBLE]?

00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:38.155
ROB KENNER: Oh
wait, see, you got

00:40:38.155 --> 00:40:39.960
to stand up and come
to the mic for that.

00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:42.167
She moved first, so you're next.

00:40:42.167 --> 00:40:43.250
MARC ECKO: Go ahead, dude.

00:40:43.250 --> 00:40:43.630
Go ahead.

00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:44.590
ROB KENNER: No, no, you first.

00:40:44.590 --> 00:40:44.900
Go.

00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:46.670
AUDIENCE: I win, Hi,
my name's Mahallat

00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:48.239
and I'm a big Complex fan.

00:40:48.239 --> 00:40:50.030
So I guess since there's
a lot of you guys,

00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:51.647
this can be for everybody.

00:40:51.647 --> 00:40:53.730
A friend of mine recently,
we got into an argument

00:40:53.730 --> 00:40:57.380
because he said that Complex
is for men in the same way

00:40:57.380 --> 00:40:59.620
that BuzzFeed is
strictly for women.

00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:02.330
And I disagree, because
I read Complex every day.

00:41:02.330 --> 00:41:03.910
I don't read BuzzFeed everyday.

00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:05.902
And obviously the
articles are better.

00:41:05.902 --> 00:41:08.110
So I wanted to know what
you guys thought about that.

00:41:08.110 --> 00:41:10.754
ROB KENNER: Very
perceptive reader.

00:41:10.754 --> 00:41:13.212
MARC ECKO: We think that you're
right that the articles are

00:41:13.212 --> 00:41:14.315
better.

00:41:14.315 --> 00:41:16.430
AUDIENCE: Just if
you guys purposely--

00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:19.127
there's some articles
obviously I can't get with,

00:41:19.127 --> 00:41:20.710
like all the men's
fashion, obviously,

00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:21.835
isn't going to work for me.

00:41:21.835 --> 00:41:23.650
So I thought, just
curious, if there

00:41:23.650 --> 00:41:26.660
were plans on
expanding more for--

00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:27.410
ROB KENNER: Women?

00:41:27.410 --> 00:41:28.830
AUDIENCE: --women
in that fashion,

00:41:28.830 --> 00:41:31.121
or if you guys think of it
like a primarily male brand,

00:41:31.121 --> 00:41:34.760
and just what you guys
think about that overall.

00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:37.570
MARC ECKO: I think, I
can't speak for everyone,

00:41:37.570 --> 00:41:40.880
but I could probably-- I
think the consensus internally

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:44.830
is that we do what
we do really well.

00:41:44.830 --> 00:41:48.950
And our disposition
is to serve and try

00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:52.380
to delight this young
male demographic.

00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:56.020
We do know that
there is a crossover,

00:41:56.020 --> 00:41:59.100
because a lot of the cultural
conversations are broad.

00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:05.220
But our framework
is when we paint

00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:09.250
a picture of the archetype,
we are focused mostly

00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:12.050
just on men for right now.

00:42:12.050 --> 00:42:13.780
I think though,
like I said, there's

00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:16.370
a lot of these conversations
that are generally broad,

00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:17.744
and there are a
lot of women that

00:42:17.744 --> 00:42:20.150
work inside the company that
actually inform the edit.

00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:27.987
So you're seeing their tone and
vibe come through the content.

00:42:27.987 --> 00:42:28.612
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:42:28.612 --> 00:42:29.910
Thank you.

00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:33.721
MARC ECKO: And for now, it's
I think a platform for dudes.

00:42:33.721 --> 00:42:35.095
ROB KENNER: And
guys read "Cosmo"

00:42:35.095 --> 00:42:38.920
to get intel on the other side.

00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:40.422
Probably works both ways.

00:42:40.422 --> 00:42:41.630
Now, you had a good question.

00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:43.000
Please come to the mic.

00:42:48.990 --> 00:42:51.199
AUDIENCE: How did you
originally get backing behind--

00:42:51.199 --> 00:42:52.406
MARC ECKO: Financial backing?

00:42:52.406 --> 00:42:53.760
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:57.140
MARC ECKO: I talk about it in
the book, which again speaks

00:42:57.140 --> 00:42:59.400
to the whole subtext
of perception, reality,

00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:04.970
because my perception was that
I'd been servicing and creating

00:43:04.970 --> 00:43:09.040
relationships with a lot
of celebrities at the time.

00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:11.080
And I presumed like
that celebrity there,

00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:16.610
X, like in this one instance-- I
don't know if you guys remember

00:43:16.610 --> 00:43:18.800
a group called Bell
Biv Devoe They're

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:20.222
derivative from New Edition.

00:43:20.222 --> 00:43:21.930
There's a guy named
Michael Bivins, who's

00:43:21.930 --> 00:43:27.200
a real entrepreneurial cat,
very successful music producer.

00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:29.120
I actually was air
brushing for him

00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:31.890
and actually managed
to get my friend,

00:43:31.890 --> 00:43:33.750
Cale Brock, who's
mentioned in the book,

00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:36.830
signed to his record label
through that interaction.

00:43:36.830 --> 00:43:40.640
So I was going down the rabbit
hole of meeting music execs,

00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:42.700
and I just perceived--
I perceived, well,

00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:43.970
they have money.

00:43:43.970 --> 00:43:44.970
Look at the videos.

00:43:44.970 --> 00:43:46.340
Look at their influence.

00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:50.270
So I kept beating
pounding the drum.

00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:52.420
If it was Spike Lee,
soliciting Spike Lee,

00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:55.050
soliciting Biv, soliciting
a whole bunch of people

00:43:55.050 --> 00:43:57.690
that were just specifically
music industry.

00:43:57.690 --> 00:44:00.330
And what ended up
happening is one

00:44:00.330 --> 00:44:04.740
of those unsuspecting
characters, who didn't look

00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:08.320
and dress the part of
celebrity, became my partner,

00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:12.400
a guy named Seth Gerszberg, who
literally put the first $5,000

00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:13.450
into the company.

00:44:13.450 --> 00:44:18.290
And he kind of was my
commercialization beast.

00:44:18.290 --> 00:44:22.260
As a band goes, the composition
of the original company

00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:26.650
was my twin sister Marci, who
I talk about this in the book.

00:44:26.650 --> 00:44:27.980
She was like governance.

00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:31.690
Like she governed, kept the
boys from killing each other.

00:44:31.690 --> 00:44:34.350
And then there was
my partner Seth

00:44:34.350 --> 00:44:37.250
who was like the brute force
and the commercialization.

00:44:37.250 --> 00:44:39.650
And I was kind of like the
swag and the branded and kind

00:44:39.650 --> 00:44:42.960
of the emotional
part of the equation.

00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:47.390
But in tandem, we went out
there and kind of slowly

00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:50.350
from that initial
$5,000 investment,

00:44:50.350 --> 00:44:53.887
he managed to
coerce another group

00:44:53.887 --> 00:44:55.220
that he was doing business with.

00:44:55.220 --> 00:44:56.980
I talk about it in the book.

00:44:56.980 --> 00:44:58.830
And they were our
initial seed investors.

00:44:58.830 --> 00:45:02.470
And we eventually
bought them out.

00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:06.060
But it's not an easy--
getting funding,

00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:09.356
that's the trick
question, right?

00:45:09.356 --> 00:45:12.360
Or that's the $25,000 question.

00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:14.430
No pun intended, or
pun maybe intended.

00:45:14.430 --> 00:45:21.410
But there's no single one
way to do it obviously.

00:45:21.410 --> 00:45:23.370
And what's so fascinating
today with what's

00:45:23.370 --> 00:45:26.880
going on culturally with
like platforms like Indigogo

00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:30.970
or Kickstarter and a lower
path, a lower threshold,

00:45:30.970 --> 00:45:32.680
because of Google,
the fact you could

00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:34.680
kind of, from Google
or not, just directly

00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:38.520
go to Ali Baba or wherever and
source things domestically,

00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:39.600
oversees.

00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:42.310
The barrier to enter,
if you want to learn,

00:45:42.310 --> 00:45:45.180
if there's a wantedness,
is sufficiently lower.

00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:46.980
But it's that much noisier now.

00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:49.790
So that's why branding
is a really crucial part

00:45:49.790 --> 00:45:50.992
of the equation.

00:45:50.992 --> 00:45:51.700
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:52.450
MARC ECKO: Cheers.

00:45:57.714 --> 00:45:58.880
AUDIENCE: My name's Kennedy.

00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:00.870
I appreciate you
coming out today.

00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:04.530
My question is did you ever
feel lost on this journey.

00:46:04.530 --> 00:46:06.880
I imagine that a lot
of entrepreneurs, they

00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:08.880
feel like they're the
only one in the world that

00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:12.350
feels a certain way, and
clearly had that drive

00:46:12.350 --> 00:46:13.850
to keep you going.

00:46:13.850 --> 00:46:15.330
How do you keep
yourself focused,

00:46:15.330 --> 00:46:17.610
or did you have a
mentor that said

00:46:17.610 --> 00:46:20.254
you know what, just shut
up and keep on doing it.

00:46:20.254 --> 00:46:21.920
Did you have anything
sort of like that?

00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:24.150
MARC ECKO: Yeah, I think
that there's a couple things

00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:27.340
that if you took them
away from me in my life

00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:32.570
that I probably really
be well below average.

00:46:32.570 --> 00:46:37.010
One is having grown up in
Lakewood, New Jersey, which

00:46:37.010 --> 00:46:44.700
was a very diverse place,
and at a time where

00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:46.260
hip hop was emerging.

00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:50.170
So the lens in which
I view the world

00:46:50.170 --> 00:46:53.010
is viewed through
that lens of Lakewood.

00:46:53.010 --> 00:46:55.070
So that gives me a
very different kind

00:46:55.070 --> 00:46:57.530
of cultural view on stuff.

00:46:57.530 --> 00:46:58.130
So that's one.

00:46:58.130 --> 00:47:01.992
Two is I've a twin sister.

00:47:01.992 --> 00:47:03.450
And everything they
say about twins

00:47:03.450 --> 00:47:08.100
is true in terms of best
friend and all that.

00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:10.220
So, if you were to
take Marci, and she's

00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:12.070
as a character
throughout the book,

00:47:12.070 --> 00:47:14.460
I describe her as
my ghost of reason.

00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:18.570
So in a lot of ways, I had
this really interesting yin

00:47:18.570 --> 00:47:26.450
to my yang, who's someone
who's not a visual artist.

00:47:26.450 --> 00:47:29.260
She doesn't need
the fanfare, maybe

00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:31.330
in the way that I'm
more of a narcissistic.

00:47:31.330 --> 00:47:35.270
So I had that throughout
my adolescence

00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:37.720
and then in my career,
and to this day,

00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:40.700
where I still work with
Marci very closely,

00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:44.170
that served me in a way
that I can't contemplate

00:47:44.170 --> 00:47:46.680
life or business without that.

00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:52.149
And my relationship with
mentors had been-- it's

00:47:52.149 --> 00:47:53.690
funny because I
think a lot of people

00:47:53.690 --> 00:47:55.856
prescribe to that idea of
(PATHETIC VOICE) "will you

00:47:55.856 --> 00:47:56.540
be my mentor?"

00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:59.000
And they kind of think of
them like their shrink.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.250
And they meet with them
once every three weeks

00:48:01.250 --> 00:48:02.290
at the coffee shop.

00:48:02.290 --> 00:48:04.590
And it's kind of
like consistent,

00:48:04.590 --> 00:48:07.490
mostly inconsistent,
but at parties,

00:48:07.490 --> 00:48:08.940
"I want you to meet my mentor."

00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:11.380
I imagine that works.

00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:13.160
I know people that
that's worked for.

00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:16.740
But I found that when there's
a wantedness to learn,

00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:17.830
their learning comes.

00:48:17.830 --> 00:48:19.460
It's there to be gleaned.

00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:21.670
And that you could have
mentor-like relationships

00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:24.420
in the most unsuspecting
places and in a manner that

00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:27.580
doesn't necessarily consume
their schedule on that kind

00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:30.930
of road every two three
weeks kind of a way.

00:48:30.930 --> 00:48:33.920
But alone, yeah, of course.

00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:37.820
I mean, I'm human, right?

00:48:37.820 --> 00:48:40.800
But there's nothing--
I hate to break it

00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:43.530
to myself or to any
entrepreneur, like we're not

00:48:43.530 --> 00:48:45.010
unique in feeling alone.

00:48:45.010 --> 00:48:48.000
It's like welcome to trying
to do shit differently.

00:48:52.702 --> 00:48:55.660
Again, that is, again, a subtext
of the book-- this relationship

00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:57.710
of goal keepers
versus gatekeepers.

00:48:57.710 --> 00:49:00.590
The goal keepers, being
ultimately who you're building,

00:49:00.590 --> 00:49:03.520
trying to execute your vision
for and the gatekeepers,

00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:07.350
being those that guard, kind
of the influencers, the media,

00:49:07.350 --> 00:49:11.212
maybe a buyer, could be a dean
or an academic relationship.

00:49:11.212 --> 00:49:12.670
But those gatekeeper
relationships,

00:49:12.670 --> 00:49:16.750
so much of what we often do,
we want consent from them.

00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:19.810
We want to comply to their
standard and there's a want,

00:49:19.810 --> 00:49:21.780
a cultural wantedness.

00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:24.660
And I would challenge
today, more than ever,

00:49:24.660 --> 00:49:26.710
that you've to be
very cognizant and ask

00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:29.810
yourself are you not
inadvertently building

00:49:29.810 --> 00:49:32.100
your product or service
for the wrong audience,

00:49:32.100 --> 00:49:33.570
versus having a
real intellectually

00:49:33.570 --> 00:49:39.000
honest conversation around
who the goal keeper is,

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:40.880
who at the consumer
level is really--

00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:44.170
and what do they really
need to kind of be contented

00:49:44.170 --> 00:49:49.230
and to judge you as either
executing or not executing.

00:49:49.230 --> 00:49:51.750
Because often you have that
social pressure that's here,

00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:55.120
and doesn't have shit to
do with your core business.

00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:57.200
And in fashion, I've
seen way too many

00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:59.650
designers-- people
way smarter than me,

00:49:59.650 --> 00:50:02.860
more talented, more creative,
build their business there,

00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:05.540
and then end up with a
business that's not relevant.

00:50:05.540 --> 00:50:08.190
There's disconnected
from a consumer,

00:50:08.190 --> 00:50:10.130
like a real-- at scale.

00:50:10.130 --> 00:50:13.560
So that's how I'd answer that.

00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:16.540
ROB KENNER: So the gatekeepers
really aren't as important

00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:17.825
as they think they are.

00:50:17.825 --> 00:50:21.710
MARC ECKO: Oh, again, it comes
from that 12-year sentence

00:50:21.710 --> 00:50:22.970
that we all had to go through.

00:50:22.970 --> 00:50:23.470
Right?

00:50:23.470 --> 00:50:25.770
We all wanted the gold star.

00:50:25.770 --> 00:50:29.420
We're taught, but in a
self-directed, self-taught

00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:33.650
pursuit, which is really the
only path of entrepreneurship.

00:50:33.650 --> 00:50:37.120
It's like your greatest learning
kind of comes on some wax

00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:38.550
on, wax off shit.

00:50:38.550 --> 00:50:41.140
You have to be added, right?

00:50:41.140 --> 00:50:43.435
And you want that guidance,
you want that governance,

00:50:43.435 --> 00:50:47.380
so that you're not just
wandering in the dark.

00:50:47.380 --> 00:50:50.700
But to think that you have to
create the evidence of what's

00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:53.060
good or complying, and
there's that standard,

00:50:53.060 --> 00:50:55.220
like the way that we're
taught, K through 12,

00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:56.990
and that's how it works
in the real world.

00:50:56.990 --> 00:50:59.800
It's really quite not like that.

00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:03.630
And we get very
romantic, especially

00:51:03.630 --> 00:51:06.740
in the big cities,
west coast, east coast,

00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:10.910
living in these kind of
bubbles of gatekeeper-dominated

00:51:10.910 --> 00:51:12.920
conversations.

00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:17.180
And that's definitely
something that I've

00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:21.520
learned to kind of be a little
more flip about and not where

00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:24.240
you're out there
in fantasy land,

00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:29.960
with this fantasy version of out
wandering, inside joke style.

00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:35.240
But I think that we give too
much credence-- in culture

00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:40.420
we're at a place where our
university system don't work.

00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:41.480
They don't work.

00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:44.390
OK, like our education
really fucked and fucked.

00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:46.360
What we need is like
Google or someone

00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:48.280
like that smart
to figure it out.

00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:51.930
Because we're all chasing
like this big oil approach

00:51:51.930 --> 00:51:53.569
that's all gatekeeper dependent.

00:51:53.569 --> 00:51:55.110
And that's not really
how we're going

00:51:55.110 --> 00:51:57.780
to end up being independent
in the real world

00:51:57.780 --> 00:52:00.400
or financially independent.

00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:03.616
So that's a real cultural issue.

00:52:03.616 --> 00:52:06.180
ROB KENNER: We're getting
the timeout signal.

00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:08.800
My man Jacob.

00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:09.490
Thanks, Marc.

00:52:09.490 --> 00:52:10.365
MARC ECKO: Thank you.

00:52:10.365 --> 00:52:11.430
Thank you all for coming.

00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:13.054
AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]

00:52:13.054 --> 00:52:14.220
MARC ECKO: Thanks to Google.

00:52:17.010 --> 00:52:19.730
ROB KENNER: And thanks to Google
for gChat and Google Docs,

00:52:19.730 --> 00:52:22.080
which is how we run in the
Complex and OG Chat which

00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:25.200
is their new product,
coming out of Google labs.

00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:26.320
This is the OG Chat.

00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:27.028
MARC ECKO: Right.

00:52:27.028 --> 00:52:29.798
We're the engineers
on that product.

00:52:29.798 --> 00:52:31.022
OG chat.

00:52:31.022 --> 00:52:33.400
It's very cool.

00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:34.140
It's a big thing.

00:52:34.140 --> 00:52:35.530
ROB KENNER: And there's
books in the back, right?

00:52:35.530 --> 00:52:36.045
MARC ECKO: Yeah, man.

00:52:36.045 --> 00:52:36.300
ROB KENNER: All right.

00:52:36.300 --> 00:52:36.600
MARC ECKO: Cheers.

00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:37.266
Thanks, brother.

00:52:37.266 --> 00:52:38.750
Cheers.
