00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:02.495
- [Instructor] In other
videos we talk about the rapid

00:00:02.495 --> 00:00:05.388
spread of Islam, and one
of the interesting things

00:00:05.388 --> 00:00:08.419
about these early Islamic empires

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:11.376
is they preserved much
of what they inherited

00:00:11.376 --> 00:00:14.926
from the Byzantine and
the Persian empires.

00:00:14.926 --> 00:00:17.704
The infrastructure including the roads,

00:00:17.704 --> 00:00:19.183
the bureaucracy.

00:00:19.183 --> 00:00:21.011
A lot of the culture.

00:00:21.011 --> 00:00:24.899
And they also began to
collect the knowledge

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:27.658
from within the empire
and from the peoples

00:00:27.658 --> 00:00:29.905
that they encountered on
the borders of the empire

00:00:29.905 --> 00:00:33.474
including the Indians, and the Chinese.

00:00:33.474 --> 00:00:36.577
And they did this throughout
the Umayyad dynasty.

00:00:36.577 --> 00:00:39.859
But it really came to its full fruition

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:42.276
during the Abbasid Caliphate.

00:00:43.433 --> 00:00:46.101
Now the Abbasid Caliphate,
one of the first things

00:00:46.101 --> 00:00:49.686
they did under the Calph al-Mansur

00:00:49.686 --> 00:00:54.528
is build Baghdad and move
the capital of the empire

00:00:54.528 --> 00:00:55.824
to Baghdad.

00:00:55.824 --> 00:00:58.742
Now one of al-Mansur's successors

00:00:58.742 --> 00:01:01.992
al-Rashid, is famous for making Baghdad

00:01:02.917 --> 00:01:05.069
a center of learning.

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:09.393
According to the historian
John William Draper

00:01:09.393 --> 00:01:12.042
this is a sense of what life was like

00:01:12.042 --> 00:01:14.005
under al-Rashid's rule.

00:01:14.005 --> 00:01:16.461
During the period of the
Calphs the learned men

00:01:16.461 --> 00:01:18.305
of the Christians and
the Jews were not only

00:01:18.305 --> 00:01:20.901
held in great esteem, but were appointed

00:01:20.901 --> 00:01:22.660
to posts of great responsibilities

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.040
and were promoted to
the higher ranking jobs

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.053
in the government.

00:01:26.053 --> 00:01:29.080
He, Calph Haroon Rasheed, never considered

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.508
to which country alerted person belonged

00:01:31.508 --> 00:01:34.670
nor his faith in belief
but only his excellence

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.434
in the field of learning.

00:01:36.434 --> 00:01:39.243
And to get a sense of how much learning

00:01:39.243 --> 00:01:41.438
and how advanced the knowledge began to be

00:01:41.438 --> 00:01:43.938
especially under the rulership

00:01:44.773 --> 00:01:47.271
of al-Rashid, during this time

00:01:47.271 --> 00:01:49.810
he was a contemporary of Charlemagne

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.229
who was the Frankish king.

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.646
He was also the first holy Roman emperor.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.019
And so it's this region right over here.

00:01:59.019 --> 00:02:01.060
And they were trading gifts

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.461
and this is a historical account

00:02:04.461 --> 00:02:06.831
Haroon al-Rashid sends

00:02:06.831 --> 00:02:09.449
Charlemagne this water clock.

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:12.597
And it's so foreign to the Francs

00:02:12.597 --> 00:02:15.113
to Charlemagne, that he thinks that it's

00:02:15.113 --> 00:02:17.871
it must be some type of magic.

00:02:17.871 --> 00:02:21.101
That it can't be explained
by just normal means.

00:02:21.101 --> 00:02:25.274
And then things really
get invested in terms

00:02:25.274 --> 00:02:26.904
of collecting knowledge

00:02:26.904 --> 00:02:30.147
as we get into the rule of al-Rashid's son

00:02:30.147 --> 00:02:33.649
al-Ma'mun where he creates in Baghdad

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:36.078
what is called The House of Wisdom.

00:02:36.078 --> 00:02:38.501
Which is this center of learning,

00:02:38.501 --> 00:02:41.071
of mathematics, astronomy, physics,

00:02:41.071 --> 00:02:43.968
medicine, geography, and map making,

00:02:43.968 --> 00:02:45.897
poetry, philosophy.

00:02:45.897 --> 00:02:48.924
And, over the next several hundred years

00:02:48.924 --> 00:02:51.583
these Abbasid Caliphs are going to

00:02:51.583 --> 00:02:53.916
sponsor scholars from India,

00:02:54.935 --> 00:02:58.096
learn it in Sanskrit and
the ancient Sanskrit text

00:02:58.096 --> 00:03:01.064
in Greek, Chinese, Persian
to translate as much

00:03:01.064 --> 00:03:02.957
of the knowledge and to collect it

00:03:02.957 --> 00:03:05.764
in libraries in cities, like Baghdad.

00:03:05.764 --> 00:03:08.622
To translate it into
Arabic, and to collect all

00:03:08.622 --> 00:03:11.994
of that knowledge in one place.

00:03:11.994 --> 00:03:15.625
And just to get a sense
of the type of advances

00:03:15.625 --> 00:03:19.296
that occurred during
this golden age of Islam

00:03:19.296 --> 00:03:23.306
which correlates strongly,
or is essentially during

00:03:23.306 --> 00:03:26.866
the Abbasid dynasty and it
ends with the Mongol invasion

00:03:26.866 --> 00:03:30.197
in the middle of the 13th
century right over here.

00:03:30.197 --> 00:03:33.364
There are scientists like Al-Kwarizmi.

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.083
And Al-Kwarizmi is a Persian mathematician

00:03:39.083 --> 00:03:40.250
and physicist.

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:45.893
And he's famous for being
the father of algebra.

00:03:45.893 --> 00:03:48.365
The word algebra that we now have today

00:03:48.365 --> 00:03:51.826
the subject you can learn a
lot about on Khan Academy

00:03:51.826 --> 00:03:54.510
it comes from the Arabic word al-jabr

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.147
and his book al-Kitab al-mukhtasar

00:03:58.147 --> 00:03:59.480
fi hisab al-jabr

00:04:00.644 --> 00:04:01.956
wal-muqabala

00:04:01.956 --> 00:04:04.594
which literally means, and
those of you who might speak

00:04:04.594 --> 00:04:07.300
Arabic, or Persian, or even Hindi

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.751
or who might recognize Kitab as book.

00:04:09.751 --> 00:04:12.524
And then hisab is calculation.

00:04:12.524 --> 00:04:15.298
And al-jabr is an operation of completion

00:04:15.298 --> 00:04:17.710
and it's essentially it's
one of the operations

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:19.268
we now do in algebra where you're doing

00:04:19.268 --> 00:04:21.545
the same thing to both
sides of the equation

00:04:21.545 --> 00:04:25.362
Balancing is also a
very similar operation.

00:04:25.362 --> 00:04:28.848
He also brought the Indian number system

00:04:28.848 --> 00:04:30.468
or the Hindu numerals.

00:04:30.468 --> 00:04:33.635
He brought them to the Islamic empire.

00:04:34.574 --> 00:04:36.939
And that was really the
bridge to bringing it

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:38.385
to the west.

00:04:38.385 --> 00:04:41.276
Famously Pope Sylvester the second

00:04:41.276 --> 00:04:43.544
he was educated in Catalonia

00:04:43.544 --> 00:04:45.606
with the point of acquiring knowledge

00:04:45.606 --> 00:04:47.595
that was gained from the Arabs.

00:04:47.595 --> 00:04:49.616
Remember, the Arabs were in control

00:04:49.616 --> 00:04:51.248
over the Islamic empires.

00:04:51.248 --> 00:04:52.900
It was not the Abbasids

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.723
it was actually the
remnants of the Umayyads

00:04:54.723 --> 00:04:57.414
who were in control of Spain at the time.

00:04:57.414 --> 00:04:59.999
But because of that,
this area was considered

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:01.667
a center of learning.

00:05:01.667 --> 00:05:04.250
And Pope Sylvester, who
got his education there,

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.161
he's the one that is
often given credit for

00:05:08.161 --> 00:05:10.279
being one of the first to introduce the

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:11.737
decimal numeral system.

00:05:11.737 --> 00:05:14.451
This Hindu Arabic decimal system

00:05:14.451 --> 00:05:16.719
that we now use for our numeric system

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:19.845
as opposed to something
like Roman Numerals.

00:05:19.845 --> 00:05:22.056
Well another very
interesting thing is not only

00:05:22.056 --> 00:05:24.775
the word algebra comes from al-jabr

00:05:24.775 --> 00:05:27.466
but the word algorithm is literally

00:05:27.466 --> 00:05:29.316
comes from his name.

00:05:29.316 --> 00:05:33.156
The name Al-Kwarizmi, Al-Kwarizmi in Latin

00:05:33.156 --> 00:05:35.159
they pronounce as algarithme.

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:38.159
So other significant contributors to

00:05:39.028 --> 00:05:41.616
the science of all of human civilization

00:05:41.616 --> 00:05:44.423
are people like al-Marwazi.

00:05:44.423 --> 00:05:47.984
Al-Marwazi, once again, in Baghdad.

00:05:47.984 --> 00:05:51.249
And he would have been a contemporary

00:05:51.249 --> 00:05:52.499
of al-Kwarizmi.

00:05:53.474 --> 00:05:56.224
And he, if you've ever taken trigonometry,

00:05:56.224 --> 00:05:58.585
or if you're about to take trigonometry,

00:05:58.585 --> 00:06:01.662
he is accredited with coming up with

00:06:01.662 --> 00:06:03.535
the core trigonometric functions.

00:06:03.535 --> 00:06:06.028
We're talking about sine, cosine.

00:06:06.028 --> 00:06:07.550
Tangent and cotangent

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.541
it might have been Marwazi or it might

00:06:09.541 --> 00:06:12.460
have been another mathematician

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.543
named al-Buzjani who came

00:06:15.621 --> 00:06:17.477
a little bit after, or a lot

00:06:17.477 --> 00:06:19.069
depending on a human scale,

00:06:19.069 --> 00:06:22.211
but was also based in Baghdad.

00:06:22.211 --> 00:06:25.608
And together, they came up with the six

00:06:25.608 --> 00:06:27.247
the six trigonometric functions.

00:06:27.247 --> 00:06:28.544
They weren't contemporaries of each other

00:06:28.544 --> 00:06:31.108
but they both made
significant contributions

00:06:31.108 --> 00:06:33.863
to what we now call trigonometry.

00:06:33.863 --> 00:06:37.130
Including many of the
trigonometric identities

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:40.467
that we now learn in high school.

00:06:40.467 --> 00:06:44.268
Now you also have
physicists, mathematicians,

00:06:44.268 --> 00:06:45.561
astronomers,

00:06:45.561 --> 00:06:46.644
like Alhazon.

00:06:47.783 --> 00:06:50.722
And he is credited as
getting one of the more

00:06:50.722 --> 00:06:53.600
sophisticated views of how
light and vision works.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.907
These are some quotes from Alhazon.

00:06:55.907 --> 00:06:58.668
From each point of every
color body illuminated

00:06:58.668 --> 00:07:01.987
by any light issue light
and color along every

00:07:01.987 --> 00:07:04.253
straight line that can
be drawn from that point.

00:07:04.253 --> 00:07:06.633
This is a fairly sophisticated
view of how light

00:07:06.633 --> 00:07:07.755
actually works.

00:07:07.755 --> 00:07:11.814
And he's also credited with
using and understanding

00:07:11.814 --> 00:07:13.292
the scientific method

00:07:13.292 --> 00:07:16.819
several hundred years before
the Renaissance in Europe.

00:07:16.819 --> 00:07:19.840
The duty of a man, the duty
of the man who investigates

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.422
the writing of scientists.

00:07:21.422 --> 00:07:23.707
If learning the truth is his goal

00:07:23.707 --> 00:07:27.139
is to make himself an
enemy of all that he reads

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:29.462
and attack it from every side.

00:07:29.462 --> 00:07:31.955
He should also suspect
himself as he performs

00:07:31.955 --> 00:07:34.358
his critical examination of it

00:07:34.358 --> 00:07:38.050
so that he may avoid falling
into either prejudice

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:39.050
or leniency.

00:07:40.459 --> 00:07:43.703
And now another very
famous poet philosopher

00:07:43.703 --> 00:07:46.069
mathematician poly math of the time

00:07:46.069 --> 00:07:47.692
was Omar Khayyan.

00:07:47.692 --> 00:07:51.479
And in the west, he's most
famous for his poetry.

00:07:51.479 --> 00:07:53.932
Most famously the work of the Rubaiyat

00:07:53.932 --> 00:07:56.559
the translation by Fitzgerald.

00:07:56.559 --> 00:07:59.905
But he was also a significant philosopher

00:07:59.905 --> 00:08:01.256
mathematician.

00:08:01.256 --> 00:08:04.573
This is a picture of some
of his work right over here.

00:08:04.573 --> 00:08:06.753
You can see that he did
his work in the 11th

00:08:06.753 --> 00:08:08.707
and the 12th centuries.

00:08:08.707 --> 00:08:10.912
And he did it from (mumbling).

00:08:10.912 --> 00:08:14.402
But he investigated Pascal's Triangle

00:08:14.402 --> 00:08:15.826
and the binomial theorem.

00:08:15.826 --> 00:08:18.041
And keep in mind, this was over 500 years

00:08:18.041 --> 00:08:19.231
before Pascal.

00:08:19.231 --> 00:08:21.402
So maybe it should actually be called

00:08:21.402 --> 00:08:23.163
Khayyam's Triangle.

00:08:23.163 --> 00:08:25.320
And just to get a sense of
his poetry, or a sense of

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:27.949
the (mumbling) in general,
which I encourage you to

00:08:27.949 --> 00:08:28.937
look up and read.

00:08:28.937 --> 00:08:32.915
And this is at least
Fitzgerald's translation of it.

00:08:32.915 --> 00:08:35.527
And that inverted bowl we call the sky

00:08:35.527 --> 00:08:38.604
where under crawling
cooped we live and die.

00:08:38.604 --> 00:08:40.997
Lift not they hands to it for help

00:08:40.997 --> 00:08:43.164
for it rolls impotently on

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:45.383
as thou or I.

00:08:46.975 --> 00:08:50.646
So as you can imagine, this Islamic world

00:08:50.646 --> 00:08:53.912
these empires between the eighth

00:08:53.912 --> 00:08:56.584
and 13th centuries, it was
actually a very powerful

00:08:56.584 --> 00:08:58.322
bridge of human knowledge

00:08:58.322 --> 00:09:00.397
taking knowledge from
the Indians, the Chinese,

00:09:00.397 --> 00:09:02.736
the Ancient Greeks, and providing a bridge

00:09:02.736 --> 00:09:05.711
during the Dark Ages in Europe.

00:09:05.711 --> 00:09:08.230
And get a sense of that, we have some text

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:11.511
from some historians on that time period.

00:09:11.511 --> 00:09:13.986
This is some text from

00:09:13.986 --> 00:09:16.188
this is some text from

00:09:16.188 --> 00:09:18.656
the historian Phillip Hiti.

00:09:18.656 --> 00:09:20.370
And he wrote,

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:23.073
During all the first
part of the Middle Ages

00:09:23.073 --> 00:09:26.128
no other people made as
important a contribution

00:09:26.128 --> 00:09:28.669
to human progress as did the Arabs.

00:09:28.669 --> 00:09:31.111
If we take this term to mean all those

00:09:31.111 --> 00:09:33.246
whose mother tongue was Arabic

00:09:33.246 --> 00:09:36.449
and not merely those living
in the Arabian peninsula.

00:09:36.449 --> 00:09:39.465
For centuries, Arabic was
a language of learning,

00:09:39.465 --> 00:09:41.652
culture, and intellectual progress

00:09:41.652 --> 00:09:43.990
for the whole of the civilized world

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:46.206
with the exception of the Far East.

00:09:46.206 --> 00:09:49.125
From the ninth to the 12th
century, there were more

00:09:49.125 --> 00:09:51.959
philosophical medical historical religious

00:09:51.959 --> 00:09:54.271
astronomical and geographical works

00:09:54.271 --> 00:09:58.156
written in Arabic than in
any other human tongue.

00:09:58.156 --> 00:10:01.975
And we also have a frame,
a point of view from

00:10:01.975 --> 00:10:05.498
Bertrand Russell in his
History of Western Philosophy

00:10:05.498 --> 00:10:06.763
who wrote,

00:10:06.763 --> 00:10:09.584
Our use of the phrase the Dark Ages

00:10:09.584 --> 00:10:12.064
to cover the period from 699

00:10:12.064 --> 00:10:14.906
to 1000 marks our undue concentration

00:10:14.906 --> 00:10:16.377
on Western Europe.

00:10:16.377 --> 00:10:19.268
In China, this period
includes the time of the

00:10:19.268 --> 00:10:22.989
Tang dynasty, the greatest
age of Chinese poetry.

00:10:22.989 --> 00:10:25.638
From India to Spain, the
brilliant civilization

00:10:25.638 --> 00:10:27.096
of Islam flourished.

00:10:27.096 --> 00:10:29.796
What was lost to Christendom at this time

00:10:29.796 --> 00:10:34.228
was not lost to civilization,
but quite the contrary.

00:10:34.228 --> 00:10:37.922
To us it seems that Western
European civilization

00:10:37.922 --> 00:10:40.005
is civilization, but this

00:10:41.251 --> 00:10:42.668
is a narrow view.
