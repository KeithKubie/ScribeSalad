Speaker 1:          00:06          Like a boss. I didn't realize this, I guess like a year ago or two years ago. You know that actress Shelley Duvall, who crushed it in the shining?

Speaker 2:          00:19          Dammit. Let me open up God damn door.

Speaker 1:          00:24          Well, she's in her sixties now and I guess she's having, I don't know what she's having. She's having some sort of mental issue. I don't know what it is. Okay. But she's old and she needs medical help. That scumbag. Dr Phil, who I called it the second I saw that guy I called it I, I was at, that guy looks like a fucking crooked cop. The second I saw him, I was like, that guy looks like he planted a fucking gun on you. You know, he fucking shoot you over some routine fucking traffic stop. And He'd pull out. He do that to a white person. That's how fucking nuts this guy is, right. He's not your standard, you know, bad cop going after minorities. This guy would do it. This guy's like a see it as a serial killer look, doesn't he? Um, anyways, that piece of Shit fucking interviewed Shelley Duvall and talked to her is if he was trying to help her.

Speaker 2:          01:23          Okay. Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:42          And she was saying all of this stuff about how Robin Williams was still alive and fucking, you know, the earth is flat and just all kinds of stuff like that where it's clearly like, oh my God, all right, shut off the cameras, shut off the cameras, come on, let's not do this to her. And he's sitting there talking to her life. So like, he's going to try to help her. So like you think that a Robin Williams is still alive?

Speaker 1:          02:24          Okay. Um, I'll think you need, like he, he was acting the entire fucking time. Like he was trying to help her rather than completely exploiting this famous actress who's now in like, you know, this mental condition. It's just photos. It was, I don't, I don't, how do people, how do you still sit down and watch that guy's fucking show? Fuck that guy and everything. He's fucking connected to Jesus. You don't have enough fucking money. You can't, you don't drag enough fucking penniless people onto your fucking show. You don't have enough honey booboo, people coming on your fucking show. You got to do that. Jesus fucking Christ. But you know, I've been meditating and I guess I'm not supposed to get upset about this. I should really, you know, I should expect it. I should expect that behavior out of him. So you're saying that you're hearing these voices in your head are or [inaudible] I don't. I'm making up all of this shit. I couldn't get, I couldn't get,

Speaker 1:          03:34          I don't think I got 20 seconds. 30 seconds to do it the second she said the Robin Williams thing and then they cut to him. Go. So your, and once he did that I had to just so I shut it off. Shut it off, shut it off.

Speaker 3:          03:49          Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:02          You know what wouldn't you like? First of all, I love that people watch those shows is I is if they're like watching somebody trying to help somebody, they're not, you can't fix somebody in a half hour episode. Oh that time when he had that girl on that little girl on there, the a, you know, catch me. I'm sad how my dad, that one that went fucking viral

I just kept seeing it on Twitter and I was like, I have to see what that is. And I'm not gonna lie to you. I did watch it and I did enjoy it. So maybe I've got to knock back my criticisms. Criticism. Why don't you just exploit people that still have their whole life ahead of them. Jesus fucking Christ. I don't know. Did I become the asshole by the end of that? I don't remember. I don't again, I don't know where the fuck that whole thing went. Um,
