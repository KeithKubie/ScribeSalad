00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.086
So there's a couple of really nice things to be

00:00:02.086 --> 00:00:04.715
able to say about single-link clustering. So one of them

00:00:04.715 --> 00:00:08.319
is that it's deterministic, right? So we run the same

00:00:08.319 --> 00:00:11.625
algorithm, and unless there's ties in the distances, it, it will

00:00:11.625 --> 00:00:14.630
give us an answer, which is, which is nice. Doesn't

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.878
require any kind of randomized optimization. Another thing about it is

00:00:17.878 --> 00:00:21.990
that if you're doing this process in a space where

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.390
the distances represent edge lengths of the graph then this is

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.310
actually the same as a minimum spanning tree algorithm.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:29.330
&gt;&gt; Hm.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.080
&gt;&gt; And another nice property is that the running

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.740
time of the algorithm is actually relatively friendly and

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.060
can be characterized so let's, let's think that through.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.710
So let's imagine we've got n points or objects

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.530
that we want to cluster. And we've got K

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.700
clusters that we want as our as our target

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.050
at the end. Which of these different running times

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.940
best characterizes the running time of single link clustering?
