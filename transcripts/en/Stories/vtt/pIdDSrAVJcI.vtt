NARRATOR 1: This
is a simple image.

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:05.770
But as the saying goes, it
can speak a thousand words.

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.660
The man who took this photo
sees this picture as one

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.840
that can sum up and
represent an entire country.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.428
And I think it'll be best
to let him tell you why.

00:00:56.152 --> 00:00:58.110
NARRATOR 1: Standard and
Poor's gives countries

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.360
independent credit ratings based
on those countries' finances.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.520
The better a rating
a country is given,

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.170
the more positively it's
looked upon by investors

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.830
in the public.

00:02:17.036 --> 00:02:18.410
NARRATOR 1: Reports
that came out

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.820
after Brazil's World Cup found
that thousands of poverty

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.030
stricken citizens
lost their homes

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.650
as a result of new stadiums
and infrastructure.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.180
Billions of dollars
that could've

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.860
been spent on
sanitation or education

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.770
went to the soccer
tournament instead.

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.880
And still, many poor
citizens embraced it.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.100
And this is the
dichotomy that attracted

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.510
Jairo to take this photograph.

00:03:08.177 --> 00:03:09.760

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.370
NARRATOR 2: About 2,000
people made their living

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.830
working at Smokey Mountain,
and thousands more

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.350
continue to sift through toxic
garbage to eke out a living.

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.820
Many of these
people are children.
