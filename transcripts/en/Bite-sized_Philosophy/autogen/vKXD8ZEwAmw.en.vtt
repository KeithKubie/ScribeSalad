00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.629
so the question was positive emotions

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639
so the question was positive emotions
 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:04.999
so the question was positive emotions
mediated by dopamine when you're

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009
mediated by dopamine when you're
 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:06.800
mediated by dopamine when you're
advancing toward something say or when

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810
advancing toward something say or when
 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.210
advancing toward something say or when
you have a cue that something good is

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220
you have a cue that something good is
 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.549
you have a cue that something good is
about to happen what is the system that

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559
about to happen what is the system that
 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.560
about to happen what is the system that
mediates positive emotion at the

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570
mediates positive emotion at the
 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:21.890
mediates positive emotion at the
satiation level yeah okay okay well

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900
satiation level yeah okay okay well
 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.960
satiation level yeah okay okay well
let's start with the satiation issue

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970
let's start with the satiation issue
 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.900
let's start with the satiation issue
that seems mostly regulated by serotonin

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910
that seems mostly regulated by serotonin
 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.650
that seems mostly regulated by serotonin
the opiate issue is there are other

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660
the opiate issue is there are other
 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.080
the opiate issue is there are other
forms of specific reward that don't seem

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090
forms of specific reward that don't seem
 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.060
forms of specific reward that don't seem
to be merely motivated or merely

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070
to be merely motivated or merely
 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.880
to be merely motivated or merely
underpinned by dopamine and the opiate

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890
underpinned by dopamine and the opiate
 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.500
underpinned by dopamine and the opiate
system would be one of those there's an

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510
system would be one of those there's an
 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.340
system would be one of those there's an
oxytocin system as well so there are

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350
oxytocin system as well so there are
 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.500
oxytocin system as well so there are
other biochemical systems that are

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510
other biochemical systems that are
 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.270
other biochemical systems that are
involved in more specific forms of

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280
involved in more specific forms of
 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.900
involved in more specific forms of
reward but the thing that's common among

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910
 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.160
instances that make it appear that

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170
instances that make it appear that
 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.299
instances that make it appear that
you're moving forward is the

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309
you're moving forward is the
 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.310
you're moving forward is the
dopaminergic element roughly speaking

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320
dopaminergic element roughly speaking
 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.880
dopaminergic element roughly speaking
and then one of the things that happens

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890
and then one of the things that happens
 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.219
and then one of the things that happens
if you're higher in serotonin because

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229
if you're higher in serotonin because
 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.780
if you're higher in serotonin because
you're more dominant is that you're more

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790
you're more dominant is that you're more
 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.160
you're more dominant is that you're more
satiated all the time

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170
satiated all the time
 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.960
satiated all the time
that's why people who are low in the

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970
that's why people who are low in the
 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.060
that's why people who are low in the
dominance hierarchy with decreased

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070
dominance hierarchy with decreased
 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.550
dominance hierarchy with decreased
levels of serotonin are more impulsive

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560
levels of serotonin are more impulsive
 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.280
levels of serotonin are more impulsive
and also more emotionally disregulated

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290
and also more emotionally disregulated
 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.920
and also more emotionally disregulated
they're more impulsive because hey you

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930
they're more impulsive because hey you
 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.390
they're more impulsive because hey you
take your positive thing when you can

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400
take your positive thing when you can
 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.140
take your positive thing when you can
get it and so they're more dissatisfied

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150
get it and so they're more dissatisfied
 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.880
get it and so they're more dissatisfied
they're more looking for anything that

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890
they're more looking for anything that
 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.510
they're more looking for anything that
will produce a positive outcome and then

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520
will produce a positive outcome and then
 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.170
will produce a positive outcome and then
they're also more likely to experience

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180
they're also more likely to experience
 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.300
they're also more likely to experience
diffuse negative emotion partly because

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310
diffuse negative emotion partly because
 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.480
diffuse negative emotion partly because
their serotonin systems are lower

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490
their serotonin systems are lower
 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.399
their serotonin systems are lower
indicating their tenuous status in the

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409
indicating their tenuous status in the
 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.620
indicating their tenuous status in the
dominance hierarchy meaning that

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630
dominance hierarchy meaning that
 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.600
dominance hierarchy meaning that
everything they do that's uncertain is

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610
everything they do that's uncertain is
 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.190
everything they do that's uncertain is
far more dangerous so this is also why

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200
far more dangerous so this is also why
 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.840
far more dangerous so this is also why
it's very difficult often when you're

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850
it's very difficult often when you're
 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.340
it's very difficult often when you're
trying to treat someone who's depressed

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350
trying to treat someone who's depressed
 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.899
trying to treat someone who's depressed
because you could say there's not much

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909
because you could say there's not much
 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.990
because you could say there's not much
difference between being depressed and

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000
difference between being depressed and
 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.760
difference between being depressed and
existing in the biochemical State that

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770
existing in the biochemical State that
 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.380
existing in the biochemical State that
being at the bottom of the dominance

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390
being at the bottom of the dominance
 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.749
being at the bottom of the dominance
hierarchy would produce fact they're the

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759
hierarchy would produce fact they're the
 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.209
hierarchy would produce fact they're the
same thing well then the question is are

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219
same thing well then the question is are
 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.089
same thing well then the question is are
you depressed or are you just at the

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099
you depressed or are you just at the
 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.219
you depressed or are you just at the
bottom of a dominance hierarchy because

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229
bottom of a dominance hierarchy because
 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.320
bottom of a dominance hierarchy because
those are not that like the the

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330
those are not that like the the
 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.810
those are not that like the the
symptomatology is

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820
symptomatology is
 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.900
symptomatology is
very very similar but the cause and the

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910
very very similar but the cause and the
 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.810
very very similar but the cause and the
cure are not the same you know cuz you

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820
cure are not the same you know cuz you
 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.250
cure are not the same you know cuz you
might be at the bottom of the dominant

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260
might be at the bottom of the dominant
 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.020
might be at the bottom of the dominant
turkey because you're just everything

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030
turkey because you're just everything
 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.710
turkey because you're just everything
about your life is ruined so and of

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720
about your life is ruined so and of
 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.060
about your life is ruined so and of
course your suffering are you depressed

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070
course your suffering are you depressed
 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.360
course your suffering are you depressed
so no not exactly

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370
so no not exactly
 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.660
so no not exactly
you just have nowhere to go
