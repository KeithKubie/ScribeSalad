00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.720
We set this up to be as natural as possible.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.200
We used historical data on

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.400
the types of trees that would be damaged by

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.200
120 mile an hour winds.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:34.800
We then pulled those trees over using a cable and a winch and then we've been following this for the last 30 years.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.300
This LTER research

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:45.960
is just

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.960
the bread and butter, the basic fabric of

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.880
the Harvard forest. It was established to be a

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.100
laboratory and classroom

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:03.930
where the faculty, the students, all the research scientists really lived spent their lives and so they could

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.980
understand

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.400
nature and the way people interact with nature firsthand all through the year.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.040
Most important result out of this is that although the forest

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.620
look destroyed it actually is

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:31.000
functioning as a perfectly intact ecosystem and what it shows is the ability of nature to cope, the resilience and

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:39.940
persistence of a forest and so it's oftentimes absolutely best to leave nature alone

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.120
to recover on its own.
