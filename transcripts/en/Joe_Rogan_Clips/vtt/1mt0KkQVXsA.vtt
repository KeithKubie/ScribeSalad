Hello freak bitches for them.

2
00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.450
But there's been a bit of an interesting development with ms Sarkeys and if you

3
00:00:07.451 --> 00:00:09.700
like to hear about it, well tell people who she is.

4
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.030
I don't even even know if I need to, but most people don't know.

5
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.710
You live in a very insulated world like straight my mom who, Oh yeah,

6
00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.390
your mum note, but frequency. Yeah. Yeah, of course your mum won't know. Uh,

7
00:00:22.391 --> 00:00:26.650
okay. Any Stuckey's in is uh, an internet feminist who decided, uh,

8
00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.760
after after making a bunch of videos on her YouTube channel in late 2009 through

9
00:00:30.761 --> 00:00:34.360
to like 2010 or something, uh, 12, um,

10
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.140
she ended up getting a sort of, you know,

11
00:00:38.141 --> 00:00:43.141
favorable reception with the progressive intelligence here were very feminist,

12
00:00:43.871 --> 00:00:48.700
very pro social justice and they liked her patter because it's, um,

13
00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.900
pretty stock, pretty pretty stock in trade and it's, and she was,

14
00:00:52.901 --> 00:00:55.840
she came across as being very respectable. You know, she's well presented.

15
00:00:55.841 --> 00:00:59.850
She's attractive, she's well-spoken. She, she knows her pastor and so they,

16
00:00:59.851 --> 00:01:02.230
they promote her. They, you know, they made a big deal over,

17
00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.950
she sounds like a total bigots when she's talking about anything they get

18
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.230
because she'll just say, well, this is men. I mean,

19
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.110
the whole premise of feminism is that men are oppressing women.

20
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.620
And if men aren't oppressing women, then feminism has no argument.

21
00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.220
And they also have a sort of a thing they say to each other where you,

22
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.930
you have the rights to hate, your oppressor is right to do this. And it's like,

23
00:01:28.931 --> 00:01:31.600
okay, but I don't think it's ever right to hate even if you aren't.

24
00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.150
But this is something that she said personally know her personally.

25
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.850
She probably has said it personally, but this is the,

26
00:01:36.851 --> 00:01:39.850
the sort of ideological thought. I mean, if you read the papers,

27
00:01:39.851 --> 00:01:44.590
if you read the, if you read the to that they them thing again. Right. Okay.

28
00:01:44.591 --> 00:01:46.030
They're talking about hardcore feminists.

29
00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.810
We are talking about like a specific sphere of academic feminists in her case,

30
00:01:49.811 --> 00:01:53.630
sex negative sex. [inaudible] yeah, they don't, they don't look,

31
00:01:53.631 --> 00:01:56.770
they don't like objectification. Oh, they don't like sexy women and titties.

32
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.290
Sex negative. Yeah. They don't look sexy. Women. Um,

33
00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.030
the male gaze is oppressing women Croft tomb Raider. Gotcha. Yeah. That was the,

34
00:02:04.031 --> 00:02:08.020
that was part of the big issue, right. It was like sexism because of Lara Croft.

35
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.670
Terrible, terrible oppression. I don't know how women can get over it, but, uh,

36
00:02:12.671 --> 00:02:14.680
any Stuckey's in stepped up and was like, you know,

37
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.200
it's wrong to look at these tits. And everyone was like,

38
00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.730
but she's wearing a really tight top for a reason and she's not real. Yeah.

39
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.330
Uh, but yeah, so basically any he's in comes from a school of sex,

40
00:02:25.331 --> 00:02:30.331
negative feminism and she decided that she would take advantage of all this.

41
00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.020
Now in 2010 there was a video,

42
00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.110
I think it was 2010 that the video was recorded in black and white of her a

43
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.290
university giving a speech where she says, I'm not a gamer.

44
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.520
I had to learn a lot about gaming to get into all this and then come 2012,

45
00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.540
I mean that that video wasn't released until after she did her tropes versus

46
00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:50.320
women in gaming. Kickstarter, 2012 May, 2012 she starts,

47
00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.710
this starts and I was in within the first few days,

48
00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.280
she starts posting updates on that I'm being harassed. And I said, well, yeah,

49
00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.940
people generally react negatively to phenomenal bigots on the internet.

50
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.520
They don't like it. People don't like it. I mean,

51
00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.750
when you say men are oppressing women and everything she says is a variant of

52
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.380
men are oppressing women, unit is the male gaze is highly oppressive to women.

53
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.680
Toxic masculinity is highly oppressive. Women's. Okay. When,

54
00:03:14.681 --> 00:03:18.400
when can men legitimately look at women in eater? No answer. What is,

55
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.190
what is nontoxic masculinity? There's no such thing.

56
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.510
So what you're saying is masculinity and men checking out chicks is just bad and

57
00:03:25.511 --> 00:03:26.140
you hate it.

58
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.420
And the men are all bad for doing this and they're oppressing the women.

59
00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:29.890
They do this. Well,

60
00:03:29.891 --> 00:03:32.440
that's why I said it seems like she's a bit of an opportunist.

61
00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.470
She's got an angle and she realizes that there's a lot of attention that goes

62
00:03:37.511 --> 00:03:40.240
towards that angle and she runs with it. I mean if I turned around and said,

63
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.800
well women,

64
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.710
a bunch of manipula manipulative slags who will take your money and run,

65
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.020
they'd be like, you're a fucking massage, but I gotta stop you there.

66
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.820
Cause I don't think she's ever said all men.

67
00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.880
I don't think she said that she doesn't, she just uses the term men.

68
00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:56.590
I don't think she does. I mean I really don't think she says she has.

69
00:03:56.591 --> 00:04:00.900
That guy is her fucking head guy writes for [inaudible].

70
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:07.270
I know. I'm just doing now nothing basically this, this terrible thing.

71
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.940
But I, I want to, I want to set the record straight if you thinks, because this,

72
00:04:09.941 --> 00:04:12.010
this is something that really annoys me. So, um,

73
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.680
I went to VidCon recently and VidCon. Yeah.

74
00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.040
What is that YouTube convention in Anaheim sounded like a good time.

75
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.430
It was a really good time for me, but it wasn't,

76
00:04:21.431 --> 00:04:24.370
it wasn't for them that their panels look like a bloody death March when they

77
00:04:24.371 --> 00:04:27.250
spot a scene in the car. They like faces like, Oh God. I was like,

78
00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.600
why do they get upset at you? Yeah.

79
00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:30.970
Just cause we sat there listening to what they had to say. In fact,

80
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.670
if you heard about this, no opportunity, I'm insulated. Oh dude, this is crazy.

81
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.320
So any psyches in a,

82
00:04:38.321 --> 00:04:42.490
she spots me sitting in the audience and then she starts freaking out.

83
00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.370
Freaking out. Yeah. She starts, she starts saying things like,

84
00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.190
there's a constant harasser of mine call me. You know,

85
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.760
she called me a shithead and she called me a garbage human, a garbage human.

86
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.190
I did nothing to her. I didn't say what,

87
00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.010
I just sat in the audience while she's there cussing me out on the stage.

88
00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.540
And I mean this now. So she's on the stage with a microphone.

89
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.040
She's calling you a shithead and the garbage human.

90
00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.640
And this was because you have made videos about her. Is that what this is?

91
00:05:06.641 --> 00:05:09.700
Because I've made videos debunking her points, like, and she,

92
00:05:09.701 --> 00:05:13.300
she's under the impression that all of my videos are about her.

93
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.380
And I actually on the ride over, I got people to like count up for me. Uh, I've,

94
00:05:17.381 --> 00:05:22.060
I've made around 30 videos in about four years. Referring to, and that's a lot.

95
00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:25.030
No, no, no. It sounds nice. I did. It sounds like a lot,

96
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.080
but that's less than 4% of the videos I've made. I've made 780 videos.

97
00:05:29.081 --> 00:05:32.440
I work hard. I'm sure you do. But that's still 30 videos.

98
00:05:32.441 --> 00:05:34.330
I don't care if you've made 100 million videos,

99
00:05:34.331 --> 00:05:37.510
you still make 30 videos about her. That's a large number. You know,

100
00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.300
maybe it's a large number compared to Anita who hardly does any bloody work.

101
00:05:40.301 --> 00:05:43.300
But, but that's, that's another interesting point. But what's,

102
00:05:43.301 --> 00:05:48.280
what's interesting about it is if someone puts something out there, you know,

103
00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.690
you're gonna get expect that someone is going to come along,

104
00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.960
especially a guy like you that is very opinionated.

105
00:05:55.961 --> 00:05:59.090
And if someone has very different opinions in yours,

106
00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.130
you are going to have a contrary point. Of course,

107
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.030
that's definitely not harassing if you don't help me, but can't be,

108
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:09.720
we're in a scary position is exemplifying how are you harassing? Like what,

109
00:06:09.721 --> 00:06:11.330
what was the gun? That's the thing.

110
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.690
That's the worst thing you've ever said about her, that she's wrong.

111
00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.030
That's right. Yeah. Well. Yeah, I mean, she's, she,

112
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:20.660
you will never find someone who says she's a, she's a good critic.

113
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.900
She's a terrible critic and she always has been. She's always been,

114
00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:27.140
it's always been rightly pointed out to her that she's cherry-picked every time.

115
00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.030
No one stands by her work.

116
00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.390
She's become like a symbol of feminism because of all the harassment she's

117
00:06:32.391 --> 00:06:37.190
received. Now that is a part of the problem, right? That culture, very strange.

118
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.510
You don't get any props unless someone's sending you horrible messages.

119
00:06:41.511 --> 00:06:45.290
And then a lot of people have been caught doing it to themselves,

120
00:06:45.291 --> 00:06:48.920
which is really fucked up loads like the black lives matter activists and

121
00:06:48.921 --> 00:06:53.360
whatnot. But yeah, so basically she's, her work sucks. It's just bad work.

122
00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.400
I mean, nobody in the video game industry, we turn around and say,

123
00:06:55.401 --> 00:06:57.980
you know what, that's great criticism. Need to only,

124
00:06:57.981 --> 00:07:01.880
only like the progressive press. What black lives matter. Oh, it was,

125
00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.500
it was ages go to a protest.

126
00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:06.680
They basically had run around into the university's compute system,

127
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:10.010
logged into a fake Twitter account or something, send themselves a bomb threat.

128
00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:11.930
And the police tracked it down and they're like,

129
00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:16.210
we have the video camera footage. Yeah, it was,

130
00:07:16.211 --> 00:07:20.960
it was actually really funny or so funny with there need to be a victim. Well,

131
00:07:20.961 --> 00:07:24.650
it's, it validates them. Yeah, it really does. When you don't have an argument,

132
00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:27.590
you need to be a victim. Well, does she expect that somehow?

133
00:07:27.591 --> 00:07:31.040
I know that she's going to be able to put these points out and not have anybody

134
00:07:31.041 --> 00:07:33.800
dispute these points. Oh, I'm guessing so. And she always,

135
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:36.020
she always conflates all criticism with harassment.

136
00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:39.080
She's never addressed the critic. And the first time she addresses a critic,

137
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:43.790
it's me and she's calling me names. Yeah. That's not a good level. Yeah.

138
00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:46.160
It's not, not very good. It's not a good look. She says,

139
00:07:46.161 --> 00:07:50.300
she says that I'm responsible for all of the harassment now. All of it. Well,

140
00:07:50.301 --> 00:07:53.000
at least it's definitely not hers. That's not her fault. No.

141
00:07:53.001 --> 00:07:55.340
It's a controversial opinion and someone disputes it.

142
00:07:55.341 --> 00:07:58.790
That person disputes it as responsible for all the harassment. Well, basically,

143
00:07:58.791 --> 00:08:01.430
I've, I've always, I've always said front right from the get go,

144
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.530
don't have a contact them. Don't ever contact them because for a start, I mean,

145
00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:08.450
they don't want to listen. She's not interested in hearing your fucking opinion.

146
00:08:08.451 --> 00:08:11.270
So both, she's got nothing but contempt for you. But secondly,

147
00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:14.330
don't send a harassment because a, it's a moral and B,

148
00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:18.260
she's got the victim card that gives her money when she, when you go,

149
00:08:18.261 --> 00:08:20.810
when you send her a message saying, Hey, neither, I think you're a bitch.

150
00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.090
She goes, chick Ching, you know,

151
00:08:23.091 --> 00:08:26.120
and then she runs off to the next interview where that she gets paid. I mean,

152
00:08:26.121 --> 00:08:29.240
so some of her speeches at university, she's been paid 20 grand a speech.

153
00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.570
I'm not joking. Right. And it's just, and for her to go,

154
00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:34.340
the internet is being mean to me. Well,

155
00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:36.530
maybe if you want to be in a bigger online, they wouldn't be.

156
00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:39.470
Maybe if we actually did some solid work and didn't say video games and making

157
00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:43.070
everyone sexist, which obviously not, this wouldn't be happening to you.

158
00:08:43.071 --> 00:08:47.360
But the thing that pisses me off most about the accusations towards me of

159
00:08:47.361 --> 00:08:49.670
harassment, apart from the fact that I've never harassed her,

160
00:08:49.671 --> 00:08:50.570
and if there was any evidence,

161
00:08:50.571 --> 00:08:53.830
I'd harassed that it'd be all over the internet right now. You know what I mean?

162
00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:53.931
You,

163
00:08:53.931 --> 00:08:58.110
it would be nothing but Twix bars because they trying to paint me as a harasser

164
00:08:58.111 --> 00:09:01.320
when I'm actually just a critic oppose and I've always been completely against

165
00:09:01.321 --> 00:09:05.220
it. But what really annoys me is that her Kickstarter, if you look at it now,

166
00:09:05.221 --> 00:09:06.054
if you get go to it,

167
00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:09.390
you can pull it up now and you can see tropes versus women and like, you know,

168
00:09:09.391 --> 00:09:12.120
she's got a spill and then, Oh, the terrible messages, the harassment,

169
00:09:12.121 --> 00:09:14.220
the harassment. That was in May,

170
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:17.850
2012 I didn't make a video on YouTube until July,

171
00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:19.920
2013 this has been happening to her.

172
00:09:19.921 --> 00:09:23.610
Her whole career is nothing to do with me is to do with her.

173
00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:27.660
It's because she's a Dick. Everyone can see it.

174
00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:32.160
And I had to call a girl Dick, like gall guy pussy. Yeah, I'm culinary a Dick.

175
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:37.110
You're a Dick. Anything looked into the camera. That's harassment.

176
00:09:37.111 --> 00:09:37.944
Do you want to know something?

177
00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:41.280
I've spoken to a lot of interesting people recently since I've been here,

178
00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.680
lots of people who know you personally,

179
00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:48.570
an eater and they say everyone hates you because you're a Dick.

180
00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:48.901
Oh,

181
00:09:48.901 --> 00:09:52.860
this is again mean you should have seen the article she put up about me today.

182
00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:55.620
Another one. Well, yeah, just calling me harassing and all this stuff.

183
00:09:55.621 --> 00:09:57.630
It's like, no, you're a Dick, Anita. Yes. Be in it.

184
00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:01.230
Did you find a video of her saying that there's no biological difference between

185
00:10:01.231 --> 00:10:05.160
the sexes and that there'll be buried in the middle of [inaudible]?

186
00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:09.090
I really think that it was her, now that I'm thinking about it, I've, I've,

187
00:10:09.091 --> 00:10:10.980
I've looked at it as well, maybe she took it down or something,

188
00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:13.530
so I remember seeing it. I wish I'd say someone's got to save it.

189
00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:17.370
Someone on the internet will be able to tweet to ass or something because it's

190
00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:22.740
so hilarious because it's so contrary to biology, just actual science.

191
00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:24.990
Everything she says is contrary to reality. I mean,

192
00:10:24.991 --> 00:10:27.870
she'll sit there and she'll pick out like, I like the game Hitman in her video,

193
00:10:27.871 --> 00:10:31.740
she said something like, uh, you're incentivized to, to kill the woman.

194
00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:35.820
Then they stuff her body in a trunk and the footage she's using,

195
00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:38.070
she didn't take herself. Obviously it didn't credit.

196
00:10:38.071 --> 00:10:40.880
Whoever took it in the footage she's using, you see like the,

197
00:10:40.881 --> 00:10:44.360
the guy go up and kill the go and you see them lose points. I said, no,

198
00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:47.580
that's a disincentive realization. You know, that they're not incentivizing you.

199
00:10:47.581 --> 00:10:51.000
They're saying that penalizing you for this. Anita, you UJ I mean,

200
00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:54.150
I thought my very first video was to in eater as well,

201
00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:58.050
and our very first video was like July,

202
00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:01.770
2013 and I [inaudible] started off because of her.

203
00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:06.090
We were inspired. Well, kind of, but there was a lot of things that kind of,

204
00:11:06.091 --> 00:11:08.370
you know, that were going on. I was like, you know, I,

205
00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.770
I feel the need to say something just, uh,

206
00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:15.210
but apart from the quality being terrible, I'm bewildered at her.

207
00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:17.430
I listened to her the other day and I was just like, wow,

208
00:11:17.431 --> 00:11:20.610
I had no idea what was going on. And I was just like, he said,

209
00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.590
I think you're just wrong on this. I think you,

210
00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:27.130
I don't think you understand like the, there is a lot to this that you, you've,

211
00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:31.050
you've left out, I should have said cherry picked, but you know, and that's,

212
00:11:31.051 --> 00:11:33.210
that's something that's dog to hell. Correct. Cause that's all she's ever done.

213
00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:35.220
Her Chris's is terrible and everyone knows it.

214
00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:39.720
Nobody likes it because she's a divisive bitch and all she does is play the

215
00:11:39.721 --> 00:11:42.660
victim. She's got nothing, she has nothing and all she does,

216
00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:44.910
as long as it's not talking about her and specifically because we're,

217
00:11:44.911 --> 00:11:46.140
we're kind of beating her down here.

218
00:11:46.141 --> 00:11:51.030
But it's hard to think of anything genuinely good about her talking about her.

219
00:11:51.031 --> 00:11:51.181
I mean,

220
00:11:51.181 --> 00:11:54.310
what I'm saying is about these ideas instead of concentrating on her as a

221
00:11:54.311 --> 00:11:55.500
person, that's the point.

222
00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:59.710
They'd been debunked a million times all over the internet by everyone and their

223
00:11:59.711 --> 00:12:02.830
mother at this point. I do. I, well, why do I want to get to,

224
00:12:02.831 --> 00:12:07.831
what's interesting to me is what causes these people to group up into these

225
00:12:08.411 --> 00:12:10.420
weird sort of echo chambers.

226
00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:13.930
They start reiterating things that don't really work or make sense.

227
00:12:13.931 --> 00:12:16.690
Like there's no biological difference between men and women,

228
00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:18.820
especially when it comes to strength. There's,

229
00:12:18.821 --> 00:12:23.410
and then the tropes about video games and also like here's the other thing,

230
00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:26.410
like when that Gamergate thing happened, yeah, it was,

231
00:12:26.411 --> 00:12:31.411
it was really fascinating to me that everybody wanted to absolutely lump people

232
00:12:31.451 --> 00:12:35.470
in one or two categories and the two categories of people that are appalled to

233
00:12:35.471 --> 00:12:38.320
it, appalled by it and that think that, you know,

234
00:12:38.321 --> 00:12:40.780
sexism is a Boren and all this stuff is terrible.

235
00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:43.630
And then the other people who supposedly if you,

236
00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:48.670
if you wanted some sexy images and video games, you had to be a piece of shit.

237
00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:52.210
Oh yeah. Like if he's likes negative feminists, Oh yeah. Well that,

238
00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:55.570
but it got into this weird category where people were like, Hey,

239
00:12:55.571 --> 00:12:58.360
we don't want you meddling with, with art.

240
00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:02.260
And whether it's a Frank visit up censoring it. Yeah. I mean, look,

241
00:13:02.261 --> 00:13:06.430
if you look at some of Frazetta stuff with the girls at the bikinis and swords

242
00:13:06.431 --> 00:13:09.670
and familiar, but I mean famous fantasy artists.

243
00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:13.390
Oh well we sort of like talking about like the eighties yes. Oral earlier,

244
00:13:13.391 --> 00:13:15.940
beautifully painted. These oiled barbarians.

245
00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:20.190
It's a celebration of the human fizzy cause there's perfect presentive. Yes,

246
00:13:20.191 --> 00:13:21.010
yes, yes.

247
00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:26.010
It's all Robert Howard's books on Conan and Frazetta was like the most famous of

248
00:13:27.071 --> 00:13:27.760
the, yeah, it was,

249
00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:32.760
but it's very cartoonish depictions of women with giant tits and Brian blood all

250
00:13:34.301 --> 00:13:38.560
over the place and it's silliness doesn't make you hate women.

251
00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:39.753
That's what's gross.

252
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.840
Like just like looking at Fabio on the cover of a romance novel doesn't mean you

253
00:13:43.841 --> 00:13:48.130
hate men. Yeah, right. In fact, it seems you're kind of lionizing them. Look,

254
00:13:48.131 --> 00:13:51.550
this is, this is the perfect depiction of what the artist wanted.

255
00:13:51.551 --> 00:13:55.510
See like a man looked like in a huge rippling hero carrying the maiden or

256
00:13:55.511 --> 00:13:58.240
whatever. But it becomes this weird thing when it's a man.

257
00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:00.850
People don't have a problem with it. No one says that.

258
00:14:00.851 --> 00:14:05.851
A demonizes the male figure and that you know that you have set these unnatural

259
00:14:06.011 --> 00:14:09.370
standards, so you fucked with the self esteem of all these young men,

260
00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:13.840
but you absolutely have in the same way you do it with women like body shaming

261
00:14:13.841 --> 00:14:17.020
or you know, having ridiculous standards for bodies for females.

262
00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:22.150
That works with men too. It's the same, yeah, of course does, but the led kit,

263
00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:24.010
because feminists I called tamales.

264
00:14:24.011 --> 00:14:26.770
The world is women being oppressed and men the oppresses and it's okay to hate

265
00:14:26.771 --> 00:14:30.910
your oppressor. That's the, that's the root of all feminist thought.

266
00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:34.150
But that's why I want to talk about this in terms of the ideas because I think

267
00:14:34.151 --> 00:14:37.120
it's kind of the same thing as the right versus the left.

268
00:14:37.121 --> 00:14:40.360
And I think it's all like a symptom of human psychology.

269
00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:43.270
The right versus the left is tribalism. It is tribalism,

270
00:14:43.271 --> 00:14:46.330
but so it's female versus male. It's, it's these,

271
00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:49.930
when you look at this blind allegiance towards anyone with a vagina,

272
00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:53.330
it's very similar to someone who is blind allegiance to is anyone who is in a

273
00:14:53.331 --> 00:14:57.560
red state. This VidCon thing that you went to, what?

274
00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:01.520
Who puts this together? Hankin John Green. And who are they?

275
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:05.420
The vlog brothers. They're famous YouTubers. And uh,

276
00:15:05.421 --> 00:15:09.500
I find it very interesting when Anita was calling me a shithead and garbage

277
00:15:09.501 --> 00:15:12.980
human, that's a direct violation of that code of conduct.

278
00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:15.380
And did I do anything about it? No,

279
00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:20.600
because she's a feminist because she's a woman. Oh. Because she gets special.

280
00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:22.243
It's because she's in the,

281
00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:25.450
he's in because she gets special treatment because at this point she's basically

282
00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:30.110
become the avatar feminism. If she fails, I swear to God I didn't that,

283
00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:33.200
I mean she respected in that world. No, no, no. Everyone hates her.

284
00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:35.480
Why did they still prop her up? Because she's an Esau.

285
00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:38.630
Keizan if she doesn't make any sense, why not? I mean, well,

286
00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:44.660
there's a myth OS that's built up around her and get word. Yes.

287
00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:47.690
It's, um, and they've all propped her up.

288
00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:51.350
They've all propped her up level, said good things about her.

289
00:15:51.351 --> 00:15:56.090
They've all defended her. And if it turns out that she is in fact an abuser,

290
00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:59.480
which she did according to the VidCon code of conduct,

291
00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:03.170
which is what is the code of conduct. Oh, I can't remember it verbatim,

292
00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:06.290
but I read out a video. Uh, it's one of my latest videos. Um,

293
00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:09.080
it was just a quick message to Hank and John Green. And, uh,

294
00:16:09.081 --> 00:16:11.270
I know that thousands of people email them saying, Hey, look,

295
00:16:11.271 --> 00:16:15.170
she did violate your code of conduct from a position of institutional privilege

296
00:16:15.171 --> 00:16:17.390
at VidCon. She was on the panel. I didn't have a microphone.

297
00:16:17.391 --> 00:16:19.300
She had a microphone. She's calling me names.

298
00:16:19.301 --> 00:16:20.750
She's accusing me of things on true.

299
00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:24.980
She was doing that while you were in the audience directly looking me in the

300
00:16:24.981 --> 00:16:28.610
eye. And it was like, okay, that's fine. But, uh,

301
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:33.530
that's not right. And they've done nothing. They have done nothing.

302
00:16:33.531 --> 00:16:37.220
They've said nothing. And then afterwards,

303
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:40.340
all I got from her fans and, and I mean like, you know,

304
00:16:40.341 --> 00:16:41.630
hundreds and hundreds of messages,

305
00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:46.220
and I've just retweeted them all night with exactly the same language she uses

306
00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:47.690
when she's displaying. Oh,

307
00:16:47.691 --> 00:16:51.320
look at the nasty messages I'm guessing of people calling me a garbage human,

308
00:16:51.321 --> 00:16:55.730
which is what she'd called me. And so she has done absolutely nothing different.

309
00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:59.150
And so I said right hand can John, she's violated your code of conduct.

310
00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:04.220
Her fans, she's incited a cyber mob. Harassers exactly as she claims I do.

311
00:17:04.221 --> 00:17:07.730
But she has actually done this. Then on the Saturday,

312
00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:12.440
she was due to be on a panel about cyber harassment.

313
00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:17.390
See? But he can't be harassment when she's a woman.

314
00:17:17.391 --> 00:17:20.810
And you're a man because you are the oppressor.

315
00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:22.790
So it's the same thing as racism,

316
00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:26.180
like the black person being racist against a white person possible.

317
00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:26.621
But the only,

318
00:17:26.621 --> 00:17:31.621
the only reason to do this then to not to take no action is if you are highly

319
00:17:32.211 --> 00:17:34.150
ideological and in. Interesting.

320
00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:38.570
So you feel like they're high D I highly ideological, incredibly biased.

321
00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:42.140
But why are they, if they're YouTube stars, I mean, aren't they like,

322
00:17:42.141 --> 00:17:44.810
don't they understand? They're very progressive, very progressive.

323
00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:47.300
You're fairly progressive too. I'm a liberal. I'm not progressive.

324
00:17:47.301 --> 00:17:48.410
What is the difference between a liberal,

325
00:17:48.411 --> 00:17:50.310
a liberal and cruelty of opportunity or progressive

326
00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:52.770
<v 1>wants? Quality of outcome. Quality of out</v>

327
00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:00.450
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>
