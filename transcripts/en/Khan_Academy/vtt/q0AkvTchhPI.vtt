00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:06.220
We're on problem 205.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.640
In the table above, what
is the number of green

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.410
marbles in jar R?

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.430
OK.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.950
Let's see, they give us
a table, they have

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:21.680
jars P, Q, and R.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:31.860
They say number of red,
is x, y, and x.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:41.460
And they tell us the number
of green is y, z, and z.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:52.520
And then they tell us the total
is 80, 120, and 160.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.540
And they say, in the table
above, what is the number of

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.610
green marbles in jars?

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.875
So we need to solve for z.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.140
So what we have here is
three variables and

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.220
we have three unknowns.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.220
We actually have three equations
because we know that

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.100
the red plus the green is equal
to the total for any one

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.090
of the jars.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:23.310
y plus z is equal to 120 and
x plus z is equal to 160.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.170
So let's just try to solve
this equation.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.720
So let's try to get everything--
I don't know,

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.290
what do we want to
cancel out first?

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.980
What happens if we subtract that
equation from this one?

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.490
Let me write that one over.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:42.630
So that's x plus y
is equal to 80.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.220
I just rewrote that
column down here.

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.390
Now, if we were to subtract this
from that-- let's just

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:50.560
well multiply it
by negative 1.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.300
So, minus x, minus
y, minus 80.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.710
And now let's just add them.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:01.190
We get 0 plus z minus y, so we
get z minus y is equal to--

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:02.960
what's 160 minus 80?

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.220
Well that's just 80.

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.834
And now, this is interesting,
we have x minus y equals 80,

00:02:08.834 --> 00:02:10.669
and z plus y is equal to 120.

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:11.850
So I think we're pretty close.

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:12.780
Let's write that.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.390
So we could write
this equation--

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.140
I'll write it in yellow.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:22.710
z plus y-- I just switched the
order-- is equal to 120.

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.340
But, in the back of my mind, I'm
like, well, all I have to

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.110
do is figure out these.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.570
If I can figure out
these as fast as

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.920
possible, all the better.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.560
Add these two equations.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.980
2z plus 0 is equal to 240.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.080
z is equal to 120.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.400
And that's the number of
green marbles in jar R.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.070
120.

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.420
And that is not one
of the choices.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.500
Where did I make a mistake?

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.920
I often make a mistake
right near the end.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.160
Let's see.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.270
x plus z.

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.940
Let me see.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.270
X plus y is equal to 80.

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:01.780
y plus z is equal to 120.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.240
x plus z is equal to 160.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.350
Now, I took this equation--
no, I took this one and I

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:12.640
multiplied it by negative
1 and put it here.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.550
Minus x, minus y, is
equal to minus 80.

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.150
Then I added these two.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.000
So the x's cancel out and you're
left with z minus y is

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.700
equal to 80.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.310
And then, this equation says y
plus z is equal to 120-- oh, I

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.760
see my mistake.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.320
You see, I made it
right at the end.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.930
z minus y is equal to 80.

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.540
z plus y is equal to 120.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.840
80 plus 120 is not 240.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.820
80 plus 120 is 200.

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.980
So 2z is equal to 200.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.520
z is equal to 100.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.320
Boneheaded mistake.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.730
So the answer is 100.

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.800
D.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.690
Next question.

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.200
Question 206.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:07.060
In the circle above, PQ-- let
me draw the circle above.

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.950
This is the circle above.

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.890
Let's see, in the circle
above, PQ-- OK

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.180
they then draw diameter.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.382
Let me draw diameter as well.

00:04:14.382 --> 00:04:17.130
Because I want to be accurate.

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:24.020
So that's diameter and they
labelled this as O and R.

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.940
And they say PQ-- so they have
this other line up here that

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.960
this is parallel to
the diameter.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.590
So let me draw it up here.

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.160
Maybe it looks something
like this.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.160
That's parallel.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.970
And they call this point
P and this point Q.

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.845
And then they have another
line they say

00:04:41.845 --> 00:04:43.790
is a 35 degree angle.

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.600
Let me see if I can draw that.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.600
You have a line that goes
from here to here.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.720
And they tell us
that this angle

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.140
right here is 35 degrees.

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.880
In the circle above, PQ is
parallel to diameter OR.

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.620
And OR has length 18.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.090
What is the length
of minor arc PQ?

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.750
Fascinating.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:21.080
So, they want to know
what this is.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.930
So, we can figure out the
circumference of this circle.

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.330
The circumference, we
know its diameter.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.540
It's just going to be the
diameter times pi.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.800
So, we already know that the
circumference of the circle is

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.470
18 pi or 2 times the
radius times pi.

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:34.920
But same thing.

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.810
Now, in order to figure out this
arc length, what would be

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.540
useful-- and I don't know yet if
I can figure it out, is if

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:45.380
we could figure out this
angle right here.

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:46.970
If we could figure out
this angle right

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:49.740
here, we'd be done.

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.495
We could easily figure it out
because that angle as a

00:05:54.495 --> 00:05:57.690
proportion of 360 would be the
same relative proportion of

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.140
the total radius.

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:02.600
So let's see if we can figure
out what that angle is.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.100
Just given the information
they've given us.

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:10.130
This angle here's is going
to be 35 degrees.

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:11.080
And how did I know that?

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.080
Well, those are those are
opposite inside angles.

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:16.620
Let me see.

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.540
What matters is-- let me think
about it a little bit.

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.250
And this is on the circle.

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:28.500
Oh, well this is interesting.

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:33.580
We should use the information.

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:34.220
This is a circle.

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.930
So, what is the length
of that right there?

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:43.530
Well, if the diameter is 18 then
the radius is 9, right?

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:48.800
If that length is 9, than this
length is also going to be 9.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.060
And if that length is 9--
oh this is interesting.

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.690
This length is 9, this
length is also 9.

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:58.730
That length also has to be 9.

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:01.490
They're both radiuses of the
circle which tells us that

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:03.380
this, right here, is kind
of an isosceles

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.300
triangle on its side.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.550
It looks like that.

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:10.050
Where these sides are equal.

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:11.250
They're both equal to 9.

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:15.250
So, if this is a 35 degree
angle, then this, right here,

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:17.350
has to be a 35 degree
angle as well.

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:18.530
I know you can't read it.

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:24.030
Because the base angles of an
isosceles triangle are equal.

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:25.260
I could redraw it like this.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:26.510
This is an interesting
problem.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.510
So, if we know that length is
equal to that length, we know

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:34.190
that angle is equal
to that angle.

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:38.230
So, then we know that this angle
right here has also got

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:43.800
to be equal to 35.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.550
This is useful because if this
angle is 35 and this angle is

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:50.060
35, what is this entire angle?

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:52.170
What is that entire angle?

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:54.840
Well that entire angle--
let me draw it up here.

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.300
So that's the PQ side.

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:59.100
So, this is also 35.

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:02.180
So this entire angle
right here is 70.

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:04.850
35 plus 35.

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:06.670
I should have drawn
this a lot bigger.

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:08.330
So, this right here
is 70 degrees.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:08.980
And how do I figure it out?

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:12.640
I figure out this 35 because
this is an isosceles triangle.

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.460
And I figured out
that this is 35.

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:19.960
I figured out that this is right
here is 35 because it's

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.120
an opposite angle from a
transversal between two

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:22.930
parallel lines.

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:28.210
Because that line is parallel
to that line.

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:32.070
So, that was all
pretty useful.

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:36.520
Now, what if there was only
a way to figure out

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:37.620
what this angle was?

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:40.419
Because if we know this angle
and this angle, then we know

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:42.870
for sure this angle.

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:45.440
Well, I'm going to use
the same argument.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:50.350
This line right here, this is
a radius of the triangle.

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:52.900
So this side right
here is also 9.

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:54.030
That side.

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:58.470
so, if we know that this side is
equal to this side-- let me

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:00.560
draw the triangle that I'm
talking about now, because I

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.450
think this is an important
problem.

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:04.465
So, I'm trying to figure
out the value of

00:09:04.465 --> 00:09:06.800
this upside down triangle.

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.230
And I'll label it so you know
what I'm talking about.

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:10.710
So, this is P.

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:11.830
This is Q.

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:15.180
And this is the center
of the circle.

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:18.360
And we know that the side
is 9, this side is 9.

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:21.960
And we just figured out that
this angle right here is 70.

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:25.820
This was 35 plus another 35.

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:27.840
Once again, another isosceles
triangle.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.116
If this side is equal to that
side, that this angle is equal

00:09:30.116 --> 00:09:31.210
to this angle.

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:34.460
So, this angle also has
to be equal to 70.

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:35.800
And now, if we know
two angles of a

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.570
triangle, we know the third.

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:38.430
This has to be--

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:38.580

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:39.090
I'm on a roll.

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:41.760
I'm not going to answer
the phone.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.180
Oh I think it's my wife.

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:46.880
I'm going to call her back
right after this.

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.060
So what was I doing?

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:49.390
I lost my train of thought.

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:50.080
I was on a roll.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:53.900
If this angle is 70 degrees,
this angle is 70 degrees, then

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:54.930
this angle has to be what?

00:09:54.930 --> 00:10:01.740
70 plus 70 plus x is equal
to 180 degrees.

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:06.920
140 plus x is equal
to 40 degrees.

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.540
Sorry, is equal to 180.

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:10.150
My brain was skipping ahead.

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:12.580
x is equal to 40 degrees.

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:13.040
OK.

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:16.080
So that angle is 40 degrees
which is the same thing as

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:17.350
that angle.

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:19.410
So the length of-- so let's
go back to the problem.

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:22.580
We have to figure out what
this arc length is.

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:29.750
So, this angle, which is 40 over
all the degrees in the

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:34.300
circle, over 360, is going to be
equal to this arc length--

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:37.370
let's just call it x-- over
the circumference

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:38.550
of the whole circle.

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:40.770
And we know that the
circumference of the full

00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:45.300
circle is 18 pi.

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:46.620
Let's see if we can
simplify this.

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:49.820
40 goes into 360-- that's 1/9.

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:51.825
So to this becomes 1 over 9.

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:59.646
Then we could cross multiply and
get 9x is equal to 18 pi.

00:10:59.646 --> 00:11:06.090
x is equal to, 18 pi divided
by 9, is equal to 2 pi.

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:08.120
And, luckily, that's
one of the choices.

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.700
It's choice A.

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:10.720
See you in the next video.

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.920
I now have to call my wife.
