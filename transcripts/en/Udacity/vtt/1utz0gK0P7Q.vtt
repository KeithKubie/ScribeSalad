00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.660
Today, we'll talk about configuration. Configuration is a very routine kind of

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:09.200
design task in which all the components of the design are already known.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.630
The task now is to assign values to the variables of those components so

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.949
they can be arranged according to some constraints.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.860
Configuration will be your first part under the unit on designing creativity.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.950
We'll start by talking about design, then we'll define configuration. Then we

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.660
trace through the process of configuration, a specific measure called planned

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.810
refinement. Finally, we'll connect configuration to several earlier topics we

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.530
have discussed such as classification, case based reasoning, and planning.
