LAURENCE MORONEY:
Laurence Moroney

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:05.990
here on the Coffee With a
Googler stage on level two.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:07.448
And I have a great
pleasure to chat

00:00:07.448 --> 00:00:08.835
with David Burke
about Android M.

00:00:08.835 --> 00:00:10.210
And hopefully
you've had a chance

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.160
to download the Android
M developer preview.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.030
I took a look at it
last night, and I've

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.420
started calling it Android Mmm.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.430
And so Dave, welcome
to the stage.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:19.770
And thanks for joining us.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:20.120
DAVID BURKE: Thank you.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.986
Thanks for inviting me.

00:00:20.986 --> 00:00:23.111
LAURENCE MORONEY: I hear
we had a little bit of fun

00:00:23.111 --> 00:00:26.280
last night, yesterday, with
the whole keynote and something

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.000
that was on your watch face.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.009
DAVID BURKE: Yeah, so I'm
wearing this new Huawei Watch.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:32.870
It's super nice.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.769
And I decided I wanted to
hack up my own watch face.

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:37.560
And I was trying to
think what I should do.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.890
So of course, people
speculated about what

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.450
the name of the new
dessert's going to be.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.860
So what I did was I created
a watch face that basically

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.300
alternates all my favorite
desserts beginning with M.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.694
It's very simple to code up.

00:00:49.694 --> 00:00:51.610
LAURENCE MORONEY: You
should open source that.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:52.630
DAVID BURKE: Indeed.

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.260
And then the actual doodles
were drawn by Dan Sandler.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.370
Dan is a wizard at
creating amazing doodles.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.150
He does all our Easter
eggs in Android.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.780
So he literally whipped
up, like, seven or eight

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:03.582
desserts for me.

00:01:03.582 --> 00:01:05.540
And then when I went on
stage, I decided, well,

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.530
I might as well put one
that's very easy to recognize

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.196
from a distance.

00:01:08.196 --> 00:01:09.420
So I fixed it on Milkshake.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.340
And then when I was handing over
to David Singleton, I was like,

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.696
and now I'd like to
welcome David Singleton up

00:01:13.696 --> 00:01:15.420
to the stage to talk to
you about Android Wear.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.000
And if you look at me, I'm kind
of, like, really pronounced.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.416
So it worked out pretty well
because The Verge then picked

00:01:20.416 --> 00:01:21.670
up on it and put it on Reddit.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.165
And then Reddit just goes whoo.

00:01:23.165 --> 00:01:24.290
And everyone's speculating.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:25.494
It's like, oh, it's
going to be Milkshake,

00:01:25.494 --> 00:01:26.260
it's going to be Milkshake.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.030
And then I figured
I'd wait a little bit.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.400
And then I posted on Twitter.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.734
And I took multiple
shots of the watch.

00:01:31.734 --> 00:01:33.900
You can see it's currently
on Marshmallow right now.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:34.570
LAURENCE MORONEY:
That's Marshmallow.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.330
OK, I was wondering.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:36.150
DAVID BURKE: It's
Marshmallow, yeah.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.233
Oh, and there's Malt Ball.

00:01:37.233 --> 00:01:38.716
Or Malteser, as
we would call it.

00:01:38.716 --> 00:01:40.340
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Oh, I love Maltesers.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.030
DAVID BURKE: And so then I
posted on Twitter, going,

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.950
rumors of Milkshake
are exaggerated.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.900
It actually has all my
favorite M desserts.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.131
My favorite tweet was somebody
went, troll level keynote.

00:01:52.131 --> 00:01:54.130
LAURENCE MORONEY: Hey,
if you're going to do it,

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.055
that's the place, right?

00:01:55.055 --> 00:01:55.723
DAVID BURKE: I was
having some fun.

00:01:55.723 --> 00:01:56.690
But it's great.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:57.160
LAURENCE MORONEY:
One of the things

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.076
that struck me when you
were talking yesterday

00:01:59.076 --> 00:02:02.220
about Android M was really
the focus on quality.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.650
I have a Nexus 5, and I upgraded
it from KitKat to Lollipop

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:06.240
last year.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.580
And I really like Lollipop.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.837
And I'm, like,
surprised and impressed

00:02:09.837 --> 00:02:11.420
that if we can have
even more quality.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.550
So could you tell
us a little bit

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.080
about what you're
doing with that?

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.940
DAVID BURKE: The
way to think about M

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.260
is, well, first to
understand M, you sort of

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.330
have to think about
what was L, or Lollipop.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.320
So with Lollipop, we had
literally the biggest release

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.180
we'd built since 1.0.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.160
Massive changes, right?

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.960
So material design, which
is our new design language.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.490
We had a 64-bit support.

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.140
We changed the run time.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.712
We changed how parts of
the network stack work.

00:02:34.712 --> 00:02:36.170
I mean, we went a
little bit crazy.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.560
And then if that
wasn't enough, we then

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.660
did Android TV and Android
Auto and Android Wear.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.490
So it was a very
big release for us.

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.530
We're super proud
of what we did.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.670
But for M, what
we wanted to do is

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.480
we wanted to go back to the
core, go back to the basics,

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.900
and think about the
core user experience.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.650
Just like all the little
things that we could do better.

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.812
And it's not really, bugs aside.

00:02:56.812 --> 00:02:58.020
Of course, we're fixing bugs.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.830
But it's more
about, let's rethink

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.160
how certain things have
worked since the beginning.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.140
Can we make it better?

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.640
And if we do this
across the board,

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.850
can we really come up with a
very nice, polished release?

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.190
That's really what
M's about, basically.

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.550
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool, yeah.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:09.740
I'm looking forward to it.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:10.940
One of the
crowd-pleasers yesterday

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:11.900
was the volume control.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:12.400
DAVID BURKE: Right.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.610
Yeah.

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.610
LAURENCE MORONEY: I have to
say that is one of the things

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.734
that I'm really looking
forward to having improved.

00:03:16.734 --> 00:03:18.790
DAVID BURKE: Yeah,
so I think we,

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.680
with Lollipop, we
over-rotated on flexibility

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.300
and probably made it a
little bit more complicated

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.049
than it should be.

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.140
So good news is
we simplified it,

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.500
and it works as you'd expect.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.420
But we also then did
add a drop-down that

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.860
allows you to change the
stream volumes, which

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.240
is pretty handy because
often you'll want your media

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.880
volume different to
your alarm volume,

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.910
different to your earpiece
volume for a call.

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.070
So it's just a very
quick way of getting it,

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.361
but it doesn't overcomplicate.

00:03:40.361 --> 00:03:42.860
So it was one of those examples
of a little thing we changed

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.560
that improves the experience.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.190
LAURENCE MORONEY: Like when I'm
listening to music on my phone,

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.515
and then I get a hangouts ding.

00:03:48.515 --> 00:03:49.510
And at the same volume.

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.380
It's like-- Right,
so it's good stuff.

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:53.880
Another really neat
thing that I saw

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.780
was, I'm calling it
granular app permissions.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.694
I don't know what the
actual proper name is.

00:03:58.694 --> 00:04:00.360
But like, the way
that you can actually,

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.980
first of all, on
demand have the app

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.730
permissions instead of up front.

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.549
And then also the user
can go in later on

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:06.840
and change all the permissions.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.304
DAVID BURKE: Yeah, and I think
when Android started out,

00:04:09.304 --> 00:04:11.970
we would ask for the permissions
up front before you install it.

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.434
I think if you look at what's
happened over the last seven

00:04:14.434 --> 00:04:16.850
years or so since we first
launched the very first Android

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.709
device, mobile apps have gotten
more and more complicated.

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.870
They do more and more.

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.780
They're location aware and
user aware and what not.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.029
And so as a result
you're seeing apps

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:28.320
with more and more permissions.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.620
And so the problem with asking
all the permissions up front

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.620
is it's, as a user you start
getting a little jaded.

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:33.970
You're like, am I
even reading this?

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.090
LAURENCE MORONEY:
There's a long list,

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.190
DAVID BURKE:
There's a long list.

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.204
How do I select the
things I do or don't want?

00:04:37.204 --> 00:04:38.870
So we decided it was
time to rethink it.

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.570
And so now we have basically
two things we've done.

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.380
One is we've simplified
the set of permissions

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.569
to a smaller number of
easily understood things.

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:48.610
And we sort of re-architected
the platform around

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:49.990
that so they fit
into those buckets.

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.620
So things like microphone access
or camera access or location

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:53.310
access.

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.810
And then the second
thing we've done

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.632
is we now, rather than ask
for them at installation time,

00:04:57.632 --> 00:04:59.840
we ask for them at run time,
when the app is actually

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:00.560
running.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.940
And then we put a bunch of
thought into little details

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.127
like, if the app asks
and the user says

00:05:07.127 --> 00:05:09.710
no, the second time if the app
asks, we're going to say never,

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.080
user gets a chance to
say, never ask again.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.470
But we do that the second time
because what can sometimes

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:15.120
happen is the user
can accidentally

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.036
press the wrong thing.

00:05:16.036 --> 00:05:18.440
Then the developer's stuck.

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.482
And so we put a bunch
of thought into it.

00:05:20.482 --> 00:05:21.940
The other nice side
effect of it is

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.811
we've noticed that,
if you have an app

00:05:23.811 --> 00:05:25.310
and you're updating
it on Play Store

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:26.570
and you needed to add a
permission because you're

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:27.530
adding a new feature.

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.430
Let's say you were
adding location awareness

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.539
to a traffic app or
something in a later release.

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:34.330
Well, you'd have location
at the beginning,

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.530
but let's just imagine.

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.360
What would happen is that the
update would require the user

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.600
to go into Play
Store and actually

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.140
say yes to the upgrade.

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.840
Now with the new
permission model,

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:46.745
it will just update
automatically.

00:05:46.745 --> 00:05:49.050
And it's only when the user
goes to use the app does

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.790
the permission come up.

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:51.226
So it's better for the
developer, and it's better

00:05:51.226 --> 00:05:52.060
for the user.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.510
LAURENCE MORONEY: It makes more
sense when you think about it.

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:54.968
It's like it's
almost common sense.

00:05:54.968 --> 00:05:58.086
And also like, sometimes
a bad experience.

00:05:58.086 --> 00:05:59.710
Like I pick a new
app in the App Store,

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:01.680
and then it has this
100 permissions.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.263
I don't even know what the app
does yet and I have to give it.

00:06:04.263 --> 00:06:05.970
So I really like that update.

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:06.910
So it's pretty cool.

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:07.630
DAVID BURKE: The other
thing just to mention

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:08.810
is that you can also
go into the Settings

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:10.220
and you can actually turn
off permissions as well.

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:11.220
So after the fact.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:11.530
LAURENCE MORONEY: Exactly.

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.821
So if I don't like that I've
given this app permission,

00:06:13.821 --> 00:06:14.488
I can change it.

00:06:14.488 --> 00:06:15.612
That's really, really cool.

00:06:15.612 --> 00:06:17.710
It certainly just makes
for a much friendlier user

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.099
experience, which is great.

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:21.140
Now one of the other things
that I really enjoyed

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.239
was the Doze, which
is a nice name.

00:06:24.239 --> 00:06:26.530
Because I have exactly the
scenario that you mentioned.

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:28.738
I have a tablet, and I'll
sometimes leave the tablet.

00:06:28.738 --> 00:06:30.805
And maybe I didn't
close the cover right

00:06:30.805 --> 00:06:33.430
on the tablet or something like
that, and suddenly I come back,

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:34.619
and it's 20% battery left.

00:06:34.619 --> 00:06:35.410
That kind of stuff.

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:36.743
So Doze is really cool for that.

00:06:36.743 --> 00:06:38.880
DAVID BURKE: Yeah, it's
kind of trading off.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.255
Android's pretty
amazing at that.

00:06:40.255 --> 00:06:42.560
It's sort of almost
overoptimized in freshness.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.399
Everything's always
the latest information.

00:06:44.399 --> 00:06:46.440
But I think what we realized
was that, especially

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:50.400
for the tablet use cases, users
were actually willing to have,

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.720
it's OK if it's out of
date for, like, 10 seconds.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.170
I'd rather that, but my
tablet lasts twice as long.

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:58.080
And so the idea with
Doze is basically

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.580
we use significant
motion detection

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.370
to detect if the device has
been left alone for a long time.

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:05.310
And then we start
exponentially backing off.

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:07.480
Basically it'll go asleep,
wake up for a little bit,

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.810
then it will go asleep for
a longer period of time,

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:09.930
wake up for a
little bit, and then

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:11.513
go asleep for a
longer period of time.

00:07:11.513 --> 00:07:12.290
So it backs off.

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:15.877
And what that does is it reduces
the standby current that's

00:07:15.877 --> 00:07:16.960
been drawn on the battery.

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.980
And so it will extend the
battery life significantly.

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.325
So we're seeing--
and we mentioned

00:07:20.325 --> 00:07:22.408
this in the keynote-- we're
seeing up to two times

00:07:22.408 --> 00:07:25.735
longer in standby if you
just leave the devices alone.

00:07:25.735 --> 00:07:27.610
And so we're still
working on it, by the way.

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:28.020
That's the other
thing to remember.

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:29.170
This is a preview, really.

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:30.129
This is not launched.

00:07:30.129 --> 00:07:32.170
And so we're still tweaking
and making it better.

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:34.210
But initial results are
looking really good.

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:35.760
LAURENCE MORONEY: For a preview
it still looks pretty good.

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:36.850
DAVID BURKE: Yeah,
we're pretty happy.

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:38.260
LAURENCE MORONEY:
It's kind of solid.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:38.860
So it's cool.

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:41.110
So then one of the other
things you were talking about

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:41.840
was Type-C USB?

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:42.160
DAVID BURKE: Right.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:42.590
LAURENCE MORONEY:
And we're beginning

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:44.910
to see that in lots
of places now, right?

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:45.660
DAVID BURKE: Yeah.

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:47.044
The number one,
actually, it think

00:07:47.044 --> 00:07:48.502
it was like the
biggest cheer I got

00:07:48.502 --> 00:07:50.670
was for not having to do this.

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:52.672
Which side is it?

00:07:52.672 --> 00:07:54.630
So because USB Type-C,
of course, is flippable.

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:56.124
It's symmetric, right?

00:07:56.124 --> 00:07:58.790
And so we've been working with a
bunch of manufacturers and sort

00:07:58.790 --> 00:07:59.456
of helping this.

00:07:59.456 --> 00:08:01.790
We actually had a lot
of people in Google work

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:03.510
on the standards for
USB Type-C. So it's

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:05.260
something we've been
very heavily involved

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.560
with from the very start.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:09.500
And it's got a couple
other nice features.

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:12.800
You can run DisplayPort
over it for VideoEdge

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.060
if the device supports that.

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:16.290
You can charge
much more quickly.

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:19.530
So basically what you do, rather
than the old school USB being,

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:22.180
like, 5 volts and relatively
low current, now what you do

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:23.680
is you actually
step the voltage up.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.280
And you have higher
current and voltage there

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.029
for higher powers.

00:08:26.029 --> 00:08:28.310
You can charge more quickly.

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:30.720
Like up to three times
faster, which is pretty cool.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.970
And then we had to do a
couple little tweaks to the OS

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:35.544
because you might have,
like, a phablet and a tablet.

00:08:35.544 --> 00:08:36.960
And you plug them
into each other.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:37.950
Who's charging who?

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:40.789
And so you can now choose the
direction of the current flows.

00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:42.330
LAURENCE MORONEY:
That was the thing.

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:43.570
I never even thought
of that scenario

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:45.695
where I could use my tablet
to charge my phone if I

00:08:45.695 --> 00:08:47.500
need to make a phone call.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:48.542
I was like, kind of cool.

00:08:48.542 --> 00:08:50.666
Because I usually carry
one of those little battery

00:08:50.666 --> 00:08:52.390
packs as well as my
tablet and my phone.

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:54.820
But now I can get rid
of that stuff I need to.

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:56.590
That's pretty cool stuff.

00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:58.270
So much stuff that
you're announced.

00:08:58.270 --> 00:08:59.380
And it's only a preview.

00:08:59.380 --> 00:08:59.900
DAVID BURKE: Right.

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:00.730
LAURENCE MORONEY:
So I'm sure there's

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:01.970
a whole lot more good stuff.

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:03.710
And I know we can't
talk about it now,

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:07.380
but I'd encourage folks to go
out and download the preview.

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:08.650
Have a play with it.

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:10.536
Download the SDKs when
they're available.

00:09:10.536 --> 00:09:12.160
Have a play with
Developing for Android

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.570
M. And any last
messages on Android M?

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:15.070
Any last--

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:15.736
DAVID BURKE: No.

00:09:15.736 --> 00:09:17.080
Please do exactly what you said.

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.080
Download it, try it out.

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.550
Find some bugs, file some bugs.

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:21.726
We want to fix as many
things as possible.

00:09:21.726 --> 00:09:22.600
Try the new features.

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.410
And like you said, there's lots
of things we can talk about

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:25.118
that we've added.

00:09:25.118 --> 00:09:26.760
Bluetooth stylus
support, MIDI support,

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.890
there's just a bunch
of really cool things.

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:29.670
LAURENCE MORONEY:
There's MIDI support?

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:31.003
DAVID BURKE: MIDI support, yeah.

00:09:31.003 --> 00:09:33.650
So you can plug
your drum kit in.

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:35.006
So rock out on M.

00:09:35.006 --> 00:09:36.130
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK, cool.

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:37.295
So thanks very much, Dave.

00:09:37.295 --> 00:09:39.440
And thanks, everybody,
for watching.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:42.520
Go ahead, download
Android M Preview today.
