&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.270
&gt;&gt; Joan Weeks: Good afternoon
ladies and gentlemen and welcome

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.410 position:56%
to the African and Middle East
Division of the Library of Congress.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.540
Today's lecture on the
discovery of Karamanlidika:

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.310
Disappearing Literature,
Artifacts and Cultural Heritage

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:43.340
by Selenay Aytac and Constantia
Constantinou is sponsored

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.200
by the Near East Section of the
African and Middle East Division.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.010
I'm Joan Weeks, head of
the Near East Section.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.000
On behalf of all my colleagues and
in particular Dr. Mary-Jane Deeb

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.010
who unfortunately can't be with us
today, she's chief of the division,

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.260
I'd like to welcome you to our
very special program today.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.090
But before we get started I always
like to give a brief overview

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.330
of the division and in the
hopes that you'll come back

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.350
to use our collections
for your research.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.140
This division is comprised
of three sections that build

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.950
and serve our collections to
researchers from around the world.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.380
We cover 78 countries and
more than 35 languages.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.240
The Africa Section includes all the
countries of Sub-Saharan Africa.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.630
The Hebraic Section is responsible
for Judaica and Hebraica worldwide

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.660 position:56%
and the Near East Section covers all

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.170
of the Arab countries including
North Africa, Turkey, Iran,

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.240
Afghanistan, Central Asia, the
Muslims in Western China, Russia,

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.410
the Balkans and the
peoples of the Caucasus,

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.120
so you see we encompass
a very wide region.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.430
After the program we'd invite you
to fill in the evaluation forms

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.100
that you see on your chairs,
if you could kindly do that.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:09.030
We like to see how we're
doing with our programs.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.560
And also we have a little brochure
about our 4 Corners Blog posts.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.850
We like to promote those to
enhance the ability for researchers

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.320
around the world to know what
we have here in our collections.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.840
And also, I'd just
quickly remind you

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.740
that our program today is being
videotaped so if you ask questions,

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:38.610
just implicitly you're giving your
permission so please don't hesitate

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.590
but just to be aware that
it is being recorded.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.330
So, now I'd like to
introduce our speakers,

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.400
Dr. Selenay Aytac is
an Associate Professor

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.620
at Long Island University
and a Fulbright Scholar.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.670
She just finished her
Fulbright Scholarship

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.590
so that's quite an accomplishment.

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.920
She conducted her doctoral research
in the field of bibliometrics.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.520
That's a very esoteric
field to say the least

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.380
and she studied scholarly
communication

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.860
and the behavior of
Turkish scientists.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.810
She's also interested
in user studies,

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.340
particularly serving
diverse student groups

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.530
such as international
students in academic libraries.

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.950
And Dr. Constantia Constantinou
is Dean of University Libraries

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.720
at Stoney Brook University in New
York and also a Fulbright Scholar.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.510
And she's published and presented
her research on topics ranging

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.820
from organizational performance,
information of literacy,

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.510
information systems, library
technology, digital preservation,

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.070
scholarly communication, so you
can see she's had a wide range

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.220
of interests.

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.750
And she's an established
public speaker.

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.590
She's been invited to present her
research at library conferences

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:03.640
in the United States and worldwide
including China, Cyprus, Finland,

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.960
France, Greece, Turkey, Korea,
Russia, Ukraine, Croatia,

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.120
Hong Kong, Spain, it goes on.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.720
So, Constantia is always
co-editor of the book

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.280 position:56%
"International Librarianship:
Developing Professional Interculture

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.510
and Educational Leadership".

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:27.510 position:56%
Please help me welcome Doctors Aytac
and Constantinou to the podium.

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.500
[ Applause ]

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.460
&gt;&gt; Constantia Constantinou:
Good afternoon everyone,

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.180
what a pleasure to be here.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.640
Thank you for your hospitality and
for the great honor to invite us

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.310
to the Library of Congress,
the Division of African

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:55.790
and Middle Eastern Division
to present our research.

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:59.000
My name is Constantia and
I'm delighted to be here

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.620
with my colleague Selenay
though we met accidentally

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.650
when I was finishing my
Fulbright coming from Cyprus

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.530
and she was getting ready to go
to Turkey to start her Fulbright

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:19.630
on the same research topic that
we both had fallen in love with.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:25.190
Our research topic is on the
discovery of Karamanlidika.

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:31.210
To paraphrase a scholar by the name
of Matthias Kappler from his book

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.760
"A Tale of Two Languages:
Tracing the History of Turkish

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:42.960
and Greek Language", no
society is purely monolingual

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:49.280
and no human expression of art
or communication is monocultural

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.320
and this is what Selenay
and I came to discover

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.370
in our respective countries
and cultures.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:03.720
The outline of our presentation
will talk about the origins

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:10.070
of Karamanlidika, Karamanlidika
terminology, our Fulbright projects

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:16.240
and what brought us into this kind
of research, the people of Cyprus

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:21.330
as have been divided and
reunited in their own cultures,

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:31.180 position:56%
the Karamanlidika digital library
that Selenay's project is addressing

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:36.650
and some recommendations that
we, came from our research.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:43.620
The origins of Karamanlidika
and Karamanlides

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:50.090
and the Karamanli people
started from 1071

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:52.460
when Turks began to
settle in Anatolia.

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:57.940
And the indigenous population of
Anatolia spoke and wrote Greek

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.090
and they were Greek Orthodox.

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:04.330
But nevertheless Turks
did not call them Greek

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.570 position:56%
but they followed the Arab tradition

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:11.610
of calling them 'Rum'
which meant Romans.

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:15.870
And among this community
there was a group of Turkish

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:19.020
who wrote in Greek alphabet.

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:25.950
They lived in places in Anatolia
such as Karaman region, Konya,

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:35.910
Mersin, Silike, Kayseri, Yozgat,
Ankara and later because of trade

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:39.020
and economy some of them
settled in the cities

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:44.450
such as Trabzan, Izmir
and Instanbul.

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:54.170
This shaded map shows the area
of Karaman in relation to Turkey,

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:57.390
Greece, Cyprus and
Mykonos [phonetic].

00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:00.670
And the next map gives us a better.

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:04.860
It's a historical map, a better
understanding where the region is

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:07.420
by name and shading of colors.

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:11.470
The Karaman region is the Greek
region right in the middle

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:15.430
of Anatolia above Cyprus.

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:20.910
Now, there are two theories
about the Karaman leaders.

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:23.490
The Karaman leaders were descended

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:29.210
from religiously-converted
Turkish soldiers, the Turcopoles,

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:33.190
that Byzantine emperors
settled in Anatolia.

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:36.430
And another theory that seems to
be a little more convincing is

00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:39.500
that the Karaman leaders
are the direct descendants

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:41.720
of Byzantine Greeks.

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:45.960
Despite their linguistic
Turkification they maintain their

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:50.390
Greek Orthodox faith and we
find some of those elements

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:52.630
from a 19th century linguist

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:57.030
who travelled throughout the
Karamanlides- speaking regions

00:08:57.030 --> 00:09:01.720
of Cappadocia and documented a
few of the remaining Greek words

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:05.880
that mostly the elderly
people spoke.

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:11.660
Karamanlides did not adapt the
Greek national identity of the time

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:15.760
but they preferred instead
to be called Rum, the Romans,

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:19.000
Christians of Christian Anatolia.

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:27.370
&gt;&gt; Selenay Aytac: Karamanlides
is one

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:32.390
of the many interesting
communities in need of the creation

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:36.660
of a niche personal community
knowledge environment

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:41.000
and an archetype for
similar conceptualization.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.070
If we summarize what Constantia
just briefly mentioned,

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:50.620
Karamanlides also known
Karamanli people are those

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:54.670
who spoke Ottoman Turkish
and wrote in Greek characters

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:59.050
in Asia Minor during the
rule of the Ottoman Empire.

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:04.640
The Karamanli Turkish community has
been forced to leave the country

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:08.580
in accord with the 1923
Mubadele [inaudible]

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:13.910
so there is no more Karamanli
community left in Turkey anymore

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:18.930
and the cultural artifacts, all the
Karamanlides artifacts scattered

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:24.790
over the worldwide web are the
only evidence of their existence.

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:33.280 position:56%
If we just look into the language
discourse again Karamanli Turkish is

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:37.910
spoken Ottoman Turkish
and recent Greek.

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:42.330
If we just go into Ottoman
Turkish case we see Ottoman Turkish

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:48.900 position:56%
and Arabic [inaudible] and for Greek
is Greek spoken and Greek written.

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:53.220
So for the case of Karamanli
Turkish we see the combination

00:10:53.220 --> 00:11:00.310
of a little bit changed Greek
alphabet manipulated just

00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:04.010
to give some of the sounds
that Ottoman Turkish has

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:07.950
and spoken purely Ottoman Turkish.

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:12.740
And if you refer the
same scientist again,

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:15.600
the same scholar Mattias Kappler,

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:19.870
he pointed out that no individual
is perfectly monolingual.

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:25.350
No society is purely monocultural
and no human expression of arts

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:31.350
or any type of communication is
free from any external influence.

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:33.400
So, works that were published

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:38.200
in Ottoman Turkish using Greek
script are called Karamanlidika

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:41.680
or Karamanli Turkish
is the great example

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:47.850
of what scholar Kappler
mentioned, discussed in his works.

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:50.140
And works that are published

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:55.630
in Ottoman Turkish using Greek
scripts are the great example

00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:59.740
of this cross-cultural concern

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:04.360
and it is exchanging
between two cultures.

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:14.880
And if I go back to my digital
library project we see that the aim

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:19.480
of the project was the discovery
of Karamanlides artifacts

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:24.310
but not just discovery of these
artifacts but also the reconnecting

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:29.190
of peoples to their cultural
heritage and their lost memories

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:33.200
by a digital platform,
a digital library.

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:38.920
And it was not just a digital
library project to start with,

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:43.740
one of the aims, objectives of
this project was to facilitate

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:45.220
in the long-term of course,

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:49.340
genealogy research among
these dispersed peoples

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:53.670
and common understanding of
cultural heritage, common cities

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:58.870 position:56%
and shared countries such as Cyprus,
a country that remains divided

00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:03.320
between Greek and Turkish Cypriots.

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:08.390
My methodology, the first step was

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:14.490
to identify available digital
Karamanlides cultural artifacts via

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:15.790
social media tools.

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:21.390
So I used Facebook, Twitter and
YouTube and I used some key words

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:25.780
to find, retrieve some Karamanlides

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:30.270
and pinpoint the useful
metadata for such a project.

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:33.730
And the next step focused
on the analysis

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:40.030
of these user-created,
generated metadata.

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:42.090
And based on the findings

00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:47.620 position:56%
of this study we found many
Karamanlides artifacts scattered all

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:55.440
over the worldwide web and most of
them lacking descriptive metadata.

00:13:55.440 --> 00:14:08.310
Now I have a schema here if you can
see some of the artifacts listed.

00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:13.300
Two artifacts retrieved by
Twitter and three of them

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:17.690
from Facebook and two from YouTube.

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:23.740
The first one is a book title
page of a book, a monograph,

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:29.640
found on Twitter by using
the key word, 'Karamanlidika'

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:32.840
and the date is clearly visible.

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:37.630
The date was 1784 and of course not

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:41.460
so much information on
this Twitter, tweet.

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:47.310 position:56%
There is no information about
location and there is no translation

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:50.590
but in some cases you see that
there is a transliterational

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:53.230
Karamanlidika here.

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:59.720
And the second artifact I gathered
via Twitter was an inscriptive

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:03.770
stone, entry of the building and
of course we didn't have the date

00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:07.580
or any information about this.

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:12.250
It was just a picture
of an inscriptive stone

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:15.430
with Karamanlidika on it.

00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:21.900
And some other data gathered
from Facebook discussion groups,

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:26.480
Facebook is a great platform that
many people they get together

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:31.640
and they join to these groups and
they discuss the different images

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.540
and different surrogates.

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:35.320
They talk about the language.

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:41.990
They transliterate and they discuss
about the resources they upload

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:43.710
on these Facebook groups.

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:48.050
This one was also from
Cyprus [inaudible].

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:55.260
The person who took the picture
of this inscriptive stone,

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.560
entry of the house put the place

00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:00.920
that it's taken at
Cyprus and the dates.

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:05.700
We guessed it's from 1900.

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:11.420
And this individual used the tags
'Karamanice' and 'Karamanlilar'.

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:17.060
These are two popular tags
used among Turkish researchers.

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:20.880
Turkish historians, they
use these Turkish tags.

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:23.270
And the next one was a photograph,

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:26.480
again found through these
Facebook discussion groups

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:29.530
and they use the tags
'Karamanlidika' and 'Karamanlilar'

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:32.360
so it was easier to
retrieve this one

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:34.930
with the common key words we use.

00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:39.670
And it was the picture of an
orphanage from Cappadocia.

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:45.510
It's [inaudible] the current
region and it was suspected

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:51.470
that the date, it's 1911 or 1912.

00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:55.130
And we found another
picture from Kayseri,

00:16:55.130 --> 00:17:00.450
that we see a family picture,
five people altogether.

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:06.620
And it's also dated 1924 and a
relative post of this picture.

00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:08.480
They are family photographs.

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:13.130 position:56%
And they posted the picture and they
pointed that they are family members

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:16.840
and they look forward to if anybody
else knows the other relatives

00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:20.780
or neighbors, information
about them.

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:26.130
And also we used YouTube to
find some other artifacts

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:31.620
and we found one oral
interview and one song.

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:36.740
And the oral interview
conducted in 2013

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:43.600
and she remembers how her relatives
came from Turkey and how they spoke

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:49.910
and how they sang and all the
information about the homeland

00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:51.840
and the village they leave.

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:55.430
So, she had all this information
in this oral interview.

00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:58.530
And she also had some
of the artifacts remain

00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:01.020
from her grandmother that
they brought together,

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:04.150
some of the cooking utensils,
some other kitchen stuff.

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:08.960
So these are two great pieces
that we gathered from YouTube.

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:20.080
And if we go back to the digital
library prototype we presented

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:22.340
with the four-layer system.

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:26.330
And the first one we see
the content, metadata

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:29.210
and the second one is
system and network,

00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:32.860 position:56%
users and the management and policy.

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:36.270
In the content metadata
area we propose

00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:42.040 position:56%
that with this digital library users
can upload all the artifacts they

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:48.980
house in their family archives or
any other photographs they've taken

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:50.790
in these unique villages.

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:52.790
And they can just upload those

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:55.010
and they can also undertake
the information

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:58.870
about the Karamanlides artifacts.

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:04.280
And this proposed system
will store and will also help

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:11.410
to retrieve all these artifacts
and by using Control Vocabulary.

00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:16.320
And in terms of users, users
are wearing multiple hats.

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:19.900
They are not just users, they
are also uploading their family

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:23.570
archives, their personal
archives about Karamanlidika.

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:25.760
And in the meantime
they are undertaking,

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:30.930 position:56%
they are sharing their information
about these pieces and communicating

00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:33.370
with other users and researchers.

00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:38.960
And this proposed digital library
will also have some guidelines

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:44.560
and it's hoped that it will
also house mounted exhibitions

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:48.560
that anyone can come and
visit this digital library

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:52.710
and see monthly uploaded
Karamanlidika artifacts

00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:56.900
and they can see them.

00:19:56.900 --> 00:20:02.160
So, I just have an example of an
Entity Relationship Diagram here.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:05.630
You see the Karamanlidika
is the most popular key word

00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:07.770
but in some cases like in

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:13.530
that uploaded Facebook picture
they may use Karamanice.

00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:14.880
They may use Karamanli.

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.980
They may use Karamanlilar.

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:21.950
But of course we will use this
authoritative entry Karamanlidika

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:26.820
and Karamanlides for
these resources.

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:31.070
Libraries, archives and museums

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:35.700
and other memory institutions
were the primary keepers

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:39.140
of cultural artifacts
before the invention

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:43.380
of the worldwide web
especially Web 2.0.

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:48.540
With the emergence of social media
everything is radically changed

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:51.360
and enhanced and the
public they start

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:55.030
to disseminate their
cultural heritage directly

00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:58.190
and therefore they bypass
the memory institution

00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:05.400
so such a digital library project
may be a good venue environment

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:11.490
that they can share all the
cultural artifacts they have.

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:15.250
So, it's also hoped that
this proposed digital library

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:20.020
with the project will be also the
cultural glue that creates bones

00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:25.750
and cultural knowledge frame for
a cohesive Karamanlides community

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:28.680
in this distributed environment.

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:33.520
And it's hoped that this will also
facilitate genealogy research among

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:39.450
these dispersed people and common
understanding of cultural heritage,

00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:43.970
common space and their shared
countries such as Cyprus

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:47.820
as we mentioned previously.

00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:53.270 position:56%
And it's also hoped that
Karamanlides will be a good example,

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:58.100
this digital library will be a good
example to some other communities

00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:04.840
which are in similar need for the
creation of a digital library.

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:12.200
So, we talk about all these
cultural artifacts and families

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:18.340 position:56%
and the researchers holding these
resources in their personal archives

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:21.520
and how about the Karamanlidika
monographs.

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:26.950
They are also dispersed all over
the world and they are housed

00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:30.440
in a variety of libraries
and repositories.

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:34.460
And I have some examples here.

00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:39.860
That's one of the Karamanlidika
books.

00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:42.560
This is a famous song.

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:46.760
It's [inaudible] Yri
Sevdali Sarki on the top

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:52.870
and at the bottom the lyrics
of a very famous Turkish song.

00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:55.670
Probably you heard
about [inaudible].

00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:57.480
I was wondering you know if
you heard about [inaudible].

00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:59.510
It reads as:

00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:12.040
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:17.040
So this is the first
part of this famous song.

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:20.300
So this is from the
Yri Sevdali Sarki,

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:27.900
an example of how Karamanlidika
was in those monographs.

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:34.140
And I have another example
of this special culture here.

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:35.870
This is the [foreign
language spoken].

00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:41.930
When you read do you see that
this is the special documentation

00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:48.980
of this special serving machine
purchase by a Karamanlides family.

00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:50.770
And you see that this is coming

00:23:50.770 --> 00:23:52.070
from [foreign language spoken]
It's [foreign language spoken]

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:56.430
and all the details about
this particular purchase done

00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:57.820
by this family.

00:23:57.820 --> 00:24:04.580
And I have another example,
the entrance of this monograph.

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:11.410
On the top you see the
Karamanlidika entrance

00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:18.570
and you see the transliteration
at the bottom.

00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:21.890
And when you read, when you
transliterate so this is something

00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:23.360
as similar we would like to do

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:28.320
in the digital library whenever we
upload a Karamanlidika document we

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:31.520
would like to see the
transliteration so anyone can read

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:35.610
and understand the content or
description of the artifact.

00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:37.510
We have:

00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:59.250
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:24:59.250 --> 00:25:07.570
&gt;&gt; Constantia Constantinou: So
in 2010 I returned to Cyprus

00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:13.160
for my second Fulbright
and my objective then was

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:18.100
to bring these bi-communal
societies of the Turkish

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:20.090
and the Greek Cypriots
closer to each other

00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:22.600
in understanding each
other's language

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:25.150
from the library's perspective.

00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:32.220 position:56%
Cyprus has always, always since
1960s had a U.N. presence as you see

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:36.220
in some of these pictures but
the communities lived together

00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:41.250
until 1974 when there was
a division of the island.

00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:46.760
My work with the librarians from
the Cypriot Turkish universities

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:48.970
and the Greek Turkish
universities that you see

00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:54.840
in these pictures was very
collaborative, was very trusting.

00:25:54.840 --> 00:26:01.730
It was very engaging until the two
communities came together to begin

00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:05.130
to realize the commonalities
of their cultures,

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:13.300 position:56%
their languages [inaudible] as well
as their professions, librarianship.

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:15.190
Trust was built to the point

00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:19.010
where we opened each other's
special collections to discover

00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:21.500
in those collections
the Karamanlidika book

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:23.980
that I was seeing for
the first time.

00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:29.060
Some examples of those books are
here from their special collections

00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:33.690
and for me to realize for the first
time these two cultures coming

00:26:33.690 --> 00:26:38.550
together in sound in Turkish
Ottoman words with a Greek spelling

00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:42.510
of the titles and the
text of the books.

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:49.250
Some of the elements of
the Karamanlidika book is

00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:55.580
of course the special dots that
you see over the Greek letters

00:26:55.580 --> 00:27:00.640
to indicate their Turkish
pronunciation of those words

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:03.420
and of course Arabic calligraphy
such as [foreign language spoken]

00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:08.910
of Sultans of the Sultans
sealed on the books.

00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:11.540
This particular book,
it was published

00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:21.020
in Istanbul [foreign language
spoken] in I think in 1877

00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:24.420
by an Armenian publisher.

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:28.990
So we see more than just one
culture or identity come together.

00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:31.960
There is the Arabic
script and the Greek

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:34.260
and Turkish pronunciations
of these books.

00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:39.310
Now, my colleague will talk a
little bit more about how we would

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:44.570
like to see these books depicted
into our catalogues and our ability

00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:47.740
to discover them through
our systems.

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:52.880
&gt;&gt; Selenay Aytac: So, some of
these monographs are housed

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:55.700
in our libraries.

00:27:55.700 --> 00:28:00.420
We search WorldCat and we analyzed.

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:04.740
We [inaudible] descriptions of
some of these Karamanli works

00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:08.150
or the manifestations
of Karamanlidika.

00:28:08.150 --> 00:28:14.290 position:56%
So, we found Karamanlidika surrogate
records for Karamanlidika works

00:28:14.290 --> 00:28:20.220 position:56%
in these libraries and we examined
some of those MARC records and would

00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:23.930
like to share our recommendations.

00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:30.220
One of the university libraries,
Bogazici University Library

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:36.100 position:56%
from Istanbul, Turkey where I had
my Fulbright research conducted is a

00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:41.570
good place for many Karamanli
[inaudible] resources

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:45.840
and this is one of the
Karamanlidika works

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:50.600
that you can see the
bibliographic records.

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:55.990
And you see the title, this
is the "Tzinkiane Kizi"

00:28:55.990 --> 00:29:01.520
and they transliterate the title
and they put the, as you see,

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:03.600
the publishing information.

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:08.030
But the only information in
the surrogate records indicates

00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:13.770
that this is a Karamanlidika work
is the subject heading the '650

00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:15.070
field' here.

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:22.110
It's Turkish language in Karamanli
and so this is how it describes

00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:24.720
so if you're looking
for Karamanlidika

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:26.870
in Worldcat you will not be able

00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:31.780 position:56%
to retrieve these bibliographic
records nor you will be able to know

00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:36.560
that Bogazici Library
has a great collection

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:40.000
of Karamanlidika monographs.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.870
Another example is from
the Library of Congress.

00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:48.420
And this is the newer edition

00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:50.490
of a Karamanlidika work
[foreign language spoken].

00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:52.570
It's a well-known work.

00:29:52.570 --> 00:29:59.850
It's first published in
Karamanlidika but then later

00:29:59.850 --> 00:30:09.510
on in 1986 they republished
and here you see

00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:14.640
that there is title
information in notes area.

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:17.820
We see the Roman transcription
of the original Turkish

00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:24.240
in Greek script published as
[foreign language spoken] Istanbul

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:30.020
so we see the date of the original
work but, and look at the subject.

00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:35.900
It [inaudible] Turkish civilization
19th century in 651 MARC field

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:39.710
but we don't see anything about
Karamanlidika or Karamanlides.

00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:44.380
Usually when you're looking for
Karamanlidika monographs you look

00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:46.940
for the key word Karamanlidika

00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:50.820
so here again we do
not have any indication

00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:57.880
of the mostly-used key words in
the record nor a subject heading.

00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:02.200
Another surrogate record
is from a British library

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:09.010
and this is also another
Karamanlidika work

00:31:09.010 --> 00:31:15.530
in 245 we see has written
[foreign language spoken] so we see

00:31:15.530 --> 00:31:20.500
that this is also published
in Constantinople in 1836

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:25.050
and we have some notes
fill in information.

00:31:25.050 --> 00:31:29.130
Again, information about the
language Karamanli to Turkish

00:31:29.130 --> 00:31:33.090
so this is how they describe
in the notes area Karamanli

00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:37.880
to Turkish written in Greek
letters Romanized in the normal way

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:42.970
and there is no subject
heading so we really don't see

00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:46.460
that any information
about the [inaudible]

00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:49.540
of this particular work either.

00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:55.700
So, our findings that results show
that published works representing

00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:59.280
of the Karamanli literature are
dispersed all over the world

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:03.840
in a variety of libraries and
repositories however due to lack

00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:08.220
of subject headings and Library of
Congress call numbers because some

00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:11.460
of these resources are
classified and housed

00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:13.560
in Turkish language sections,

00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:17.760
some of them in modern Greek
language sections and some

00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:20.090
of them are just waiting
to be catalogued.

00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:21.830 position:56%
So, due to lack of subject headings,

00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:24.330
the Library of Congress
call numbers,

00:32:24.330 --> 00:32:27.870
retrieving these works
is very problematic.

00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:31.020
And there is no specific
bibliographic description used

00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:34.180
for any of these Karamanli works.

00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:37.320
In most of the information
library catalogues

00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:42.820
as you saw the surrogate records,
they only use the notes area.

00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:45.640
So our recommendations for
our colleagues at the Library

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:49.890
of Congress LC subject
heading, call number

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:53.710
and perhaps the language code.

00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:58.380
We didn't mention that but usually
they use a 'tu' language code

00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:02.280
for Turkish for all these
Karamanlidika works.

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:05.070
In some cases they
use the Greek codes

00:33:05.070 --> 00:33:09.800
so we should be establishing
a new one for Karamanlidika.

00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:15.150
And if I just summarize by
creating a new subject heading

00:33:15.150 --> 00:33:21.500 position:56%
for Karamanlidika or Karamanlides
we can organize all these monographs

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:27.480 position:56%
under one subject heading and we
can make all the researchers' access

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:30.860
much easier to the
Karamanlidika works.

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:32.160
&gt;&gt; Constantia Constantinou:

00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:38.910
And we would like to conclude
our presentation with this image

00:33:38.910 --> 00:33:41.970
and a sound bite of a song.

00:33:41.970 --> 00:33:43.670
These are Karamanlides.

00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:46.860
As you see they're all gathered
together with instruments.

00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:52.650
There are Turkish flags and
they're singing the Karamanli song.

00:33:52.650 --> 00:34:02.180
Let me see if I can
get to this, great.

00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:06.300
So, today we spoke of
Karamanlides people, their culture,

00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:09.080
their language and their
literature as we have come

00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:11.930
to experience that
from our research.

00:34:11.930 --> 00:34:16.770
Our Fulbright assignments presented
the diversity and the commonalities

00:34:16.770 --> 00:34:22.110
of these two distinct cultures and
the Turkish and the Greek cultures

00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:26.990
and we believe that it
is our responsibility

00:34:26.990 --> 00:34:29.580
to preserve their cultures,
their records

00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:33.060
and to make them discoverable
through [inaudible]

00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:36.180 position:56%
of subject headings and descriptors.

00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:38.510
Thank you.

have some questions from anybody.

00:34:45.690 --> 00:34:47.850

some Karamanli books and also books

in Turkish [inaudible]

great, thank you very much.

&gt;&gt; Constantia Constantinou:
Michael, thank you again.

00:35:45.110 --> 00:35:55.090
Can you just tell us a little bit

00:35:55.090 --> 00:36:02.190
about the Armenian
Turkish literature?

00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:09.610
I'm not very much familiar
with that.

00:36:09.610 --> 00:36:23.080
&gt;&gt; Michael: I'm not the
one who is cataloguing it

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:28.340 position:56%
but the Armenian cataloguer does not
know Turkish so when he gets a book

00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:31.360
in Armenian script
and starts reading it

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:34.070 position:56%
and realizes that it's not Armenian.

00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:35.410
He brings it to us.

00:36:35.410 --> 00:36:38.220
Usually he brings it to Alan
[assumed spelling] [inaudible]

00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:41.000
and together they figure
out what it says.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.550
But we've also gotten a
couple of books in Kurdish

00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:50.380 position:56%
in the Armenian script, particularly
translations of the Bible

00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:54.910
and I often wonder who was
intended as the audience of that.

00:36:54.910 --> 00:37:01.500
I mean who would only
know the Armenian alphabet

00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:13.690
but speak Kurdish in 1875.

00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:20.650
It's a bit of a mystery.

00:37:20.650 --> 00:37:30.780
I mean who was the
intended audience?

00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:37.030 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Constantia Constantinou: That was
my experience too when I was working

00:37:40.890 --> 00:37:47.900
with the rare book collections
of my Turkish Cypriot libraries

00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:51.440
and my colleagues presented
me with those books

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:53.840
as if here, you speak Greek.

00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:58.390
You understand Greek and
you could read what it said.

00:37:58.390 --> 00:38:01.590
And I started reading
it and I was listening

00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:08.000
to my Turkish pronunciation
of Allah, the great God

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.240
and I did not understand
a word I was reading

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:12.110
but they understood
everything of course, yeah.

00:38:12.110 --> 00:38:14.380
&gt;&gt; Michael: Oh but I mean it was
known [inaudible] it was known

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:19.120
that they spoke Turkish but
wrote it in the Greek script.

00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:24.390

spoke Kurdish but wrote it

[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:42.200
&gt;&gt; Selenay Aytac: Yes, some of
the oral interviews conducted,

00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:46.320
it was in Greece and after the
Mubadele they went to Greece

00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:49.810 position:56%
and different places and some of
them they came to the United States.

00:38:49.810 --> 00:38:53.650
This is how I think she met
some of the grandchildren

00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:55.170
so they dispersed all
over the world.

00:38:55.170 --> 00:38:57.460
And I'm also a member
of this Facebook group.

00:38:57.460 --> 00:38:59.450
It's called Scattered
Greeks that they talk

00:38:59.450 --> 00:39:02.340
about their great-great parents
and their families and they try

00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:07.050
to learn more about their
transcendental homelands that,

00:39:10.210 --> 00:39:29.150
they've never been there but
the only image in their head is

00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:39.860
through their grandmas' stories.

00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:41.300
But they talk about these places
and they know the villages

00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:42.600
that they're born but they've
never been to Turkey either.

00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:43.940
So, just like this summer we
met some of the researchers

00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:45.240
from Australia and New Zealand.

00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:46.540
They were planning to come to
Turkey to see the land that some

00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:48.020
of their great parents they mention
and they talk about the Gallipoli

00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:49.320
and so I think they're
all over the world.

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:50.620
I also met some Australian
Greeks that they are looking

00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:51.920
for some information about
their family roots in Anatoli,

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:53.220
so I think they're
all over the world.

00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:54.520
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker:
I'm just fascinated

00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:55.820
with your digital library project

00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:57.120
and I see how you're using
transliterations [inaudible] one

00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:58.420
of the most difficult things
with putting them together

00:39:58.420 --> 00:39:59.720
of digital library
[inaudible] different scripts

00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:01.020
or [inaudible] field to
put things in Arabic,

00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:02.320
Chinese [inaudible] languages and
I think we're not there with Greek

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:03.620
yet in the cataloguing process.

00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:04.920
So could you describe some of your
efforts [inaudible] digitalize?

00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:06.220
&gt;&gt; Selebay Aytac: Yes, this is
just in the preparation stage yet

00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:07.520
and of course we cannot propose
an automated system because it's

00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:08.820 position:56%
such a special language and requires
a special skill of transliteration

00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:10.120
as you all appreciate that you need
two experts just like in the case

00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:11.420
of Armenian correctors and
Turkish, you need both knowledge

00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:12.720
of Armenian letters,
knowledge of Ottoman Turkish,

00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:14.020
not the regular Turkish because
the Turkish they speak right now,

00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:15.320
currently, is also different.

00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:16.620
They had the language revolution.

00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:21.770
A lot of words have been left
behind so you really need someone

00:40:21.770 --> 00:40:27.170
who can speak the Turkish of that
time that they created those words.

00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:31.960
So you need multiple language
expertise so it's almost impossible

00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:34.350
to create such an automated system.

00:40:34.350 --> 00:40:41.460
So the proposed library will
have users wearing multiple hats

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:45.520
[inaudible] and uploading the
images of Karamanlidika works

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:49.780
and then transliterating
by themselves in the system

00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:52.430
with the help of some other users.

00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:58.170
So this is the plan for
the system and it's still

00:40:58.170 --> 00:41:01.970
in the process of working.

00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:10.510

00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:37.890
and the architecture
of the digital library

00:41:37.890 --> 00:41:42.230
but we didn't complete
any technical work yet.

00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:48.150
So, and the Bogazici University
was a great host and they hosted me

00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:50.820
and I spent there my
Fulbright research

00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:54.100
and they had two scholars,
researchers.

00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:57.220
They helped me to put
the webpage together just

00:41:57.220 --> 00:42:00.520
to disseminate the information
because you can surprise

00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:03.180
that there are so many
people out there,

00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:04.790
they never heard of Karamanlidika.

00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:10.380
They don't know about these
hidden gems of literature.

00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:14.580
I mean we know about Turkish
literature, Ottoman literature,

00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:19.380
Greek, Armenian but we don't
know about these works created

00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:22.550 position:56%
in between those different cultures.

00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:27.070
So, the first stage was to really
disseminate what we're planning

00:42:27.070 --> 00:42:32.510
to do and gather support so the
technical part did not start yet

00:42:32.510 --> 00:42:36.120
and the plan is if everything
goes well with the university

00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:40.420
and the staff to apply for a
grant so we can hire people

00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:47.360 position:56%
to put the system together so we can
start uploading some family archives

00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:51.070
because I am also a Facebook
member of some of these groups

00:42:51.070 --> 00:42:55.040
that they have huge
documentation in their own houses

00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:57.010
and they don't know how to share.

00:42:57.010 --> 00:42:59.350
I mean we're all using Facebook.

00:42:59.350 --> 00:43:01.370
We post a lot of things.

00:43:01.370 --> 00:43:03.370
It just disappears in Facebook.

00:43:03.370 --> 00:43:06.610
The major problem in
Facebook in terms of sharing,

00:43:06.610 --> 00:43:11.800 position:56%
it's not really retrievable and if
you cannot retrieve what is in there

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:15.430
as you know, the main objective
of a library catalogue,

00:43:15.430 --> 00:43:18.860
it should be retrievable so
Facebook is not the best place

00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:21.120
so share those types of resources.

00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:24.470
So all these people they're
ready to share what they have

00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:27.980
at somewhere else,
on a better platform.

00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:30.120
So hopefully once we
have the funding

00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:33.910
and put the technical
system, digital library

00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:37.920
out there we will have many
people supporting the creation

00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:41.040
of this library.

00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:44.210
&gt;&gt; Constantia Constantinou: We also
came to know a lot of scholars,

00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:50.030
Greeks and Turks through a
conference that they hosted

00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:54.560
for a second time and there's a
publication of their essays called

00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:57.780
"Cries and Whispers
of Karamanlidika".

00:43:57.780 --> 00:44:02.490 position:56%
There were about 50 some scholars
who continue to do this kind of work

00:44:02.490 --> 00:44:05.120
and I think really their essays

00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:08.380
in that conference were extremely
eye-opening for both of us

00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:11.720
to realize that there is some true
scholarship there that we need

00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:15.910
to capture the history behind it.

00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:24.190
&gt;&gt; Joan Weeks: Thank you so
much, both of you [inaudible].

00:44:24.190 --> 00:44:26.370
[ Applause ]

00:44:26.370 --> 00:44:27.950
&gt;&gt; Constantia Constantinou:
Thank you.

00:44:27.950 --> 00:44:29.250
Thank you.

00:44:29.250 --> 00:44:32.780
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
