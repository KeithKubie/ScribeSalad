00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.280
is that Israel has disconnected

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.060
different cities and regions and geographies in Palestine,

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.540
the food practices that differ one place to the other.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.760
My name is Mirna Bamieh.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:23.620
I'm an artist,

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:24.120
a cook,

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.800
and founder of Palestine Hosting Society.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.320
Palestine Hosting Society is a live art project.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.820
It seeks to create a platform for people to

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.260
construct a relationship to geography,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.160
politics, history,

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.780
but through food.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.020
You have Israeli chefs dealing with our food culture

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.820
without actually knowing the backstory of those dishes.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.260
When you oppress that story,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.700
you are using food as a tool for oppression.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.680
After picking the topic or the city

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.680
that I want to delve more into

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.080
I go to the place

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.000
and I spend a month of two in that place

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.080
and I meet people.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.460
[The] pre-1948 Nakba generation —

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.720
the ones that have experienced

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.120
this very sudden rupture from the land,

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.280
and have moved all over the world.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.700
With them, food moved.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.840
But as well with them, food was forgotten.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.400
And I meet mothers as well,

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.640
to understand what dishes they still cook and they don't cook.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.960
But as well, I meet men.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.120
Whether in small shops in old cities, old restaurants.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.240
Most of the people that I interviewed were exiled.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.620
One of the dishes that I was happy

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.720
to put on the menu of the edible 
wild plants table was loof.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.640
It's a very Palestinian plant.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.100
Even the scientific name of it, Arum palaestinum,

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.480
it has “Palestine” in the name of it.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.620
So, loof is a poisonous plant when it's eaten

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.900
as it is straight from the land,

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.620
it numbs the mouth,

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.060
and it can even have more serious complications

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.160
if it was consumed without being treated.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.580
Our grandmothers knew how to treat that 
plant by curing it

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.820
with salt and olive oil

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.080
and then cooked over a long period of time.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.660
The recipes have this power of movement

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.580
that most of us Palestinians are not having.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.280
I discovered during my research,

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.300
bseset al-kharoub,

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.880
and bsese is a very, very old ancient dish.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.780
It's roasted semolina with olive oil, with carob molasses

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.680
and some people add tahini and sesame to it.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.040
It used to be the food that

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.760
travelers and pilgrims carry with them when they travel

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.680
because it has all this richness of 
nutrients and energy to it.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.860
Every table we create is very detailed.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.000
From the napkins that we have on the tables,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.840
from the center pieces,

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.140
from what we place the water in.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.340
When I present the menu,

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.740
I do the performance.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.480
It's the artist who becomes the vehicle

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.820
of transferring this knowledge on the table.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.780
They're not plated one by one

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.540
because I want to maintain this sharing aspect of food,

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.540
which is very much in our culture.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.780
For Palestinians as a farmer nation,

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.640
we always had this very intimate connection 
with the land.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.540
Our grandfathers knew the land really well.

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.880
It was their world.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.400
My generation are those that lost this knowledge.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.880
We're the generation that had to assimilate 
in their new places,

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.260
whether refugee camps,

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.480
whether outside of Palestine,

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.560
whether in new cities.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.000
The people who attend the tables of 
Palestine Hosting Society

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.580
are from different backgrounds.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.580
And with each new table,

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.940
we have new people who attend.

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.260
When we as Palestinians see our ingredients being sold

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.060
under the name of “Israeli” produce,

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.340
it's a very hard moment for us.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.260
Somehow it refreshes the trauma

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.960
of us losing the land,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.880
of us not having power over our existence.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:45.340
The land,

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.340
not the space that you live on,

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.540
but the place where you practice your being 
as a human being,

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.160
as a Palestinian,

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.120
as a culture,

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.380
as a lineage of ancestors.

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.900
And it's a story that we have to reclaim now

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.000
in the present,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.120
so we can pass it to the future.
