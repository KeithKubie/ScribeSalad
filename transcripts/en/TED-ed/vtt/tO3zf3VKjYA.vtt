00:00:05.264 --> 00:00:08.219
I would say to my 16-year-old self,

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:10.601
"Just trust that it will work out.

00:00:10.601 --> 00:00:14.957
I think, trust that if you keep doing what you're doing,

00:00:14.957 --> 00:00:19.627
have the confidence that the future will be fine."

00:00:19.627 --> 00:00:21.954
I think it's something

00:00:21.954 --> 00:00:24.833
that most 16-year-olds of today need to hear

00:00:24.833 --> 00:00:26.294
is that it's going to be okay,

00:00:26.294 --> 00:00:28.298
just, you know, strive for excellence,

00:00:28.298 --> 00:00:29.276
and try to do good,

00:00:29.276 --> 00:00:30.713
and it's going to work out.
