00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.980
In this session, we're going to
be talking about polymorphism.

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.510
Polymorphism means many forms.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.230
When two instances of the same
class exhibit different behavior,

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.650
that class is said to be polymorphic.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.560
For example, when a subclass
over rides a superclass method

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.500
in order to behave in a particular way,
that's polymorphism.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.980
We'll explore the use of
the keyword override more deeply

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.360
in order to see some
polymorphism in action.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.050
Let's get started.
