- [Voiceover] "Giovanna
usually takes bus B to work,

00:00:02.816 --> 00:00:06.564
"but now she thinks that bus
A gets her to work faster.

00:00:06.564 --> 00:00:09.424
"She randomized 50 workdays
between a treatment group

00:00:09.424 --> 00:00:10.780
"and a control group.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.140
"For each day from the
treatment group, she took bus A;

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.773
"and for each day from the
control group, she took bus B.

00:00:15.773 --> 00:00:19.513
"Each day she timed the
length of her drive."

00:00:19.513 --> 00:00:20.760
This is really interesting
what she did, it's very

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.910
important, she randomized
the 50 work days.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.693
Before she did this, instead
of just kinda waking up in

00:00:25.693 --> 00:00:29.300
the morning and just deciding
on her own which bus to take.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.238
Because humans are infamously
bad at being random.

00:00:32.238 --> 00:00:33.565
Even when we think we're being random,

00:00:33.565 --> 00:00:35.017
we're actually not that random.

00:00:35.017 --> 00:00:38.686
She might inadvertently be
taking bus A earlier in the week.

00:00:38.686 --> 00:00:40.777
Or maybe the commute times are shorter.

00:00:40.777 --> 00:00:43.542
Or maybe she inadvertently
takes bus A when

00:00:43.542 --> 00:00:45.442
the weather is better,
when there's less traffic.

00:00:45.442 --> 00:00:49.089
Remember, there's a natural
tendency for human beings

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:51.569
to want to confirm their hypothesis.

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:54.089
So, if she thinks that
bus A is faster maybe

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:56.865
she'll want to pick the days where she'll

00:00:56.865 --> 00:00:58.705
get data to confirm her hypothesis.

00:00:58.705 --> 00:01:01.940
It's really important that
she randomize the 50 workdays.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.030
What I could imagine she did
is maybe she wrote each of

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.483
the work days, the dates,
on a piece of paper.

00:01:06.483 --> 00:01:09.293
She would have 50 pieces of
paper and then she turned

00:01:09.293 --> 00:01:11.634
them all upside down or
maybe she closed her eyes

00:01:11.634 --> 00:01:13.509
and then she moved them
all over her table.

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:15.924
Then with her eyes closed
she randomly moved them to

00:01:15.924 --> 00:01:17.973
either the left or the right of the table.

00:01:17.973 --> 00:01:19.683
If they moved to the left
of the table then those are

00:01:19.683 --> 00:01:21.591
the days she'll take bus A,
if she moves them to the right

00:01:21.591 --> 00:01:23.779
of the table those are
the days she takes bus B.

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:28.043
That's how she can make sure
that this is truly random.

00:01:28.043 --> 00:01:31.125
So then they tell us, this is important,

00:01:31.125 --> 00:01:32.997
"The results of the experiment
showed that the median

00:01:32.997 --> 00:01:37.252
"travel duration for bus A
is eight minutes less than

00:01:37.252 --> 00:01:41.636
"the median travel duration for bus B."

00:01:41.636 --> 00:01:44.243
Or one way to think about, if we said,

00:01:44.256 --> 00:01:49.012
"The treatment group

00:01:49.672 --> 00:01:54.672
"median minus the control group median.

00:01:58.677 --> 00:02:00.955
"What would we get?"

00:02:00.955 --> 00:02:04.494
Well, the treatment group
is eight minutes less

00:02:04.494 --> 00:02:06.253
than the control group? Right?

00:02:06.253 --> 00:02:09.508
This is A, this is B, so if
this is eight less than this,

00:02:09.508 --> 00:02:12.555
then this is going to be
equal to negative eight.

00:02:12.555 --> 00:02:14.958
This is just another
way of restating what I

00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:17.060
have underlined right over here.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.394
Someone's car alarm went off,
hope you're not hearing that.

00:02:19.394 --> 00:02:20.371
Anyway, I'll try to pay
attention while it's

00:02:20.371 --> 00:02:22.031
going off (chuckles).

00:02:22.031 --> 00:02:23.954
"To test whether the
results could be explained

00:02:23.954 --> 00:02:27.229
"by random chance, she
created the table below,

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:31.505
"Which summarizes the results
of 1000 re-randomizations

00:02:31.505 --> 00:02:34.354
"of the data, with
differences between medians

00:02:34.354 --> 00:02:36.257
"rounded to the nearest five minutes."

00:02:36.257 --> 00:02:37.849
What is going on over here?

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:39.646
You might say well look,
"She got her result that she

00:02:39.646 --> 00:02:44.027
"wanted to get, this data
seems to confirm that

00:02:44.027 --> 00:02:46.429
"bus A gets her to work faster.

00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:48.578
"What's all this other
business with re-randomization

00:02:48.578 --> 00:02:50.016
"she's doing?"

00:02:50.016 --> 00:02:53.251
The important thing to realize
is, and she realizes this,

00:02:53.251 --> 00:02:55.052
is that she might have
just gotten this data that

00:02:55.052 --> 00:02:56.799
I underlined, by random chance.

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:59.615
There's some chance maybe A
and B are completely similar,

00:02:59.615 --> 00:03:01.857
in terms of how long they take in reality.

00:03:01.857 --> 00:03:05.120
She just happened to pick bus A on days

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.836
where bus A got to work faster.

00:03:06.836 --> 00:03:09.871
Maybe bus B is faster but
she just happened to take

00:03:09.871 --> 00:03:12.355
bus A on the days that it was faster.

00:03:12.355 --> 00:03:15.455
The days it just happened
to have less traffic.

00:03:15.455 --> 00:03:18.799
What she's doing here is
she re-randomized the data

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.178
and she wants to see that
with all this re-randomized

00:03:21.178 --> 00:03:24.615
data, out of these 1000 re-randomizations,

00:03:24.615 --> 00:03:27.565
what fraction of them do
I get a result like this?

00:03:27.565 --> 00:03:32.209
Do I get a result where A is
eight minutes or more faster?

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.142
Or you could say that the
median travel duration for bus A

00:03:35.142 --> 00:03:38.151
is eight minutes less,
or even less than that,

00:03:38.151 --> 00:03:39.760
than the median travel for bus B.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.006
So if it was nine minutes
less, or 10 minutes less,

00:03:42.006 --> 00:03:44.719
or 15 minutes less, those
are all the interesting ones.

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:46.939
Those are the ones that
confirm our hypothesis,

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:49.873
that bus A gets to work faster.

00:03:49.873 --> 00:03:51.705
Let's look at this table, it's not below,

00:03:51.705 --> 00:03:53.226
it's actually to the right.

00:03:53.226 --> 00:03:56.468
Let's just remind ourselves
what she did here,

00:03:56.468 --> 00:03:58.796
cause the first time
you try to process this

00:03:58.796 --> 00:04:00.949
it can seem a little bit daunting.

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:03.160
So, in her experiment,

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.968
let me write this down, experiment...

00:04:06.968 --> 00:04:09.010
The car alarm outside which
you probably, hopefully

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.146
are not hearing, it's actually
a surprisingly pleasant

00:04:11.146 --> 00:04:13.351
sounding car alarm, sounds like a

00:04:13.351 --> 00:04:16.750
slightly obnoxious bird,
but anyway (laughs).

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.450
Her experiment is, the way I described it,

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.334
25 days she would take bus A,
25 days she would take bus B.

00:04:24.334 --> 00:04:26.238
She would record all the
travel times and let's say

00:04:26.238 --> 00:04:28.587
that I have 25 data points in each column.

00:04:28.587 --> 00:04:33.015
Let's say they get 12 minutes,
20 minutes, 25 minutes,

00:04:33.015 --> 00:04:35.982
and you just keep going,
there's 25 data points.

00:04:35.982 --> 00:04:39.500
Let's just say that there are
12 data points less than 20

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.674
minutes and 12 data points
more than 20 minutes.

00:04:42.674 --> 00:04:45.446
In this circumstance,
her median time for bus A

00:04:45.446 --> 00:04:48.084
would be 20 minutes and I
just made this number up.

00:04:48.084 --> 00:04:50.645
So in order for this to
be eight minutes less

00:04:50.645 --> 00:04:53.075
than the median time for
bus B, the median for bus B

00:04:53.075 --> 00:04:56.719
would have to be 28 and maybe
you have data points here.

00:04:56.719 --> 00:05:01.284
Maybe this is 18 and you have
12 more that are less than 28.

00:05:01.284 --> 00:05:05.744
Then you have 12 more
that are greater than 28.

00:05:05.744 --> 00:05:09.684
So the median time for bus B

00:05:12.424 --> 00:05:16.133
would be 28, once again
I just made this data up.

00:05:16.133 --> 00:05:18.998
If you took treatment group median.

00:05:18.998 --> 00:05:22.547
I 'll just write TGM for short.

00:05:22.547 --> 00:05:27.153
TGM minus control group median.

00:05:28.258 --> 00:05:31.568
What do you get? 20 minus
28 is negative eight.

00:05:31.568 --> 00:05:34.280
This is the actual results of....

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.128
These are theoretical,
potential results, hypothetical

00:05:37.128 --> 00:05:39.708
results for her actual experiment.

00:05:39.708 --> 00:05:42.006
Now what's all of this business over here?

00:05:42.006 --> 00:05:44.650
What she did is she took
these times and she said,

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.108
"You know what, let's just
imagine a world where I could

00:05:47.108 --> 00:05:49.905
"have gotten any of these
times randomly on either bus."

00:05:49.905 --> 00:05:54.538
So she just randomly
re-sorted them between

00:05:55.691 --> 00:05:58.885
A and B, she did that a thousand times.

00:05:58.885 --> 00:06:02.753
The first time, the second
time, the third time.

00:06:02.753 --> 00:06:04.722
She does this

00:06:04.722 --> 00:06:07.785
1000 times.

00:06:07.785 --> 00:06:10.008
I'm assuming she used some
type of computer program

00:06:10.008 --> 00:06:12.583
to do it and each time, once again,

00:06:12.583 --> 00:06:15.421
she just took the data
that she had and she just

00:06:15.421 --> 00:06:18.967
rearranged it, she just reshuffled it.

00:06:18.967 --> 00:06:22.139
Maybe A on one day.

00:06:24.133 --> 00:06:27.063
Maybe it got this 18.

00:06:27.063 --> 00:06:29.781
Maybe it gets the 25.

00:06:29.781 --> 00:06:32.514
Maybe it gets a 30.

00:06:32.514 --> 00:06:34.971
Once again, I got the 18, the 25, the 30

00:06:34.971 --> 00:06:37.041
and maybe B gets the...

00:06:37.041 --> 00:06:38.957
You know she's reshuffling
all these other data points

00:06:38.957 --> 00:06:41.280
that I just have with dots and maybe B...

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.546
Let's see she had the 18,
25, 30, maybe 12, 20, and 28.

00:06:49.253 --> 00:06:52.037
So in this circumstance,
this random reshuffling

00:06:52.037 --> 00:06:54.007
and she keeps doing it
over and over again.

00:06:54.007 --> 00:06:58.658
In this random reshuffling,
the treatment group median

00:06:58.658 --> 00:07:01.997
minus the control group
median is going to be what?

00:07:01.997 --> 00:07:04.274
It's going to be equal to positive five.

00:07:04.274 --> 00:07:08.012
In this random shuffling,
this hypothetical scenario,

00:07:08.012 --> 00:07:11.621
Bus A's median would
have been five minutes

00:07:11.621 --> 00:07:14.648
longer than bus B's.

00:07:14.648 --> 00:07:17.728
If she gets this result
with this random re-sorting,

00:07:17.728 --> 00:07:19.875
this would have been...

00:07:20.506 --> 00:07:23.278
She would have had a column here for five.

00:07:23.278 --> 00:07:25.585
Then she would have

00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:28.081
put one notch right over here.

00:07:28.081 --> 00:07:31.373
It looks like she classified
things or maybe she didn't even

00:07:31.373 --> 00:07:35.284
get the data but she classified
them by multiples of two.

00:07:35.284 --> 00:07:37.640
If she got this again then
she would have put a two here.

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.901
Then she would have said,
"Okay, in how many of these

00:07:39.901 --> 00:07:43.499
"random reshufflings am I
getting a scenario where

00:07:43.499 --> 00:07:46.904
"there's a five minute difference?

00:07:46.904 --> 00:07:48.999
"Or where the treatment group
was five minutes longer?"

00:07:48.999 --> 00:07:50.854
What is this saying?

00:07:50.854 --> 00:07:55.024
For example, this is saying that 18

00:07:55.024 --> 00:07:57.657
out of the 1000 reshufflings,
which she just randomly

00:07:57.657 --> 00:08:01.383
re-shuffled the data, 18
out of those 1000 times,

00:08:01.383 --> 00:08:05.240
she found a scenario where
her treatment group median

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:08.155
was 10 minutes longer
than her control group.

00:08:08.155 --> 00:08:11.927
Where bus A's median
was in this hypothetical

00:08:11.927 --> 00:08:14.401
re-randomization where
the treatment group is

00:08:14.401 --> 00:08:17.714
10 minutes slower than the control group.

00:08:17.714 --> 00:08:21.828
There were 159 times where
the treatment group...

00:08:21.828 --> 00:08:24.020
Once again, in her random
reshuffling, these aren't based

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:27.001
on observations, these
are random reshufflings.

00:08:27.001 --> 00:08:30.877
There's 159 times where
her treatment group is

00:08:30.877 --> 00:08:33.630
four minutes slower
than her control group.

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:35.648
The whole reason for
doing this is she says,

00:08:35.648 --> 00:08:38.799
"Okay, what's the probability
of getting a result

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:41.791
"like this or better?"

00:08:41.791 --> 00:08:44.478
I say, "better", as one
that even more confirms her

00:08:44.478 --> 00:08:47.067
hypothesis, that the
treatment group is faster

00:08:47.067 --> 00:08:48.626
than the control group.

00:08:48.626 --> 00:08:50.974
Well, the scenario, this
scenario is this one right

00:08:50.974 --> 00:08:54.854
over here and then another
one that the treatment group

00:08:54.854 --> 00:08:57.349
is even faster, is this right over here.

00:08:57.349 --> 00:09:00.743
Here, the treatment group
median is 10 less than

00:09:00.743 --> 00:09:02.704
the control group median.

00:09:02.704 --> 00:09:06.601
In how many of these scenarios,
out of the thousands,

00:09:06.601 --> 00:09:07.972
is this occurring?

00:09:07.972 --> 00:09:11.090
Well, this one occurs 85
times, this one occurs eight.

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:15.329
If you add these two together,
93 out of the thousand times,

00:09:15.329 --> 00:09:17.883
out of her re-randomization
or I guess you could

00:09:17.883 --> 00:09:21.896
say 9.3 percent of the time, the data...

00:09:21.896 --> 00:09:26.896
9.3 percent of the randomized,
the 1000 re-randomizations,

00:09:28.348 --> 00:09:31.933
9.3 percent of the time she got data

00:09:31.933 --> 00:09:35.974
that was as validating
of a hypothesis or more

00:09:35.974 --> 00:09:38.335
than the actual experiment.

00:09:38.335 --> 00:09:42.010
One way to think about
this is, the probability of

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:45.730
randomly getting the
results from her experiment

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:48.511
or better results from her experiment

00:09:48.511 --> 00:09:51.376
are 9.3 percent.

00:09:51.376 --> 00:09:55.288
They're low, it's a reasonably
low probability that

00:09:55.288 --> 00:09:57.430
this happened purely by chance.

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:59.553
Now, a question is,
"What's the threshold?"

00:09:59.553 --> 00:10:01.559
If it was a 50 percent you
say, "Okay, this was very

00:10:01.559 --> 00:10:03.287
"likely to happen by chance."

00:10:03.287 --> 00:10:06.333
If this was a 25 percent
you're like, "Okay, it's less

00:10:06.333 --> 00:10:08.692
"likely to happen by chance
but it could happen."

00:10:08.692 --> 00:10:12.534
9.3 percent, it's roughly 10 percent.

00:10:12.534 --> 00:10:17.109
For every 10 people who do
an experiment like she did,

00:10:17.109 --> 00:10:20.671
even if it was random, one
person would get data like this?

00:10:20.671 --> 00:10:23.133
What typically happens amongst
statisticians is they draw

00:10:23.133 --> 00:10:24.881
a threshold and the threshold for

00:10:24.881 --> 00:10:28.894
statistical significance
is usually five percent.

00:10:28.894 --> 00:10:30.901
One way to think about it,
the probability of her getting

00:10:30.901 --> 00:10:32.745
this result by chance,

00:10:32.745 --> 00:10:35.484
this result or a more extreme result?

00:10:35.484 --> 00:10:38.224
One that more confirms
her hypothesis by chance

00:10:38.224 --> 00:10:40.377
is 9.3 percent.

00:10:40.377 --> 00:10:44.211
If you're cut-off for
significance is five percent.

00:10:44.211 --> 00:10:46.366
If you said, "Okay, this has
to be five percent or less."

00:10:46.366 --> 00:10:49.167
Then you say, "Okay, this is
not statistically significant."

00:10:49.167 --> 00:10:52.001
There's more than a five
percent chance that I could

00:10:52.001 --> 00:10:54.909
have gotten this result
purely through random chance.

00:10:54.909 --> 00:10:57.080
Once again, that just depends on where you

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:58.771
have that threshold.

00:10:58.771 --> 00:11:00.685
When we go back, I think
we've already answered

00:11:00.685 --> 00:11:03.183
the final question,
"According to the simulations,

00:11:03.183 --> 00:11:05.495
"what is the probability of
the treatment group's median

00:11:05.495 --> 00:11:08.032
"being lower than the
control group's median

00:11:08.032 --> 00:11:09.988
"by eight minutes or more?"

00:11:09.988 --> 00:11:12.263
Which once again, eight
minutes or more, that would be

00:11:12.263 --> 00:11:15.132
negative eight and negative 10.

00:11:15.132 --> 00:11:18.313
We just figured that out,
that was 93 out of the 1000

00:11:18.313 --> 00:11:22.704
re-randomizations, so
it's a 9.3 percent chance.

00:11:22.704 --> 00:11:25.153
If you set five percent as
your cut-off for statistical

00:11:25.153 --> 00:11:28.929
significance, you say, "Okay,
this doesn't quite meet my

00:11:28.929 --> 00:11:32.078
"cut-off so maybe this
is not a statistically

00:11:32.078 --> 00:11:35.089
"significant result."
