[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.640
PARUL SOI: Hi, everyone.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.250
Hope you've been enjoying the
day one of this summit so far.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.320
I'm far away.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.050
I'm part of the
Google Play team.

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.490
SEB GRUBB: And I'm Seb, on
the Android framework team.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.120
Before we head out
to lunch, we just

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.495
want to take a few minutes to
talk to you about something

00:00:20.495 --> 00:00:21.380
pretty important--

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.400
PARUL SOI: Privacy.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.060
Specifically, we want to talk
to you about certain practices

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.100
that you as app
developers can adopt

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.200
to build products
that continue to wow

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.380
your users, at the same time,
protect their right to privacy.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.320
We want Android to
be a platform where

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.110
you can offer
personalized experiences

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.590
and make the life
of your user simple.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.490
But, at the same time,
privacy is important

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.970
and transparency, in terms of
what data you're collecting

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.950
and how you're using it, is
very important to be shared.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.830
SEB GRUBB: So, to ensure
Android can continue

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.300
to serve as a platform that
allows developers to build

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.690
such experiences
and protect users,

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.730
we have ongoing efforts
that span multiple releases.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.370
So the things we want to
touch upon today are--

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.590
how your apps are
accessing user data;

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.480
ensuring that your
users have control

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.330
over data being accessed;
and, most importantly,

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.060
that there is transparency
into why the data is required

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.090
and how it is being used.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.290
So we have a multilayered
approach to privacy in Android.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.510
Firstly, we focus
on platform updates

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.270
to improve the APIs that
are used by apps to access

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.440
personal information.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.450
PARUL SOI: We then set
up our Play policies

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.210
for keeping abuse in
check and also ensuring

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.040
that a level playing
field is provided

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.050
to the developers and a safe
experience for our users.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.020
SEB GRUBB: We've built
out a [INAUDIBLE] layer

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.920
to identify early on
when apps may be abusing

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.440
a user's personal information.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.370
PARUL SOI: We also
have human reviewers

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.300
so it's not just bots and
AI, but actual people who

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.720
review these apps to make sure
that a user's right to privacy

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.720
is always secured, and also
ensure that the safe experience

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.150
is provided.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.900
We also invest heavily to work
with a community of security

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.039
researchers.

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.600
Please do check
out these programs.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.460
We have the Play
Security Rewards Program

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.156
and Vulnerability
Rewards Programs.

00:02:13.156 --> 00:02:15.030
And, also, please feel
free to drop by if you

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.230
want to know more about these.

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.620
SEB GRUBB: And, finally, we
have Google Play Protect,

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.350
which helps users conserve
the privacy and security.

00:02:28.734 --> 00:02:30.900
PARUL SOI: So why are we
here speaking to you today?

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.510
Because we feel
privacy and security

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.275
is a partnership between the
platform and developers as you.

00:02:37.275 --> 00:02:40.360
You, as developers who
actually build out these apps,

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.840
play a very vital
role in the ecosystem.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.420
You have the ability to
advocate for better privacy

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.550
practices in your
company and ways

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.100
to ensure that the team's
vision of your product

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.135
is not compromised at the
right of users' privacy.

00:02:54.135 --> 00:02:56.890
For example, if
you have a request

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.200
to collect certain
bits of information

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.590
about a user from their
device, a question always worth

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.090
asking is, do we really need it?

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.550
How do you plan to use it?

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.040
And are we still using
it, in the instances

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.260
of historical data collection.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.810
The reason is that
it is actually not

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.140
very uncommon for certain
information about a user

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.110
to be collected in guise of
behavioral analytics, which

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.619
is actually never used, and is
sometimes abandoned altogether.

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:26.410
SEB GRUBB: Some examples
of data that we've

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.190
seen being collected
includes IMEI, used

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.890
as a unique identifier
for tracking users;

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.800
the list of installed apps,
either to fingerprint a user

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.570
or to target ads
to them; collecting

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.420
the location of an app
open, or cellular network

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.900
information such as the name
of a network or of a strength.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.480
You probably don't always
need such information.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.430
So, for a few cases, we offer
more privacy-conscious options.

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.250
So we encourage you to use
them if they fit your use case.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.640
Some examples
include we encourage

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.170
you to use instance or Android
ID instead of the hardware

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.480
identifiers such as IMEI.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.700
If you're trying to confirm
a user's phone number,

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.620
we encourage you to use
a Play SMS retriever

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.360
API instead of the
SMS permission,

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.850
which is not as granular.

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.550
You could also consider only
requesting course location

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.959
instead of phone location.

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.769
And then, if you want to
see if a user is in a call,

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.140
you could check
for an audio focus,

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.470
rather than requesting a
read phone state, which

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.180
gives out a lot more data.

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.520
PARUL SOI: And, lastly,
you want to ensure

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.820
that your users are aware of
what data is being collected

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.450
and how it is being used.

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.270
This is not just
a best practice,

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.270
but is actually a requirement
by Google Play policy.

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.750
A rule of thumb is that
if a user is not aware

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.180
that some data about them
is about to be collected

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.850
and for what purpose
it is being used,

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.470
you are required to
prominently disclose it to them

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.420
and get the permission to do so.

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.270
So the example
that we have here--

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.040
the data is being collected
off the installed apps

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.020
on a user's device for
fraud prevention purposes.

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.070
So this needs to be prominently
disclosed to the user.

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.290
And only after your
user consents to it

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.842
should the data be transferred.

00:05:07.842 --> 00:05:09.550
SEB GRUBB: In the
latest Android releases

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.280
we've worked hard to offer
more privacy-sensitive OS.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.200
And we're going to walk you
through a few of those changes.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.240
In Android 9 we
split up the call

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.730
log permissions from the
phone permission group

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:22.290
into their own
permission group--

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.860
call log-- to give users more
transparency into what apps

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:26.910
are doing.

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:31.500
So if your app is reading phone
numbers from a phone's state

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.870
broadcast change,
we're now asking

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:38.800
you to request both a call log
and a phone state permissions.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.620
In Android 8, we dedicated
a build serial static field,

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.380
replacing it with a build.get
serial function, that requires

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.011
a read phone state permission.

00:05:47.011 --> 00:05:49.010
If you're going to use
it, please be sure you're

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:50.690
going to use it
for valid purposes.

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.670
Because it's a Play
policy violation

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:56.455
to use it for
advertising purposes.

00:05:56.455 --> 00:05:59.190
PARUL SOI: Speaking of
limited access, a reminder--

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.260
apps running in the
background on Android 9.0

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.440
will require the
following restrictions--

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.680
you will no longer have
access to mic or camera

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.700
in the background; sensors,
such as accurate gyroscope,

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:13.300
directed on empty data.

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.770
If your app needs access
to sensor events on devices

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.900
running Android
9.0, you will need

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.590
to use a foreground service.

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:23.340
And to further inform
and protect the user,

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.800
the system will also
add a visual aid

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.710
to your notifications when
your services are accessing

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:29.940
the camera or the mic.

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.210
SEB GRUBB: Our
Contacts Provider API

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:36.890
used to allow apps
to collect data

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.270
about how often a contact
was being contacted,

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.450
allowing other apps
to glean information

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:44.960
about interactions not happening
within their own scope.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.600
So, as of January next
year, a limited set

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.930
of contact fields and methods
will be made obsolete.

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:53.570
These include fields relating
to the last time a contact was

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:55.690
accessed or contacted.

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:58.700
So if your app is accessing
or updating these fields,

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.810
we ask you to use
alternative methods.

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:03.760
For example, you could
fulfill certain use cases

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.325
by using private
content providers

00:07:05.325 --> 00:07:07.325
or simply storing data
in your back-end systems.

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:13.460
PARUL SOI: This was a really
brief talk about best practices

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:14.470
for privacy.

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:17.620
We hope that we've been able to
offer you at least some insight

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:21.040
into how you can build apps
that are conscious of users'

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.620
right to privacy and
also compliant with all

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:24.850
our policies.

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:27.460
So as we've mentioned
earlier, we definitely

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:29.260
believe that
security and privacy

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.450
is a partnership between
you, the developer,

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:32.597
and our platform.

00:07:32.597 --> 00:07:34.180
So if you have any
questions about it,

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:36.370
please do come find us
at the office hours.

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:38.230
And I hope you all
have a great summit

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:39.910
and have a great lunch as well.

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:41.020
Thank you so much.

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:41.920
SEB GRUBB: Thank you.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.270
