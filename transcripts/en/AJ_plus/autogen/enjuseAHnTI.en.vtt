00:00:03.157 --> 00:00:04.517
Well ... kind of.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.445
One of the few things that the two parties seem to agree on

00:00:07.445 --> 00:00:12.480
is that the pharmaceutical industry in the United States has become too powerful.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.498
Ten companies accounted
for half of all the profits

00:00:15.498 --> 00:00:18.117
in the health care sector last year.

00:00:18.121 --> 00:00:22.220
Nine of them were 
drug manufacturers.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.761
Over the last decade, 
prescription drug prices have soared.

00:00:25.761 --> 00:00:28.637
According to the Department 
of Health and Human Services,

00:00:28.637 --> 00:00:35.037
Americans spent almost $460 billion on prescription drugs in 2015.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.602
So we are, by far and away,
the most expensive country

00:00:38.602 --> 00:00:41.320
when you go to buy prescription drugs.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.922
For most drugs, we pay about
three to four times more

00:00:45.922 --> 00:00:50.080
than what other countries pay
for identical brand name drugs,

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.640
which are the drugs 
that have patents.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.618
For drugs that don't have patents, 
which are called generic drugs,

00:00:56.618 --> 00:01:00.280
we pay about the same 
as most other countries.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.957
So, why is Big Pharma so, well, big?

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.282
Martin Shkreli became
infamous after he raised the price

00:01:07.282 --> 00:01:10.162
of a lifesaving drug by 5,000%.

00:01:10.162 --> 00:01:12.197
In defending his decision, he said,

00:01:12.197 --> 00:01:13.336
You know, this is a

00:01:15.884 --> 00:01:18.204
I mean, he wasn't exactly wrong.

00:01:18.204 --> 00:01:23.213
There's one fundamental reason for why drugs
are so expensive in the United States.

00:01:23.213 --> 00:01:27.522
In the United States, there's nobody saying
that you can't raise your prices.

00:01:30.213 --> 00:01:32.800
And if you want to raise your prices, 
you can.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.481
You just assume that you'll get the business.

00:01:35.481 --> 00:01:40.000
And in most cases you do, because 
people need their drugs

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.440
and they're willing to pay
a much higher price.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:48.402
In most countries, there are regulations
to try to keep the prices down.

00:01:48.402 --> 00:01:52.081
In the United States we don't have 
those same regulations.

00:01:52.081 --> 00:01:54.881
So, this freedom that U.S. 
pharma companies have

00:01:54.881 --> 00:01:57.202
to dictate how much they want to charge

00:01:57.202 --> 00:02:00.641
has exactly the kind of
consequence you think it would have:

00:02:00.641 --> 00:02:01.877
prices can get

00:02:03.522 --> 00:02:05.802
Take pharma company Mylan, for example.

00:02:05.802 --> 00:02:08.040
Between 2013 and 2014,

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.360
Mylan increased the price of 
Albuterol, which is used to treat asthma,

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.960
from $11 to $434.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.120
That's almost 40 times higher.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.880
They also increased the price of a 
drug called Doxycycline Hyclate,

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.160
which is prescribed to
treat all kinds of infections.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.160
It rose from $27 to $1,849.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.600
Let me do the math for you:
That’s almost 70 times more.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.600
As expected, this price fluctuation
impacts Americans.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.080
About one in five Americans 
reports that they have not

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.280
filled a prescription, 
or taken a reduced dose

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.400
relative to what they were prescribed,
or skipped doses,

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.360
because of concerns about 
affording their medications.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.200
One in eight American adults reported this year

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.800
that they have reduced the amount

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.840
that they spend on food in order
to afford their medications.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.680
For a while, the pharmaceutical industry
 was able to avoid

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.640
direct confrontation with 
Congress over prices

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.240
because, like other 
sectors in the United States,

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.160
Big Pharma lobbies, and it lobbies hard.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.160
Back in 2017, President Trump said this:

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.440
They contribute massive amounts
 of money to political people.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.480
I don’t know, Mitch [McConnell], 
maybe even to you.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.760
We know that the 
pharmaceutical industry has always

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.320
We know that the 
pharmaceutical industry has always

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.880
invested very heavily in lobbying.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.840
They are the top industry in lobbying 
and have been for many years.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.060
They are equal opportunity givers.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.060
They give to people on both
 sides of the political aisle, democrats and republicans.

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.720
So, you know, a sort of 
political realist view is that

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.240
there are lots of folks in Congress who
 are beholden to this industry.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.720
Oh, and if you’re wondering ...

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.120
Trump was also right about 
Big Pharma donating to Mitch McConnell.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.240
The senator received almost $1 million

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:58.080
from the pharmaceutical and health product industry between 2013 and 2018.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.480
And as if the health care system wasn't
complicated enough,

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.600
there are other players involved
in the drug-pricing system.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.960
Let me introduce you to

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:15.240
Back in the 1960s, we didn't provide
 drug benefiats to most people,

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.960
and the private insurers, which provided 
most of the insurance at the time,

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:24.960
didn't know how to do drug benefits. So
 they didn't want to get involved.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.880
So they decided that they would have a
separate company provide the drug benefits.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.000
And these were called pharmacy
 benefit managers, or PBMs.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.160
They were created to negotiate prices

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.080
with the drug companies on 
behalf of the health insurers.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.840
Today, PBMs not only negotiate prescription drug prices

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.840
for more than 266 million Americans,

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.920
they also determine which medications 
are available to consumers.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.720
their purpose, is to reduce prescription drug costs

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.680
for consumers, employers and insurers.

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.040
But, it turns out, there's very little transparency

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.440
and a whole lot of confusion about how PBMs operate,

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.960
which impacts the final price of a drug.

00:05:09.432 --> 00:05:14.320
Insurance companies hire PBMs to 
negotiate prices with drug manufacturers.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:19.200
Now, the drug manufacturers pay 
what we call rebates to PBMs.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.600
Rebates are discounts pharma companies 
give PBMs on medication

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.360
in exchange for getting priority placement on a formulary. This is a list of drugs

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.360
that insurers agree to help cover.

00:05:30.637 --> 00:05:33.560
Manufacturers that offer bigger 
rebates for their drugs

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.480
also tend to get better market access, 
so Americans are more likely to choose them.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.440
But are they really cheaper?

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.680
This is where it gets really murky.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.640
Most of the rebate goes to PBMs and insurers,

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.520
who say it helps them keep premiums and out-of-pocket costs low.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:56.840
One research firm estimated insurers received $89 billion in rebates in 2016.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.480
It's unclear how much PBMs got because
 there is little to no transparency.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.800
Because PBM discounts are usually hidden,

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.120
some argue insurers overcharge 
their patients for medication.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.480
According to research, the problem
is that some consumers might pay

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:17.560
based on the original list price of a drug, not the cost after the rebate.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.880
Imagine a drug manufacturer lists a prescription medication

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.000
as $100 but offers it to PBMs for $60.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.360
If a patient's coinsurance payment was 20%

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.320
and they paid on the discounted price of $60,

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.200
their out-of-pocket cost would be $12.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.160
But instead,

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.600
because they pay based on the

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.640
the original list price of $100,

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.920
their out-of-pocket expense jumps to $20.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:42.960
Drug companies say they have to raise the list price of their drugs

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.960
Drug companies say they have to raise the list price of their drugs

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.920
to stay profitable and offer sizable rebates to PBMs.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:52.200
And critics accuse PBMs of wanting to keep list prices high

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.880
so they can reap a bigger profit.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.040
But PBMs and insurers vehemently disagree.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.440
They argue their practices have saved consumers money

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.600
and keep drug prices in check.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.520
See, I told you it’s complicated.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:09.400
That's why the secretary of health and human services has targeted PBMs

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:13.720
saying it may be necessary to move away from a rebate system altogether.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:17.480
Drug companies have also found a way to game the patent system,

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.400
initially set in place to protect and reward innovation.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:24.640
The important thing to understand 
about price is that price depends on

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.840
the amount of competition in the market.

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.240
It doesn't depend per se on whether a company

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.000
has a patent or doesn't have a patent.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.720
But having a patent can 
of course affect the amount

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.200
of competition in the market.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:39.520
So in the worst case scenario, a company has a patent on their drugs

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.560
and that not only means there's no generic competitors,

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.640
but it also means they are first in class.

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:47.560
There's not another branded or patented medication out there that’s

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.240
competing with that patented medication.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.920
So what you have there is a situation where you've got exclusive rights

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:57.240
to sell essentially for an entire class of medication.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:00.040
And if people want drugs for that condition,

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.800
they've got to buy your product at the price that you want.

00:08:03.429 --> 00:08:08.000
In February 2019, leaders of seven major pharmaceutical companies

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.320
were grilled by a bipartisan Senate committee on rising drug costs.

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:16.200
That marked a significant turning point in Congress' traditionally

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.640
cozy relationship with the pharma industry.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:21.040
During that hearing, pharma companies justified

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:23.240
the high price tags by blaming PBMs.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:26.920
They also spoke about the innovation of new drugs.

00:08:27.634 --> 00:08:30.520
The primary justification that 
the drug companies offer

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:34.800
is their enormous investment in research and development for new drugs

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:37.320
and the high failure rate of those efforts.

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:41.800
When you consider the fact that eight or nine out of every 10 molecules

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:46.200
that they put into the development pipeline fails, it never makes it to market,

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:49.800
they'll argue, we need to have a big return on our investment

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.600
in the one that does. It has to cover our costs for all the failures.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.000
in the one that does. It has to cover our costs for all the failures.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.040
So the exact amount that they spend on research and development

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.600
is disputed.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:02.080
But studies have put it as high as $2.6 billion

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.280
for each new drug that reaches market

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:07.240
when you consider what they invested in the failure drugs

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:10.880
and the opportunity cost associated with not investing that capital

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.320
in other investments.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.480
But critics haven't fully bought into that argument.

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:19.520
I think one observation people have made is that, you know,

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:22.840
a rational drug company, and these are very sophisticated entities,

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:28.120
should set the launch price of that drug at a level that is reasonably calculated

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:30.160
to give it a return on investment.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:35.400
So that argument doesn't explain the instances we've seen of escalations in price

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:38.320
year after year that are well above inflation.

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:39.920
You know, the [research and development] is done.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:43.960
Why is it that the initial price now is somehow too low and you have to increase it

00:09:46.264 --> 00:09:49.920
The other thing that people will point out is that drug companies,

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:52.760
by some calculations, spend more on marketing their drugs

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.560
than they do on research and development.

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:57.960
So to come crying poverty when you are spending lavishly

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:02.880
on aggressive promotion of drugs, and doing very well in terms of margins,

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.720
can be hard for some to hear.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:08.000
So, if drug manufacturers have managed to hold off Congress

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.320
and any major industry reforms for so long,

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:13.120
what's changing exactly?

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.960
Answer: an increasingly outraged public.

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:20.560
A 2018 poll found that 72% of respondents felt

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:23.360
pharmaceutical companies have “too much influence.”

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:27.840
What's changing in the last few years is the profits

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.920
of the pharmaceutical industry have grown dramatically,

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:35.520
the profits of the PBM industry have grown dramatically,

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:40.240
but the consumer has to end up paying much higher prices

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:44.280
and drug prices have become, in health care,

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:47.600
the No. 1 policy issue in the United States.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:51.480
The outrage has prompted Democrats and Republicans to realize

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:55.680
that Big Pharma is going to be a major 2020 campaign issue.

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:59.960
While there seems to be bipartisan consensus that drug prices need to be lowered,

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:03.040
the parties disagree on the best
way to make that happen.

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:06.720
So the Democrats would prefer to do negotiation,

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:09.600
having the government directly involved,

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:14.920
whereas the Republicans want to push more and more competition,

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:20.800
to bring drugs to the market faster, to have more generic drugs in the market.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:23.000
So they have different approaches

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.560
but they seem to be agreeing now on some combination

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:31.000
of having more government oversight and more government regulation

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.600
but at the same time promoting competition.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:38.280
And for some, that may just be the best way forward.

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:43.120
I think there have to be stronger policies that put the brakes on the system,

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:47.480
that regulate drug companies’ ability 
to set very high launch prices

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:51.000
and to increase them year after year.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.160
Another thing that would be very fruitful to pursue

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:58.160
are policies that improve competition in the marketplace.

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:01.600
Because we see instances of companies getting patents

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.280
that they perhaps shouldn't have,

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:07.040
gaming our regulatory programs to get additional market exclusivity,

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:10.160
buying up companies that are bringing up

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:14.760
potentially competitive products, and a variety of other anti-competitive practices.

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:18.280
You know, it's really a situation where regardless of

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:20.400
whether you're a Democrat that might be pro-regulation

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.360
or a Republican who’s pro-market,

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:26.640
you should like policies that make it possible to have robust competition.

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:28.120
And there are a lot of things we could do.
