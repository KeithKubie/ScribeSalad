00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.939
Hello I’m Daven Hiskey, you’re watching
the Today I Found Out YouTube channel, in

00:00:03.939 --> 00:00:08.040
the video today, we’re looking at why the
cheddar cheese you find on shelves at supermarkets

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.009
is often some shade of orange when milk is
white.

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.929
Milk is made up of about 87% water and 13%
solids, such as fat and various proteins.

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:24.280
Chief among these proteins is something called
casein, four types of which make up about

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.400
80% of the proteins in milk.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.800
The casein protein molecules are typically
suspended somewhat uniformly throughout the

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.690
milk and are spherical, about a micrometer
across.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.050
The reason they are somewhat uniformly suspended
in the liquid is because kappa-casein molecules

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.600
have a negative electrical charge, so they
repel each other.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.600
White objects in nature appear such when there
is some level of light diffusion going on

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.780
and no part of the visible spectrum gets reflected
off the object any more than any other part

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.050
of that area of the light spectrum.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.960
As you might guess from that, these casein
proteins and some of the fats in the milk

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.280
scatter and deflect light somewhat uniformly
throughout the visual spectrum.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.180
This results in milk being fairly opaque and
appearing white to our eyes.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.360
This brings us back to the question at hand-
if milk is white, why is cheddar cheese such

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.720
a striking orange-ish / yellow color?

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.600
Before more modern industrialized milk farming,
cows grazed in pastures abundant with beta-carotene-rich

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.600
grasses.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.950
As they digest the naturally orange-ish pigment
in the grass, it is stored in their fat cells.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.560
When a cow gives milk, the beta-carotene-colored
milk fat is secreted in globules, primarily

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.410
made of triglyceride surrounded by a lipid
membrane, which itself is surrounded by protein

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:34.410
clusters.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.259
While the cow's milk will usually still appear
mostly white in the human visual spectrum,

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:42.280
depending on the type of cow, the time of
year, and the fields it's grazing in, this

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.399
beta-carotene laden fat can turn the milk
an off-white, or in the extreme, a slightly

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.520
golden color.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.189
With traditional cheddar cheese making, the
beta-carotene infused fat is left in the milk,

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.759
and after the rennet, bacteria and heat work
their magic on the liquid, the protein clusters

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.950
release their grip on the globules and their
membranes dissolve, such that they are no

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.799
longer opaque, making the beta-carotene a
little more visible.

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:09.870
Once the whey is drained and pressed out,
the fat is also more concentrated in the final

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:12.120
product than it was in the original milk.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.710
Thus, since the color comes from the beta-carotene
in the fat, for those cheeses made this way

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.330
(as opposed to things like higher acid cheeses
or those made with goat or buffalo milk),

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.020
those with the higher fat content will tend
to take on a yellow-ish hue.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.510
Accordingly, cheddar, with approximately 32%
fat content (compared to, say, whole milk

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.610
mozzarella at about 17%) classically was a
slight golden color (akin to butter that hasn't

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.230
been dyed), rather than the distinct orange/yellow
color we typically associate with cheddar

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.230
today.

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.480
So why the change to deeper colors?

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.680
According to Professor Paul Kindstedt of the
University of Vermont, this started around

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.200
the 16th/17th century in England.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.200
At this time, certain cheese makers began
skimming some of the cream off the milk to

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.850
sell separately before making the cheddar,
lowering the fat content, but still producing

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.630
relatively tasty cheese.

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.410
This practice resulted in much paler, even
white, cheddars, which consumers found (and

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.160
still find) less desirable.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.070
To mask the true fat content, the farmers
began adding color back in.

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:15.120
Common colorants included marigold petals,
carrot juice and even saffron, but most cheese

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.160
makers ultimately settled on annatto, a relatively
cheap and available seed containing pigments

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.940
that will turn things a lovely yellow-orange,
depending on concentration.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.840
When cheese-making became industrialized in
the 19th century, many companies chose to

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.750
continue the practice of dying certain cheeses
like cheddar and, for marketing reasons, the

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.370
exact hue of the cheese continued to move
away from the classic light gold to more of

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.240
the orange-ish / yellow we have today.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:44.760
Beyond any form of agri-fraud certain 16th/17th
century cheese makers sometimes employed,

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.560
this was something of a necessity on an industrial
scale given that the manufacturers used milk

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.400
from numerous different farms to make their
products.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.720
Given the end color of the cheese could vary
greatly based on things like the time of year,

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.820
exact diet of the cows, and cattle used (Guernsey
and Jersey cattle, for instance, tend to produce

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:06.530
richer colored milk), it was very difficult
to get a consistent color in a given brand's

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.520
product without dying the cheddar.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.020
And as consumers, much like today, strongly
preferred near-pumpkin colored cheddars, the

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.540
practice of dying the cheddar was a handy
and cheap marketing trick.

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.060
Speaking of diet, over the last couple centuries,
many milk farmers have shifted away from primarily

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.540
pasture-feeding their cattle to providing
a dry feed diet.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.810
One of the key benefits to this is that the
farmer can ensure a much more consistent tasting

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.680
end product, though there does appear to be
some sacrifice in nutritional value in doing

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.680
this.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.410
More pertinent to this video, another negative
side effect, at least as far as many consumers

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:43.530
are concerned, is the dry feed diet lacks
the beta-carotene of the pasture grasses,

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:48.370
making the cheddar white, regardless of fat
content, again requiring the annatto seeds

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.480
to get the color consumers want.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.250
Many butter manufacturers dye their butters
yellow for similar reasons, regardless of

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.960
the quality of the butter itself or the diets
of the cattle producing the milk- a noticeable

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.510
golden color is simply what people expect
the color of butter to be and if it's not,

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:16.790
they'll usually buy the brand that offers
that color.
