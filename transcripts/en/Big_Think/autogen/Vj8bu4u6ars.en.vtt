inside of it and the tallest building
 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.930

usually in the town and they would ring

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:07.820
the steeple at you know 8 a.m. and we
would all congregate for mass and we

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830
would all congregate for mass and we
 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.490
would all congregate for mass and we
would listen to one message from one

incontrovertible truth from one source
 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.820
incontrovertible truth from one source
and that's not too dissimilar from

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830
and that's not too dissimilar from
 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.590

television architecture right you have a

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600
television architecture right you have a

television architecture right you have a
group of people in suits in New York or

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750
group of people in suits in New York or
 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.510
group of people in suits in New York or
in Los Angeles and they're deciding

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520
in Los Angeles and they're deciding
 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.980
in Los Angeles and they're deciding
what's going to be on television and

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990
what's going to be on television and
 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.960
what's going to be on television and
then they distribute it to those towers

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970
then they distribute it to those towers
 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.530
then they distribute it to those towers
and at seven pm prime time we aggregate

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540
and at seven pm prime time we aggregate
 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.969
and at seven pm prime time we aggregate
around the television that's been

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979
around the television that's been
 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.370
around the television that's been
brought into our home and we watch this

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380
brought into our home and we watch this
 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.410
brought into our home and we watch this
one incontrovertible truth in this

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420
one incontrovertible truth in this
 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.609
one incontrovertible truth in this
signal from a top-down approach and when

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619
signal from a top-down approach and when
 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.550
signal from a top-down approach and when
the internet started enabling people

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560
the internet started enabling people
 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.990
the internet started enabling people
first with this underlying network

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000
first with this underlying network
 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.020
first with this underlying network
architecture of tcp/ip that allowed us

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030
architecture of tcp/ip that allowed us
 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.910
architecture of tcp/ip that allowed us
to transcend time and distance that

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920
to transcend time and distance that
 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.310
to transcend time and distance that
allowed any node on the network to

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320
allowed any node on the network to
 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.499
allowed any node on the network to
contribute to the system and then we

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509
contribute to the system and then we
 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.210
contribute to the system and then we
started seeing things like video sharing

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220
started seeing things like video sharing
 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.719
started seeing things like video sharing
and photo sharing that allowed us all to

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729
and photo sharing that allowed us all to
 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.090
and photo sharing that allowed us all to
become publishers and then we have this

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100
become publishers and then we have this
 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.819
become publishers and then we have this
kind of now this layer of social that

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829
kind of now this layer of social that
 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.730
kind of now this layer of social that
has is redefining everything where every

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740
has is redefining everything where every
 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.039
has is redefining everything where every
single person is now contributing node

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:10.049
single person is now contributing node
 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:12.830
single person is now contributing node
on the network and every person that is

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840
on the network and every person that is
 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.290
on the network and every person that is
part of

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300
part of
 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.920

to distribute things in a horizontal
 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.680
to distribute things in a horizontal
fashion and so what that's doing is is

fashion and so what that's doing is is
 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.010
fashion and so what that's doing is is
that is destroying the ability to

that is destroying the ability to
 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.980
that is destroying the ability to
