1
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:05,690
The evolution of antibiotic resistance
is such a serious problem that

2
00:00:05,691 --> 00:00:10,610
evolutionary biologists
have started thinking about
methods of treating patients

3
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,880
that will not elicit an
evolutionary response.

4
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:16,270
Okay.

5
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:18,780
We,
we've seen the resistance evolves rapidly.

6
00:00:18,781 --> 00:00:23,340
We're losing the CO evolutionary arms
race and there are some alternatives to

7
00:00:23,341 --> 00:00:24,174
drugs.

8
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,990
One is slowing the emergence of resistance
just by using moderate doses and

9
00:00:29,991 --> 00:00:34,520
targeting old age classes of pathogens.
This is plausible.

10
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:38,120
We think it can work,
but it's controversial.

11
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,210
Patients naturally want to
get a strong dose if they can.

12
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:42,550
Yeah.

13
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:43,211
Secondly,

14
00:00:43,211 --> 00:00:47,650
we might be able to use viruses
themselves to fight bacterial infections.

15
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:53,220
Phage multiply in proportion to their
bacterial hosts with which they also co

16
00:00:53,471 --> 00:00:57,610
evolve.
So this has been tested and it works.

17
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:03,520
Another possibility is to manipulate
bacterial public goods so that cheaters

18
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:06,280
invade and cooperators
cannot take over again.

19
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:09,970
And to a certain degree,
in fact,

20
00:01:09,971 --> 00:01:12,970
successful infection
depends upon cooperation.

21
00:01:12,971 --> 00:01:15,460
It depends upon social
behavior by bacteria.

22
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:19,060
So if we can disrupt
bacterial social behavior,

23
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,600
we may be able to produce an type
of treatment that doesn't elicit an

24
00:01:25,781 --> 00:01:26,980
evolutionary response.

25
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,120
So the first idea is don't
wipe out the competition.

26
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,980
Use No more selection than is
necessary to cure the patient.

27
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:37,840
Okay.

28
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,430
This preserves clones of less virulent
pathogens that then compete with and

29
00:01:42,431 --> 00:01:47,170
suppress the more Varian went ones and it
slows down the evolution of resistance.

30
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:49,550
Yeah.

31
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:53,790
Andrew Reed gave a great Ted Med talk
on this. You can find it easily online.

32
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,960
The second possibility is phage therapy.

33
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:03,470
So here is a picture of a phage is a
virus that attacks bacteria but does not

34
00:02:04,831 --> 00:02:06,390
attack you. Carry Out. Excels.

35
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:08,773
Yeah.

36
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,380
Face have several advantages.
First,

37
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:14,350
they multiply exponentially
as do bacteria.

38
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:19,530
So a small initial dose of Phage will
multiply as they infect the bacteria and

39
00:02:19,781 --> 00:02:24,070
that diminishes the need for repeated
administrations. In other words,

40
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,700
the dose self adjusts to the
intensity of the infection.

41
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,860
Phage also mutate during
replication as do bacteria.

42
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:37,210
So that produces new phase.
They can recognize altered bacteria.

43
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:40,990
In other words, bacteria
can't run away, uh,

44
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,900
genetically from the Phage.
The phage keep up with them.

45
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,930
Unlike traditional antibiotics which
kill useful bacteria that help us digest

46
00:02:49,931 --> 00:02:51,430
food and produce vitamins.

47
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:55,750
Phage can be used to
target specific bacteria,

48
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:59,140
which reduces the chance that
useful bacteria are killed.

49
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,550
One of the problems with antibiotic
treatment is that it wipes out most of the

50
00:03:03,551 --> 00:03:08,551
Microbiota and that allows resistant
strains of things like c difficile to

51
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:12,640
invade that problem can be
avoided with phage therapy.

52
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,093
Okay,

53
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:16,180
here is a timeline.

54
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:20,290
It's a long timeline and so it's small
and a little bit difficult to read.

55
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:22,000
I'll step through some of the high points.

56
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,250
The point is that phage therapy has a
long history and has had some success.

57
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:33,030
So phase were discovered about 1915
already in the 1920s they were being used

58
00:03:36,971 --> 00:03:39,640
for therapy,
so there were experimental treatments

59
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:45,530
in the 1930s there were studies
of commercial feeds production.

60
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:49,111
However,

61
00:03:49,111 --> 00:03:54,111
in the 1930s also the council
on pharmacy and chemistry,

62
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:59,510
which had a self interest in using
chemicals rather than phage concluded that

63
00:04:00,331 --> 00:04:02,340
phage therapy is of questionable value.

64
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,570
In Eastern Europe.

65
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:11,450
There was an institute that was founded
to study experimental phage infections,

66
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:16,451
but in the 1940s the antibiotic
revolution came along and antibiotics then

67
00:04:18,171 --> 00:04:20,090
overshadowed phage therapy.

68
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:26,380
In the 1980s experiments were done that
show that phage can be more effective

69
00:04:26,451 --> 00:04:28,280
than antibiotics in some cases.

70
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,583
Okay.

71
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:37,260
In the 1980s the institute of Immunology
and experimental therapy in roll call

72
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:42,210
and Poland began treating humans with
phage therapy and over the next 20 years,

73
00:04:42,211 --> 00:04:45,090
more than 1800 patients
were treated successfully.

74
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:52,460
More recently there has been phage
therapy for Vancomycin resistant bacteria

75
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,240
infections that were,

76
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:59,300
these experiments were done in mice and
also for methicillin resistant staph

77
00:04:59,941 --> 00:05:00,774
Aureus.

78
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:05,780
So this is a promising technique and
it's one that bacteria cannot evolve

79
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:08,280
defenses against.

80
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,113
Okay.

81
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:14,710
So while the US and other countries
we're investing in antibiotics,

82
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,310
the Russians actually used
phage to treat bacteria.

83
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:24,210
Most studies show phage can be just as
effective as antibiotics and clinical

84
00:05:24,431 --> 00:05:26,440
studies are starting in the United States.

85
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,300
Yeah.

86
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,870
Phage were recently approved for
protecting humans from beef that has been

87
00:05:31,871 --> 00:05:35,410
contaminated with a
virulent strain of eco line.

88
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:37,060
Yeah.

89
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,910
And here are just a few
full photos to evoke.

90
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:45,570
Some of the cases in which phage therapy
has benefit effective for field wounds

91
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:52,180
for cholera and to sterilize
beef infected by equal one

92
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:57,250
phage therapy has both pros and cons.

93
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:03,140
Phage kill bacteria, they can't recover.
They automatically adjust their dosing.

94
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,450
They have low inherent toxicity.

95
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,870
The minimally disrupt
our commensal Microbiota.

96
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:12,350
There is no biproduct
resistance evolution.

97
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,880
They can be rapidly discovered
with screening approaches.

98
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,310
They can be applied flexibly,

99
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:22,790
they can clear out biofilms
that resist antibiotics.

100
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:26,120
There is potential for
just using a single dose.

101
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,830
There's a potential to transmit
protection to other patients.

102
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,300
There's little environmental impact
and they have low cost. However,

103
00:06:35,301 --> 00:06:39,890
there are some problems.
Non Lytic phage are inappropriate.

104
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,010
It shouldn't be used.
They're narrow.

105
00:06:43,011 --> 00:06:45,980
Host ranges can sometimes
be disadvantageous.

106
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:50,780
If you don't know which bacterium you have
precisely than the phage may not work.

107
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,550
They can evolve and they can
interact with our immune system.

108
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,700
However,
live attenuated vaccines do the same.

109
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:03,610
Now

110
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:08,610
the use of Phage for therapy against
bacterial infections also reminds us that

111
00:07:10,001 --> 00:07:14,860
phage can be used to attack cancer
and there are some oncolytic viruses.

112
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,430
The idea is that you can have an inoculum,

113
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:22,810
which is these little purple dots.
Here are the virus going in.

114
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:28,560
The virus is a cancer cell living among
a bunch of normal cells and the idea is

115
00:07:30,221 --> 00:07:35,140
to target the phage only to hit the
cancer cells and to leave the normal cells

116
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,063
on effected.

117
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:42,320
There are nonpathogenic viruses that
are being developed for this kind of

118
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:43,183
therapy.

119
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:49,180
They have none of the side effects of
chemotherapy and mouse studies of this are

120
00:07:49,281 --> 00:07:50,114
very promising.

121
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:57,070
VSV is one candidate for the
use in human anticancer therapy.

122
00:07:59,610 --> 00:07:59,920
Okay?

123
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,240
Okay.
Back to bacteria.

124
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:06,930
The third strategy for controlling
bacterial infections without producing an

125
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:12,070
evolutionary response is to
manipulate bacterial public goods.

126
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:17,500
So a public good is something that's
produced at a caused by an individual.

127
00:08:17,501 --> 00:08:22,150
The benefits of the population as a whole
bacteria produce at least two kinds of

128
00:08:22,151 --> 00:08:22,984
public goods,

129
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:27,460
molecules that signal the density
of the local population and side.

130
00:08:27,461 --> 00:08:31,600
Dara fours that scavenge iron from the
medium bacteria need iron for their

131
00:08:31,601 --> 00:08:35,680
metabolism. Now, both of these
are very Ellen's factors.

132
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:39,880
Bacteria will not attack host tissue
unless they sense that they are abundant

133
00:08:39,881 --> 00:08:44,440
enough to overcome the host immune
system and they need the iron to grow and

134
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:45,274
reproduce.

135
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:51,120
So what you can see here is a diagram in
which bacteria are producing molecules

136
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:57,990
where the molecule by one cell
is also being used by another.

137
00:08:57,991 --> 00:08:58,824
So

138
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,473
yeah,

139
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:06,880
if we can quench these virulence
factors outside the cells that has some

140
00:09:06,981 --> 00:09:07,814
advantages,

141
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,010
extracellular action avoids resistance
based on transport through the bacterial

142
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:17,120
cell wall. So we don't have to worry
about coevolution of the cell wall.

143
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,550
Any fitness benefit to an emerging Mutan
will be diluted across all local cells.

144
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,680
As with any other public good

145
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:32,650
because of quenching agent may not
have previously been experienced.

146
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:36,580
That resistance has not evolved to
that particular quenching agent.

147
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:41,830
And this idea has been tested with gallium
treatments of pseudomonas infections

148
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:42,664
and it works.

149
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:47,910
Gallium is quenching the iron uptake
inside era fours and by flooding the

150
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:53,710
infection,
uh,

151
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:58,740
with gallium pseudomonas loses the
benefit of producing side era fours.

152
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,450
They aren't doing any good anymore.

153
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:07,050
So there's invasion by the variance that
aren't producing side era fours because

154
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,110
they don't have any advantage,
but they're costly.

155
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:15,760
The variants that don't produce
them invade. Once that is done,

156
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,440
the public good is knocked out.

157
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,070
Okay.

158
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:25,180
Okay. To summarize, because pathogens
rapidly evolve, resistance to drugs,

159
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:29,530
therapies are being explored to do
not elicit an evolutionary response.

160
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:34,510
Evolution can be slowed by
not treating too intensely.

161
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:37,510
This runs counter to conventional wisdom.

162
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:38,790
Yeah.

163
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:43,620
Phage therapy is promising and I
think certainly deserves a lot more

164
00:10:43,621 --> 00:10:44,490
exploration.

165
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:46,040
Okay.

166
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:51,040
Disruption of bacterial public goods has
worked in a model system and might be

167
00:10:51,081 --> 00:10:54,140
something that could be
carried out in a real patient.

168
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,010
I think that also deserves
more ex exploration.
