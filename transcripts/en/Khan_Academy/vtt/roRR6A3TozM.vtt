00:00:00.213 --> 00:00:01.413
- [Voiceover] So I have talked a lot

00:00:01.413 --> 00:00:03.038
about different ways
that you can visualize

00:00:03.038 --> 00:00:04.272
multivariable functions.

00:00:04.272 --> 00:00:07.083
Functions that will have
some kind of multidimensional

00:00:07.083 --> 00:00:08.917
input or output.

00:00:08.917 --> 00:00:10.520
These include three-dimensional graphs,

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:11.336
which are very common.

00:00:11.336 --> 00:00:14.011
Contour maps, vector fields,
parametric functions.

00:00:14.011 --> 00:00:15.489
But here, I want to talk about

00:00:15.489 --> 00:00:16.854
one of my all-time favorite ways

00:00:16.854 --> 00:00:19.882
to think about functions,
which is as a transformation.

00:00:19.882 --> 00:00:22.366
So any time you have
some sort of function,

00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:24.179
if you're thinking very abstractly,

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:26.394
I like to think that there's
some sort of input space.

00:00:26.394 --> 00:00:28.866
And I'll draw it as a blob, even though,

00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:30.235
you know, that could be
the real number line.

00:00:30.235 --> 00:00:31.028
So it should be a line,

00:00:31.028 --> 00:00:32.373
or it could be three-dimensional space.

00:00:32.373 --> 00:00:34.428
And then there's some
kind of output space.

00:00:34.428 --> 00:00:36.856
And again, I just very vaguely
think about it as this blob.

00:00:37.796 --> 00:00:40.053
But that could be, again,
the real number line,

00:00:40.053 --> 00:00:42.069
the x-y plane, a three-dimensional space.

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:43.529
And the function is just some way

00:00:43.529 --> 00:00:45.542
of taking inputs to outputs.

00:00:45.542 --> 00:00:48.547
And every time that we're
trying to visualize something,

00:00:48.547 --> 00:00:50.403
like with a graph or a contour map,

00:00:50.403 --> 00:00:53.367
you're just trying to
associate input-ouput pairs.

00:00:53.367 --> 00:00:55.573
You know, if f inputs, you know,

00:00:55.573 --> 00:00:58.889
three gets mapped to the vector one-two.

00:00:58.889 --> 00:01:00.782
It's a question of how do you associate

00:01:00.782 --> 00:01:03.174
the number three with that vector one-two.

00:01:03.174 --> 00:01:04.800
And the thought behind transformations

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.095
is that we're just gonna
watch the actual points

00:01:08.095 --> 00:01:10.943
of the input space move
to the output space.

00:01:10.943 --> 00:01:12.284
And I'll start with a simple example

00:01:12.284 --> 00:01:14.668
that's just a one-dimensional function.

00:01:14.668 --> 00:01:16.416
It will have a single variable input.

00:01:16.416 --> 00:01:18.068
And it will have a single variable output.

00:01:21.424 --> 00:01:23.813
So let's consider the function f of x

00:01:25.273 --> 00:01:27.743
is equal to x squared minus three.

00:01:30.024 --> 00:01:31.613
And, of course, the way
we're used to visualizing

00:01:31.613 --> 00:01:33.156
something like this,
it will be as a graph.

00:01:33.156 --> 00:01:34.863
You might kind of be thinking of something

00:01:34.863 --> 00:01:36.855
roughly parabolic that's
squished down by three.

00:01:36.855 --> 00:01:39.254
But here, I don't want to
think in terms of graphs.

00:01:39.254 --> 00:01:40.447
I just want to say,

00:01:40.447 --> 00:01:42.745
how do the inputs move to those outputs?

00:01:42.745 --> 00:01:45.621
So as an example, if you go to zero,

00:01:45.621 --> 00:01:48.159
when you plug in zero, you're
gonna get negative three.

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:50.237
You know, zero squared minus three

00:01:50.237 --> 00:01:51.387
is equal to negative three.

00:01:52.977 --> 00:01:57.449
So somehow we want to watch
zero move to negative three.

00:01:57.449 --> 00:01:59.269
And then similarly, let's
say you plug in one,

00:01:59.269 --> 00:02:01.886
and you get one squared
minus three is negative two.

00:02:01.886 --> 00:02:05.744
So somehow we want to watch
one move to negative two.

00:02:06.854 --> 00:02:09.153
Just another example here.

00:02:09.153 --> 00:02:11.318
Let's say you are
plugging in three itself.

00:02:11.318 --> 00:02:16.172
So three squared minus three

00:02:16.172 --> 00:02:18.246
is nine minus three is six.

00:02:18.246 --> 00:02:19.771
So somehow in this transformation,

00:02:19.771 --> 00:02:23.319
we want to watch three
move to the number six.

00:02:26.917 --> 00:02:29.456
And with a little animation,
we can watch this happen.

00:02:29.456 --> 00:02:31.020
We can actually watch what it looks like

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.269
for all these numbers to move

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:34.451
to their corresponding outputs.

00:02:34.451 --> 00:02:35.850
So here we go.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.655
Each number will move over

00:02:38.705 --> 00:02:40.110
and land on its output.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.792
And I'll clear up the board here.

00:02:45.882 --> 00:02:48.415
So I kept track of what the
original input numbers are

00:02:48.415 --> 00:02:50.549
by just kind of writing them on top here.

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:52.251
And that was a way of just
watching how it moves.

00:02:52.251 --> 00:02:52.946
And I'll play it again.

00:02:52.946 --> 00:02:54.701
Here, let's just watch where

00:02:56.031 --> 00:02:58.507
each number from the input space

00:02:58.507 --> 00:03:00.134
moves over to the output.

00:03:01.244 --> 00:03:03.229
And with single variable functions,

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:05.127
this is a little bit nice
because it gives the sense

00:03:05.127 --> 00:03:06.842
of inputs moving to outputs.

00:03:06.842 --> 00:03:08.509
But where it gets fun is

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:10.964
in the context of multivariable functions.

00:03:10.964 --> 00:03:14.204
So now, let me consider
a function that has

00:03:14.204 --> 00:03:18.108
a one-dimensional input and
a two-dimensional output.

00:03:18.108 --> 00:03:20.891
And specifically, it will be f of x

00:03:21.781 --> 00:03:25.066
is equal to cosine of x,

00:03:25.986 --> 00:03:28.185
cosine of x.

00:03:28.185 --> 00:03:29.548
And then the y component will be

00:03:29.548 --> 00:03:30.887
x sine of y.

00:03:33.816 --> 00:03:35.208
Sorry, x sine of x.

00:03:39.097 --> 00:03:41.405
So just to think about a couple examples.

00:03:41.405 --> 00:03:43.211
If you plug in something like zero,

00:03:43.211 --> 00:03:44.995
and think about where zero ought to go,

00:03:47.665 --> 00:03:49.297
you'd have f of zero

00:03:51.557 --> 00:03:53.925
is equal to cosine of zero is one.

00:03:54.875 --> 00:03:57.702
And then, zero times anything is zero.

00:03:57.702 --> 00:03:59.426
So somehow we're gonna watch zero

00:03:59.426 --> 00:04:01.876
move over to the point one-zero.

00:04:01.876 --> 00:04:04.106
And so this is where
we expect zero to land.

00:04:04.106 --> 00:04:06.315
And let's think about, like, pi.

00:04:06.315 --> 00:04:08.464
So f of pi.

00:04:14.007 --> 00:04:16.067
Then cosine of pi is negative one.

00:04:17.818 --> 00:04:19.697
This is gonna be pi multiplied by,

00:04:19.697 --> 00:04:21.240
and sine of pi is zero.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.419
So that will again be zero.

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:26.087
So, you know, this little
guy is where zero lands.

00:04:26.087 --> 00:04:28.169
And we expect that this is gonna be where

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:29.408
the value pi lands.

00:04:31.288 --> 00:04:32.657
And if we watch this take place,

00:04:32.657 --> 00:04:35.207
and we actually watch each
element of the input space

00:04:35.207 --> 00:04:37.602
move over to the output space,

00:04:37.602 --> 00:04:38.960
we get something like this.

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.441
And again, this is just kind of a nice way

00:04:46.441 --> 00:04:47.854
to think about what's actually going on.

00:04:47.854 --> 00:04:49.089
You might ask questions about whether

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:52.936
the space ends up getting
stretched or squished.

00:04:52.936 --> 00:04:55.548
And notice that this is
also what a parametric plot

00:04:55.548 --> 00:04:56.696
of this function would look like.

00:04:56.696 --> 00:04:58.275
If you interpret it as
a parametric function,

00:04:58.275 --> 00:04:59.799
this is what you get in the end.

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:02.257
But whereas in parametrics plots,

00:05:02.257 --> 00:05:03.690
you lose input information,

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.721
here you can kind of see where things move

00:05:05.721 --> 00:05:08.045
as you go from one to the other.

00:05:08.045 --> 00:05:09.118
And in the next video,

00:05:09.118 --> 00:05:11.190
I'm gonna talk about how
you can interpret functions

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.668
with a two-dimensional input

00:05:12.668 --> 00:05:13.986
and a two-dimensional output

00:05:13.986 --> 00:05:15.591
as a transformation.
