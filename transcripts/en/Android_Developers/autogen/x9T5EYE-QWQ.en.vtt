Android studio you already heard a fair

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390
Android studio you already heard a fair
 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.150
Android studio you already heard a fair
bit about whatever it is and how you can

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160
bit about whatever it is and how you can
 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.189
bit about whatever it is and how you can
use it and today I don't want to talk

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199
use it and today I don't want to talk
 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.200
use it and today I don't want to talk
too much actually what our rate is I

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210
too much actually what our rate is I
 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.920
too much actually what our rate is I
want to focus more on keep rules so what

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930
want to focus more on keep rules so what
 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.110
want to focus more on keep rules so what
are keep rules keep rules is the

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120
are keep rules keep rules is the
 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.030
are keep rules keep rules is the
configuration language that ProGuard

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040
configuration language that ProGuard
 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.000
configuration language that ProGuard
uses to specify the things you need to

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010
uses to specify the things you need to
 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.260

keep in your application while shrinking
and when we build our rate we decided we

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610
and when we build our rate we decided we
 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.400
and when we build our rate we decided we
wanted to use the same language because

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410
wanted to use the same language because
 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.139
wanted to use the same language because
we wanted to be a drop-in replacement

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149
we wanted to be a drop-in replacement
 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.360
we wanted to be a drop-in replacement
for ProGuard the idea being that he

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370
for ProGuard the idea being that he
 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.639
for ProGuard the idea being that he
could just reuse your existing rules and

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649
could just reuse your existing rules and
 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.270
could just reuse your existing rules and
try our aid really easily nice you might

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280
try our aid really easily nice you might
 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.889
try our aid really easily nice you might
imagine building something that is

imagine building something that is
compatible to that degree required us to

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329
compatible to that degree required us to
 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.540
compatible to that degree required us to
quite deeply understand what program

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550
quite deeply understand what program
 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.119
quite deeply understand what program
rules actually mean and today I want to

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129
rules actually mean and today I want to
 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.160
rules actually mean and today I want to
use this opportunity to share some of

use this opportunity to share some of
 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.990
use this opportunity to share some of
that knowledge with you and I also want

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000
that knowledge with you and I also want
 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.490
that knowledge with you and I also want
to take on a little journey to

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500
to take on a little journey to
 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.530
to take on a little journey to
understand what it really takes given an

understand what it really takes given an
 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.420
understand what it really takes given an
application to come up with effective

keep rules to shrink it to its minimum
 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.390
keep rules to shrink it to its minimum
but before we go there let me ask you

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400
but before we go there let me ask you
 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.219
but before we go there let me ask you
all the questions so who of you has used

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229
all the questions so who of you has used
 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.700
all the questions so who of you has used
ProGuard before in some way or shape wow

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710
ProGuard before in some way or shape wow
 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.670
ProGuard before in some way or shape wow
that's a lot of people so who of you is

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680
that's a lot of people so who of you is
 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.310
that's a lot of people so who of you is
using ProGuard today in a released

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320
using ProGuard today in a released
 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.240
using ProGuard today in a released
production app on the Play Store that's

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250
production app on the Play Store that's
 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.830
production app on the Play Store that's
really little less but you're a great

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840
really little less but you're a great
 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.870
really little less but you're a great
crowd thank you for doing that because

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880
crowd thank you for doing that because
 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.140
crowd thank you for doing that because
our estimates show that only about a

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150
our estimates show that only about a
 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.700
our estimates show that only about a
quarter of applications on the Play

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710
quarter of applications on the Play
 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.760
quarter of applications on the Play
Store actually use keep rules so there's

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770
Store actually use keep rules so there's
 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.609
Store actually use keep rules so there's
a big room for improvement and I want to

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619
a big room for improvement and I want to
 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.080
a big room for improvement and I want to
talk a little bit about why it actually

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090
talk a little bit about why it actually
 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.870
talk a little bit about why it actually
matters to shrink application size so of

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880
matters to shrink application size so of
 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.340
matters to shrink application size so of
course for me it matters because I

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350
course for me it matters because I
 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.719
course for me it matters because I
helped build the shrinker right I'm

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729
helped build the shrinker right I'm
 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.850
helped build the shrinker right I'm
interested that somebody uses it but it

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860
interested that somebody uses it but it
 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.679
interested that somebody uses it but it
should also matter for you there has

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689
should also matter for you there has
 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.170
should also matter for you there has
been a lot of talk about next billion

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180
been a lot of talk about next billion
 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.630
been a lot of talk about next billion
users entry level Android devices and

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640
users entry level Android devices and
 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.620
users entry level Android devices and
how we can make their user experience

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630
how we can make their user experience
 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.859
how we can make their user experience
better and what makes an entry level

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869
better and what makes an entry level
 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.700
better and what makes an entry level
user Android device so one thing is

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710
user Android device so one thing is
 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.770
user Android device so one thing is
it's really resource-limited so if you

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780
it's really resource-limited so if you
 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.840
it's really resource-limited so if you
think of these devices they typically

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850
think of these devices they typically
 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.540
think of these devices they typically
have as less as 512 megabytes of RAM or

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550
have as less as 512 megabytes of RAM or
 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.910
have as less as 512 megabytes of RAM or
they might only have like 4 gigabytes of

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920
they might only have like 4 gigabytes of
 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.640
they might only have like 4 gigabytes of
storage and quite often people that use

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650
storage and quite often people that use
 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.490
storage and quite often people that use
these devices on areas where they have

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500
these devices on areas where they have
 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.520
these devices on areas where they have
very limited connectivity so for these

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530
very limited connectivity so for these
 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.560
very limited connectivity so for these
users size actually makes a daily

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570
users size actually makes a daily
 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.260
users size actually makes a daily
difference right when they decide of all

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270
difference right when they decide of all
 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.750
difference right when they decide of all
the apps they actually want to use which

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020
might be a small subset and that's bad
 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.240
might be a small subset and that's bad
for them because it's a bad user

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250
for them because it's a bad user
 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.430
for them because it's a bad user

experience but it's also really bad for
 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.770

you as application developers because it

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780
you as application developers because it
 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.150
you as application developers because it

cuts it might be your app that they
actually want to use but they can't use

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880
actually want to use but they can't use
 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.280
actually want to use but they can't use
because they don't have the space now

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290
because they don't have the space now
 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.650
because they don't have the space now
you might say ok that's not really my

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660
you might say ok that's not really my
 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.110
you might say ok that's not really my
audience next billion users entry level

that's not where I'd see my application

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950
that's not where I'd see my application
 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.970
that's not where I'd see my application
but even if your target really high end

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980
but even if your target really high end
 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.730
but even if your target really high end
devices the fundamental truth is that

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740
devices the fundamental truth is that
 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.000
devices the fundamental truth is that
smaller is always faster and that's

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010
smaller is always faster and that's
 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.550
smaller is always faster and that's
quite obvious because a they download

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560
quite obvious because a they download
 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.380
quite obvious because a they download
faster because they're smaller there's

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390
faster because they're smaller there's
 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.720
faster because they're smaller there's
less to transfer they also install a lot

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730
less to transfer they also install a lot
 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.160
less to transfer they also install a lot
faster because there's less code to

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170
faster because there's less code to
 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.320
faster because there's less code to
compile and that what takes the time at

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330
compile and that what takes the time at
 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.620
compile and that what takes the time at
installing and lastly and that's what

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630
installing and lastly and that's what
 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.020

users see every day they also start up

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030
users see every day they also start up
 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.120
users see every day they also start up
much faster because there's less code to

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130
much faster because there's less code to
 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.870
much faster because there's less code to

here why did we go from 60 K flying to
 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.750
here why did we go from 60 K flying to
the moon to 4 megabytes rendering a

the moon to 4 megabytes rendering a
 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.270
the moon to 4 megabytes rendering a

I wanted was immutable collections

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:12.720
I wanted was immutable collections
 

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.030
I wanted was immutable collections
because I thought my static weather data

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:15.040
because I thought my static weather data
 

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.890
because I thought my static weather data
its static so it should be an immutable

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:16.900
its static so it should be an immutable
 

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:18.719
its static so it should be an immutable
collection right that's good software

00:07:18.719 --> 00:07:18.729
collection right that's good software
 

00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:21.270

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:27.090

probably lots more of plotting libraries

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:27.100
probably lots more of plotting libraries
 

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.460
probably lots more of plotting libraries
but I'd spotted this one the first an

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:54.960
technically this is correct you put this
in there and it will compile but there's

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:54.970
in there and it will compile but there's
 

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:57.870
in there and it will compile but there's
a problem what this tells our aid is no

00:10:57.870 --> 00:10:57.880
a problem what this tells our aid is no
 

00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.850
a problem what this tells our aid is no
matter what happens don't tell me about

00:10:59.850 --> 00:10:59.860
matter what happens don't tell me about
 

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:02.400
matter what happens don't tell me about
it and that means it will mask these

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:02.410
it and that means it will mask these
 

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:04.200
it and that means it will mask these
benign errors but it will also really

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:04.210
benign errors but it will also really
 

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:06.480
benign errors but it will also really
mask all the errors you actually care

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:06.490
mask all the errors you actually care
 

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:08.870
mask all the errors you actually care
about where something went wrong

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:08.880
about where something went wrong
 

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:12.449
about where something went wrong
so how can we improve on this and to do

00:11:12.449 --> 00:11:12.459
so how can we improve on this and to do
 

00:11:12.459 --> 00:11:15.810
so how can we improve on this and to do
that we have to actually deep dive a bit

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:15.820
that we have to actually deep dive a bit
 

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:19.230
that we have to actually deep dive a bit
into how our a it works now I will talk

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:19.240

the same problem so what does our I do

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:27.670
the same problem so what does our I do
 

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:29.910
the same problem so what does our I do
it has two things firstly it does

obfuscation but it really doesn't

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:41.920
obfuscation but it really doesn't
 

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.490
obfuscation but it really doesn't
obfuscate your code it just makes it a

00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:44.500
obfuscate your code it just makes it a
 

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:46.620
obfuscate your code it just makes it a
little less hard to read but it's

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:46.630
little less hard to read but it's
 

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:49.769

that's one thing Prager does but I don't

00:11:53.939 --> 00:11:53.949
that's one thing Prager does but I don't
 

00:11:53.949 --> 00:11:55.290
that's one thing Prager does but I don't
want to focus too much on that

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:55.300
want to focus too much on that

the other thing it does is shrinking now

00:11:58.290 --> 00:11:58.300
the other thing it does is shrinking now
 

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.360
the other thing it does is shrinking now
shrinking is a great name for this from

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:00.370
shrinking is a great name for this from
 

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:02.189
shrinking is a great name for this from
like a developer perspective because it

00:12:02.189 --> 00:12:02.199
like a developer perspective because it
 

00:12:02.199 --> 00:12:04.439
like a developer perspective because it
takes your app and it shrinks it into a

00:12:04.439 --> 00:12:04.449
takes your app and it shrinks it into a
 

00:12:04.449 --> 00:12:06.900
takes your app and it shrinks it into a
smaller app if you actually want to

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:06.910
smaller app if you actually want to
 

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:08.519
smaller app if you actually want to

just yet another thing on these graphs

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:38.560
just yet another thing on these graphs
 

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:40.740
just yet another thing on these graphs
is that everything on your right is

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:40.750
is that everything on your right is
 

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:43.259
is that everything on your right is
library classes that's part of the

00:12:43.259 --> 00:12:43.269
library classes that's part of the
 

00:12:43.269 --> 00:12:45.329
library classes that's part of the
younger it system and everything on the

00:12:45.329 --> 00:12:45.339
younger it system and everything on the
 

00:12:45.339 --> 00:12:49.199
younger it system and everything on the
left is your application code and the

00:12:49.199 --> 00:12:49.209
left is your application code and the
 

00:12:49.209 --> 00:12:51.090
left is your application code and the
first thing to realize here is that

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:51.100
first thing to realize here is that
 

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:54.290
first thing to realize here is that
library classes are always live and

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:54.300
library classes are always live and
 

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:56.579
library classes are always live and
that's a very practical reason for us

00:12:56.579 --> 00:12:56.589
that's a very practical reason for us
 

00:12:56.589 --> 00:12:59.100
that's a very practical reason for us
because we can't shrink them away anyway

00:12:59.100 --> 00:12:59.110
because we can't shrink them away anyway
 

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:00.929
because we can't shrink them away anyway
they're on the phone they're part of the

00:13:00.929 --> 00:13:00.939
they're on the phone they're part of the
 

00:13:00.939 --> 00:13:03.629
they're on the phone they're part of the
system but there's also a technical

00:13:03.629 --> 00:13:03.639
system but there's also a technical
 

00:13:03.639 --> 00:13:05.610
system but there's also a technical
reason because for a static analysis

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:05.620
reason because for a static analysis
 

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:07.559
reason because for a static analysis
tool we don't know what these library

00:13:07.559 --> 00:13:07.569
tool we don't know what these library
 

00:13:07.569 --> 00:13:10.439
tool we don't know what these library
classes actually do and that is because

00:13:10.439 --> 00:13:10.449
classes actually do and that is because
 

00:13:10.449 --> 00:13:12.120
classes actually do and that is because
the runtime might call into them at any

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:12.130
the runtime might call into them at any
 

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:13.980
the runtime might call into them at any
point there's very many different

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:13.990
point there's very many different
 

00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:15.540
point there's very many different
libraries like different Android

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:15.550
libraries like different Android
 

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:17.340
libraries like different Android
versions and they also might change in

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:17.350
versions and they also might change in
 

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:17.960
versions and they also might change in
the future

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:17.970
the future
 

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:20.790
the future
so from an analysis standpoint we just

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:20.800
so from an analysis standpoint we just
 

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.020
so from an analysis standpoint we just
have to assume that

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:22.030
have to assume that
 

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:26.010
have to assume that
library classes are always life so let's

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:26.020
library classes are always life so let's
 

00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:28.410
library classes are always life so let's
assume we will start our app by calling

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:28.420
assume we will start our app by calling
 

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:32.520
assume we will start our app by calling
the run method in the air class so the

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:32.530
the run method in the air class so the
 

00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:33.900
the run method in the air class so the
first thing we will have to do to

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:33.910
first thing we will have to do to
 

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:35.310
first thing we will have to do to
actually do this is we have to

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:35.320
actually do this is we have to
 

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:38.640
actually do this is we have to
instantiate this F class which means we

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:38.650
instantiate this F class which means we
 

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:40.710
instantiate this F class which means we
create an instance of the class app and

00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:40.720
create an instance of the class app and
 

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:44.160
create an instance of the class app and
we also call the constructor and that

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:44.170
we also call the constructor and that
 

00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:47.280
we also call the constructor and that
leads to both of them being live that

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:47.290
leads to both of them being live that
 

00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:48.780
leads to both of them being live that
means we cannot strip away the app class

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:48.790
means we cannot strip away the app class
 

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:50.670
means we cannot strip away the app class
and we cannot strip away the constructor

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:50.680
and we cannot strip away the constructor
 

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:54.510
and we cannot strip away the constructor
so far so good next we have to actually

00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:54.520
so far so good next we have to actually
 

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.190
so far so good next we have to actually
look at the code of the constructor to

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:56.200
look at the code of the constructor to
 

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:58.680
look at the code of the constructor to
see what it will do at run time and if

00:13:58.680 --> 00:13:58.690
see what it will do at run time and if
 

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:00.480
see what it will do at run time and if
you look at the code you will see it

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:00.490
you look at the code you will see it
 

00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:02.100
you look at the code you will see it
actually creates a new instance of class

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:02.110
actually creates a new instance of class
 

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:06.930
actually creates a new instance of class
a so again this makes class a become a

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:06.940
a so again this makes class a become a
 

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:09.840
a so again this makes class a become a
life we can no longer remove it note

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:09.850
life we can no longer remove it note
 

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:11.400
life we can no longer remove it note
that class a doesn't actually have a

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:11.410
that class a doesn't actually have a
 

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:13.710
that class a doesn't actually have a
constructor so there's no code to look

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:13.720
constructor so there's no code to look
 

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.450
constructor so there's no code to look
at it only has a default constructor

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:15.460
at it only has a default constructor
 

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:18.720
at it only has a default constructor
that does nothing interesting here the

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:18.730
that does nothing interesting here the
 

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:20.190
that does nothing interesting here the
other thing that the constructor of the

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:20.200
other thing that the constructor of the
 

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.530
other thing that the constructor of the
app class does it writes the created

00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:22.540
app class does it writes the created
 

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:25.250
app class does it writes the created
instance to this field other field

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:25.260
instance to this field other field
 

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.510
instance to this field other field
it's interesting to note here that

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:27.520
it's interesting to note here that
 

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:29.300
it's interesting to note here that
doesn't actually make other field life

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:29.310
doesn't actually make other field life
 

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:31.710
doesn't actually make other field life
because writing to a field is not

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:31.720
because writing to a field is not
 

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.570
because writing to a field is not
observable you have to actually read the

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:33.580
observable you have to actually read the
 

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:37.860
observable you have to actually read the
field to know that the field exists so

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:37.870
field to know that the field exists so
 

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:39.150
field to know that the field exists so
now we've created the instance of this

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:39.160
now we've created the instance of this
 

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.130
now we've created the instance of this
app class we've executed the constructor

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:41.140
app class we've executed the constructor
 

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:43.410
app class we've executed the constructor
we want to call the run method and again

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:43.420
we want to call the run method and again
 

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:45.210
we want to call the run method and again
calling this run method will mark this

00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:45.220
calling this run method will mark this
 

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:48.510
calling this run method will mark this
method as life and with luck with every

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:48.520
method as life and with luck with every
 

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:50.160
method as life and with luck with every
other life method we now have to look at

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:50.170
other life method we now have to look at
 

00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:51.540
other life method we now have to look at
it and see what the code actually does

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:51.550
it and see what the code actually does
 

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:54.660
it and see what the code actually does
at runtime so if you look at run you

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:54.670
at runtime so if you look at run you
 

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:56.280
at runtime so if you look at run you
will see it first reads the field other

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:56.290
will see it first reads the field other
 

00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:58.410
will see it first reads the field other
fields to retrieve the instance and this

00:14:58.410 --> 00:14:58.420
fields to retrieve the instance and this
 

00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:00.030
fields to retrieve the instance and this
is the moment where this field actually

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:00.040
is the moment where this field actually
 

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:04.680
is the moment where this field actually
becomes live an X equal call a method on

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:04.690
becomes live an X equal call a method on
 

00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:07.140
becomes live an X equal call a method on
the retrieved instance and that is where

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:07.150
the retrieved instance and that is where
 

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:11.820
the retrieved instance and that is where
a method in class a becomes life and now

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:11.830
a method in class a becomes life and now
 

00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:13.290
a method in class a becomes life and now
we would look at the code of a method

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:13.300
we would look at the code of a method
 

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:15.570
we would look at the code of a method
see what that does and mark all those

00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:15.580
see what that does and mark all those
 

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:18.120
see what that does and mark all those
effects so this is how the basic

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:18.130
effects so this is how the basic
 

00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:20.760
effects so this is how the basic
analysis flow works whenever you think

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:20.770
analysis flow works whenever you think
 

00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:22.350
analysis flow works whenever you think
about keep rules you have to keep in

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:22.360
about keep rules you have to keep in
 

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:23.790
about keep rules you have to keep in
mind this is what your analysis engine

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:23.800
mind this is what your analysis engine
 

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:26.520
mind this is what your analysis engine
will do now how does this relate to

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:26.530
will do now how does this relate to
 

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:29.010
will do now how does this relate to
Android how do we actually know the

00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:29.020
Android how do we actually know the
 

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:31.880
Android how do we actually know the
entry point of an Android application

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:31.890
entry point of an Android application
 

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:34.810
entry point of an Android application
well that comes from your manifest file

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:34.820
well that comes from your manifest file
 

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:37.030
well that comes from your manifest file
so this is a very simplified manifest

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:37.040
so this is a very simplified manifest
 

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:39.250
so this is a very simplified manifest
file but one thing it does it tells you

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:39.260
file but one thing it does it tells you
 

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.880
file but one thing it does it tells you
that the activity has the class the

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:42.890
that the activity has the class the
 

00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:47.050
that the activity has the class the
graph as its implementation now neither

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:47.060
graph as its implementation now neither
 

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:49.690
graph as its implementation now neither
r8 nor Prague are to understand manifest

00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:49.700
r8 nor Prague are to understand manifest
 

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:52.270
r8 nor Prague are to understand manifest
files and they shouldn't because there's

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:52.280
files and they shouldn't because there's
 

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:53.790
files and they shouldn't because there's
a little tool that actually helps us

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:53.800
a little tool that actually helps us
 

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:56.820
a little tool that actually helps us
understand them and that's called a apt

00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:56.830
understand them and that's called a apt
 

00:15:56.830 --> 00:15:59.860
understand them and that's called a apt
apt during a build will precess

00:15:59.860 --> 00:15:59.870
apt during a build will precess
 

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:01.990
apt during a build will precess
pre-process all your resources and it

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:02.000
pre-process all your resources and it
 

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.470
pre-process all your resources and it
creates corresponding keep rules for you

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:04.480
creates corresponding keep rules for you
 

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:06.820
creates corresponding keep rules for you
so let's look at this keep roll and this

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:06.830
so let's look at this keep roll and this
 

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:08.770
so let's look at this keep roll and this
is the first people so I will talk a bit

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:08.780
is the first people so I will talk a bit
 

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:12.670
is the first people so I will talk a bit
about it in detail so what it basically

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:12.680
about it in detail so what it basically
 

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:15.220
about it in detail so what it basically
does is says keep that's the simplest

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:15.230
does is says keep that's the simplest
 

00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:17.260
does is says keep that's the simplest
form it says okay everything I mentioned

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:17.270
form it says okay everything I mentioned
 

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:19.030
form it says okay everything I mentioned
now you have to keep don't touch it

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:19.040
now you have to keep don't touch it
 

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:21.610
now you have to keep don't touch it
don't shrink it don't rename it and we

00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:21.620
don't shrink it don't rename it and we
 

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:24.220
don't shrink it don't rename it and we
want to keep a class and then we have a

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:24.230
want to keep a class and then we have a
 

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:26.740
want to keep a class and then we have a
fully qualified class name which is my

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:26.750
fully qualified class name which is my
 

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:29.580
fully qualified class name which is my
main class that came from this manifest

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:29.590
main class that came from this manifest
 

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:31.870
main class that came from this manifest
there's something more here adjust the

00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:31.880
there's something more here adjust the
 

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:34.480
there's something more here adjust the
class name would only keep the class it

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:34.490
class name would only keep the class it
 

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:35.920
class name would only keep the class it
wouldn't actually tell the system that

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:35.930
wouldn't actually tell the system that
 

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:38.410
wouldn't actually tell the system that
this class is also instantiated which is

00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:38.420
this class is also instantiated which is
 

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:41.050
this class is also instantiated which is
a big difference to tell it about that

00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:41.060
a big difference to tell it about that
 

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:42.460
a big difference to tell it about that
we also have to keep the Constructors

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:42.470
we also have to keep the Constructors
 

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:44.920
we also have to keep the Constructors
and that was this init line does so this

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:44.930
and that was this init line does so this
 

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:47.230
and that was this init line does so this
in it with the elided parameters tells

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:47.240
in it with the elided parameters tells
 

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:49.300
in it with the elided parameters tells
our eight we also need the constructors

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:49.310
our eight we also need the constructors
 

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:52.140
our eight we also need the constructors
and we will instantiate this at run time

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:52.150
and we will instantiate this at run time
 

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:54.520
and we will instantiate this at run time
so now our eight knows discusses life

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:54.530
so now our eight knows discusses life
 

00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:56.410
so now our eight knows discusses life
and as I said before it will look at the

00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:56.420
and as I said before it will look at the
 

00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:58.480
and as I said before it will look at the
code let's go there

00:16:58.480 --> 00:16:58.490
code let's go there
 

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:01.180
code let's go there
this is my the graph class and I've

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:01.190
this is my the graph class and I've
 

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:02.890
this is my the graph class and I've
removed all the function bodies and

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:02.900
removed all the function bodies and
 

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:05.530
removed all the function bodies and
everything that's not important but what

00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:05.540
everything that's not important but what
 

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:07.390
everything that's not important but what
you will see here is it actually doesn't

00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:07.400
you will see here is it actually doesn't
 

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:10.870
you will see here is it actually doesn't
have a constructor so that means our

00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:10.880
have a constructor so that means our
 

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:13.420
have a constructor so that means our
analysis ends right here we've seen the

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:13.430
analysis ends right here we've seen the
 

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:15.460
analysis ends right here we've seen the
class there is no constructor nothing to

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:15.470
class there is no constructor nothing to
 

00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:18.730
class there is no constructor nothing to
do now every one of you who's ever

00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:18.740
do now every one of you who's ever
 

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:20.470
do now every one of you who's ever
written an end or lab knows the actual

00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:20.480
written an end or lab knows the actual
 

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:22.420
written an end or lab knows the actual
meet happens in the oncreate method

00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:22.430
meet happens in the oncreate method
 

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:24.460
meet happens in the oncreate method
that's where the actual configuration

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:24.470
that's where the actual configuration
 

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:28.690
that's where the actual configuration
happens so how does r8 know the keep

00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:28.700
happens so how does r8 know the keep
 

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:30.340
happens so how does r8 know the keep
rule never told it to actually look at

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:30.350
rule never told it to actually look at
 

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:35.170
rule never told it to actually look at
on create what the trickier is that the

00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:35.180
on create what the trickier is that the
 

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:38.500
on create what the trickier is that the
graph extends this amp compared activity

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:38.510
graph extends this amp compared activity
 

00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:41.830
graph extends this amp compared activity
class and if you keep on following this

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:41.840
class and if you keep on following this
 

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:44.620
class and if you keep on following this
you will see that eventually that

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:44.630
you will see that eventually that
 

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:47.230
you will see that eventually that
extends activity

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:47.240
extends activity
 

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:49.810
extends activity
now activity is a library class and as I

00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:49.820
now activity is a library class and as I
 

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:51.760
now activity is a library class and as I
said before all library classes are

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:51.770
said before all library classes are
 

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:53.010
said before all library classes are
always life

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:53.020
always life
 

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:57.149
always life
hence this oncreate method is also life

00:17:57.149 --> 00:17:57.159
hence this oncreate method is also life
 

00:17:57.159 --> 00:17:59.440
hence this oncreate method is also life
but as these on create in the library

00:17:59.440 --> 00:17:59.450
but as these on create in the library
 

00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:02.380
but as these on create in the library
classes life all its overrides in life

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:02.390
classes life all its overrides in life
 

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:05.830
classes life all its overrides in life
subclasses also become life and that's

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:05.840
subclasses also become life and that's
 

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:07.240
subclasses also become life and that's
another thing of the analysis you have

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:07.250
another thing of the analysis you have
 

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:08.380
another thing of the analysis you have
to keep in mind if you want to

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:08.390
to keep in mind if you want to
 

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:10.870
to keep in mind if you want to
understand how it actually works so this

00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:10.880
understand how it actually works so this
 

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:14.529
understand how it actually works so this
is what marks on create life let's take

00:18:14.529 --> 00:18:14.539
is what marks on create life let's take
 

00:18:14.539 --> 00:18:16.659
is what marks on create life let's take
a look this is my own create method and

00:18:16.659 --> 00:18:16.669
a look this is my own create method and
 

00:18:16.669 --> 00:18:19.029
a look this is my own create method and
it looks like a standard on create

00:22:13.549 --> 00:22:13.559
work
 

00:22:13.559 --> 00:22:17.250
work
so adding these five rules we get our

00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:17.260
so adding these five rules we get our
 

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:20.460
so adding these five rules we get our
application to compile that wasn't bad

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:20.470
application to compile that wasn't bad
 

00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:21.960
application to compile that wasn't bad
right so we looked at better dead we

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:21.970
right so we looked at better dead we
 

00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:23.730
right so we looked at better dead we
added five rules and tada we have a

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:23.740
added five rules and tada we have a
 

00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:26.330
added five rules and tada we have a
small application

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:26.340
 

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:29.010
unfortunately the runtime behavior of my

00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:29.020
unfortunately the runtime behavior of my
 

00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:31.140
unfortunately the runtime behavior of my
application has changed just ever so

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:31.150
application has changed just ever so
 

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:33.710
application has changed just ever so
slightly because now it crashes and

00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:33.720
slightly because now it crashes and
 

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:35.700
slightly because now it crashes and
that's the other problem you typically

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:35.710
that's the other problem you typically
 

00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:40.919
that's the other problem you typically
see again what happened here right I

00:22:40.919 --> 00:22:40.929
see again what happened here right I
 

00:22:40.929 --> 00:22:42.630
see again what happened here right I
explained to you how the analysis works

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:42.640
explained to you how the analysis works
 

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:46.560
explained to you how the analysis works
that looked all fine and reasonable the

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:46.570
that looked all fine and reasonable the
 

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:51.150
that looked all fine and reasonable the
typical problem is reflection because by

00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:51.160
typical problem is reflection because by
 

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:52.799
typical problem is reflection because by
its mere nature reflection is about

00:22:52.799 --> 00:22:52.809
its mere nature reflection is about
 

00:22:52.809 --> 00:22:55.380
its mere nature reflection is about
using a dynamic runtime value to load a

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:55.390
using a dynamic runtime value to load a
 

00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:59.100
using a dynamic runtime value to load a
method or a clause in static analysis

00:22:59.100 --> 00:22:59.110
method or a clause in static analysis
 

00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:01.320
method or a clause in static analysis
just can't understand this dynamic

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:01.330
just can't understand this dynamic
 

00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:04.820
just can't understand this dynamic
values are the enemy of static analysis

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:04.830
values are the enemy of static analysis
 

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:08.430
values are the enemy of static analysis
so how do we fix this well we have to

00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:08.440
so how do we fix this well we have to
 

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:10.380
so how do we fix this well we have to
somehow figure out how to tell our aid

00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:10.390
somehow figure out how to tell our aid
 

00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:13.860
somehow figure out how to tell our aid
about these cases of reflection and make

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:13.870
about these cases of reflection and make
 

00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:15.780
about these cases of reflection and make
our aid understand them and that's

00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:15.790
our aid understand them and that's
 

00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:18.090
our aid understand them and that's
really what keep rules do so what did I

00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:18.100
really what keep rules do so what did I
 

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:18.510

big piece of advice if you write these
 

00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:44.060
big piece of advice if you write these
kind of libraries and you do reflection

00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:44.070

dispatch worked and then we get the name

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:08.580
dispatch worked and then we get the name
 

00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:13.690
dispatch worked and then we get the name
of this class and this seems to return a

00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:13.700
 

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:17.570
why did they name the class a well they

00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:17.580
why did they name the class a well they
 

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:17.990
why did they name the class a well they
didn't

00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:18.000
didn't
 

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.600
didn't
the problem is minification right r8

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:20.610
the problem is minification right r8
 

00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:22.730
the problem is minification right r8
went ahead saw this class and thought

00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:22.740
went ahead saw this class and thought
 

00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:25.270
went ahead saw this class and thought
well plot is a long name let's call it a

00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:25.280
well plot is a long name let's call it a
 

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:28.130
well plot is a long name let's call it a
so to fix this we have to prevent our

00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:28.140
so to fix this we have to prevent our
 

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:30.440
so to fix this we have to prevent our
aid from renaming this class or any of

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:30.450
aid from renaming this class or any of
 

00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:34.940
aid from renaming this class or any of
its subclasses and this is the

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:34.950
its subclasses and this is the
 

00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:36.440
its subclasses and this is the
corresponding keep rule

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:36.450
corresponding keep rule
 

00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:39.190
corresponding keep rule
so again what does it say it says keep

00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:39.200
so again what does it say it says keep
 

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:42.970
so again what does it say it says keep
class calm Android plot dot plot and

00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:42.980
class calm Android plot dot plot and
 

00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:45.739
class calm Android plot dot plot and
that means our age should keep the class

00:26:45.739 --> 00:26:45.749
that means our age should keep the class
 

00:26:45.749 --> 00:26:49.039
that means our age should keep the class
not rename it not optimize it but as I

00:26:49.039 --> 00:26:49.049
not rename it not optimize it but as I
 

00:26:49.049 --> 00:26:50.299
not rename it not optimize it but as I
said we also have to keep all the

00:26:50.299 --> 00:26:50.309
said we also have to keep all the
 

00:26:50.309 --> 00:26:52.279
said we also have to keep all the
subclasses so we have to say keep class

00:26:52.279 --> 00:26:52.289
subclasses so we have to say keep class
 

00:26:52.289 --> 00:26:56.440
subclasses so we have to say keep class
star extends calm Android plot dot plot

00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:56.450
star extends calm Android plot dot plot
 

00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:59.720
star extends calm Android plot dot plot
this will keep all subclasses of plot

00:26:59.720 --> 00:26:59.730
this will keep all subclasses of plot
 

00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:02.869
this will keep all subclasses of plot
and the plot class itself but is this

00:27:02.869 --> 00:27:02.879
and the plot class itself but is this
 

00:27:02.879 --> 00:27:06.080
and the plot class itself but is this
actually what we want if you think again

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:06.090
actually what we want if you think again
 

00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:08.830
actually what we want if you think again
what get class does it at runtime

00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:08.840
what get class does it at runtime
 

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:11.979
what get class does it at runtime
returns the class of the current object

00:27:11.979 --> 00:27:11.989
returns the class of the current object
 

00:27:11.989 --> 00:27:15.440
returns the class of the current object
now you can only be the current class if

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:15.450
now you can only be the current class if
 

00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:18.320
now you can only be the current class if
you've actually been instantiated but if

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:18.330
you've actually been instantiated but if
 

00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:20.479
you've actually been instantiated but if
a class never gets created there is no

00:27:20.479 --> 00:27:20.489
a class never gets created there is no
 

00:27:20.489 --> 00:27:23.680
a class never gets created there is no
way of getting it via get class

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:23.690
way of getting it via get class
 

00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:25.879
way of getting it via get class
so our keep rules do not actually have

00:27:25.879 --> 00:27:25.889
so our keep rules do not actually have
 

00:27:25.889 --> 00:27:29.090
so our keep rules do not actually have
to keep extra classes all we want is we

00:27:29.090 --> 00:27:29.100
to keep extra classes all we want is we
 

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:30.680
to keep extra classes all we want is we
want to prevent them from being renamed

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:30.690
want to prevent them from being renamed
 

00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:33.440
want to prevent them from being renamed
and that's where modifiers come in so

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:33.450
and that's where modifiers come in so
 

00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:34.729
and that's where modifiers come in so
here's a modifier for you

00:27:34.729 --> 00:27:34.739
here's a modifier for you
 

00:27:34.739 --> 00:27:36.919
here's a modifier for you
well this now does it still says keep

00:27:36.919 --> 00:27:36.929
well this now does it still says keep
 

00:27:36.929 --> 00:27:40.009
well this now does it still says keep
but it says allow shrinking so tells our

00:27:40.009 --> 00:27:40.019
but it says allow shrinking so tells our
 

00:27:40.019 --> 00:27:43.190
but it says allow shrinking so tells our
rate if you see this plot class you

00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:43.200
rate if you see this plot class you
 

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:45.080
rate if you see this plot class you
allowed to remove it if nobody uses it

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:45.090
allowed to remove it if nobody uses it
 

00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:47.060
allowed to remove it if nobody uses it
but if you keep it

00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:47.070
but if you keep it
 

00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:49.340
but if you keep it
don't rename it and don't optimize it

00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:49.350
don't rename it and don't optimize it
 

00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:52.099
don't rename it and don't optimize it
and this will fix our problem because

00:27:52.099 --> 00:27:52.109
and this will fix our problem because
 

00:27:52.109 --> 00:27:53.930
and this will fix our problem because
now the plot class at runtime will

00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:53.940
now the plot class at runtime will
 

00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:56.180
now the plot class at runtime will
actually still be called plot S will be

00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:56.190
actually still be called plot S will be
 

00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:59.599
actually still be called plot S will be
all the subclasses so that was not too

00:27:59.599 --> 00:27:59.609
all the subclasses so that was not too
 

00:27:59.609 --> 00:28:01.220
all the subclasses so that was not too
bad right you look a bit at the code you

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:01.230
bad right you look a bit at the code you
 

00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:02.749
bad right you look a bit at the code you
come up with to keep rules and your

00:28:02.749 --> 00:28:02.759
come up with to keep rules and your
 

00:28:02.759 --> 00:28:08.749
come up with to keep rules and your
application will run or not so it's

00:28:08.749 --> 00:28:08.759
application will run or not so it's
 

00:28:08.759 --> 00:28:10.759
application will run or not so it's
still not working we have to do more

00:28:10.759 --> 00:28:10.769
still not working we have to do more
 

00:28:10.769 --> 00:28:13.489
still not working we have to do more
forensics work what do we do we go back

00:28:13.489 --> 00:28:13.499
forensics work what do we do we go back
 

00:28:13.499 --> 00:28:15.950
forensics work what do we do we go back
to the adb log and the message has

00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:15.960
to the adb log and the message has
 

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:18.639
to the adb log and the message has
changed we now see a different exception

00:28:18.639 --> 00:28:18.649
changed we now see a different exception
 

00:28:18.649 --> 00:28:21.139
changed we now see a different exception
again it's not really clear what this is

00:28:21.139 --> 00:28:21.149
again it's not really clear what this is
 

00:28:21.149 --> 00:28:22.669
again it's not really clear what this is
trying to tell me but I have an

exception I can look for
so this says error while parsing key

00:28:25.999 --> 00:28:26.009
so this says error while parsing key
 

00:28:26.009 --> 00:28:30.739
so this says error while parsing key
line paint or stroke width okay why does

line paint or stroke width okay why does
 

00:28:30.749 --> 00:28:31.430
line paint or stroke width okay why does
this happen

00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:31.440
this happen
 

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:33.859
this happen
how do we find out we look at the code

00:28:33.859 --> 00:28:33.869
how do we find out we look at the code
 

00:28:33.869 --> 00:28:36.499
how do we find out we look at the code
and here's the corresponding method and

00:28:36.499 --> 00:28:36.509
and here's the corresponding method and
 

00:28:36.509 --> 00:28:38.659

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:39.330
there for you
 

00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:41.779
there for you
so again you can see we take a class and

00:28:41.779 --> 00:28:41.789
so again you can see we take a class and
 

00:28:41.789 --> 00:28:45.560
so again you can see we take a class and
then we get all its methods and next we

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:45.570
then we get all its methods and next we
 

00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:47.899
then we get all its methods and next we
compare the name of this method against

00:28:47.899 --> 00:28:47.909
compare the name of this method against
 

00:28:47.909 --> 00:28:51.500
compare the name of this method against
some given name we're looking for

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:51.510
some given name we're looking for
 

00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:53.700
some given name we're looking for
so there's two things that can go wrong

00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:53.710
so there's two things that can go wrong
 

00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:55.980
so there's two things that can go wrong
here we are just getting a set of all

here we are just getting a set of all
 

00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:57.930
here we are just getting a set of all
methods so we might have removed too

00:28:57.930 --> 00:28:57.940
methods so we might have removed too
 

00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:00.180
methods so we might have removed too
many methods and again we're getting the

00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:00.190
many methods and again we're getting the
 

00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:02.009
many methods and again we're getting the
name of these methods so we might have

00:29:02.009 --> 00:29:02.019
name of these methods so we might have
 

00:29:02.019 --> 00:29:04.289
name of these methods so we might have
renamed them so these are the two error

00:29:04.289 --> 00:29:04.299
renamed them so these are the two error
 

00:29:04.299 --> 00:29:05.940
renamed them so these are the two error
conditions we now have to check what are

00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:05.950

in there and then it will call
 

00:29:56.049 --> 00:29:58.590
in there and then it will call
corresponding getters and setters on an

object it's trying to configure so we'll

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:01.690
object it's trying to configure so we'll
 

00:30:01.690 --> 00:30:03.539
object it's trying to configure so we'll
take a graph object and then it will

00:30:03.539 --> 00:30:03.549
take a graph object and then it will
 

00:30:03.549 --> 00:30:06.000
take a graph object and then it will
call the get stroke get line paint

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:06.010
call the get stroke get line paint
 

00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:07.860
call the get stroke get line paint
getter and then set the stroke width

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:07.870
getter and then set the stroke width
 

00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:11.039
getter and then set the stroke width

of configuring something at run time and
it's a really great feature but if r8

00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:15.100
it's a really great feature but if r8

and this is the corresponding key pool

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:32.130
and this is the corresponding key pool
 

00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:35.789
and this is the corresponding key pool
what do we need to do we don't want to

00:30:35.789 --> 00:30:35.799
what do we need to do we don't want to
 

00:30:35.799 --> 00:30:37.860
what do we need to do we don't want to
keep any extra classes because again

00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:37.870
keep any extra classes because again
 

00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:39.180
keep any extra classes because again
we'll be trying to do here is we're

00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:39.190
we'll be trying to do here is we're
 

00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:41.100
we'll be trying to do here is we're
trying to take an object at runtime that

00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:41.110
trying to take an object at runtime that
 

00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:42.930
trying to take an object at runtime that
already exists and then we try to

00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:42.940
already exists and then we try to
 

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:44.519
already exists and then we try to
configure it by calling getters and

00:30:44.519 --> 00:30:44.529
configure it by calling getters and
 

00:30:44.529 --> 00:30:47.940
configure it by calling getters and
setters so that's what we use keep class

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:47.950
setters so that's what we use keep class
 

00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:50.310
setters so that's what we use keep class
members that doesn't keep any extra

00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:50.320
members that doesn't keep any extra
 

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:52.590
members that doesn't keep any extra
classes but it tells our aid if you're

00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:52.600
classes but it tells our aid if you're
 

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:54.750
classes but it tells our aid if you're
already keeping a class in the command

00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:54.760
already keeping a class in the command
 

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:57.240
already keeping a class in the command
replot package also keep these members

00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:57.250
replot package also keep these members
 

00:30:57.250 --> 00:31:00.960
replot package also keep these members
and don't rename them and what members

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:00.970
and don't rename them and what members
 

00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:03.120
and don't rename them and what members
do we want to keep first of all we want

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:03.130
do we want to keep first of all we want
 

00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:04.019
do we want to keep first of all we want
to keep getter

00:31:04.019 --> 00:31:04.029
to keep getter
 

00:31:04.029 --> 00:31:06.389
to keep getter
and what to get us look like they return

00:31:06.389 --> 00:31:06.399
and what to get us look like they return
 

00:31:06.399 --> 00:31:08.909
and what to get us look like they return
some result that's the three stars they

00:31:08.909 --> 00:31:08.919
some result that's the three stars they
 

00:31:08.919 --> 00:31:10.680
some result that's the three stars they
start with get and they typically have

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:10.690
start with get and they typically have
 

00:31:10.690 --> 00:31:11.659
start with get and they typically have
no arguments

00:31:11.659 --> 00:31:11.669
no arguments
 

00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:14.070
no arguments
so that first line in there will keep

00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:14.080
so that first line in there will keep
 

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:16.409
so that first line in there will keep
your getters similarly we can keep

00:31:16.409 --> 00:31:16.419
your getters similarly we can keep
 

00:31:16.419 --> 00:31:18.719
your getters similarly we can keep
setters so they don't return anything

00:31:18.719 --> 00:31:18.729
setters so they don't return anything
 

00:31:18.729 --> 00:31:21.749
setters so they don't return anything
but they start with set and they take a

00:31:21.749 --> 00:31:21.759
but they start with set and they take a
 

00:31:21.759 --> 00:31:25.769
but they start with set and they take a
single argument of some type so this

00:31:25.769 --> 00:31:25.779
single argument of some type so this
 

00:31:25.779 --> 00:31:27.149
single argument of some type so this
rule will now keep the getters and

00:31:27.149 --> 00:31:27.159
rule will now keep the getters and
 

00:31:27.159 --> 00:31:29.190
rule will now keep the getters and
setters so that the run time the

00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:29.200
setters so that the run time the
 

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:34.649
setters so that the run time the
configuration can just happen so one

00:31:34.649 --> 00:31:34.659
configuration can just happen so one
 

00:31:34.659 --> 00:31:36.180
configuration can just happen so one
more keep rule do you think it will work

00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:36.190
more keep rule do you think it will work
 

00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:40.469
more keep rule do you think it will work
now let's take a look and yes we made it

00:31:40.469 --> 00:31:40.479
now let's take a look and yes we made it
 

00:31:40.479 --> 00:31:42.570
now let's take a look and yes we made it
so we added a couple of keep rules and

00:31:42.570 --> 00:31:42.580
so we added a couple of keep rules and
 

00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:44.009
so we added a couple of keep rules and
now our application is actually running

00:31:44.009 --> 00:31:44.019
now our application is actually running
 

00:31:44.019 --> 00:31:44.519
now our application is actually running
again

00:31:44.519 --> 00:31:44.529
again
 

00:31:44.529 --> 00:31:46.889
again
but was it worth it because this was a

00:31:46.889 --> 00:31:46.899
but was it worth it because this was a
 

00:31:46.899 --> 00:31:48.329
but was it worth it because this was a
bit of an investment right we had to

00:31:48.329 --> 00:31:48.339
bit of an investment right we had to
 

00:31:48.339 --> 00:31:49.529
bit of an investment right we had to
look at the code where to figure out

00:31:49.529 --> 00:31:49.539
look at the code where to figure out
 

00:31:49.539 --> 00:31:51.269
look at the code where to figure out
what it actually does what's this

00:31:51.269 --> 00:31:51.279
what it actually does what's this
 

00:31:51.279 --> 00:31:53.820
what it actually does what's this
journey worth while let's go back to the

00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:53.830
journey worth while let's go back to the
 

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:57.570
journey worth while let's go back to the
apk analyzer and here you can see the

00:31:57.570 --> 00:31:57.580
apk analyzer and here you can see the
 

00:31:57.580 --> 00:31:59.879
apk analyzer and here you can see the
results so if you look at comb Google

00:31:59.879 --> 00:31:59.889
results so if you look at comb Google
 

00:31:59.889 --> 00:32:02.639
results so if you look at comb Google
which is guava that went from 1.3

00:32:02.639 --> 00:32:02.649
which is guava that went from 1.3

megabytes to just 8k I know that's very

00:32:07.079 --> 00:32:07.089
megabytes to just 8k I know that's very
 

00:32:07.089 --> 00:32:09.180

which is made more realistic you can see

00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:14.950
which is made more realistic you can see
 

00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:17.279
which is made more realistic you can see
that it went from 180 K to about a

00:32:17.279 --> 00:32:17.289
that it went from 180 K to about a
 

00:32:17.289 --> 00:32:19.379
that it went from 180 K to about a
hundred K and that's more than one

00:32:19.379 --> 00:32:19.389
hundred K and that's more than one
 

00:32:19.389 --> 00:32:22.979

00:32:24.999 --> 00:32:28.709
my app you can see that it went from 35
K to 2k and 2k is a lot closer to the

00:32:28.709 --> 00:32:28.719
K to 2k and 2k is a lot closer to the
 

00:32:28.719 --> 00:32:30.469
K to 2k and 2k is a lot closer to the
hundred lines of code I actually wrote

created this graphic for you to make
 

00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:43.499
created this graphic for you to make
this a bit more visual and as you can

00:32:43.499 --> 00:32:43.509
this a bit more visual and as you can

see guava nearly disappeared and her

00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:46.570
see guava nearly disappeared and her
 

00:32:46.570 --> 00:32:49.320
see guava nearly disappeared and her
plot haft and my app also turned into

00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:49.330
plot haft and my app also turned into
 

00:32:49.330 --> 00:32:52.919

this little sliver there so it was a bit

00:32:52.919 --> 00:32:52.929
this little sliver there so it was a bit
 

00:32:52.929 --> 00:32:55.139
this little sliver there so it was a bit
of a journey but it really really paid

00:32:55.139 --> 00:32:55.149
of a journey but it really really paid
 

00:32:55.149 --> 00:32:59.879
of a journey but it really really paid
off so what's the takeaway lessons here

00:32:59.879 --> 00:32:59.889
off so what's the takeaway lessons here
 

00:32:59.889 --> 00:33:02.700
off so what's the takeaway lessons here
I hope I was able to convince you that

00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:02.710
I hope I was able to convince you that
 

00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:04.440
I hope I was able to convince you that
it actually makes sense to look into

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:04.450
it actually makes sense to look into
 

00:33:04.450 --> 00:33:07.139
it actually makes sense to look into
size but if you build an app no matter

00:33:07.139 --> 00:33:07.149
size but if you build an app no matter
 

00:33:07.149 --> 00:33:08.969
size but if you build an app no matter
what your target audience is please

00:33:08.969 --> 00:33:08.979
what your target audience is please

creating keep rules

00:33:11.849 --> 00:33:11.859

but also I hope I've shown you some

00:33:18.570 --> 00:33:18.580
but also I hope I've shown you some
 

00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:22.260
but also I hope I've shown you some
ideas of how to make this easier and the

00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:22.270
ideas of how to make this easier and the
 

00:33:22.270 --> 00:33:24.000
ideas of how to make this easier and the
first thing to really take away here is

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:24.010
first thing to really take away here is
 

00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:27.020
first thing to really take away here is
you should consider size early on

00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:27.030
you should consider size early on
 

00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:30.030
you should consider size early on
because while you're writing your code

00:33:30.030 --> 00:33:30.040
because while you're writing your code
 

00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:32.460
because while you're writing your code
that is really really easy to also write

00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:32.470
that is really really easy to also write
 

00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:34.170
that is really really easy to also write
your keep rules because you still

00:33:34.170 --> 00:33:34.180
your keep rules because you still
 

00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:35.790
your keep rules because you still
understand what that code is actually

00:33:35.790 --> 00:33:35.800
understand what that code is actually
 

00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:38.550
understand what that code is actually
doing write all the code examples we

00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:38.560
doing write all the code examples we
 

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:40.440
doing write all the code examples we
looked at if you had just written them

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:40.450
looked at if you had just written them
 

00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:42.150
looked at if you had just written them
it would be easy to understand why this

00:33:42.150 --> 00:33:42.160
it would be easy to understand why this
 

00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:44.300
it would be easy to understand why this
goes wrong

00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:44.310
goes wrong
 

00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:46.440
goes wrong
also you should add structure to your

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:46.450
also you should add structure to your
 

00:33:46.450 --> 00:33:49.430
also you should add structure to your
code to each describing reflective use

00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:49.440
code to each describing reflective use
 

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:51.450
code to each describing reflective use
you remember this getters and setters

00:33:51.450 --> 00:33:51.460
you remember this getters and setters
 

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:53.700
you remember this getters and setters
example I had where I said okay all

00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:53.710
example I had where I said okay all
 

00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:55.590
example I had where I said okay all
classes and Android plot keep the

00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:55.600
classes and Android plot keep the
 

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:57.990
classes and Android plot keep the
getters and setters these kind of things

00:33:57.990 --> 00:33:58.000
getters and setters these kind of things
 

00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.610
getters and setters these kind of things
are much simpler if you actually have

00:33:59.610 --> 00:33:59.620
are much simpler if you actually have
 

00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:01.530
are much simpler if you actually have
some kind of interface that allows you

00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:01.540
some kind of interface that allows you
 

00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:03.720
some kind of interface that allows you
to tighten these up so if you had an

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:03.730
to tighten these up so if you had an
 

00:34:03.730 --> 00:34:06.810
to tighten these up so if you had an
interface say runtime configured you

00:34:06.810 --> 00:34:06.820
interface say runtime configured you
 

00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:09.120
interface say runtime configured you
could just say in a keep rule every

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:09.130
could just say in a keep rule every
 

00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:11.310
could just say in a keep rule every
object that extends runtime configured

00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:11.320
object that extends runtime configured
 

00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:14.909
object that extends runtime configured
keep these getters and setters and then

00:34:14.909 --> 00:34:14.919
keep these getters and setters and then
 

00:34:14.919 --> 00:34:15.930
keep these getters and setters and then
it's independent of the actual

00:34:15.930 --> 00:34:15.940
it's independent of the actual
 

00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:17.909
it's independent of the actual
application then it can just be part of

00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:17.919
application then it can just be part of
 

00:34:17.919 --> 00:34:21.090
application then it can just be part of
the library and lastly and this sounds

00:34:21.090 --> 00:34:21.100
the library and lastly and this sounds
 

00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:22.800
the library and lastly and this sounds
obvious but it's really important you

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:22.810
obvious but it's really important you
 

00:34:22.810 --> 00:34:24.870
obvious but it's really important you
should continuously test an optimized

00:34:24.870 --> 00:34:24.880
should continuously test an optimized
 

00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:28.020
should continuously test an optimized
built again the earlier you find

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:28.030
built again the earlier you find
 

00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:30.630
built again the earlier you find
regressions in your build the easier is

00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:30.640
regressions in your build the easier is
 

00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:32.250
regressions in your build the easier is
to fix them because you will still

00:34:32.250 --> 00:34:32.260
to fix them because you will still
 

00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:33.990
to fix them because you will still
remember what you actually changed and

00:34:33.990 --> 00:34:34.000
remember what you actually changed and
 

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.850
remember what you actually changed and
it will make it easy to come up with

00:34:35.850 --> 00:34:35.860
it will make it easy to come up with
 

00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:41.669
it will make it easy to come up with
keep rules if you are library developer

00:34:41.669 --> 00:34:41.679
keep rules if you are library developer
 

00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:44.070
keep rules if you are library developer
you should really really carefully

00:34:44.070 --> 00:34:44.080
you should really really carefully
 

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:47.250
you should really really carefully
provide keep rules because there's this

00:34:47.250 --> 00:34:47.260
provide keep rules because there's this
 

00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:49.860
provide keep rules because there's this
multiplier if you make precise keep

00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:49.870
multiplier if you make precise keep
 

00:34:49.870 --> 00:34:52.110
multiplier if you make precise keep
rules all the users of the of your

00:34:52.110 --> 00:34:52.120
rules all the users of the of your
 

00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:54.930
rules all the users of the of your
library will benefit from it and a lot

00:34:54.930 --> 00:34:54.940
library will benefit from it and a lot
 

00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:58.200
library will benefit from it and a lot
of apps will become smaller don't make

00:34:58.200 --> 00:34:58.210
of apps will become smaller don't make
 

00:34:58.210 --> 00:35:00.000
of apps will become smaller don't make
this an afterthought invest in to keep

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:00.010
this an afterthought invest in to keep
 

00:35:00.010 --> 00:35:02.040
this an afterthought invest in to keep
rules while you build your library while

00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:02.050
rules while you build your library while
 

00:35:02.050 --> 00:35:04.470
rules while you build your library while
you design your library publish them

00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:04.480
you design your library publish them
 

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:05.700
you design your library publish them
somewhere where people can find them

00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:05.710
somewhere where people can find them
 

00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:07.590
somewhere where people can find them
because that's typically what we all do

00:35:07.590 --> 00:35:07.600
because that's typically what we all do
 

00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:10.110
because that's typically what we all do
we will search the internet for rules to

00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:10.120
we will search the internet for rules to
 

00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:12.660
we will search the internet for rules to
use so put them on your home page put

00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:12.670
use so put them on your home page put
 

00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:14.400
use so put them on your home page put
them in the readme file make it visible

00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:14.410
them in the readme file make it visible
 

00:35:14.410 --> 00:35:18.480
them in the readme file make it visible
and lastly consider using consumer

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:18.490
and lastly consider using consumer
 

00:35:18.490 --> 00:35:20.610
and lastly consider using consumer
ProGuard files when you're shipping via

00:35:20.610 --> 00:35:20.620
ProGuard files when you're shipping via
 

00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:23.250
ProGuard files when you're shipping via
the IAR system because this makes it

00:35:23.250 --> 00:35:23.260
the IAR system because this makes it
 

00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:25.290
the IAR system because this makes it
completely transparent to your library

00:35:25.290 --> 00:35:25.300
completely transparent to your library
 

00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:27.480
completely transparent to your library
users when they enable ProGuard they

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:27.490
users when they enable ProGuard they
 

00:35:27.490 --> 00:35:32.720
users when they enable ProGuard they
will automatically get your keep rules
