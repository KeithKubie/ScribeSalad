00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:06.670
Let's say I had the set of
vectors-- I don't want to do

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.039
it that thick.

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:14.350
Let's say one of the vectors is
the vector 2, 3, and then

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:20.910
the other vector is
the vector 4, 6.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.050
And I just want to answer the
question: what is the span of

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.685
these vectors?

00:00:24.685 --> 00:00:26.800
And let's assume that these
are position vectors.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.330
What are all of the
vectors that these

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.150
two vectors can represent?

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.000
Well, if you just look at it,
and remember, the span is just

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.150
all of the vectors that can
be represented by linear

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.320
combinations of these.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.470
So it's the set of all the
vectors that if I have some

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.350
constant times 2 times that
vector plus some other

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.490
constant times this vector,
it's all the possibilities

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.970
that I can represent when I just
put a bunch of different

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.640
real numbers for c1 and c2.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.640
Now, the first thing you might
realize is that, look, this

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.250
vector 2, this is just
the same thing as

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.880
2 times this vector.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.000
So I could just rewrite
it like this.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.330
I could just rewrite it as c1
times the vector 2, 3 plus c2

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.820
times the vector-- and here,
instead of writing the vector

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.720
4, 6, I'm going to write 2 times
the vector 2, 3, because

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.310
this vector is just a multiple
of that vector.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.330
So I could write c2 times
2 times 2, 3.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.470
I think you see that this is
equivalent to the 4, 6.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:33.440
2 times 2 is 4.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.100
2 times 3 is 6.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.850
Well, then we can simplify
this a little bit.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:45.320
We can rewrite this as just c1
plus 2c2, all of that, times

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.610
2, 3, times our vector 2, 3.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.530
And this is just some
arbitrary constant.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.290
It's some arbitrary constant
plus 2 times some other

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.740
arbitrary constant.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.550
So we can just call this c3
times my vector 2, 3.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.110
So in this situation, even
though we started with two

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.040
vectors, and I said, well, you
know, the span of these two

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.419
vectors is equal to all of
the vectors that can be

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:12.260
constructed with some linear
combination of these, any

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.180
linear combination of these,
if I just use this

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.890
substitution right here, can
be reduced to just a scalar

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.860
multiple of my first vector.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.420
And I could have gone the
other way around.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.840
I could have substituted this
vector as being 1/2 times

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.460
this, and just made any
combination of scalar multiple

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.290
of the second vector.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.910
But the fact is, that instead
of talking about linear

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.150
combinations of two vectors,
I can reduce this to just a

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.840
scalar combination
of one vector.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.130
And we've seen in R2 a scalar
combination of one vector,

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.990
especially if they're
position vectors.

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.780
For example, this vector 2, 3.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:43.850
It's 2, 3.

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.440
It looks like this.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.060
All the scalar combinations of
that vector are just going to

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.970
lie along this line.

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.740
So 2, 3, it's going
to be right there.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.280
They're all just going to lie
along that line right there,

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.480
so along this line going in
both directions forever.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.000
And if I take negative
values of 2, 3, I'm

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.260
going to go down here.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.695
If I take positive values,
I'm going to go here.

00:03:06.695 --> 00:03:08.100
If I get really large positive
values, it's

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.480
going to go up here.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.640
But I can just represent the
vectors, and when you put them

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.190
in standard form, their arrows
essentially would

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.180
trace out this line.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.430
So you could say that the span
of my set of vectors-- let me

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:22.680
put it over here.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:39.510
The span of the set of vectors
2, 3 and 4, 6 is

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:40.960
just this line here.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.930
Even though we have
two vectors,

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.990
they're essentially collinear.

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:46.160
They're multiples
of each other.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.970
I mean, if this is 2, 3, 4,
6 is just this right here.

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.530
It's just that longer
one right there.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.090
They're collinear.

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.340
These two things
are collinear.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.500
Now, in this case, when we have
two collinear vectors in

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:09.380
R2, essentially their span just
reduces to that line.

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.220
You can't represent
some vector like--

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.720
let me do a new color.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.260
You can't represent this vector
right there with some

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.890
combination of those
two vectors.

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.540
There's no way to kind of
break out of this line.

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.890
So there's no way that you can
represent everything in R2.

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.330
So the span is just
that line there.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.310
Now, a related idea to this,
and notice, you had two

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.650
vectors, but it kind of reduced
to one vector when you

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.670
took its linear combinations.

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.460
The related idea here is that we
call this set-- we call it

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.650
linearly dependent.

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:46.330
Let me write that down:
linearly dependent.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:52.000
This is a linearly
dependent set.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.350
And linearly dependent just
means that one of the vectors

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.040
in the set can be represented
by some combination of the

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.850
other vectors in the set.

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.980
A way to think about it is
whichever vector you pick that

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.450
can be represented by the
others, it's not adding any

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.520
new directionality or any
new information, right?

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.160
In this case, we already had
a vector that went in this

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.270
direction, and when you throw
this 4, 6 on there, you're

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.030
going in the same direction,
just scaled up.

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.740
So it's not giving us any new
dimension, letting us break

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.050
out of this line, right?

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.990
And you can imagine in three
space, if you have one vector

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.790
that looks like this and another
vector that looks like

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.110
this, two vectors that aren't
collinear, they're going to

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.410
define a kind of two-dimensional
space.

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.380
They can define a
two-dimensional space.

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:35.840
Let's say that this is
the plane defined

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.450
by those two vectors.

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:42.270
In order to define R3, a third
vector in that set can't be

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.140
coplanar with those
two, right?

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:48.070
If this third vector is coplanar
with these, it's not

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.050
adding any more directionality.

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.980
So this set of three
vectors will

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:53.690
also be linearly dependent.

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:56.620
And another way to think about
it is that these two purple

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:02.230
vectors span this plane, span
the plane that they define,

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:03.610
essentially, right?

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:07.500
Anything in this plane going in
any direction can be-- any

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.410
vector in this plane, when we
say span it, that means that

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:13.620
any vector can be represented
by a linear combination of

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.810
this vector and this vector,
which means that if this

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.960
vector is on that plane, it can
be represented as a linear

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.390
combination of that vector
and that vector.

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:26.720
So this green vector I added
isn't going to add anything to

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:32.680
the span of our set of vectors
and that's because this is a

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.160
linearly dependent set.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.880
This one can be represented by a
sum of that one and that one

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:41.620
because this one and this
one span this plane.

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:45.190
In order for the span of these
three vectors to kind of get

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:50.170
more dimensionality or start
representing R3, the third

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:53.090
vector will have to break
out of that plane.

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:56.590
It would have to break
out of that plane.

00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:00.020
And if a vector is breaking out
of that plane, that means

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.370
it's a vector that can't be
represented anywhere on that

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:05.310
plane, so it's outside of the
span of those two vectors.

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:07.400
Where it's outside, it can't
be represented by a linear

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.360
combination of this
one and this one.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:13.190
So if you had a vector of this
one, this one, and this one,

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:15.250
and just those three, none of
these other things that I

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:18.980
drew, that would be linearly
independent.

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:22.950
Let me draw a couple more
examples for you.

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:25.430
That one might have been
a little too abstract.

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:36.110
So, for example, if I have the
vectors 2, 3 and I have the

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:46.330
vector 7, 2, and I have the
vector 9, 5, and I were to ask

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:50.010
you, are these linearly
dependent or independent?

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:52.470
So at first you say, well, you
know, it's not trivial.

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:55.020
Let's see, this isn't a scalar
multiple of that.

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:57.060
That doesn't look like a scalar
multiple of either of

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:57.800
the other two.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:00.320
Maybe they're linearly
independent.

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.610
But then, if you kind of inspect
them, you kind of see

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:07.600
that v, if we call this v1,
vector 1, plus vector 2, if we

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.810
call this vector 2, is
equal to vector 3.

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:13.910
So vector 3 is a linear
combination of

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:15.250
these other two vectors.

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:25.180
So this is a linearly
dependent set.

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:30.770
And if we were to show it, draw
it in kind of two space,

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:34.010
and it's just a general idea
that-- well, let me see.

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:35.330
Let me draw it in R2.

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:38.409
There's a general idea that if
you have three two-dimensional

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:41.350
vectors, one of them is
going to be redundant.

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:44.070
Well, one of them definitely
will be redundant.

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:49.030
For example, if we do 2, 3, if
we do the vector 2, 3, that's

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:50.872
the first one right there.

00:08:50.872 --> 00:08:53.730
I draw it in the standard
position.

00:08:53.730 --> 00:09:06.010
And I draw the vector 7, 2 right
there, I could show you

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:13.090
that any point in R2 can be
represented by some linear

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:14.450
combination of these
two vectors.

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:17.570
We can even do a kind of a
graphical representation.

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:20.750
I've done that in the previous
video, so I could write that

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:30.630
the span of v1 and v2
is equal to R2.

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:35.100
That means that every vector,
every position here can be

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:39.530
represented by some linear
combination of these two guys.

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:49.830
Now, the vector 9,
5, it is in R2.

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:51.730
It is in R2, right?

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:52.060
Clearly.

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:53.490
I just graphed it
on this plane.

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:56.870
It's in our two-dimensional,
real number space.

00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:02.100
Or I guess we could call it
a space or in our set R2.

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:03.280
It's there.

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:04.720
It's right there.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:07.930
So we just said that anything in
R2 can be represented by a

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:09.760
linear combination of
those two guys.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.720
So clearly, this is in R2, so
it can be represented as a

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.850
linear combination.

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:15.940
So hopefully, you're starting
to see the relationship

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:20.810
between span and linear
independence or linear

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:21.370
dependence.

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:24.100
Let me do another example.

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:30.263
Let's say I have the vectors--
let me do a new color.

00:10:30.263 --> 00:10:32.620
Let's say I have the vector--
and this one will be a little

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:38.140
bit obvious-- 7, 0, so that's
my v1, and then I have my

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:42.060
second vector, which
is 0, minus 1.

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:43.850
That's v2.

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:49.170
Now, is this set linearly
independent?

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:50.840
Is it linearly independent?

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:53.370
Well, can I represent
either of these as a

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:54.400
combination of the other?

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.020
And really when I say as a
combination, you'd have to

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:58.270
scale up one to get the other,
because there's only two

00:10:58.270 --> 00:10:59.820
vectors here.

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:02.310
If I am trying to add up to this
vector, the only thing I

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:03.730
have to deal with is this
one, so all I can

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:05.030
do is scale it up.

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:06.850
Well, there's nothing
I can do.

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:10.190
No matter what I multiply this
vector by, you know, some

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:14.520
constant and add it to itself
or scale it up, this term

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:16.400
right here is always
going to be zero.

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.560
It's always going to be zero.

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:20.300
So nothing I can multiply
this by is going to

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:21.970
get me to this vector.

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:25.820
Likewise, no matter what I
multiply this vector by, the

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:27.590
top term is always
going to be zero.

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:29.920
So there's no way I could
get to this vector.

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.020
So both of these vectors,
there's no way that you can

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:34.720
represent one as a combination
of the other.

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.970
So these two are linearly
independent.

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:41.220
And you can even see
it if we graph it.

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:44.245
One is 7, 0, which
is like that.

00:11:44.245 --> 00:11:46.195
Let me do it in a non-yellow
color.

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:50.140
7, 0.

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:54.250
And one is 0, minus 1.

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:57.030
And I think you can clearly see
that if you take a linear

00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:59.780
combination of any of these
two, you can represent

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:00.780
anything in R2.

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:04.320
So the span of these, just to
kind of get used to our notion

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:09.550
of span of v1 and v2,
is equal to R2.

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:12.790
Now, this is another interesting
point to make.

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:15.640
I said the span of
v1 and v2 is R2.

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:22.850
Now what is the span of
v1, v2, and v3 in

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:24.810
this example up here?

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:25.550
I already told you.

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:28.170
I already showed you that
this third vector can be

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:30.030
represented as a linear
combination of these two.

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:32.050
It's actually just these
two summed up.

00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:33.210
I can even draw it right here.

00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:34.620
It's just those two
vectors summed up.

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:37.280
So it clearly can be represented
as a linear

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:38.860
combination of those two.

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:40.670
So what's its span?

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:43.270
Well, the fact that this is
redundant means that it

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:44.200
doesn't change its span.

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:47.000
It doesn't change all of the
possible linear combinations.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.500
So its span is also
going to be R2.

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:52.540
It's just that this was
more vectors than you

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:54.210
needed to span R2.

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:57.210
R2 is a two-dimensional space,
and you needed two vectors.

00:12:57.210 --> 00:13:02.180
So this was kind of a more
efficient way of providing a

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:06.830
basis, and I haven't defined
basis formally, yet, but I

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:09.720
just want to use it a little
conversationally, and then

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.780
it'll make sense to you when
I define it formally.

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:15.060
This provides a better basis, or
this provides a basis, kind

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:19.460
of a non-redundant set of
vectors that can represent R2.

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:22.910
While this one, right
here, is redundant.

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:27.620
So it's not a good
basis for R2.

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:30.060
Let me give you one more example
in three dimensions.

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.940
And then in the next video,
I'm going to make a more

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:36.400
formal definition of linear
dependence or independence.

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:42.205
So let's say that I had
the vector 2, 0, 0.

00:13:42.205 --> 00:13:45.470
Let me make a similar argument
that I made up there: the

00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:53.330
vector 2, 0, 0, the vector 0, 1,
0, and the vector 0, 0, 7.

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.050
We are now in R3, right?

00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:00.550
Each of these are
three-dimensional vectors.

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:03.290
Now, are these linear dependent
or linearly

00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:04.010
independent?

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:07.080
Sorry, are they linearly
dependent or independent?

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:10.960
Well, there's no way with some
combination of these two

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:14.880
vectors that I can end up with
a non-zero term right here to

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:16.160
make this third vector, right?

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:18.160
Because no matter what I
multiply this one by and this

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.400
one by, this last term
is going to be zero.

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.690
So this is kind of adding
a new direction

00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:24.640
to our set of vectors.

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:26.810
Likewise, there's nothing
I can do-- there's no

00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:30.720
combination of this guy and
this guy that I can get a

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.430
non-zero term here.

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:34.930
And finally, no combination of
this guy and this guy that I

00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:36.680
can get a non-zero term here.

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:39.035
So this set is linearly
independent.

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:46.550
And if you were to graph these
in three dimensions, you would

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:50.610
see that none of these--
these three do not

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:51.690
lie on the same plane.

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:54.580
Obviously, any two of them lie
on the same plane, but if you

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:56.730
were to actually graph
it, you get 2, 0.

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:58.350
Let me say that that's x-axis.

00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:00.690
That's 2, 0, 0.

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:02.510
Then you have this, 0, 1, 0.

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:03.700
Maybe that's the y-axis.

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:05.370
And then you have 0, 0, 7.

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:07.070
It would look something
like this.

00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:09.300
So it almost looks like, your
three-dimensional axes, it

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:10.860
almost looks like the
vectors i, j, k.

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:12.390
They're just scaled
up a little bit.

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:15.410
But you can always correct
that by just scaling them

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:16.160
down, right?

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:19.240
Because we care about any linear
combination of these.

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:25.090
So the span of these three
vectors right here, because

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:28.580
they're all adding new
directionality, is R3.

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:33.690
Anyway, I thought I would leave
you there in this video.

00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:35.950
I realize I've been making
longer and longer videos, and

00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:38.230
I want to get back in the habit
of making shorter ones.

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:40.270
In the next video, I'm going
to make a more formal

00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:43.450
definition of linear dependence,
and we'll do a

00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:45.200
bunch more examples.
