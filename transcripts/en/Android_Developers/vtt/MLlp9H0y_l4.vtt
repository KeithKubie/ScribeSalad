&gt;&gt; JASON: Hi my name is Jason and I work on
the Android project. I work on the Framework

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:09.530
and WiFi. One of my favorite features about
Android is the ability to quickly switch between

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:15.709
programs while I'm on the go. So, if I'm in
the browser, I can quickly switch between

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:23.760
applications. Letâ€™s say I want to go to
maps. I do Search M, and IM Search I. And

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.210
there you go.
