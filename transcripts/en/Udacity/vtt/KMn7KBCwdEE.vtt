00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.645
Let's lay back to what we did before. And what our goal is, eventually, we want

00:00:03.645 --> 00:00:07.223
to get x bytes off. We want to isolate it on one side of the equation, so that

00:00:07.223 --> 00:00:10.940
means that something is going to have to happen with all this constant stuff

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.903
over here. Something is also going to have to happen with our coefficient of a.

00:00:14.903 --> 00:00:18.616
So actually, let's do with both of those things now. What does that will leave

00:00:18.616 --> 00:00:22.156
us with on the left side of the equation and what does that put on the right

00:00:22.156 --> 00:00:22.503
side?
