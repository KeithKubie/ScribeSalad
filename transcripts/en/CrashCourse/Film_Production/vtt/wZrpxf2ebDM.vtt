00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:07.259
As you probably noticed I'm not Craig. My name is Lily Gladstone and for the next 15 weeks,

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.169
I'll be leading you through Crash Course Film Production. First a little about me. I'm an actor and I love movies.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.379
I love making them, watching them, thinking about them, in fact

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.379
I've spent most of my adult life acting in or educating people about movies and all of that has brought me here, to Crash Course

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:26.939
Filmmakers do great things and some not great things with cameras, lights microphones,

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.899
actors, makeup, costumes and special effects. They put together all these puzzle pieces to perform an amazing trick and communicate ideas

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.210
and emotions on a two-dimensional screen.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:42.270
They make us laugh, cry, squeal, cover our eye and every movie starts very simply: starts with an idea.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.520
Maybe it's a grand vision of an intergalactic war or a small and tender tale about a woman trekking across

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:54.180
country with her dog. Either way both these ideas go through many transformations before they arrive in a movie theater on Netflix or on Blu-Ray.

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.059
But how?

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:00.059
How do you take an idea and turn it into something that you can show people and how do you get people interested in helping

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.419
you make it? How do you cast it, crew it, edit it, for it and release it?

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.820
Are you going to direct it and what does the director

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.500
actually do? What are producers anyway? Do you even need one? Actually let's get this one out of the way right now.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.890
Yes!

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:11.250
Yes!

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.250
Producers are very necessary and like

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.610
how much does this all gonna cost? Do you need two hundred million dollars to bring your idea to life

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.590
or do you need two thousand? With this series

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.840
we hope to demystify a lot of these questions

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.520
and help everyone understand just how much goes into making a movie. Because working on films is fun and exciting!!!

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:32.669
But it's also a lot of very focused work that can turn into chaos if you're not prepared or paying attention. So join me,

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.970
Lily Gladstone, for the next 15 episodes of Crash Course Film Production produced in association with our friends at PBS digital studios.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:49.000
