00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.500
Molecules! So many of them in their infinite
and beautiful variety,

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.109
but while that variety is great, it can also
be pretty dang overwhelming.

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:14.989
And so, in order to help this complicated chemical world make a little more sense, we classify and we categorize.

00:00:14.989 --> 00:00:17.520
It's our nature as humans, and it's extremely
useful.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.990
One of the most important of those classifications
is whether a molecule is polar or non-polar.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.250
It's a kind of symmetry, not just of the molecule,
but of the charge.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.710
It's pretty easy to see when you're just lookin'
at 'em.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:33.260
You got polar and non-polar, polar, non-polar,
polar, non-polar.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.670
I'm gonna take sides right now.
I'm on team polar.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.510
I think polar molecules are way more interesting,
despite their wonky, off-balance selves.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.190
Non-polar molecules are useful, and their
symmetry has a kind of beauty,

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.990
but polar, in my humble opinion, is where
it's at.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:55.160
[Theme Music]

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.479
All right. Now here are two very different
types of chemicals.

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:03.199
Right here I have a stick of butter, and then
in this bowl, that's just normal water.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.660
So I'm just gonna go ahead and squeeze this butter, which if you're wondering is both a terrible and wonderful feeling.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.140
And then I'm going to [laughs] just drop that.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.620
Now I'm going to attempt to wash that butter
off my hand.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.200
But that is just not hap...
that's just, it's not going anywhere, ever.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.900
Ever.
It's just beading up on me.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.740
Why? Because water is a polar molecule, and the various chemicals that make up butter are non-polar,

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.440
and water wants nothing to do with that.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.450
So. What makes a molecule polar?
Well, two things.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.710
First, asymmetrical electron distribution
around the molecule.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.030
You can't have a polar molecule made up entirely
of the same element

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.970
because those atoms will all have the same
electronegativity,

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.650
and thus the electron distribution will be
completely symmetrical.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.910
Electronegativity is usually thought of as how much an element wants electrons around it,

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.810
but I think it's more about how much electrons
want to be near that element.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.060
If electrons were 13-year-old girls, fluorine
would be Niall Horan.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.670
They'll do anything just to be near it.
Why? Some simple periodic trends.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.940
Electronegativity increases from left to right
because there are more protons in the atoms,

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.990
and more protons means more boys in the band.

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.050
Meanwhile, it decreases as you move from top
to bottom

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.180
because as the crowd of electrons gets bigger, they start to shield each other from the effects of the protons.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.720
What I'm trying to say is that electrons are
hipsters.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.130
If a bunch of other electrons are into that
thing, they're less interested.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.850
Now there are a number of other factors here,

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.040
but just like the relationship between tweens
and their latest boy band fixation,

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.050
it's complicated and weird and you probably
don't want to think too much about it.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.380
But in this nice little map, you can see that
the trend is pretty clear.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.740
The upper-right is where all the superstars
of electro-fame are.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.240
Oxygen, nitrogen, fluorine, chlorine, and bromine are basically the One Direction of the periodic table.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.720
So for polarity to occur in a molecule, you
have to have two different elements at a minimum,

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.700
and the difference between their electronegativities
has to be 0.5 or greater.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.460
If that's the case, the outer electrons spend enough extra time around the element that's more electronegative

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.860
that chemists label the molecule polar.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.400
The result is a partially negative charge
on the more electronegative part of the molecule

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.540
and a partially positive charge on the less
electronegative side.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.599
Now in extreme cases, like if the electronegativity
is greater than 1.6,

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:16.020
then we end up with two ions in the same molecule.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.160
This isn't what we're talking about here when
we talk about polar molecules.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.410
We're talking about differences between 0.5
and 1.6.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.130
Another requirement for polarity: you gotta
have geometrical asymmetry.

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.430
CO2 here has the charge asymmetry locked up,
but because the molecule is linear, in a straight

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.209
line, it's a kind of symmetrical asymmetry.

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:39.209
The same thing does for CH4 with its tetrahedron
of weakly electronegative hydrogens around

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.180
a more strongly electronegative carbon.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.380
These molecules have polar bonds, but the
molecules themselves are not polar

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.319
because the symmetry of the bonds cancels
out the asymmetry of the charges.

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:53.550
In order for a molecule to be polar, there
has to be a dipole moment,

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.480
a separation of the charge around the molecule into a more positive area and a more negative area.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.560
Lots of molecules are asymmetrical in both
electronegativity and geometry.

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:06.760
Those are our polar molecules, the asymmetrical
beauties of chemistry.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.140
Look at 'em all! They're so quirky and weird!

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.879
We've also got a system for indicating where
their charges are.

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:17.940
We draw an arrow with a plus sign at the tail
pointing toward the negative side of the molecule.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.500
A little lowercase delta plus (δ+) or delta
minus (δ–) by the individual atoms signify

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.120
a partial positive pr partial negative charge.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.530
Liquids made up of polar molecules are really
good at

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.710
dissolving solids that are composed of polar
or ionic compounds.

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.340
Ionic solids are basically just polarity taken
to the extreme,

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.060
so far that instead of having a partial positive
and partial negative dipole moment,

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.389
the electrons have completely transferred,
creating two charged ions.

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:44.180
Now I assume we've all heard that like dissolves
like,

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.620
so the easiest way to figure out if a liquid is polar or non-polar is just to dump it in some water.

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.960
But the why of this phenomenon is usually
just totally glossed over.

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.590
What's actually happening to those molecules?

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.870
It seems like they're all just bigots, terrified
of anything a little bit different than themselves.

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.720
But this is chemistry, so there must be some
fundamental reason.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.940
And if it's fundamental, it probably has something
to do with decreasing the energy of the system.

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.100
And indeed it does.

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.000
Those partial positive and partial negative
charges of water?

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.920
They're at their lowest energy state when
they're lining up together, positive to negative,

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.960
into a kind of liquid crystal.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.120
There's an arrangement there.
It flows, of course,

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.840
but the oxygen sides are always doing their
best to orient themselves toward the hydrogen

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.030
sides of other molecules.

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.550
You can even see the effects of that attraction

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:37.640
as the surface tension that allows me to pour more than 100 milliliters of water into a 100 mil container.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:43.920
The strength of that surface tension depends on the intermolecular forces that pull molecules of a liquid together.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.760
These attractive, also called cohesive, forces
pull the surface molecules inward.

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.860
And what you see when you look at this pile
of water is the result of those cohesive forces,

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.460
minimized surface area in the water in this
beaker.

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:00.229
When you pit a bit of oil into that mix, the
water totally freaks out.

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:03.660
Oils have notoriously non-polar molecules,
so suddenly

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:09.560
there's this mass of uncharged gunk interfering with the nice, orderly arrangement of polar water molecules.

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:14.840
But if you take a closer look, the processes are very similar to those between water and air.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:20.760
Water does everything it can to minimize its
surface area and kind of expels the oil droplets.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:26.940
Rather than the water disliking the oil, it actually just likes itself much more, so it won't mix with the oil.

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:29.770
Now if you put polar stuff in, water is all
about that,

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:34.229
and those polar water molecules just go after
whatever other partial charges they can find.

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:36.630
Or, in the case of many ionic solids,

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:41.139
the partial negative charges on the oxygen
side all gang up on the positive ions,

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:44.910
while the partial positives on the hydrogen
side surround the negative ions,

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:49.080
breaking the crystals apart and dissolving
them into freely moving ions.

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.070
In some cases we can actually witness these
interactions in unexpected ways.

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:59.960
Mix 50 milliliters of water with 50 mils of alcohol and what the heck? There's less than 100 mils of liquid!

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:05.200
The arrangement of water mixed with alcohol is actually more structured, and thus more dense,

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.979
resulting in a smaller volume.

00:07:06.979 --> 00:07:12.720
The polarity of water also results in a phenomenon
that makes life possible: hydrogen bonding.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:17.160
The partially negative oxygen and positive
hydrogen atoms in a water molecule are not

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.479
100% faithful to each other.

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:25.020
They engage in additional kind of loose relationships with other neighboring hydrogen and oxygen atoms.

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:29.039
These loose, somewhat fleeting relationships
are called hydrogen bonds.

00:07:29.039 --> 00:07:33.499
In ice, 100% of O and H atoms are involved
in hydrogen bonding.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:37.220
The most energetically favorable spatial arrangement
of these bonds

00:07:37.229 --> 00:07:40.759
actually pushes the water molecules apart
a bit,

00:07:40.759 --> 00:07:45.550
resulting in the volume of ice being 10% larger
than the volume of water,

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:47.850
which is really weird for solids and liquids.

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:52.610
When ice melts, there are still about 80%
of Os and Hs engaged in hydrogen bonding,

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:57.289
creating ice-like clusters that keep the volume
of the cold water relatively high.

00:07:57.289 --> 00:07:59.220
With rising temperatures, these clusters disappear,

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:04.700
while the volume of the truly liquid water rises resulting in a major characteristic of water:

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:07.759
having its highest density at 4 °C.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:13.960
And yes, that's why ice floats on lakes in the winter and why the bottom of frozen lakes tends to be about 4 °C.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:18.199
And also why hockey was invented. And why soda bottles explode when you leave them in the freezer.

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:22.979
But hydrogen bonds are also why taking a warm bath is so great, why steam engines changed the world,

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:29.020
and why temperatures on our planet are so constant when compared to other cosmic temperature fluctuations.

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:32.430
It takes a lot of energy to change the temperature
of water

00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:37.980
because each little temperature change is associated with breaking or forming lots of hydrogen bonds,

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:40.599
and they absorb or give off a lot of heat.

00:08:40.599 --> 00:08:44.800
In fact, the specific heat capacity of water
is about five times that of common rocks.

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:49.060
And amazingly, we haven't even finished talking about how powerfully useful these partial charges are.

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:54.120
They also allow water to dissolve pretty much
anything that's even partially non-polar,

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:58.570
which includes sugars, proteins, ions, and
tons of inorganic chemicals.

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:05.000
Water and its useful little dipole moment can dissolve more compounds than any other chemical on Earth.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.100
Frankly, it's amazing that it doesn't dissolve
us from the inside out.

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:11.830
Which brings me to one last little polarity
tidbit, the hybrid molecule.

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:15.470
There are lots of different molecules, like
the surfactants in soap, for example, that

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:17.160
have both polar and non-polar areas.

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:25.320
Dish soap is thus able to dissolve the fatty parts of my butter catastrophe here, and then stick the polar sides out,

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:29.840
allowing the whole mess to get washed away
by Avogadro's numbers of polar water molecules

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:31.980
that I'm sticking on my hand right now.

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:35.230
Oh yeah.
That's better, but not...

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:40.360
I'm gonna have to go to the bathroom to get
this all the way fixed up. So, be right back.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:44.110
Likewise, the fatty acids that make up your
cell membranes have polar heads,

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:47.240
which keeps them interacting with the aqueous
environment of out bodies,

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:52.500
but non-polar tails, which prevent the cells from being just dissolved by the water around them.

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.240
Pretty dang elegant if you ask me.

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.260
Thanks for watching this episode of Crash
Course Chemistry.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.140
If you were paying attention, you learned
that

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:03.130
a molecule needs to have both charge asymmetry
and geometric asymmetry to be non-polar,

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:08.440
that charge asymmetry is caused by a difference in electronegativities, and that I am totally team polar.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:13.240
You also learned how to notate a dipole moment
or charge separation of a molecule,

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:16.430
the actual physical mechanism behind "like
dissolves like",

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:20.790
and why water is just so dang good at fostering
life on this planet.
