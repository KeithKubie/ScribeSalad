00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.610
We're asked to add 50 plus 0.

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:07.240
Well, zero is nothing.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.660
So you can imagine that we're
starting off with 50 of

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.890
something, and if we add nothing
to that 50, we're

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:16.320
still going to have 50
of that something.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.280
If I have three of something and
I added nothing, I'm still

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.680
going to have three, so anything
plus zero is going to

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.140
be whatever you started
off with.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:30.420
So 50 plus 0 is going
to still be 50.
