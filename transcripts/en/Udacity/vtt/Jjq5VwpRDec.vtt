00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.100
Before we wrap up, let's go over some assumptions and restrictions for chi

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.050
square tests. Just like with all tests, we have to make sure that we're

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:13.460
adhering to certain guidelines in order to do this test. First of all, we have

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:18.660
to avoid dependent observations. In the case of the Loftus and Palmer study,

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.960
the car crash one. Independence would be violated if the participants

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.400
contributed to data in more than just one of these cells. For example, if they

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.290
were asked both how fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other?

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.415
And how fast were the cars going when they hit each other? In other words these

00:00:38.415 --> 00:00:45.010
16 participants are totally different from all of these other participants.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.540
Whose data is in the other cells. Another thing we should do is avoid small

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.840
expected frequencies. And in general have a large number of participants.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.690
Remember that our chi-squared statistic is just based off the sample. We have a

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.370
sample of observations and corresponding expected values. If we were to use

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.760
this chi squared statistic to make inferences about the population that this

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.060
sample is from then the total number of participants should be at least 20. And

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.620
a conservative rule of thumb specifies that each expected cell frequency should

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:25.350
be at least 5. Recall that in our examples, the observed and expected values

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.060
were the observed and expected frequencies.
