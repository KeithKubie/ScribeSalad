ZACH: My name is
Zach, and I have

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.870
the honor of introducing Minh
Tsai-- founder and CEO of Hodo

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.590
Soy-- who's here to
talk about his journey

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:10.614
from investment
banker to tofu master

00:00:10.614 --> 00:00:12.030
and the growing
popularity of tofu

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.790
and soy products
here in America.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.610
I first met Minh
several months ago,

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.440
taking a tour of his
tofu factory in Oakland

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.160
with a small Google group, and
I wanted to kind of bring this

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.830
to other Googlers
in Mountain View who

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.150
weren't able to make the tour.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.700
It was very inspirational
and eye-opening for me

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.440
to see firsthand how he
grew this thriving business

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.310
from the ground up with
his passion for great tofu

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.620
and his risk to leave a
financially-stable position

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.320
and pursue his dream here.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.160
So it's found everywhere in
Michelin star restaurants

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.890
to the aisles of
Costco and Chipotle

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.437
sofritas and our Google cafes.

00:00:48.437 --> 00:00:51.020
Hodo Soy is revolutionizing our
understanding and appreciation

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.060
of tofu here in America, and
Minh is really leading that.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.603
So without further ado, welcome.

00:00:56.603 --> 00:00:57.478
MINH TSAI: Thank you.

00:00:57.478 --> 00:00:58.912
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:58.912 --> 00:01:00.830
All right.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.080
So I have about an hour.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.650
Right, Zach?

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:03.150
ZACH: Yeah.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.420
MINH TSAI: OK.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.140
Perfect.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.540
So it's up to you how you
want to spend that hour.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.150
I can spend a whole hour
talking about my transition

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.270
from investment banking to tofu.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:19.370
I can talk about tofu-making,
history, economic, chemistry.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.830
So let's do a show of hand.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.070
OK?

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.960
How many of you want
to know about my story?

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.480
OK.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.680
How many of you guys want
to know about tofu-making

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.922
and taste good tofu?

00:01:32.922 --> 00:01:33.910
All right.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:34.410
OK.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.460
So why don't we focus
on those two areas?

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.750
You know, and then I'll weave
in the history and all of that.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.740
And I'm going to try
to do that while I'm

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.000
cooking at the same time,
which is not an easy task.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.910
So let's keep on this
show of hand business.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.851
How many of you guys were in--
knows where tofu comes from?

00:01:54.851 --> 00:01:56.449
AUDIENCE: Soy.

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:57.240
AUDIENCE: Soybeans?

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.200
MINH TSAI: Soybeans.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.910
Excellent.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:59.590
Good answer.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:00.864
That was an easy one.

00:02:00.864 --> 00:02:02.780
What about geographically
where it comes from?

00:02:06.244 --> 00:02:06.910
AUDIENCE: China.

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:07.640
MINH TSAI: China.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.220
Great.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:08.850
Yes.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.980
And how long ago have we sort of
discovered, so to speak, tofu?

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.978
Anybody want to
venture to guess?

00:02:15.978 --> 00:02:17.495
AUDIENCE: 4,000 years ago.

00:02:17.495 --> 00:02:18.120
MINH TSAI: Yes.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.950
That's pretty good.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.620
Nobody really knows,
but 4,000 is close.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.500
And guess what?

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.700
That's pretty much
roughly around the time

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.020
that we actually have a
recording of people eating

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.000
beans, any kinds of beans.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.382
Do any of you guys eat beans
and cook beans at home?

00:02:40.382 --> 00:02:40.965
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:02:41.465 --> 00:02:43.266
MINH TSAI: How do
you cook beans?

00:02:43.266 --> 00:02:44.077
Go ahead.

00:02:44.077 --> 00:02:44.660
AUDIENCE: Hmm?

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:45.630
MINH TSAI: How do
you cook beans?

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:46.631
AUDIENCE: Boil in water.

00:02:46.631 --> 00:02:47.671
MINH TSAI: Boil in water.

00:02:47.671 --> 00:02:48.360
For how long?

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.110
AUDIENCE: Forever.

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.990
MINH TSAI: Forever, exactly.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:58.690
Well, the guy who discovered
tofu did it the exact same way.

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.040
So if you actually read
about any history of tofu,

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.120
which I know you
haven't-- but don't worry,

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.210
because in a few months, Olivia
Wu is going to bring in the guy

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:08.760
who wrote a "Book of Tofu."

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.830
I highly encourage you
guys attending his talk

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.210
because he wrote this
amazing book that talks

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:14.820
about the history of tofu.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.630
But he doesn't know where
tofu comes from either.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.070
So we're all speculating.

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.620
But essentially,
somebody somewhere

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.350
is cooking beans the same way
that everybody cooks beans.

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.180
You soak it, because
you get the dry beans.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.950
Right?

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.800
And the reason it's
dry is because we want

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.510
to store it for a long time.

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.920
And the more mature
the beans are,

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.940
the higher the amount
of protein in the beans.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.420
So universally,
we all eat beans.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.910
And we eat it in a
similar fashion, which

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.410
is we soak it and we cook it.

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.490
And the reason we do
that is because the beans

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:52.430
themselves don't want
us to digest them.

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.430
So there's this thing called the
"Ipsen inhibitor," which means,

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.060
in our body, we don't have
all the enzymes and everything

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.410
chemically to absorb all
the nutrition of the beans.

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.050
As such, we have to cook it.

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.400
Because if you eat raw
beans, like uncooked beans,

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.980
you can't digest it.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.224
You're going to
have a lot of gas.

00:04:16.224 --> 00:04:17.000
OK.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.240
So we cook it the same way.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:23.500
So he'll come back, and I
have to save this part for him

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.560
about where it comes from
because this is like the raison

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.340
d'etre of tofu.

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.500
But yes, so it's an
accidental discovery.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.000
OK.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.910
And I'll tell you
why in a minute

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.460
when the chef comes back.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.910
In the meantime,
I'll just skip ahead

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.540
and tell you tofu in America.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:42.360
How's that?

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.550
So I said earlier, there's
this guy named Bill Shurtleff.

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.820
He wrote the "Book of Tofu,"
and it was published in the US

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.520
in 1976.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.030
Some of you might
even have it at home.

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.280
But it's a seminal
book about tofu.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.380
And in it, he talks
about how it's

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:04.700
made, where it comes from,
the amazing varieties of tofu.

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:09.440
And he essentially ushered
in the first generation

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.060
of Westerners eating tofu.

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.230
Thank you, chef.

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.870
So now, we skip away
from Bill and come back

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.690
to the guy making tofu in Asia.

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.879
So he's cooking a pot of
beans, and he's probably not

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:24.170
very well-versed in cooking it.

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:26.410
So he had some excess
water, and then he

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:27.510
didn't want to waste it.

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:31.100
So he drained that, tasted it,
and it didn't taste that good.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.210
It tasted kind of beany.

00:05:36.072 --> 00:05:37.530
And then he thought,
oh, maybe I'll

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:40.490
add something to make it
taste better, like salt,

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.790
the first natural flavoring.

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:44.750
He added salt, and
it tasted better.

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.500
So you have a
savory soy milk kind

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.790
of thing, a savory bean juice.

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:52.220
And he started thinking, well,
maybe I'll add something else,

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.900
like vinegar.

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.340
That's another flavor.

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.155
And he added the acidity of the
vinegar, and what he discovered

00:05:59.155 --> 00:06:03.120
is this protein became a solid.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.030
So the first Chinese
word for tofu,

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.410
it's actually called
[CHINESE], which means

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.930
"the flower of the beans."

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:13.980
And you see me do that--
demonstrate that later.

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:18.340
So when you drop any
acid into any protein,

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:23.230
it could be cow milk
even, it becomes a curd.

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:27.690
So what he essentially created
was the first bean curd.

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:31.560
So that's an accidental
discovery of tofu.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.810
So if you read
the history books,

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:38.860
it says some prince wanted
to impress the emperor

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:39.890
and introduced it.

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:42.710
And none of that
is probably true.

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:44.310
Probably some
accidental discovery.

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:47.360
That's my theory, and I'm
sticking to it, because I'm

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.430
the tofu master now.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.670
So now going back to Bill
Shurtleff, who introduced

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:55.470
tofu in the US.

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:57.380
Some of you heard this before.

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:01.300
So tofu was consumed in
Asia for thousands of years,

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:05.090
and then it basically went
from China to Japan, Korea,

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:07.190
all throughout Southeast Asia.

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:11.000
And it followed all
the Asians, or the east

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.720
and the southeast
Asians that traveled

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:17.120
beyond Asia, like to the
US, to Africa, everywhere.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.780
And so tofu was brought along.

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:23.910
So when Bill Shurtleff wrote
the "Book of Tofu" in 1976,

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:27.100
it wasn't like tofu
didn't exist in the US.

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:28.840
It was around for
a hundred years

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.420
before Bill wrote the
book because the Chinese

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:35.130
and the Japanese have been here
farming and building railroads.

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:40.310
And they have tofu in
the Asian supermarkets.

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:42.956
But then the Westerners
really don't shop there.

00:07:42.956 --> 00:07:44.330
And even if they
did, they didn't

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.970
know what it was if they
could find it in the grocery

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:48.530
store in the first place.

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:51.970
But Bill wrote this book,
and everyone thought,

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:54.440
oh, my god, tofu, awesome.

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:55.535
I want to eat tofu.

00:07:55.535 --> 00:07:57.190
Where do I find tofu?

00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:01.160
And the trouble was, you
couldn't find tofu in the US

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.070
after you read this
book, this amazing book

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:06.580
about how delicious,
how amazing tofu is.

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:12.120
And so Western companies
started making tofu.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.190
So basically, he
introduced tofu,

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:16.200
and people couldn't find tofu.

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.140
So most people who
were brave enough

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:21.020
would go to Japantown and
Chinatown and buy tofu.

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:23.460
And imagine this
scenario if you're

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:25.240
buying tofu for the first time.

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.380
Your friends is telling
you, oh, this is amazing.

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:29.920
You know, you should go
to Chinatown and get it.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.350
You go to Chinatown.

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:34.429
You venture into
a grocery store,

00:08:34.429 --> 00:08:36.580
and you're looking
around for what

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:38.210
you think is a white block.

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:40.190
Because in the book, it
didn't have any photos.

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:42.480
It's just a drawing
of a block of tofu.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:42.980
OK.

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:45.410
So you've never seen it before.

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:47.760
So you go, and you're
looking a white block.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.040
And you look on the shelf.

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:51.230
You don't know
how it's packaged,

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:52.820
and you couldn't find it.

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:56.429
So you'd probably go home,
and you'd tell your friends,

00:08:56.429 --> 00:08:57.220
I couldn't find it.

00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:59.178
Or if you were brave
enough, you would actually

00:08:59.178 --> 00:09:04.370
go up to the checkout stall
and say, I'm looking for tofu,

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:06.340
and then the person
at the checkout

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:08.580
stand-- because tofu
is tofu everywhere.

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:09.080
Right?

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.870
The word is the same in
Chinese and any language.

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:14.820
The person will understand
you and say, oh, tofu.

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.300
And you say, yes.

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:18.800
And then he would say, OK.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:22.290
And he would grab a plastic
bag, if you were lucky,

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:24.280
and he will put it
around his wrist.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:28.040
And he will stick his hand
under a bucket right next to him

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:30.699
and pick up a block
of tofu in his hand

00:09:30.699 --> 00:09:32.990
and reverse the plastic back
and tie and hand it to you

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:35.076
like a block of gold fish.

00:09:35.076 --> 00:09:35.950
Now, if you're lucky.

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:38.510
If you're not lucky, he would
just take it with his hand

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:40.048
and put it in the plastic bag.

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:45.680
But that is how most
Westerners experienced tofu

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:49.160
for the first time after
the publication of the book.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:53.430
So you would take the tofu
home, and you're like, OK.

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:55.420
What do I do with this?

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:59.020
And often, at the time, either
you pan fry it or you grill it.

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:01.370
And if you happened to
be grilling something

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:04.570
and you bring it home
for a vegetarian eater,

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:05.760
you'd throw it on the grill.

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:08.259
And of course, it's going to
fall right through because it's

00:10:08.259 --> 00:10:12.270
jiggly, jello-y, like a block,
because it was not the firm

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:15.790
tofu that we're used
to eating today.

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:19.010
So after the Western
companies started

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:23.910
making tofu in the early
'80s, what they decided to do

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:28.000
is actually make the
tofu and then pressing it

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.160
so that it's firmer and firmer
to become more meat-like.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:35.180
So we Americans are
very innovative.

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:38.690
We invented the firm
and the extra firm tofu.

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:41.200
And the reason we
do that is because,

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:45.470
30, 40 years ago, we don't
have the Food Network.

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:48.180
We don't have a lot
of culinary programs.

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:51.230
People just don't know
how to cook as well.

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:55.140
We just came out of the whole
ready-made food, canned food

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:58.460
in the '50s, which
people didn't know what

00:10:58.460 --> 00:10:59.830
to do with food in general.

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:02.680
They were eating a lot
more industrialized food

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:03.740
at the time.

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:06.590
So cooking was not
something that people

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:10.850
do at home so much, and
also definitely not tofu.

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:13.450
So most people didn't
experience tofu

00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:16.640
the way it needed to be
experienced, which is like, oh,

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:18.160
what is it?

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:22.580
So now, you have Western
companies making firm tofu

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:25.010
to be more meat-like.

00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:27.870
Where I'm going with this
is because the whole book

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:31.170
introduced tofu as
a vegetarian food.

00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:33.510
And I usually joke
that it's kind

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:38.230
of like writing a match.com
profile and saying,

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:42.420
you know, I went to a good
school, and I have a good job,

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:47.200
and I'm smart and I'm fun, but
never say I'm good looking.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:47.700
You know?

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:49.660
Like, I'm hot.

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:52.280
Because the way he
introduced tofu,

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:54.770
he didn't really
say it tastes great.

00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:57.610
And unfortunately, for
him, in the "Book of Tofu,"

00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:02.370
the people who subsequently made
tofu didn't make a great tofu.

00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:04.050
And it's not their
fault, because they

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:07.060
were making a vegetarian
food first and foremost.

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.420
They were making
a meat substitute,

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:14.760
but they were also making a tofu
as a very unusual and new food

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:20.780
that economically need to align
to what tofu costs in Asia.

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:24.540
So they were also
making a cheaper tofu.

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:29.800
So between the introduction
of tofu as a vegetarian food,

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:33.050
between the economic
of tofu, most people

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:37.030
actually don't want
to pay more for tofu.

00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:42.730
So tofu costs about a
buck a block 40 years ago.

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:46.040
It's about a buck a block today.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:48.580
So when you look at
the economic of tofu,

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:53.270
there is a disincentive
for anyone making tofu

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:56.110
because there's
no market for it.

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:58.600
So you have a whole
generation of people

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:01.970
who are really
enthusiastic on eating tofu

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:04.180
and then encounter
poor experience

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:07.304
eating tofu and then raising
kids who are like, no way.

00:13:07.304 --> 00:13:08.220
I'm not touching that.

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:10.780
My mom made terrible
tofu turkey.

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:13.990
So you can't blame them
to not eating tofu,

00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:20.220
and you can't blame tofu
for not sort of rising.

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:23.190
There are many other types of
food that are very similar.

00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:26.370
I bet most of you guys all
know that lobsters used to be

00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:28.725
a prisoners' food in the '50s.

00:13:28.725 --> 00:13:32.130
You know, it wasn't
a gourmet food

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:36.130
until a gourmet chef decided
to make it a gourmet food.

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:38.720
Same with calamari.

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:42.100
People didn't want to
eat squid until someone

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:43.890
called it calamari.

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:46.480
Now it sounds so much better.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:48.660
So you know, sushi, same thing.

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:50.570
People didn't like
eating raw fish

00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:54.070
until somebody came and
said California roll.

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:56.990
But now, people are going back
to eating raw fish again--

00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:59.880
a purer form of sushi.

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.760
So food comes in these
really funny cycles.

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:03.680
Tofu is the same way.

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:06.530
It was introduced,
and it wasn't very

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:09.000
well-thought out in the
introduction process.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.230
Because Bill, again,
when he wrote the book,

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:13.770
it was more about
saving the planet.

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:16.372
It was about eating a
plant-based food that's

00:14:16.372 --> 00:14:18.330
going to save the planet
because we were having

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:21.110
all kinds of issues raising
enough food for the rising

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:23.830
population.

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:25.080
And also, it's the time.

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:25.600
Right?

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.670
Today you guys are
much more conscious,

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:30.020
not just because
you're here at Google,

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:31.430
but you're in California.

00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:33.760
You're in the Bay
Area, and you want

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.340
to know where food comes from.

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:37.250
You want to know about
health and nutrition.

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:43.300
There's so much more information
out there, thanks to you guys.

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:46.140
People are much more
conscientious today,

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:48.360
and they can access
information a lot more.

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:51.420
And from the
culinary standpoint,

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:54.640
it really helps people
to really understand

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:57.110
cooking and nutrition and
everything else better.

00:14:57.110 --> 00:15:00.280
So while Bill is a
product of his time,

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:03.970
and tofu and other forms
of food, back in the days,

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:09.770
also go through that funny
sort of like acceptance frame,

00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:13.310
Hodo is a product of
our time, of my time.

00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:15.902
So we're very successful
if you look at us

00:15:15.902 --> 00:15:18.360
and you don't know who we are,
and you're like, oh, my god.

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:20.050
Hodo, Chipotle.

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:23.060
We've been around for
10 years, but it's only

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:24.870
been the last five
years that we began

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:27.870
to see the rise of
tofu consumption again.

00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:30.020
Because after the
introduction of tofu,

00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:36.110
what you have is a chart where
a lot of Western tofu companies

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:40.030
were built, and then the
industry started in a decline.

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:45.160
And it continued to decline
until about 10 years ago.

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:47.740
And I'm an economics student.

00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:54.630
So when I started to
think about making tofu,

00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:57.310
I was very crazy
in that I wanted

00:15:57.310 --> 00:16:01.560
to make a delicious tofu that
I grew up eating in Vietnam.

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:05.060
So for me, definitely,
that had to be the case.

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:06.700
Make a tofu that
tastes good, because I

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:08.080
couldn't find good tofu.

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:10.680
But I also understood
the economics

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:13.679
of tofu, which I'm going to go
into now while this is still

00:16:13.679 --> 00:16:14.220
getting warm.

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:16.140
Perfect.

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:21.070
So tofu, as an
industry in the US,

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:25.050
after the rise of those
Western tofu companies,

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:31.240
people discovered that it sort
of had this really interesting

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:32.900
split.

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:34.860
You have some companies
that just are mom

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:37.580
and pops companies,
small tofu-makers,

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:42.870
very similar to Asia, which is
you make it for that community.

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:45.060
And then you have companies
that wanted to grow,

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:48.480
and most of these tend
to be Western companies.

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:51.620
They want to distribute
beyond the Bay Area,

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:53.130
beyond their community.

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:56.820
So you have this split
between small mom and pops

00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:00.110
and then a company growing
big into multimillion dollar

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:02.310
businesses.

00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:05.690
But what is the difference is
that all of these companies,

00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:09.010
despite the fact that they
have an economic split,

00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:12.630
they make very similar tofu,
which is a cheaper form of tofu

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:14.740
because of that competition.

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:17.240
Your mom and pop shop
can make better tofu,

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:21.339
but because of no
economy of scale,

00:17:21.339 --> 00:17:24.410
they have to make it as
competitive as the tofu

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:27.430
you would find at a supermarket.

00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:30.020
So if you have $1,
you need to figure out

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:33.410
whether you want to spend it
in the supermarket or locally,

00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:36.880
assuming you can
find it locally.

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:39.730
So tofu-making, you'll
see in a minute--

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:41.960
and you can also go
on Google and find

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:47.640
a lot of videos of us-- it's
really interesting, because you

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:49.750
can't be somewhere
in the middle.

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:51.950
You either are a mom
and pop or you really

00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:56.590
have to grow to be
sustainable because

00:17:56.590 --> 00:18:00.200
of the investments required to
build a production facility.

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:04.710
You cannot make tofu
in small, small scale.

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:06.940
So you have to make
it in big scale.

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:10.880
And there are sort of
industrial safety standards,

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:13.490
like a boiler, for example.

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:18.470
We have rules here that
if you want a boiler that

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:22.060
generate more than five
horsepowers of steam,

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:25.030
you need this massive
room that's bulletproof.

00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:28.700
And when it explodes,
nobody gets hurt.

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:32.350
So a lot of tofu-makers,
when they cook their soy milk

00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:36.380
using steam, had to either be
under five horsepower-- most

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:39.000
of them are-- or way bigger.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.100
So that's one example
I want to give you

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:42.300
in terms of how you built.

00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:48.450
And also, it's very
labor-intensive to make tofu,

00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:52.900
because to mechanize it
costs even so much more.

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:54.790
You would have to
spend $5 million

00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:59.370
to start a tofu business if you
want to mechanize everything.

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:02.610
So because of that split,
you have the small guys

00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:05.460
and you have the big guy
and nobody in between.

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:08.350
And the small guys are
always struggling to survive,

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:11.260
and the big guys basically
dominate the market

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:13.300
in the grocery store chains.

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:16.400
And at the time, chefs don't
really use a lot of tofu.

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:18.960
So you basically
have a retail market,

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:22.890
but essentially dominated
by the big guys.

00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:27.090
So they dictate the
price, the texture,

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:28.880
whatever tofu you're getting.

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.840
And you have the little
guys, who basically,

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:32.860
after the first
generation-- like San Jose

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:35.760
Tofu-- the kids don't want
to take over the business

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:37.610
because it's really hard work.

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:40.080
And we've seen this
over and over again.

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:45.210
I pretty much know 60% of all
the tofu plants in the US,

00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:48.590
and I hear this story
over and over again.

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:51.290
While I'm trying to get
people to build tofu business,

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:54.470
they're going under faster than
I can get people to build it,

00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:56.940
and the reason for that
is purely economics.

00:19:56.940 --> 00:20:00.600
So when I started this
business, in my mind,

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:03.800
because of my banking background
and consulting and economic,

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:08.380
I knew that I did not want
to build a small plant,

00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:10.742
but I also didn't want
to build a big plant.

00:20:10.742 --> 00:20:12.700
I wanted to build something
right in the middle

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:17.350
because, if I'm correct,
which I have been so far,

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:20.670
this is the hardest
space to be in.

00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:24.720
So that's my barrier to entry
to starting my business.

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:25.220
OK.

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:29.240
So it doesn't mean I don't want
somebody else to do what I do.

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:33.290
I would love to have another
business doing what I do,

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:36.100
because I think the
industry is young enough

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:39.680
that, if you have people
making delicious tofu,

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:41.470
you get more people eating it.

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:46.100
And I've proven that because
most of our customers

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:49.060
initially are
actually new to tofu.

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:52.830
And how we began to think
about winning our customers

00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:57.250
is focusing on taste and not
on everything else that people

00:20:57.250 --> 00:21:01.940
are focusing on-- vegetarianism,
veganism, meat substitution,

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:04.280
any of that, or health, even.

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:07.340
So what I end up
making is a tofu

00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:12.830
that tastes-- hopefully, to you
as well as to me-- really good.

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:16.600
And that takes us into the
whole chemistry of tofu.

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:18.850
So to make a good-tasting
tofu, how many of you

00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:22.550
guys have traveled to
Asia and eaten tofu there?

00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:24.551
China or Southeast Asia?

00:21:24.551 --> 00:21:25.050
OK.

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:26.800
Japan?

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:27.400
Excellent.

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:29.250
Did you eat tofu
of any form of tofu

00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:31.834
when you were in Japan or China?

00:21:31.834 --> 00:21:33.000
AUDIENCE: For several years.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.010
MINH TSAI: OK.

00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:34.980
There you go.

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:37.740
You want to be sitting
here answering Q&amp;A later?

00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:43.940
And was it delicious when
you ate tofu in Asia?

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:44.630
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:45.213
MINH TSAI: OK.

00:21:45.213 --> 00:21:49.510
And did you find the
same type of tofu here?

00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:51.687
AUDIENCE: Trader Joe's
actually isn't too bad.

00:21:51.687 --> 00:21:52.270
MINH TSAI: OK.

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:54.049
AUDIENCE: And San
Jose Tofu is fine.

00:21:54.049 --> 00:21:54.840
MINH TSAI: Exactly.

00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:57.180
San Jose Tofu makes great tofu.

00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:58.070
I agree.

00:21:58.070 --> 00:22:02.910
So it's really not that
easy, at least, for me.

00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:05.690
I have very high
standard for tofu.

00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:06.720
So I couldn't find it.

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:08.360
That's why I decided to make it.

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:10.980
But one of the first things you
need to do to make good tofu

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:13.860
is actually the soy milk.

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:17.670
Because people are not
familiar with the taste of soy,

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:19.330
your first introduction
of soy milk

00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:24.210
is probably Silk, which is
a very successful company.

00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:27.290
And they've managed
to basically take

00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:32.550
all the flavors of
soybeans out and make

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:36.010
it taste as close to
cow milk as possible

00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:38.050
in order to sell soy milk.

00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:41.110
So that's a battle I'm trying
to basically go against.

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:43.400
And right now, I can
say I'm winning today.

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:46.750
But now, for the
last 9.8 years, I've

00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:50.260
been losing, because
what I'm trying to do

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:55.680
is actually make people enjoy
the flavor of the beans.

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:59.310
And in Asia, when we eat a
tofu and we drank soy milk,

00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:00.710
we wanted that.

00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:03.935
We want, mmm, this
is really beany.

00:23:03.935 --> 00:23:04.935
This is really fragrant.

00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:11.030
So when I make a tofu,
that's what I emphasize on.

00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:13.220
Because I didn't want
it just to sell it

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:17.780
to people who think of tofu
as a meat substitute, who

00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:21.050
can cover up, whatever.

00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:24.880
You add flavors to it, and
that's a flavor you're eating.

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:27.090
It's just a vehicle
for that flavors.

00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:28.380
I hate it when people do that.

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:31.040
Like, eggplant is a
vehicle for flavors.

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:32.970
Tofu is a vehicle for flavor.

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:33.820
No.

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:37.000
Every single one of these items
actually has a distinct taste.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.730
You just haven't had an
opportunity to taste it.

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:42.045
So that's what we do at Hodo.

00:23:42.045 --> 00:23:46.470
As sort of tofu ambassadors,
we want people to say, oh, wow.

00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:47.130
You know?

00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:49.910
I didn't know that
tofu has a taste.

00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:53.920
And not only that, I didn't know
that it can taste this good.

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:56.840
So that's what we try to
do, and to do that, we

00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:58.480
need to make a yummy tofu.

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:00.690
So we start with the soy milk.

00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:04.540
To get really good soy milk,
you need a thick soy milk.

00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:09.250
It's kind of like whole
cow milk versus skim milk.

00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:13.910
Most tofu companies today,
because of economics and yield

00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:18.180
and whatnot, use something
much akin to a skim milk

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:20.190
to make tofu.

00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:23.400
And you can do that because
you add more coagulant,

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:26.510
and it becomes a chalkier tofu.

00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:28.880
So that's essentially
the difference.

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:32.100
Really good tofu
is very pliable,

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:37.010
which means that you
actually favor the milk more

00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:38.110
than the coagulant.

00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:40.510
The proportion is different.

00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:44.840
For our tofu, we use
about 1% coagulant.

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:48.930
Most tofu use probably
closer to 4% or 5%.

00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:50.720
And you can see it
in the protein level

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:53.500
if you look at the
nutritional panels of tofu.

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:56.235
If you buy our firm tofu,
it will say about 16,

00:24:56.235 --> 00:24:58.540
17 grams per serving.

00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:02.740
Most tofu don't even
get to double digits.

00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:06.380
So the whole soy milk, so
that's the first thing we do.

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:11.580
And all our soybeans we
actually source from farmers

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:12.700
in the Midwest.

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:17.610
We contract them to grow
it for us every 12 months.

00:25:17.610 --> 00:25:19.500
So we work with a
large cooperative,

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:21.270
and we probably
source from a dozen

00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:23.370
different small organic farmers.

00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:25.590
And we'll commit to
that going forward.

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:27.440
So do you guys
have any questions

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:29.710
so far before I launch
into tofu-making

00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:31.860
and talk more about chemistry?

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:33.523
Nobody's falling asleep yet.

00:25:33.523 --> 00:25:34.022
Yes.

00:25:34.473 --> 00:25:35.764
AUDIENCE: You guys are organic.

00:25:35.764 --> 00:25:38.320
So you have no source
of GMO product going in?

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:41.740
MINH TSAI: Everything we source
is 100% organic and non-GMO.

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:43.180
All about ingredients.

00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:44.560
Wherever we can.

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:46.830
If it exists, we'll get it.

00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:50.810
We are the most expensive
tofu, but it's not very

00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:54.600
expensive relatively speaking.

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:55.260
All right.

00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:59.630
So what I have
here is a soy milk.

00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:02.120
This is the soy milk
we use to make tofu.

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:05.860
And what I needed to do is I
needed to heat it up first.

00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:08.180
And when I heat soy milk,
what I have is [CHINESE].

00:26:11.029 --> 00:26:12.320
And some of you have seen this.

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:14.990
This is essentially
the cream of soy milk.

00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:17.370
If you drink Straus
milk, you still

00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:20.270
get the cream that
rises to the top.

00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:22.070
This is essentially
the same thing,

00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:25.100
because cow milk has
all that protein.

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:27.240
The difference is,
chemically speaking, is this

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:30.490
is a much more
pliable, flexible piece

00:26:30.490 --> 00:26:35.210
of sort of cream
versus a cow milk cream

00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:40.080
is much more brittle, so it
doesn't have the elasticity.

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:43.640
So this can be manipulated
into all kinds of stuff,

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:45.560
like you guys had
for lunch today.

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:46.875
So I'll put this aside.

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:50.409
AUDIENCE: There's
some cups here.

00:26:50.409 --> 00:26:51.242
MINH TSAI: Oh, yeah.

00:26:51.242 --> 00:26:52.611
Put it into the cup.

00:26:52.611 --> 00:26:53.110
Yeah.

00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:54.240
Somebody can eat it.

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:56.410
It's yummy now.

00:26:56.410 --> 00:27:02.380
So to make tofu, besides the
milk, we need a coagulant.

00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:04.540
You see how this
is sort of settled?

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:07.224
This is gypsum.

00:27:07.224 --> 00:27:08.880
[KNOCKING]

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:11.490
The "plaster of Paris,"
as they call it.

00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:15.790
Except plaster, or gypsum,
is actually a mineral.

00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:18.320
It's basically calcium sulphate.

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:21.393
This is a pure food-grade
form, so don't worry.

00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:28.440
And we use this because this
is the original coagulant found

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:30.120
in Asia, in China.

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:32.230
And it's a mineral
in the ground.

00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:34.950
And the reason that the
Chinese started using this

00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:38.310
is because they also flavored
the beans themselves.

00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:44.290
This is one of the few
minerals cheap enough

00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:49.190
to get that does not mask
any of the bean's flavor.

00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:50.570
It brings it out.

00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:55.270
It allows it to stand alone,
the flavor of the soy beans.

00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:56.930
If you go to Japan,
you might have

00:27:56.930 --> 00:28:00.860
had a tofu that's made with
what we call nigari, which

00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:04.550
is a calcium magnesium
chloride, which

00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:06.780
is a byproduct of sea salt.

00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:09.540
And the reason the
Japanese use that

00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:12.560
is because they actually
didn't have a lot of calcium

00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:14.510
sulfate in Japan.

00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:16.520
So they had to use a
different coagulant,

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:18.940
and the chloride
there sometimes leaves

00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:21.450
a slightly bitter flavor.

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:25.160
That's why some people
originally called

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:27.640
that coagulation a bittern.

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:30.500
The term bittern is from that.

00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:33.120
I'm shaking it up because
calcium sulfate is not

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:35.220
a water soluble.

00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:37.470
So I need to sort
of keep it mixed.

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:43.020
You see why.

00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:44.890
Any questions so far?

00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:45.580
No?

00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:46.450
Mesmerized?

00:28:46.450 --> 00:28:47.950
[CHUCKLING]

00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:49.670
Just kidding.

00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:50.580
All right.

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:53.559
So normally, this is where
my colleagues are like,

00:28:53.559 --> 00:28:54.850
don't need to measure this out?

00:28:54.850 --> 00:28:57.360
Like, I'm a tofu master, man.

00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:00.812
I know how much this
is going to take.

00:29:00.812 --> 00:29:04.230
Watch me screw this up good.

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:04.730
All right.

00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:07.820
So I have that, and I'm
going to pour some in here.

00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:10.430
Because it's not
a water soluble,

00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:12.440
I need to mix it somehow.

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:15.660
So besides mixing it
here, when I pour it

00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:19.060
in here, when I pour
the soy milk in there,

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:20.820
it needs to mix as well.

00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:26.630
So this is where the "tofu
master" title comes in handy.

00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:29.420
Don't do this at home
without supervision.

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:31.340
So I have the calcium
sulphate in there.

00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:31.840
OK.

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:36.300
And as you can see, it's already
settling again, but that's OK.

00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:37.896
So the milk needs to be heated.

00:29:37.896 --> 00:29:39.520
And the reason we
need to heat the milk

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:43.190
is, when you heat
any liquid, the atoms

00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:45.540
are flying all over the place,
and that's what we want.

00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:49.430
So when we pour it in
here, we want those atoms

00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:51.980
to be loose and start binding
with the calcium sulfate.

00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:53.380
That's essential.

00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:56.289
So I have a gallon
of soy milk here.

00:29:56.289 --> 00:29:58.330
AUDIENCE: What temperature
did you heat the milk?

00:29:58.330 --> 00:29:59.413
MINH TSAI: Great question.

00:29:59.413 --> 00:30:03.290
So it needs to be roughly
about-- I usually heat it

00:30:03.290 --> 00:30:06.080
beyond kill step, which is 165.

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:08.650
So when it's super hot,
it doesn't help either.

00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:13.430
So generally, it's
about 165 to 185.

00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:16.100
And so here is the hard part.

00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:19.480
And actually, I'm going to do
it here so I don't hurt myself,

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:21.566
and you can see better, too.

00:30:21.566 --> 00:30:22.860
I'll bring it up front.

00:30:27.490 --> 00:30:29.980
So you have the coagulant here.

00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:33.710
And when I pour it, I want
to pour it in a steady form.

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:38.010
So somebody said, which is
true, the hardest tofu to make

00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:39.910
is the softest tofu.

00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:41.690
And I'll explain
why in a second.

00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:44.020
So I'm going to
pour it, and I want

00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:47.326
that pouring to be mixing
that calcium sulfate in there

00:30:47.326 --> 00:30:48.075
without splashing.

00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:53.492
I want you guys to
applaud when I'm done.

00:30:56.790 --> 00:30:58.295
See, it's actually
mixing naturally?

00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:04.325
Where is the applause?

00:31:04.325 --> 00:31:07.000
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.290
Thank you.

00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:12.130
So if I did a better job, you
wouldn't see the bubble on top.

00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:14.360
And the reason we-- I say
the hardest tofu to make

00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:18.140
is the softest tofu is,
if you get this wrong,

00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:19.940
it's not going to
be that smooth.

00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:22.505
It's going to be like, what I
said, the flour, like chunks.

00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:26.220
You have some protein
that didn't really

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:30.680
coagulate with the
coagulant, and you basically

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:32.920
lose some of that protein.

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:36.600
So here, in about
one minute, it's

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:39.160
already forming into a solid.

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:41.570
And the reason that it's
harder to make this is,

00:31:41.570 --> 00:31:48.804
if I mess this up-- which I
didn't-- I can always just pour

00:31:48.804 --> 00:31:50.720
all of this into a
cheesecloth and squeeze it,

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:53.400
and it becomes a
firm block of tofu.

00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:54.420
See?

00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:58.304
So if I don't get this right,
I can still make firm tofu.

00:31:58.304 --> 00:31:59.470
But I cannot make soft tofu.

00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:02.190
I have to-- a
completely new batch.

00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:04.410
So here, I'll jiggle it.

00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:04.990
See that?

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:08.840
Now, you have a choice.

00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:10.980
Oops.

00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:11.930
Nobody told me.

00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:13.660
You have a choice.

00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:18.688
You can eat that, or I
can make it into tofu.

00:32:18.688 --> 00:32:20.086
AUDIENCE: I wanna eat that.

00:32:20.086 --> 00:32:22.416
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:22.416 --> 00:32:23.650
That's not tofu?

00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:24.650
MINH TSAI: This is tofu.

00:32:24.650 --> 00:32:25.484
This is silken tofu.

00:32:25.484 --> 00:32:26.399
AUDIENCE: Silken tofu.

00:32:26.399 --> 00:32:27.000
MINH TSAI: OK.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.592
Now, to make it in a block
a tofu, I break that up.

00:32:30.592 --> 00:32:35.220
I put it in this really
beautiful wooden mold

00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:39.120
with a cheesecloth, and I
turn it into a block that big.

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:42.270
You can eat that tofu, too.

00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:44.920
But I can tell you, from
personal experience,

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:48.305
that this might be just the
most delicious tofu you've ever

00:32:48.305 --> 00:32:48.805
eaten.

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:51.940
And if we have
time-- oh, we do--

00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:53.650
I can make another tofu thing.

00:32:53.650 --> 00:32:55.470
I'll boil some more soy milk.

00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:56.970
So you guys want
to try eating that?

00:32:56.970 --> 00:32:57.550
I highly recommend it.

00:32:57.550 --> 00:32:57.940
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:32:57.940 --> 00:32:59.773
MINH TSAI: So I'll leave
you to the serving.

00:32:59.773 --> 00:33:00.638
AUDIENCE: Oh, sure.

00:33:01.252 --> 00:33:02.960
AUDIENCE: Will we have
to use those cups.

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:03.350
MINH TSAI: It is.

00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:03.610
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:33:03.610 --> 00:33:04.276
MINH TSAI: Yeah.

00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:07.450
Excellent.

00:33:09.991 --> 00:33:10.490
Yeah.

00:33:13.770 --> 00:33:17.070
So imagine me
growing up in Asia.

00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:19.066
There's another spoon
if you want to use it.

00:33:19.066 --> 00:33:19.566
Yeah.

00:33:19.566 --> 00:33:20.790
AUDIENCE: How big
should the scoops be?

00:33:20.790 --> 00:33:22.590
MINH TSAI: Oh, you can have a
bigger scoop because people are

00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:23.756
going to want bigger pieces.

00:33:23.756 --> 00:33:24.500
That's perfect.

00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:26.040
Yeah.

00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:32.320
When I grew up in Asia, somebody
walks around with a basket,

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:35.190
yelling "tofu," and
that's what they

00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:38.170
were selling hot with a
little bit of ginger sauce

00:33:38.170 --> 00:33:39.060
or something.

00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:40.840
But I didn't want to
give you guys ginger

00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:44.266
sauce because I didn't want
to mask any of that flavor.

00:33:44.266 --> 00:33:47.164
AUDIENCE: So what is the
method of making the soy milk?

00:33:47.164 --> 00:33:49.537
Because you've boiled
the beans and then--

00:33:49.537 --> 00:33:50.620
MINH TSAI: Great question.

00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:51.990
AUDIENCE: And then
grind it or something?

00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:52.615
MINH TSAI: Yes.

00:33:52.615 --> 00:33:58.110
So to make soy milk, we
basically soak the milk

00:33:58.110 --> 00:34:02.090
overnight until it's
completely rehydrated.

00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:12.120
And then we grind it into
a slurry, like a mush,

00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:15.610
sort of like an oatmeal mush.

00:34:15.610 --> 00:34:19.380
And then we cook it at
a very high temperature

00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:24.020
so that it's cooked.

00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:28.270
And then we separate
the beans from the pulp,

00:34:28.270 --> 00:34:29.830
and then we extract the milk.

00:34:29.830 --> 00:34:31.690
This is a very
traditional method

00:34:31.690 --> 00:34:37.739
of making tofu, because
in modern day tofu-making,

00:34:37.739 --> 00:34:41.360
for efficiency's sake, some
people just soak the beans,

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:44.530
grind it, separate it, and
then just cook the milk.

00:34:44.530 --> 00:34:48.219
But we actually have a
double extraction process

00:34:48.219 --> 00:34:54.850
where after we cook
the beans, we actually

00:34:54.850 --> 00:34:57.080
don't throw away the pulp.

00:34:57.080 --> 00:35:03.140
We actually rinse it again
to extract it a second time

00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:06.310
to get more flavors out of it.

00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:07.880
So that's what we
do to maintain.

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:08.610
What do you guys think?

00:35:08.610 --> 00:35:09.065
AUDIENCE: All good.

00:35:09.065 --> 00:35:10.840
MINH TSAI: It's
pretty amazing, right?

00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:11.616
Yeah.

00:35:11.616 --> 00:35:12.115
So--

00:35:12.115 --> 00:35:14.820
AUDIENCE: It tastes better
than what they serve here.

00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:16.656
How do they ruin it?

00:35:17.155 --> 00:35:21.460
MINH TSAI: Hey, you're
sitting next to a chef.

00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:22.380
No.

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:27.244
The thing is, you
can make that here.

00:35:27.244 --> 00:35:28.660
You just need to
buy our soy milk.

00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:31.665
And in fact, some chefs
have down it here before.

00:35:34.210 --> 00:35:38.640
And again, you have the
opportunity to eat it, like,

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:40.440
made on the spot.

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:44.050
But if I leave that-- and
you'll see, in a few minutes--

00:35:44.050 --> 00:35:48.650
that will actually started
leaching water soon.

00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:52.560
So here what I started
out with a bind, what

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:54.870
I would say close
to a perfect bind,

00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:57.850
meaning that I'm not
wasting any soy milk or any

00:35:57.850 --> 00:35:59.870
of the coagulant.

00:35:59.870 --> 00:36:03.510
Now, if I put too much
coagulant, you know,

00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:05.740
it's going to be chunky.

00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:09.720
If I put too little, it's not
going to be a smooth cream.

00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:13.190
So because I'm a tofu
master, I've got it down.

00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:18.700
But over time, that bind will
actually start splitting,

00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:21.800
and you're going to get
water as a byproduct.

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:23.550
So tofu leaches
water all the time.

00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:27.287
That's why, when I talk to the
chefs at Green's Restaurant--

00:36:27.287 --> 00:36:28.120
they've been around.

00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:29.970
They've used tofu
for a long time.

00:36:29.970 --> 00:36:34.220
They buy our "extra firm"
tofu, and they marinate it

00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:36.360
in a broth for a whole week.

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:39.420
And it's still only
on the surface.

00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:44.520
So I talked them into using our
tofu, because I said to them,

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:50.660
I said, at least after people
eat your delicious flavoring

00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:54.440
marinade, they still have a
delicious tofu underneath.

00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:57.720
Because before, you had a
delicious flavoring marinade,

00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:01.140
but you had a terrible
chalky tofu underneath.

00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:04.230
So that's the goal here
is, for the longest time,

00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:06.210
I didn't want to make a
firm tofu because it's

00:37:06.210 --> 00:37:10.690
so hard to work
with, because people

00:37:10.690 --> 00:37:12.410
don't know how to use it.

00:37:12.410 --> 00:37:15.000
The firmer it is,
the harder it is

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.580
in terms of textures
and flavor for people.

00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:20.070
But finally, I said, OK.

00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:21.660
People really want a firm tofu.

00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:23.930
How can I make a firm
tofu that actually tastes

00:37:23.930 --> 00:37:27.420
better, at least better to me?

00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:32.520
And if you actually do a tofu
taste test with our tofu--

00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:37.340
again, the firm tofu-- you will
actually taste the following.

00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:41.960
You will taste first a
really beany, nutty flavor,

00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:44.510
because it's there.

00:37:44.510 --> 00:37:45.740
I don't try to hide it.

00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:49.330
And secondly, you'll
taste a slight sweetness

00:37:49.330 --> 00:37:54.830
of the beans themselves that
you won't taste in other tofu.

00:37:54.830 --> 00:37:59.810
So you'll see a nutty, beany,
buttery sweetness to our tofu,

00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:05.980
and that's why I think
people begin to buy our tofu.

00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:09.570
And it's only a matter of time
because you get a better tofu

00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:15.326
from Trader Joe's, if I have
my ways, which I think I do.

00:38:15.326 --> 00:38:19.070
Oh, that's being recorded.

00:38:19.070 --> 00:38:20.850
Everything's
recorded these days.

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:22.250
Yes.

00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:24.250
AUDIENCE: So what's the
difference between using

00:38:24.250 --> 00:38:25.650
sprouted beans or just--

00:38:25.650 --> 00:38:26.400
MINH TSAI: Oh.

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:28.140
You ask all the best questions.

00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:31.630
They planted you here.

00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:35.280
OK, how many of you guys eat
sort of like sprouted stuff?

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:35.780
OK.

00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:38.040
I love sprouted stuff.

00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:40.680
I love any kinds
of young shoots,

00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:43.560
whether it's vegetables
or anything that's young.

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:45.530
It's just tastier.

00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:48.060
But here's the problem with
sprouted when you cook.

00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:51.230
What happens when you
cook something sprouted?

00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:54.480
All that nutrition is gone.

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:57.470
It's the most brilliant
tofu marketing

00:38:57.470 --> 00:38:58.730
I've ever come across.

00:38:58.730 --> 00:39:00.040
[LAUGHING]

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:01.350
It's so true.

00:39:01.350 --> 00:39:04.970
So what happened was-- again,
it's totally accidental.

00:39:04.970 --> 00:39:06.380
I've seen this.

00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:09.420
We've soaked beans, and we
couldn't use up the beans

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:11.320
because the machines are down.

00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:14.810
So we don't want to waste
300 pounds of soybeans.

00:39:14.810 --> 00:39:20.170
We stick it in the refrigerator
overnight, over the weekend.

00:39:20.170 --> 00:39:21.920
Sometimes, we forget about it.

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:24.110
And guess what happens
when we forget about it?

00:39:24.110 --> 00:39:24.480
AUDIENCE: Waste?

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:25.271
MINH TSAI: Exactly.

00:39:25.271 --> 00:39:27.020
Do we want to throw that away?

00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:28.380
No, we don't.

00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:30.800
But we still process
it the same way.

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:34.530
We still cook the
heck out of it.

00:39:34.530 --> 00:39:40.180
So all that nutrition of raw
and sprout, it's all gone.

00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:43.220
But it's brilliant, because
the company I came up with it--

00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:46.420
and I won't mention names--
that's exactly what happened.

00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:47.780
Their machine went down.

00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:50.550
Most likely, they
had tons of soybeans,

00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:53.400
and it took them a week
to fix the machine.

00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:56.190
And they have sprouted soybeans,
and they used it anyway.

00:39:58.380 --> 00:40:00.000
But nutritionally
speaking, there

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.990
is no advantage, unfortunately.

00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:06.010
But any types of bean sprouts--
because what happens is,

00:40:06.010 --> 00:40:08.750
when a bean itself
starts sprouting,

00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:12.550
the chemistry of that
bean changes and it

00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:15.420
allows for better absorption.

00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:18.450
Nuts, same thing.

00:40:18.450 --> 00:40:19.030
Legumes.

00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:21.650
All legumes, when it's
sprouted, it's saying,

00:40:21.650 --> 00:40:23.760
OK, I'm going to give up now.

00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:24.990
You can eat me.

00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:28.570
And you can digest
me much better.

00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:29.370
Right?

00:40:29.370 --> 00:40:31.750
But then if you're going
to go ahead and cook me,

00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:35.880
then all of that, no.

00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:37.585
But I love the marketing.

00:40:37.585 --> 00:40:39.710
One day, we're going to
come up with sprouted tofu,

00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:44.550
too, when I have enough space
to actually let beans sprout.

00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:46.960
So-- but that's
a great question.

00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:49.680
Any other questions
before the next batch?

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:50.707
Yes?

00:40:50.707 --> 00:40:51.714
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:51.714 --> 00:40:52.380
MINH TSAI: Yeah.

00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:56.510
And we actually
used to give tours.

00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:59.600
We work a lot with Bon
Appetit to give tours,

00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:02.590
but we're growing
so quickly that we

00:41:02.590 --> 00:41:05.800
sort of took over the tourist
base, which is about this size.

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:07.850
And now it's our
employee lounge.

00:41:07.850 --> 00:41:10.520
So in a few months,
we'll co-opt it back,

00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:13.270
and we can do more tours.

00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:18.030
And I've come now and done
culinary classes with Chef

00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:19.330
down here before.

00:41:19.330 --> 00:41:24.710
Olivia Wu, who's a huge advocate
of us down here, talk to her.

00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:27.300
She'll bring me down.

00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:30.834
I don't say no to her.

00:41:30.834 --> 00:41:31.750
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:32.416
MINH TSAI: Yeah.

00:41:32.416 --> 00:41:36.980
And usually, for that class, I
do a little bit more in-depth

00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:40.690
about textures and flavors-- you
know, have handouts and stuff

00:41:40.690 --> 00:41:42.230
so you can understand.

00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:48.880
Because I don't do a lot of
consulting because most chefs

00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:52.620
don't actually ask
a lot of advice

00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:54.690
because they have gone
to culinary school,

00:41:54.690 --> 00:41:55.940
and I'm not a chef.

00:41:55.940 --> 00:42:01.450
But I'm happy to provide any
advice when it comes to tofu.

00:42:01.450 --> 00:42:03.570
We're almost ready
for the next batch.

00:42:03.570 --> 00:42:06.670
Can somebody do me a favor
and actually pour this out?

00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:09.020
Because I can't use
that up anymore.

00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:09.520
Yeah.

00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:10.537
I just need a--

00:42:10.537 --> 00:42:11.620
AUDIENCE: This poured out?

00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:12.286
MINH TSAI: Yeah.

00:42:12.286 --> 00:42:14.480
Yes, please.

00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:15.121
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:42:15.121 --> 00:42:16.370
MINH TSAI: That you can leave.

00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:20.630
So if you can pour that out
somewhere, that would be great.

00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:22.255
AUDIENCE: It's like
that birthday cake.

00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:24.720
MINH TSAI: So you
can just eat it.

00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:25.220
Yeah.

00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:28.140
Can you guys see the water
there that's leaching out?

00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:29.927
That's essentially what happens.

00:42:29.927 --> 00:42:30.760
AUDIENCE: Is it hot?

00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:31.770
MINH TSAI: It's not hot.

00:42:31.770 --> 00:42:35.210
It's lukewarm, but
it's still good.

00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:38.390
Tofu does not get
spoiled because, when

00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:41.035
you finish making
the tofu, it's still

00:42:41.035 --> 00:42:44.500
at what we call not
in the "danger zone."

00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:49.310
So when it comes to any types
of food, they call it 140/40.

00:42:49.310 --> 00:42:55.310
So you want it to be below 40
degrees F or above 140 degrees

00:42:55.310 --> 00:43:00.050
F. Anything in between,
it's when the food is more

00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:01.980
susceptible to contamination.

00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:02.660
AUDIENCE: Hmm.

00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:05.730
MINH TSAI: So the beauty about
tofu is that, when you make it,

00:43:05.730 --> 00:43:07.890
it's above 140.

00:43:07.890 --> 00:43:12.480
So then the trick is, how
do you get it from 140 to 40

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:14.890
as quickly as possible without
it getting contaminated?

00:43:17.570 --> 00:43:19.630
Most people don't
think about that.

00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:21.630
The reason they don't
care is because most tofu

00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:25.330
is consumed that day.

00:43:25.330 --> 00:43:27.646
They don't leave it longer.

00:43:27.646 --> 00:43:29.520
And then another way
you can sort of get away

00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:32.450
with that is, if you put
the block of tofu in water,

00:43:32.450 --> 00:43:33.520
it pushes water out.

00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:36.200
And if you keep rinsing
that water in the bucket,

00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:42.780
then that tofu has fewer
opportunity for contamination.

00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:45.670
But tofu goes bad
really quickly,

00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:48.680
especially if you use
a high protein tofu.

00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:52.210
So our tofu, if we make it
the same way as other people

00:43:52.210 --> 00:43:55.160
and we treat it, it
will go bad faster.

00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:59.570
But fortunately, we
are very hygienic.

00:43:59.570 --> 00:44:02.760
And so we actually have
the longest-lasting,

00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:06.160
non-pasteurized
tofu in the world,

00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:08.820
not because we put some
chemicals or anything in it.

00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:11.300
It's because, as soon
as the tofu comes out

00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:15.680
of the cheesecloth, that's
the first time that somebody's

00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:17.520
touching it.

00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:21.100
And as the probability
of contamination rises,

00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:23.840
that's where we're
most vigilant.

00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:24.510
You know?

00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:28.170
The tofu cutting board,
the knife, the gloved hand.

00:44:28.170 --> 00:44:30.670
They need to be changed,
the cheesecloths when used.

00:44:30.670 --> 00:44:31.870
Blah, blah, blah.

00:44:31.870 --> 00:44:34.770
And so as soon as it
comes out and it gets cut,

00:44:34.770 --> 00:44:38.850
we put it in a package and
we cool it down very quickly.

00:44:38.850 --> 00:44:43.080
So our tofu will we remain
relatively fresh and tasty

00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:45.340
after 25 days.

00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:50.730
And even the largest companies
that make tofu cannot do that

00:44:50.730 --> 00:44:56.350
because, their whole process
is different than ours.

00:44:56.350 --> 00:45:00.410
So we're very proud of
that, the ability for us

00:45:00.410 --> 00:45:06.560
to make a tofu that will last
and stay fresh for a long time.

00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:09.090
So any other questions?

00:45:09.090 --> 00:45:09.590
Yes?

00:45:09.590 --> 00:45:09.983
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:45:09.983 --> 00:45:11.750
I have a question, because I
went to Greens this weekend.

00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:12.130
MINH TSAI: Oh.

00:45:12.130 --> 00:45:12.631
Lucky you.

00:45:12.631 --> 00:45:13.921
AUDIENCE: The tofu was awesome.

00:45:13.921 --> 00:45:15.280
MINH TSAI: The brochette, yes.

00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:17.750
AUDIENCE: And how
does your tofu get

00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:19.490
to Greens, or to restaurants?

00:45:19.490 --> 00:45:21.810
You come to them and say,
we have this great tofu.

00:45:21.810 --> 00:45:22.840
We want it for your restaurant?

00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:24.160
Or they reach out
to you and say,

00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:25.326
we hear you have great tofu.

00:45:25.326 --> 00:45:26.460
We want to use it.

00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:27.501
MINH TSAI: Good question.

00:45:27.501 --> 00:45:30.070
So as a company, I
will confess to you,

00:45:30.070 --> 00:45:32.730
I'm a terrible salesman.

00:45:32.730 --> 00:45:33.360
OK.

00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:35.410
I hate sales.

00:45:35.410 --> 00:45:38.420
But I'm a good teacher.

00:45:38.420 --> 00:45:41.760
So I think the success of our
business is because I care

00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:44.550
about teaching
people about tofu,

00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:47.920
and I always try to get the
bigger guys with money to be

00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:50.780
like, hey, you need to really
explain to people what the heck

00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:54.680
tofu is and how to use it and
all of that, but they don't.

00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:56.230
So Greens is the same thing.

00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:58.960
They've used tofu before us.

00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:02.830
And I basically say to them,
I'm like, how about I come in,

00:46:02.830 --> 00:46:05.860
and I teach you about tofu?

00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:11.980
And they also came to us because
we're at the farmer's markets.

00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:16.110
I can talk a little bit about
that whole career thing,

00:46:16.110 --> 00:46:17.840
if that's of interest.

00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:21.000
What happened is I
started as an investment

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.050
banker in the early '90s.

00:46:25.050 --> 00:46:30.610
And what I discovered--
I'm an immigrant kid.

00:46:30.610 --> 00:46:34.420
So I came from Vietnam,
and I came here in 1981.

00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:36.390
And I was very
fortunate to have gone

00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:39.580
on to really great
schools and all of that.

00:46:39.580 --> 00:46:41.640
So when I came out
of graduate school,

00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:44.600
I wanted to work
in the Peace Corps.

00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:47.150
I wanted to do development
work, actually.

00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:50.210
Because I was a
beneficiary of so much,

00:46:50.210 --> 00:46:53.500
like of the UN and UNHCR.

00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:55.295
But at the time, most
of the professors

00:46:55.295 --> 00:46:58.320
that I encountered in
my graduate program

00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:01.610
came from really large,
organized institutions,

00:47:01.610 --> 00:47:06.370
like the Peace Corps,
IMF, or the World Bank.

00:47:06.370 --> 00:47:08.790
This is a time way
before, like Grameen Bank

00:47:08.790 --> 00:47:11.430
and micro-financing
and community financing

00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:13.040
and community development.

00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:15.560
So most of them said,
dude, you're a young kid.

00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:16.520
You have no experience.

00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:20.020
You don't speak French, which
is the lingua required to work

00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:22.210
in those international fields.

00:47:22.210 --> 00:47:24.390
You should just go
to the Peace Corps

00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:26.730
and just volunteer
for three years.

00:47:26.730 --> 00:47:30.420
And I couldn't do that
because I had a lot of debt.

00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:31.290
So I said, OK.

00:47:31.290 --> 00:47:33.740
So how do I still do what I do?

00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:37.822
So I managed to talk my
way into investment banking

00:47:37.822 --> 00:47:39.780
because they needed a
lot of investment bankers

00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:42.620
at the time in
Asia and Hong Kong.

00:47:42.620 --> 00:47:47.480
And the projects
that they had me on

00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:50.865
was to build
telecommunications businesses.

00:47:50.865 --> 00:47:52.990
So this is the beginning
of wireless communication.

00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:59.000
And in telecommunications,
there's a universal access

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:03.450
clause that requires any
builder of telecommunication

00:48:03.450 --> 00:48:06.380
to designate a certain
percentage to people who

00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:09.210
normally cannot access it.

00:48:09.210 --> 00:48:11.710
If you live in the
countryside, there's

00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:14.080
no reason for me to
connect you because you

00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:17.920
don't bring any economic
benefits to me as a company.

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:20.220
But by law, I have to do that.

00:48:20.220 --> 00:48:23.720
And so that's the piece
that I hooked myself into

00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:25.080
in investment banking.

00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:27.900
So I did that for a
few years, and I really

00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:31.050
enjoyed it because I got to
travel all over the world

00:48:31.050 --> 00:48:31.930
building wireless.

00:48:31.930 --> 00:48:35.111
I had a brick of a
cellphone back at the time.

00:48:35.610 --> 00:48:38.260
But I really enjoyed
it and learned a lot,

00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:40.900
but it wasn't the
right culture for me.

00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:45.020
And I left investment banking
because I learned a lot.

00:48:45.020 --> 00:48:47.020
I went from one group
to another to another,

00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:51.600
like from equity to emanate
to debt and all of that.

00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:52.680
Oh, no wonder.

00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:57.390
Two minutes.

00:48:57.390 --> 00:48:59.660
You might not get to see tofu.

00:48:59.660 --> 00:49:04.690
But I learned a lot,
but I got bored as well.

00:49:04.690 --> 00:49:09.120
And so I quit
because I didn't know

00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:12.100
why my bosses were
making so much money

00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:14.630
and still working so hard.

00:49:14.630 --> 00:49:16.900
No, it's true.

00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:19.770
They wanted me to work on
Christmas, I still remember.

00:49:19.770 --> 00:49:22.520
And I said, I was like,
no, I'm going home.

00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:25.960
And they're like,
no, you have to work.

00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:27.620
So I was kind of
pissed about it.

00:49:27.620 --> 00:49:31.180
And then when I came
back and worked,

00:49:31.180 --> 00:49:33.840
I found out how much
money they made.

00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:36.470
They were making
$25 million a year,

00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:38.420
and they worked
Christmas and New Year.

00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:41.510
So there was a
discongruity to me.

00:49:41.510 --> 00:49:44.146
So I was like, whoa,
something weird.

00:49:44.146 --> 00:49:45.950
So I was like, I can't do that.

00:49:45.950 --> 00:49:49.900
If I even make $3 million,
I wouldn't even be here.

00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:54.420
So I left, and I went
to management consulting

00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:58.850
because I wanted to continue
to work in telecom and learn.

00:49:58.850 --> 00:50:02.140
So in that process
between when I

00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:06.010
started my professional
career to when I quit

00:50:06.010 --> 00:50:07.700
was about 12 years.

00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:10.430
I saw four recessions.

00:50:10.430 --> 00:50:13.340
It's like recession, three
years later, recession.

00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:17.730
It was the dot-com
boom, and then burst.

00:50:17.730 --> 00:50:20.150
So I was really
disillusioned by all of that,

00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:23.820
because as my career
was taking off,

00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:27.000
I realized that America has
is not the meritocracy that I

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:28.690
thought it would be.

00:50:28.690 --> 00:50:31.140
So that's my final
disillusionment

00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:33.480
before I started my company.

00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:34.820
I never got laid off.

00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:36.700
But every time that
happened, I saw

00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:40.550
that the people,
my colleagues, they

00:50:40.550 --> 00:50:43.770
stayed because of a lot of
politics within corporations.

00:50:43.770 --> 00:50:47.910
And I was never politically
astute from that standpoint.

00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:50.850
So in the end, I just thought,
you know, it's not fair.

00:50:50.850 --> 00:50:54.525
So I left and decided,
to the chagrin

00:50:54.525 --> 00:50:57.915
and the disappointment of so
many people-- started tofu.

00:50:59.140 --> 00:51:00.570
People really
thought I was crazy.

00:51:00.570 --> 00:51:03.040
They're like, you're
throwing away your career.

00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:04.190
What are you thinking?

00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:05.110
What is tofu?

00:51:05.110 --> 00:51:06.790
Why are you doing tofu?

00:51:06.790 --> 00:51:09.860
But in the end, I lucked out.

00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:10.920
It worked out.

00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:12.390
So I'm very lucky.

00:51:12.390 --> 00:51:15.290
And it has so much to do
with timing-- the timing

00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:17.420
at the farmer's
markets, the fact

00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:20.230
that I decided to start
at the farmer's markets

00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:22.930
was a stroke of pure luck.

00:51:22.930 --> 00:51:25.730
Because people there had
money, so they didn't mind

00:51:25.730 --> 00:51:27.800
paying for more expensive tofu.

00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:31.440
They were very
curious about food,

00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:34.690
and the farmer's
market proliferated.

00:51:34.690 --> 00:51:37.370
Today, you have about 200
farmers markets a week

00:51:37.370 --> 00:51:38.160
in the Bay Area.

00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:39.650
Did you know that?

00:51:39.650 --> 00:51:43.290
When we started out, 10 years
ago, there were like 20.

00:51:43.290 --> 00:51:46.470
So there's a tenfold
growth of farmers markets.

00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:49.010
But it's not good
for the farmers.

00:51:49.010 --> 00:51:50.680
Because now, while
it's good for you

00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:54.390
to roll out of bed to
get it anywhere you want,

00:51:54.390 --> 00:51:56.090
that farmer has to
go to 10 markets

00:51:56.090 --> 00:52:00.015
to make the sales
that he normally sold

00:52:00.015 --> 00:52:01.930
at maybe one or two markets.

00:52:01.930 --> 00:52:05.251
So it's good at it's bad.

00:52:05.251 --> 00:52:05.750
All right.

00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:09.870
Any other questions before I
make the final batch of tofu?

00:52:09.870 --> 00:52:10.420
Yes?

00:52:10.420 --> 00:52:12.440
AUDIENCE: Well, I'm
curious, because as you

00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:14.912
said, when I see Hodo
tofu on the menu here,

00:52:14.912 --> 00:52:17.540
and it's super firm and has a
different flavor from what's

00:52:17.540 --> 00:52:18.040
here.

00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:20.639
So are they selling
a different product,

00:52:20.639 --> 00:52:22.481
or are they preparing
it differently?

00:52:22.481 --> 00:52:24.886
[INAUDIBLE]

00:52:24.886 --> 00:52:27.359
MINH TSAI: I think it's
not a different product.

00:52:27.359 --> 00:52:27.900
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:29.275
MINH TSAI: It's
the same product.

00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:33.900
I don't know how
it's served here.

00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:36.690
So I can't really speak to that.

00:52:36.690 --> 00:52:43.020
But what I can say is I'm
happy to come and sort of give

00:52:43.020 --> 00:52:44.210
a talk about it.

00:52:44.210 --> 00:52:45.930
Because what
happened, I'm afraid,

00:52:45.930 --> 00:52:49.910
is people do too
much to our tofu.

00:52:52.930 --> 00:52:55.290
People think, because they
set have the mentality,

00:52:55.290 --> 00:52:58.050
I have to fry the
heck out of it.

00:52:58.050 --> 00:53:00.990
I have to flavor it a lot.

00:53:00.990 --> 00:53:04.480
But if you just cube
up our firm tofu

00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:08.940
and just lightly dress it,
whether it's hot or cold,

00:53:08.940 --> 00:53:10.630
it would do the tofu justice.

00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:16.580
Because people take our
tofu and deep-fry it.

00:53:16.580 --> 00:53:19.260
It's terrible.

00:53:19.260 --> 00:53:21.490
You have a thick
coating on the outside.

00:53:21.490 --> 00:53:23.730
AUDIENCE: Aburaage?

00:53:23.730 --> 00:53:24.900
MINH TSAI: Aburaage?

00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:26.280
Yeah.

00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:29.670
Where is that tofu thing?

00:53:29.670 --> 00:53:30.234
Oh, good.

00:53:30.234 --> 00:53:31.650
I'm going to pour
this, and then I

00:53:31.650 --> 00:53:34.788
can make my-- if you don't mind.

00:53:34.788 --> 00:53:36.330
AUDIENCE: What would you like?

00:53:36.330 --> 00:53:37.230
MINH TSAI: Just put that out.

00:53:37.230 --> 00:53:38.380
I'm going to pour this in there.

00:53:38.380 --> 00:53:38.650
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:53:38.650 --> 00:53:40.108
MINH TSAI: Sorry
to waste all that.

00:53:40.108 --> 00:53:41.560
AUDIENCE: No.

00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:43.716
MINH TSAI: You can still eat it.

00:53:43.716 --> 00:53:45.610
Oops, sorry.

00:53:45.610 --> 00:53:47.160
All right.

00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:50.635
So here is our tofu.

00:53:54.020 --> 00:53:56.820
How scientific.

00:53:56.820 --> 00:53:59.067
I'll do that up here
instead of down there.

00:53:59.067 --> 00:54:01.650
So first, I'm going to make the
exact same thing that you guys

00:54:01.650 --> 00:54:06.380
saw, which is the silken tofu.

00:54:13.030 --> 00:54:16.390
And while that's happening, I'll
set up this really nifty thing.

00:54:16.390 --> 00:54:23.710
So essentially, what I do here
is I'm breaking up the whey.

00:54:23.710 --> 00:54:26.090
It's very similar to
cheese-making, separating

00:54:26.090 --> 00:54:30.740
the whey from the curd.

00:54:30.740 --> 00:54:33.770
So this is just our cheesecloth.

00:54:33.770 --> 00:54:37.560
I wet it because it's easier
to fold when it's wet.

00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:39.970
That's always a trick
question I ask people.

00:54:39.970 --> 00:54:41.725
Why do you think
I need to wet it?

00:54:41.725 --> 00:54:44.500
It's just easier to manipulate.

00:54:44.500 --> 00:54:49.540
So very quickly, as you can
see, I have somewhat of a silken

00:54:49.540 --> 00:54:51.180
tofu already.

00:54:56.010 --> 00:54:58.970
And then this is
the part where it's

00:54:58.970 --> 00:55:01.530
a heartbreak for everybody.

00:55:01.530 --> 00:55:03.485
Now, I started breaking it up.

00:55:03.485 --> 00:55:03.985
You see?

00:55:03.985 --> 00:55:04.943
I didn't do a good job.

00:55:04.943 --> 00:55:10.020
You see how it's not very
creamy here when I rushed it?

00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:13.190
This is what the
first guy discovered.

00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:16.540
It's kind of like
these little chunks.

00:55:16.540 --> 00:55:18.510
So it's not fully silken.

00:55:18.510 --> 00:55:24.530
So that means, as I use this,
I'm wasting some of the cream

00:55:24.530 --> 00:55:27.040
or the milk remain.

00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:31.680
So now, I basically will
scoop these chunks in here.

00:55:35.420 --> 00:55:43.055
And then I would press all
of this into a block of tofu.

00:55:43.055 --> 00:55:45.840
AUDIENCE: When you press it,
are you pressing out water?

00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:47.570
MINH TSAI: Exactly.

00:55:47.570 --> 00:55:49.340
In this case, I will
actually press out

00:55:49.340 --> 00:55:52.215
some of the remaining
proteins as well.

00:55:52.215 --> 00:55:54.598
AUDIENCE: And what
makes it cling together?

00:55:54.598 --> 00:55:58.484
It comes out as a solid
block, but it's going in as--

00:55:58.484 --> 00:55:59.900
MINH TSAI: You
mean, what makes it

00:55:59.900 --> 00:56:01.744
cling together here, or here?

00:56:01.744 --> 00:56:02.910
AUDIENCE: When you press it?

00:56:02.910 --> 00:56:03.990
Yeah.

00:56:03.990 --> 00:56:04.900
It's going to come
out solid, right?

00:56:04.900 --> 00:56:05.691
MINH TSAI: Exactly.

00:56:05.691 --> 00:56:07.290
The reason that
it comes out solid

00:56:07.290 --> 00:56:09.280
still is because,
as you can see,

00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:10.960
I'm doing this when
this is still hot.

00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:11.820
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:56:11.820 --> 00:56:15.350
MINH TSAI: So if I use that
silken tofu there and I

00:56:15.350 --> 00:56:19.580
try to form this, it wouldn't
work, because that heat.

00:56:19.580 --> 00:56:23.090
It's almost like a
second coagulation.

00:56:23.090 --> 00:56:24.250
That's what it is.

00:56:24.250 --> 00:56:29.600
And if you can do
it, basically, you

00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:36.072
have to do it soon after
the the silken tofu is made,

00:56:36.072 --> 00:56:41.295
otherwise it won't form again.

00:56:41.295 --> 00:56:44.094
AUDIENCE: So your thickener
is the calcium sulfate?

00:56:44.094 --> 00:56:44.760
MINH TSAI: Yeah.

00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:45.660
It's calcium sulfate.

00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:47.770
AUDIENCE: Is there any other
thickener that you can use?

00:56:47.770 --> 00:56:48.561
MINH TSAI: You can.

00:56:48.561 --> 00:56:50.740
As I mentioned
earlier, like, nigari,

00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:52.120
which is magnesium chloride.

00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:55.210
It's another coagulant.

00:56:55.210 --> 00:56:57.270
AUDIENCE: What about like
lemon juice or vinegar?

00:56:57.270 --> 00:56:58.750
MINH TSAI: Any
acidity will work.

00:56:58.750 --> 00:56:59.010
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:56:59.010 --> 00:57:00.676
MINH TSAI: But it's
also going to change

00:57:00.676 --> 00:57:01.697
the flavor of your tofu.

00:57:01.697 --> 00:57:02.280
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:57:02.280 --> 00:57:02.947
MINH TSAI: Yeah.

00:57:02.947 --> 00:57:05.363
AUDIENCE: In this case, this
has got absolutely no flavor.

00:57:05.363 --> 00:57:06.550
That's why you're using it.

00:57:06.550 --> 00:57:07.030
MINH TSAI: Right.

00:57:07.030 --> 00:57:07.460
Exactly.

00:57:07.460 --> 00:57:10.001
AUDIENCE: As I'm watching this,
comparing your process to how

00:57:10.001 --> 00:57:10.912
we make [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:10.912 --> 00:57:12.120
MINH TSAI: It's very similar.

00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:13.533
AUDIENCE: I'm
drawing similarities,

00:57:13.533 --> 00:57:14.475
that's why I'm asking.

00:57:14.475 --> 00:57:14.946
MINH TSAI: Yes.

00:57:14.946 --> 00:57:16.487
AUDIENCE: Is that
because the protein

00:57:16.487 --> 00:57:20.000
has a different texture when
you use calcium sulfate?

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.338
[INAUDIBLE].

00:57:22.338 --> 00:57:22.921
MINH TSAI: No.

00:57:22.921 --> 00:57:25.025
You use calcium sulfate
to make the new-- no.

00:57:25.025 --> 00:57:25.525
Yeah.

00:57:25.525 --> 00:57:26.420
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:26.420 --> 00:57:27.128
MINH TSAI: Right.

00:57:27.128 --> 00:57:30.750
So basically, because
the milk has protein--

00:57:30.750 --> 00:57:34.180
now, I haven't tasted your
panir, but I'm curious,

00:57:34.180 --> 00:57:35.290
what is the flavor?

00:57:35.290 --> 00:57:39.800
Does it still retain some of
the acidity of the lemon juice?

00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:40.812
A little bit, right?

00:57:40.812 --> 00:57:41.853
AUDIENCE: When I make it.

00:57:41.853 --> 00:57:43.272
I mean for the amount we use.

00:57:43.272 --> 00:57:46.224
We use about almost
200 pounds at a time,

00:57:46.224 --> 00:57:48.715
so it's impossible to make it.

00:57:48.715 --> 00:57:49.214
I'll get it.

00:57:49.214 --> 00:57:53.490
I source it when I do make it
I do make it for small batches.

00:57:53.490 --> 00:57:56.080
MINH TSAI: You can
definitely make tofu.

00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:59.220
You can actually make
tofu using lemon juice.

00:57:59.220 --> 00:57:59.762
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:57:59.762 --> 00:58:00.428
MINH TSAI: Yeah.

00:58:00.428 --> 00:58:03.236
So actually, if you want to keep
this and play around with it--

00:58:03.236 --> 00:58:03.860
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:58:03.860 --> 00:58:04.860
MINH TSAI: Yeah, please.

00:58:09.030 --> 00:58:10.150
No, I'm always happy.

00:58:10.150 --> 00:58:13.170
So then I just basically fold
it into a nice little block.

00:58:16.930 --> 00:58:19.410
When we have our tofu
class, this is what we do.

00:58:19.410 --> 00:58:20.790
We let you do this yourself.

00:58:22.718 --> 00:58:24.650
AUDIENCE: Where
do you get these?

00:58:24.650 --> 00:58:26.233
MINH TSAI: You can
buy them on Amazon.

00:58:30.346 --> 00:58:35.300
So let me put it in there
and see what happens.

00:58:35.300 --> 00:58:37.710
Sorry, guys, no tofu for you.

00:58:37.710 --> 00:58:38.984
MINH TSAI: Oh, man.

00:58:38.984 --> 00:58:40.150
MINH TSAI: This should work.

00:58:40.150 --> 00:58:44.820
Sometimes, when you add water,
you can still make tofu.

00:58:44.820 --> 00:58:46.660
Forget the block here.

00:58:46.660 --> 00:58:49.770
This is why we innovate.

00:58:49.770 --> 00:58:52.200
We have a round ball of tofu.

00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:53.700
AUDIENCE: That's
how you make panir.

00:58:53.700 --> 00:58:54.940
MINH TSAI: That's
how you make panir.

00:58:54.940 --> 00:58:55.735
Yeah.

00:58:55.735 --> 00:58:57.200
It's going to be like cheese.

00:58:57.200 --> 00:58:58.184
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:58:58.184 --> 00:58:59.170
Spin it.

00:58:59.170 --> 00:59:01.680
MINH TSAI: There you go.

00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:04.555
So yeah, that water.

00:59:04.555 --> 00:59:06.130
Oh, I guess I poured
water in there.

00:59:06.130 --> 00:59:11.220
But essentially, this
is still pretty hot.

00:59:11.220 --> 00:59:20.770
But the clearer the water
after the silken tofu is made,

00:59:20.770 --> 00:59:25.290
the more perfect the
coagulation is, the gelling.

00:59:25.290 --> 00:59:27.730
So let me do this.

00:59:27.730 --> 00:59:28.720
It's too hot.

00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:29.710
There we go.

00:59:32.084 --> 00:59:33.917
AUDIENCE: If you add
something like an acid,

00:59:33.917 --> 00:59:37.630
like lemon juice, what is
the need for salt as well?

00:59:37.630 --> 00:59:40.020
MINH TSAI: You don't need salt.

00:59:40.020 --> 00:59:43.070
So my earlier explanation
is he probably added salt,

00:59:43.070 --> 00:59:47.730
and it didn't do anything
flavor-wise or texture-wise.

00:59:47.730 --> 00:59:49.106
But when he added the--

00:59:49.106 --> 00:59:49.960
AUDIENCE: Vinegar.

00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:52.610
MINH TSAI: The vinegar, that's
when it becomes-- I'm so glad.

00:59:52.610 --> 00:59:55.920
I did not know that you use
lemon juice to make panir.

00:59:55.920 --> 00:59:57.500
Is that universal?

00:59:57.500 --> 01:00:00.060
AUDIENCE: I mean, that's most
of the recipes that I've used,

01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:02.780
and I'm just curious to see what
would happen if I used calcium

01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:04.995
sulfate to make panir.

01:00:04.995 --> 01:00:06.370
MINH TSAI: You
can still make it.

01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:14.730
You probably won't taste that
sourness of the panir itself.

01:00:14.730 --> 01:00:16.939
AUDIENCE: Have you ever
tried flavoring the soy milk?

01:00:16.939 --> 01:00:17.730
MINH TSAI: We have.

01:00:17.730 --> 01:00:19.300
I was telling these
guys that we used

01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:22.820
to have what we called savory
tofu, where, in this process,

01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:24.150
I actually add flavor.

01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:26.570
AUDIENCE: So as you're
boiling it, you also--

01:00:26.570 --> 01:00:28.639
MINH TSAI: It's not
the milk, but in there.

01:00:28.639 --> 01:00:29.430
AUDIENCE: In there?

01:00:29.430 --> 01:00:30.096
MINH TSAI: Yeah.

01:00:30.096 --> 01:00:34.250
I cannot do it in the
milk, because if I change

01:00:34.250 --> 01:00:38.960
the chemistry of it too much,
it won't reconstitute the second

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:39.490
time.

01:00:39.490 --> 01:00:43.270
In other words, if I manipulate
that flavor too much,

01:00:43.270 --> 01:00:44.990
I won't be able to
get a tofu block.

01:00:44.990 --> 01:00:45.720
AUDIENCE: Hmm.

01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:47.178
MINH TSAI: So that's
the challenge.

01:00:50.467 --> 01:00:51.217
AUDIENCE: So you--

01:00:51.217 --> 01:00:52.050
AUDIENCE: Oh, sorry.

01:00:52.050 --> 01:00:52.571
Go for it.

01:00:52.571 --> 01:00:54.362
AUDIENCE: You had
mentioned how you thought

01:00:54.362 --> 01:00:57.190
you would be able to make
a tofu that was almost

01:00:57.190 --> 01:00:59.490
indistinguishable from panir.

01:00:59.490 --> 01:01:02.010
I was wondering what
sort of techniques

01:01:02.010 --> 01:01:07.150
you can use to change, like, the
texture and flavor of the tofu.

01:01:07.150 --> 01:01:08.120
What are our--

01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:10.780
MINH TSAI: Actually, the
texture of panir and tofu,

01:01:10.780 --> 01:01:13.180
the difference is one is
slightly more elastic.

01:01:13.180 --> 01:01:17.200
The panir is more crumbly--
not too much more.

01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:25.200
So there's the flavoring
challenge and then

01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:26.840
the texture challenge.

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:31.690
I think the texture
challenge can

01:01:31.690 --> 01:01:36.660
be overcome if I use
a different coagulant

01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:38.190
and I add some salt to it.

01:01:38.190 --> 01:01:41.200
Then it would be
slightly more brittle.

01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:47.220
Flavor-wise, unless you
can remove the soy flavor,

01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:48.480
it will stay there.

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:51.990
However, the reason
that panir tastes

01:01:51.990 --> 01:01:56.990
so good, for me at least, is how
rich it is, how creamy it is,

01:01:56.990 --> 01:01:58.914
and because of the milk.

01:01:58.914 --> 01:01:59.580
AUDIENCE: Right.

01:01:59.580 --> 01:02:04.220
MINH TSAI: So I would have to
use a really thick soy milk

01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:09.440
to do panir, and that thick soy
milk will have enough protein.

01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:11.920
And I would also try
to find a soybean that

01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:14.017
actually has high fat.

01:02:14.017 --> 01:02:15.450
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:02:15.450 --> 01:02:19.160
MINH TSAI: Because not
all soybeans are equal.

01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:22.670
So if I find a high-fat
soybean, high protein,

01:02:22.670 --> 01:02:27.550
and I also would basically use
it-- make a thick soy milk.

01:02:27.550 --> 01:02:30.130
Then I'm closer in
terms of the ability

01:02:30.130 --> 01:02:35.210
to flavor it similar to the
flavor, similar to panir.

01:02:35.210 --> 01:02:38.110
And then I would
start with that,

01:02:38.110 --> 01:02:40.135
and then I would basically
work on the texture.

01:02:41.551 --> 01:02:43.800
AUDIENCE: Well, we don't
want to have a brittle panir.

01:02:44.764 --> 01:02:45.430
MINH TSAI: What?

01:02:45.430 --> 01:02:47.195
AUDIENCE: We don't
like a brittle panir

01:02:47.195 --> 01:02:49.512
because what we use--

01:02:49.512 --> 01:02:50.220
MINH TSAI: Right.

01:02:50.220 --> 01:02:50.720
Right.

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:51.880
Right.

01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:52.980
Yeah, it'd be fun.

01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:56.130
I'd love to come down and play
around with you, if you want.

01:02:56.130 --> 01:02:58.544
We can configure our time.

01:02:58.544 --> 01:02:59.460
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:01.610
MINH TSAI: Don't you guys have
some kind of food research

01:03:01.610 --> 01:03:02.290
institute here?

01:03:02.290 --> 01:03:04.810
You have all kinds
of institutes here.

01:03:04.810 --> 01:03:05.465
Right?

01:03:05.465 --> 01:03:06.090
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:03:06.090 --> 01:03:08.327
It starts off at 3 o'clock
when my staff leaves.

01:03:08.327 --> 01:03:08.910
MINH TSAI: OK.

01:03:11.930 --> 01:03:12.910
There you go.

01:03:12.910 --> 01:03:13.970
That will work.

01:03:13.970 --> 01:03:14.691
You know?

01:03:14.691 --> 01:03:15.190
So--

01:03:15.190 --> 01:03:16.890
AUDIENCE: Let's go
play in [INAUDIBLE].

01:03:20.406 --> 01:03:21.780
MINH TSAI: But
here, you have it.

01:03:21.780 --> 01:03:24.220
And you guys can
taste it, if you want.

01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:27.276
It's just very
different, but what

01:03:27.276 --> 01:03:32.180
I have here is a nice block
a cottage cheese-like tofu.

01:03:32.180 --> 01:03:33.575
Look at that.

01:03:33.575 --> 01:03:34.387
AUDIENCE: Oh, wow.

01:03:34.387 --> 01:03:34.970
AUDIENCE: Wow.

01:03:34.970 --> 01:03:35.817
MINH TSAI: Yeah.

01:03:35.817 --> 01:03:36.400
AUDIENCE: Wow.

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:37.326
AUDIENCE: Whoa.

01:03:37.326 --> 01:03:39.266
AUDIENCE: It actually
has the string.

01:03:39.266 --> 01:03:40.140
MINH TSAI: The cloth.

01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:40.640
Yeah.

01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:42.076
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:03:42.076 --> 01:03:43.346
AUDIENCE: That's awesome.

01:03:43.346 --> 01:03:44.012
MINH TSAI: Yeah.

01:03:44.012 --> 01:03:45.360
Go ahead and try it.

01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:46.770
Just take a spoon and dig in.

01:03:46.770 --> 01:03:47.702
AUDIENCE: All right.

01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:52.300
MINH TSAI: This is-- yeah.

01:03:54.330 --> 01:03:57.450
Now, if you salt the soy milk,
it's harder to coagulate.

01:03:57.450 --> 01:04:00.940
You have to salt it after
the second constitution.

01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:04.550
In other words, you make
them-- you make the silken.

01:04:04.550 --> 01:04:07.080
You break it up,
then you add salt.

01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:07.777
And then--

01:04:07.777 --> 01:04:08.264
AUDIENCE: Really?

01:04:08.264 --> 01:04:08.930
MINH TSAI: Yeah.

01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:13.305
That's good.

01:04:13.305 --> 01:04:13.930
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:04:13.930 --> 01:04:14.721
That's really good.

01:04:14.721 --> 01:04:17.470
MINH TSAI: There's a
really amazing article.

01:04:17.470 --> 01:04:21.630
I think it was written in
1980 in "The New Yorker,"

01:04:21.630 --> 01:04:23.502
maybe even older.

01:04:23.502 --> 01:04:25.386
But you can probably google it.

01:04:27.330 --> 01:04:29.200
It's about this
journalist who went

01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:32.090
to Japan to learn about tofu.

01:04:32.090 --> 01:04:33.930
It's a really
well-written article.

01:04:33.930 --> 01:04:37.470
And how it ended
was the tofu master

01:04:37.470 --> 01:04:43.270
invited her to his mountain
retreat for the weekend.

01:04:43.270 --> 01:04:51.290
And she went, and she discovered
that he was a wine connoisseur.

01:04:51.290 --> 01:04:54.740
And he went to his
cave, and he brought out

01:04:54.740 --> 01:05:00.262
a bottle of really expensive
Burgundy white wine.

01:05:00.262 --> 01:05:01.095
And she was shocked.

01:05:01.095 --> 01:05:02.920
It was like $1,000 bottle.

01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:06.830
And she's like, we don't have
anything to go with this.

01:05:06.830 --> 01:05:09.130
And he said, yes, we do.

01:05:09.130 --> 01:05:13.200
And apparently, he served
her some aged tofu.

01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:15.700
So I think he's dead.

01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:19.440
Otherwise, I would visit him.

01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:20.300
Thanks, guys.

01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:21.500
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:25.150
[APPLAUSE]
