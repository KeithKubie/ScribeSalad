Crash Course Philosophy
is brought to you by Squarespace.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.020
Squarespace: share your passion with the world.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:12.540
I’m Hank Green, and you and I are about
to embark on a journey.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.760
A journey of inquiry, into the whole world.
Your world.

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:19.800
In an effort to figure out: what gives it
meaning, what makes it beautiful, where its

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.420
evils come from, and ultimately, what is the
very nature of reality itself.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.640
And along the way, we’re going to question
every aspect of your own personal life -- why

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.199
you do what you do, why you think what you
think, why you feel what you feel.

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:36.499
Now, if you’ve joined me on Crash Course
before, you might say, we’ve learned about

00:00:36.499 --> 00:00:40.229
all that stuff before -- in psychology, and
biology, and anatomy and physiology.

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:44.500
And it’s true: Science can definitely help
us understand our thoughts, feelings, and actions.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.860
But on this particular journey, we’re going to be
exploring aspects of the human condition that can’t

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.959
be explained only by hormones or neurotransmitters,
by personal experiences or hereditary conditions.

00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:58.489
Because, all of those chemicals and experiences
that make us who we are, can actually raise

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:00.350
as many questions as they answer.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.170
Like, if all of my decisions really are just
the result of, say, how I was raised, and

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.830
what chemicals I have flowing in my brain,
then are any of my choices actually free?

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.299
And if I’m not truly free to make my own
decisions, or choose my own actions, then

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:15.090
how can I be held accountable for them?

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.869
Yeah. It’s going to be that kind of journey.

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:20.669
Rather than just looking at the world and
describing what we see, we’ll be evaluating it.

00:01:20.669 --> 00:01:25.340
We will take nothing as a given, set our assumptions
aside -- or at least, try really hard to -- and

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.079
do our best to see the world as if we’ve
never seen it before.

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:31.520
And for what it’s worth, we’ll also be
talking about Batman, and what Dick Grayson

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.420
can teach us about the concept of identity.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.220
And we’ll learn how The Matrix can you help
understand the life and writing of Rene Descartes.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.000
Also we’ll try to answer unanswerable questions,
and puzzle over paradoxes that have plagued

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:43.780
geniuses for thousands of years.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.909
It’s going to be hard, and enlightening,
and frustrating, and if I do my job properly,

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.429
it’ll stick with you long after you and
I have parted ways. Because:

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:53.609
We are going to do…philosophy!

00:01:53.609 --> 00:02:03.900
[Theme Music]

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.619
These days, people use the word “philosophy”
to describe some opinion they might have,

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.600
or the approach they take to a certain topic.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.860
Like, you might have a “philosophy” when
it comes to golf. Though...I personally do not.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.560
But we’re going to use this word more narrowly,
to describe a way of approaching the world

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.709
that traces its roots back to ancient Greece,
500 years before the Common Era.

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.650
This was a time of great intellectual movement
around the world. Buddhism and Jainism were

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.629
developing in Asia, at the same time philosophical
thought was emerging in Greece.

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:33.250
There, scholars were tangled up in a distinction
they were just beginning to make -- between

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.400
philos and mythos – or what we’d now roughly
call science and storytelling.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.239
At that time, there were bards, like Homer,
who were trying to understand and explain

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:44.620
the world through stories, while the earliest
philosophers were using methods that were

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.100
more analytical and scientific -- although they
didn’t really have the concept of “science” back then.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.620
So philosophia – literally "the love of wisdom" –
was a new way of trying to make sense of the world.

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:58.469
When the earliest philosophers used the word
“philosophy,” they basically meant, “the

00:02:58.469 --> 00:02:59.960
academic study of anything.”

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.099
Which, like, I guess could include golf.

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:06.150
But at what we might call the first universities
in the western world – Plato’s Academy,

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.769
and its rival, Aristotle’s Lyceum — math,
biology, physics, poetry, political science,

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.429
and astronomy were all considered to be philosophy.

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:17.420
Eventually, scholars began thinking of these
fields differently -- as separate disciplines.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.840
Studies that had strong empirical elements came
to be considered science -- a search for answers.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.240
But philosophy came to be understood more
as a way of thinking about questions. Big questions.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.540
And today, twenty-five hundred years after
the ancient Greeks first brought them up,

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.920
philosophers still love asking questions
-- oftentimes, the same questions --

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.680
and they don’t mind that they never get an answer.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:43.040
So. What are these big questions that have managed
to intrigue -- and stump -- philosophers for so long?

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.629
One of the first might best be phrased as:
What is the world like?

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:50.149
Sounds simple enough to answer, right
Like, just look around! See all the stuff?

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:51.800
Well, this is what the world is like.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.450
But the philosophical approach isn’t just
based on observation -- it has other, much

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.920
more complex questions packed inside it.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:03.079
When a philosopher wonders what the world is like,
she might really be asking: What’s the nature of reality?

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:07.179
Like, is the world just made up of matter
and energy, or is there something else going on?

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.540
And if it is just matter and energy, then
where did it all come from? Is there a God?

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.400
And if so, what is he, she, or it like?

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:16.940
And for that matter, when you’re asking
about the world, can you also be asking about

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.100
the nature of yourself, as a citizen of the world.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.030
So…what kind of being am I?

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.350
Do I have a soul? Is there something immaterial
about me that will survive after I die?

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.260
All of these questions are ways of exploring
what philosophers call metaphysics -- one

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.080
of the three main branches of philosophy -- an
effort to understand the fundamental nature

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.660
of the world, of the universe, and of being.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.200
Now, if those questions aren’t heady enough
for you, we, as students of philosophy, also

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:47.820
have a whole separate set of questions, that are
about how we know the answers to any of this stuff.

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:53.100
This particular strain of philosophy, which
is like knowing about knowing, is epistemology

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.770
-- literally the study of knowledge -- the
second major field of philosophy.

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.820
And it poses questions like: Is the world
really what I think it is?

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.600
Like, really, is everything I see and think
and experience…is it actually…true?

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:11.100
If it isn’t, then, what is true? And what’s the best way to
go about figuring out the truth? Is science the best way?

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.640
Or are there more ethereal paths to Truth,
paths that science can never really travel?

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.690
And let’s say that, after a lot of searching
and question-asking, I begin to develop some

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.410
ideas -- an inkling about what might be true.

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:26.870
Then…how do I know if I’m right? How will
I ever know I’m wrong?

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.080
Can I ever be certain about anything?!

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.980
Now, at this point I wouldn’t blame you
if you’re thinking: “Am I real?” “Do

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:38.060
I...do I know anything?” Well, as questions go,
these might not seem super…practical.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.680
But there’s another area of philosophy that
helps frame your thinking around what you

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:46.080
actually do -- like, how you should act, and
what you should attach meaning to.

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.620
It’s called Value Theory. And it’s usually divided
into two main branches. The first is Ethics.

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.340
You’ve heard of it -- it’s the thing that
politicians are always said to lack? And Jedi

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.780
are supposed to have in great supply?
Though, don’t get me started on the prequels.

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:01.360
In philosophy, though, ethics isn’t just
a code of what’s right and what’s wrong.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.030
It’s the study of how humans should live
with each other.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:08.720
Rather than just sitting around and judging people,
ethics involves posing questions like: How should I live?

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.160
Is there any reason that I should treat, say,
strangers differently than the people I love?

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:17.750
And for that matter, do I owe anything to
myself? What about animals? Or the earth?

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:21.830
And if I do have any of these obligations
at all, where do they come from? Who says?

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:26.610
Ultimately, whatever system you use to decide
what’s good or evil, as human behavior goes,

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:30.800
is determined by your values -- that’s why
ethics is considered part of Value Theory.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.140
But the other part of value theory isn’t
about what’s right -- it’s about what’s beautiful.

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.360
Aesthetics is the study of beauty, and art.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:42.740
Now, the concept of beauty is talked about practically
everywhere, from the media, to art school to barber college.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:48.600
But for philosophers, the pursuit of aesthetics involves
considering what beauty is, and whether it even exists.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:53.240
Aesthetics is a part of value theory, because
beauty, and art, are things we value, and

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:57.990
evaluate. And many people who study this particular
kind of philosophy -- known as aestheticians

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:03.020
-- believe there is such as thing as The Beautiful
-- something that doesn’t depend on what

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:06.920
you happen to find attractive, but something
that’s just objectively true.

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.700
And finally, there’s one more aspect of
philosophy that I should mention, because

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:14.370
it doesn’t ask questions, so much as help us
find answers. Yes, finally, some answers!

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:18.400
And that thing, which I happen to think can
be beautiful in its own way, is logic.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:23.620
Logic is the philosopher’s toolbox. It contains
the saws and hammers, the microscopes and

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:28.980
beakers, that philosophers use to go about
answering their questions in a clear, systematic way.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:33.980
Logic is about reasoning, giving strong arguments
that don’t fall victim to fallacies, which

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:37.660
are, as you’ll learn, the mortal enemies
of philosophical precision.

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:43.520
Ok, so metaphysics, epistemology, value theory
-- they might all seem pretty airy and abstract.

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:47.400
But don’t worry, because you have already done
philosophy, even though you might not realize it.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.760
You do it in almost every aspect of your life.

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:53.740
Every time you argue with your parents, or
wonder if you should date someone, or decide

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:57.770
to eat a salad instead of a ham ‘n’ cheese
Hot Pocket, you are doing philosophy.

00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:01.460
Because you’re thinking about the world,
and your place in it. You’re figuring out

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:04.840
what you value, why you value it, and what
you should do about it.

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:08.300
So here’s our plan. We’re going to learn
about the major fields of philosophy, posing

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:14.120
questions and considering possible answers along
the way. And each time, we will use a two-step method.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.950
First, we’ll really try to understand.

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:19.900
You’re not going to agree with all of the
ideas that I present to you – and I won’t

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:24.370
agree with them either! That’s not the point.
The point, in step one, is to really try to

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:28.390
get inside of an idea – to understand it
as charitably as possible.

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:34.000
Then, in step two, you’ll subject your understanding
to some serious critical evaluation – basically,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.680
you’ll try to knock down what you think
you know about a particular view of the world.

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:41.480
And you’ll do this whether you agree with
the view or not.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:45.980
Why? Because: Only when you challenge your
understanding of how some people view the

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:49.430
world, can you decide for yourself if theirs
is a view worth having.

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:53.339
Which leads me to my final point: Philosophy
is not your usual field of study.

00:08:53.339 --> 00:08:57.539
I’m not going to be teaching you a body of knowledge
where success means you know a bunch of stuff.

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:00.500
Success, in this course, will mean that you
know how to think.

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:05.260
All we have are questions. And all you have
is a brain. And the goal of philosophy is

00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:08.759
for you to use your brain to come up with
the answers that make the most sense to you.

00:09:08.759 --> 00:09:13.419
You’ll learn how to formulate arguments to support your
ideas, so you can explain why you think you’re right.

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:17.180
Which, if you’ve ever been on the Internet, you
know is something that not a lot of people are good at.

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:20.399
In order to do that, you’re going to need
to understand philosophical reasoning – the

00:09:20.399 --> 00:09:25.259
tools we use to investigate life’s most
perplexing questions! And that is where we’re

00:09:25.259 --> 00:09:26.889
gonna be headed the next time we meet.

00:09:26.889 --> 00:09:30.449
For now you’ve learned about the historical
origins of philosophy in ancient Greece, and

00:09:30.449 --> 00:09:35.720
its three main divisions: metaphysics, epistemology,
and value theory. We also talked about logic,

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:41.339
and how you’re going to use it to understand and
critically evaluate a whole host of different worldviews.

00:09:41.339 --> 00:09:43.539
But not about golf.
