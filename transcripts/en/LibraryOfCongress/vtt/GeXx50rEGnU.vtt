&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.440


00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:08.476
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.876
My name is Rachel Hartigan
Shea editor

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.676
of the Washington Post Book World.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:14.693
The Washington Post is very
proud to be a charter sponsor

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:16.953
of the National Book
Festival and I am very pleased

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.913
to introduce the next author.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.056
Nell Irvin Painter is one

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.590
of the leading historians
in and of this country.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:28.666
She is a professor of American
history at Princeton University

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.893
where she has also served as
director of Princeton's program

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.386
in African-American studies.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:37.160
She's written seven books
including Sojourner Truth,

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.200
Standing at Armageddon which is
a history of the progressive era

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.973
and The History of White People.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:45.340
In The History of White People
she argues that I quote,

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.233
"race is an idea, not a fact" and
traces the development of that idea

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.880
from classical times to the present.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.530
Not one to shy away
from a challenge,

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.290
she has arm wrestled Stephen Colbert
on TV and is currently working

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.236
on an MFA in painting at the
Rhode Island School of Design.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.250
Please join me in welcoming
Nell Irvin Painter

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:09.510
[ Applause ]

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:20.510
&gt;&gt; Hi folks.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.310
Thank you much for staying.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:24.843
Glad to see you all.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:26.820
I'm not going to read from my
book, The History of White People.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.430
I'm gonna talk about it a little bit

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.303
and then leave some
time for questions.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.513
And if you have a question,
please use the mics.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.550
So if you already have a question,
you can go to the mic now.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.160


00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.076
I often get ask why did I write
The History of White People

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.996
as if my body would stop me
from any area of inquiry.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.270
I'm a historian and I
write on what I want.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.746
I was thinking when I
started this book back

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.513
into the 20th century why are
white people called Caucasian?

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.880
Have any of you asked yourself that?

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.036
Do you know why?

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.593
No. And this was when the Russ--
well, it's still happening.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.630
The Russians and the
Chechens and Chechnyas

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.553
in the caucuses were
having tremendous struggle.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.766
So, why are White Americans
called Chechens?

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:33.980


00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.946
Well, I did find the answer.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.680
The answer took me to Germany, took
me to Germany in the 18th century.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.650
Now, the idea of race was
invented in the 18th century.

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.443
It doesn't go back to antiquity.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.006
There were not White
people in antiquity.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.373
But since so many people thought
that, I thought I should address it.

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.583
So my book actually starts
with the Greeks and the Romans

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.646
and their commentary on the
people who became Europeans.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.566
And what the Greeks and
Romans discovered were people

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.563
who lived in various ways.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.200
For the Greeks they talk
about what we call culture.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.950
And for the Romans who
ward in various ways

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.860
because the Romans were imperialist
and we're very interested

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.526
in who was a good fighter
and who could help

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.773
and who had to be vanquished.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.660
I followed this German idea into the
United States via Madame de Stael

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.283
who was a French intellectual
and Thomas Carlyle

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.850
who was a British intellectual
and Ralph Waldo Emerson.

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.130
So I spent a long time with Ralph
Waldo Emerson who was the kind

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.936
of genius of 19th century
White race theory.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:09.780


00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.380
Ralph Waldo Emerson didn't have a
great deal to say about Black people

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.000
but he had a lot to
say about White people.

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.170
Now, in the 19th century
the idea prevailed

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.470
that there were many White races.

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:26.566
So there were people who
were considered white.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.480
No one can question their whiteness.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.366
Very clearly the Irish were white.

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.610
Very clearly people
descended from English people

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.316
or Scottish people were
white or German people.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.833
But they belong to different races.

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.923
They were white but they
belong to different races.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.816
So for instance, the Irish
Catholics were thought to belong

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.863
to the Celtic race
and people descended

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.750
from English people were thought
to belong to the Saxon race.

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.023
And the Saxons were
better than the Celts.

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.950
It was not until the middle
of the 20th century which many

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.563
of us remember vividly that the
idea of one big White race came

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.923
into being in which everybody

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.043
who was white was the
same as everybody else.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.880
And it's not an accident that
that happened through politics.

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.283
It happened through the
national mobilization

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.063
of the Great Depression,
the Second World War

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.856
and the federal policies
crafted after Second World War.

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.103
So one big White race is
an idea based in politics.

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.350
My book is called The
History of White People.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.546
Let me say a few things
that it does not do.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.480
It does not talk very much
about people who are not white.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.226
There is very little about
African-Americans, Indians, Asians,

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:18.296
Latinos, people of color.

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:23.460
They do appear from time to time and
they appear very much at the end.

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.620
But it really is a book
about the construction

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.130
of the idea of White races.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.833
It's not a book in which I
get to beat up White people

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.753
for the bad things
they've done to others.

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:40.146
And when I started, sometimes
people would say to me,

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.660
are you writing it
as a Black person?

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:47.660


00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:48.103
And I would say, I would
get huffy and I would say,

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:52.770
I'm writing it as a historian.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:54.453
But I realize that what they meant,

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.253
are you going to use this
book to settle scores?

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:02.303
No. I don't settle scores.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.906
It's not about what White
people have done to others.

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:10.713
So, it's not very much
about Black people,

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:14.943
which is what we usually
think of in the United States

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:16.796
when we think about race.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:21.080
When people hear the world
race they automatically jump

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:24.406
to African-American
history to Black people.

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:26.323
This is not my book.

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:32.806
What I did learn was that race is
an idea that is used to create,

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:39.756
at worst, to create bad separation

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:43.620
and to rank people
and to stigmatize.

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:47.083
It can be used as a tool of hatred.

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:50.383
It can be used as a tool of racism.

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:54.970
Sometimes race is a source of pride.

00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:00.366
It can be a source of identity
in which people rally around

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:05.496
and find themselves together
in difficult circumstances.

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:09.693
It can be a response to
racism, racial pride.

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:14.780
But wherever the situation
occurs, race functions

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:21.843
to identify difference, to
separate, even at best it separates.

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:30.513
And it's always used loosely
but it says these are people

00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:36.510
who are permanently this
way and these are people

00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:40.723
who are permanently that way.

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:41.606
Sometimes it says these are people

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:46.426
who are permanently
like this and like that.

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:51.390
So I learned as I worked
on this book about 10 years

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:55.236
that whether the racism
question are colored

00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:00.676
or the racism question are
white, that race is a tool

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:05.076
of differentiation and separation.

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:07.780


00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:12.000
Someone asked me when I was doing
my book tour earlier this year

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:15.263
if I favored a national
debate on race.

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:19.090
Let me ask you.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.400
Let's take a vote.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:22.600
Do you think it's a good idea for us

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:26.866
to have a national
discussion about race?

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:29.683
If you think yes, put your hand up.

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:31.350


00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.146
If you think no, put your hand up.

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:37.806
If you're not sure,
put both hands up.

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:38.790
[Laughter] We got a lot of not sure.

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:44.190
Yeah. If you had asked me that
before I worked on my book,

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:44.826
I probably would have said,
yeah, it's a good idea

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:50.060
because we need to clear the air.

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:55.403
But then when I realized how
these ideas-- and race is an idea,

00:09:57.820 --> 00:09:59.686
it is not a biological fact.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.200
It is an idea.

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:06.783
&gt;&gt; As I worked on the history of
this idea, I began to change my mind

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:13.310
and I now no longer favor the
idea of the discussion of race.

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:17.966
I would much prefer
that we had a discussion

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:22.350
of the various conditions,
concerns, actions, thoughts,

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.426
opinions, wishes that we share.

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:35.563
I would much prefer that
we de-emphasize difference

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:40.176
and reemphasize likeness.

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.106
I much prefer that we work--

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:46.390
[ Applause ]

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:48.390
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:55.490
I much prefer that we think about
what holds us together so that

00:10:57.140 --> 00:11:00.740
in this moment of national
crisis we can work together.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.720
I wanna stop here with
the word together

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:09.290
and invite questions or comments.

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:11.510
[ Applause ]

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:23.840
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.440
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Professor.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:28.373
&gt;&gt; You're very welcome.

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:33.106
&gt;&gt; That was very-- that was-- one
of the ones who put their hands

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:37.736
in the air for we should
have a discussion and then I

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:46.466
like to change my answer
to what you just said.

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:53.550
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:58.083
&gt;&gt; So, I was wondering since
we were talking about it,

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:01.916
the word White people,
the word Black people

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:08.130
and I heard you use the word
African-American and I wonder

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:14.956
if we're ready to maybe
stop using that expression

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:16.770
and start using the word Black more.

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:18.673
I don't-- I wondered just
as a black person yourself--

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:22.600
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:25.666
&gt;&gt; -- if you feel like that's a
comfortable way to be labeled.

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:30.200
&gt;&gt; The book that I published before
the White book was the Black book.

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:33.523
[Laughter] It's called
Creating Black Americans:

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:37.953
African-American History and Its
Meanings, 1619 to the Present.

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:43.090
And in that book, I
did use the word black.

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:44.836
And I use it because it's
a more encompassing word

00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:50.783
and a less cumbersome
word than African-American

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:53.776
or all these other terms.

00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:58.730
The reason it really stuck out, I
remember facing a class at Princeton

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:02.966
in which there were several
students of African descent.

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:06.996
Some of them were people
whose ancestors,

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:11.893
whose African ancestors left
involuntarily in the 18th century.

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:13.086
So they were Americans
with very deep roots.

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:18.620
Others had themselves been brought
to the Untied States as children

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:21.500
or their parents were immigrants.

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:26.396
So we talked about
nomenclature and we said, well,

00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:30.756
what do you call brown colored
people of African descent

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:33.476
with deep American roots?

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:35.620
They said, oh, those
are African-Americans.

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:40.686
So what do you call brown
colored people of African descent

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.106
who came from Africa last week?

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:51.430
And they said, oh, those are
African-African-Americans.

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:56.250
[Laughter] So I'm thinking about
my book and the length of the book

00:13:57.910 --> 00:14:00.443
and the number of words
I can get there

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:06.616
and I'm thinking how long
African-African-American is

00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:11.143
in Caribbean African-Americans
and Latino African-Americans,

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:15.856
you know, so I just used Black.

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:19.270
Yes?

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:23.203
&gt;&gt; Hi. When you read
about current statements

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:27.793
by political leaders regarding
immigration and Islam and so on,

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:34.576
is there a period of American
history that seems most instructive

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:38.550
to you and what does it teach us?

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:44.073
&gt;&gt; Yeah. The current brouhaha over
immigration to my mind sounds just

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:47.796
like the period right
after the First World War

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:52.176
and this was a period of
hostility and hysteria

00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:56.116
against immigrants from Europe.

00:14:56.890 --> 00:15:00.223
And the racist as people
said were the Jewish race,

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:08.923
the Slavic race, the Italian.

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:13.823
Actually, there were
two Italian races.

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:17.956
There was the north Italian
race and south Italian race.

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:23.416
These were considered racist

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:27.703
and they actually had been
scientifically certified

00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:34.270
to be intellectually inferior.

00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:40.496
And that hysteria actually
led to a cutting off

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:44.880
of European immigration first
in 1921 and then in 1924,

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:54.093
so it sounds to me like 1919, 1920,
1921 until about the mid '20s.

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:02.210
Yes?

00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:06.943
&gt;&gt; In talking about the
development of the concept of the

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:11.180
"White race" you said this developed
largely after World War II.

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:18.606
And you said, one other things
you said that contributed to it

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:27.803
in the addition to the word itself
was national policies and I wonder

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:38.403
if you could explain a little
bit what you meant by that.

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:43.273
&gt;&gt; Certainly, national policies.

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:49.006
During the 19 teens, in the
early part of the 20th century,

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:54.840
there was not a lot of political
mobilization to get people voting,

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:03.106
and particularly not
to get immigrants

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:06.606
and the children of
immigrants voting.

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:12.700
But during the Great Depression,
as Franklin Roosevelt and his team

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:18.566
of democrats tried to get
some heft on their side,

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:22.646
they mobilized this group
of naturalized Americans

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:26.546
or their children who had
been born in the United States

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:29.790
who were of the working class.

00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:29.853
They were workers and they tended
to vote democratic when they voted.

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:34.910
So there was first a
mobilization of voters

00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:37.296
on the democratic side
during the Great Depression

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:38.850
and that made possible the new
deal and continuing the new deal.

00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:46.996
During the Second World War there
was an even greater emphasis

00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:52.460
on national unity in order to pursue
the goals of the Second World War

00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:59.163
and the Second World War
was a war against fascists

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:01.726
and Nazis and racial states.

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:06.520
And so there was a ground swell
of culture partly fostered

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:11.806
by the federal government but
largely because many Americans felt

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:13.483
that we needed to pull together.

00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:17.596
It was a kind of multiculturalism
of [inaudible] before the word.

00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:20.436
So that came out of
the Second World War.

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:23.720
And then after the Second World War,

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:28.410
there were two very important
policies that created the suburbs.

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:37.833
One was the Federal Housing
Administration which was not new

00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:42.230
but took on a very important
new role as a guarantor

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:46.766
of mortgage lending, and
the Veterans Administration.

00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:50.196
And this is the GI Bill of Rights.

00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:52.603
These were administered in
a cruelly racist fashion

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:56.470
and they underwrote the suburbs
in a way that White people

00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:00.390
of any background were able

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:06.886
to get this wonderful 30 year fixed
rate mortgages low down payment.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:14.093
And people living in mixed
neighborhood, city neighborhoods,

00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:20.540
Black neighborhoods could not.

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:22.406
Remember that it was not illegal
to discriminate in lending

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:22.673
and housing policies until 1968.

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:24.740
So the suburbs became White land.

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:27.873
People who had been part
of these many white races,

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:28.740
and the cities became Black land.

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:32.806
And then there's Malcolm X who
always talked about the White man.

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:33.940
He didn't say the south
Italian has been oppressing.

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:34.673
You know, he said the White man.

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:38.606
So the postwar era really cemented
this sense of a Black world

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:39.473
and a White world separated
by a [inaudible].

00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:41.540
Yes?

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:43.073
&gt;&gt; Hi. First of all
I do own your book.

00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:45.806
I haven't read it yet but
after this I'm going to.

00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:46.606
I wanted to address two things.

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:50.873
First of all you talked about that
when you were writing the book,

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:53.273
people were coming to you and saying
is this something that you're going

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:54.206
to use to settle a score.

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:55.340
Curious, was that audience
that came to say

00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:56.740
that to you, was it generational?

00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:00.740
Did you have older people that
were saying that, younger people,

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:02.340
or was it across the board?

00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:03.606
&gt;&gt; Older people.

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:05.406
&gt;&gt; Okay. Of whom I am
a card carrier member.

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:07.806
[Laughter] But I must say
that has changed and for

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:09.073
that I wanna thank
the American people.

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:11.540
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:13.540
[ Applause ]

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:15.873
&gt;&gt; Another question?

00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:17.140
&gt;&gt; The second question
was when you talk

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:19.140
about race being the
culmination of race

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:21.806
and the White race per se
being a political thing.

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:24.540
My question is and you kinda--

00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:26.940
just kind of dovetailing with the
gentleman before me talked about.

00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:28.940
If it was a political thing and it
was meant not only to get people

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:29.940
to vote a certain way but
was also meant to entitle.

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:31.673
If you have a situation
where that is happening,

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:33.873
what is going to encourage
people that are entitled

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:35.006
to have a conversation
about equality?

00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:37.606
&gt;&gt; I don't know.

00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:39.540
[ Pause ]

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:41.540
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:43.540
[ Laughter ]

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:45.540
&gt;&gt; Yes?

00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:48.206
&gt;&gt; Yes. I have a comment.

00:20:48.540 --> 00:21:35.480
I have two of my grandchildren are--

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.000


00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:50.606
&gt;&gt; Can you speak a little more?

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:54.073
I can't quite hear you.

00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:56.273
&gt;&gt; Two of my grandchildren
are European, Southeast Asian,

00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:58.140
Indian and African-American,
and so they aren't a race.

00:20:58.540 --> 00:20:59.873
They are not a race.

00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:01.140
And I discussed their
ethnic backgrounds

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:05.273
and I don't understand why we don't
replace the term race with ethnicity

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:05.940
because we do all have
different ethnic backgrounds.

00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:07.940
I'm German and Irish.

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:09.873
My grandchildren have like
five ethnic backgrounds,

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:11.140
and that's the current
state of America.

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:13.806
So the discussion of race
is really anachronistic.

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:15.540
Any comment?

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:18.740
&gt;&gt; The discussion of race has
never made sense except as a means

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:19.473
of ranking people, as
differentiating people.

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:22.006
And the means and the
discussion have always differed

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:24.673
so there's never been any scientific
or nonscientific agreement

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:24.740
on how many human races there are

00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:27.806
on how many White races
there are on how you tell.

00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:30.073
So in the 20th century, and
I used to have my students

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:32.140
at Princeton do this, in the
early 20th century the way

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:33.740
to tell various White
races was to measure heads.

00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:35.140
So if you had a round
head that was flat

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:37.140
in the back you were
probably an Alpine.

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:42.606
Okay. If you had a long head and
you were blond and blue eyed,

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:46.136
then you were a Teutonic.

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:48.603
And if you had a long
head and you had dark hair

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:53.363
and dark eyes you were
a Mediterranean.

00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:54.833
Any of you heard of those races?

00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:57.700
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:21:58.700 --> 00:21:59.700
&gt;&gt; Yes. Okay.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.333
But most of you I suspect have not.

00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:08.436
But those were important scientific
terms in the early 20th century.

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:12.816
So the means of differentiating
and the names and all

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:15.973
that never has there
been an agreement.

00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:20.976
It is race has always been a
figment of the cultural imagination,

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:24.693
not something in the body.

00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:29.770
And certainly as the question
you pointed out, not permanent.

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:34.556
So today we are faced
with many children.

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:39.460
In fact, some grown ups with
very complicated backgrounds.

00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:44.176
Now, in the 20th century, if you
were brown and you identify this

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:48.170
as Black or African-American
or colored,

00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:51.696
you could have all
kinds of ancestors.

00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:56.396
So most of us who say we're Black
or African-American have ancestors

00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:01.586
from three continents, from Africa,
from America and from Europe.

00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:04.243
And in fact historians say

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:08.783
that if you can trace your
American ancestry back to the middle

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:13.893
of the 19th century, you too,
no matter how you identify,

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:19.243
have ancestors from three
continents, at least, at least.

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:23.260
So we've always been mixed up.

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:27.326
Human beings have been
walking and moving

00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:31.323
since human beings
became human beings.

00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:36.646
Human beings became human beings
in Africa and started walking

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:40.946
and people have been walking
and moving and migrating

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:45.866
and I won't use the more
graphic Anglo-Saxon term for it

00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:47.736
but they've been having sex.

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:54.283
[Laughter] And they've been having
sex with lots of different people.

00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:59.566
So everybody is mixed and
this is not a new thing.

00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:03.870
You ask the question
about the word ethnicity.

00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:08.163
I hear this being substituted
from time to time for race.

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:09.486
It's seems like they're kinder,

00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:13.820
gentler word and that's
fine with me.

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:16.100
Yes?

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:20.166
&gt;&gt; Professor Painter, my
name is Olivia McDavid

00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:24.296
Blackamore [phonetic].

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:27.230
So I'm a living, walking Blackamore.

00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:28.510
And that's what I've
always called myself--

00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:30.710
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:32.110
&gt;&gt; -- more so than African-American.

00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:35.553
But we do know that the Africans
went into Europe and other countries

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:36.410
and intermingle and intermarried.

00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:39.323
Could you tell us a
little more about that

00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:43.456
and how we're connected
with the White race?

00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:44.013
&gt;&gt; Well, there is no such
thing as a White race.

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:48.080
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:49.813
&gt;&gt; There is no such
thing as a Black race.

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:51.763
Races are things that people make up
in order to differentiate you or me

00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:55.530
or somebody else from somebody else.

00:24:57.130 --> 00:24:59.930
It's a classification,
a taxonomical issue.

00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:03.380
So as people moved, some settled.

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:06.920
And when you settle
you start to change.

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:08.530
Have you ever noticed how
differently younger people sound

00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:13.443
from us when they talk?

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:16.706
And that's just change
is how people are.

00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:20.670
So it all happened one by one.

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:23.173
You have sex, one-- no.

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:24.273
I was going to say you have sex one
person at a time but then I realized

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:31.140
that you can have a lot of
sex with a lot of people.

00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:35.610
But generally you have sex with
one person at a time and what

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:40.826
that produces or the situation
under which it occurs,

00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:45.010
sex can be a loving
close bond making event

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:52.763
but it can also be a rape or
something profoundly traumatic.

00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:56.683
So sex occurs in all kinds

00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:59.550
of situations among
all kinds of people.

00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:00.966
&gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you.

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:02.980
&gt;&gt; Yes?

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:04.923
&gt;&gt; First of all Professor,
thank you for coming.

00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:07.170
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:10.103
&gt;&gt; This seems to be a common
theme but I come from this area

00:26:10.170 --> 00:26:14.503
like I think many of us come and
it's more multicultural area now,

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:18.746
and so it seems to me that the
battles of the '60s and '70s

00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:22.683
and the '80s have started to
be reflected in my children,

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:26.563
our children's generation.

00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:30.496
They seem to be much more
comfortable crossing the lines

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:31.766
with each other.

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:33.700
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:36.166
&gt;&gt; So as a historian, are
you hopeful for the future?

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:36.856
Is-- are we marching
forward as a nation?

00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:40.876
&gt;&gt; As a historian I-- no.

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:45.366
As a human being, I am hopeful.

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:46.826
I'm an optimist.

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:51.293
If I weren't an optimist, I
would have been long gone.

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:53.366
As a postmodern historian I say

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:58.073
that we don't always get
better as time goes on.

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:01.080
We don't-- progress
is not automatic,

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:01.956
so I don't know what's going
to happen in the future.

00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:08.523
However, I will say that the
taxonomy of race is breaking down.

00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:11.380
The clearest way to
see the breakdown is

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:17.026
with the classification
called Hispanic or Latino.

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:21.506
So if you see Hispanic
Latino, there's an asterisk

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:25.073
and it says Hispanic
Latinos can be of any race.

00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:27.656
And something like 6 to 10 percent

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:32.440
of Latinos answering the 2000
census checked some other race.

00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:39.043
That's a lot of people.

00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:43.220
A lot of people are some other race.

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:47.760
So we are going to
be seeing other ways.

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:53.086
For myself if I were
designing it I would ask what

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:56.933
about family wealth
and what about income?

00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:00.640
Because I think that's
where our policies need

00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:02.816
to go but I don't design it.

00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:04.350
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:05.816
&gt;&gt; We have time for
one more question.

00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:08.350
&gt;&gt; Ah, okay.

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:11.150
Which would be [inaudible]?

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:12.826
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:14.293
I live in DC, predominantly
Black city,

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:17.560
and I live in a predominantly
Black neighborhood and teach

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:18.346
at a predominantly Black college,
and so the issue of race is one

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.240
that I deal with regularly.

00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:28.116
And I just would be curious if
you had any words of suggestion

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.133
or advice for those of
us who regularly interact

00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:37.176
with other races specifically
the Black-White dynamic

00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:41.873
and you would say to young
people as well about all of that?

00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:44.216
&gt;&gt; I would say to young people of
any background as I said to all

00:28:48.170 --> 00:28:51.770
of you, let us not emphasize
difference and separation.

00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:56.763
Let us emphasize what we have
in common and work together

00:28:57.930 --> 00:29:01.596
that we don't just sit and
say I'm this and you're that.

00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:02.113
But let us figure out what it is we
wanna do and what we want to achieve

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:08.040
and how we can do it together.

00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:09.923
Thank you very much.
