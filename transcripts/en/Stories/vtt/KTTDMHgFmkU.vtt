[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:01.622 --> 00:00:03.580
NARRATOR: This photo is
a little bit confusing.

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.490
It's hard to make out
exactly what's going on here.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.410
The rope, the tiny
light, the night

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.760
sky the snail-shell
walls-- there's something

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.800
really abstract about it all.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.780
And that's probably because
it's a place and an angle

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.131
that not a lot of
people have ever seen.

00:00:19.131 --> 00:00:22.570
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.440
The photographer who's helping
us experience this new angle

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.420
is this guy.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.670
CHARLIE KESSNER: Hi, my
name is Charlie Kessner.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.640
I'm an adventurer and
professional photographer

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.010
living in southern Utah.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.830
This photo was taken
on a canyoneering trip

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.950
down Pine Creek Canyon
in Zion National Park

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.847
during the fall of 2014.

00:00:36.847 --> 00:00:39.180
This frame captures my good
friend and climbing partner,

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.970
Ian Smith, at the
top of the final wrap

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.920
of the technical portion
of Pine Creek Canyon.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.590
NARRATOR: So yes, there is a
person up there on that rope,

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.980
descending-- or repelling--
down into this canyon at night.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.010
This is canyoneering, an obscure
and technical adventure sport

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.232
with roots at the very place
Charlie took the photo.

00:00:58.232 --> 00:01:00.440
CHARLIE KESSNER: Pine Creek
is a very special canyon.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.655
Like all canyons
in the desert, it

00:01:01.655 --> 00:01:04.113
was sculpted by millions and
millions of years of waterflow

00:01:04.113 --> 00:01:05.396
and flash flood erosion.

00:01:05.396 --> 00:01:06.770
With this continual
waterflow, it

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.370
has left the most beautiful
scar in the Earth.

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.160
And actually, to the
best of my knowledge,

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.201
Pine Creek was one of the
first technical canyons

00:01:12.201 --> 00:01:14.240
descended in Zion
back in the late '70s.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.860
It's a very popular destination
for many individuals, climbers

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.310
and canyoneers alike.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.060
Unfortunately, it's also a very
popular locale for accidents,

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.892
due to attracting many
inexperienced canyoneers.

00:01:24.892 --> 00:01:26.600
NARRATOR: And the
dangers of canyoneering

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.142
go way beyond lowering yourself
down a rock face at night.

00:01:29.142 --> 00:01:31.600
CHARLIE KESSNER: I would say
that the main misunderstanding

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.060
about canyoneering is that the
only difficult or dangerous

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.851
thing is repelling.

00:01:34.851 --> 00:01:36.850
When going canyoneering,
more often than not,

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.610
one will encounter
everything from hiking,

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.225
wading, swimming, climbing--
as well as repelling.

00:01:41.225 --> 00:01:42.600
NARRATOR: But
that's exactly what

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.650
attracted Charlie to the
sport in the first place.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.710
For him, the reward far
outshines the risks.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.360
It's all about
adventure, experience,

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.967
and feeding his wanderlust.

00:01:52.967 --> 00:01:54.550
CHARLIE KESSNER:
Through canyoneering,

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.341
you get to explore one
of the most standout

00:01:56.341 --> 00:01:57.970
landscapes I've seen on planet.

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.410
In this short life
that we have, I

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.701
believe that it's important
to get out and go exploring

00:02:01.701 --> 00:02:03.104
in whatever capacity we can.

00:02:03.104 --> 00:02:05.270
It is very important to
have a routine and a place--

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.510
whether it's a truck,
van, house, or otherwise--

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:08.220
to call home.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.380
But it's the experience of
traveling away from that space

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.965
and opening yourself up
to learning new things

00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:14.920
in new environments that changes
and teaches you and ultimately

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.190
enriches your life when
you do return to your home.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.170
Whatever you're doing
and wherever you are,

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.670
I believe that you
can go exploring.
