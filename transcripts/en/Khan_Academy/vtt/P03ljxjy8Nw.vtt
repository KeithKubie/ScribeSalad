00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:02.740
Here's another interesting
word problem that was

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:04.560
sent by [? Cortagio ?].

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.720
A woman cycles to work
alongside a railroad track

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.190
at 6 kilometers per hour.

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:11.790
That's an interesting
piece of data.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.590
6 kilometers per hour.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.190
Every day she arrives
at a crossing the same

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.360
time that a train does.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.070
OK.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.120
One day she was 50 minutes
late, and was overtaken by

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.940
the train 6 kilometers
from the crossing.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.630
In how many minutes will the
train reach the crossing.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.390
Let's see if we can draw a
diagram here that can somewhat

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:35.960
describe what's going
on in this problem.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.210
So what's on a normal day?

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.780
On a normal day, she leaves
from home, she leaves from

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.060
home, and she goes and she
travels alongside

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.710
a railroad track.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.700
Not too different than my own
commute on my own bicycle.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.150
Actually, I actually do travel
on a bike path that's right

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.370
along a railroad track.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.580
Anyway, let's say she leaves
here at time is equal to 0.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.270
Time is equal to 0.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.000
And right at this point right
here, maybe that's where the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.790
railroad crossing is, right
there, the train passes her up.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.420
And she's traveling at
6 kilometers per hour.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.610
6 kilometers per hour.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.060
6 kilometers per hour.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.150
And what else does it tell us?

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.570
It doesn't tell us how
long it takes her, or

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.026
how far she travels.

00:01:22.026 --> 00:01:28.470
So let's just say she arrives
here at t is equal to a hours.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.730
t is equal to a.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.800
We'll do time in hours, since
we're in kilometers per hour.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.600
So this path takes her
a hours to travel.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.410
So it takes her a hours.

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.560
If we care about
the time, a hours.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.080
Now on this next day,
she's 50 minutes late.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.900
So on this day, she has to
travel the same distance in

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.850
time, well in both
distance and time.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.250
But this is this day.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.970
She leaves not a t equals 0.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.320
She leaves 50 minutes late.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.770
Since we're dealing with
hours, let's write

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.350
50 minutes in hours.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.500
So she leaves at-- if this was
time equal 0, that's when she

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.260
normally leaves --she's now
leaving at that time is equal

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.400
to 50 minutes, or time
is equal to 5/6 hours.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.670
Right?

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.410
50 minutes is just 50/60 hours
or 5/6 hours of time is

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.490
equal to 5 over 6 hours.

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.940
This time is equal to 0 hours.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.050
And let's see, it says that she
was overtaken by the train 6

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.550
kilometers from the crossing.

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.410
So she was overtaken by
the train some place over

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.170
here, and this distance.

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.890
Right this is where the
crossing is, that's

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.090
that crossing.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.680
This is 6 kilometers.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.530
6 kilometers.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.190
In how many minutes will the
train reach the crossing?

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.800
So if we can figure out some
way of expressing this time, if

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.410
we can figure out with this
time is, we know that the train

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.010
reaches the crossing
a t is equal to a.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.810
So if we know this time, we
can just find the difference

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.000
between these two times and we
would have solved the problem.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.940
So let's see if we can
figure out this time.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.600
So we know that it normally
takes her a hours to travel

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.280
this whole distance.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.240
It doesn't matter when she
leaves it takes her a hours.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.290
So in this case it should
also take her a hours.

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.570
And how long does she have to
go when the train passes up on

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.400
this day that she was late?

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.530
How long will it take her to
go this distance right there?

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.885
Well she's traveling at 6
kilometers per hour, she

00:03:25.885 --> 00:03:27.690
has to go 6 kilometers.

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.820
So in time, this is going
to take her 1 hour.

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.400
To get-- you know, the train
will have long passed her --but

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.220
to get back to the crossing,
she's going to have to

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.850
travel for another hour.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:43.480
So if her whole route takes her
a hours, this whole length

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.410
in time is a hours.

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.650
Then this distance right
here is going to have

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:48.810
to take her, what?

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.380
She has an hour left, her whole
trip is going to be a hours, so

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:53.970
this is going to be
a minus 1 hours.

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.280
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:02.330
This is going to take
her a minus 1 hours.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.680
So if on the day she was late
it took her a minus 1 hours to

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.500
get passed by the train, what
time are we talking

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.310
about right here?

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:11.330
What time is this?

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:17.080
This is t is equal to--
well we started at 5/6

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.380
--t is equal to 5/6.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:19.350
That's where we started.

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.040
Plus the amount of hours she
traveled plus a minus 1.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.580
So there we, I think, we now
have all the information we

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.330
need to solve this problem.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.490
On the day she is late, the
train passes or at time is

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:37.390
equal to 5/6 plus a minus 1
hours, where a is the amount of

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:39.690
time it normally takes her to
travel her entire route

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:40.660
to the crossing.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.720
We know that the train passes
this point at t is equal to a.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.550
So if we want to know how many
minutes does it take the train

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.130
to go from this point to
this point, we just have to

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.080
subtract the two times.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.990
So the minutes it takes,
well the hours because

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.890
we're doing it hours.

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:02.260
And remember I said 50 minutes
was 5/6 of an hour, so the

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:09.080
minutes it takes is a,
that a, minus this.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.050
Minus 5/6 plus a minus 1.

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.300
Right?

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.630
That's just the difference in
time for the train, in hours.

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:22.760
So this is a minus
5/6 minus a plus 1.

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.150
Luckily the a's cancel out.

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.600
a minus a, and you're left with
1 minus 5/6 hours, which is

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.060
just equal to 1/6 hours.

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.390
There are 60 minutes
in an hour, so 1/6 of

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:36.220
that is 10 minutes.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.040
So it takes the train 10
minutes to get to the

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.160
crossing from the point
that it passed her.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.260
Another neat problem, and
I thank [? Cortagio ?].

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.740
for that.

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.720
And then you can actually use
this information if you want

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.280
figure out how fast the train
is going, or you could even

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.850
think of other types of
derivative problems

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:51.580
off of this one.

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.710
Anyway, another good problem.
