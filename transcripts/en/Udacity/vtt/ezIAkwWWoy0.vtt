00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.682
So we've changed this equation that had rational expressions to an equation that

00:00:04.682 --> 00:00:08.860
contains a quadratic, x squared. Since this equation is quadratic, we want to

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.150
bring all the terms to one side of the equation, factor the expression, and then

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.660
set each factor equal to zero. So I want you to try and rearrange this equation,

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.272
so that way you can factor it. Then solve it just like you've done before. When

00:00:22.272 --> 00:00:26.506
you think you've the values of x, enter them here as a set, and be sure to

00:00:26.506 --> 00:00:28.433
separate the values by a comma.
