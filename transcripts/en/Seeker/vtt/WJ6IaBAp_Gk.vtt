00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:09.140
The ability to use a mixture of textile waste resources and convert them into building application products.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.980
Shows that there are endless possibilities.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.390
So here's an example of tile that we produce
that has got a combination of a couple of

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.840
different types of waste materials.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:26.840
And in this instance we've got glass coupled
with textiles and that just adds so much more color.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.240
We can create and reform these new mixtures
that we've created into hybrid

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.420
panels for the built environment.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:40.360
It's a whole new opportunity and a whole new
world that looks at transformation of textiles

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.860
in a completely different dimension.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.220
Considered the alchemist of waste, Veena Sahajwalla
has been exploring its hidden potential on

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.120
a molecular level.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:00.239
Where I grew up in Mumbai, it's the industrial
heartland of India. People are very creative

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.350
and they like to be able to take advantage
of every bit of material and product.

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.880
We don't appreciate enough value that is
embedded in our waste materials.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.200
That's really one of the reasons
why I'm so passionate about it.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.840
I think we can do so much more and create
so much more value out of waste.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.240
As an engineer and materials scientist, she’s
built a career rerouting the world’s most

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.740
problematic waste streams.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.659
She’s invented green steel, a technique
that uses shredded rubber tires to make the

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.500
iron needed for steel.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.920
She’s also spun up an electronic waste microfactory
to tackle that mountain of waste, using modular

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.300
systems to capture micromaterials from discarded
cell phones.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.759
And now, she’s turning her attention to
textiles.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.780
Because it’s gotten way too easy to buy
new clothes these days.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.780
There’s a constant flood of new items at
your fingertips and it’s all part of a speed

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.500
up that’s happening in the fashion industry.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.409
The tonnage of waste, the numbers are simply
mind boggling. We're talking about many,

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.619
many millions of tons of waste materials.

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:09.690
Some of the world’s largest clothing manufacturers
produce as many as 900 million items per year.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.820
And so we’re buying more clothes at lower
quality, using them for shorter periods of

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.650
time, and then throwing them away.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.800
And that disposal loop is becoming a huge
problem.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.560
If you’re in the United States, roughly ten times more clothes are going into landfills today

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.450
than in the 1960s.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.739
But Veena thinks there’s potential here,
even with those discarded 7 dollar shirts.

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:37.310
A lot of the materials that go into manufacturing
our garments are indeed synthetic materials.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.709
So just because they don't continue their
life as a garment because they've fallen

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:48.220
apart doesn't mean that the fundamental fibers
that are there in these garments are no longer useful.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.480
What is really fascinating is when you actually zoom in

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.480
and look at it at a deeper level

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.400
you can indeed look at it, as a collection
of molecules.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.480
That in fact presents so many different opportunities.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.099
With that kind of thinking, Veena and her
team invented a method that captures the molecular

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:10.840
properties from discarded items and turns
them into building panels.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.299
When our garments come to us, there's more
than just the textile in our clothes.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.820
We have, for example, zippers and buttons.

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:23.790
The start of the journey for us has been about removing some of these other products so that we can focus

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:32.650
in and look at textile itself. Then literally
zoom down and break it down into those microfibrils.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:38.040
Not all waste textiles deliver high level
performance.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.930
And this is why we've got to be very selective
in understanding what kind of properties we

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.860
want. You know what are the different types of chemical
reactions that would occur if these different

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.920
mixtures were to react with each other.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.200
Once they’ve got the textiles sorted, they’ll
incorporate recycled glass and wood into the

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.840
mix to create an optimum blend.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.540
That then gives us the ability to use them
as structural products.

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:09.940
And that strength can in fact be derived from
waste wood and can be derived from waste glass.

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:15.170
So in fact, suddenly a mixture is not a bad
thing for recycling and reforming.

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.660
It could well be a really, really good thing.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.940
That then becomes, in fact, the starting point for
the process,

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.620
which requires us to apply heat and pressure.

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.760
We have to have our fleece materials located
inside the mold.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:36.690
And that hot press really allows us to apply
the heat and pressure that's required to ultimately

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.600
create the finished product.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:44.780
The product then cools down, it forms into
that nice integrated structure that's been

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:50.170
bonded together and then it's ready to be
extracted out of the press and ready to be

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.810
trialed and tested.

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.100
These building materials are piloted in Veena’s
microfactory, and the hope is that they’ll

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.470
be used as tiles and interior finishes in your home one day.

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.880
What we are doing of course, is going beyond
the traditional three r's as people know is

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.560
reduce, reuse, recycle.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.810
We can actually go beyond traditional recycling
and think about a fourth r, that we like to

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:22.690
call reform, which means that we can really
reform the structure, we can reform that chemistry.

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.850
No matter how many technologies we develop.

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:29.140
I think we have to also take some responsibility
into our own hands.

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:35.640
we need to ask the question, do we really
need so many different types of clothing items?

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.760
Do we need to really go out there and purchase
the next best thing?

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.830
It's not good enough for us to think, well,
just because we've thrown away our old clothes

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.470
that we've done our bit.

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:49.910
That's really why it's so important for us
to look at our waste resources and the ability

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:56.680
to transform into different types of products.
Looking at micro recycling ultimately has

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.660
to be governed by the principles that we are
developing economies of purpose

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:06.800
bringing our materials back to life over and over again
actually then

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.540
further promotes and develops circular economy.

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:15.060
And that notion of a circular economy is a
major part of Veena’s mission.

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:19.330
Because it’s not just about making new building
materials or extracting materials from cell

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:24.500
phones, it’s about rethinking our global
supply chain altogether.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:30.890
Having small and modular systems that can
be fine tuned in terms of the operations is

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.090
what a microfactory is all about.

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:39.000
The ability to actually take locally available
waste materials like textiles and waste glass

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.580
for instance, gives us a whole range of possibilities
to create those local industries where you

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:50.020
can actually apply your creativity as well
as of course engineering strengths.

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:54.140
What that then does is allow you to create
a win-win outcome, both from an environmental

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:59.550
point of view as well as delivering economic
benefits into the local region.

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:05.280
What we are really talking about here is creating
those supply chains that make those resources

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:11.910
so valuable and so useful that really no
one wants to even think about disposal.

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:17.060
This whole journey of circular economy will
allow us to think very differently about our

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:22.180
waste resources and never think of them as
an environmental burden.
