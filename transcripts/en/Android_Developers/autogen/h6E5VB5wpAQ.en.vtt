the info those case is actually pretty

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:03.600
the info those case is actually pretty
 

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:06.530
the info those case is actually pretty
interesting because not only they show

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:06.540
interesting because not only they show
 

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:09.319
interesting because not only they show
the results of some actions that were

00:14:09.319 --> 00:14:09.329
the results of some actions that were
 

00:14:09.329 --> 00:14:11.780
the results of some actions that were
performed by the partner but they were

testing so now you will be seeing on how

00:14:16.519 --> 00:14:16.529
testing so now you will be seeing on how
 

00:14:16.529 --> 00:14:22.370
testing so now you will be seeing on how
different changes of variables bring

00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:22.380
different changes of variables bring
 

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:25.819
different changes of variables bring
different results so this case is when

00:14:25.819 --> 00:14:25.829
different results so this case is when
 

00:14:25.829 --> 00:14:28.880
different results so this case is when
additional content was added to a

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:28.890
additional content was added to a
 

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:33.079
additional content was added to a
premium chest group a is the control

00:14:33.079 --> 00:14:33.089
premium chest group a is the control
 

00:14:33.089 --> 00:14:34.850
premium chest group a is the control
group so the the content that was

00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:34.860
group so the the content that was
 

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:37.069
group so the the content that was
usually available in the game then you

00:14:37.069 --> 00:14:37.079
usually available in the game then you
 

00:14:37.079 --> 00:14:40.460
usually available in the game then you
have groups B C and D and actually what

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:40.470
have groups B C and D and actually what
 

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:42.920
have groups B C and D and actually what
you can see is that it's not the group

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:42.930
you can see is that it's not the group
 

00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:44.540
you can see is that it's not the group
that received the most of the premium

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:44.550
that received the most of the premium
 

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:47.150
that received the most of the premium
content that added the most value to the

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:47.160
content that added the most value to the
 

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:50.180
content that added the most value to the
players lifetime so this is actually one

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:50.190
players lifetime so this is actually one
 

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:52.370
players lifetime so this is actually one
of the cases where you have to balance

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:52.380
of the cases where you have to balance
 

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:55.329
of the cases where you have to balance
the content that you deliver properly

00:14:55.329 --> 00:14:55.339
the content that you deliver properly
 

00:14:55.339 --> 00:14:58.630
the content that you deliver properly
another example is a person lot of

00:14:58.630 --> 00:14:58.640
another example is a person lot of
 

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:03.410
another example is a person lot of
personalized offers before the studio

00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:03.420
personalized offers before the studio
 

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:06.139
personalized offers before the studio
had an offer that was universal for all

00:15:06.139 --> 00:15:06.149
had an offer that was universal for all
 

00:15:06.149 --> 00:15:09.439
had an offer that was universal for all
players but then they decided to include

00:15:09.439 --> 00:15:09.449
players but then they decided to include
 

00:15:09.449 --> 00:15:13.160
players but then they decided to include
the content based on the progress that

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:13.170
the content based on the progress that
 

00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:14.660
the content based on the progress that
the players have already made to the

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:14.670
the players have already made to the
 

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:17.930
the players have already made to the
game and here again we can see that the

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:17.940
game and here again we can see that the
 

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:23.240
game and here again we can see that the
mouse that our mouth has increased by

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:23.250
mouse that our mouth has increased by
 

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:25.970

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:28.650
 
another example this is the cross

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:28.660
another example this is the cross
 

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:30.439
another example this is the cross
promotional factor which I mentioned

00:15:30.439 --> 00:15:30.449

promotional factor which I mentioned
this is the installs that are being

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:33.970
this is the installs that are being
 

00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:38.489
this is the installs that are being
driven by cut the rope we all probably

00:15:38.489 --> 00:15:38.499
driven by cut the rope we all probably
 

00:15:38.499 --> 00:15:40.759

00:15:55.149 --> 00:15:57.150
you can see the different examples of
icons that were used for reaching those

00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:57.160
icons that were used for reaching those
 

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:01.019
