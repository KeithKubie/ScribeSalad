Congratulations, you've come a long
way to make it to this point.

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:04.470
By understanding structs and

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.570
protocols you were able to quickly
enhance the functionality and

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.260
organization of both the robot maze and
Pirate Fleet apps.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.840
See you in the next session.
