00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.610
BRADY HARAN: I'm in the middle
of London on Regent Street--

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.060
in case you couldn't tell with
all those red buses going by.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:06.080
We want to talk about something

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:06.980
a little bit Olympics.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.120
We're going to talk to
you about flags.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.750
There's loads of flags up the
street there, but we want to

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.250
talk about one in particular.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.329
It's one you don't often see at
the Games, because, well,

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:18.215
this country's never actually
won a medal.

00:00:18.215 --> 00:00:19.550
But their flag?

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.410
Very mathematical.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.700
DR. JAMES GRIME: We got chatting
about countries and

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.150
their flags and things.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.050
And I thought, well,
what sort of maths

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.100
could we do with that?

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.320
And we could look at the
symmetry of flags and which

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.340
has the most symmetrical flag.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.180
Then I thought, no.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.330
I know what the most
mathematical flag is.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:38.720
And this is amazing.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.960
So Nepal, I reckon, has the most
mathematical flag-- the

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.310
country of Nepal.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.300
Because the mathematical
construction for the flag is

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.810
actually written into
their constitution.

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.040
And I've got it here.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.070
This is Article 5 of the Nepal
Constitution, where it

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.710
describes how to construct
the nation's flag.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:59.900
Shall I read it to you?

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.940
Schedule 1, relating
to Article 5.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.400
National flag.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.610
A, method of making the shape
inside the border.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.890
One, on the lower portion of a
crimson cloth, draw a line AB

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.920
of the required length
from left to right.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:24.590
Two, from A draw a line AC
perpendicular to AB, making AC

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.270
equal to AB plus one third AB.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:35.250
From AC, mark off D, making a
line AD equal to line AB.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.960
Join BD.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.040
From BD, mark off E, making
BE equal to AB.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:48.830
Four, touching E, draw a line
FG starting from the point F

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.940
on line AC parallel to AB
to the right-hand side.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.740
Mark off FG equal to AB.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.330
Five, join CG.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:06.000
I believe it is the only flag
for a country, certainly, that

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.610
isn't a square or a rectangle.

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.580
It makes it very unusual that
Nepal are bucking the trend.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.640
They're sticking with it.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.490
This is their flag.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:14.630
And they're sticking with it.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:20.150
From AB, mark off AH, making
AH equal to one

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.380
fourth of line AB.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.610
And starting from H, draw a line
HI parallel to line AC,

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.130
touching line CG at point I. If
it was on cloth, we could

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.120
just fold it in half and
mark it, you see?

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.264
So maybe I'll do that
with the paper.

00:02:38.264 --> 00:02:41.630
So I want to draw half
this distance.

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:49.980
Bisect CF at J and draw a line
JK parallel to AB, touching CG

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.240
at point K. It is not necessary
to have to measure

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.350
with your ruler.

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.370
You can follow these
instructions without any

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.350
measuring at all.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.050
It's telling you to divide
things by half and quarters

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.180
and thirds.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.620
And using those rules, without
measuring, we should be able

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.520
to do this.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:14.630
Let L be the point where lines
JK and HI cut one another.

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.440
Nine, join JG.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.370
10, let M be the point
where line JG

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.960
and HI cut one another.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.790
With center M and with a
distance shortest from M to

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.280
BD, mark off--

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.900
I can't keep a straight face.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:31.640
OK.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.280
With center M and with a
distance shortest from M to

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.390
BD, mark off N to the lower
portion of line HI.

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:46.780
Touching M and starting from O,
a point on AC, draw a line

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.480
from left to right
parallel to AB.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:55.740
With center L and radius LN,
draw a semicircle on the lower

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.830
portion and let P and Q be the
points where it touches the

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.990
line OM respectively.

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:09.310
With center M and radius MQ,
draw a semicircle on the lower

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:16.560
portion touching P and Q. With
center N and radius NM, draw

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:23.790
an arc touching PNQ at
R and S. Join RS.

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:28.970
Let T be the point where RS
and HI cut one another.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:36.380
16, with center T and radius TS,
draw a semicircle on the

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:41.120
upper portion of PNQ, touching
it at two points.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:46.230
This is what mathematics was
like in ancient times.

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:47.640
This is what it was like
to the Greeks.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.350
All Greek mathematics
was like this and

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:51.560
written down like this.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:56.550
With center T and radius TM,
draw an arc on the upper

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.451
portion of PNQ, touching
at two points.

00:05:00.451 --> 00:05:04.016
Eight equal and similar
triangles of the moon are to

00:05:04.016 --> 00:05:08.050
be made in the space lying
inside the semicircle of

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:14.530
number 16 and outside the arc of
number 17 of this schedule.

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:15.450
I made that bit up.

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.230
(WHISPERING) I cheated
there a little bit.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:18.220
Just a little bit.

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.060
C, method of making the sun.

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:27.430
Bisect line AF at U and draw a
line UV parallel to line AB,

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.162
touching line BE at V.
I've gone blind.

00:05:31.162 --> 00:05:34.070
Oh, it's all swimming now.

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.600
OK.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:39.480
With center W, the point where
HI and UV cut one another, and

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.100
radius MN draw a circle.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.990
Got to W. There isn't
any X and Z, so yes,

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.050
we're nearly there.

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:48.950
It took that many
letters, though.

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:51.300
It took nearly the
whole alphabet.

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.660
Just be glad there
aren't 27 steps.

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:54.840
What we would have done then.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:59.100
With center W and radius
LN, draw a circle.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:03.820
12 equal and similar triangles
of the sun are to be made in

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:08.090
the space enclosed by the
circles of number 20 and of

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:12.280
number 21 and with the two
apexes of two triangles

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.130
touching line HI.

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:16.800
D, method of making
the border.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.940
The width of the border will be
equal to the width of TN.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.990
This will be of deep blue color
and will be provided on

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:26.780
all sides of the flag.

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:31.110
However, on the five angles of
the flag, the external angles

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:33.850
will be equal to the
internal angles.

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:35.150
Explanation--

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:41.450
the lines HI, RS, FE, ED, JG,
OQ, JK, UV are imaginary.

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:45.060
Similarly, the external and
internal circles of the sun

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:47.540
and the other arcs, except
the crescent

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.150
moon, are also imaginary.

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.720
These are not shown
on the flag.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.180
And it's as easy as it sounds.
