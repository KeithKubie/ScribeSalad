00:00:00.075 --> 00:00:01.108
- [Voiceover] So,
grammarians, we have this

00:00:01.108 --> 00:00:04.081
class of words called adjectives,

00:00:04.081 --> 00:00:06.820
and what they do is they change stuff.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.443
Adjectives...

00:00:10.292 --> 00:00:12.751
change stuff.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.007
Adjectives change stuff.

00:00:16.007 --> 00:00:18.538
They're part of this
larger category of words

00:00:18.538 --> 00:00:21.606
that we call modifiers.

00:00:23.031 --> 00:00:24.941
Because that's what they do, they modify,

00:00:24.941 --> 00:00:26.410
they change things.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.413
So let's say I were to draw you a bear,

00:00:28.413 --> 00:00:31.640
a kinda human-looking,
standing on two legs

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.243
kinda bear, sure.

00:00:35.243 --> 00:00:39.488
I could refer to this bear
and I could say, the bear.

00:00:40.667 --> 00:00:42.374
But I could also refer to this bear

00:00:42.374 --> 00:00:47.374
with a description,
like, the friendly bear.

00:00:49.236 --> 00:00:51.767
But if that bear were blue, for instance,

00:00:51.767 --> 00:00:56.658
I could describe the
bear as the blue bear.

00:00:57.639 --> 00:01:02.639
And in the blue bear the
word blue modifies bear.

00:01:02.945 --> 00:01:06.950
Blue is an adjective that describes bear.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.950
So adjectives change stuff
and they describe stuff.

00:01:16.226 --> 00:01:18.351
And if that bear were a
different color it would be,

00:01:18.351 --> 00:01:21.624
you know, the red bear.

00:01:24.082 --> 00:01:26.326
And now that bear is red.

00:01:26.326 --> 00:01:29.507
Actually more of a salmon color, frankly.

00:01:29.507 --> 00:01:32.885
Let's put this into action
with some sentences.

00:01:32.885 --> 00:01:37.458
Steven is Connie's best friend.

00:01:37.458 --> 00:01:40.409
Now what is the word that describes

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.542
or changes another word in this sentence?

00:01:44.542 --> 00:01:46.829
If you guessed best, you were correct.

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.232
Best modifies friend.

00:01:49.232 --> 00:01:51.159
So Steven is Connie's best friend.

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:52.750
What is Steven? A friend.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.100
What kind of friend is he?

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.643
The best friend.

00:01:56.643 --> 00:02:00.336
The enormous pie is not for sale.

00:02:01.588 --> 00:02:06.034
Now what's the adjective in that sentence?

00:02:06.034 --> 00:02:08.286
If you guessed enormous
you would be correct.

00:02:08.286 --> 00:02:10.365
Enormous, which means very big,

00:02:10.365 --> 00:02:13.592
is modifying or changing the word pie.

00:02:13.592 --> 00:02:15.636
And I thought a little bit of word origins

00:02:15.636 --> 00:02:17.888
might be kind of useful here if we go

00:02:17.888 --> 00:02:19.026
back to the Latin.

00:02:19.026 --> 00:02:20.428
Now you don't, obviously you don't need to

00:02:20.428 --> 00:02:23.082
speak Latin in order to
make sense of English,

00:02:23.082 --> 00:02:25.462
but I thought it would
be cool to look at what

00:02:25.462 --> 00:02:27.865
adjective literally means.

00:02:27.865 --> 00:02:30.884
The word part, ad-, comes from the Latin

00:02:30.884 --> 00:02:35.423
meaning to or toward or on.

00:02:35.423 --> 00:02:40.423
And the -jective part comes
from a Latin word, jacere.

00:02:40.694 --> 00:02:43.799
It means to throw.

00:02:45.781 --> 00:02:48.567
So, an adjective is
something that's kind of

00:02:48.567 --> 00:02:51.748
thrown on or thrown on top of something,

00:02:51.748 --> 00:02:54.035
because you don't necessarily need

00:02:54.035 --> 00:02:58.285
adjectives in order for
a sentence to make sense

00:02:58.285 --> 00:02:59.597
the way that you need to have a verb

00:02:59.597 --> 00:03:02.242
or the way that you need to have a noun.

00:03:02.242 --> 00:03:04.196
Adjectives are a little bit extra,

00:03:04.196 --> 00:03:07.319
they're thrown on top.

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:08.773
These sentences would work on their own

00:03:08.773 --> 00:03:09.992
without the adjectives in them.

00:03:09.992 --> 00:03:11.629
Steven is Connie's friend.

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:13.301
The pie is not for sale.

00:03:13.301 --> 00:03:15.217
You know, they would work.

00:03:15.217 --> 00:03:18.392
But what's nice about adjectives,

00:03:18.392 --> 00:03:20.517
and modifiers of all
kinds, is that they add

00:03:20.517 --> 00:03:23.629
something extra, they add more detail.

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:26.566
They change and describe stuff.

00:03:26.566 --> 00:03:28.412
That's what adjectives do.

00:03:28.412 --> 00:03:29.759
You can learn anything.

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:31.232
David out.
