00:00:00.897 --> 00:00:04.147
(computer mouse click)

00:00:05.349 --> 00:00:07.849
(piano music)

00:00:09.477 --> 00:00:12.377
- [Voiceover] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:12.377 --> 00:00:14.710
Bipedal, naked, large brain,

00:00:17.424 --> 00:00:21.666
long the master of fire,
tools, and language,

00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:25.876
but still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:25.876 --> 00:00:30.626
Aware that death is inevitable,
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.783 --> 00:00:36.283
We grow up slowly, we hand down knowledge,

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:39.632
we empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.986 --> 00:00:42.209
We shape the future from our

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:44.959
shared understanding of the past.

00:00:46.436 --> 00:00:50.176
CARTA brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.176 --> 00:00:54.759
to exchange insights on who
we are and how we got here.

00:00:56.328 --> 00:00:57.999
An exploration made possible

00:00:57.999 --> 00:01:01.082
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:22.084 --> 00:01:25.084
(synthesizer music)

00:01:27.466 --> 00:01:30.049
(upbeat music)

00:01:41.647 --> 00:01:44.149
- The world loves meat.

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:46.451
Each one of us in the U.S. eats about

00:01:46.451 --> 00:01:48.784
200 pounds of meat per year,

00:01:49.745 --> 00:01:52.182
which makes us one of the top

00:01:52.182 --> 00:01:54.807
meat consuming countries in the world

00:01:54.807 --> 00:01:57.855
and it's more than twice
the global average.

00:01:57.855 --> 00:02:00.437
So we are a nation of meat eaters

00:02:00.437 --> 00:02:03.038
living in a world of meat eaters

00:02:03.038 --> 00:02:06.226
and global meat
consumption is on the rise.

00:02:06.226 --> 00:02:08.739
But the question is, are we, as a species,

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:12.404
inherently vegetarian or carnivorous?

00:02:12.404 --> 00:02:15.501
The answer is that we are both.

00:02:15.501 --> 00:02:18.345
Our species evolved to
consume an ommniverous diet

00:02:18.345 --> 00:02:21.793
that contains both plant
and animal products.

00:02:21.793 --> 00:02:25.314
But today, I'll be giving
you a very brief history

00:02:25.314 --> 00:02:28.046
of our species' relationship with meat

00:02:28.046 --> 00:02:31.424
and I have been tasked
with the job to outline

00:02:31.424 --> 00:02:35.883
the nutritional benefits
and costs of eating meat.

00:02:35.883 --> 00:02:37.663
Man the hunter.

00:02:37.663 --> 00:02:40.944
The statement is a
catchphrase of our species.

00:02:40.944 --> 00:02:43.347
It conjures bold images
that have dominated

00:02:43.347 --> 00:02:46.284
academic discourse, the media,

00:02:46.284 --> 00:02:48.624
and public opinion for decades.

00:02:48.624 --> 00:02:52.000
Here, a popular artist named
Banksy plays with this idea

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.891
in his piece The Trolley Hunters.

00:02:54.891 --> 00:02:57.353
And I urge you to do a
search for man the hunter

00:02:57.353 --> 00:03:01.581
on the internet and view the
type of images that pop up.

00:03:01.581 --> 00:03:04.087
There are tens of millions of images

00:03:04.087 --> 00:03:06.654
and most of them are a
variation on a theme,

00:03:06.654 --> 00:03:08.913
as you might imagine.

00:03:08.913 --> 00:03:11.059
The individual images and their content

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:12.975
are not what's important.

00:03:12.975 --> 00:03:15.581
It's the underlying take-home message.

00:03:15.581 --> 00:03:19.248
And that message is
that meat made us human.

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:23.303
For well over a century,
anthropologists have touted

00:03:23.303 --> 00:03:26.680
meat consumption as the
catalyst for critical watershed

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.027
moments in our evolutionary past.

00:03:29.027 --> 00:03:32.514
Things like pair bonding,
family formation,

00:03:32.514 --> 00:03:36.764
neural expansion, toolmaking,
and even cooperation.

00:03:40.044 --> 00:03:42.750
While the specific role that
meat might have played in the

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.147
evolution of human behavior is debated,

00:03:45.147 --> 00:03:47.313
one thing is certain.

00:03:47.313 --> 00:03:49.588
Meat did change the playing field

00:03:49.588 --> 00:03:51.838
for our earliest ancestors.

00:03:53.167 --> 00:03:55.631
So our history with meat
goes back quite far in our

00:03:55.631 --> 00:04:00.631
evolutionary past and how far
back continues to be debated.

00:04:00.908 --> 00:04:02.557
The image you see here dates to

00:04:02.557 --> 00:04:05.128
approximately 20,000 years ago.

00:04:05.128 --> 00:04:08.483
This artwork is found on
the caves in Lascaux, France

00:04:08.483 --> 00:04:12.110
and by the time that the artists
were painting these images,

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.628
it's possible, and likely,
that early members of our genus

00:04:16.628 --> 00:04:21.628
had already been eating
meat for millions of years.

00:04:21.711 --> 00:04:23.342
Hunters living in the paleolithic

00:04:23.342 --> 00:04:25.700
did not eat only muscle tissue.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.481
Much like contemporary foragers today,

00:04:28.481 --> 00:04:31.174
they consumed all of the animal.

00:04:31.174 --> 00:04:33.311
All edible portions of the carcass.

00:04:33.311 --> 00:04:36.896
Which would have included
organs, bone marrow,

00:04:36.896 --> 00:04:39.990
and even, in some instances,
the GI tract of the animal,

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.110
which is a practice called gastrophagy.

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.227
They would've targeted
game animals initially

00:04:45.227 --> 00:04:48.716
using stone tools with some
early, though controversial,

00:04:48.716 --> 00:04:50.951
dates putting the first
stone tools in Kenya

00:04:50.951 --> 00:04:53.034
at 3.3 million years ago.

00:04:54.132 --> 00:04:58.322
Hafted, or stone-tipped,
spears came on the scene later

00:04:58.322 --> 00:05:00.588
with some finds in the
archeological record

00:05:00.588 --> 00:05:04.389
dating to around 500,000
years ago in South Africa.

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:06.532
Bow and arrow technology later still,

00:05:06.532 --> 00:05:09.871
possibly around 70,000 years ago.

00:05:09.871 --> 00:05:12.076
The important point here is that

00:05:12.076 --> 00:05:16.423
different complex technologies
were created, modified,

00:05:16.423 --> 00:05:20.482
and used to target animal
protein, going very far back

00:05:20.482 --> 00:05:22.982
in human evolutionary history.

00:05:26.507 --> 00:05:29.288
So the question of when is
a bit tricky to pin down

00:05:29.288 --> 00:05:32.155
and is something that we'll
be talking about today.

00:05:32.155 --> 00:05:34.727
The question of why our
ancestors turned to meat

00:05:34.727 --> 00:05:37.711
is slightly less contested.

00:05:37.711 --> 00:05:40.363
This is a photo of women in the
population with whom I work,

00:05:40.363 --> 00:05:44.064
the Hadza foragers at Tanzania,
who live in east Africa

00:05:44.064 --> 00:05:46.933
and very rarely do we see or associate

00:05:46.933 --> 00:05:49.933
women with big game hunting.

00:05:49.933 --> 00:05:51.471
And so I like to show this photo

00:05:51.471 --> 00:05:54.525
because it highlights the
often very cooperative form

00:05:54.525 --> 00:05:57.677
that hunting in human
populations can take.

00:05:57.677 --> 00:06:00.173
And on this day, a man
killed a cape buffalo

00:06:00.173 --> 00:06:03.273
and there was so much meat
that all hands were needed

00:06:03.273 --> 00:06:05.729
on deck to transport this meat

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:08.560
from the butchery site back to the camp.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.437
And I was also conscripted to help.

00:06:10.437 --> 00:06:12.619
I am not on camera, I'm taking the photo,

00:06:12.619 --> 00:06:15.851
and I'm useless and I was
useless that day as well

00:06:15.851 --> 00:06:19.594
so my portion had to be
carried in a backpack.

00:06:19.594 --> 00:06:22.829
It was humiliating, but it was helpful

00:06:22.829 --> 00:06:26.458
and I'm not very efficient at
carrying anything on my head

00:06:26.458 --> 00:06:27.867
so the backpack worked for the day

00:06:27.867 --> 00:06:29.732
but when I said all hands on deck,

00:06:29.732 --> 00:06:31.899
I meant all hands on deck.

00:06:33.177 --> 00:06:37.010
So this begs the question,
why all the effort?

00:06:38.188 --> 00:06:40.152
Meat is a concentrated nutrient source

00:06:40.152 --> 00:06:43.420
that is easy to digest,
depending on preparation,

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:45.690
which we will talk about later today also.

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:48.754
It's high in protein, niacin,

00:06:48.754 --> 00:06:51.831
essential micronutrients
like B-complex vitamins,

00:06:51.831 --> 00:06:52.998
iron, and fat.

00:06:54.182 --> 00:06:57.143
It has three major types
of fats: trans-fatty acids,

00:06:57.143 --> 00:07:01.223
cholesterol, and triglycerides
that are comprised mostly

00:07:01.223 --> 00:07:05.275
of saturated fatty acids,
monounsaturated fatty acids,

00:07:05.275 --> 00:07:10.011
and polyunsaturated fatty acids,
which we often call PUFAs.

00:07:10.011 --> 00:07:12.733
Two essential fatty
acids found in meat are

00:07:12.733 --> 00:07:15.472
linoleic acid, which is an omega-6,

00:07:15.472 --> 00:07:19.149
and alpha-linolenic acid,
which is an omega-3.

00:07:19.149 --> 00:07:23.386
These cannot be synthesized
by humans and so we need them.

00:07:23.386 --> 00:07:25.133
They are important for
brain growth and function

00:07:25.133 --> 00:07:28.152
so we must consume them in our diet.

00:07:28.152 --> 00:07:30.059
Additional important omega-3 PUFAs

00:07:30.059 --> 00:07:33.072
that are found in red meat
include docosahexaenoic acid,

00:07:33.072 --> 00:07:36.572
or DHA, and eicosapentaenoic acid, or EPA.

00:07:37.643 --> 00:07:39.541
These are essential during
pregnancy and lactation

00:07:39.541 --> 00:07:40.974
and have also been shown to reduce

00:07:40.974 --> 00:07:43.807
the risk of some chronic diseases.

00:07:45.067 --> 00:07:46.525
Red meat also plays a role in

00:07:46.525 --> 00:07:49.779
preventing iron deficiency, or anemia.

00:07:49.779 --> 00:07:51.794
And around the world, iron
is one the most commonly

00:07:51.794 --> 00:07:56.096
deficient nutrients and this
might be linked to the fact

00:07:56.096 --> 00:07:58.976
that it has low bioavailability,

00:07:58.976 --> 00:08:01.943
which can be defined as
the ease and speed at which

00:08:01.943 --> 00:08:04.816
a nutrient, like iron, makes its way

00:08:04.816 --> 00:08:08.601
from the food that we
eat to the target tissue.

00:08:08.601 --> 00:08:11.177
There are two different
types of dietary iron,

00:08:11.177 --> 00:08:13.274
as you might have
interpreted from this slide,

00:08:13.274 --> 00:08:15.191
heme and non-heme iron.

00:08:16.199 --> 00:08:18.725
Non-heme iron is found
in both plant foods and

00:08:18.725 --> 00:08:21.157
animal tissues and this type of iron

00:08:21.157 --> 00:08:25.865
is poorly absorbed and
has low bioavailability.

00:08:25.865 --> 00:08:28.685
Heme iron, on the other
hand, comes from hemoglobin

00:08:28.685 --> 00:08:30.886
and myoglobin that's found in animals

00:08:30.886 --> 00:08:34.670
and this type of iron
is very bioavailable.

00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:38.822
For example, while it only
contributes to a modest 10-15%

00:08:38.822 --> 00:08:42.293
of total dietary intake in
the diet of red meat eaters,

00:08:42.293 --> 00:08:47.126
it accounts for more than
40% of total absorbed iron.

00:08:49.161 --> 00:08:51.604
So heme iron is also known
to increase the absorption

00:08:51.604 --> 00:08:54.050
of non-heme iron, which
means that meat really

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:58.464
is the best source of
iron that we can consume.

00:08:58.464 --> 00:09:01.505
It's important, as delays
in global brain function

00:09:01.505 --> 00:09:03.325
and motor function have been associated

00:09:03.325 --> 00:09:05.742
with chronic iron deficiency.

00:09:06.875 --> 00:09:09.520
Heme is also involved in
the distinction between red

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:12.532
and white meat, which is largely based

00:09:12.532 --> 00:09:15.094
on the myoglobin content.

00:09:15.094 --> 00:09:19.297
Myoglobin is the heme iron that
contains pigmented proteins,

00:09:19.297 --> 00:09:21.236
which make the meat red in color

00:09:21.236 --> 00:09:25.102
so the more myoglobin,
the redder the meat.

00:09:25.102 --> 00:09:27.958
Beef has far more myoglobin
when compared to chicken,

00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.839
which is considered a white meat,

00:09:29.839 --> 00:09:32.794
and if you are used to
classifying pork as a white meat,

00:09:32.794 --> 00:09:35.714
you're probably likely to do
so based on a very successful

00:09:35.714 --> 00:09:38.883
advertising campaign from the late 1980s.

00:09:38.883 --> 00:09:41.639
The slogan, Pork. The Other
White Meat, was created

00:09:41.639 --> 00:09:45.354
for the National Pork Board
in order to boost sales

00:09:45.354 --> 00:09:48.334
to compete with chicken and turkey,

00:09:48.334 --> 00:09:50.638
and the campaign was very effective.

00:09:50.638 --> 00:09:53.756
So although pork is typically
classified as a white meat

00:09:53.756 --> 00:09:57.342
in culinary contexts, it is
most certainly a red meat

00:09:57.342 --> 00:10:00.325
when it comes to its
nutritional composition.

00:10:00.325 --> 00:10:03.264
And this is important,
because red meat has certain

00:10:03.264 --> 00:10:05.772
characteristics that white meat does not

00:10:05.772 --> 00:10:07.035
and these are often associated

00:10:07.035 --> 00:10:09.735
with negative health outcomes.

00:10:09.735 --> 00:10:13.560
Associations reported with
colorectal cancer and other

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:17.196
carcinomas, atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease,

00:10:17.196 --> 00:10:18.790
type 2 diabetes, and potentially

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:21.873
other inflammatory processes as well.

00:10:24.511 --> 00:10:27.327
There are many proposed
explanations for these disease

00:10:27.327 --> 00:10:31.827
associations, such as saturated
fat, high salt intake,

00:10:33.221 --> 00:10:34.567
and environmental pollutants that

00:10:34.567 --> 00:10:37.081
may be contaminating red meat.

00:10:37.081 --> 00:10:39.484
Another mechanistic
explanation is the metabolic

00:10:39.484 --> 00:10:44.484
incorporation of a non-human
sialic acid called Neu5Gc.

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.334
And much of this groundbreaking
work is being done

00:10:46.334 --> 00:10:48.714
right here at UCSD at the medical school

00:10:48.714 --> 00:10:50.984
in Ajit Varki's lab.

00:10:50.984 --> 00:10:53.505
Sialic acids are a
family of monosaccharides

00:10:53.505 --> 00:10:55.908
that are widely distributed
in animal tissues

00:10:55.908 --> 00:10:59.426
and, to a lesser extent, other organisms.

00:10:59.426 --> 00:11:03.115
And they're located at the
very distal end of sugar chains

00:11:03.115 --> 00:11:06.622
that are connected to the
surfaces of cells and proteins.

00:11:06.622 --> 00:11:09.442
We lost the enzyme synthesizing Neu5Gc

00:11:09.442 --> 00:11:12.025
in our evolutionary
past, yet trace amounts

00:11:12.025 --> 00:11:13.994
are still found in humans.

00:11:13.994 --> 00:11:17.355
So even though it's a foreign
molecule to the human body,

00:11:17.355 --> 00:11:19.178
we incorporate small amounts

00:11:19.178 --> 00:11:22.110
from the red meat that we consume.

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:26.134
Red meat contains very
high amounts of Neu5Gc.

00:11:26.134 --> 00:11:29.734
I did a postdoc in Ajit's lab
and played a very small role

00:11:29.734 --> 00:11:32.479
in a very large project that
attempted to quantify the

00:11:32.479 --> 00:11:35.531
amount of Neu5Gc in
commonly consumed foods

00:11:35.531 --> 00:11:40.031
in the human diet and Neu5Gc
is in all animal products

00:11:41.092 --> 00:11:42.743
so anything associated with red meat,

00:11:42.743 --> 00:11:45.343
which would include
dairy products as well,

00:11:45.343 --> 00:11:48.397
eating red meat, or the
products of red meat,

00:11:48.397 --> 00:11:50.290
allows for the metabolic incorporation

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:53.382
of this Neu5Gc into human tissues.

00:11:53.382 --> 00:11:56.720
So the immune system recognizes
it as a foreign threat

00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:00.340
and then produces
antibodies to counter it.

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:02.795
So repeated consumption
of red meat can cause

00:12:02.795 --> 00:12:05.119
chronic inflammation,
which has been known to

00:12:05.119 --> 00:12:07.935
increase risks of tumor formation.

00:12:07.935 --> 00:12:10.624
Neu5Gc has been linked
to cancer as well as

00:12:10.624 --> 00:12:13.623
cardiovascular and other
inflammatory diseases.

00:12:13.623 --> 00:12:15.811
And all available evidence supports this,

00:12:15.811 --> 00:12:17.721
including studies that
have been done with mice,

00:12:17.721 --> 00:12:20.054
with humanized sialic acids.

00:12:21.715 --> 00:12:23.781
So despite these disease risks,

00:12:23.781 --> 00:12:27.398
red meat consumption around
the world is on the rise.

00:12:27.398 --> 00:12:29.929
As much of the world is protein deficient,

00:12:29.929 --> 00:12:32.262
red meat is a good source of protein

00:12:32.262 --> 00:12:33.928
and not only protein but also iron,

00:12:33.928 --> 00:12:36.018
which we've talked about.

00:12:36.018 --> 00:12:38.584
So perhaps the solution
then, according to many

00:12:38.584 --> 00:12:41.661
nutritionists, is just to eat less meat.

00:12:41.661 --> 00:12:44.215
The American Institute for
Cancer Research recommends

00:12:44.215 --> 00:12:45.257
that we don't eat more than about

00:12:45.257 --> 00:12:47.840
18 ounces of red meat per week.

00:12:49.451 --> 00:12:53.076
If the world does continue
its upward trajectory however,

00:12:53.076 --> 00:12:55.709
how will we feed an
expected global population

00:12:55.709 --> 00:12:57.626
of 9.7 billion by 2050?

00:13:00.463 --> 00:13:02.384
According to the Food and
Agriculture Organization

00:13:02.384 --> 00:13:05.749
of the United Nations,
about 60% of the world's

00:13:05.749 --> 00:13:08.671
ice-free land surface is
currently dedicated to raising

00:13:08.671 --> 00:13:10.767
crops and providing grazing land

00:13:10.767 --> 00:13:12.909
for the animals that we eat.

00:13:12.909 --> 00:13:16.136
So this is supporting
around 360 million cattle

00:13:16.136 --> 00:13:18.803
and 600 million sheep and goats.

00:13:19.968 --> 00:13:22.371
About 788 million acres are used

00:13:22.371 --> 00:13:25.022
almost exclusively for livestock.

00:13:25.022 --> 00:13:28.447
A recent census of agriculture
by the USDA estimates

00:13:28.447 --> 00:13:32.070
that this totals up to about
40% of all of the tillable land

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:35.374
in the U.S. and many food scientists argue

00:13:35.374 --> 00:13:39.676
that this level of
production is unsustainable.

00:13:39.676 --> 00:13:42.222
So sustainable alternative
feeds for cattle are now being

00:13:42.222 --> 00:13:46.717
introduced like microalgae,
sugar cane, or brewers grains,

00:13:46.717 --> 00:13:49.286
which are the solid residue
that are the product

00:13:49.286 --> 00:13:54.286
of germinated and dried cereal
grains used to make beer.

00:13:54.325 --> 00:13:55.978
Diets are also switching to alfalfa,

00:13:55.978 --> 00:13:59.470
which reduces methane emissions in cattle.

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:01.610
So in addition to coming up
with more sustainable feed

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:03.991
for livestock, people are
trying to come up with ways

00:14:03.991 --> 00:14:07.964
to make the entire food
system more sustainable.

00:14:07.964 --> 00:14:10.461
And some estimates suggest
that in order to produce

00:14:10.461 --> 00:14:14.360
one billion kilograms of beef
today, we're only using about

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:18.328
88% of the water that we did in 1970

00:14:18.328 --> 00:14:22.661
and only about, approximately,
67% of the land.

00:14:24.137 --> 00:14:26.535
In addition to coming up with
this more sustainable feed

00:14:26.535 --> 00:14:29.469
for livestock, people are
trying to come up with ways

00:14:29.469 --> 00:14:32.344
to just make the entire
system more efficient

00:14:32.344 --> 00:14:36.584
and this effort extends to
reducing waste outputs as well.

00:14:36.584 --> 00:14:39.310
So the amount of manure, for
example, has been reduced

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:44.233
by 18% compared to 1977,
and in addition, the overall

00:14:44.233 --> 00:14:48.671
carbon footprint per billion
kilos of beef produced in 2017

00:14:48.671 --> 00:14:51.155
was reduced by over 16% compared to

00:14:51.155 --> 00:14:55.044
the same footprint from the late 1970s.

00:14:55.044 --> 00:14:56.772
But while they might be down,

00:14:56.772 --> 00:15:00.497
livestock still contribute
to greenhouse gas emissions.

00:15:00.497 --> 00:15:04.271
As of last year in 2017, the
FAO estimated that, globally,

00:15:04.271 --> 00:15:09.124
livestock contributes to about
14.5% of all anthropogenic,

00:15:09.124 --> 00:15:11.970
or man-made, greenhouse gas emissions

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:15.424
due to enteric fermentation and manure.

00:15:15.424 --> 00:15:17.815
Some estimates suggest that
emissions may be similar

00:15:17.815 --> 00:15:20.622
to those produced by the
transportation industry,

00:15:20.622 --> 00:15:24.133
although this figure is very
controversial suggesting

00:15:24.133 --> 00:15:28.741
that cows might emit as much
gas on earth as vehicles.

00:15:28.741 --> 00:15:31.522
So some in the agricultural
industry caution

00:15:31.522 --> 00:15:33.650
that these are not easy
comparisons to make

00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:35.927
and other factors are, of course, at play.

00:15:35.927 --> 00:15:38.485
But one thing that
conservationists and agricultural

00:15:38.485 --> 00:15:41.977
industry agree on is that
livestock does contribute to

00:15:41.977 --> 00:15:46.310
a substantial percentage of
greenhouse gases in the world.

00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:48.737
The agricultural industry
is making strides, however,

00:15:48.737 --> 00:15:51.683
to reduce gas output by
introducing feeds that create

00:15:51.683 --> 00:15:56.014
less belching in cows,
improving breeding in a way

00:15:56.014 --> 00:15:59.403
that animal health interventions
are done differently,

00:15:59.403 --> 00:16:02.456
and the FAO argues that if
herd sizes were to shrink

00:16:02.456 --> 00:16:03.988
based on these best practices,

00:16:03.988 --> 00:16:07.730
that would mean fewer, yet
more productive, livestock.

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:09.908
So in addition to
belching and passing gas,

00:16:09.908 --> 00:16:12.404
cows also produce a lot of manure.

00:16:12.404 --> 00:16:14.384
It's the end point of their digestion

00:16:14.384 --> 00:16:17.296
and it also produces nitrous oxide.

00:16:17.296 --> 00:16:20.041
So there are many fascinating
new practices being developed

00:16:20.041 --> 00:16:22.959
that are turning manure into electricity.

00:16:22.959 --> 00:16:27.959
Electricity which is then
being sold back to the grid.

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:31.605
So the costs of meat production are high.

00:16:31.605 --> 00:16:33.521
And beyond the environmental costs,

00:16:33.521 --> 00:16:35.438
there's a segment of nutrition science,

00:16:35.438 --> 00:16:37.477
as well as animal rights
activists, that are

00:16:37.477 --> 00:16:41.460
arguing for the elimination of
meat consumption altogether.

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:43.907
But given the global rise
in consumption patterns,

00:16:43.907 --> 00:16:48.473
this doesn't seem to be the
most likely future outcome.

00:16:48.473 --> 00:16:51.084
So despite the nutritional
benefits of consuming meat,

00:16:51.084 --> 00:16:53.869
there are significant
health and environmental

00:16:53.869 --> 00:16:56.040
costs of consumption as well.

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:58.441
That being said, as
we'll hear about today,

00:16:58.441 --> 00:17:01.774
our species has a very long
relationship with red meat.

00:17:01.774 --> 00:17:04.584
It is one of the hallmarks
of human evolution.

00:17:04.584 --> 00:17:06.900
So the question I leave you
with, and one that I borrowed

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:10.131
from Ajit Varki, has
meat in human evolution

00:17:10.131 --> 00:17:12.798
gone from a blessing to a curse?

00:17:13.799 --> 00:17:15.258
Thank you.

00:17:15.258 --> 00:17:17.965
(audience applauds)

00:17:17.965 --> 00:17:20.548
(upbeat music)
