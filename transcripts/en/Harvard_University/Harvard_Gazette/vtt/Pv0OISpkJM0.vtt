00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.620
My aunt she use to always to tap my hands and

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.230
she goes, I love your hands, and she used

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.290
to go like this to me and one time I

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.360
asked her, you know, what's the difference?

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.940
And she said, you just have hands that

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.520
you know how to work with your pottery.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.400
We brought in some friends of mine who

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.200
are traditional potters from the Pueblo of

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.270
Jemez in New Mexico. Willa has been

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.220
making pottery since she was five years

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.070
old. She still practices handmade

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.890
coiled pottery as her ancestors did more

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.680
than a thousand years ago. This year we

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.890
were fortunate enough to come here to

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.180
show how handmade pottery is made and

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.360
what kind of clay we use and everything

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.800
traditional that I do.

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.649
In archeology we usually study ceramics

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:18.780
and pottery after it's been broken and

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.609
used up and buried in the ground for a

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:22.500
couple thousand years, and so we wanted

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.240
the students to see the process from the

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.399
beginning, how pottery is made and how

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:28.380
potters design it and make it out of

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.840
clay. One of the great things about

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.390
anthropology 1010 is that we have this big

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.189
hands-on component, so it's just as

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.929
academic they're just using different

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:38.640
tools to learn and I think it's really

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.829
important to incorporate their hands as

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.990
well as their their brains in learning

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.310
how these artifacts are made.
