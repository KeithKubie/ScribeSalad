Today we'll be talking about one of the articles from our magazine, the benefits of pet ownership, by Jamie Moffatt.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.200
We hope it's helpful!

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:26.520
Many people all over the world have pets and love them just as much, if not more, than their human companions.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.400
Pets are known to provide a type of unconditional love that other humans can not always give.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.160
Thus, humans tend to love their pets way more than their friends.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.700
A key example of this is how dogs are constantly referred to as 'man's best friend.'

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.440
It can be extremely expensive to care for a pet. If you're doing it in the correct manner, anyway.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:54.020
There are many things to account for when you have a pet, such as trips to the vet, food, toys, and all the necessary things for your pet's survival and comfort.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.000
Having a pet is definitely not a thing to take lightly.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.080
Through research, it can be proven that pet owners are more emotionally stable and physically active.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.740
The act of walking your dog, alone, can cause these changes in a person.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.180
Pet owners create a very special bond with their pet, both through walking and just living with them.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.940
People with pets tend to be psychologically healthier because of the bond they have with their pet.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:25.040
Animals can often help people get over or avoid the feeling of loneliness since they are a built-in best friend for their owners.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:34.700
Our pets become our best confidant, our cuddle buddy when we're sad or when we need a good cuddle, and sometimes they are the one thing in our life we know we can count on at the end of the day.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.720
You can gather very similar benefits to being a pet owner no matter what type of pet you own.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.360
Animals provide an amount of emotional and social support that can be vital to a healthy mind and body.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:55.020
This doesn't mean you should run out and buy a pet right away. If you're thinking about pet ownership, then these are simply some extra pluses for pet adoption.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:03.080
Or, if you're having emotional struggles or constantly dealing with loneliness, you may want to look into getting a pet as they are helpful for those kind of things.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:10.000
But if you're going to adopt a pet, do plenty of research and make sure you are ready for all the responsibilities that go along with having a pet.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.880
Pets of all shapes and sizes provide a great amount of unconditional love and so much emotional and social support.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:25.160
They will love you in a way unlike a person you will ever meet. This can be a great thing and can really help you if you're feeling down or like you're alone in the world.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:31.180
Of course, they are not a solution to all problems, as the intensity of mental and emotional issues can vary.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.460
However, having a pet is one of the many ways in which people can have happier and healthier lives.
