1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,750
Hey, I'm Janet. Boom.
Rod. I'm Robert Krulwich.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:06,230
This is radio on our
subject right now is cities.

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:10,430
So far we've tried to pin down the
character of a place with math or with a

4
00:00:10,431 --> 00:00:12,320
story or with some music.

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:14,390
Woo.

6
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:18,850
But it's like trying to take a snapshot
of something that's growing and changing

7
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:22,540
all the time and that feeling
that skip had up on the rooftop,

8
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,870
like the city with breathing. Maybe

9
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:31,250
the city really is like a living
thing. Well, yes. In some ways.

10
00:00:31,251 --> 00:00:35,480
That's exactly right. The evolve, the
grow. Think about it as Jeff West,

11
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:40,190
every day, every minute,
incomes, energy, food, trucks,

12
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:44,300
water people, out goes
garbage ideas, song stories,

13
00:00:44,301 --> 00:00:49,100
people energy in, energy
out, energy, energy,

14
00:00:49,101 --> 00:00:49,430
Huh?

15
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:53,330
That's just what a city needs to
do. Such Jeff port metabolize food,

16
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:57,440
so to speak, because without that,
organisms and sitters and so on,

17
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:02,240
we'll simply do carry. So
how does a city stay alive?

18
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:05,900
What does it really take
for a city to grow? Well,

19
00:01:05,901 --> 00:01:10,901
that question got me thinking about New
York and led me to a place I've been

20
00:01:11,031 --> 00:01:12,170
wanting to go for a while.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,970
[inaudible] to hear the
reverb a little bit.

22
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,950
Where are you underground?
Oh, 100 feet under

23
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:26,993
Brown

24
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:33,450
[inaudible] so this is the sound of
one of New York City's water tunnels.

25
00:01:33,451 --> 00:01:36,690
I'm standing in it. It's
exactly what you would imagine.

26
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,040
It's about nine feet wide, nine
feet up, perfectly polished cement.

27
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,790
And uh, it seems to just go forever.

28
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:50,060
[inaudible]

29
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,440
so this is basically a,

30
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:56,270
like you might call it a smaller artery
inside the city's circulatory system.

31
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:59,480
When this is online, in a couple
of months, it will pump up to

32
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:02,480
290 million gallons a day.

33
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:07,470
[inaudible]

34
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:11,810
something like that, which is an awesome
thought in the literal sense. Yeah,

35
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:15,530
it's a, when you walked through
the streets in Manhattan,

36
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,590
this is Catherine Mallen from the
Department of environmental protection.

37
00:02:18,591 --> 00:02:22,280
These water tunnels are anywhere
from 200 to 800 feet below your feet.

38
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:25,520
They just there and they're silently
there. And when you turn on your tap,

39
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:27,623
can you take a drink?

40
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:35,170
You are basking in a daily convenience
that is born from blood, sweat,

41
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:40,470
and death. To explain.

42
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,590
You really have to go back to a
time when there were no tunnels.

43
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:48,830
This would be 1790 1800 or so around
that time says historian Diane Galicia in

44
00:02:49,891 --> 00:02:54,360
New York's population was
booming. It tripled in 20 years.

45
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:58,800
And you suddenly at 100,000 people all
getting their water from the same spot,

46
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:03,490
a large freshwater pond called the collect
than they had pigs running around by

47
00:03:03,491 --> 00:03:07,090
the hundreds and the chamber pots out
in the streets and there were livestock

48
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,060
and Lower Manhattan. At the
time people had cows for milk.

49
00:03:10,061 --> 00:03:12,340
And so when they died, they
had to do something with them.

50
00:03:12,341 --> 00:03:17,341
So often she says they'd throw their dead
cows and everything else in the pond,

51
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:22,210
the same pond they were
drinking from, right? No,

52
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:27,070
not surprisingly. As the city grew,

53
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,670
people got sick in 1798 there
was this yellow fever epidemic,

54
00:03:30,671 --> 00:03:34,960
killed a couple of thousand people and
cholera and typhoid city officials were

55
00:03:34,961 --> 00:03:37,200
like, this has to change. And uh,

56
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:41,320
as if to accentuate the point
in 1835, it was this huge fire.

57
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:44,350
The fire department rushes out to
put out the fire. But they can't.

58
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:48,370
It was in December and the rivers froze
and they couldn't get water to the

59
00:03:48,371 --> 00:03:52,750
fires. If you don't have water to
fight the fire, the city burns down.

60
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,090
It's pretty simple. Yeah, 700 buildings.

61
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:58,240
So that's our starting point in
New York City that could not grow.

62
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,810
And by the way, the guy we just heard
John Chick Donahue, he's the sand dog.

63
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:06,340
So part of the long line of guys who
blasted New York out of its poopy pawn

64
00:04:06,341 --> 00:04:10,900
phase and into its future. You ask your
question why? Why are you guys cold?

65
00:04:10,901 --> 00:04:15,901
Sandhogs why wouldn't you be calling
tunnel blasters or earth movers or

66
00:04:15,911 --> 00:04:19,150
something that's more, do you have any
idea where that name came from? Yeah,

67
00:04:19,151 --> 00:04:21,880
it comes from the dictionary really,

68
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:25,120
and I loved the look on people's
faces when they asked me that and I,

69
00:04:25,121 --> 00:04:25,990
that's the answer.

70
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:31,000
It's described in Webster's dictionary
as a laborer who digs or works in sand

71
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:35,320
originals sandhogs with the soft
ground guys compressed there.

72
00:04:35,321 --> 00:04:38,710
That's where he didn't know to backup
for a second when the city decided to

73
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:41,890
scrap the pond in favor of
clean water from upstate.

74
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,620
If faced a couple of challenges,
and this is also true.

75
00:04:44,621 --> 00:04:47,830
When they decided to build a
subway system, namely nature,

76
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:51,610
like how do you for example,
build a tunnel under a river?

77
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,210
Well they were sandhogs,
Jamie, Dan, they did

78
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:58,670
little eat dog with what
we call a muck sticks,

79
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,700
shovels on the ribbon,

80
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:05,480
50 60 a hundred feet under the bottom
of the river. Men with shovels,

81
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,800
excavating ground. That's Nick's
socal. I'm a tunneling engineer.

82
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,480
Generally it's a dark, dank

83
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:16,660
place. Now the obvious engineering
problem is that the river bottom,

84
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:21,550
which is now above their heads is
soft sands and silts and gravels.

85
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,650
How do you keep that from
not falling on your head?

86
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,150
That's when a compressed air started
being used. The basic idea says, nick,

87
00:05:28,151 --> 00:05:32,950
is it these huge pumps would basically
pump air into the tunnels at such

88
00:05:32,951 --> 00:05:36,700
pressure that it would basically
push the ceiling up. Exactly.

89
00:05:36,701 --> 00:05:40,390
So the mud doesn't cave in on the
compressed there holes that thing from

90
00:05:40,391 --> 00:05:41,380
collapsing in on.

91
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:47,130
Usually the engineers on the shore had
to get the pressure just right says

92
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,453
chick. Cause if they didn't,

93
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:52,930
you get this absolutely terrifying
situation that is maybe the best cocktail

94
00:05:52,931 --> 00:05:56,920
party story ever. We used to give an
award, we haven't given it many years.

95
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,040
We call it

96
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,360
the Marshall may be award

97
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:01,110
hello,

98
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,140
that were doing one of
those tunnels. Brooklyn.

99
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:08,520
The men are weapon to face
in a tunnel and digging away

100
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:10,950
very suddenly

101
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:16,120
is a blowout in the face of the wallet.
Puncture hole develops tiny at first,

102
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:19,600
but it quickly becomes bigger and bigger
until it's the size of sort of like an

103
00:06:19,601 --> 00:06:23,070
eye. Then a whole head and all the
compressed air rushes into that.

104
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:27,210
Oh, it would be like if you
shot a hole through an airplane.

105
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:33,210
Alia with shawl hats are flying into this
whole lanterns shovels than a guy goes

106
00:06:33,781 --> 00:06:38,260
into the whole a guy. Yeah, a human being
into the hole and another guy, boom.

107
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:41,700
Then a third, the third guy must've
been the luckiest sand hog in the world.

108
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:45,120
This is an article from the New
York Times as I struck the mud,

109
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:50,180
it felt as if something was squeezing
me tighter than I'd ever been squeezed

110
00:06:50,181 --> 00:06:52,870
before. We blew through
all at 60 feet and walked

111
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,873
through the Redmond.

112
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:57,020
Yup.

113
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,070
To the surface. The pressure

114
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,710
blew him right up into
the, yeah, you tell me.

115
00:07:03,711 --> 00:07:07,430
I was thrown about 25 feet
above the water when I came out,

116
00:07:07,431 --> 00:07:11,180
but I don't remember that.
That's remarkable. Anything

117
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:17,980
back down and landed right alongside
a police boat in the one in the world.

118
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:21,560
So they took him to clean
them up. He went home.

119
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:26,600
He came to work the next day.
That's why they gave him the award.

120
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,060
That's why the award is
now. I'm not kidding you.

121
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:34,431
In the early days,

122
00:07:34,431 --> 00:07:38,660
no one kept track of how many people
died building New York's tunnels the

123
00:07:38,661 --> 00:07:42,410
number. It's probably in the thousands.
So wait, this, this right here,

124
00:07:42,411 --> 00:07:45,260
this plaque that we're looking
at, this flack was a donated.

125
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:49,880
This is Richie fits in and
sees the current head of
the San hugs union and we're

126
00:07:49,881 --> 00:07:52,730
standing in front of a big stone
plaque with two dozen names

127
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,440
in memory of all the, uh,

128
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:59,150
people that we lost in tunnels in
New York City since 1970. You know,

129
00:07:59,151 --> 00:08:00,650
since we started keeping records,

130
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:04,420
small little photos commodity.
Later he showed me a picture,

131
00:08:04,421 --> 00:08:06,250
which really underlined the point.

132
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:10,570
It's a picture of him on his first
compressed air job. Oh Wow. Look at that.

133
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,280
This is myself.

134
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:15,880
He's 19 he's huddled with five other guys
and they're in this crowded tunnel and

135
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:19,450
they're all black, was said, and
he points to each guy in turn

136
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:23,600
dead, dead, dead, dead,

137
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:26,920
had cancer still alive, still alive.

138
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:30,520
If you ask any of the
sandhogs why they do this,

139
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,250
mostly they'll tell you
what we, we've got to,

140
00:08:33,251 --> 00:08:35,110
the city can't grow without its tunnels,

141
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:39,100
but you also get answers like
this from chick. If he says,

142
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:41,920
when you're down there and it's pitch
black and you're just walking away

143
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:45,630
and yeah, 600 foot under Manhattan,

144
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:47,790
you're approximately
30th street or something,

145
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:50,550
you're in the middle of the
greatest city in the world.

146
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,680
Nobody even knows you exist.
Nobody has it. Nobody has a clue.

147
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:57,363
It just

148
00:08:58,940 --> 00:08:59,773
beautiful.

149
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:07,080
It's just that it's a weird place.
It's like being on a planet somewhere.

150
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,580
He says when he's literally in this
rock that is half a billion years old,

151
00:09:11,581 --> 00:09:12,750
he sometimes feels

152
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,580
very humble.

153
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,460
Yeah, we're in the middle of the
art. Then you know how this is.

154
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:23,990
You want to see nature. It is
a romantic way of saying it.

155
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:29,300
A, the human reality of it
is, here's Richie's taken.

156
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:32,360
Remember when you were a kid and they
used to give you the Anne farms in the bay

157
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:36,200
and farms were big. We are ants.

158
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:42,520
Ants is so fricking many of them that if
you got a squish a few and if they got

159
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:47,450
to use each other to step over each other
to, to, to, to keep that whole thing,

160
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:50,360
that's it. That doesn't sound very grand
the way you're putting it like that.

161
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:54,740
It's reality. Our job is to conquer
nature. He says, plain and simple.

162
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:59,510
We're builders. Human beings
are builders and collectively

163
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,780
there's nothing that we can do.

164
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,720
Hmm. How often?

165
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:15,810
October 14th, 1842 oh, it
was a huge celebration.

166
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,910
Hundreds of thousands
of New Yorkers. Line,

167
00:10:17,911 --> 00:10:22,911
Broadway was firing of cannons and the
ringing of Church bell fireworks even,

168
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,750
and at the end of it all says Diane,

169
00:10:27,751 --> 00:10:31,490
everybody gathered in City Hall Park
and the turned a big fountain on and

170
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:36,500
[inaudible]

171
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,810
water shot 50 feet into the air.

172
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:45,780
New York City. We'd never be the
same. No can finally be a city.

173
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,770
But here's where you start to wonder
a little bit about the real legacy of

174
00:10:49,771 --> 00:10:54,330
cities. What you see almost immediately
after this moment, according to Diane,

175
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:58,410
is that water usage skyrocketed.
Suddenly you had indoor plumbing.

176
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,370
All the new buildings were being
outfitted with water closets and kids were

177
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:05,370
playing in the hydrants all day
long. And to make a long story short,

178
00:11:05,371 --> 00:11:08,610
just 10 years later, the
city is out of water again.

179
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,680
So they get to build more
tunnels and then more.

180
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,440
And if you follow the water and
those tunnels, backup state,

181
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:16,820
you see that the city is gobbling up
reservoirs, one after another, dozens,

182
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:20,430
which made it had to kick people off that
land, well then called eminent domain.

183
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:24,540
Their villages would have to be bulldozed
and burned cemeteries fruited do you

184
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:25,140
see what's happening?

185
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:29,250
I mean you could see this city that
we live in as a kind of monster.

186
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:33,690
It's just always hungry,
eat, eat, eat, eat, eat. And

187
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,650
because like, like there is
another logic available here.

188
00:11:36,651 --> 00:11:40,070
Like if you took all the people in
New York City, all those New Yorkers,

189
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:40,901
you know, if,

190
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:44,150
if you had every inhabitant in New York
City suddenly left New York City and

191
00:11:44,151 --> 00:11:45,800
moved to small towns all across America,

192
00:11:45,801 --> 00:11:48,620
you would need a ton of
resources to make that possible.

193
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,260
That's Jonah lira again,
by the way. So in a sense,

194
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:54,010
New York City saves lots of forests, saves

195
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,780
lots of water. And the reason why,

196
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:00,820
well that takes us back to
Jeff and Lucia's ideas about
cities. Well I suppose,

197
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,440
cause it all started years ago,

198
00:12:02,441 --> 00:12:06,250
Jeff at the time was studying
this time was living things.

199
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:07,900
Let's go back to biology for a moment.

200
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:13,110
He looked at a huge variety of creatures
and for each one he collected data from

201
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:17,620
its metabolic rate to the length
of it, say how quickly it breathes.

202
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,700
And he discovered something kind of
fascinating about creatures as they grow

203
00:12:21,701 --> 00:12:26,170
bigger and picker. If you
double the size of an organism,

204
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:29,770
you double the number of cells
that need to be sustained.

205
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:34,570
You would therefore expect that the
energy you need to supply would double.

206
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,350
You've doubled the number of customers,
so to speak. Yeah, yeah. No, no.

207
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:41,500
That is not the case. Instead of doubling,

208
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:46,830
it needs less energy per unit cell
to sustain the whole organism.

209
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,170
So there is a kind of notice
way. Second, that means that the,

210
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,480
that the cell is somehow
doing more with less. Right.

211
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:58,090
Does that also mean though
that an elephant cell somehow
is more efficient than

212
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,910
mouth cell? That's correct.
Huh. And Jeff says,

213
00:13:00,911 --> 00:13:04,840
the way they do that is pretty
simple. They just move slow.

214
00:13:04,841 --> 00:13:09,370
I process energy at a slower
rate. So if you take a mouse cell,

215
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:12,730
a cell that lives in a mouse and
does its work, brings in resources,

216
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,560
spits out the waste,
bring in more resources,

217
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:17,230
spits out the way it
does this to a particular

218
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,433
beep.

219
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:25,320
But now says Jeff, if you
listen to an elephant cell,

220
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:26,220
okay.

221
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,753
[inaudible] means no

222
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:33,450
poem. It's moving

223
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:38,010
obviously slower. So it's using
less energy in a given moment,

224
00:13:38,011 --> 00:13:41,690
which makes it efficient. What
does that have to do with cities?

225
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:45,350
Turns out cities work kind
of the same way in cities.

226
00:13:45,351 --> 00:13:48,620
You see the same kind of efficiency
when it comes to infrastructure,

227
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:53,480
electricity, length of roads, lengths
of pipes, lengths of electrical, cables,

228
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:57,920
saline, how much gas is consumed
is the point. The bigger the city,

229
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:02,120
the less roads you need per capita. What
is per capita mean anyways, per person,

230
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,600
per person, the less electrical
cable lines you need per capita,

231
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:09,920
the less gasoline stations you need
per capita, et Cetera, et cetera.

232
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:12,980
So every unit of pipe carries
more water and more sewage.

233
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:16,970
Every line of electrical wire
carries more. It did. Jeff,

234
00:14:16,971 --> 00:14:19,220
does that mean then that if, uh,

235
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,730
if I moved to a bigger and bigger city,

236
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:28,180
do I in a sense become greener
the bigger the city I live in?

237
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:34,100
Yeah, that's a very interesting question.
And this is where Lewish and Jeff,

238
00:14:34,101 --> 00:14:37,040
I think the case is still a
little bit out. And even Jonah,

239
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:39,890
it gets complicated when you ask,
are people more or less efficient?

240
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,880
This is when everybody starts to
throw in all of these caveats and

241
00:14:43,881 --> 00:14:45,710
qualifications, all the variable

242
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:52,190
qualifications and ambulations and
prognostications. Distillations.

243
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,400
Let me just tell you what I think.
I think you'd better. All right.

244
00:14:55,401 --> 00:14:57,950
We all love to talk about how green
we are when we live in cities.

245
00:14:57,951 --> 00:15:00,980
This is something everybody in the city
talks about, right? Because we are,

246
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:05,140
because we take the subway and the
bus, we don't draw and driving. Right.

247
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:07,820
The most energy consuming
thing. Listen to me,

248
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:11,510
the analogy that you just gave
me, it does not work. Okay.

249
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:16,460
You said that cells as they go from
small bodies to big bodies slow down.

250
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:20,360
Yeah. Well cities, the opposite
happens. Of course as cities get bigger,

251
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:24,790
each individual unit in that city moves
faster. So thank you Jonah. We speed up.

252
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:27,470
It's true. We learned this earlier
and this is not trivial. Okay.

253
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:31,190
Cause as we speed up, we bump into
more people. We have more ideas,

254
00:15:31,191 --> 00:15:33,860
we invent new things, we want more things.

255
00:15:33,861 --> 00:15:38,300
We want more or more of
your tastes. New Ideas.

256
00:15:38,301 --> 00:15:42,380
More interactions. More human
friction. More. More choices. Yeah,

257
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:45,590
a better life. That's what
a city is all about. I,

258
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:48,260
is there anything wrong
with that? No, not at all.

259
00:15:48,261 --> 00:15:52,340
But there's all I'm saying is there's
a cost to it that we don't acknowledge.

260
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:55,640
Western Betancourt did this back of the
envelope calculation where it's long

261
00:15:55,641 --> 00:15:57,680
been known that a body at perfect rest,

262
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,720
if you lie on your bed all day in a coma,

263
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,730
you will consume and buy
90 watts of electricity.

264
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:04,280
That's your basal metabolic rate.

265
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:07,850
If you're a hunter gatherer living
in some tribe in New Zealand,

266
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,970
you will consume about 240
watts of electricity every day.

267
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:15,650
Energy just simply to stay alive,
plus the energy you need to hunt them.

268
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:20,680
However, if you are living in America,
the wattage required to drive your car,

269
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:23,930
run your computer, make your
clothes, air conditioning,

270
00:16:23,931 --> 00:16:27,650
being able to go to movies on and on and
all the various things that constituted

271
00:16:27,651 --> 00:16:29,240
our life. If you add all those up,

272
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:33,950
your lifestyle requires about 11,000
watts of electricity every day. So that's,

273
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:37,370
that's more energy than a blue whale
requires. Now, some of you listening,

274
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:39,920
particularly if you're engine
deer, you may think, wait a second,

275
00:16:39,921 --> 00:16:41,030
why are you calling these watts?

276
00:16:41,031 --> 00:16:45,140
When his power through his system power
through a human, call them jewels.

277
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:48,080
It's the technically correct word.
And then you'd be right, wouldn't you?

278
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:50,360
But the numbers are the same. So
let's, we'll just call them lots.

279
00:16:50,361 --> 00:16:54,740
So one way to look at what cities have
enabled us to do is basically live like

280
00:16:54,741 --> 00:16:56,870
300 and million blue whales in America.

281
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,810
Are you sure that cities are
causing this development?

282
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:03,470
That it begins and ends with cities
and you can't assign it all to cities.

283
00:17:03,471 --> 00:17:07,490
But that psychology of wanting
more, that's a city psychology.

284
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:08,990
It's why people come to cities.

285
00:17:08,991 --> 00:17:13,700
And then the lifestyle that grows up
around that gets broadcast out on TV and

286
00:17:13,701 --> 00:17:16,910
radio shows and movies, which are
city industries to the country.

287
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:19,040
And if you just take a
historical look at this,

288
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:23,960
like the last 300 years have seen more
and more consumption, right? Yeah.

289
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:25,880
And that trend says Jones,

290
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:30,200
it's grown in neat parallel
with the growth of cities.

291
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,060
Cities have enabled that kind of
growth. Even if you guys are a right,

292
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:39,470
we know that half the planet already
is living in cities, 80% of America.

293
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,470
So yes, there are more people.
I'll agree with that. More choices,

294
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:45,230
asking for more consumption, more
energy, more, more, more, more, more.

295
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:50,310
Even if that's so cities,
because they are ingenious

296
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:51,870
and they come up with all these new ideas.

297
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:55,310
Maybe cities will solve the
problem right now. Jets,

298
00:17:55,311 --> 00:18:00,311
someone somewhere in Calcutta is about
to invent the super light bulb elevator

299
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:05,780
telephone pipe that will make it possible
for another 200 trillion people to

300
00:18:05,821 --> 00:18:09,990
live together in peace, harmony,
and beauty until the next round.

301
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:10,860
All right?

302
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:14,910
You go ahead and claim to that optimism
and you of course can go hang yourself

303
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:19,780
in corner, so we'll be right back.
I remember crawling. That's dad.

304
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:20,790
He was Radiolab.
