00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.869
Let's wrap up our topic for today.

00:00:01.869 --> 00:00:03.873
So today,
we've talked about generate and test,

00:00:03.873 --> 00:00:06.118
which is a very general purpose
problem solving method.

00:00:06.118 --> 00:00:08.802
As Ashok mentioned earlier in
our lesson, we see generate and

00:00:08.802 --> 00:00:10.453
test every day in our regular lives and

00:00:10.453 --> 00:00:12.736
it's something in which
we engage very naturally.

00:00:12.736 --> 00:00:15.184
We talked about strong generators and
strong testers and

00:00:15.184 --> 00:00:18.193
how we can build intelligence into one
side or the other in order to make

00:00:18.193 --> 00:00:21.270
the problem solving process easier and
more efficient.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.610
We also talked about how generating
tests is more difficult and

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.500
unconstrained domains and
how our generator and tester need to be

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.320
equipped with special kinds of knowledge
in order to make this problem solvable.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.656
Next, we're going to be looking at two
different problem solving methods that

00:00:33.656 --> 00:00:36.017
build on what we've seen
today with generate and test.

00:00:36.017 --> 00:00:38.385
Means and analysis and
problem reduction.

00:00:38.385 --> 00:00:41.540
Like generate and test, these are both
very general purpose, but they're going

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.340
to do things a little bit differently
and make certain problems easier.
