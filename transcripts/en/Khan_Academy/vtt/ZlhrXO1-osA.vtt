00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:07.360
So we have here, it says 2 times
4/3 is equal to 8 times blank.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.090
And what I encourage you to do
is pause the video right now

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.940
and try to think about what
should go in this blank.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.360
So I'm assuming
you've given your try.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.180
Now, let's think through this.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.300
So 2 times 4/3, we can literally
view that as the same thing

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:31.410
as-- if we rewrite the 4/3, this
is the same thing as 2 times--

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.060
instead of writing
4/3 like this,

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.440
I'm literally going to
write it as four 1/3's.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.180
And I know it sounds like I just
said the same thing over again.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.820
But I'm literally going to write
1/3 four times-- 1/3 plus 1/3

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.730
plus 1/3 plus 1/3.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.270
If you call each of
these 1/3, you literally

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:51.260
have four of them.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.700
This is four 1/3's.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:59.090
2 times 4/3 is the same thing as
2 times, literally, four 1/3's.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.710
Now, what would this be?

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.810
Well, this is going to be equal
to-- let me just copy and paste

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.460
this-- is going to
be this two times.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.920
So copy, and then
let me paste it.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.470
So that's one group of
those 1/3's, of those four

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.000
1/3's, or one group of
one of these four 1/3's.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.055
And then, we'll
have another one.

00:01:23.055 --> 00:01:24.430
And then, we'll
have another one.

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:25.971
And we're going to
add them together.

00:01:25.971 --> 00:01:29.090
That's literally 2 times 4/3.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.010
So let's add these together.

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.220
Now what do we have?

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.812
Well, we have a bunch of 1/3's.

00:01:33.812 --> 00:01:35.020
And we need to count them up.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.540
We have one, two, three, four,
five, six , seven, eight 1/3's.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.110
This is literally
equal to-- and we

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.210
could, just to make it
clear what I've just done,

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.490
we could ignore the
parentheses and just add up

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.059
all of these things together.

00:01:49.059 --> 00:01:50.850
So that might make it
a little bit clearer.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.190
So let me do that just to
make it clear that I literally

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.540
take-- I've taken eight 1/3's
and I'm adding them together,

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.150
which is the exact
same thing as 8/3.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:06.590
So let me clear that, and let me
clear that, let me clear that.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.710
And so this is literally, or
this is clearly, or hopefully

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:16.080
clearly, equal to 8 times 1/3.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.860
I have 8 1/3's there.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.560
So going back to the
original question,

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.476
what is this equal to?

00:02:21.476 --> 00:02:25.810
2 times 4/3 is the same
thing as 8 times 1/3.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.210
And we've already seen
that 8 times 1/3, well,

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.240
that's literally 8/3.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.325
So we could also write
it like this-- 8 over 3.

00:02:36.325 --> 00:02:42.874
Let me do that 3 in that
other color-- 8 over 3.
