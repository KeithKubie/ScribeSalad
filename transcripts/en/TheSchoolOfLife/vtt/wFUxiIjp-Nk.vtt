00:00:00.043 --> 00:00:02.678
Trying to be a better friend to yourself

00:00:02.868 --> 00:00:04.337
sounds like an odd idea.

00:00:04.481 --> 00:00:05.124
Initially

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.324
because we naturally imagine a friend

00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:08.404
as someone else,

00:00:08.874 --> 00:00:10.977
not as a part of our own mind.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.045
But there is value in the concept

00:00:13.261 --> 00:00:15.094
because of the extent to which we know how

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.747
to treat our own friends,

00:00:16.772 --> 00:00:18.701
with the sympathy and imagination

00:00:18.726 --> 00:00:19.941
we seldom apply,

00:00:20.055 --> 00:00:21.226
to ourselves.

00:00:21.628 --> 00:00:22.866
If a friend is in trouble

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.857
our first instinct is rarely to tell them

00:00:24.882 --> 00:00:26.287
that they are fundamentally

00:00:26.363 --> 00:00:27.932
a sh*thead and a failure

00:00:28.348 --> 00:00:30.164
If a friend complains that their partner

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:31.395
isn't very warm to them,

00:00:31.724 --> 00:00:33.779
we don't tell them they're getting
what they deserve

00:00:33.925 --> 00:00:36.735
we try to re-assure them that
they're essentially likeable

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.099
and that it's worth investigating

00:00:38.124 --> 00:00:39.157
what might be done.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:40.374
In friendship

00:00:40.565 --> 00:00:41.835
we know instinctively

00:00:42.028 --> 00:00:45.072
how to deploy strategies of
wisdom and consolation

00:00:45.295 --> 00:00:47.445
that we stubbornly refuse to apply

00:00:47.588 --> 00:00:48.588
to ourselves.

00:00:49.092 --> 00:00:50.497
There are some key moves

00:00:50.522 --> 00:00:52.140
a good friend would typically make

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.689
which can provide a model

00:00:53.771 --> 00:00:55.207
for what we should, ideally

00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:57.607
be doing with ourselves, in our own heads.

00:00:58.046 --> 00:01:01.467
Firstly, a good friend likes you
pretty much as you already are.

00:01:01.738 --> 00:01:03.111
Any suggestion they make or

00:01:03.136 --> 00:01:05.589
ambition they have about
how you could change

00:01:05.617 --> 00:01:08.038
builds on a background of acceptance.

00:01:08.374 --> 00:01:10.675
When they propose that you might try
a different tack

00:01:10.977 --> 00:01:13.036
it's not an ultimatum or a threat.

00:01:13.235 --> 00:01:16.038
They're not saying that you have to change
or be abandoned.

00:01:16.326 --> 00:01:17.469
A friend insists

00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:18.891
we're good enough, already,

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.821
but they want to join forces with us

00:01:20.847 --> 00:01:22.807
to solve a challenge they feel

00:01:22.857 --> 00:01:25.174
we would properly benefit, from overcoming.

00:01:26.028 --> 00:01:27.361
Without being flattering,

00:01:27.385 --> 00:01:29.861
good friends also constantly keep in mind

00:01:29.905 --> 00:01:31.913
certain things, we're getting right!

00:01:32.201 --> 00:01:33.438
They don't think anything wrong
(background cheering)

00:01:33.463 --> 00:01:34.561
with the odd compliment
(background cheering)

00:01:34.586 --> 00:01:36.213
and emphasis on our strengths.
(background cheering)

00:01:36.696 --> 00:01:37.930
It's quietly galling

00:01:37.955 --> 00:01:39.531
how easily we can lose sight of

00:01:39.556 --> 00:01:41.263
all our own good points,

00:01:41.384 --> 00:01:42.452
when troubles strike.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.847
A friend doesn't fall into this trap.

00:01:45.177 --> 00:01:46.887
They can acknowledge the difficulties

00:01:46.915 --> 00:01:48.791
while still holding on to a memory

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:50.046
of our virtues.

00:01:50.377 --> 00:01:52.145
The good friend is compassionate;

00:01:52.382 --> 00:01:54.106
when we fail, as we will

00:01:54.134 --> 00:01:55.361
they are understanding

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:57.524
and generous around our mishaps.

00:01:57.791 --> 00:02:01.210
Our folly, doesn't exclude them from the
circle of their love.

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.430
The good friend definitely conveys

00:02:03.457 --> 00:02:05.643
that to err, fail and screw up

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.445
is just what we humans do.

00:02:07.827 --> 00:02:09.436
We all emerge from childhood

00:02:09.521 --> 00:02:11.498
with various biases in our character

00:02:11.728 --> 00:02:13.568
which evolved to help us cope with our

00:02:13.596 --> 00:02:15.854
necessarily imperfect parents

00:02:16.315 --> 00:02:17.974
and these acquired habits of mind

00:02:18.233 --> 00:02:20.886
will reliably let us down in adult life.

00:02:21.167 --> 00:02:22.926
But, we're not to be blamed because

00:02:22.951 --> 00:02:25.408
we didn't deliberately set out to
be like this.

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:28.480
We didn't realistically,
have a lot of better options

00:02:28.703 --> 00:02:30.139
We're indelibly required

00:02:30.167 --> 00:02:31.466
to make big decisions

00:02:31.494 --> 00:02:33.974
before we ever really understand
what's at stake

00:02:34.104 --> 00:02:35.964
or how our choices will play out.

00:02:36.397 --> 00:02:39.593
We steering blind in all our large moves
around love

00:02:39.823 --> 00:02:40.458
and work.

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.723
We opt for a move to a different city

00:02:42.866 --> 00:02:45.471
but we can't possibly know whether
we're going to flourish there

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:48.305
We have to select a career path
when we're still young

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.798
and we don't know what our
latent needs will be

00:02:51.217 --> 00:02:52.508
in long term relationships

00:02:52.643 --> 00:02:54.736
We have to make a commitment
to another person

00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.897
before we understand
what it will be like

00:02:56.922 --> 00:02:59.639
to tie our lives, so deeply to theirs'

00:02:59.934 --> 00:03:01.197
The good friend knows

00:03:01.335 --> 00:03:04.183
that failures are not in fact, rare

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:05.819
They bring as a starting point

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.195
their own and humanity's vivid experience
of messing up

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.370
into play

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:12.072
as key points of reference.

00:03:12.362 --> 00:03:13.687
They're continually telling us

00:03:13.816 --> 00:03:16.153
that our specific case, might be unique

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.598
but that the general structure, is common.

00:03:19.052 --> 00:03:21.108
People, don't just sometimes fail

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:22.521
Everyone fails,

00:03:22.643 --> 00:03:24.445
only, we don't know about it

00:03:24.907 --> 00:03:27.115
It's ironic, yet essentially hopeful

00:03:27.252 --> 00:03:28.947
that we usually know quite well

00:03:29.062 --> 00:03:30.353
how to be a better friend

00:03:30.381 --> 00:03:31.601
to near strangers

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:34.097
than we know how to be, to ourselves.

00:03:34.455 --> 00:03:36.774
The hopefulness lies in the fact that we do

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:38.358
actually already possess

00:03:38.487 --> 00:03:40.413
the relevant skills of friendship.

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:42.943
It's just, we haven't as yet directed them

00:03:43.115 --> 00:03:44.833
to the person, who probably

00:03:44.947 --> 00:03:46.152
needs the most

00:03:46.274 --> 00:03:46.858
namely,

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.804
of course

00:03:47.991 --> 00:03:49.124
ourselves.
