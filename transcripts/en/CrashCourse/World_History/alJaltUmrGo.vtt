Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course World
History, and today we're gonna discuss 19th

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.600
century imperialism. So the 19th century certainly
didn't invent the empire, but it did take

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.150
it to new heights, by which we mean lows,
or possibly heights, I dunno, I can't decide,

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:14.720
roll the intro while I think about it.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:23.360
[theme music]

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.980
Yeah, I don't know, I'm still undecided. Let's
begin with China! When last we checked in,

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.660
China was a thriving manufacturing power,
about to be overtaken by Europe, but still

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.320
heavily involved in world trade, especially
an importer of silver from the Spanish empire.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.400
Europeans had to use silver because they didn't
really produce anything else the Chinese wanted,

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.040
and that state of affairs continued through
the 18th century. For example, in 1793, the

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.000
Macartney Mission tried to get better trade
conditions with China and was a total failure.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.510
Here's the Qianlong Emperor's well known response
to the British: "Hither to all European nations

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.379
including your own country's barbarian merchants
have carried on their trade with our celestial

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:01.489
empire at Canton. Such has been the procedure
for many years, although our celestial empire

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:07.609
possesses all things in prolific abundance
and lacks no product within its own borders."

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:12.320
But then Europeans, especially the British,
found something that the Chinese would buy:

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.660
opium. By the 1830s, British free trade policy
unleashed a flood of opium in China, which

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.299
threatened China's favorable balance of trade.
It also created a lot of drug addicts.

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.810
And then in 1839 the Chinese responded to
what they saw as these unfair trade practices

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.460
with...a stern letter that they never actually
sent. Commissioner Lin Zexu drafted a response

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.549
that contained a memorable threat to "cut
off trade in rhubarb, silk, and tea, all valuable

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.689
products of ours without which foreigners
could not live."

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:42.700
But even if the British had received this
terrifying threat to their precious rhubarb

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.000
supply, they probably wouldn't have responded
because selling drugs is super lucrative.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.950
So the Chinese made like tea partiers, confiscating
a bunch of British opium and chucking it into

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.799
the sea. And then the British responded to
this by demanding compensation, and access

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.390
to Chinese territory where they could carry
out their trade.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.600
And then the Chinese were like, "Man that
seems a little bit harsh," whereupon the British

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.930
sent in gunships, opening trade with Canton
by force.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.830
Chinese General Yijing made a counter attack
in 1842 that included a detailed plan to catapult

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.770
flaming monkeys onto British ships. Stan,
is that true?

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.800
All right, apparently the plans actually involved
strapping fireworks to monkeys' backs and

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.620
were never carried out, but still!

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.959
Slightly off topic: obviously I don't want
anyone to light monkeys on fire. I'm just

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:27.730
saying that flaming monkeys lend themselves
to a lot of great band names, like the Sizzling

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.090
Simians, Burning Bonobos, Immolated Marmoset...Stan,
sometimes I feel like I should give up teaching

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.430
world history and just become a band name
generator. That's my real gift.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.440
Anyway, due to lack of monkey fireworks, the
Chinese counterattacks were unsuccessful,

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.200
and they eventually signed the treaty of Nanjing,
which stated that Britain got Hong Kong and

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.190
five other treaty ports, as well as the equivalent
of two billion dollars in cash. Also, the

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.379
Chinese basically gave up all sovereignty
to European spheres of influence, wherein

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.959
Europeans were subject to their laws, not
Chinese laws.

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.810
In exchange for all of this, China got a hot
slice of nothing. You might think the result

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.060
of this war would be a shift in the balance
of trade in Britain's favor, but that wasn't

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.400
immediately the case. In fact, the British
were importing so much tea from China that

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.170
the trade deficit actually rose more than
30 billion dollars.

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.470
But eventually after another war and one of
the most destructive civil rebellions in Chinese

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.190
and possibly world history, the Taiping Rebellion,
the situation was reversed, and Europeans,

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.610
especially the British, became the dominant
economic power in China.

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.950
Okay. So but when we think about the 19th
century imperialism, we usually think about

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:30.150
the way that Europe turned Africa from this
[map] into this [map], the so-called scramble

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.980
for Africa. Speaking of scrambles and the
European colonization of Africa, you know

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.400
what they say--sometimes to make an omelette,
you have to break a few eggs. And sometimes,

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.120
you break a lot of eggs and you don't get
an omelette.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.909
Europeans have been involved in Africa since
the 16th century, when the Portuguese used

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:47.730
their cannons to take control of cities on
coast to set up their trading post empire,

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.909
but in the second half of the 19th century,
Europe suddenly and spectacularly succeeded

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:54.959
at colonizing basically all of Africa. Why?

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.439
Well, the biggest reason that Europeans were
able to extend their grasp over so much of

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:02.979
the world was the same reason they wanted
to do so in the first place: industrialization.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.400
Nationalism played its part, of course. European
states saw it as a real bonus to be able say

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.900
that they had colonies--so much so, that a
children's rhyme in An ABC for Baby Patriots

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:19.580
went, "C is for colonies. Rightly we boast.
That of all great countries Great Britain has the most."

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:23.560
But it was mostly, not to get all Marxist
on you or anything, about controlling the

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.169
means of production. Europeans wanted colonies
to secure sources of raw materials, especially

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:33.520
cotton, copper, iron, and rubber, that were
used to fuel their growing industrial economies.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.800
And in addition to providing the motive for
imperialism, European industrialization also

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.820
provided the means. Europeans didn't fail
to take over territory in Africa until the

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:47.680
late 19th century because they didn't want to; they failed
because they couldn't. This was mostly due to disease.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.080
Unlike in the Americas, Africans weren't devastated
by diseases like smallpox because they'd had

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.020
smallpox for centuries and were just as immune
to it as Europeans were. Not only that, but

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.640
Africa had diseases of its own, including
yellow fever, malaria, and sleeping sickness,

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.560
all of which killed Europeans in staggering
numbers.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.780
Also, nagana was a disease endemic to Africa
that killed horses, which made it difficult

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.490
for Europeans to take advantage of African
grasslands, and also difficult for them to

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.300
get inland, because their horses would die
as they tried to carry stuff.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.770
Also, while in the 16th century Europeans
did have guns, they were pretty useless, especially

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.650
without horses. So most fighting was done
the old-fashioned way, with swords. That worked

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.050
pretty well in the Americas, unless you were
the Incas or the Aztecs, but it didn't work

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.590
in Africa, because the Africans also had swords.
And spears, and axes.

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.610
So as much as they might have wanted to colonize
Africa in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries,

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.770
Africa's mosquitoes, microbes, and people
were too much for them.

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.820
So what made the difference? Technology.

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:46.080
First, steam ships made it possible for Europeans
to travel inland, bringing supplies and personnel

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.580
via Africa's navigable rivers. No horses?
No problem.

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.440
Even more important was quinine medicine,
sometimes in the form of tonic water, mixed

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:57.650
into refreshing quintessentially British gin
and tonics. Quinine isn't as effective as

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:02.030
modern antimalarial medication, and it doesn't
cure the disease, but it does help moderate its effects.

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:06.319
But of course the most important technology
that enabled Europeans to dominate Africa

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:11.229
was guns. By the 19th century, European gun
technology had improved dramatically, especially

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:15.900
with the introduction of the Maxim machine
gun, which allowed Europeans to wipe out Africans

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.980
in battle after battle. Of course, machine
guns were effective when wielded by Africans,

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.860
too, but Africans had fewer of them.

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.720
Oh, it's time for the open letter? And my
chair is back!

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:31.920
An open letter to Hiram Maxim. But first, let's
see what's in the secret compartment today.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:36.700
Oh, it's Darth Vader! What a great
reminder of imperialism.

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:41.531
Dear Hiram Maxim, I hate you. It's not so
much that you invented the Maxim machine gun,

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.160
although obviously that's a little bit problematic,
or even that you look like the poor man's

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:48.910
Colonel Sanders. First off, you're a possible
bigamist. I have a long standing opposition

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:53.300
to bigamy. Secondly, you were born an American
but became a Brit, thereby metaphorically

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:57.229
machine gunning our founding fathers. But
most importantly, among your many inventions

00:06:57.229 --> 00:07:02.580
was the successful amusement park ride, the
Captive Flying Machine. Mr. Maxim, I hate

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:06.949
the Captive Flying Machine. The Captive Flying
Machine has resulted in many a girlfriend

00:07:06.949 --> 00:07:11.049
telling me that I'm a coward. I'm not a coward,
I just don't want to die up there! It's all

00:07:11.049 --> 00:07:14.320
your fault, Hiram Maxim, and nobody
believes your story about the light bulb.

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.940
Best wishes, John Green.

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:20.030
All right. So, here is something that often
gets overlooked. European imperialism involved

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:24.660
a lot of fighting and a lot of dying. And
when we say that Europe came to dominate Africa,

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:29.630
for the most part that domination came through
wars, which killed lots of Africans and also

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:33.580
lots of Europeans, although most of them died
from disease. It's very, very important to

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:39.360
remember that Africans did not meekly acquiesce
to European hegemony: they resisted, often

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:43.960
violently, but ultimately they were defeated
by a technologically superior enemy.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:47.760
In this respect, they were a lot like the
Chinese, and also the Indians, and the Vietnamese,

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.020
and -- you get the picture.

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:53.030
So by the end of the 19th century, most of
Africa and much of Asia had been colonized

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:57.470
by European powers. I mean, even Belgium got in on it,
and they weren't even a country at the beginning

00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:02.000
of the 19th century. I mean, Belgium has enjoyed
like, 12 years of sovereignty in the last 3 millennia.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.199
Notable exceptions include Japan, which was
happily pursuing its own imperialism, Thailand,

00:08:06.199 --> 00:08:11.299
Iran, and of course Afghanistan. Because no
one can conquer Afghanistan,

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:16.240
unless you are -- wait for it -- the Mongols.
[Mongoltage]

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:20.400
It's tempting to imagine Europe ruling their
colonies with the proverbial topaz fist, and while

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:25.360
there was always the threat of violence, the truth is a
lot more complicated. Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:29.360
In most cases, Europeans ruled their colonies
with the help of, and sometimes completely

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:34.180
through, intermediaries and collaborators.
For example, in the 1890s in India, there

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:41.080
were fewer than 1,000 British administrators
supposedly ruling over 300 million Indians.

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:45.640
The vast majority of British troops at any
given time in India, more than two-thirds,

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:48.880
were in fact Indians under the command of
British officers.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:53.320
Because of their small numbers relative to local
populations, most European colonizers resorted

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:59.160
to indirect rule, relying on governments that were
already there but exerting control  over their leaders.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:03.820
Frederick Lugard, who was Britain's head honcho
in Nigeria for a time, called this "rule through

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:08.320
and by the natives." This worked particularly
well with British administrators, who were

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:13.480
primarily middle class men but had aristocratic
pretensions, and were often pleased to associate

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:16.030
with the highest echelons of Indian or African
society.

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:20.180
Now, this isn't to say that indigenous rulers
were simply puppets. Often, they retained

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:24.380
real power. This was certainly true in India,
where more than a third of the territory was

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:29.690
ruled by Indian princes. The French protectorates
of Morocco and Tunisia were ruled by Arab

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:33.980
monarchs, and the French also ruled through
native kings in Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam.

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:39.160
For the most part, Europeans could almost
always rely on their superior military technology

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:43.670
to coerce local rulers into doing what the
Europeans wanted. And they could replace native

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:48.560
officials with Europeans if they had to. But
in general, they preferred to rule indirectly.

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:52.620
It was easier and cheaper. Also, less malaria.
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:57.160
So while we can't know why all native princes
who ruled in the context of European imperialism

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:00.930
put up with it, we can make some pretty good
guesses. First of all, they were still rulers.

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:04.730
They got to keep their prestige and their
fancy hats, and to some extent their power.

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:08.610
Many were also able to gain advantages through
their service, like access to European education

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:12.160
for themselves and for their children. Mahatma
Gandhi, for instance, was the son of an Indian

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.300
high official, which made it possible for
him to study law in England.

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:19.070
And we can't overlook the sheer practicality
of it. The alternative was to resist, and

00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:23.510
that usually didn't work out well. I'm reminded
of the famous couplet, "Whatever happens,

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:26.420
we have got the Maxim gun, and they have not."

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:30.440
But even with this enormous technological
advantage, it wasn't always easy. For example,

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:35.820
it took 25 years, from 1845 to 1870, for the
British to fully defeat the Maori on New Zealand

00:10:35.829 --> 00:10:40.190
because the Maori were kick-ass fighters who
had mastered musketry and defensive warfare.

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:43.250
And I will remind you, it is not cursing if
you're talking about donkeys.

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:48.390
In fact, it took them being outnumbered three-to-one
with the arrival of 750,000 settlers for the

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:53.740
Maori to finally capitulate. And I will remind you that the
rule against splitting infinitives is not an actual rule.

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:57.440
Those of you more familiar with U.S. history
might notice a parallel between the Maori

00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:01.600
and some of the Native American tribes, like the
Apaches and the Lakota, a good reminder that the

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:07.080
United States did some imperial expansion of its own
as part of its nationalizing project in the 19th century.

00:11:07.089 --> 00:11:11.220
But back to Africa. Sometimes African rulers
were so good at adapting European technology

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:15.860
that they were able to successfully resist
imperialism. Ethiopia's Menelik II defeated

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:20.250
the Italians in battle, securing not just
independence but an empire of his own.

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:24.600
But embracing European-style modernization
could also be problematic, as Khedive Ismail

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:28.540
of Egypt found out during his rule in the
late 19th century. He celebrated his imperial

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:32.950
success by commissioning an opera, Giuseppe
Verdi's Aida, for the opening of the Cairo

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:37.470
Opera House in 1871. Giuseppe Verdi, by the
way -- no relation to John Green.

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:41.339
And Ismail had ambitions of extending Egypt's
control up the Nile, west toward Lake Chad.

00:11:41.339 --> 00:11:45.720
But to do that, he needed money, and that's
where he got into trouble. His borrowing bankrupted

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:49.660
Egypt and led to Britain's taking control
over the country's finances and its shares

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:54.519
in the Suez Canal that Ismail had built, with
French engineers and French capital, in 1869.

00:11:54.519 --> 00:11:58.740
The British sent in 1,300 bureaucrats to fix
Egypt's finances, an invasion of red tape

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:02.399
that led to a nationalist uprising, which
brought on a full-scale British intervention

00:12:02.399 --> 00:12:05.410
after 1881 in order to protect British interests.

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:10.230
This business imperialism, as it is sometimes
known, is really at the heart of the imperialistic

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:14.389
impulse. Industrialized nations push economic
integration upon developing nations, and then

00:12:14.389 --> 00:12:19.600
extract value from those developing nations,
just as you would from a mine or a field you owned.

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:24.040
And here we see political history and economic
history coming together again. As western

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:28.350
corporations grew in the latter part of the
19th century, their influence grew as well,

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:31.529
both in their home countries and in the lands
where they were investing.

00:12:31.529 --> 00:12:35.300
But ultimately, whether the colonizer is a
business enterprise or a political one, the

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:39.800
complicated legacy of imperialism survives.
It's why your bananas are cheap, why your

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:44.920
call centers are Indian, why your chocolate comes 
from Africa, and why everything else comes from China.

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:48.760
These imperialistic adventures may have only
lasted a century, but it was the century in

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:52.740
which the world as we know it today began
to take shape.

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:55.160
Thanks for watching. I'll see you next week.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:59.300
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller, our script supervisor is Danica Johnson,

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:03.490
the show is written by my high school history
teacher Raoul Meyer and myself, and our graphics

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:08.410
team is Thought Bubble. Oh, our intern! I'm
sorry, Meredith the Intern. Our intern is Meredith Danko.

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:12.880
Last week's Phrase of the Week was "homogeneous
mythologized unitary polity." Thank you for

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:16.310
that suggestion. If you want to guess this
week's Phrase of the Week or suggest future

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:19.370
ones, you can do so in comments, where you
can also ask questions about today's video

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:21.389
that will be answered by our team of historians.

00:13:21.389 --> 00:13:24.190
Thanks for watching Crash Course. Remember,
you can get this shirt, the Mongol shirt,

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:29.970
or our poster at dftba.com. Speaking of which, as
we say in my hometown, "Don't Forget to be Awesome."
