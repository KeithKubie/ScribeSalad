00:00:00.541 --> 00:00:04.994
- Many private universities
depend heavily on blank,

00:00:04.994 --> 00:00:07.977
the wealthy individuals who support them

00:00:07.977 --> 00:00:10.548
with gifts and bequests.

00:00:10.548 --> 00:00:12.941
So whatever blank is,
they're kind of saying

00:00:12.941 --> 00:00:15.231
well, another way of
describing blank is that

00:00:15.231 --> 00:00:17.944
they're the wealthy
individuals who support them

00:00:17.944 --> 00:00:19.556
with gifts and bequests.

00:00:19.556 --> 00:00:21.824
So which of these words are the best

00:00:21.824 --> 00:00:24.264
or best represent wealthy individuals

00:00:24.264 --> 00:00:26.824
who would support a private university

00:00:26.824 --> 00:00:28.944
with gifts and bequests?

00:00:28.944 --> 00:00:30.984
So the instructors, they
would teach at the university,

00:00:30.984 --> 00:00:33.227
but they don't tend to be wealthy,

00:00:33.227 --> 00:00:36.684
and they don't tend to
be giving large gifts

00:00:36.684 --> 00:00:37.828
or even be giving gifts at all.

00:00:37.828 --> 00:00:39.413
They take a salary from the university.

00:00:39.413 --> 00:00:42.754
So I would rule out the instructors.

00:00:42.754 --> 00:00:44.624
The administrators, well
these are the people

00:00:44.624 --> 00:00:47.604
who kind of run the
university, but once again,

00:00:47.604 --> 00:00:49.239
they don't tend to be wealthy,

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:51.984
and they don't tend to give
gifts to the university,

00:00:51.984 --> 00:00:53.273
donate money to the university.

00:00:53.273 --> 00:00:56.340
So I will rule that out.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.369
Monitors, well the monitor is
something that would mean to

00:00:58.369 --> 00:01:01.880
kind of observe something,
see what's going on.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.740
That doesn't really mean
giving to something.

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.380
So I would rule that out.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.360
Accountants, well these are the people

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.320
who take account of things.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.280
They're the ones who kind
of keep track of the books,

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.760
who keep track of the
money for any organization,

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.413
in this case maybe
university, but once again,

00:01:19.413 --> 00:01:21.020
they're not the wealthy individuals

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.465
who would support the university
with gifts and bequests.

00:01:23.465 --> 00:01:25.180
So I'd rule those out.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.340
So, I've ruled out all the choices,

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.360
so we should hope that it's
going to be benefactors,

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.820
and benefactors makes
sense, because notice,

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.521
it has the word bene.

00:01:36.521 --> 00:01:38.420
Well, you don't see
exactly the word benefit.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:39.840
You see the word benefact,

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.020
but it's really coming
from the word benefit,

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.080
and if you're benefiting someone,

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.721
that means you're doing
something for them.

00:01:45.721 --> 00:01:48.320
So a benefactor is someone
who's doing something

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.307
for, in this case, a private university.

00:01:52.307 --> 00:01:54.640
So I would definitely go with benefactors,

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.020
and you could put it back in the sentence

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.790
and see that it actually
sounds quite right.

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.781
Many private universities
depend heavily on benefactors,

00:02:02.781 --> 00:02:04.999
the wealthy individuals who support them

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:06.740
with gifts and bequests.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.661
You could almost say,
many private universities

00:02:08.661 --> 00:02:10.563
depend heavily on benefactors,

00:02:10.563 --> 00:02:13.261
the wealthy individuals who benefit them

00:02:13.261 --> 00:02:15.940
with gifts and bequests.
