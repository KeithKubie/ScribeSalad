00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.467
SO, YOU RELEASE THE ANTACID
INTO HERE.

00:00:07.467 --> 00:00:08.868
IT EXPANDS.

00:00:08.868 --> 00:00:12.167
THAT EXPANSION OF GAS PUSHES
WATER OUT OF THIS ONE INTO HERE,

00:00:12.167 --> 00:00:14.167
AND WHATEVER VOLUME
WE GET IN HERE

00:00:14.167 --> 00:00:16.667
IS HOW MUCH GAS WAS PRODUCED
BY THE ANTACID.

00:00:16.667 --> 00:00:17.901
AIN'T IT GREAT?

00:00:17.901 --> 00:00:19.601
I LOVE IT. LET'S DO IT.

00:00:19.601 --> 00:00:22.200
Narrator: THERE'S MORE THAN
ENOUGH WATER TO MAKE THIS WORK.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.200
JAMIE PULLS
THE QUICK-RELEASE MAGNET,

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.734
AND THEY'RE OFF
AND BUBBLING.

00:00:26.734 --> 00:00:29.334
LOOK AT THAT!
IT WORKS!

00:00:29.334 --> 00:00:32.334
AND THEY'VE GOT A RESULT
IN SECONDS.

00:00:32.334 --> 00:00:34.234
SO, IT LOOKS LIKE ONE PILL

00:00:34.234 --> 00:00:37.067
PRODUCES ABOUT
75 MILLILITERS OF GAS.

00:00:37.067 --> 00:00:38.534
YEAH, ABOUT 80.

00:00:38.534 --> 00:00:39.701
WELL, NOW MY QUESTION
WOULD BE,

00:00:39.701 --> 00:00:43.934
"DO TWO PILLS
DISPLACE 160 MILLILITERS?"

00:00:43.934 --> 00:00:47.567
DOES IT SCALE PERFECTLY
LINEARLY?

00:00:47.567 --> 00:00:49.567
DOUBLE THE GAS
FROM DOUBLE THE PILLS

00:00:49.567 --> 00:00:50.868
WOULD MAKE SENSE,

00:00:50.868 --> 00:00:54.067
BUT SCIENCE
IS RARELY SO SIMPLE.

00:00:54.067 --> 00:00:55.300
WOW!

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.934
THE VOLUME OF GAS PRODUCED
SCOOTS PAST THE 160 MARK

00:00:58.934 --> 00:01:00.968
AND CONTINUES TO CLIMB.

00:01:00.968 --> 00:01:03.767
THIS ONE'S LOOKING
LIKE 275.

00:01:03.767 --> 00:01:05.934
TO SEE IF
THE TREND CONTINUES,

00:01:05.934 --> 00:01:10.000
THE NEXT LOGICAL STEP
IS TO TRY FOUR PILLS.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.167
DOUBLE THE TWO-PILL RESULT

00:01:12.167 --> 00:01:15.234
WOULD BE 550 mL
OF DISPLACED WATER.

00:01:15.234 --> 00:01:17.167
AND BEFORE LONG,
JAMIE'S WISHING

00:01:17.167 --> 00:01:18.934
HE'D BROUGHT
A BIGGER BEAKER.

00:01:18.934 --> 00:01:20.734
IT'S ACTUALLY GOING
MORE THAN --

00:01:20.734 --> 00:01:21.734
MORE THAN DOUBLE.

00:01:21.734 --> 00:01:24.467
IT'S CLEAR
THERE'S CO2 A-PLENTY.

00:01:24.467 --> 00:01:26.300
BUT THE MYTH
DEPENDS SPECIFICALLY

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.200
ON THE PRESSURE
THE GAS GENERATES,

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.434
SO THAT'S WHAT
THEY'LL MEASURE NEXT.

00:01:30.434 --> 00:01:33.801
TESTING PRESSURE
IN THREE, TWO, ONE.

00:01:35.968 --> 00:01:37.267
OH, LOOK AT THAT.

00:01:37.267 --> 00:01:39.734
THEY START OVER
WITH ONE TABLET,

00:01:39.734 --> 00:01:42.400
AND AGAIN, THE RESULTS
COME QUICKLY.

00:01:43.834 --> 00:01:46.033
WHAT ARE WE GETTING HERE?
1.9? 2 PSI?

00:01:46.033 --> 00:01:49.400
YEAH, THAT'S ABOUT 1.9 --
JUST A HAIR UNDER 2.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.934
NOW FOR
A MINI MOMENT OF TRUTH.

00:01:51.934 --> 00:01:56.133
TO SEE IF PRESSURE, LIKE VOLUME,
INCREASES EXPONENTIALLY.

00:01:56.133 --> 00:01:57.167
ALL RIGHT.

00:01:57.167 --> 00:01:59.267
TWO TABLET PRESSURE TEST.

00:01:59.267 --> 00:02:01.734
IF THE PRESSURE
JUST DOUBLES,

00:02:01.734 --> 00:02:04.667
THE TWO TABS
WILL FIZZLE AT 4 PSI.

00:02:04.667 --> 00:02:07.601
BOTH PILLS ARE STILL GOING.
BOTH TABLETS ARE STILL BUBBLING.

00:02:07.601 --> 00:02:10.501
2 PSI IS ROUNDLY PASSED.
2 1/2 PSI IS ON ITS WAY.

00:02:10.501 --> 00:02:13.300
2 1/2 PSI HANDILY PASSED
BY BOTH TABLETS,

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.434
AND NOW ROUNDING UP
ON 3 PSI.

00:02:15.434 --> 00:02:17.567
3 PSI.
WILL WE GET 3 1/2 PSI?

00:02:17.567 --> 00:02:18.834
3 1/2?
ANYONE FOR 3 1/2?

00:02:18.834 --> 00:02:21.734
YES! BOTH PILLS SEEM
TO WANT TO GO TO 3 1/2 PSI.

00:02:21.734 --> 00:02:23.701
ON OUR WAY TO 4.
4 PSI. 4 PSI.

00:02:23.701 --> 00:02:26.033
GO! GO! YES!

00:02:26.033 --> 00:02:27.868
PASSING 4 PSI,
THE EXPECTED

00:02:27.868 --> 00:02:30.434
LINEAR EXPANSION RATE
OF THE TWO TABLETS,

00:02:30.434 --> 00:02:32.033
AND IT SEEMS THAT
THEIR EXPANSION RATE

00:02:32.033 --> 00:02:34.133
IS, IN FACT,
EXPONENTIAL.
