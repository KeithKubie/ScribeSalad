00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:02.267
- [Voiceover] We know that the derivative

00:00:02.267 --> 00:00:06.583
with respect to x,of e to the x, is equal

00:00:06.583 --> 00:00:08.606
to e to the x, which I think is one

00:00:08.606 --> 00:00:11.403
of the neatest things in mathematics.

00:00:11.403 --> 00:00:14.587
It just builds my
respect for the number e.

00:00:14.587 --> 00:00:18.008
But that's not what we're
here to do, to just praise e.

00:00:18.008 --> 00:00:19.281
What we really want to think about is,

00:00:19.281 --> 00:00:21.282
what's the derivative
of the inverse function?

00:00:21.282 --> 00:00:22.878
What's the derivative, with respect

00:00:22.878 --> 00:00:27.673
to x, of the natural log of x?

00:00:27.673 --> 00:00:29.588
We've done this several
times, where we know

00:00:29.588 --> 00:00:31.196
the derivative of a
function and we now want

00:00:31.196 --> 00:00:33.499
to find the derivative
of the inverse function.

00:00:33.499 --> 00:00:36.267
What we can do, let's say y is

00:00:36.267 --> 00:00:39.538
equal to the natural log of x.

00:00:39.538 --> 00:00:41.255
This is another way of saying that y

00:00:41.255 --> 00:00:45.162
is the power that we
raise e to, to get to x.

00:00:45.162 --> 00:00:47.991
So, this is equivalent to saying that e

00:00:47.991 --> 00:00:52.130
to the y power is equal to x.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.890
Now we can take the derivative of both

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.195
sides of this equation with respect to x.

00:00:58.195 --> 00:00:59.713
So let's do that.

00:00:59.713 --> 00:01:01.883
The derivative of both sides with respect

00:01:01.883 --> 00:01:04.748
to x, do a little bit of
implicit differentiation.

00:01:04.748 --> 00:01:07.595
Really just an application
of the chain rule.

00:01:07.595 --> 00:01:11.634
So, on the left-hand side right over here,

00:01:11.634 --> 00:01:13.640
this is going to be the
derivative of e to the y

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.656
with respect to y, which is
just going to be e to the y

00:01:17.656 --> 00:01:21.819
times the derivative
of y with respect to x.

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:23.524
On the right hand side
here, the derivative

00:01:23.524 --> 00:01:26.797
of x with respect to x is one.

00:01:26.797 --> 00:01:29.015
Now, to solve for the derivative,

00:01:29.015 --> 00:01:32.253
we just divide both sides by e to the y.

00:01:32.253 --> 00:01:35.615
We get the derivative of y with respect

00:01:35.615 --> 00:01:40.615
to x is equal to one
over e to the y power.

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.738
Now, what is y equal to?

00:01:49.738 --> 00:01:54.617
Well, we know that y is equal
to the natural log of x.

00:01:54.617 --> 00:01:55.748
So let's write that down.

00:01:55.748 --> 00:02:00.748
This is equal to one over
e to the natural log of x.

00:02:07.339 --> 00:02:11.347
What is e to the natural
log of x going to be?

00:02:12.541 --> 00:02:14.300
The natural log of x is the power

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.584
I need to raise e to, to get to x.

00:02:16.584 --> 00:02:18.617
So if I actually raise e to that power,

00:02:18.617 --> 00:02:21.063
to that exponent, I'm going to get x.

00:02:21.063 --> 00:02:26.063
This is going to be equal to one over x.

00:02:29.701 --> 00:02:32.552
So this thing simplifies to x.

00:02:32.552 --> 00:02:33.464
We are done.

00:02:33.464 --> 00:02:35.060
We just figured out if y is equal

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.774
to the natural log of x, the derivative

00:02:36.774 --> 00:02:39.362
of y with respect to x is one over x.

00:02:39.362 --> 00:02:41.308
Or you could say the
derivative of the natural log

00:02:41.308 --> 00:02:46.308
of x with respect to x
is equal to one over x.

00:02:46.817 --> 00:02:49.417
So this is equal to, this right

00:02:49.417 --> 00:02:54.417
over here, is equal to one over x.

00:02:56.138 --> 00:02:59.058
One over x, which is also a pretty

00:02:59.058 --> 00:03:02.886
neat result in mathematics.

00:03:02.886 --> 00:03:06.760
Not quite as exciting as this
one, but still pretty neat.
