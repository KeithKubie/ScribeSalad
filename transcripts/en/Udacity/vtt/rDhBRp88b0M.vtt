00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.813
&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Eric Durand. I'm a

00:00:01.813 --> 00:00:05.509
computational biologist here at 23andMe. I've been with

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:08.730
the company for about two years now. And

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.370
I'm mostly working on their ancestry products which

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:19.550
range from a variety of different problems. before that, I was a post-doc at UC

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.100
Berkeley for another two years and even before

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.020
that I was a PhD student in France.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.388
&gt;&gt; We really want

00:00:25.388 --> 00:00:28.540
to know from a computational biologist is, how

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.351
do you determine IBD, or identity by descent.

00:00:32.351 --> 00:00:36.218
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so first maybe we should define exactly what IBD, or

00:00:36.218 --> 00:00:39.910
identity by descent, is. So, IBD is something that refers to a

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:45.550
chunk of continuous DNA and we say that two individuals share a chunk

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.580
of DNA identical by descent if this chunk has been inherited through

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.110
a common ancestor without recombination. It means that

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.500
you inherited these segments from the common ancestor however

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.100
far back it was in the past and

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.180
it was never broken by a recombination event during

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.990
meiosis. So if you want the simplest example

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.720
of, of identity by descent maybe is between a

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.300
parent and his child, where because of the way,

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.420
if I refer you back to high school biology,

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.830
because of the way chromosomes are inherited a child will inherit one chromosome

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.130
exactly from each of his parents. And so a child is 50% identical by

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.660
descent with his parent. And he is, in this case a common ancestor

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.220
is the parent, himself. And the child is 50% IBD with, with the parent.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.900
&gt;&gt; And so it doesn't matter how big the segment is.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.060
The segment could be the whole length of the chromosome itself or

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.280
anything shorter than that.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.060
&gt;&gt; Exactly. So if you only look one generation back in time the, the

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.380
segment will cover a full chromosome in the child. So, full chromosome in the

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.200
child will be identical by descent with his parent. If you go one more

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.064
generation with, with a child is about

00:01:59.064 --> 00:02:02.470
25% IBD with each of his four grandparents.

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:02.530
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.080
&gt;&gt; But there already, the 25% is only approximate and it can vary.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.680
You can be more IBD, you can share more IBD with

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.770
one grandparent than with another, just because of the way recombination occurs.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.860
&gt;&gt; I see. So, there may be an average

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.680
an average IBD but it doesn't have to be exact because, like

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.960
you said, the recombination doesn't happen in the same place every time.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:32.720
&gt;&gt; Exactly. And also because of our ability to detect it, there is some error,

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.340
some statistical error around the estimation of IBD, which in the end will lead

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.530
to slightly different estimate. But it should

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.820
be pretty close to 25%. And the further

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.080
back you go in time and the

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.600
more variation you have between those percentages and

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.330
also the shorter the segments become and the harder

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.524
they become to, to detect. So if you want to

00:02:53.524 --> 00:02:57.424
relate IBD and IBS for example, the main diff, difficulty

00:02:57.424 --> 00:03:00.950
with IBD I guess it's two-fold. It's first, we do

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.040
not observe the recombination process. It would be great if

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.810
we had that in some kind of black box or,

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.898
or records that tells us where this is where recombination

00:03:08.898 --> 00:03:12.740
occurs but we, we don't see that. And even worse

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.260
we don't even know the genealogy that

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.800
relates to individuals even if they're kind

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.859
of closely related. Their second cousin most

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:23.708
people just ignore the tree that connects them.

00:03:23.708 --> 00:03:24.296
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:03:24.296 --> 00:03:26.160
&gt;&gt; So you don't know how far back in

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.660
time they were connected and you don't where recombination occurs.

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.110
so, the main problem is that you cannot

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.440
observe IBD directly from the data, you can

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.690
only observe a proxy of IBD, which is

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.760
IBS, identity by state. You can definitely detect

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.120
segments between individuals that are identical or roughly identical.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.130
And so this is how an IBD algorithm works. We start by

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:57.020
scanning the chromosomes and finding long segments of IBS, and that

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:02.070
gives us some kind of candidate pool of IBD segments. And then we apply

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:07.650
various filters from these sets to extract the IBD segments.

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:08.335
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:04:08.335 --> 00:04:11.310
&gt;&gt; And whose filters are varied, they depend on the

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.310
length of the segments, meaning that it's pretty unlikely to

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.839
have a very long IBS segment that was not generated

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:22.040
by a common ancestor. We have, we also apply a

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.170
filter for the frequency of the segment that

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:27.490
was inherited. If the segment is very, very

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.929
frequent in the population maybe it's not IB,

00:04:29.929 --> 00:04:33.520
it's not IBD, it's just IBS, and that

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.960
arose to, to being fixed in the population

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.620
because maybe of natural selection or other, other

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.450
reasons. So frequency, quality of the segment, if

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.950
it contains many mutations then it's unlikely to

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.770
be IBD. We have a lot of

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:49.510
[UNKNOWN]

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:54.540
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it sounds like you really have to think a lot around how to make

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.230
sure that it's a true identity by descent

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.950
and not like you say, either coincidental or something

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:02.770
else. so let me make sure I even

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.385
understand this. the smaller the segment that, the smaller

00:05:07.385 --> 00:05:11.470
the segment that appears to be commonly shared

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.985
the more likely it could be that it's just,

00:05:14.985 --> 00:05:18.215
you know, a match of identity by state,

00:05:18.215 --> 00:05:22.340
by chance with someone random in the population.

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.100
&gt;&gt; That's correct. So maybe I should

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.660
clarify the definition of IBD a little bit

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.080
because under the definition I gave actually

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.760
everyone is IBD everywhere, just because we all

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.358
have a common ancestry if you go far enough back in time. So when we

00:05:35.358 --> 00:05:37.914
talk about IBD we usually restrict ourself

00:05:37.914 --> 00:05:40.399
to the recent past, say, I don't know,

00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:46.032
a few tens of generations, maybe a thousand years. And what, what's

00:05:46.032 --> 00:05:50.860
beyond this point we, we're, we just don't have

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:55.050
the power to decide anymore if it's IBD or not. But

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.060
if you go, if you look small enough, everyone's IBD everywhere.
