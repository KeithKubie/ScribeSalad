00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.774
Remember how we talked about actually writing code to do intersection between

00:00:03.774 --> 00:00:07.759
two rectangles? We've actually abstracted that away and actually turned it into

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:11.401
a function inside of gMaps. You can call gMap.intersectRect. The isVisible

00:00:11.401 --> 00:00:15.163
function is actually a nice little helper that will pass in the viewRect and the

00:00:15.163 --> 00:00:19.039
rectangle for this tile Into the intersectRect function to determine whether or

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.861
not this tile is visible to the current view rectangle. This is a helpful little

00:00:22.861 --> 00:00:26.568
function that we'll utilize in a couple different places moving forward. Now,

00:00:26.568 --> 00:00:30.198
before moving forward let's go ahead and write this intersectRect function so

00:00:30.198 --> 00:00:33.553
that it takes two rectangles with top, bottom, left, and right values and

00:00:33.553 --> 00:00:35.523
returns whether or not they intersect.
