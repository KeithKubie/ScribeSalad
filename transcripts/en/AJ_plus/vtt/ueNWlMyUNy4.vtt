00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.700
I think that if women and children are appearing at the United States-Mexico border,

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.300
we can pretty much surmise that there is no place left for them to go.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:24.020
The sounds you just heard have come to signify one of the darkest moments in recent American history.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.160
But it’s a story that has roots that go back almost 40 years. The Central American immigrant population

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:37.260
in the United States  has increased more than tenfold since 1980, in no small part because of US intervention in that region.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.560
Central American communities became the focus of the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance”

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.800
policy towards people crossing the Mexico-U.S. border in the spring of 2018.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.860
The policy, introduced and enforced by Attorney General Jeff Sessions,

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.020
arrested any and all people caught crossing - prosecuting them immediately.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.540
The most controversial aspect of the policy was the forced separation of children of all ages,

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.120
from their parents - and their subsequent detention in what some have called concentration camps.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.000
But what’s been missing from the conversation and coverage has been one simple question:

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.080
why are these families even coming here?

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.980
On the one hand you're creating conditions that make this place unlivable and on the other hand,

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:21.740
you're not recognizing that the conditions are unlivable and you're claiming that people don't have a right to be here.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.880
We did not let them into this country even though we had a hand in fueling the civil unrest.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.960
Hey guys, I’m Sana, and this Sunday, I’m going to be exploring how decades of U.S. intervention

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.920
in Central America has forced thousands of families to flee for the Mexico-U.S. border today.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.260
The history of U.S. intervention and involvement in Central America is a story of destabilization, bloodshed

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.260
and a vicious cycle of the export of violence and control over resources.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:58.320
Leisy Abrego, an associate professor at UCLA who focuses on Central American immigration talks a bit more about that.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:05.920
The relationship between the U.S. and Central America is a long and rather complex one that started

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:15.040
from the time that the U.S. became a nation, wanting to make sure that other major political powers were not

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.720
stepping into what they consider to be part of their territory to some extent.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.720
Now, we’re going to talk about the Sandinistas, civil wars, CIA-backed death squads, MS-13 -- but first, some context.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.600
The United States’ history of occupation and intervention in Latin America spans almost 200 years.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.500
From Cuba to Haiti to Venezuela to Chile to Panama to Nicaragua - the United States was there.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.780
President James Monroe in 1823 declared all of Latin America to be a U.S. sphere of influence.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.240
Under the Monroe Doctrine, Washington claimed the right to intervene militarily across the continent.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:55.000
That led to the ‘Banana Wars,’ in which the United States military fought to reassert American power and

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.920
monopoly of plantations in Central America, Mexico and the Caribbean.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.980
Land in Central America was pretty fertile.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.120
And there were a lot of U.S. corporations that had established businesses there and those interests were constantly protected.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:14.980
Those business folks had an ear at the U.S. government so that any time that there were attempts

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:23.460
in the region to try and level some of the inequalities there, the U.S. government would step in.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:29.180
There were coups; there was military intervention throughout the 1900s.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:36.080
The U.S. invasion of Nicaragua in particular, as a part of those Banana Wars, would lead to a 21-year-long American occupation.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:44.420
The U.S. occupation of Nicaragua came to an end when the Great Depression and a rebellion led by Augusto Nicolás Calderón Sandino forced them to withdraw.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.200
Sandino was a revolutionary, who is still celebrated in Nicaragua today.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.540
He was assassinated in 1934 by the U.S.-trained National Guard, led by General Anastasio Somoza Garcia

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.720
who led a U.S.-backed coup d’état two years later.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:03.340
It’s one of many coups across Latin America that’s characterized U.S. foreign policy in the region since the early 20th century.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.800
Somoza and his family would continue to rule Nicaragua, under a brutal dictatorship, for the next 40 years.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.720
Sandino’s revolutionary legacy, however, was adopted by a left-leaning Sandinista Front,

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.680
who would become the greatest opposition to the dictatorship - but I'll get back to them in just a minute.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:26.940
Throughout this period - the 1930s, the 40s, the 50s - there’s a lot of U.S. meddling in Latin America, in Central America in particular, that’s happening.

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:33.000
And this history is about to get a little complicated, but it shows the intersection of U.S. foreign policy towards Central America

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.080
at the height of the Cold War and the spread of Leftist movements and revolutions.

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.580
The success of the Cuban revolution made the U.S. nervous to think that there could be political

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:49.880
superpowers, like the USSR at the time, getting involved in what they perceive as their backyard.

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:55.620
All of this set the stage for a sustained and violent U.S. intervention across Central America during the 1980s -

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:01.920
backing vicious local allies in wars that claimed hundreds of thousands of lives, displaced millions,

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:07.260
and set in motion the social breakdown that today forces many thousands to flee north.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:15.440
The way that the U.S. trained those soldiers and tactics like extreme torture and scorched earth tactics that were

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:21.720
really meant to instill fear in a widespread way throughout those populations.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.980
That's what caused, for the first time, people to flee in mass numbers.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.580
First, let's start with Guatemala.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:33.060
From 1960 to 1996, Guatemala experienced the longest civil war in Central America.

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.200
It was fought between a U.S.-installed military dictatorship and leftist groups.

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:42.100
True to its commitment to fighting Communism at all costs, the CIA provided intelligence, training

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.120
and arms support to the Guatemalan government throughout the war.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:51.100
I also want to mention here that Guatemala was ruled by a right-wing military government -  one of many since a

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:56.740
1954 U.S.-backed coup that ousted a democratically elected Leftist president.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:01.880
The war claimed over 200,000 lives, with 83% of them being indigenous Mayan people -

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.620
people who lived mainly in rural areas and were accused of being Communist supporters.

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:13.220
Over half a million people were displaced and over 40,000 were “disappeared” — mostly as a result of government actions.

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.780
Then there was Nicaragua and the Sandinistas.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:22.500
The early 80s saw a wave of Leftist, Cuban-Soviet aligned movements vying for power in Nicaragua and El Salvador.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:29.760
The Sandinista National Liberation Front was founded in 1961 - they’re a far-left revolutionary group that was opposed to the Somoza government.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:35.360
In 1979, they overthrew the Somoza dictatorship, and two years later they consolidated power with other Leftist groups.

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:40.600
Prior to the Somoza government's fall, President Jimmy Carter actually started a covert policy of supporting a

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:46.480
more, what the U.S. called, “moderate opposition” to the government, as an alternative to the far left opposition.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:51.920
It was a policy that both he and his successor, Ronald Reagan, also pursued in El Salvador when civil war broke

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:57.120
out between the U.S.- backed military junta and the FMLN, a coalition of Leftist groups.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:02.820
"Central America’s problems do directly effect the security and the well-being of our own people.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:09.380
And Central America is much closer to the United States than many of the world’s troubled spots that concern us."

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:15.180
Reagan invested heavily in an effort to roll back this leftwing tide by arming, training and supporting

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:19.780
government forces and Death Squads in El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala,

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:21.400
and the rebel “Contras” in Nicaragua.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:26.160
The purpose of the Contras, the Death Squads, was to fight against Marxist groups vying for

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.620
power and to scare people away from supporting these groups.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:36.420
"Will we permit the Soviet Union to put a second Cuba, a second Libya - right at the doorstep of the United States?"

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:41.180
This was a policy of making sure that communism would not spread throughout the world.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:53.300
We basically gave arms, munitions, war implements, money to one side of a civil unrest to try and stamp out communism, for the most part.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:08:00.800
At least that was our goal. At least that's what was stated. There was a slaughter. People lost their lives, people lost their livelihoods.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:08.880
The Salvadoran Civil War, which lasted 12 years, claimed over 75,000 lives and more than a quarter of the population was displaced.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:14.200
According to a United Nations Truth Commission, 85% of the violence was attributed to the U.S.-backed

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.180
government and death squads - and 5% to the FMLN.

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:21.280
Back in Nicaragua, the United States spent over $1 billion on the Contras --

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:25.680
with Reagan calling them the equivalent of the Founding Fathers of the United States.

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:29.400
The U.S. also used Honduras as a base for attacks against the Sandinistas.

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:35.060
In fact, the U.S. helped transport Honduran troops into Nicaragua and even deployed its own soldiers

00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:36.840
into Honduras to assist.

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:45.120
So the U.S. escalated a series of local political conflicts throughout the 1980s into a series of connected wars that devastated Central America

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:51.040
which had started before the eighties and intensified during that decade – creating massive social and economic breakdown,

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:54.900
and human displacement. We’re still feeling  the impact of those wars today.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:59.900
Almost 1 million Nicaraguans, Salvadorans, Hondurans and Guatemalans fled to the United States between

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:04.500
1980 and 1991 to escape political repression and economic hardship.

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:11.900
People fled to the United States. Los Angeles was a hotbed that received 70,000 immigrants during the 80s seeking asylum.

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:15.800
We did not let them into this country even though we had a hand in fueling the civil unrest.

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:23.320
And that led to traumatized communities in the United States, with no mental health recourse and resources, fending for themselves.

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:30.680
Not having refugee status, not being able to apply for asylum because the vast majority of asylum applications

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:36.280
were denied at the time. They were here and they were undocumented and they had to work two, three jobs to survive.

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:47.980
So gangs arose in this country, in L.A. in particular, as a way to find support to survive the communities they were living in.

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:54.080
That led to all kinds of activity that put them in prison and then later in deportation.

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:59.320
And the point Abrego makes about gangs is an important one in understanding the gang violence that

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:04.720
Central Americans are fleeing and how that’s connected to the refugees and migrants at the Mexico-U.S. border.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:10.440
Bill Clinton’s 1996 immigration reform act expanded the criteria for who was deportable to include

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:14.080
green card holders and immigrants who had committed a crime or anyone in a gang.

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:21.360
So we deported 50,000 criminals from our jails to El Salvador; to a country that had no law enforcement

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:27.820
or a new law enforcement structure. It had just come through a civil war and those gangs easily reconstituted in El Salvador.

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:33.360
They became very powerful, and now they're basically fighting with a local government to rule the country.

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:39.200
So MS-13 was generated in the United States, sent back to a country that couldn't handle the criminal element,

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:45.660
and now they've actually grown stronger. So we have a large responsibility in playing a part in MS-13.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.740
It's not just coming from Central America.

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:53.360
And it’s not as though the United States stopped intervening in Central America once the civil wars came to an end.

00:10:53.660 --> 00:11:00.560
In 2009, a military coup - approved by the Honduran Supreme Court - ousted democratically elected, Leftist president Manuel Zelaya.

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:05.260
While President Barack Obama condemned the coup - then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton advised

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:10.580
that the U.S. not brand it as such since doing so would force the U.S. to cease all aid to Honduras.

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:15.860
The result? A legitimized coup, an ousted democratic leader and increased instability and violence.

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:20.480
In fact, homicides in Honduras increased by 50% in just three years.

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.380
The coup, notably, also led to crackdowns on activists -

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:29.060
most famously the murder of Berta Cáceres, an award-winning indigenous environmental activist.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:33.360
And under the Trump administration, there have been efforts to significantly scale back aid to

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.620
Latin America, with big cuts to aid to Central America.

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:40.700
Instead, efforts have turned towards increasing securitization funding.

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:45.520
So, with almost 200 years of American economic and military involvement in Central America -

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:48.800
does the United States have a moral responsibility towards the people?

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:56.480
The U.S. has a responsibility, a moral one, to provide the kinds of resources that would stabilize the region,

00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:01.340
that it has destabilized so many times throughout the region's history.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:08.020
We're dealing with it from a military perspective. Build a wall, put more boots on the ground, incarcerate people.

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:12.600
We're not dealing with the root causes of migration. We're not touching the root causes of migration.

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:18.380
Desperate people will continue to come. They will scale the wall, they will use organized crime to get across.

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:23.880
They're desperate. They have no other choice but to fight the system that we're putting them up against.
