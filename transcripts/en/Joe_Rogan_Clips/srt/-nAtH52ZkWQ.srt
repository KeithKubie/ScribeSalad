1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,010
It's not simply a perspective enhancer,
it changes how you,

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:08,220
your body and your brain deal with,
with opiates.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,890
I think a Tim Ferriss actually
talked about that before as well. Um,

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:17,520
but I mean, you know, I've seen it in my
practice and there are medical studies,

5
00:00:17,521 --> 00:00:20,880
so I don't think that we should throw
out the fact that, um, you know,

6
00:00:20,881 --> 00:00:24,690
cannabis can can help the opioid
crisis. And then also too, you know,

7
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,810
you want to look at it from a
clinical perspective, right?

8
00:00:27,811 --> 00:00:31,850
So we know that opioids can kill people,
right? Cause it acts on the brainstem,

9
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:36,150
whereas whereas cannabis doesn't, so,
you know, you might be saying, you know,

10
00:00:36,151 --> 00:00:40,620
you're just substituting
one for the other. And you
know, sometimes that is true,

11
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:43,980
but if you're using a less
harmful substance, you know,

12
00:00:43,981 --> 00:00:47,670
to me that's like a huge win.
Right? So if someone you know,

13
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,680
has to drink 12 beers a night
versus smoking like one joint,

14
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,280
man, that's, that's awesome. I mean,
you look at all, all these clinics,

15
00:00:56,281 --> 00:00:59,250
like you look at like Methadone clinics.
I mean, what are they doing there?

16
00:00:59,251 --> 00:01:02,310
They're trying to get people
off one substance to, you know,

17
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,420
a substance that is a little bit less
harmful. And I think that when you,

18
00:01:06,421 --> 00:01:10,290
when you use cannabis, you know, it
can be effective, uh, for, for opioids.

19
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,250
It can also be affected for,
for benzodiazepines and for
other medicines as well.

20
00:01:14,251 --> 00:01:18,390
So, you know, I would be awesome
if everyone would just, you know,

21
00:01:18,391 --> 00:01:23,130
feel happy and great all the time by just
exercise and nutrition and, you know,

22
00:01:23,131 --> 00:01:26,310
that's what I advocate and that's
what I try to do personally.

23
00:01:26,311 --> 00:01:29,670
And that's what I try to, you know,
say to my patients all the time.

24
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:34,790
But I understand though that,
you know, sometimes life is
hard. Sometimes, you know,

25
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,400
things hit you, you know, you
have, you have crisis in your
life, you have, you know,

26
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:41,580
personal crisis that can throw off
your mental health and then you have,

27
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:45,690
you get into a car accident, you know,
and you could be in really severe pain.

28
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:50,010
And in those times, you know,
sometimes diet, exercise,

29
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:55,020
meditation, doing all the right
things just isn't quite enough. And,

30
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:55,291
you know,

31
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:59,760
I think that it's great that we have
cannabis for those situations because it

32
00:01:59,761 --> 00:02:04,761
does seem to be very effective and has
less side effects compared to some of the

33
00:02:05,251 --> 00:02:08,790
other metals as compared to some
of the other medicines that we have

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,060
traditionally used. Um, and you
know, even though, you know,

35
00:02:12,061 --> 00:02:16,630
I'm talking about opiates and deaths,
you know, we can also talk about insets,

36
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,860
right? Like nonsteroidal antiinflammatory
drugs. So, you know, the,

37
00:02:19,861 --> 00:02:23,970
these drugs can also, you know,
wreck havoc under GI system. Um,

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,980
I saw one study, actually, I tweeted
out, uh, uh, Rhonda Patrick tweeted out,

39
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:32,310
said that if you use a and sets, it was
really short. I gotta look it up again,

40
00:02:32,311 --> 00:02:36,150
but it was like two weeks. It can
decrease your, uh, your gonadotropins,

41
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,450
which can stimulate your,
your testosterone level by like 25%.

42
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,650
And on that note too,
we should talk about,

43
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:46,410
I can't believe I forgot to talk with
this, but opiates can drastically, um,

44
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,380
inhibit your, uh, your, uh,
testosterone production. Right?

45
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,540
Which is a huge thing for
depression because I've had
guys come in to me before,

46
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:57,480
um, that have been, uh, you
know, really, really depressed.

47
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,430
You just give them a small amount of
testosterone, a man, their author,

48
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:04,210
antidepressants, and they're off to the
races. They're doing great. So, you know,

49
00:03:04,211 --> 00:03:06,460
are we creating a lot of people who are,

50
00:03:06,461 --> 00:03:10,810
who are depressed because they're using
opiates and their testosterone levels

51
00:03:10,811 --> 00:03:14,680
are low. And you know, for men, I mean
having low testosterone is horrible.

52
00:03:14,681 --> 00:03:18,670
You know, your libido goes, you know what,
you're going to have low motivation. Um,

53
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,700
you know, you're not gonna feel as well.
You're not gonna want to do things. So,

54
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,800
you know, um, if you're giving someone
a medicine that, that, that nails there,

55
00:03:25,801 --> 00:03:30,040
their testosterone levels down, that's
gonna really, you know, wreck wreck,

56
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:31,330
wreck havoc on their mental health.

57
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:35,860
And I just want to make a note to cause
Ben Greenfield who again, I really,

58
00:03:35,861 --> 00:03:38,560
really respect. I like that
guy a lot. Um, you know,

59
00:03:38,561 --> 00:03:43,030
it was talking a little bit with you
about testosterone and um, and uh,

60
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,430
and cannabis and how it can drop it.
So,

61
00:03:45,431 --> 00:03:49,990
I think there was three studies
I saw done on humans. Um,

62
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:51,970
and two of them,
uh,

63
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:57,030
noted no statistical difference and drop
into testosterone levels and one study,

64
00:03:57,491 --> 00:04:02,140
the other study noted a small
statistical difference. Um, so, you know,

65
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:06,100
I think that it may drop your
testosterone levels a little bit,

66
00:04:06,101 --> 00:04:10,150
but it's not gonna you know,
substantially, um, drop
them. So just so people,

67
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:14,410
people know that because I know that
comes up all the time, you know?

68
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,430
Oh yes. As the, as the,

69
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:19,970
as the dumb anti drug advocates
like to say doobies cause boobies.

70
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,320
Oh yeah, that is, that
is, that is not right.

71
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:29,330
There was no [inaudible] no,

72
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:35,070
I'm joking. Um, risperdol
causes, that's a different issue.

73
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,260
Um, respire Dawson anti psychotic,
the spirit of, yeah, so, so look,

74
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:45,300
I think, I think the issue of
whether cannabis is a gateway drug,

75
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:49,290
it's 100% clear that
cannabis is a gateway drug.

76
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,240
The argument is when you say it's 100%
clear, the argument is why. Okay. So,

77
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:59,570
so it's quite clear that cannabis use
oftentimes proceeds other drug use,

78
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:03,990
whether it's opioids, cocaine,
other drugs. Now, one argument,

79
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,970
and this is actually a
pro legalization argument,

80
00:05:05,971 --> 00:05:10,380
is one reason it's a gateway
is that if it's illegal,

81
00:05:10,381 --> 00:05:12,420
you got to buy it from your
friendly neighborhood dealer.

82
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,630
He might have access to heroin or cocaine,
other drugs,

83
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,290
and so eventually maybe you decide
to try one of those other drugs.

84
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:21,160
So actually that's really
why the Dutch legalized.

85
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:25,560
They wanted to create an avenue for people
to use cannabis that wasn't connected

86
00:05:25,561 --> 00:05:27,330
to other drugs.
Okay.

87
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:31,380
Another possibility is that using
an addictive intoxicating substance,

88
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,630
you might like it and you might
want to try other addictive,

89
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:37,050
intoxicating substances and
it might prime your brain.

90
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,440
And then the third possibility
really is that they're just,

91
00:05:40,441 --> 00:05:42,690
some people are risk takers
out there, right? They use,

92
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,450
they're going to use cannabis, they're
going to gamble, they're going to end.

93
00:05:45,451 --> 00:05:48,780
Cannabis is a little bit easier
to access than other drugs.

94
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:50,820
So they're probably going
to try cannabis first.

95
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:54,150
So it's not really that that
cannabis drives the use,

96
00:05:54,151 --> 00:05:56,700
it's just the cannabis is first.
They're just curious people.

97
00:05:56,701 --> 00:05:59,420
But your thoughts on what I would say,

98
00:05:59,421 --> 00:06:02,390
I mean I'm just going to go back to
the NAM report. Right? And I mean,

99
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:06,140
I mean you quote these people
in your book, um, you know,

100
00:06:06,141 --> 00:06:10,250
so this committee couldn't find sufficient
data demonstrating an association

101
00:06:10,251 --> 00:06:12,470
between cannabis use initially opioid use.

102
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:16,390
They found no compelling evidence to
support the gateway drug theory. So,

103
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:20,210
so again, but that's most of the
people that you quoted in your book.

104
00:06:20,211 --> 00:06:24,770
So there's been more research done since
then, but things have radically changed.

105
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,110
I would say things have
changed some, here's, here's,

106
00:06:27,111 --> 00:06:27,980
here's what I would probably say.

107
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:31,040
I think that probably it's a combination
of these things, right? It's,

108
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,290
there's certainly an
environmental factor where again,

109
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:36,830
if you're buying from somebody who's
got an access to other illegal drugs,

110
00:06:36,831 --> 00:06:40,730
maybe you try those drugs at
the same time getting high,

111
00:06:40,731 --> 00:06:44,120
it feels good and maybe you want to try
other drugs and at the same time you're

112
00:06:44,121 --> 00:06:46,340
just a risk taker. Okay. What is,

113
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:51,670
what nobody seriously ever said until
about the last five years is that cannabis

114
00:06:51,921 --> 00:06:54,260
could be an off ramp for opioids.
Okay.

115
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,070
And there's a lot of reasons to believe
that's a really bad idea. First of all,

116
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:00,560
cannabis, if you actually
need opioids for pain relief,

117
00:07:00,561 --> 00:07:03,260
cannabis is not a good enough
pain reliever. It's like alcohol.

118
00:07:03,261 --> 00:07:06,830
It's a mild pain reliever. It's not
strong enough. You're dying from cancer.

119
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:11,630
Cannabis probably is not the pain reliever
that you need. You need opioids. Okay.

120
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:15,320
And again,
the state level data is not as good.

121
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:18,680
If you want to really figure out
what's happening to an individual,

122
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:21,500
the best way to do that is
to follow that individual.

123
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,320
And there's a really good paper that
came out in 2017 after the NAM reports,

124
00:07:25,321 --> 00:07:26,300
so they didn't have it.

125
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:31,750
That shows that people who use cannabis
in 2001 is based on a large national

126
00:07:32,511 --> 00:07:37,511
study in the U S we're three times as
likely to be using opioids three years

127
00:07:37,851 --> 00:07:40,670
later. Okay. And that just
intuitively makes sense to me.

128
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,980
And the other thing that
people on the legalization,

129
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:47,420
I don't ever talk about is who are the
two countries that have the most cannabis

130
00:07:47,421 --> 00:07:49,760
use in the west,
the US and Canada.

131
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,570
We're the two who are the two countries
that have by far the worst opiod

132
00:07:53,571 --> 00:07:55,820
epidemic, the U S and Canada. Okay.

133
00:07:55,821 --> 00:07:58,730
But there's a real issue with that
because the United States is also the only

134
00:07:58,731 --> 00:08:02,900
country other than New Zealand that
allows pharmaceutical companies advertise.

135
00:08:02,901 --> 00:08:05,660
I mean there's a,
there's Canada doesn't,

136
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:08,630
the amount of opiates that are
prescribed the United States is fucking

137
00:08:08,631 --> 00:08:11,240
preposterous. I agree.
Particularly the, if the,

138
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,760
I don't know if you ever saw the
documentary, the Oxycontin Express,

139
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:16,880
but the way Florida used to be structured
where they didn't have a database,

140
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,330
you could just literally go
from pharmacy to pharmacy.

141
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:24,260
Yet we have a problem with the way
we prescribe drugs in this country.

142
00:08:24,261 --> 00:08:28,680
Opioids add drugs, Benzos, ssrs,
all are connected to Canada.

143
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:31,100
So it makes sense that it
would filter over there. Yes.

144
00:08:31,101 --> 00:08:34,970
But what I would say is the people who
think that cannabis is not part of that

145
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,590
overprescribing problem are
deluding themselves. And
what do you think did that,

146
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:43,140
so he, can you repeat the
question again? So, so, so I,

147
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:48,200
I agree with Joe the way that the
access to opioids in the US. I mean,

148
00:08:48,201 --> 00:08:50,660
certainly it's come down a little bit in
the last couple of years, but you know,

149
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:54,280
Purdue Pharma, there's a special place
in hell for those guys. But not just,

150
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,340
it's not just opiates,
prescribe too many benzos.

151
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:00,460
We prescribe too many add drugs.
We probably prescribed too many SSR.

152
00:09:00,461 --> 00:09:03,800
I's we prescribed too much in this
country. I think we all agree on that.

153
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:04,770
I agree with that.

154
00:09:04,771 --> 00:09:09,771
I think that cannabis is another example
of us looking for a drug to solve our

155
00:09:10,561 --> 00:09:14,850
problem. But what, what um, okay.
Again, just from a clinical perspective,

156
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,510
um, you know, I can't just rely on,

157
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:22,770
on Diet and exercise for all my patients.
I have to use other tools. And again,

158
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:25,890
like everyone here in this room,
like we're all pretty healthy.

159
00:09:25,891 --> 00:09:28,410
I don't have a bad back or you know,

160
00:09:28,411 --> 00:09:32,040
I don't have a mental health diagnosis
or anything going on. So, you know,

161
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:34,950
I have to look at patients
that are coming to me. Right.

162
00:09:34,951 --> 00:09:39,360
So the way I see it is that, you know,
we just mentioned a bunch of other drugs,

163
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:42,270
you know, anti depressants and fetid
means all these types of things. You know,

164
00:09:42,271 --> 00:09:45,840
cannabis, and again, you know, I'm going
to separate the chief. So you and the CBD,

165
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:51,210
it's an incredible medicine and
it doesn't kill people. Right?

166
00:09:51,211 --> 00:09:53,660
So as a clinician,
you know that,

167
00:09:53,661 --> 00:09:58,410
that's so comforting for me to know
that every single night I go to bed,

168
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:01,950
I killed zero people. I know
that. Right? So that's really,

169
00:10:01,951 --> 00:10:05,040
really comforting for me to
know. Also, I feel, you know,

170
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:08,760
we just talking about amphetamines, we
were just talking about, you know, ssrs,

171
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:10,290
I feel that cannabis,
you know,

172
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:14,100
particularly the CBD component can
actually be more effective. You know,

173
00:10:14,101 --> 00:10:17,190
that's what I've seen a lot in my practice
and other people have seen that as

174
00:10:17,191 --> 00:10:18,390
well. So, you know,

175
00:10:18,391 --> 00:10:22,110
I think that we need to need to take
that into consideration when we're using

176
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,200
all these drugs. And Alex, you know,
some of the things that you're saying,

177
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:27,660
you know, they're quite, you know, um,

178
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:31,750
admirable and in a lot of things
like researchers say, you know, are,

179
00:10:31,751 --> 00:10:35,300
are quite admirable as well.
And, you know, they, they
feel that they can, you know,

180
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:38,400
tell clinicians, um, you know,
give them really good advice,

181
00:10:38,401 --> 00:10:40,680
but they're not the ones in the trenches.

182
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:43,520
They're not the ones in front of the
people. They're not the ones that,

183
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,780
that have to have to chat with patients.
You know,

184
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:50,070
I have an obligation to do something
for my patients to make them better.

185
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:51,690
I really feel,
you know,

186
00:10:51,691 --> 00:10:55,680
we just listed a bunch of drugs
that cannabis is a really,

187
00:10:55,681 --> 00:11:00,060
really effective tool and, and it
doesn't kill anybody. So, you know,

188
00:11:00,061 --> 00:11:04,350
because of that, you know, I'm gonna,
I'm gonna keep using it. But like I said,

189
00:11:04,351 --> 00:11:06,030
I'm always looking for other drugs.

190
00:11:06,031 --> 00:11:10,860
I'm always looking for other alternatives
that to also, um, help my patients.

191
00:11:10,861 --> 00:11:12,690
But I think that,
you know,

192
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:18,110
using cannabis is a really effective
tool for a lot of clinicians and it's

193
00:11:18,781 --> 00:11:19,890
helped a lot of patients.

194
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,890
But what do you think about his argument
about it being a gateway drug other

195
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:24,750
than what these people said in the study?

196
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:27,150
That there's no evidence that supports it,
it's a gateway drug.

197
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:31,800
What are your personal feelings about
that argument? So I don't feel that, uh,

198
00:11:31,801 --> 00:11:35,570
that cannabis is a gateway drug. I do
feel that, you know, one of the, uh,

199
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,800
the things that you mentioned
earlier is that, you know,

200
00:11:37,801 --> 00:11:41,940
some people kind of had this personality
where they're like an experiment, right?

201
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:45,460
And they, they just, they just want to
want to try something. So, you know,

202
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:46,231
the fact is,

203
00:11:46,231 --> 00:11:50,340
is that alcohol and cannabis just get
introduced first most of the time,

204
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:55,030
most people, you know, don't do,
you know, coke or, or LSD and then,

205
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:59,440
hey, say, hey man, let us try some,
some cannabis. Right? So it's just that,

206
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:04,410
that's the very first one there. So
if we, so you could say anything that,

207
00:12:04,411 --> 00:12:07,880
that, that was easier access. If there
were some new drug that you know,

208
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:11,700
did something similar to
alcohol or similar to cannabis
and that was introduced

209
00:12:11,701 --> 00:12:16,390
in, in our society, you'd be
calling that the gateway drug.
Um, and I do feel, and I,

210
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,710
I do believe that nearly been demonstrated
as being the gateway drug to almost

211
00:12:20,711 --> 00:12:23,620
all heart drugs because of
the loosening of inhibitions.

212
00:12:23,621 --> 00:12:26,830
Whereas the opposite could be said about
cannabis that it makes you paranoid.

213
00:12:26,831 --> 00:12:30,440
You might actually be less likely
to try cocaine afterwards. And,

214
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,130
and I know that the name,
uh, you know, they don't,

215
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,430
they don't feel that the cannabis is
a gateway drug either. I mean again,

216
00:12:36,431 --> 00:12:37,330
they said,
you know,

217
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:41,620
they found no compelling evidence to
support the gateway theory. And again,

218
00:12:41,621 --> 00:12:44,710
I mean these are the people that
you are quoted in your book out.

219
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:49,700
Let me just go a little bit further.
They said in a retrospective cohort study,

220
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:50,500
um,

221
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:55,270
may it from e t a l and the 2016 exam
and the transition from cannabis use to

222
00:12:55,271 --> 00:12:56,710
the use of other elicit drugs.

223
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:01,240
They found that the probability
of initially other elicit
drugs after canvas did

224
00:13:01,241 --> 00:13:03,890
not differ significantly
from the probability of,

225
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:08,770
of starting with other elicit drugs.
So it's just that cannabis is there first.

226
00:13:08,771 --> 00:13:13,330
It's definitely not a gateway drug in
any stretch of the imagination. I just,

227
00:13:13,331 --> 00:13:15,580
I totally disagree. And there again, 50

228
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:19,780
years of data on this. I know the
studies that he's quoting, but there are,

229
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:24,100
there are many others. And I think
the argument is as to why. And again,

230
00:13:24,101 --> 00:13:29,101
I think the argument that that to some
extent having access to this drug via,

231
00:13:29,861 --> 00:13:33,610
you know, illegally tends to open
you up to other illegal stuff,

232
00:13:33,611 --> 00:13:36,950
which to me is an argument
for legalization. So, but I,

233
00:13:36,951 --> 00:13:39,490
I do want to throw one thing out there.
You know,

234
00:13:39,491 --> 00:13:43,060
I don't know how many of your viewers
have teenage kids or you know,

235
00:13:43,061 --> 00:13:43,541
it's probably,

236
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:46,330
they're probably more likely to be
teenage kids and to have teenage kids.

237
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:49,420
But you know,
the book has,

238
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:53,980
the one thing that
really worries me in the,

239
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:59,070
if we're talking about gateway drugs
is that jewel and vaping are really a

240
00:13:59,351 --> 00:14:03,820
gateway to THC. Vaping. So you can, you
know, you can refer to that because,

241
00:14:03,821 --> 00:14:08,590
well first of all it gets people, it
gets kids, teenagers used to inhaling,

242
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,070
you know,

243
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:14,020
this elicit substance and you can
actually retrofit a jewel pod with THC.

244
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,450
They don't sell them,
but you can, you know,

245
00:14:15,451 --> 00:14:17,860
you can easily go online
and look up how to do it.

246
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,010
And I think it really worries me,

247
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:25,510
and I've heard from a lot of parents in
the last month that there is an epidemic

248
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,261
of Nicotine,

249
00:14:26,261 --> 00:14:30,850
vaping and TAC vaping going on
right now and that I think, and,

250
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:35,140
and we're talking about 15 1617
year olds inhaling pure THC,

251
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:39,160
the most dangerous form of this drug.
And I think unfortunately,

252
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:43,000
it's not going to take long before the
mental health consequences of that become

253
00:14:43,001 --> 00:14:43,834
apparent.

254
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:47,800
And I really do hope that the book gives
parents some tools to talk to their

255
00:14:47,801 --> 00:14:49,960
kids about that.
If nothing else.
