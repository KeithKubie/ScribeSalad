00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.840
I have a certain fondness for saying everything
is chemicals,

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.420
mostly this is because I'm tired of all the
people complaining about all the "chemicals"

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:12.380
that they are exposed to when literally everything
you have ever been exposed to,

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.580
including the most organically grown lettuce
is composed entirely of chemicals.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.150
But when I say everything is chemicals, I
am in fact wrong.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.260
There are quite a lot of things that aren't
chemicals:

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.800
sound, heat, laser beams, the existential
concept of selfness...rainbows.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.820
All of those things are things.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.300
And all of the things and also all other things
are, in fact

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.560
-- oh god this is weird but it's true --
they're all the same thing: energy.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.480
Everything is energy.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:48.900
[Theme Music]

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.379
Let's talk about trebuchets.

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:52.149
The trebuchet was a weapon of war,

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:58.029
but it is also a feat of ancient engineering so I remember it for that instead of for all the people it killed.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.199
Well, I happen to have a very small one that
I built from a kit, because I'm a nerd.

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:05.420
This tiny trebuchet contains quite a lot of
energy.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.270
In fact, more than you might suspect.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.619
And because we are humans and we like to understand
stuff,

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.030
we shall put the energy it contains into a
bunch of different boxes.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.960
Let's start with the least obvious one: its mass, since, as Einstein told us, energy and mass are the same thing.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.719
Now we're not gonna go into detail there,

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.079
instead we'll just say that the energy is well and locked up and extremely difficult to access

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:28.450
because the nuclear energy of the wood is
not easy to release.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.450
Which is excellent, because the nuclear energy
of this trebuchet, if released,

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.609
could destroy the entire building that I'm
sitting in.

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:37.749
This little war machine also has thermal energy;

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:42.420
anything warmer than absolute zero has thermal
energy, even very very cold things.

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:47.009
This basically means that all of the individual
atoms and molecules are jiggling imperceptibly.

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.700
Only at absolute zero would they stop jiggling.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.620
If I were to touch it then my hand would instantly
freeze and then fall off of me.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.240
Absolute zero is very cold.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.710
It also has chemical energy, which is stored
in the bonds between the atoms.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.460
All of the bonds in the molecules of cellulose
and lignin that make up the wood contain energy,

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.850
and some of them could be broken, releasing
that energy,

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.830
which is what would happen if I lit my trebuchet
on fire,

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.390
which I will not do because it took like four
hours to put together.

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.970
Now none of those forms of energy are the forms of energy that the ancient generals were interested in,

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.110
of course, but I wanted to illustrate how
much energy really is in there.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.870
What the ancient generals were interested in was the system's gravitational potential energy,

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.260
because this heavy thing here which is full
of pennies

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:27.640
-- oh God, that's dangerous --

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.970
this thing is heavy, it's full of pennies,
and it has been lifted up, and the force of

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.159
gravity is trying to pull it back down.

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:36.170
This stored gravitational energy is a form
of potential energy;

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.840
that is, energy contained within a system
because of its position.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.819
This does not mean that it has the potential
to become energy.

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.019
It is energy.
It's just stored.

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.370
If it wasn't there, and then it was, then
you would be creating energy.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.120
And as we all know, you cannot create energy.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.030
Like, we all do know that, right?

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.750
It's the first law of thermodynamics, also
known as the law of conservation of energy,

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.090
which is a real, hard and fast, not just unbreakable
but unbendable law of physics.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.760
Energy cannot be created and it cannot be
destroyed.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.250
The amount of energy in the universe is constant.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.629
And since everything is energy, the amount of everything in the universe is constant, which is a little bit trippy.

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:21.110
Deep thoughts like that one are what formalized
the study of energy into what we call thermodynamics,

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.439
the branch of science studying heat, energy,
and the ability of that energy to do work.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.920
Okay, now I just said three words that you think you know the definition of but you probably don't.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.340
That's okay, you're gonna be wrong many times
in your life, this is just one of them.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.230
So, what were those words?

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.650
Energy. I know that you don't know what energy
is, because, like, I don't either.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.879
Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman
said:

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:46.659
"it is important to realize that in physics today we have no knowledge of what energy is."

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.959
But let's just give the same cop-out answer
that my textbook gives, which is:

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.579
"the capacity to do work or produce heat."

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.420
Work. In the common vernacular, that's anything
that you have to do but you don't want to.

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.980
But in physics and chemistry, work is when
a force acts on something, causing it to move.

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.180
If nothing moves, then no work is done.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.079
There are a few different symbols that represent
work, we're going to use the lowercase "w."

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:09.879
Heat. Which is maybe the most misunderstood
word in chemistry after the word chemicals.

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:12.349
Heat is not something that objects contain.

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:15.930
Just like something can't have work, something
can't have heat.

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.480
Instead, heat, just like work, is an energy
transfer.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.610
But instead of transferring energy by mechanical
movement,

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:25.280
heat is a transfer of energy by thermal interactions,
such as radiation or thermal conduction.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.540
Now crazy as this might seem, those are the
only two things that energy can do.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.130
It can either be work applying force and moving
things or it can be exchanged as heat.

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.450
Both process result in an energy transfer
between systems.

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:41.640
And just in case you weren't confused enough, the most common symbol for heat is lowercase "q."

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.460
Yup. Lowercase "q," deal with it.

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.340
Little-known fact: the word "heat" used to
start with a silent q,

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.170
but it was dropped in the seventeenth century
when -- I'm just making stuff up.

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:53.670
So we're just gonna have to move on, leave
that behind us,

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.780
and think about what happens when the amount
of energy in a system changes.

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:02.040
If you're currently freaking out, thinking, like, "but Hank, you just said that the amount of energy never changes!"

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.120
I will remind you that I said "in the universe."

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.080
See, when we're doing thermo, we get to divide
the universe into two parts,

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.930
which is actually a pretty cool thing to get
to do.

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.080
One part is the system, the thing that we're
studying, and everything else is the surroundings.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.580
The surroundings allow the amount of energy
in the system to change.

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.040
That change just has to come from or go to
the surroundings.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.970
And we get to decide where that line is.

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:26.630
We could say that the system is the rock that
the trebuchet propels, or the sling,

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:30.900
or the trebuchet itself, or the face of the
poor guy that the rock runs into.

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.880
Whether it's the Earth-trebuchet system, or the rock-face system, or the entire observable universe system,

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.790
we get to decide based on what we're interested
in studying.

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:44.720
Every system has an internal energy, the sum of all that system's kinetic and potential energy.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.600
The internal energy of the system is represented
by a capital "E",

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.150
and usually we're interested in changes in
that system.

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.820
And the way we represent change in chemistry
and physics is with the Greek letter delta(Δ),

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:58.520
so we stick the delta in front of the "E" for "ΔE", the change in the energy of the system.

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.960
The change in the energy of the system is
equal to the heat plus the work.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.300
The simplest equation you're ever gonna see
on Crash Course Chemistry.

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.880
There are two basic outcomes when you're looking
at this internal energy equation.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.930
The first is that ΔE is positive.
It's gaining energy from the surroundings.

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.950
That's the case if work is done on the system
or heat is transferred to the system.

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:20.840
Like if I were to do some work to get the
trebuchet ready to fire, ΔE is positive.

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:25.720
The system is gaining energy from its surroundings,
which includes my arms and muscles.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:29.670
If work is done by the system or heat is transferred
from the system to the surroundings,

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:34.020
those w and q get negative signs resulting
in a decrease in ΔE,

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.790
or a loss of energy from the system to the
surroundings.

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:43.650
Like when the trebuchet fires, the trebuchet's ΔE is negative from the transfer of energy to the ping pong ball.

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:47.740
So what in the name of Willard Gibbs does
any of this have to do with chemistry?

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:52.660
Well, the energy stored in molecular bonds,
chemical energy, is a kind of potential energy.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.960
It exists because of the position of the particles
in the molecule.

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.820
Just like with the trebuchet, in chemistry
we can put energy into molecules, and take

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:02.350
it out, and even use it to do work,

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:06.780
creating war machines millions of times more powerful than the biggest siege engine ever constructed,

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:09.630
but also creating tools to feed and clothe
the world.

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:14.010
Some reactions release energy, like if I lit my trebuchet on fire -- which again I will not do!

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:15.580
Why do I keep bringing that up!?

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:18.120
Burning is the rapid oxidation of chemical
compounds,

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:22.640
and as it results in a heat flow out of the
system we call that an exothermic reaction.

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:26.280
But other reactions suck energy out of the
environment and into the system.

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:30.140
These endothermic reactions occur when heat
flows into the system.

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:33.050
Like in your car engine, at the high temperatures
of combusting fuel,

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:37.460
Nitrogen and Oxygen will suck some of that energy into chemical bonds forming nitric oxide,

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:43.740
a poisonous gas that I once inhaled a dangerous amount of, but I'll save that story for our lab safety episode.

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:47.500
Chemistry, it turns out, is largely a study
of energy.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:54.180
The energy stored in bonds, transferred between atoms and molecules to find stable forms and released to the environment to do work.

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:55.880
It's just like the trebuchet:

00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:00.580
put energy in, store it, and then take it back out to do something interesting, fun or useful.

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:06.060
That's basically everything that ever happens summed up in one little siege engine. Not bad.

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:08.260
Thanks for watching this episode of Crash
Course Chemistry.

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:11.910
If you were paying attention, you learned
that everything is energy;

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:15.870
that there are lots of different forms of
energy including potential energy,

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:20.360
which is energy contained within a system because of the position or arrangement of its components.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:25.340
And you learned that chemical energy is a kind of potential energy, energy stored up in bonds between atoms.

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:28.640
Also you hopefully already knew that energy
can neither be created nor destroyed,

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:31.280
and that the amount of energy in the universe
is constant;

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:35.699
but when studying thermodynamics we divide
the universe into the system and its surroundings,

00:08:35.699 --> 00:08:40.009
and a system could give energy to or take
energy out of those surroundings.

00:08:40.009 --> 00:08:44.769
You learned that energy can be transferred in two ways: work, which is force applied over a distance,

00:08:44.769 --> 00:08:48.160
and heat, which is the transfer of energy
by thermal interaction.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:53.140
And finally, you learned that all of this is just as applicable to chemistry as it is to trebuchets.
