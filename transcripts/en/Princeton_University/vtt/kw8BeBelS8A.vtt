Jeremy Blair:
This trip began in 2008 when a Princeton professor
and a group of students came to Ashaiman to

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.230 position:69%
Jeremy Blair:
see what the conditions were like and what
the people in the community needed, and they

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:41.000 position:72%
Jeremy Blair:
made their way to the Evangelical Presbyterian
Church and school complex, and after some

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.390 position:66%
Jeremy Blair:
discussion, decided that a partnership to
build a community library would be helpful

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:52.210 position:83%
Jeremy Blair:
for both the school and the surrounding community.
So the goal of this trip was really just to transform

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.860 position:67%
Jeremy Blair:
the foundations of a structure into a fully
functioning community library.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:03.860 position:70%
Akhil Reddy:
So, my expectations for this trip were really
to just get a lot of hands-on experience with

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.890 position:97%
Akhil Reddy:
basic forms of construction that you usually don't see at Princeton.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.860 position:72%
Elizabeth O'Grady:
My favorite thing has been seeing the drawings
that we did back at school come to life and

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.150 position:63%
Elizabeth O'Grady:
really take form on a construction site.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:25.310 position:73%
Cole Freeman:
I really liked working on the construction
of the building. It's just hands-on engineering

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.610
Cole Freeman:
work, and that's a lot of fun.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.500 position:69%
Jeremy Blair :
It's been really, really interesting to see
how a construction project actually happens.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.990 position:70%
Jeremy Blair :
It's really different than anything you would
learn in a class, and it's really different

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.979 position:70%
Jeremy Blair :
than something you'd see on TV -- to actually
be on a construction site and see a building

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:50.630 position:73%
Jeremy Blair :
go from bare foundation to a complete structure
that you can see behind me right now. It's

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.619 position:67%
Jeremy Blair :
definitely a unique experience to be able
to come into a place, really experience it,

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.630 position:70%
Jeremy Blair :
get to know people in the community and leave
a mark on that community.

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:08.630 position:73%
Akhil Reddy:
I think our project will provide a large amount
of people with access to reading materials,

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.530 position:81%
Akhil Reddy:
education, story books that they didn't have before.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.360 position:89%
Jeremy Blair :
The building's completed. That's really exciting,
yeah. And so I'm really happy that the project has turned

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.829
Jeremy Blair :
out so well.

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:26.019 position:69%
Buse Aktas:
I think we were a great group. I had a great
time, and everybody should have a similar

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:28.280
Buse Aktas:
experience, I think.

00:02:29.029 --> 00:03:13.000
