00:00:12.689 --> 00:00:13.369
 
0:00:13.369,0:00:15.650
I come from a village called Pilikwi. 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:16.190
It's near Serowe.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:21.739
yes several and

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:23.449
I was ill.

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:27.579
I have a headache.

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:29.519
And after that headache 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.600
in 2 or 3 days 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.900
the herpes come out from this side. 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.660
When I went to the private doctor  

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:49.380
he told me it was the sign of HIV.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:55.190
 I was confused because that time, 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.960
it was the time when this HIV  
   
0:00:57.960,0:00:59.540
was not

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.390
normal like these days.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.440
So my doctor talked to me.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.500
 After he tested and saw that the test came out positive he

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.330
sat with me and talked to me first,

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.390
after that he told me I am HIV positive. 
 
0:01:17.340,0:01:19.990

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.120
When I was still talking to them,

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:28.120
 someone told me about AIDS Research Trials  

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.380
at Harvard.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.510
The staff at Tsepho,

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:35.690
they are very friendly, very polite. 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:41.440
They talk to people very nicely.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.170
So I met Dr. Westler 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.960
for the first time.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.890
 So he talked to me 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.480
and then he helped me very nicely.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:02:00.480
 And he's the one who gave me the medication for the first time. 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.430
These days, because more people have been affected.  
0:02:07.430,0:02:09.069
Now, these days,

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.209
the medication is there,

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:17.339
People are taking the medication.

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:20.669
So each and everyone has hope that maybe I will live,yeah,

00:02:20.669 --> 00:02:20.919
longer.
