00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:01.756
- [Instructor] At a barbecue to celebrate

00:00:01.756 --> 00:00:03.867
the end of the soccer season,

00:00:03.867 --> 00:00:06.117
1,354 hot dogs were served.

00:00:08.409 --> 00:00:10.533
Round the number of hot dogs

00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:12.033
to the nearest 10.

00:00:13.093 --> 00:00:17.010
Alright, let me just
rewrite the number, 1,354.

00:00:18.701 --> 00:00:22.102
Now let's just remember our places.

00:00:22.102 --> 00:00:22.935
I could write it like that.

00:00:22.935 --> 00:00:23.775
This is the ones.

00:00:23.775 --> 00:00:25.191
This is the tens.

00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:27.007
This is the hundreds place,

00:00:27.007 --> 00:00:30.491
and this is the thousands place.

00:00:30.491 --> 00:00:33.138
Now they want to round
the number of hot dogs

00:00:33.138 --> 00:00:34.618
to the nearest 10.

00:00:34.618 --> 00:00:36.790
So round it to the nearest 10 here,

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.665
and so right now we have five tens,

00:00:38.665 --> 00:00:39.652
but in order to round,

00:00:39.652 --> 00:00:41.824
we have to look to the
next smallest place,

00:00:41.824 --> 00:00:43.432
so we'll look to the ones,

00:00:43.432 --> 00:00:45.470
and we have four ones here,

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.999
and so because this
number is less than five,

00:00:48.999 --> 00:00:50.809
so because this is less than five,

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:52.103
we round down.

00:00:52.103 --> 00:00:53.603
So less than five,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.510
so we're gonna round down.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.010
If you round down,

00:01:01.282 --> 00:01:03.981
you get to exactly five tens,

00:01:03.981 --> 00:01:05.398
or you say 1,350.

00:01:08.955 --> 00:01:11.256
We have rounded to the nearest 10,

00:01:11.256 --> 00:01:12.506
1,350 hot dogs.

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:17.246
Let's do another one.

00:01:17.246 --> 00:01:19.225
So here we're told the attendance

00:01:19.225 --> 00:01:20.670
at a local basketball game

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.087
was 8,643 people.

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:25.901
Round the attendance to the nearest 100,

00:01:25.901 --> 00:01:27.094
and like always, pause this video

00:01:27.094 --> 00:01:29.134
and see if you can figure that out.

00:01:29.134 --> 00:01:30.551
Let's see, 8,643.

00:01:33.807 --> 00:01:36.123
We wanna round to the nearest 100,

00:01:36.123 --> 00:01:38.062
so we go one place to the right of that,

00:01:38.062 --> 00:01:39.624
and we say, okay, is this greater than

00:01:39.624 --> 00:01:40.865
or less than?

00:01:40.865 --> 00:01:42.950
Is this less than five or greater than

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.633
or equal to five?

00:01:44.633 --> 00:01:47.034
Since it is less than five,

00:01:47.034 --> 00:01:49.201
so this is less than five,

00:01:51.686 --> 00:01:52.644
so because of that,

00:01:52.644 --> 00:01:53.811
we round down.

00:01:54.646 --> 00:01:56.150
And so we were going to round down

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.983
to 8,600,

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.756
so we have rounded to the nearest 100,

00:02:02.756 --> 00:02:03.839
8,600 people.

00:02:06.106 --> 00:02:07.606
Let's do one more.

00:02:10.062 --> 00:02:13.562
The city of Joyville has 87,388 residents.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.142
Round the number of people

00:02:16.142 --> 00:02:17.327
who live in Joyville

00:02:17.327 --> 00:02:19.077
to the nearest 1,000.

00:02:20.014 --> 00:02:21.514
So we have 87,388.

00:02:24.891 --> 00:02:27.706
We wanna round to the nearest 1,000,

00:02:27.706 --> 00:02:30.159
so once again, we go
one place to the right.

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:32.057
We see that it is less than five,

00:02:32.057 --> 00:02:33.774
and so we're gonna round down.

00:02:33.774 --> 00:02:35.471
We are gonna round down

00:02:35.471 --> 00:02:36.304
to 87,000.

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:39.636
That is the nearest 1,000,

00:02:39.636 --> 00:02:40.469
87,000.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.074
Now since all of the examples,

00:02:43.074 --> 00:02:44.322
we ended up rounding down,

00:02:44.322 --> 00:02:45.155
let me just show you

00:02:45.155 --> 00:02:46.986
what would have happened when we round up.

00:02:46.986 --> 00:02:48.403
If it was 87,588,

00:02:53.298 --> 00:02:55.858
well, once again, we are
rounding to the nearest 1,000.

00:02:55.858 --> 00:02:57.052
You go one place to the right,

00:02:57.052 --> 00:02:58.749
and you say, "Hey, this
is five or larger."

00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:01.045
So in this case, you would round up,

00:03:01.045 --> 00:03:04.795
so you would round the
thousands up to 88,000

00:03:05.882 --> 00:03:07.683
in this situation.

00:03:07.683 --> 00:03:09.341
So you go one space to the right,

00:03:09.341 --> 00:03:11.357
one place value to the right.

00:03:11.357 --> 00:03:14.045
If that is less than five,

00:03:14.045 --> 00:03:15.982
then you round down.

00:03:15.982 --> 00:03:17.981
If it is five or greater,

00:03:17.981 --> 00:03:19.148
you round up.
