00:00:00.838 --> 00:00:03.212
- [Voiceover] Each square
on the a grid is unit square

00:00:03.212 --> 00:00:05.875
with an area of one square centimeter.

00:00:05.875 --> 00:00:10.042
So each of these squares
is one square centimeter.

00:00:11.014 --> 00:00:13.093
This is one square centimeter,

00:00:13.093 --> 00:00:16.494
and this is one square
centimeter, and so on.

00:00:16.494 --> 00:00:21.086
And now we're asked, what
is the area of the figure?

00:00:21.086 --> 00:00:23.218
By figure I'm sue they mean this bluish,

00:00:23.218 --> 00:00:27.666
purplish quadrilateral,
and we wanna know its area.

00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:31.833
And area is talking about how
much space the shape covers.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.983
How much space does this
quadrilateral cover?

00:00:36.983 --> 00:00:41.150
How many square centimeters
does the quadrilateral cover?

00:00:42.572 --> 00:00:44.885
To figure it out, we
could start by counting.

00:00:44.885 --> 00:00:45.921
Here's one.

00:00:45.921 --> 00:00:49.418
Here's one square centimeter
the quadrilateral covers,

00:00:49.418 --> 00:00:51.409
and I can keep counting like that,

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:53.919
all of the square
centimeters that I can see.

00:00:53.919 --> 00:00:55.419
Here's two, three.

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:59.047
Another row's got some here.

00:00:59.047 --> 00:01:00.380
Four, five, six.

00:01:02.638 --> 00:01:04.638
Down here, here's seven.

00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:08.166
Eight, nine.

00:01:09.863 --> 00:01:13.196
So there's nine full square centimeters.

00:01:14.705 --> 00:01:17.007
Nine square centimeters,

00:01:17.007 --> 00:01:18.638
but that's not the entire area.

00:01:18.638 --> 00:01:20.889
That's not everything it covers.

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:22.948
It also covers these small parts,

00:01:22.948 --> 00:01:26.615
these triangle-shaped
little spaces of area,

00:01:28.392 --> 00:01:31.185
and so we need to count those too.

00:01:31.185 --> 00:01:32.224
Let's look over here.

00:01:32.224 --> 00:01:35.932
Let's look, if we drew
one of these triangles

00:01:35.932 --> 00:01:39.932
into a unit square, and
then we drew another one

00:01:41.151 --> 00:01:43.870
on the other half of this unit square,

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.590
we would see that combined
they make one full unit square.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:49.573
So we can do that.

00:01:49.573 --> 00:01:51.527
We can take this triangle up here,

00:01:51.527 --> 00:01:55.048
which is half of a unit
square and combine it

00:01:55.048 --> 00:01:58.273
with this half of a unit square.

00:01:58.273 --> 00:02:00.657
So if we combine these two together,

00:02:00.657 --> 00:02:02.654
that's one more unit square.

00:02:02.654 --> 00:02:06.737
Now we have nine full unit
squares plus one more.

00:02:07.608 --> 00:02:11.969
But there's still more of
them, so we can keep combining.

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:15.058
This half unit square
combined with the other one

00:02:15.058 --> 00:02:18.475
on the bottom makes a second unit square,

00:02:20.943 --> 00:02:25.110
and finally, there's two
more halves here, one, two,

00:02:27.746 --> 00:02:29.536
which combine to make another whole.

00:02:29.536 --> 00:02:32.786
So we have nine full unit squares plus,

00:02:35.623 --> 00:02:40.338
plus three more unit squares
that we made by combining.

00:02:40.338 --> 00:02:43.408
We made one by combining these
two, a second unit square

00:02:43.408 --> 00:02:46.502
with these two, and a
third unit square here.

00:02:46.502 --> 00:02:48.824
So we have nine full unit squares

00:02:48.824 --> 00:02:52.396
and then three more unit
squares we put together,

00:02:52.396 --> 00:02:56.479
which is a total of 12
square units or 12 square,

00:03:00.691 --> 00:03:04.858
in this case our unit is
centimeters, 12 square centimeters.

00:03:06.353 --> 00:03:10.520
Our figure, our quadrilateral
covers 12 square centimeters,

00:03:11.508 --> 00:03:15.091
so it has an area of
12 square centimeters.
