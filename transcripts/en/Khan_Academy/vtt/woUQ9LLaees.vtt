00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:04.019
20 teachers were asked
about their favorite course.

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:05.600
7 teachers said language.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.950
3 teachers said history.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:08.400
9 teachers said geometry.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.160
1 teacher said chemistry.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.600
0 teachers said physics.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.680
Create a bar chart showing
everyone's favorite courses.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.062
So we've got the bar
chart right over here.

00:00:18.062 --> 00:00:19.520
And let's see what
we need to plot.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.240
So it said, 0
teachers said physics,

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.940
which is surprising
to me since physics

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.720
is arguably my favorite course.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.570
But let's plot
what the data has.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.864
So physics-- so right now
it looks like it's halfway

00:00:29.864 --> 00:00:31.405
between 0 and 1, so
you actually have

00:00:31.405 --> 00:00:33.730
to bring the physics down to 0.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.990
Let's see, chemistry.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:37.600
Let's see, 1 teacher
said chemistry,

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.350
so we got to bring
chemistry up to 1.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.010
Now, 9 teachers said geometry.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.350
So geometry, let's
bring that up to nine.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.510
1 teacher said chemistry.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.510
Oh, I already read that.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:50.360
History.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.870
History.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.310
3 teachers said history, so
let's bring history up to 3.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:56.070
And then language.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.810
7 teachers said language,
so let's move this up to 7.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.099
And I think if I didn't
make any careless mistakes,

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:04.980
we should be done.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:05.480
Yep.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.050
Very good.
