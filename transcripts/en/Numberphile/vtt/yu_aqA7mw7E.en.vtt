00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:00.760
LAURENCE EAVES: Right.

00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:05.680
Well, I was born on May, which
is the fifth month, and on the

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.370
13th day of May.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.140
Mathematically, that's vaguely
interesting because these are

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:13.920
both Pythagorean primes.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.680
Right, OK.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:23.850
Well, if we look at 5, then
we can write 5 as

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.655
the sum of two squares.

00:00:26.655 --> 00:00:32.470
So 1 squared plus 2 squared
is equal to 5.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:33.820
Now if we take 13--

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.670
see if we can work
that one out.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:43.120
Well, 13 is 9 plus 4, so
4 is just 2 squared.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.000
And 3 squared is 9.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.260
So that gives me--

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.185
now, the next one, 17.

00:00:52.185 --> 00:00:57.100
We can do that as well, because
17 is 4 squared plus 1

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.780
squared, which is another
Pythagorean prime.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.660
Pythagorean--

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.360
we've all heard of Pythagoras,
who was a very famous

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.110
mathematician.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.850
So why do these numbers
bear his name?

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.450
Well, if we remember our
right-angle triangle.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.780
So we've got a right triangle
there, and there's the

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:17.080
hypotenuse.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:23.190
And Pythagoras tells us that if
this thing is of length A,

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.860
and this bit here is of length
B, then A squared plus B

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.820
squared equals C squared.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.440
That's Pythagoras's Theorem.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.890
Now, of course, A and B don't
have to be integers.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.550
And C doesn't have
to be an integer.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:41.390
They could be any number.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:42.930
This could be 3.2 inches.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.340
This could be 5.75 inches--

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.760
whatever C is then.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.050
But we can play this
game with integers.

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.130
And when we do, we generate
these Pythagorean primes.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.300
If we look at 13, then it turns
out all of these numbers

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.920
can be written as 4n plus 1.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:06.830
So 13 is equal to 4n plus 1,
where n is equal to 3.

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:17.140
If we take 17, then 17 is 4n
plus 1 where n is equal to 4.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.430
So the Pythagorean
primes have this.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.990
We generate them this way,
but they've also got this

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.830
interesting property.

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.815
BRADY HARAN: Can I put any n in
there to get a Pythagorean

00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:30.950
prime, or only certain
n's will do it?

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:31.330
LAURENCE EAVES: No, no.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.840
For example, if we just take the
next one in this series,

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.790
if we put n equals 5, then
n equals 5 gives

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.900
me, of course, 21.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.925
OK, so that's just 20 plus 1.

00:02:45.925 --> 00:02:49.240
And although 21 is an odd
number, it's not a prime

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.920
number because it's equal
to 7 times 3.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.910
So 21 is not a prime.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.690
It's not even a prime,
so it's obviously not

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:59.680
a Pythagorean prime.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.350
So it's not all values of n
that give me these, just

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:03.730
special values.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.690
BRADY HARAN: We mentioned at the
start that your birthday

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.410
is the 13th of the
5th, and they're

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:09.352
both Pythagorean primes.

00:03:09.352 --> 00:03:09.910
LAURENCE EAVES: Yes.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.130
BRADY HARAN: Can you remember at
what point in your life you

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.860
realized your birthday was
two Pythagorean primes?

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.300
LAURENCE EAVES: When you asked
me to talk about numbers.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.910
I have a really favorite
Pythagorean prime, which I'd

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:23.820
like to tell you about.

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.090
And then I just realized
that 13 and 5 are

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.380
two nice, small ones.

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.770
BRADY HARAN: OK, tell me about
your favorite one.

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:31.760
LAURENCE EAVES: Well,
my favorite one,

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.470
of course, is 137.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:35.890
BRADY HARAN: For anyone that
doesn't know, by the way,

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.310
Professor Eaves is obsessed
with the number 137.

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.800
And you will see him talking
about it in multiple videos.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.550
LAURENCE EAVES: Not really
that obsessed.

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.760
But anyway, the inverse
fine-structure constant, which

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.300
we use a lot in atomic physics
and any problems to do with

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.610
the electrons and their
quantum behavior.

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.370
The fine-structure constant
alpha-- its

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.550
inverse is almost 137.

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.790
Not exactly 137.

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.400
And lo and behold, 137 is a nice
Pythagorean prime, which

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.330
I think is quite nice.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.470
And if we work that one out, of
course, we see-- how can we

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.930
make it up?

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.430
Well, with a little bit of
thinking, we can see that 11

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.140
squared gives me 121.

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.350
Then if I take 4 squared,
which is 16,

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.320
that adds up to 137.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.180
So can we draw the Pythagorean
triangle for that?

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.450
It will look something
like this.

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.400
I've changed the scale of my
units here a little bit.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:42.110
So we've got 11 there, 4 there,
and then this diagonal

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.910
is the square root of 137.

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.240
A nice Pythagorean prime.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.140
BRADY HARAN: So just to be
absolutely clear, the

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:56.190
hypotenuse of a right-angle
triangle, when the other two

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.930
sides are integers, won't
be a Pythagorean prime?

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.335
LAURENCE EAVES: Its square root
is a Pythagorean prime.

00:05:02.335 --> 00:05:03.080
BRADY HARAN: Its square root.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.330
LAURENCE EAVES: Yeah.

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.040
MATT PARKER:That's 28.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.250
How many arrows do you want?

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.650
So the next one, let's say we
did 3 to the power of, to the

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.760
power of, oh, arrow,
arrow, arrow.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.070
Whatever you want
to call this.

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:20.910
JAMES GRIME: And that will give
you the third perfect

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.160
number for--
