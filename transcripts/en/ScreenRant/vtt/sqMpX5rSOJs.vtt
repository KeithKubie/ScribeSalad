00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.930
Some people might think that actors have it
easy, without realizing that every time you

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.430
see them playing dead, taking a dive, fending
off live birds or their co-stars, it means

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.690
they actually had to do it over and over,
for days on end.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.990
That kind of stress can lead to tears, fights,
and sometimes, the actor threatening to abandon

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.430
the movie completely.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:32.930
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 Movie Scenes That
Almost Made Actors Quit.&nbsp;

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.690
12 Rounds
John Cena may look like someone who’s not

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.890
afraid of anything, just don’t expect him
to take you rock climbing.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.890
The pro wrestler turned action star admits
that he has a fear of heights, and while making

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.940
2009’s 12 Rounds he had to shoot a scene
where he repels down the side of a building

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.500
and then dangles from the rope in mid-air.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:58.490
On a DVD extra, Cena said the stunt made him
so uneasy that he almost quit movie entirely.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.570
Star Wars: The Force Awakens
On her first day of shooting The Force Awakens,

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.270
actress Daisy Ridley almost had a panic attack
in the middle of the desert when director

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.979
JJ Abrams gave her a note she would never
forget.

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:12.900
Describing her performance as the billion-dollar
franchise's new heroine as “wooden,” the

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.551
young actress, who was already terrified of
having Star Wars on her shoulders, almost

00:01:16.551 --> 00:01:18.570
walked away from Rey right then and there.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.140
Luckily for everyone, she decided against
it.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.250
The Abyss
For the scene in which Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.110
character is given CPR, the actress had no
choice but to be pushed, pressed, screamed

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.090
at and even slapped by her co-star Ed Harris,
all while lying on a cold, wet metal floor.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.640
So you can't blame her for walking off the
set when she found out a camera had broken

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.510
in the middle of the take, meaning they needed
to re-shoot it.

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.240
She eventually returned, giving Cameron enough
footage to stretch the scene out to a full

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.240
five minutes.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.250
One of the longest scenes of its kind, and
just another extreme case of the blockbuster

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:58.990
director driving his cast to the breaking
point.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.310
&nbsp;
Rocky IV

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.409
Things got a little too real on the set of
Rocky IV when Dolph Lundgren threw Carl Weathers

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.420
across the ring.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.110
Weathers stormed off and refused to return
to set.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.640
Production on the film halted for four days
until Sylvester Stallone was able to convince

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.829
Weathers into returning so could Drago finish
putting the future events of Creed in motion.&nbsp;

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:22.650
The French Connection
Director William Friedkin made it well known

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.409
that Gene Hackman wasn't his first choice
for the hard-nosed star in critical hit The

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:27.430
French Connection.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.249
Hackman was having second thoughts himself
when he had to wear a Santa costume and tackle

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:33.430
someone - 27 times.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.120
Hackman threatened to leave the film, and
even admitted he almost quit a handful of

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.569
times... while accepting his Oscar for Best
Actor.&nbsp;

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.510
The Birds
Alfred Hitchcock isn't remembered for treating

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:45.599
his actors well.

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:50.349
And according to actress Tippi Hedren, filming
the final attack scene was the worst week

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:51.349
of her life.

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:55.540
The original plan was to use mechanical birds,
but instead had real birds flung at her by

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.310
prop men, while others were actually attached
with string.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.390
On the fifth day of shooting, she collapsed
in tears and a doctor ordered Hitchcock to

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.329
give her a week’s rest.

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:08.329
&nbsp;
The Shining

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:12.239
As Wendy in The Shining, Shelley Duvall had
what Jack Nicholson has referred to as the

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.559
toughest job he’s ever seen an actor have.

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:18.260
She spent most of the film suffering from
exhaustion and dehydrated from the amount

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.739
of crying she had to do.

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.400
She even began to lose her hair.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.170
The scene where she tries to protect herself
from Jack with a baseball bat still holds

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.579
a spot in the Guinness World Records for the
most takes.

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:35.040
They had to shoot it 127 times.&nbsp;

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:43.760
Wayne’s World
Now that the Bohemian Rhapsody scene in Wayne’s

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.650
World has become one of the most well known
sing along moments outside of musicals, it’s

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.980
impossible to imagine Wayne and Garth banging
their heads to any other song.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.459
Mike Myers felt so strongly about using Queen’s
rock anthem that when the studio pushed for

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.879
a cheaper song by Guns and Roses, Myers was
ready to walk.

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:05.019
Since you can’t have Wayne’s World without
Wayne, the song stayed and Bohemian Rhapsody

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:09.999
became a number one hit 17 years after its
initial release.

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:13.169
Chinatown
Faye Dunaway famously clashed with director

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:15.040
Roman Polanski on the set of Chinatown.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.480
When the director refused to give the actress
a bathroom break while shooting the scene

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.770
where Jack Nicholson surprises her in her
car,she questioned her involvement altogether.

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:33.039
In the end, it got so bad that Dunaway had
to relieve herself into a coffee cup, which

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:36.990
she then threw in Polanski’s face.&nbsp;

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.729
The Fast and The Furious
The initial script for the first Fast and

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:45.780
Furious included a love triangle between Dom,
Letty, and Brian.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.340
Despite having already signed on to play the
character, Michelle Rodriguez fought tooth

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.759
and nail to have to this plot element removed,since
it made no sense to cheat on the alpha male

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:55.020
Dom with pretty boy Brian.

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.210
She was willing to quit and suffer the consequences
when the filmmakers decided to pump the brakes

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:05.650
on the love triangle, choosing Dom's little
sister, Mia, instead.&nbsp;

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.789
It's hard to picture what some of these movies
would have been had the stars walked away,

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:12.180
but what are your favorite stories of actors
pushed to the breaking point?
