00:00:00.454 --> 00:00:01.870
Now, let's think
about expressions

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:03.350
with more than one variable.

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:08.670
So say I had the
expression a plus--

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.620
I'll do a really
simple one, a plus b.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:17.340
And I want to evaluate this
expression when a is equal to 7

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.110
and b is equal to 2.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.840
And I encourage you to pause
this and try this on your own.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.800
Well, wherever we see
the a, we would just

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.460
replace it with the 7.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.230
And wherever we see the b,
we'd replace it with the 2.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.980
So when a equals
7 and b equals 2,

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.390
this expression
will be 7 plus 2,

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.010
which, of course, is equal to 9.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.320
So this expression
would be equal to 9

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.190
in this circumstance.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.930
Let's do a slightly
more complicated one.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:57.920
Let's say we have the expression
x times y minus y plus x.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.810
Actually, let's make it plus 3x.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.840
Or another way of saying
it plus 3 times x.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:14.936
So let's evaluate this when x is
equal to 3 and y is equal to 2.

00:01:14.936 --> 00:01:17.060
And once again, I encourage
you to pause this video

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.270
and try this on your own.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.630
Well, everywhere we see an
x, let's replace it with a 3.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.360
Every place we see a y,
let's replace it with a 2.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.810
So this is going to
be equal to 3 times y.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.180
And y is 2 in this case.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:40.710
3 times 2 minus 2
plus this 3 times x.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.320
But x is also now equal to 3.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.330
So what is this
going to be equal to?

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.620
Well, this is going to be
equal to 3 times 2 is 6.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.110
This 3 times 3 is 9.

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.860
So it simplifies
to 6 minus 2, which

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.890
is 4, plus 9, which
is equal to 13.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.725
So in this case,
it is equal to 13.
