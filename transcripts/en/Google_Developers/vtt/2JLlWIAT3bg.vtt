00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.000
NICK BUTCHER: Yes.

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.530
MALE SPEAKER: Wonderful.

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:04.790
NICK BUTCHER: Let's do it.

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.666
MALE SPEAKER: I think
we're rolling, awesome.

00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:09.650
So hi, welcome back to Devoxx.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.530
This is Devoxx 2013,
and I'm here with Nick

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:13.704
to talk about Android--

00:00:13.704 --> 00:00:14.370
NICK BUTCHER: Hi

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.078
MALE SPEAKER: -from
a design perspective.

00:00:16.078 --> 00:00:17.530
Is that the right word, design?

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.275
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah,
absolutely, like what

00:00:19.275 --> 00:00:22.000
it is to be an Android app,
how you design an Android

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.800
app to kind of look,
as well as work

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.540
like you expect an
Android app to be.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.220
MALE SPEAKER: So UX
is the word part,

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.670
and then the rest
is taste and color.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.970
Are you saying there's one
way to build apps only?

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.570
NICK BUTCHER: No.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.647
I'd say there's many ways
you can build an app.

00:00:38.647 --> 00:00:40.230
But I'd say there's
certain things you

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.150
can do to make your app work
like an Android app is expected

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.520
to work so that your users
will know how to use it

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.870
and they'll know how to navigate
around the content within it.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.630
The look and feel, the
aesthetic qualities

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.150
like colors, certain
interaction patterns-- those

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.980
can be customized to
bring your own personality

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:57.930
to your application.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.400
So if you look at a variety
of applications out there,

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.380
look at something
like the Expedia app

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.230
to the Google Play
Music application--

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:04.800
MALE SPEAKER: They're
quite different.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.360
NICK BUTCHER: --to the
alarm clock application.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.830
They look very, very different.

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.210
They all have their
own feel to them,

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.530
but they follow certain rules,
as in interaction patterns

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.090
and touch target and
presentation themes,

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.070
which means that when
a user picks it up,

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.395
they'll know how to use it.

00:01:21.395 --> 00:01:23.478
MALE SPEAKER: Right, so
that's absolutely the key.

00:01:23.478 --> 00:01:26.540
So, I'm an Android developer.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.040
Should I also be the designer?

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.345
Does that even make sense?

00:01:30.345 --> 00:01:32.720
NICK BUTCHER: If you want to
do both, if you can do both,

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:33.380
then awesome.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.940
More power to you.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.110
I enjoy doing both.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.420
It depends really.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.120
If you are working
on a big project

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.000
and you can have a
dedicated design resource,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.940
that's awesome.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.150
And I think a lot of the
most polished applications

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.080
are like that.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.190
If you're a one man band
who is just a developer

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.160
interested in design,
then hopefully there's

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.910
a lot of resources
we're putting out there

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.799
that you can get up to speed, so
things like the Android Design

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.090
guidelines, which have been
around for about a year now

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.965
and have progressively
gotten more and more--

00:01:58.965 --> 00:02:00.964
MALE SPEAKER: So you're
actually upgrading those

00:02:00.964 --> 00:02:02.520
with the releases of Android.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.710
NICK BUTCHER: Right,
right, with each release

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.900
and as each new pattern,
so every now and then,

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.691
such as when the Navigation
Drawer gained popularity,

00:02:08.691 --> 00:02:10.190
we started documenting
it and saying

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.510
we think this is the best
way you can use this pattern,

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.000
added that to the design site.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.030
As well as the show that
I do once a month or so,

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.550
called "Android
Design in Action,"

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.267
which is all about how
to design for Android.

00:02:21.267 --> 00:02:23.100
So hopefully we're
putting the resources out

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.650
there that if you're a developer
who's interested in design

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.051
that you can get up to speed.

00:02:27.051 --> 00:02:28.800
MALE SPEAKER: So, how
hard is it to start?

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.310
I mean there's the
Android Design guidelines.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.850
Do you need to read all of
it and implement all of it,

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.310
or you have it all
wrong, or is there a way,

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.680
like you don't have too
high of a bar to start with?

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.471
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:02:38.471 --> 00:02:40.890
My favorite thing about the
Android Design guidelines

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.780
is how short they are.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.270
It's not a massive tome of human
interface guidelines written

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.330
in very dry language that
is hard to get through.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.440
You can actually read the entire
site in about half an hour,

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.330
45 minutes.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.080
It's not a huge
amount of content,

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.630
so I would recommend,
yeah, read it.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.870
This is the basis of what
it is to be an Android

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.140
application, how
you should operate.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.640
So I'd say it's a great
start to read that and then

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.030
go from there.

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.800
There's a flourishing community
of people out there talking

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.360
about Android Design,
particularly on Google+,

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.850
which is where I see most
of the chatter happening,

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.330
as well as other places, like
Dribbble and other places.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.580
I think Android Design
conversation is really

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:20.160
picking up.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.090
MALE SPEAKER: So
what kind of reward

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.370
can a developer expect
from actually having

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.380
followed those guidelines, spent
the time actually designing

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.637
this, maybe on the
Play Store with users

00:03:28.637 --> 00:03:29.720
and interacting with them.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.261
Does that actually
make a difference?

00:03:31.261 --> 00:03:35.310
Can you actually
see changes in apps

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.000
that have gone from
default design to something

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.459
where there's more--

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.000
NICK BUTCHER:
Absolutely, thoroughly,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
like one case study
that comes to mind

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.510
is Pocket, the read
it later application.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.370
They did an exercise where
users were misunderstanding

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.500
their archive feature.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.065
And they changed
the user interface

00:03:51.065 --> 00:03:53.517
to follow our up
paradigm, where you

00:03:53.517 --> 00:03:56.100
have the button in the top left
to take you up within the app.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.694
And they changed
archive to an action

00:03:57.694 --> 00:03:59.860
on the right, which is where
users are expecting it.

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.080
And they saw some crazy
increase like 700% more use

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.060
of the feature or more
understanding of the feature.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.770
So there is definitely a lot of
benefit to an individual app.

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.350
I think the overall goal of
following the Android Design is

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:12.770
hopefully a better application.

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.400
So the process of going through
and thinking about your design

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.079
and improving it and
standing on the shoulders

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.720
of all the hard work gone into
the Android Design patterns.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.950
It should make your
application better.

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.490
So we do see a lot of
comments and feedback

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.980
from users, like the apps
which are nicely designed

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.920
tend to have a higher rating.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.320
As well as on the
Google Play Store,

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.340
there's obviously things
like the Top Lists,

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.245
as well as things
like Editors' Choice,

00:04:36.245 --> 00:04:38.370
or even there's a collection
of applications called

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.870
the Beautiful Design application
list, or collection I guess.

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.557
So you can't get into those
kind of things without having--

00:04:45.557 --> 00:04:47.640
MALE SPEAKER: And they
should be good inspiration.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.430
If you look at those,
if they got there,

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.840
probably if you do
something similar you can--

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:54.430
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, if you're
looking for inspiration,

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.266
go to the Beautiful
Design collection.

00:04:56.266 --> 00:04:58.140
Just Google for Android
Google Play Beautiful

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:59.485
Design and you'll
get this collection.

00:04:59.485 --> 00:05:01.190
And these are some
of the applications

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.530
that Google Play recognizes
as some of the best in class.

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.030
MALE SPEAKER: So
we've just released

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:08.920
the Android 4.4, KitKat.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.415
Does that change anything
to the Design guidelines?

00:05:11.415 --> 00:05:13.165
NICK BUTCHER: KitKat
to me is a maturing

00:05:13.165 --> 00:05:14.784
of the Design guidelines.

00:05:14.784 --> 00:05:17.200
MALE SPEAKER: But that means
a small change, still, right?

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.835
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, exactly.

00:05:17.835 --> 00:05:20.009
I don't think we've
radically changed direction,

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:21.550
but we've refined
all over the place.

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:22.591
It's all about polishing.

00:05:22.591 --> 00:05:25.120
It's all about delivering
a better experience.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.900
So color, like we
touched on earlier on,

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.020
we've backed away from having
these kind of very, very

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.070
strong accent colors.

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:33.910
So by default the
user interface used

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:37.225
to use a lot of this blue
that was kind of like, jolt

00:05:37.225 --> 00:05:38.980
of contrast in your application.

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.470
And it didn't particularly
leave a lot of room

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:43.600
for your app to have
its own personality,

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.660
because if your color-- your
branding was red, for example,

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.910
you have all these blue
stock controls in there,

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:52.420
it could be quite
clashing, really.

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.220
So what we've tried to do
with the OS is back that away.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:58.042
So by default you'll get
more of a neutral experience.

00:05:58.042 --> 00:06:00.250
But the reason is to leave
room for apps to innovate,

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.208
so an app can then express
its own personality.

00:06:02.208 --> 00:06:04.316
It can then customize
on top of that.

00:06:04.316 --> 00:06:05.940
So things like that,
I think is showing

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.040
a maturing of the platform.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.200
So the platform is
kind of getting out

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.742
the way to let the
apps really shine.

00:06:09.742 --> 00:06:10.575
MALE SPEAKER: Great.

00:06:10.575 --> 00:06:12.810
And then would you recommend
people actually changing

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:15.900
anything at this point
for KitKat specifically?

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.320
Or is it just more
choice and more way

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.649
to express themselves if needed?

00:06:21.649 --> 00:06:22.440
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.100
There are some other
features as well,

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.190
which I'm quite excited about.

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.314
So one thing I'm really
excited about for designers

00:06:27.314 --> 00:06:28.610
is the new Immersive Modes.

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.830
So you now get access
to the entire screen.

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.420
So if you have these
on-screen buttons

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:35.895
you can now draw behind them
or hide them temporarily

00:06:35.895 --> 00:06:37.260
or persistently.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:42.047
So that unleashes a whole
new kind of interaction mode.

00:06:42.047 --> 00:06:43.880
So I think if you look
at Google Play Books,

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.307
for example, which does a
beautiful job of hiding all

00:06:46.307 --> 00:06:48.140
the system chrome and
getting out of the way

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.460
and really focusing on
the experience of reading,

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.210
and then coming back
and making it really,

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:54.280
really easy to navigate
again when you need to,

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.780
I think those are the kind
of opportunities that KitKat

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:58.440
provides for designers
and developers

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.860
to have a really rich interface,

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:01.980
MALE SPEAKER: OK, cool.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.780
So, before we close, I have
an app on the Play Store.

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:07.490
It's doing OK.

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:10.480
I have a 3.x something
rating, which is not bad,

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.460
but I want to improve that.

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:13.930
Design guidelines is where I go.

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:16.100
Is there this one trick?

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:20.430
Give me that one flip to
switch to get a better design.

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:22.520
NICK BUTCHER: OK, so,
I would say the one

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.832
thing you can really do is focus
on your information hierarchy.

00:07:25.832 --> 00:07:27.290
I think the one
thing that people--

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:29.520
I know kind of coming from
a development background--

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.145
I'm really excited
to dive into the app

00:07:31.145 --> 00:07:34.410
and create it and use the
latest buttons and libraries

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:35.630
and so on.

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:37.970
But I think the biggest benefit
you can get in designing

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:40.640
is to really think about
the information hierarchy

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.550
and use that to
create your navigation

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:45.000
so that it makes the app
easier to navigate around.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.110
I think the visual stuff
can add a lot on top,

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:51.180
but if the fundamental
information hierarchy

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:54.490
isn't there, then you need
to start from the beginning.

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:56.820
So I'd say yeah, look at
your information hierarchy,

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:59.140
then look on navigation
and interaction patterns

00:07:59.140 --> 00:07:59.700
and use that.

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:01.158
And then once you're
kind of there,

00:08:01.158 --> 00:08:02.437
then apply the visual stuff.

00:08:02.437 --> 00:08:05.020
And one top tip, one thing that
really bugs me of applications

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:05.770
is touch feedback.

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:07.603
Just make sure you do
that properly as well.

00:08:07.603 --> 00:08:10.190
It's the simplest thing, but if
an application doesn't respond

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:13.050
when I touch it, then it
feels slow, it feels laggy,

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:14.570
it feels buggy.

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:17.920
So that's my one top tip for
something you should be doing.

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.510
Second top tip--
two top tips-- is

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:22.380
use Google Play's beta
functionality as well.

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:24.390
If you are playing
with this stuff,

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:27.007
it's a great, great opportunity
to use the beta testing

00:08:27.007 --> 00:08:27.590
functionality.

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:28.970
MALE SPEAKER: Do you want
me to remind what that is?

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:30.428
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah,
exactly, so you

00:08:30.428 --> 00:08:33.809
can create a community or a
Google Groups mailing list

00:08:33.809 --> 00:08:35.669
and have people
opt in to say, hey,

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:37.169
I've got a high
aptitude for risk.

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:40.197
I'd like to play with the latest
shiniest features before people

00:08:40.197 --> 00:08:42.530
and give you more feedback
without the expectation of it

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:45.386
being a stable
production release.

00:08:45.386 --> 00:08:47.260
So if you're doing these
kind of refinements,

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.830
you can push them to a
smaller slightly less

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:53.385
risk averse kind of group
and get feedback from them

00:08:53.385 --> 00:08:56.010
quite quickly without having to
distribute to all your hundreds

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:57.740
and thousands and
millions of users.

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:00.399
MALE SPEAKER: Great,
awesome, thanks for the tips.

00:09:00.399 --> 00:09:01.190
NICK BUTCHER: Cool.

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:03.148
MALE SPEAKER: And the
Android Design guidelines

00:09:03.148 --> 00:09:03.874
on the Android--

00:09:03.874 --> 00:09:05.540
NICK BUTCHER: Thanks,
It was a pleasure.

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:07.415
Yeah, check out the
Android Design guidelines

00:09:07.415 --> 00:09:10.010
at developer.android.com/design,
and follow "Android Design

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:12.677
in Action"
androiddesigninaction.com.

00:09:12.677 --> 00:09:13.510
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:15.110
Do it.

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:15.890
Thank you.

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:17.090
NICK BUTCHER: Awesome.

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:17.990
Sweet.

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:19.540
We good?
