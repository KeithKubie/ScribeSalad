00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.020
- Welcome to a Conversation with History.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.950
I'm Harry Kreisler of the Institute

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.420
of International Studies.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.390
Our guest today is Peter Singer,

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.843
who is the Ira W. Decamp
Professor of Bioethics

00:01:06.843 --> 00:01:11.290
at Princeton University's
Center for Human Values.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.250
Professor Singer, welcome to Berkeley.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.740
- Thank you, it's a pleasure to be here.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.860
- Where were you born and raised?

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.730
- I was born and raised
in Melbourne, Australia.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.190
- And looking back, how
do you think your parents

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.083
shaped your thinking about the world?

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.880
- Oh, I think, you know,
my parents were immigrants

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.450
to Australia, they were
refugees from the Nazis,

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.700
so they had arrived in Australia in '38,

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.930
that's eight years before I was born.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.513
Certainly their immigrant experience,

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.190
the fate of their more extended family,

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.940
who were left in Europe and
many of whom became victims

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.313
of the Holocaust, that
certainly shaped my views.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.270
And so did Australian
society, which I think

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.030
is a reasonably open, friendly,

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.820
egalitarian, tolerant society, so I'm sure

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.513
that growing up in Australia
left a big impact on me.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.110
- What was conversation
around the dinner table like,

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.690
was anyone in your family
interested in philosophy,

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.600
or was it a discussion of current

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.660
events, or sports? (laughs)

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.680
- Well, no, there was
no particular interest

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.340
in philosophy as such,
but not in sports either.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.620
There was certainly some
about current events,

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.520
about what was happening in the world.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.100
There was perhaps a bit
more interest in psychology.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.930
My grandfather had been
a colleague of Freud's

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.920
in Vienna, had worked with him, and then

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.730
later would work with Alfred Adler,

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.820
and my mother was a medical practitioner,

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.200
but she was interested in psychology.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.270
So that kind of topic came up,

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:53.730
I was aware of that background,

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.490
but I couldn't say that we
had intensive discussions

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.310
about either Freudian or Adlerian

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.970
psychology around the dinner table.

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.430
It may have come up occasionally,

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.407
but it wasn't a regular
staple of conversation.

00:03:05.407 --> 00:03:10.407
- And you actually, later
in your academic career,

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.230
wrote a book about your grandfather.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.830
Tell us a little about--
- I did, yes.

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.450
I wrote, not that long ago, really,

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.210
maybe, what, 10 years ago
or something like that,

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.130
a book called Pushing Time Away:

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.330
My Grandfather and the
Tragedy of Jewish Vienna.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.250
As I said, I'd known about my grandfather

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.090
and his work with Freud all my life,

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.950
I knew that he'd written
a book and a number

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.130
of other articles that
were published in journals.

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.750
My mother and my aunt had those works.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.550
They also had some letters from him.

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.320
But I hadn't really read them;

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.250
they were in German, I do read German

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.680
but I read it more slowly
than I read English,

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.080
and I had, guess, not felt it was really

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.130
a priority for me to read them,

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.000
until as I started to get older I thought,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.540
well, if I don't do this soon

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.810
I'll never get to know what my grandfather

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.350
was like, what his ideas were like.

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.590
And so I started to read some of this,

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.360
and as I read, I thought, there is a lot

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.600
of interesting material here, a lot

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.040
of different kinds of
material, private letters

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.020
as well as the more academic articles;

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.580
the history of the
Freudians in the early days

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:28.800
and the breakup that led to

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.780
the split off from the Adlerians.

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.020
So I decided to write about that,

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.540
and then I also wrote about the tragedy

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.240
of what happened, why
my grandparents did not

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.240
come with my parents to
Australia, and their sad fate.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.833
- And the title is interesting, and where

00:04:47.833 --> 00:04:50.683
did that come from, Pushing Time Away?

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.260
- That title comes from a
letter that my grandfather

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.710
wrote to my grandmother
before they were married,

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.570
one of, (laughs) it seems silly today,

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.150
but my grandfather's parents objected

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.530
to his proposal of
marriage to my grandmother

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.770
because she was three
years older than him,

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.910
and in those days it was expected that men

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.610
would marry women younger
than them rather than older.

00:05:16.462 --> 00:05:20.780
So he wrote to her that "what
unites us pushes time away."

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.600
Basically I suppose he
was saying that we have

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.070
an intellectual companionship,
an intellectual union,

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.010
not merely one based
on physical attraction.

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:33.200
And I thought that that
struck me as a good phrase

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.470
for what I was trying to do in writing

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.066
about my grandfather,
and my grandmother too,

00:05:38.066 --> 00:05:40.280
I was trying to push time away

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.870
so that I could get to
know them despite the fact

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.480
that they, or certainly my grandfather,

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.390
had died before I was born.

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:51.573
- What did you learn from this experience,

00:05:53.168 --> 00:05:56.440
and how did that affect you personally?

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.420
That is, of writing the book?

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:02.400
- Well, I mean, I learned
some personal things

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.900
about the various sort of unfortunate

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.870
semi-accidental
circumstances that prevented

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.923
my grandparents from leaving Austria,

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.270
and that was very sad, it
was one of these things

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.300
where you kept thinking, if only,

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.150
if only this had happened
slightly differently,

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.470
if only they had had
a better understanding

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:25.293
of the urgency of leaving and so on,

00:06:25.293 --> 00:06:26.883
they could have been saved.

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:30.920
So there was certainly that.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.890
I also got a sense of the
intellectual background

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:38.111
out of which I came, and a better sense

00:06:38.111 --> 00:06:41.160
of what my grandparents were like

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.200
and what the city in
which they lived was like,

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.570
so I had a better understanding of Vienna

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:49.700
in that really, I think
great period of Vienna

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:54.700
from around the turn of the
century until the Nazi takeover.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.990
Obviously Vienna was a very lively

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:02.520
and exciting city to be
in, with quite a large

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:05.650
Jewish population, and
certainly some anti-Semitism

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:10.310
but still a fair amount of
tolerance and acceptance

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:13.150
with the Jewish population of Vienna

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.863
really playing a major
role in its cultural life.

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:18.840
- One of the themes in your work

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:22.860
is kind of the universal
application of values,

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:25.290
if I can state it that way.

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:28.210
Was that, going through
the history of the Jewish

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:33.210
community there, did
that sort of impact you

00:07:34.255 --> 00:07:39.255
and confirm your feelings about

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:47.890
what happens when a group like the Nazis

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:51.720
impose their will on populations

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:55.003
and identify certain
people as being outsiders?

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:58.740
- Certainly there's, I mean, I think

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:00.540
I didn't have to actually write the book,

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:03.790
I think I already had
that from my childhood,

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:07.090
the idea of the importance of preventing

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:10.980
authoritarian rule of this sort,

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:15.440
the importance of establishing basic

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.670
guarantees, if you like, that minorities

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:23.610
are not to be excluded in that
way, discriminated against.

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:25.560
Yes, I think that was
something I could already had;

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.070
you could say it was
confirmed by the book,

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:30.980
but I already had it solidly enough.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:34.110
So I don't think the universal
values come from that.

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:37.730
I mean, if anything,
what I got from the book

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:42.730
was my grandfather's
immersion in the values

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.190
of ancient Greece and Rome,

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:48.880
because he was a classics scholar.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:53.140
And so he was really interested in values

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:58.140
and he was interested in
how to live ethically,

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:00.360
he may not have used exactly that term,

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:03.530
but he was interested in
the ideas of the ancients.

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:06.350
And so that sense that these ideas

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:08.750
still speak to us and that we still have

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:10.890
things to learn and things to share

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:14.240
with all sorts of different
kinds of civilizations

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.810
and periods, that's something that I

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:20.113
perhaps did get from reading his writings.

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:24.270
- Back to your education now.

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:26.490
Where did you do your undergraduate work,

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:29.590
and then at what point in your education

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:34.590
did you decide that philosophy
was what you wanted to do?

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:35.687
- I did my undergraduate degree

00:09:35.687 --> 00:09:37.423
at the University of Melbourne,

00:09:38.414 --> 00:09:41.770
and I was originally planning to do law,

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:46.340
but I got interested in the humanities.

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:48.560
For a long time I didn't
decide between doing

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:52.370
history and philosophy,
and I think I ended up

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:54.880
doing philosophy because I felt

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:57.433
there were bigger issues that
I could look at and work at,

00:09:57.433 --> 00:09:59.790
this is at the time when I was thinking

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:02.930
of going on to do some graduate work

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:05.490
in one or the other, in
history or philosophy.

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:09.120
And I chose philosophy because I could

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:12.530
talk about really important issues, about

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:15.610
what's right and wrong and
why we should act ethically,

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:18.210
whereas the history
department wanted me to do

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:21.180
some original research based on documents

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:24.370
that had not been really studied

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:27.250
or written about that much, so essentially

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:28.650
they were pushing me to do something

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:33.280
on an area of less interest both to me

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:36.930
and, I think, of less significance
to the world as a whole.

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:41.930
- And then you went on to
Oxford and did a DPhil there.

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:45.150
- I actually did a degree
called a BPhil, yeah,

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:47.380
I guess I'm unusual among academics

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:50.840
in not having a doctorate,
because at the time,

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:53.110
certainly as far as
getting an academic job

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:55.130
in Australia was concerned, it was

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:56.780
not necessary to have a doctorate.

00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:59.360
The Oxford degree was a graduate degree,

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.810
it's a two-year graduate degree

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:03.660
involving a thesis as well as coursework,

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:05.950
and from the point of view of Australian

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:08.090
philosophy departments, that was an ideal

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:10.820
preparation for an academic career.

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:15.260
- And so in this, laying
the foundation of your

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:19.513
intellectual journey, what
led you to Utilitarianism?

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:24.660
- I was already led towards Utilitarianism

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:29.660
as an undergraduate by
one of my teachers there,

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:32.340
a professor called H.J. McCloskey,

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:35.300
who wrote about ethics and actually was

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:38.380
himself quite hostile to Utilitarianism.

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:41.570
But he did give it a fair presentation,

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:44.590
and even as an undergraduate, I felt

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:47.410
that the objections he brought against it

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:50.320
were not knockdown
objections, that there were

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:53.053
possible replies to those objections.

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:56.883
And I remember already
in undergraduate essays

00:11:56.883 --> 00:11:59.210
pushing those replies and saying, well,

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:01.700
this is not really a reason
for not being a Utilitarian,

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:03.970
and then, you know, some other argument

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:05.560
is not a good reason either.

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:10.240
And in the end I decided
that none of the objections

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.740
to Utilitarianism that
some other philosophers

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:17.350
had thought were sufficient
reason for rejecting it,

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:20.180
that none of them were
really strong enough

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:21.763
to persuade me to reject it.

00:12:23.136 --> 00:12:28.136
- Along the way here, you're
actually doing your education,

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:32.733
especially your work
at Oxford, in the '60s,

00:12:33.961 --> 00:12:37.387
so I'm curious as to how
all the events of the '60s

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:42.120
were shaping you, and
your actual involvement

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:47.120
in student organizations and
other movements at that time?

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:49.950
- Right, that was
actually at the University

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:51.260
of Melbourne more than Oxford.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:55.463
I only went to Oxford in
'69, towards the end of '69.

00:12:56.370 --> 00:13:00.480
And certainly the student movement

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:03.780
was already quite strong at
the University of Melbourne,

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:05.060
particularly because Australia

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:08.000
was involved in the Vietnam War.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.090
We were sending troops to
fight alongside the Americans

00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:15.120
and we reintroduced conscription;

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:16.460
there had been conscription previously,

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:18.641
then there'd been a period without it.

00:13:18.641 --> 00:13:21.263
It was reintroduced for the Vietnam War.

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:23.780
So there was a strong student movement

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:27.280
of opposition to the war,
and I was part of that,

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.760
I was actually president
of an organization

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:32.630
called Melbourne University
Campaign against Conscription.

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:37.630
So I was pretty much involved
in anti-war activities

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:42.203
at that time and in the student movement.

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:46.280
And I think that definitely
had an impact on me

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:51.280
in thinking about the importance of really

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:52.820
living according to some principles,

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:55.360
of not just going along with what society

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.720
or the government was
doing, but of forming

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.810
your own views and standing up for them.

00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:05.570
So when I got to Oxford, although as

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:07.400
an Australian in Britain I was not

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:10.860
as politically involved directly,

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:13.830
but when new issues came to my attention

00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:16.490
like the issue of the
treatment of animals,

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:20.050
for example, I think I was ready to say,

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:22.630
this is an important moral issue too

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:25.350
and we ought to take a stance about this,

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:28.880
we ought not to go along with what society

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:31.120
as a whole or the
mainstream thinks is right,

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.663
because it's not really right.

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:39.720
- So there is, when one
does a cursory examination

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:43.990
of your work, a kind of a link between

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:47.180
the philosophical foundations of your work

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:52.060
and the activism on certain issues

00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:53.530
that you've gotten involved in.

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:56.646
So it's really practical ethics

00:14:56.646 --> 00:14:57.930
(laughs) in a way, yeah.
- Oh, very definitely,

00:14:57.930 --> 00:14:58.763
there's a very direct link.

00:14:58.763 --> 00:15:03.520
I mean, I took up the
issue of animal liberation

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:05.070
not because I was an animal lover;

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:06.980
I was never really an animal lover,

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:09.410
I never particularly wanted to have pets

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:11.493
or dogs or cats living around me.

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:14.280
I took this up as an ethical issue.

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:16.760
It seemed to me that, once I learned

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:18.920
about the way we were treating animals,

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:21.790
not just the dogs and cats
that you see around homes

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:25.010
but in particular animals in farms,

00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:30.010
in factory farms and
used in research as well,

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:33.160
this just seemed to me
to be completely wrong,

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:36.830
this seemed to me to have no
ethical foundation at all.

00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:40.650
And so I took it up as an ethical issue,

00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:41.960
it was very directly an offshoot

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:45.033
of my philosophical interest in ethics.

00:15:46.185 --> 00:15:49.210
- I know that, as you
indicated in your lecture

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:53.380
yesterday, that some of your
thinking about Utilitarianism

00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:57.700
is changing as you do
do more and more work.

00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:01.960
But help us understand,
what are the foundations

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:06.860
of your thinking as a student and

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:10.240
a practitioner, I guess,
of Utilitarianism?

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:12.233
- Yes, and just to be clear,

00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:16.090
I'm not changing my thinking in the sense

00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:18.870
of abandoning Utilitarianism.
- No, right, yeah.

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:20.860
- There are some aspects as to what it is

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:23.850
that we ought to maximize
that I'm rethinking.

00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:25.560
But Utilitarianism is the view

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:28.840
that we ought to do what,
all things considered,

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.980
will have the best consequences,

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:34.560
and that still seems to
me to be absolutely right,

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:37.570
that ultimately we must
judge right and wrong

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:40.610
in terms of the
consequences of our action.

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:43.290
The question is, what
sort of consequences?

00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:46.650
Well, most of my life I've
been a preference Utilitarian;

00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:49.837
that means I think the
consequences we ought to look at

00:16:49.837 --> 00:16:51.790
are the extent to which our actions

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:56.400
satisfy the preferences of
all those conscious beings

00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:59.300
that have preferences about what we do,

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:02.350
as against thwarting or
frustrating those preferences.

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:06.300
I'm now perhaps leaning towards the view

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:08.870
that the consequences we
ought to be concerned about

00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:13.870
are reducing pain and maximizing
pleasure or happiness.

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:18.760
So it's, since obviously
most sentient beings

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:20.490
have preferences not to be in pain

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:24.040
and to have pleasurable sensations,

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:26.400
it's not a huge difference,
but philosophically

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:28.460
it is a significant difference.

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:32.580
- And there are important
features, as I understand it,

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:37.580
of Utilitarianism in the sense

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:41.680
that there is embedded here the idea

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:46.680
that you're egalitarian, in other words

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:50.610
these conclusions that you
reach really apply to everybody

00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:55.130
and it's hard to draw lines, even between

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:57.970
species, basically, is what you're saying.

00:17:57.970 --> 00:18:01.060
- Yes, certainly in one
sense I'm an egalitarian,

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:04.250
and that is that I think
that we ought to give

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:08.180
equal consideration to similar interests,

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:11.917
whether the interests
are those of, let's say

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:16.750
a man or a woman, or a
person of European descent

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:20.020
or of Asian or African
descent, and of course

00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:21.450
most people now would agree that

00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:23.330
we should not draw those distinctions.

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:27.900
But I would say also, if
there are non-human animals

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:30.070
that have interests that
we can roughly compare

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:34.023
with our own, their interests
are just as important as ours.

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:39.490
So that's egalitarianism
at a very basic level,

00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:42.570
equal consideration of similar interests.

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:45.476
It doesn't mean that I think that

00:18:45.476 --> 00:18:48.280
we ought to treat animals
the same as humans

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:50.120
or even that we ought to treat all humans

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:52.240
in exactly the same way; that will depend

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:54.340
on what their interests are and how

00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:58.770
we can best meet or
satisfy those interests.

00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:02.597
- And so it was this thinking that

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:09.100
furthered your embrace of what was

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:12.530
an emerging animal
liberation movement, namely

00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:15.563
that we can't just focus
on our species, basically.

00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:19.670
- Yes, but it may sound
immodest, but there was

00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:22.070
actually no emerging
animal liberation movement.

00:19:23.354 --> 00:19:25.230
I think my book came before the

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:27.930
emerging animal liberation movement.

00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:31.403
The term animal liberation
was not used or known at all;

00:19:31.403 --> 00:19:34.070
there was really only
a much more traditional

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:37.330
animal welfare movement,
what would be represented

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:39.740
in the United States by
the Humane Societies,

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:42.550
focusing largely on dogs and cats

00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:45.410
and perhaps some attractive wild animals

00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:47.310
or horses or something like that.

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:49.200
There was really no
movement that was concerned

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:52.223
about farm animals and factory farming,

00:19:54.113 --> 00:19:58.710
and there was an older
anti-vivisection movement,

00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:02.310
that's true, but it was
very much a minority;

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:04.963
most people would have
written it off as just cranky.

00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:09.610
So I think the animal,
what you could really call

00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:13.150
an animal liberation movement only emerged

00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:14.910
in the years following the publication

00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:18.110
of my book Animal Liberation.

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:21.210
- And let's explore that, and
I guess what I had in mind

00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:26.210
was, you had friends and
were in discussion about...

00:20:33.045 --> 00:20:34.500
Well, let me ask you this.

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:39.230
How did you come to see
the importance of this

00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:41.558
in a context where there was no movement

00:20:41.558 --> 00:20:45.470
but it was an idea, a set
of ideas were emerging

00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:48.610
among your friends and your circle

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:49.890
of acquaintances--
- Well, that's certainly true.

00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:51.920
I mean, I'm not going to claim any sort

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:55.783
of total philosophical originality here.

00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:01.310
I was fortunate enough to meet a few other

00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:05.630
graduate students at Oxford who were

00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:10.240
already thinking about
animals in a radical way,

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:14.090
and there was a book
published called Animals,

00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:17.740
Men and Morals, edited by
Stanley and Rosalind Godlovitch

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:22.010
and John Harris, who were
philosophers at Oxford

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:26.186
but graduate students, not academic staff,

00:21:26.186 --> 00:21:28.240
who had started to think about this

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:30.693
and they'd collected a number of essays.

00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:33.910
So yes, I was part of that group

00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:38.490
and I got a lot of thoughts
and ideas from them

00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:41.650
as well as sources of factual information

00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:44.333
about what was happening to
animals on factory farms.

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:47.610
Richard Ryder, who later
wrote an important book

00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:49.740
called Victims of Science about the use

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:52.790
of animals in science, was also at Oxford.

00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:55.140
So there were a number of people,

00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:58.540
but they hadn't actually
formed any kind of movement.

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:02.810
There were ideas that
I came in contact with

00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:06.630
and that really opened my eyes to the idea

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:11.630
that there was this vast
universe of sentient beings

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:14.400
who were just regarded as being

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:16.280
outside the sphere of morality,

00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:19.680
and really at that time virtually nobody

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:23.270
was seriously concerned
with their interests,

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:26.703
nobody spoke of animal rights
as if they had any rights.

00:22:28.533 --> 00:22:30.970
The focus was just on
humans and the assumption

00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:33.590
was that whatever happens to animals

00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:35.170
doesn't really matter that much.

00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:38.730
- So, and this is fascinating because,

00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:41.970
on the one hand, you had embraced certain

00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:45.240
philosophical assumptions, and they must

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:50.240
have helped activate you
to see the moral issue

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:55.063
in these kind of discussions
that you were around.

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:59.320
But then you took, talk to us a little

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:04.320
about your approach to the New York Review

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:08.510
to write a review of the book
that you discussed, which

00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:10.740
then led to your own work.
- Yes.

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:13.420
Okay, so as I mentioned, my friends

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:16.840
had edited this book,
Animals, Men and Morals,

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:20.330
and they had some hopes
that it would trigger

00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:23.480
a public discussion of
the treatment of animals,

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:26.310
but was published first in England

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:31.160
and it just sunk like a stone,
really, without a trace.

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:35.780
It was not reviewed by any
of the major newspapers

00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:39.780
or Sunday papers or
magazines, it was ignored,

00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:41.910
and this was just part of the
phenomenon that I mentioned,

00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:45.000
that nothing about animals
could really matter that much

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.310
so why bother reviewing a book

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:50.463
that talks about how we
ought to treat animals?

00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:54.220
So that was very
disappointing for my friends

00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:55.920
and very disappointing for me too.

00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:00.010
And then they got the news that there

00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:01.620
was gonna be an American
edition of their book,

00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:05.083
it was picked up by a relatively
small publisher, Taplinger.

00:24:06.143 --> 00:24:10.230
And I thought, well, is there
anything that could be done

00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:13.200
to prevent the book having the same fate

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:16.310
in the United States
that it had in Britain?

00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:19.790
And I got the idea, I was a regular reader

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:21.420
of the New York Review of Books,

00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:24.720
I got the idea that this was a place

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:27.940
that was open to radical
ideas, because they published

00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:32.380
a lot of radical articles
about the Vietnam War,

00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:36.650
about black liberation, about
gay liberation and so on;

00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:39.680
that it was widely read, it was the place

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:42.090
that anybody who was on the left

00:24:42.090 --> 00:24:44.760
or politically radical and had some

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:47.113
intellectual standards would go to.

00:24:48.353 --> 00:24:51.870
And so I just, you know, wrote
more or less out of the blue

00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:55.250
to the editor, Bob
Silvers; I'd had no contact

00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:57.220
with him before, he'd
certainly not heard of me.

00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:59.010
But I should mention that by this time

00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:00.680
I actually had an academic appointment

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:02.860
at Oxford, which may have been useful.

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:07.220
After I graduated in '71, I
became a college lecturer,

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:09.340
a very junior kind of
academic appointment,

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:10.970
but at least I could write on

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:14.690
Oxford University notepaper to him.

00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:17.820
And maybe that helped,
I don't really know.

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:20.600
I described the book, I described how

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:24.197
I would write about it, and that really

00:25:24.197 --> 00:25:27.540
this was calling for an
animal liberation movement

00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:31.290
parallel to the other
liberation movements,

00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:32.810
women's liberation, black liberation,

00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:35.623
gay liberation, that
we were familiar with.

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:39.350
And that was not,
incidentally, in the book,

00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:41.670
the book didn't really talk
about animal liberation

00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:44.463
as a movement, but that was
implicitly what it was doing.

00:25:45.311 --> 00:25:49.500
So Bob Silvers was open-minded enough

00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:52.867
to write back and say, "Well,
this sounds intriguing.

00:25:52.867 --> 00:25:54.787
"I'm not gonna make any
commitment until I see

00:25:54.787 --> 00:25:56.597
"your piece, but certainly send it to us,

00:25:56.597 --> 00:25:59.060
"we'd like to have a look at it."

00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:04.060
So I wrote a review essay, as was typical

00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:08.020
of the New York Review;
it doesn't just publish

00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:10.730
reviews that stick to the
book, it publishes essays

00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:14.070
around the book, that
develop the ideas of a book.

00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:17.200
I wrote that piece, I
called in Animal Liberation.

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:19.650
I said that the book
is a call for an animal

00:26:19.650 --> 00:26:22.490
liberation movement, a manifesto
for an animal liberation

00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:25.170
movement, and I was absolutely delighted

00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:28.190
when Silvers wrote back
and said he liked the piece

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:29.963
and they were gonna publish it.

00:26:29.963 --> 00:26:32.860
- And the essay was then
turned into a larger book.

00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:34.880
- That's right, then I
got a number of letters

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:36.780
after that was published, including one

00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:40.440
from an editor at a New York publisher

00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:42.266
saying, this is really intriguing,

00:26:42.266 --> 00:26:44.050
would you consider writing a book on this?

00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:48.130
So that was what led to
the book Animal Liberation.

00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:51.330
In an autobiographical
essay you talk about a man

00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:53.940
who in the course of this you later met

00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:56.630
in a course you were
teaching on animal lib

00:26:56.630 --> 00:27:01.630
named Henry Spira, and he
actually took the activism

00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:07.000
to a new level in the sense of, he was

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.960
I gather a labor organizer
in his past and so on

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:15.960
but actually began focusing
on getting corporations

00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:21.470
to change their policies using animals

00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:24.570
and testing cosmetics
and such other things.

00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:26.230
- Yeah, that's right.

00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:28.310
So just to follow my career, I'd had

00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:31.000
this two-year junior college
lectureship at Oxford

00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:36.190
and although my wife and I, since she

00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:38.670
came from Melbourne as well,
were planning to go back

00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:40.360
to Australia eventually, we wanted

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:42.110
to raise our children in Australia,

00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:45.920
I had an invitation
from New York University

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:48.190
based partly on that piece I wrote

00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:50.410
for the New York Review
and another article I wrote

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:53.270
called Famine, Affluence, and
Morality about global poverty

00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:56.750
that was published in a
more academic journal,

00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:59.677
so I had an invitation to come there

00:27:59.677 --> 00:28:04.470
for a temporary assistant professorship.

00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:08.700
So I went to New York University

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:12.850
and I was working on writing
the book Animal Liberation.

00:28:12.850 --> 00:28:17.850
And I was invited to teach a
continuing education course

00:28:17.967 --> 00:28:21.280
so I decided to use the
draft material that I had

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:25.140
for the book and advertise this course,

00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:27.700
and I can't remember, maybe 15,

00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:30.073
20 people enrolled in the course.

00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:33.060
And there was one man who really stood out

00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:35.310
because whereas those people enrolled

00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:38.470
were predominantly female,
women were more interested

00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:40.490
in animals at that time, I guess more open

00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:43.260
to that kind of what might have been seen

00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:48.260
as a sentimental view, and
also they were generally

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:51.170
pretty polished, I guess sophisticated,

00:28:51.170 --> 00:28:53.083
you might say upper-class people.

00:28:54.130 --> 00:28:56.887
There was a man who just from his accent

00:28:56.887 --> 00:29:00.010
had much more of a
working-class background,

00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:04.100
spoke in a rougher way,
but was really interested

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:09.100
in the idea that animals
were an exploited underclass,

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:11.540
because that was where he had come from,

00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:14.950
he'd come from, as you
mentioned, the labor movement

00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:17.830
and the idea that the
working class is exploited,

00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:20.000
and he actually had got the point

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.480
that just as the wealthy upper class

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:26.670
tend to exploit the working class,

00:29:26.670 --> 00:29:30.730
so the human species exploits animals.

00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:35.730
And at the end of the
course, he stood up and said,

00:29:35.877 --> 00:29:37.327
"Well, you know, this
has all been very good,

00:29:37.327 --> 00:29:39.667
"all this theoretical
discussion, all very interesting,

00:29:39.667 --> 00:29:43.757
"but how about we actually try
and do something about this,

00:29:43.757 --> 00:29:46.277
"and if anybody from this group would like

00:29:46.277 --> 00:29:50.047
"to talk with me about
what we can really do,

00:29:50.047 --> 00:29:53.510
"you can meet at my apartment"
at such and such a time.

00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:57.110
So a little group did go
to meet at his apartment

00:29:57.110 --> 00:30:00.980
and they started these campaigns, which,

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:03.090
actually, the first was
not against a corporation,

00:30:03.090 --> 00:30:05.690
it was against the American
Museum of Natural History,

00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:08.020
which is a big New York institution,

00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:12.240
right there on Central Park, very public,

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:13.900
but what the public who went in to look

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:16.580
at the dinosaur skeletons did not know

00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:19.040
is that in the upper floors, experiments

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:21.050
were being conducted on cats that involved

00:30:21.050 --> 00:30:22.763
mutilating them and blinding them.

00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:27.900
And when Spira got FOI
information about this

00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:30.851
and publicized it, he started a campaign

00:30:30.851 --> 00:30:33.460
that was the first campaign, I think,

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:35.500
in the history of the United States

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:38.400
to actually stop a series
of animal experiments.

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:39.970
Although the anti-vivisection movement

00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:42.225
had been going for a century or more,

00:30:42.225 --> 00:30:44.677
never before had it actually succeeded

00:30:44.677 --> 00:30:48.120
in stopping a set of animal experiments.

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:50.270
So that was the first
success, and then they went on

00:30:50.270 --> 00:30:53.367
to campaign against
cosmetics testing on animals,

00:30:53.367 --> 00:30:56.800
and they persuaded Revlon
and Avon and other companies

00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:59.420
to put money into developing alternatives

00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:02.450
to the use of animals in a
lot of cosmetics testing.

00:31:02.450 --> 00:31:05.757
- So there's a very interesting chain here

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:11.616
in the sense of, you have
a philosophical foundation

00:31:11.616 --> 00:31:16.616
that goes back to
Utilitarianism, the nurturing

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:20.080
of the application of these ideas

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:23.160
really in the formulation of a problem

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:26.410
because of this group you
were interacting with,

00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:30.758
then the publication,
but then the hard work

00:31:30.758 --> 00:31:34.900
of organizing in a way to have an impact.

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:39.220
So it's an interesting chain, because

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:44.220
the notion, you have
written on world poverty,

00:31:47.151 --> 00:31:50.250
you've written on many
things, but in the case

00:31:50.250 --> 00:31:54.150
of animal rights and world policy,

00:31:54.150 --> 00:31:56.960
there has been a subsequent effort

00:31:56.960 --> 00:32:01.910
to actually practice practical ethics,

00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:03.693
(laughs) namely,
- Right.

00:32:03.693 --> 00:32:06.970
- To apply them and to make it happen.

00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:09.100
- Yes, that's certainly true,
and I think you're right

00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:11.100
that there was a very clear connection

00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:14.540
between my Utilitarianism, my view

00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:17.430
about both animals and global poverty,

00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:19.420
that there was a lot of
suffering going on here

00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:22.357
that was unnecessary and could be stopped,

00:32:22.357 --> 00:32:26.600
and eventually that it was
necessary to take steps,

00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:29.270
not just to write a book
and publicize these things

00:32:29.270 --> 00:32:31.170
but to really try to find

00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:34.080
mechanisms of bringing about change.

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:36.680
And obviously I'm delighted
that that has happened

00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:38.811
in the case of the animal movement,

00:32:38.811 --> 00:32:40.920
and to some extent is happening

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:42.730
in the case of global poverty as well.

00:32:42.730 --> 00:32:46.713
- And there, how do you account for

00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:52.030
what has happened with regard
to the poverty movement,

00:32:52.030 --> 00:32:55.780
because here in a way you're depending

00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:59.730
on existing organizations,
and identifying them

00:32:59.730 --> 00:33:04.730
and making them known to
people who are motivated

00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:08.140
by the idea that you have, which has

00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:11.200
a foundation, again, in Utilitarianism?

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:12.730
- Yes, that's right.

00:33:12.730 --> 00:33:14.740
They are slightly different,
because as I said,

00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:17.237
there was really no
animal liberation movement

00:33:17.237 --> 00:33:20.410
and it was necessary to
found new organizations,

00:33:20.410 --> 00:33:23.320
which is what Henry Spira did, and also,

00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:26.050
for example, Ingrid
Newkirk and Alex Pacheco

00:33:26.050 --> 00:33:28.560
founding People for the
Ethical Treatment of Animals,

00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:31.830
and various other
organizations that started,

00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:35.340
because the older organizations,
the Humane Societies

00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:37.960
and the RSPCAs in Britain, were generally

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:40.000
seen as too conservative to change.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.680
I mean, fortunately they have changed

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:45.320
over the years to some extent, but there

00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:47.480
there were new organizations founded.

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:50.230
In the case of global poverty,

00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:54.640
most of the organizations
were okay, you know,

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:58.080
they were doing the job,
organizations like Oxfam

00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:01.770
and Save the Children
and UNICEF and so on.

00:34:01.770 --> 00:34:03.000
They were generally doing the job,

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.800
but they didn't have the kind
of resources going to them,

00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:09.360
and what I was trying to
do was to get the idea

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:12.570
that it is the responsibility of any of us

00:34:12.570 --> 00:34:15.730
who have money to spare,
any of us who are living

00:34:15.730 --> 00:34:19.310
at a kind of level where
we can think nothing

00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:23.780
of spending, you know, 30 or 50 dollars

00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:26.260
on a meal at a restaurant
or going to the theater

00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:29.390
or something like that, when these amounts

00:34:29.390 --> 00:34:31.360
might be all that a family has to live on

00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:34.010
for a month in the developing countries,

00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:36.840
and it's the lack of that kind of amount

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:39.270
that might be a life or
death difference in terms

00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:43.140
of getting medical care for a sick child.

00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:46.720
So what I think was lacking
there was the awareness

00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:49.440
in the general public
that if we want to live

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:53.050
an ethical life, we need not only

00:34:53.050 --> 00:34:55.550
to think about, you know,
not cheating and stealing

00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:58.520
and harming those near
us, but we need to think

00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:00.410
about what our responsibilities are

00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:03.100
to help those who, through no fault

00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:06.770
of their own, are living in dire poverty

00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:10.861
where their living conditions are just not

00:35:10.861 --> 00:35:13.300
what we would regard as a decent minimum

00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:16.560
and their children may die
from things like diarrhea

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:19.820
or measles, diseases which we can prevent

00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:22.360
or easily cure in the developed world

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:24.270
but which they don't have the resources

00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:26.487
to prevent or cure in
the developing world.

00:35:26.487 --> 00:35:30.910
- And in this particular
case, the added dimension

00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:35.470
of the Web creates a place where people

00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:38.630
can find out about your idea and actually

00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:42.380
link to organizations
that would allow them

00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:45.560
to implement their change in thinking

00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:50.050
as a result of the
philosophical principle,

00:35:50.050 --> 00:35:51.550
shall we say, that you're working with.

00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:53.420
- Yes, exactly, that's right.

00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:56.250
So I wrote a book called
The Life You Can Save

00:35:56.250 --> 00:35:59.700
and I set up a website,
thelifeyoucansave.com,

00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:02.290
and people can go there
and they can find out

00:36:02.290 --> 00:36:06.260
about my ideas, they can see
suggested levels of giving

00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:09.873
that are proportionate to
people's income levels,

00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:14.630
and they can find links to organizations

00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:19.440
that I regard as highly effective
in reducing global poverty

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:21.090
that they can make those donations to,

00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:24.187
so it is a kind of a one-shop stop

00:36:24.187 --> 00:36:27.570
for people who are interested
in what they can do

00:36:27.570 --> 00:36:29.463
to help to reduce global poverty.

00:36:31.287 --> 00:36:36.050
- This interesting combination
of philosophical principles

00:36:36.050 --> 00:36:39.408
with activism leads to a question of,

00:36:39.408 --> 00:36:43.190
what are the skills and temperament

00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:45.690
that it takes, on the one
hand to be a philosopher

00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:48.550
and on the other hand to be an activist?

00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:49.670
- Yeah, that is an interesting question,

00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:51.060
'cause they're not exactly the same.

00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:53.820
I mean, I think the problem
is, as a philosopher

00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:57.890
you're very aware of all the
nuances of your positions,

00:36:57.890 --> 00:37:01.900
of all the possible objections and how

00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:03.840
you might counter those objections,

00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:07.860
and essentially you're
aware of the complications

00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:09.740
of defending any ethical view.

00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:12.610
Whereas as an activist, it's often better

00:37:12.610 --> 00:37:15.910
to have a somewhat simpler approach

00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:18.060
and just to focus on the main things

00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:21.710
and not get too complicated
or nuanced in your approach.

00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:23.670
From a campaigning point of view

00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:28.320
in reaching a wide audience,
it's perhaps better

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:31.800
to see things in somewhat
more black and white terms.

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:35.080
So I've often had that kind of conflict.

00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:38.140
I mean, I am professionally a philosopher,

00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:43.070
but I have been involved
in many organizations

00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:45.140
that are campaigning
organizations, particularly

00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:49.093
in the animal movement but
also regarding global poverty.

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:53.610
And I do sometimes have
to sort of (laughs)

00:37:53.610 --> 00:37:55.853
say to myself in a way, yeah, you know,

00:37:56.810 --> 00:37:59.190
if you were writing this philosophy book

00:37:59.190 --> 00:38:00.830
you would write it slightly differently,

00:38:00.830 --> 00:38:03.220
but since what you're writing is a leaflet

00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:06.233
or a statement to issue to the media,

00:38:06.233 --> 00:38:09.760
you have to be a little
more straightforward

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:12.850
and simpler in terms of doing that.

00:38:12.850 --> 00:38:14.760
So that's one difference.

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:18.770
The other thing is I think it takes

00:38:18.770 --> 00:38:22.410
a fair amount of
persistence as a campaigner

00:38:22.410 --> 00:38:26.640
to get through to people and
to make those breakthroughs.

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:28.290
So you have to be prepared to be there

00:38:28.290 --> 00:38:31.210
for the long haul, and
that's quite important.

00:38:31.210 --> 00:38:34.950
I mean, I said fairly quickly
that Henry Spira's group

00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:37.420
managed to stop those
experiments at the Museum

00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:40.380
of Natural History, but they
were outside that museum

00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:43.380
every weekend for, I
don't remember exactly

00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:45.460
but I think it was more than a year

00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:48.000
before they did stop those experiments.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.900
So it did take a fair
amount of persistence

00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:54.090
to actually make that breakthrough,

00:38:54.090 --> 00:38:57.390
and that's really
important as a campaigner

00:38:57.390 --> 00:38:59.380
and it's something different
from what philosophers

00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:02.150
might do, who might say,
well, as long as this

00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:03.530
interests me I'll keep working on this,

00:39:03.530 --> 00:39:05.380
but once it no longer interests me

00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:07.630
I'll go and work on something else.

00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:10.856
- In the case of these
books for public discourse,

00:39:10.856 --> 00:39:15.400
it really requires, on
the one hand a clarity

00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:20.400
of writing and on the other, sound, basic

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:24.890
philosophical principles, 'cause

00:39:24.890 --> 00:39:26.550
they both seem to be at work here.

00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:29.760
- Yes, they are, and that
conflict is definitely there

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:31.290
depending on what audience
you're writing for.

00:39:31.290 --> 00:39:33.600
So for instance, my book Practical Ethics

00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:37.740
was really written to be
used in philosophy courses

00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:40.020
and it tries to look at the objections

00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:43.030
as much as you reasonably
can and discuss them

00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:46.610
in a fairly philosophical way.

00:39:46.610 --> 00:39:49.050
If you look at either Animal Liberation

00:39:49.050 --> 00:39:53.080
or the book about global
poverty, The Life You Can Save,

00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:55.450
they were both explicitly
written for a broader

00:39:55.450 --> 00:39:59.130
audience, so the philosophy in them

00:39:59.130 --> 00:40:03.460
is not so detailed, not so complex.

00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:04.990
It's still there, and I certainly still

00:40:04.990 --> 00:40:06.510
stand by everything that I say,

00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:08.730
but if you were writing an academic book

00:40:08.730 --> 00:40:12.770
it would be more complicated, I suppose,

00:40:12.770 --> 00:40:16.257
whereas what I wanted to do was to really

00:40:16.257 --> 00:40:18.610
state the basic essentials and then

00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:20.570
go into some of the practical aspects

00:40:20.570 --> 00:40:24.090
of the facts of the
situation that are relevant

00:40:24.090 --> 00:40:26.480
and what we can do about these situations.

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:28.790
- Now, another element of Utilitarianism

00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:32.790
is this notion of being
responsible for acts

00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:37.020
and omissions, basically,
and it's in the area

00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:42.020
of medical ethics, where you've

00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:45.200
also done path-breaking work,

00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:48.890
that those aspects come into play.

00:40:48.890 --> 00:40:53.260
Let's talk a little about
that, because in that area

00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:58.200
you were also kind of early into the game,

00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:02.730
so to speak, of looking at the choices

00:41:02.730 --> 00:41:05.660
in medicine that were being created

00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:07.780
by the development of technology.

00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:11.530
So technology seems to
be an important driver

00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:15.870
in that area, where we're
suddenly confronting

00:41:15.870 --> 00:41:18.460
kind of important philosophical issues

00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:20.620
which nobody wants to address.

00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:22.010
- Yes, absolutely.

00:41:22.010 --> 00:41:26.730
I did get into bioethics
in its fairly early days,

00:41:26.730 --> 00:41:29.980
it existed, but fairly early on,

00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:33.480
and I was the founding
director of the first

00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:36.913
Australian bioethics center,
at Monash University.

00:41:38.222 --> 00:41:41.670
And technology certainly
played a role in that

00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:45.370
because Australia, and even specifically

00:41:45.370 --> 00:41:47.650
the scientists at Monash University,

00:41:47.650 --> 00:41:50.853
were among the pioneers
of in-vitro fertilization.

00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:55.150
The very first in-vitro
fertilization child

00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:58.950
was conceived in England
as a result of work

00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:04.800
by Edwards and Steptoe, but the second

00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:08.650
and third, I think it was,
IVF births were in Australia,

00:42:08.650 --> 00:42:10.750
and the Australian team
was also the first to show

00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:14.090
that you could freeze
embryos and thaw them

00:42:14.090 --> 00:42:17.440
and still have sound,
healthy children from them.

00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:20.340
So there were a lot of
pioneering steps that were taken,

00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:21.870
and for that reason, there was a lot

00:42:21.870 --> 00:42:26.680
of ethical interest in
what was happening here.

00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:30.500
And so the university supported me

00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:34.110
in setting up a center that
would study these questions,

00:42:34.110 --> 00:42:37.031
and to some extent, I suppose, provide

00:42:37.031 --> 00:42:40.010
a level of discussion that
was lacking at the time

00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:42.410
in the community, that there wasn't really

00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:44.900
a lot of really serious
reflection on these issues.

00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:46.820
There were heated statements from,

00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:48.520
one the one hand the scientists

00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:51.360
and on the other hand,
particularly I suppose

00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:53.950
religious groups that
were opposed to this,

00:42:53.950 --> 00:42:56.230
but there wasn't anything very much

00:42:56.230 --> 00:43:00.400
that was looking at it at
a higher, more thoughtful,

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:03.680
more philosophical level
of ethical discussion.

00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:06.700
So that's what I was trying
to contribute to that field.

00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:09.313
- And here the,

00:43:10.890 --> 00:43:15.510
especially in the birth of children

00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:21.537
who were incapacitated

00:43:24.270 --> 00:43:26.880
through no fault of their own,

00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:29.410
there was a failure or a debate

00:43:29.410 --> 00:43:34.260
within the medical community to make

00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:37.890
a decision about continuing life

00:43:37.890 --> 00:43:41.680
versus discontinuing life, and this was

00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:46.600
a whole moral area that
had to be explored.

00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:49.280
- Yes, that was certainly another issue

00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:52.910
where again, technology played a role.

00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:55.190
Having set up the center
at Monash University,

00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:57.920
were approached by
doctors who were dealing

00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:02.920
with newborn intensive care,
and one of the conditions

00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:07.210
that they were concerned
about was spina bifida,

00:44:07.210 --> 00:44:09.090
which at that stage was much more common

00:44:09.090 --> 00:44:11.440
than it is now because the connection

00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:14.903
with taking folic acid during
pregnancy was not known,

00:44:14.903 --> 00:44:19.890
and also there was less
prenatal diagnosis.

00:44:19.890 --> 00:44:22.990
So we had these babies born with

00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:25.000
some very severe case of spina bifida.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.170
And if they'd been born in
the '50s they would have died,

00:44:28.170 --> 00:44:31.070
because there wasn't the
technology to keep them alive.

00:44:31.070 --> 00:44:36.070
But in the '60s, doctors
developed the means

00:44:36.130 --> 00:44:39.363
to keep them alive, and
then having done that,

00:44:40.330 --> 00:44:44.313
in particular a doctor
called John Lobur in England,

00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:48.570
who was in an area with a
very high rate of spina bifida

00:44:48.570 --> 00:44:51.200
and he had through his technology

00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:56.040
saved the lives of maybe
hundreds of these children.

00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:58.410
But then they kept coming
back to his clinic,

00:44:58.410 --> 00:45:00.430
they kept needing more medical attention,

00:45:00.430 --> 00:45:02.540
they need repeated
operations; some of them

00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:06.103
had 40 operations by the time
they were 10 or 12 years old.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:10.490
They were often still
very severely disabled,

00:45:10.490 --> 00:45:14.020
in some cases with
significant intellectual

00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:16.760
disability as well, and
he started to revaluate

00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:19.240
what he'd been doing, and saying,

00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:21.640
well, was it really
right to save the lives

00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:24.790
of these children, should we let them die?

00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:29.190
And so Australian doctors
were also troubled

00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:31.340
by those issues, and
they came to talk to us

00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:36.260
at the Monash center to get
some ethical discussion going.

00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:37.590
And we looked at what they were doing

00:45:37.590 --> 00:45:41.510
and we had to agree that
there were some cases

00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:44.200
where it was not actually desirable

00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:46.150
to prolong the lives of these children.

00:45:47.010 --> 00:45:48.620
But the only thing that they could do

00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:50.040
was simply not treat them and hope

00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:51.980
that they would die fairly soon,

00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:54.360
and that's where this
distinction between acts

00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:56.020
and omissions that you mentioned comes in,

00:45:56.020 --> 00:45:58.830
because as a Utilitarian, it seemed to me

00:45:58.830 --> 00:46:01.040
that once you make the decision

00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:04.680
that it's better that
this infant should die,

00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:07.110
then there's no real moral difference

00:46:07.110 --> 00:46:09.940
between allowing the infant to die

00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:13.448
through basically benign neglect

00:46:13.448 --> 00:46:16.560
and giving the child a lethal injection.

00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:17.810
And in fact, there's a lot to be said

00:46:17.810 --> 00:46:19.470
in favor of the lethal injection,

00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:21.960
because then the child will die swiftly

00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:24.210
and without further
suffering, whereas otherwise

00:46:24.210 --> 00:46:26.460
the child may linger for weeks or months

00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:29.560
in a fairly distressed
state; very distressing

00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:32.283
for the parents and
hospital staff as well.

00:46:33.130 --> 00:46:36.406
So we were saying, look, if
this is what you're going to do,

00:46:36.406 --> 00:46:38.070
and we think it sometimes is justified

00:46:38.070 --> 00:46:41.300
in deciding that it's better
the child should not live,

00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:44.590
then why not allow doctors to actively

00:46:44.590 --> 00:46:46.090
end the lives of the children.

00:46:47.090 --> 00:46:50.740
- And in some of what
you wrote at this time

00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:55.740
you point out that there was
a definitional issue here,

00:46:56.610 --> 00:47:01.610
that the definitions that the doctors

00:47:02.350 --> 00:47:06.820
would come up with wouldn't
hold as circumstances changed.

00:47:06.820 --> 00:47:08.430
So there was a whole effort to say,

00:47:08.430 --> 00:47:12.420
well, we can do things
if there's brain death,

00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:14.847
but then that whole definition

00:47:14.847 --> 00:47:19.730
seemed less and less, had to be redefined.

00:47:19.730 --> 00:47:21.810
- Well, I mean, around this period

00:47:21.810 --> 00:47:24.663
death was being redefined
in terms of brain death,

00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:28.350
because hospitals didn't know what to do

00:47:28.350 --> 00:47:32.410
with patients who could be supported

00:47:32.410 --> 00:47:34.740
in the sense that their
hearts could be kept beating,

00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:36.590
blood could be kept circulating,

00:47:36.590 --> 00:47:38.870
but there was no brain activity at all

00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:41.470
and there was absolutely no prospect

00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:44.610
that they would every recover in any way.

00:47:44.610 --> 00:47:49.540
So starting out with a Harvard committee

00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:51.180
that examined this and then moving on

00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:54.090
to a President's Commission
that looked at it,

00:47:54.090 --> 00:47:57.350
essentially the definition
of death got changed

00:47:57.350 --> 00:47:59.563
to declare these people dead.

00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:02.760
To my point of view,
while that undoubtedly

00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:05.270
had a desirable result,
because it's true that

00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:08.560
there was no point in keeping
these people on respirators

00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:10.420
when there was no prospect of them ever

00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:13.950
recovering consciousness, I thought it was

00:48:13.950 --> 00:48:16.740
in a way a slightly
underhand way of achieving

00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:19.130
that objective, that it
would have been more honest

00:48:19.130 --> 00:48:21.110
to say, not that they're dead,

00:48:21.110 --> 00:48:24.780
because their bodies definitely
seemed to be still alive,

00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:28.930
but to say that there was no benefit

00:48:28.930 --> 00:48:30.620
to keeping them alive,
that although they were

00:48:30.620 --> 00:48:33.670
living human beings, it was
permissible to end their lives

00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:38.670
because without any prospect
of consciousness returning

00:48:38.830 --> 00:48:41.621
there was no value or benefit to anyone,

00:48:41.621 --> 00:48:45.433
neither to them nor to anyone
else, in keeping them alive.

00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:51.160
- In this bioethics area, it would seem

00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:55.430
that the whole problems we're
having with medical costs

00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:58.990
are gonna open up a whole new domain

00:48:58.990 --> 00:49:03.570
where we have to weigh this other value

00:49:03.570 --> 00:49:08.490
of how much it costs and
should we be doing things

00:49:08.490 --> 00:49:12.380
that just prolong life for a short time.

00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:14.070
Talk a little about that, I mean,

00:49:14.070 --> 00:49:17.720
is this gonna be the next area of,

00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:20.390
well, it probably already is an area

00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:25.390
which bioethics are gonna
have to define the questions

00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:27.030
and come up with some, at least

00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:29.620
philosophically, with the answers.

00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:33.050
- It already is an area,
although in the United States

00:49:33.050 --> 00:49:35.770
there's a reluctance to
talk about it openly.

00:49:35.770 --> 00:49:38.300
But in other countries,
in Britain or Australia

00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:40.790
or in Europe, I think
it's already understood

00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:45.790
that healthcare resources are
limited, they're not infinite,

00:49:46.190 --> 00:49:49.380
and we ought to do the
most good that we can

00:49:49.380 --> 00:49:52.430
with the resources we have,
and doing the most good

00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:56.575
that we can is probably not using

00:49:56.575 --> 00:49:59.740
all the medical technology at our disposal

00:49:59.740 --> 00:50:02.110
to prolong the life of somebody

00:50:02.110 --> 00:50:06.410
who is clearly dying
and is going to be dying

00:50:06.410 --> 00:50:10.530
within a week or a month,
has poor quality of life,

00:50:10.530 --> 00:50:13.870
in some cases may have
dementia or other conditions

00:50:13.870 --> 00:50:17.210
like that, that this is not
getting good value for our money

00:50:17.210 --> 00:50:19.970
and it's not even good for the patient.

00:50:19.970 --> 00:50:23.790
So the idea that we are going to have

00:50:23.790 --> 00:50:26.830
to ration our resources
is something that is

00:50:26.830 --> 00:50:28.550
generally accepted in most countries,

00:50:28.550 --> 00:50:31.130
and it's only in the United
States that there's been

00:50:31.130 --> 00:50:35.960
a very slow and reluctant
acceptance of that idea

00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:37.500
that healthcare resources, even

00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:41.660
in a wealthy society, are not infinite.

00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:45.004
- I think this was in your
autobiographical essay,

00:50:45.004 --> 00:50:49.857
you talk about the problem
of "imperfect information,

00:50:49.857 --> 00:50:52.207
"powerful interests, and a desire

00:50:52.207 --> 00:50:56.890
"not to know disturbing
facts," I think you

00:50:56.890 --> 00:51:01.890
identified those as problems,
once philosophically

00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:05.960
you've grappled with a
problem, to why you don't see

00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:09.400
the kind of improvement you might want to

00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:12.110
when you link the philosophical

00:51:12.110 --> 00:51:15.040
conclusions to a kind of activism.

00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:17.340
- Yeah, I think that's write, and I guess

00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:19.610
that quote that you just read applies

00:51:19.610 --> 00:51:21.140
particularly to the animal area,

00:51:21.140 --> 00:51:24.900
because you have powerful
corporate interests,

00:51:24.900 --> 00:51:27.120
you have agribusiness, huge corporations

00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:30.093
that have vested interests
in continuing this system,

00:51:30.093 --> 00:51:32.240
and also you have consumers who are just

00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:34.890
in the habit of eating animal products

00:51:34.890 --> 00:51:38.470
and would really rather not
know about how they're produced

00:51:38.470 --> 00:51:41.410
because they kind of have a vague sense

00:51:41.410 --> 00:51:43.790
that if they do know,
they'll get uncomfortable

00:51:43.790 --> 00:51:47.160
with what they're eating,
so better just to turn away,

00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:48.840
why do I have to watch that video

00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:53.840
of intensive pig farms
or cruelty to chickens

00:51:54.410 --> 00:51:57.073
or laying hens on the farms.

00:51:58.110 --> 00:52:00.650
So people don't like to
watch this sort of thing,

00:52:00.650 --> 00:52:03.410
and that what makes it
difficult to actually reach

00:52:03.410 --> 00:52:06.390
the public, to get them just to know

00:52:06.390 --> 00:52:08.810
basic things like, how
is your food produced?

00:52:08.810 --> 00:52:12.090
I mean, that seems to me clearly
an ethical responsibility.

00:52:12.090 --> 00:52:13.320
If you're going down to the supermarket

00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:16.290
to vote with your dollars in favor

00:52:16.290 --> 00:52:19.743
of producing pork or chicken for instance,

00:52:20.855 --> 00:52:24.130
oughtn't you to know what
happened to the pigs and chickens

00:52:24.130 --> 00:52:25.730
before they were turned into those

00:52:25.730 --> 00:52:27.833
plastic-wrapped packages on the shelf?

00:52:29.052 --> 00:52:32.650
- So it seems that you really

00:52:32.650 --> 00:52:36.130
are committed in your life's work

00:52:36.130 --> 00:52:40.370
to the application of reason to in a way

00:52:40.370 --> 00:52:44.320
change the world by sorting through

00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:48.360
the problems and the
confusion that deny us

00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:50.540
clarity so we can think about it.

00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:51.930
- Yeah, I think that puts it very well.

00:52:51.930 --> 00:52:54.100
I certainly am committed to
the application of reason,

00:52:54.100 --> 00:52:57.190
not just to our thought
but to the way we live.

00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:58.370
- Now, let me read you,

00:52:58.370 --> 00:53:01.040
one last thing, I wanna
read you a quote, actually,

00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:04.050
which came from an interview on 60 Minutes

00:53:04.050 --> 00:53:06.770
which I thought after exploring

00:53:06.770 --> 00:53:08.720
your work was a nice summary.

00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:11.267
You said to Dan Rather, "My ethics come

00:53:11.267 --> 00:53:14.337
"from considering the
consequences of my actions

00:53:14.337 --> 00:53:16.797
"for all those that get affected by them.

00:53:16.797 --> 00:53:18.457
"I am prepared to say that in a sense,

00:53:18.457 --> 00:53:21.177
"my ethics is a kind of Golden Rule.

00:53:21.177 --> 00:53:23.737
"The idea of saying, how would you like it

00:53:23.737 --> 00:53:26.647
"if this were done to you, is fundamental

00:53:26.647 --> 00:53:29.237
"to my sense of ethics because I think

00:53:29.237 --> 00:53:31.477
"that's what ethics is about, it's about

00:53:31.477 --> 00:53:33.917
"getting beyond yourself and looking

00:53:33.917 --> 00:53:37.040
"at the effect that
you're having on others."

00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:40.560
- Absolutely, yes, I certainly
still hold exactly that view.

00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:43.590
I think that the Golden
Rule is a wonderful tool

00:53:43.590 --> 00:53:48.260
for thinking about what
you're doing ethically

00:53:48.260 --> 00:53:51.060
rather than just from a
self-interested point of view.

00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:55.410
And it ought to be putting
ourselves in the position

00:53:55.410 --> 00:53:57.600
of all those affected by our action,

00:53:57.600 --> 00:54:02.300
whether they are like
us, let's say, you know,

00:54:02.300 --> 00:54:06.210
in my case, white males
in developed countries,

00:54:06.210 --> 00:54:11.210
or whether they're
African women, let's say,

00:54:12.117 --> 00:54:15.380
living in poverty, or even, to the extent

00:54:15.380 --> 00:54:17.580
that we can understand what it's like,

00:54:17.580 --> 00:54:22.580
if they are a sow living in
a narrow stall on concrete,

00:54:24.220 --> 00:54:27.500
unable to walk around
for most of their life,

00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:31.900
or a hen unable to stretch
their wings in a cage.

00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:34.485
We have to do our best to
put ourselves in the position

00:54:34.485 --> 00:54:39.400
of these beings as well, because they are

00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:44.000
sentient beings and they
are affected by our actions.

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:45.300
- And then one final question,

00:54:45.300 --> 00:54:49.350
how would you advise students
to prepare for the future

00:54:49.350 --> 00:54:54.350
if they wanna combine
philosophy with activism?

00:54:57.520 --> 00:55:01.350
- Well, I would say live
your lives to some purpose

00:55:01.350 --> 00:55:04.030
and think about career choice.

00:55:04.030 --> 00:55:07.498
There's actually quite a new organization

00:55:07.498 --> 00:55:10.290
that has been set up to encourage people

00:55:10.290 --> 00:55:13.350
to think about career
choices in an ethical way.

00:55:13.350 --> 00:55:16.860
It's called 80,000 Hours
because that's roughly

00:55:16.860 --> 00:55:20.360
the amount of time that
students from graduating

00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:23.290
might spend on their career
throughout their lives.

00:55:23.290 --> 00:55:28.290
So if you look up 80,000,
just written as numerals,

00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:31.039
80000hours.com, I think it is,

00:55:31.039 --> 00:55:33.010
you'll get some interesting discussion

00:55:33.010 --> 00:55:35.710
about ethical career choices.

00:55:35.710 --> 00:55:38.220
And in contrast, many people think, well,

00:55:38.220 --> 00:55:41.900
somebody like me would
advocate going into NGOs,

00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:45.480
working for Oxfam or working
for People for the Ethical

00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:48.210
Treatment of Animals or
an organization like that.

00:55:48.210 --> 00:55:49.990
Well, yes, they may be good choices,

00:55:49.990 --> 00:55:52.810
but if you're really committed, say,

00:55:52.810 --> 00:55:55.800
to reducing global poverty,
there's some arguments

00:55:55.800 --> 00:55:58.180
that say that if you have the ability

00:55:58.180 --> 00:55:59.990
to earn large amounts of money

00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:03.330
by going into investment banking,

00:56:03.330 --> 00:56:06.170
as long as you maintain
your values and commitment

00:56:06.170 --> 00:56:09.830
and give away what you don't need,

00:56:09.830 --> 00:56:13.320
which will be a very large
sum if you're successful,

00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:16.010
to organizations fighting global poverty

00:56:16.010 --> 00:56:18.823
or protecting the environment
or working for animals,

00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:22.268
you could maybe be even more effective

00:56:22.268 --> 00:56:23.650
in those sorts of careers.

00:56:23.650 --> 00:56:26.880
So it's not as obvious as you might think,

00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:28.660
what young people ought to do

00:56:28.660 --> 00:56:31.010
or ought to focus on
doing when they graduate.

00:56:31.010 --> 00:56:33.540
- Professor Singer, on that positive note,

00:56:33.540 --> 00:56:34.620
thank you very much

00:56:34.620 --> 00:56:35.906
for coming on our program.
- Thank you, it's been

00:56:35.906 --> 00:56:37.316
great talking to you.

00:56:37.316 --> 00:56:38.730
- And thank you very much for joining us

00:56:38.730 --> 00:56:41.126
for this Conversation with History.

00:56:41.126 --> 00:56:43.709
(upbeat music)
