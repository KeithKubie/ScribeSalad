00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:17.250
When Neil Armstrong set his left boot on the
surface of the moon on July 21, 1969, becoming

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.810
the first person to ever walk on the moon.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:28.869
He then spoke some of the most famous words
in the history of mankind, “That’s one

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.680
small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.”

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.250
So true, so brilliant, so inspirational yet…so
contradicting?

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.980
The word “man” and “mankind” are used
synonymously, meaning that the oh-so-famous

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.320
quote quite simply put was, “That’s one
small step for man, one giant leap for man.”

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.320
Huh?

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.049
A one-lettered indefinite article is all it
would take to turn this quote into the inspirational

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:56.119
words our brains all process when we hear
them.

00:00:56.119 --> 00:01:02.229
That article is “a”- “One small step
for “a” man, one giant leap for mankind.”

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:06.140
That is how most people interpret his words
and, according to Neil Armstrong, those are

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.090
the words he intended to speak.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.220
NASA’s official transcript of the quote
still shows the “a” in parentheses, “That’s

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.370
one small step for [a] man, one giant leap
for mankind.”

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.370
This is because the “a” is not audible
in the broadcast.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:25.010
For years, both NASA and Armstrong insisted
that static had obscured the “a”.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.610
Armstrong himself stated that he would never
make such a mistake (omitting such an important

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.950
part) but after listening to recordings of
his quote, finally conceded that it’s possible

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.850
that he may not have said the “a”.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.470
When he admitted this, he stated, “I would
hope that history would grant me leeway for

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.270
dropping the syllable and understand that
it was certainly intended, even if it was

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.280
not said—although it might actually have
been”.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.650
An Australia-based computer programmer named
Pater Shann Ford conducted a digital audio

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:00.080
analysis to support Armstrong’s claim that
he did say “a” and concluded that he did,

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.120
in fact, say “a man”, but the “a”
was inaudible due to technological limitations

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.120
of the time.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.000
However, linguists David Beaver and Mark Liberman
wrote their own digital audio analysis of

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.170
the infamous quote on Language Log blog and
concluded that, “The acoustic evidence seems

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.810
to be against Ford’s theory.”

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.640
But that’s not the end of the story.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.280
Support for Armstrong has been found in a
team of researchers from Michigan State University

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.860
and Ohio State University who have concluded
that Armstrong did indeed speak the words

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.420
he claims to have spoken but static or technological
limitations are not to blame for its apparent

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.420
omission.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.550
According to them, Armstrong’s Ohion accent
is to blame y’all.

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.270
According to a Michigan State University specialist
in communicative sciences, assistant professor

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.170
Laura Diller, because of the dialect of his
hometown, if Neil Armstrong did voice the

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.020
word “a”, it was short and fully acoustically
blended with the preceding word “for”.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.980
The Acoustical Society of America’s article
on this topic states that,

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.770
Dilley and her colleagues, who include MSU
linguist Melissa Baese-Berk and OSU psychologist

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.120
Mark Pitt, thought they might be able to figure
out what Armstrong said with a statistical

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.910
analysis of the duration of the ‘r’ sound
as spoken by native central Ohioans saying

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.280
‘for’ and ‘for a’ in natural conversation.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.690
They used a collection of recordings of conversational
speech from 40 people raised in Columbus,

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.900
Ohio, near Armstrong’s native town of Wapakoneta.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.470
Within this body of recordings, they found
191 cases of ‘for a’.

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.060
They matched each of these to an instance
of ‘for’ as said by the same speaker and

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.190
compared the relative duration.

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.069
They also examined the duration of Armstrong’s
‘for (a’) from the lunar transmission.

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:45.720
The researchers found a large overlap between
the relative duration of the ‘r’ sound

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.300
in ‘for’ and ‘for a’ using the Ohio
speech data.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:55.620
The duration of the ‘frrr(uh)’ in Armstrong’s
recording was 0.127 seconds, which falls into

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.320
the middle of this overlap, though it is a
slightly better match for an ‘a’-less

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.320
‘for’.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.650
In other words, the researchers conclude,
the lunar landing quote is highly compatible

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.129
with either possible interpretation, though
it is probably slightly more likely to be

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:13.220
perceived as ‘for’ regardless of what
Armstrong actually said.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.130
Dilley says there may have been a ‘perfect
storm of conditions’ for the word ‘a’

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:32.479
to have been spoken but not heard.
