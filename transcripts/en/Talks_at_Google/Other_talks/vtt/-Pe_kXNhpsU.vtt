00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.790
&gt;&gt; Well, thank you very much everybody for
being here.

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.330
I don't think our special guest today needs
much of an introduction.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.129
But I hope most of you, all of you know, Cherie
Blair.

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.579
Cherie's a barrister and a part-time judge
whose focus is public law

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:24.140
and human rights.
She practices in many UK courts as well as

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.650
the European Court of
Justice.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.060
Mother of four.
Very passionate about women's rights issues,

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.109
women's inequality,
religious freedom.

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:40.719
A whole bunch of other stuff.
And also is the wife of our prior Prime Minister

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:45.809
for ten years -- Prime
Minister for ten years, not wife for ten years.

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.940
CHERIE BLAIR: No, wife 29 years on Sunday.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.109
&gt;&gt; 29 on Sunday.

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:54.410
CHERIE BLAIR: This last Sunday. We just had
our 29th anniversary.

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:55.410
&gt;&gt; Congratulations.
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.219
CHERIE BLAIR: How many years have you been
married?

00:00:58.219 --> 00:00:59.219
&gt;&gt;18.

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.260
CHERIE BLAIR: 18. Not bad.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.980
&gt;&gt; That's not bad.
I'll never catch up though.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.019
You'll always be 20 years ahead.

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.070
CHERIE BLAIR: That's just cause I'm older
than you.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.109
Not perhaps as much as --
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:14.509
&gt;&gt; We won't go there.
She also has a First Class degree of London

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:19.520
School of Economics, which I found very fascinating.
But more importantly, she's recently written

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.240
a book called Speaking for
Myself, which was published in May 2008.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.540
And the paperback version comes out soon.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:27.909
CHERIE BLAIR: In June.

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:30.060
&gt;&gt; In June.
And a Chinese version comes out --

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.499
CHERIE BLAIR: Also in the summer.

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:32.499
&gt;&gt; Fantastic.
Wonderful.

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:37.070
And has been on the bestseller list many different
places, I noticed.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.399
So I was telling Cherie earlier, I've read
17 -- I've never done this

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:42.399
before.

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:43.399
CHERIE BLAIR: Haven't you?

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:46.829
&gt;&gt; You've done this at least -- I saw four
videos on YouTube, where

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.820
you've done it.
So at least you've done it four times.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.540
I know you've done it a lot more times.
So we're going to talk about the book we're

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.390
going to talk about issues
that Cherie is passionate about.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.650
And she's promised to talk about technology
because she's a

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:07.530
self-proclaimed geek, so she says.
So why don't we start with your book, if that's

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.530
good.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.930
CHERIE BLAIR: Well, actually, funny enough,
When I came in here, I didn't know I was going

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.440
to be talking about the
book on a beach.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.519
And I see all of you certainly as though you're
on a beach.

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.859
I'm, on the other hand, seem to be in a bit
more in the sort of more

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:23.859
business --

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:25.109
&gt;&gt; I think that we would be a lot more comfortable
for us to use.

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:29.299
CHERIE BLAIR: Funny enough, the book -- I
wanted to write a book which

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:46.630
actually you might like to read on a beach.
There was a lot of publicity at the time about

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:55.880
my book and what it was
going to be about.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:02.510
And it was going to be some sort of political
diatribe.

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:25.380
That was never what I wanted to do.
And that's not what the book's about.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:41.209
It's actually a woman's book.
It's a story of a woman who's in her 50s.

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:52.959
Who in a 50-year journey has come on a journey
which isn't unique.

00:03:52.959 --> 00:04:06.890
Though in the end, she ended up at 10 Downing
Street, which is

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:14.570
obviously more unusual than many others.
But the journey that I made over those 50

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:23.800
years reflects a journey that
so many women have made in the developed world

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:33.310
over the 50 years.
And I talk a little bit about my mother and

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:41.790
my grandmother both of whom
who left school at 14.

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:51.730
Both of whom who were intelligent women who
had a lot to offer but

00:04:51.730 --> 00:05:05.680
didn't get the opportunities that I was offered.
And both of whom who were absolutely determined

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:13.590
that I should be able,
and my sister should be able, to take advantage

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:21.930
of those opportunities.
And I'm very conscious that that's not an

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:27.180
untypical story, though it
has atypical elements.

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:35.720
And that's what I wanted to tell.
And I wanted to see that if a girl like me

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:46.030
coming from working class
Liverpool can get to the White House and to

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:50.120
meet the Pope, and all the
other things I've done --

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:59.030
That any girl or any boy actually, given the
right education and the

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:12.251
right opportunities, can go wherever they
want to go.

00:06:12.251 --> 00:06:25.610
&gt;&gt; So another book describes a journey.
And a lot of people here in this room, some

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:30.950
of the best and brightest,
are in the early stages of their journey of

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:35.390
life.
What can you give as advice to all these people

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:41.340
in terms of what are
some of the things that they should remember

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:46.340
as they undertake this
journey which you can draw upon from your

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:47.970
book or your life?

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:55.050
CHERIE BLAIR: Well, I think first off, never
be too planned.

00:06:55.050 --> 00:07:01.590
I think you always need to make allowances
for the unexpected.

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:12.090
I'm a great believer in seizing opportunities
as they along and also trying things.

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:20.610
Now, that's got me into trouble, by the way.
Because sometimes having an open mind and

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:35.580
trying to try things can get you into trouble.
But on the other hand, the curiosity about

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:48.550
the world, and what it has
to offer, I think, is something is that gets

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:55.210
me up every morning even
now.

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:59.280
&gt;&gt; What else would you say to these people
aspiring to --

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:06.890
CHERIE BLAIR: Well, these people, of course,
you were telling me

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:14.940
there're all already high achievers.
They've already had opportunities which other

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:25.190
people can only dream of.
And the reason they're here, I think, is because

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:37.370
they actually want to
think of ways to make the sort of opportunities

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:42.969
they've had available
to everyone else.

00:08:42.969 --> 00:08:49.950
Which is why I said to you I'd love to talk
about technology.

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:58.740
Because I think technology is really a key
to what we can deliver in

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:05.210
the 21st Century, which you could've only
dreamed about in centuries

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:12.180
beforehand.
That's not to say that there are some disadvantages

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:16.480
with technology but
it's also a huge opportunity.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:22.390
&gt;&gt; So let's go to technology and we'll come
back -- we'll keep going

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:27.240
back and forth depending on what you want
to talk about.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:30.430
You've Googled yourself, I presume?
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:34.850
We all have.
It's okay.

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:37.510
We're amongst friends.

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:48.390
CHERIE BLAIR: No, no.
Of course I've Googled myself but it's a little

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:59.380
bit sort of uninformative, really, because
all you get, you get the

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:10.020
whole of the stuff from the Daily Mail, you
know, frankly.

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:16.800
[LAUGHTER]
You don't want to go there.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:25.470
And certainly not if you're me, do you want
to go there.

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:31.850
And so, yes, of course.
I use Google all the time to find things.

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:38.580
But also, of course, conscious that sometimes
you find things on Google

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:44.899
that aren't true not at least if you read
the Daily Mail.

00:10:44.899 --> 00:10:48.330
&gt;&gt; That's true.
Well, you know, we just try and help people

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:50.940
find information.
We can't validate the information.

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:52.619
CHERIE BLAIR: You can't validate the information.

00:10:52.619 --> 00:10:55.980
&gt;&gt; We were talking earlier upstairs about
Facebook --

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:57.420
CHERIE BLAIR: Yep.

00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:06.790
&gt;&gt; And you said that's a bit of dangerous
place for you to go, given

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:13.910
how many people would be interested to finding
out what you do and

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:17.100
where you are.
But your kids are on Facebook?

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:20.510
CHERIE BLAIR: Well, my kids are on Facebook
but from time to time

00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:23.861
they've had to come off Facebook.
Because the problem that they've found is

00:11:23.861 --> 00:11:33.050
that -- they get put --
You go into Facebook, and it's like it's your

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:41.051
environment.
And that's certainly what they think.

00:11:41.051 --> 00:11:57.310
But the truth is it's also an environment
that the press can get into.

00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:09.709
And so there have times when we then find
that pictures that my

00:12:09.709 --> 00:12:20.700
daughter may have put onto Facebook have then
been taken by the papers

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:38.560
and published.
And what she might have wanted to share with

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:51.020
her community in Facebook
particularly in an era what she thought she

00:12:51.020 --> 00:13:00.680
was in a private space, she
doesn't actually want published to her parents,

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:05.360
frankly.
Not the least to the Daily Mail.

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:11.899
And so, it is a problem, I think, that if
you're involved in public

00:13:11.899 --> 00:13:19.350
life or if you're a child of someone involved
in public life -- even

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:27.260
when you're a private person yourself -- that
doesn't mean that other

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:33.040
people don't think that you're a non-private
person.

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:44.350
&gt;&gt; But do you think that things can stay private
on the Internet at

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:52.870
all?
Some of the kids who are there on Facebook

00:13:52.870 --> 00:14:01.390
could end up in public life
five years from now.

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:10.040
CHERIE BLAIR: Well, I think, it's strange,
isn't it? Because I think

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:19.850
that people when you use Facebook, when you
use the Internet, do think

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:21.839
it's private.
I think.

00:14:21.839 --> 00:14:31.810
I mean, they may be wrong about that.
But that's what kind of makes it you're having

00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:36.070
a conversation, you're
relaxed.

00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:48.850
And yes, you think you're sharing it with
your -- whoever it is.

00:14:48.850 --> 00:15:00.770
You were talking about communities self-selecting
so you think you're

00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:07.540
sharing it with a community of like-minded
people.

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:22.190
But, of course, there's always the opportunity
for you to be sharing it

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:35.200
with people actually you don't want to be
sharing it with.

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:49.370
So that's one the challenges of technology
as well as one of the

00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:54.010
opportunities.
It brings all sort of different people together,

00:15:54.010 --> 00:16:01.300
but it also raises
issues about what are the consequences of

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:05.980
that.
It's not least me talking about me putting

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:10.420
up a POSIEDON,
again, wanting to do that.

00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:17.630
But being very conscious, of course, because
I want to have -- I want

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:27.980
to help women get in contact with other women.
I always remember I was doing a speech in

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:33.519
Russia, and I often do Power
Point presentations of my speeches.

00:16:33.519 --> 00:16:44.779
And I wanted some pictures of Russian women.
So I went into Google and I put in "Russian

00:16:44.779 --> 00:16:46.140
women."
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:46.140 --> 00:17:02.670
And at the time I was -- at the time, I was
still in Number 10.

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:10.089
And suddenly these, I thought, this is not
what I was thinking.

00:17:10.089 --> 00:17:14.239
This is not the sort of Russian women I was
thinking of.

00:17:14.239 --> 00:17:19.949
And I also thought at any moment now the Downing
Street sort of --

00:17:19.949 --> 00:17:20.949
&gt;&gt; Security people.

00:17:20.949 --> 00:17:24.339
CHERIE BLAIR: Security people are going to
come rushing in here and

00:17:24.339 --> 00:17:29.279
seize the computer, and have me disciplined
for bad behavior.

00:17:29.279 --> 00:17:36.350
Obviously, you have to be pretty careful,
don't you?

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:42.429
&gt;&gt; So I was having the same conversation with
somebody who has a

00:17:42.429 --> 00:18:02.850
17-year old about being on Facebook.
And he was try to go tell her daughter that

00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:15.900
be careful whatever you put
up there could show up in the public life

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:26.950
at some point in time.
And she took her dad for the a walk and explained

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:31.960
that, Dad, this is a
generational gap thing.

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:41.971
That mostly likely the person who is going
be interviewing me is also going to be on

00:18:41.971 --> 00:18:50.190
Facebook.
So what do you think, just old people like

00:18:50.190 --> 00:19:01.220
you and me who are worried
about this information and the new generation

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:08.600
really is going to be
different?

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:18.629
CHERIE BLAIR: Well, I think it goes back to
what I said.

00:19:18.629 --> 00:19:22.850
I think that they're perfectly happy.
Because she'd be perfectly happy for the person

00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:30.620
who is interviewing her
is presumably her age, and is someone -- because

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:33.210
they're in that
community.

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:44.029
But would she be so happy --
I know your daughter is a bit young for this

00:19:44.029 --> 00:19:50.379
yet --
but would this 17-year old girl be so happy

00:19:50.379 --> 00:20:00.559
if in fact what
they were saying on Facebook was actually

00:20:00.559 --> 00:20:09.489
on her father's newspaper the
next day with banner headlines saying, you

00:20:09.489 --> 00:20:20.370
know, business executive's
daughter or whatever.

00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:23.740
And that, that's the question.

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:26.880
&gt;&gt; That's probably not a good idea.

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:41.820
CHERIE BLAIR: So I don't think that's about
old and young.

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:48.989
I think it's about not always appreciating
the pitfalls.

00:20:48.989 --> 00:21:01.059
&gt;&gt; So you talked about, you know, your kids
having to be taken off

00:21:01.059 --> 00:21:07.500
Facebook and your being on Facebook not being
a good idea.

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:12.419
CHERIE BLAIR: No, no. You're persuading me
that I should --

00:21:12.419 --> 00:21:15.480
YouTube, maybe.

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:21.279
&gt;&gt; I think YouTube.
I think you should definitely have a channel

00:21:21.279 --> 00:21:27.100
on YouTube.
What do you guys think?

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:34.860
I think she needs to have a channel on YouTube.
We'll talk about that after.

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:45.789
CHERIE BLAIR: As I told you, I'm always liking
to try things.

00:21:45.789 --> 00:21:57.479
And it's always getting me into trouble.
So when I get into trouble, I'm going to call

00:21:57.479 --> 00:22:01.219
you and blame you.

00:22:01.219 --> 00:22:14.440
&gt;&gt; We're trying to find her a camera slightly
smaller than that that

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:30.850
she can take with her when she goes -- so
we'll get you on a YouTube

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:36.890
channel.
But you touched upon something which is the

00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:46.529
notion of public life,
and having your kids having to grow up in

00:22:46.529 --> 00:22:55.249
the media spotlight.
And pretty much you having spent a lot of

00:22:55.249 --> 00:22:58.369
your life now in the media
spotlight.

00:22:58.369 --> 00:23:05.419
How does that impact life and how is that
different?

00:23:05.419 --> 00:23:14.960
CHERIE BLAIR: Well, I think one of the things
I wanted to do again in

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:20.159
the book was to try and give -- my husband's
going to write --

00:23:20.159 --> 00:23:34.470
he's writing a book and it will come out soon
and in fact will be all about

00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:35.909
the politics --

00:23:35.909 --> 00:23:43.619
&gt;&gt; Which one is going to be better?

00:23:43.619 --> 00:23:50.659
CHERIE BLAIR: Well, it depends what you're
looking for.

00:23:50.659 --> 00:24:04.619
I mean, he's not going to talk about some
of the things that I talked

00:24:04.619 --> 00:24:14.299
about.
And indeed when he read the book I think he

00:24:14.299 --> 00:24:24.519
skipped over quite a few
of the things overwhelmed with embarrassment.

00:24:24.519 --> 00:24:35.039
But I wanted to try and convey something about
what it is like to live

00:24:35.039 --> 00:24:49.820
or to try and live a private life in very
public circumstances.

00:24:49.820 --> 00:25:02.859
And yet in some ways, it's a bit of the story
of my life.

00:25:02.859 --> 00:25:12.409
Because when I was a girl, my father was very
famous for his time.

00:25:12.409 --> 00:25:23.759
He was an actor and he was very fortunate
that he became the sort of

00:25:23.759 --> 00:25:34.700
young interest in what was one of the very
first comedy soap operas in

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:43.099
Britain in 1960s called "Till Death Do Us
Part."

00:25:43.099 --> 00:25:49.529
And my father literally played himself, really,
was the SCASGET

00:25:49.529 --> 00:25:55.570
scarsgot son-in-law of Warren Mitchell who
was the working class

00:25:55.570 --> 00:26:00.399
racist, East End, opinionated person in the
family.

00:26:00.399 --> 00:26:09.039
And this was very much cutting edge at the
time.

00:26:09.039 --> 00:26:20.799
And so I suddenly found myself at school being
the child of somebody

00:26:20.799 --> 00:26:32.239
very famous.
Then of course I ended up married to somebody

00:26:32.239 --> 00:26:40.080
very famous.
And I still think as I said before, look,

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:49.850
one day I'll probably be the
mother of somebody very, very famous.

00:26:49.850 --> 00:27:00.450
And so it's an interesting question about
how public life and private

00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:07.539
life coincide.
And when we went into Number 10, my first

00:27:07.539 --> 00:27:19.259
priority was to ensure that
my kids, whatever else I did, was that I preserved

00:27:19.259 --> 00:27:22.739
a private space for
my children.

00:27:22.739 --> 00:27:39.799
And a lot of the time we were in Number 10,
it was quite a struggle to

00:27:39.799 --> 00:27:46.479
try and make that happen.
Because the other thing I wanted to do --

00:27:46.479 --> 00:27:55.799
and because my father was famous, but my father
abandoned my mother and my sister and I with

00:27:55.799 --> 00:28:05.809
his mother in Liverpool and went off to pursue
his career in London.

00:28:05.809 --> 00:28:19.330
So though he was famous, he wasn't at home.
And so I was always at one stake removed.

00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:29.830
I was also very concerned that my children
should feel that whatever

00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:38.929
happened when we were in Number 10 wasn't
something that was being

00:28:38.929 --> 00:28:53.340
imposed on them that they were very much a
part of it.

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:57.239
And it was a bit of tension there, really,
between making sure that

00:28:57.239 --> 00:29:05.539
your family is involved and feel involved.
And at the same time protecting them from

00:29:05.539 --> 00:29:18.809
the press who say, well, if
you allow your child to be photographed at

00:29:18.809 --> 00:29:29.489
all, it means that we can
then follow them around and do anything we

00:29:29.489 --> 00:29:38.679
like.
Now, as a lawyer, I happen to know that that's

00:29:38.679 --> 00:29:42.429
not how privacy law
works.

00:29:42.429 --> 00:29:49.919
But sometimes there's obviously always a constant
tension between the

00:29:49.919 --> 00:29:58.429
press who always want more, and the personal
who always wants to

00:29:58.429 --> 00:30:00.480
preserve a private space.

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:05.129
&gt;&gt; What do you think about the UK media?

00:30:05.129 --> 00:30:09.789
CHERIE BLAIR: Oh, I love them.

00:30:09.789 --> 00:30:16.399
&gt;&gt; We are on camera, so.

00:30:16.399 --> 00:30:28.039
CHERIE BLAIR: What you have to understand
is that, you know, a free

00:30:28.039 --> 00:30:33.350
media is a really, really important part of
democracy.

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:41.289
I totally and utterly accept that.
But I think there's a difference between the

00:30:41.289 --> 00:30:44.749
public interest as we
would define it --

00:30:44.749 --> 00:30:52.370
which is things that the public are legitimately
interested and entitled to know about --

00:30:52.370 --> 00:31:03.440
and things that the public might be interested
in which may, of course, and in fact we know,

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:15.820
of course, is often stuff which is more about
gossip and celebrity and lifestyle.

00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:29.039
Which wouldn't necessarily be embraced by
the noble cause of ensuring

00:31:29.039 --> 00:31:42.299
democracy functions well.
But because you have a challenging and connected

00:31:42.299 --> 00:31:43.480
media.

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:52.139
&gt;&gt; So let's go back and try to bridge media
and technology.

00:31:52.139 --> 00:31:59.330
Because all of us here constantly face this
conversation with media

00:31:59.330 --> 00:32:06.269
given that things are more on the Internet,
and there's a lot of

00:32:06.269 --> 00:32:10.220
conversation about newspapers being in trouble?

00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:20.869
CHERIE BLAIR: Well, it's true.
And you know, as a politician, you have to

00:32:20.869 --> 00:32:29.359
engage with the media.
Because democracy is all about the people

00:32:29.359 --> 00:32:33.220
holding their elected
officials accountable.

00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:41.090
And therefore, they need to know what their
elected officials are

00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:44.129
doing.
And the elected officials who have a program

00:32:44.129 --> 00:32:48.019
for government, also want
to actually explain what's going on.

00:32:48.019 --> 00:32:57.289
And that's why the media is very, very important.
On the other hand, if it gets hijacked into

00:32:57.289 --> 00:33:04.349
trivia which is why the
problem that I sometimes encountered, you

00:33:04.349 --> 00:33:12.100
know.
When you government had a serious issue, if

00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:21.879
all that was being talked
about was Cherie's latest gaffe, then actually

00:33:21.879 --> 00:33:34.779
I was damaging something
that I cared very deeply about which was that

00:33:34.779 --> 00:33:44.429
the New Labor Government would be a success
and would deliver.

00:33:44.429 --> 00:33:50.899
And so you know so you're constantly in danger
of being sidetracked in

00:33:50.899 --> 00:33:51.899
your mission.
Now, the newspapers.

00:33:51.899 --> 00:34:00.359
Are we going to need newspapers?
I'm sure we're going to need -- we were just

00:34:00.359 --> 00:34:13.130
talking before, you have
all this information on the Internet.

00:34:13.130 --> 00:34:26.040
And you do need some sort of way of filtering
that information.

00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:31.620
And that's basically what journalists have
done through the centuries

00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:44.310
is help filter the information.
So content, journalistic content, I think

00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:52.700
is very important.
How it's delivered on the other hand, it's

00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:56.521
like a different question,
isn't it?

00:34:56.521 --> 00:35:06.910
Because though I still get my newspaper and
like to read it,

00:35:06.910 --> 00:35:17.510
particularly when I'm traveling, actually,
I will probably go on to the

00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:27.461
Internet and get that information.
I know my kids, of course, get so much of

00:35:27.461 --> 00:35:28.590
their information through the
new media.

00:35:28.590 --> 00:35:37.370
And that's -- that's definitely a generational
thing.

00:35:37.370 --> 00:35:40.980
And a real challenge for the more traditional
media.

00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:42.810
&gt;&gt; So shifting to another Google service,
you mentioned that you've

00:35:42.810 --> 00:35:44.490
looked up your house on Google Street, have
you not?

00:35:44.490 --> 00:35:46.190
CHERIE BLAIR: I have indeed.

00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:52.390
&gt;&gt; But one of your houses is not on Google
Earth and the other one is?

00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:59.530
CHERIE BLAIR: Well, we have a little place
in the country.

00:35:59.530 --> 00:36:07.230
And that's kind of, I think because it's in
the country, you know.

00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:12.670
As far as I gather, your coverage doesn't
cover everything yet.

00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:18.250
But obviously our house in London is very
much on the Google.

00:36:18.250 --> 00:36:19.280
It's very, actually, I was looking for something
 --

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:25.790
&gt;&gt; It's a nice, sunny, bright day when they're
taking the picture.

00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:41.460
CHERIE BLAIR: Yes, it's a rather nice -- it's
a rather nice picture.

00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:52.150
You go on to the Google Maps, you get your
directions, and then you now

00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:55.370
click on that little button, and you actually
 --

00:36:55.370 --> 00:36:56.370
&gt;&gt; Fantastic.

00:36:56.370 --> 00:36:58.680
CHERIE BLAIR: I was fascinated.

00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:08.020
&gt;&gt; One of the things we talked about was this
balance that one has to

00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:17.920
strike between the role of technology and
privacy for an individual.

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:31.830
Since you're a lawyer you talk about human
rights and you talk about

00:37:31.830 --> 00:37:37.670
these things.
How do you think we strike that balance right?

00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:40.400
And what should we be thinking about?

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:44.840
CHERIE BLAIR: Well, you know, I think that
there's never a hundred

00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:56.120
percent right answer about this.
And the more you talk about human rights you

00:37:56.120 --> 00:38:01.890
have to understand, it's
always about balance.

00:38:01.890 --> 00:38:18.220
There are very few absolutes in human rights.
In fact, even the right to life for a long

00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:22.950
time was qualified by
capital punishment.

00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:32.000
Now in Europe now we don't do that qualification
anymore.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:40.540
And you can't be a member of the Counsel of
Europe if you have the

00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:43.670
death penalty.
But the fact was even that most fundamental

00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:47.150
right to life did have a
proviso.

00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:52.940
Also torture and slavery are some of the absolute
rights.

00:38:52.940 --> 00:39:03.060
But when you start talk about privacy, the
right to family life, when

00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:10.500
you talk about the rights of association,
free speech --

00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:25.370
all of them come with the requirement that
you can only do that so long as you don't

00:39:25.370 --> 00:39:32.230
interfere with the rights and freedoms of
others.

00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:44.660
And all of them actually come with this notion
of responsibility.

00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:51.250
And you know you can't -- human rights are
much more nuanced than that.

00:39:51.250 --> 00:39:57.170
And then of course, there isn't a hierarchy
of rights.

00:39:57.170 --> 00:40:03.200
So your right to disseminate information comes
up against my right to

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:06.110
privacy.
And that's about trying to strike a balance.

00:40:06.110 --> 00:40:13.030
And generally speaking, the rule is what you
do is you do the least

00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:20.830
intrusive way of restricting freedom.
Which is commensurate with giving rights and

00:40:20.830 --> 00:40:24.640
freedoms to others.
And is that involves government's trying to

00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:32.300
strike a balance.
It involves individuals and companies trying

00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:36.880
to strike a balance.
And in the end, if the balance, if they can't

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:41.160
agree on where the
balance is, it involves the courts adjudicating

00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:46.030
as to where the balance
should be struck.

00:40:46.030 --> 00:41:02.740
The advantage, I would say this as a lawyer,
about having it decided in

00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:16.211
the courts is that you do in the court, of
course, have a debate and

00:41:16.211 --> 00:41:29.690
the two sides of the argument are put.
And in the end, the judge has to reach a conclusion

00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:35.070
and when he reaches
that conclusion, he gives you his --

00:41:35.070 --> 00:41:41.050
Why do I say he?
She gives you her reasons.

00:41:41.050 --> 00:41:55.540
And so you have a reasoned judgment, and if
you don't like it you can

00:41:55.540 --> 00:42:08.500
then appeal.
So as someone who believes in the rule of

00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:21.080
law I think that's a good
structure for trying to reach this balance.

00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:25.340
But everybody has a part to play.

00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:29.940
&gt;&gt; We were talking earlier about DNA information,
for example.

00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:48.550
And how if we had access to a lot of DNA information
from around the

00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:55.580
world there's a possibility you could do a
lot to help?

00:42:55.580 --> 00:43:00.490
CHERIE BLAIR: It's definitely, very much so.

00:43:00.490 --> 00:43:09.500
&gt;&gt; And the risk now if you collect everybody's
DNA information that

00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:14.080
intrusion of the people's privacy --

00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:23.210
CHERIE BLAIR: Well, actually, I think that
if it was happening to

00:43:23.210 --> 00:43:30.660
everybody, if everybody had their DNA collected,
then everybody would

00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:37.790
then be in the same boat.
I think the concern has been, and of course

00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:43.270
there's been a recent case
about that, because that it wasn't happening

00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:52.860
to everybody but it was
only happening to certain people.

00:43:52.860 --> 00:44:08.110
And they were people who were in a bit, one
way or another, come into

00:44:08.110 --> 00:44:23.840
connection with the police.
And it was agreed, and doing this balancing

00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:30.840
act that if someone is
actually committed in a crime and has been

00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:39.620
convicted, then clearly that
is right that their DNA should be collected

00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:46.940
and kept.
The question is, however, if they are not

00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:55.160
charged with a crime or if they're acquitted
then what happens?

00:44:55.160 --> 00:45:05.440
And the Europe Court has decided that across
Europe there are

00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:08.830
restrictions on that.
And had an unrestricted access, and they decided

00:45:08.830 --> 00:45:16.890
that they felt that
that wasn't the right balance.

00:45:16.890 --> 00:45:32.310
But actually, I mean I think there could be
a case for everybody

00:45:32.310 --> 00:45:42.920
contributing their DNA because we do know
that the bigger the --

00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:49.660
You know, we had a bigger DNA database than
many other places in Europe

00:45:49.660 --> 00:46:03.680
and because of that, we have been able to
identify people who have

00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:10.140
committed serious crimes.
And it doesn't seem like a day doesn't go

00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:19.070
past or certainly a week
doesn't go past when some DNA evidence has

00:46:19.070 --> 00:46:22.500
either solved the crime
today,

00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:27.480
or as we saw just recently has proved somebody
innocent years after the

00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:31.000
event.
So DNA is a very important tool.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:41.670
But it has to be the way you use that tool
has to be done so that there

00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:54.430
are checks and balances.
And so there's a balance between people's

00:46:54.430 --> 00:47:00.610
rights and the rights of the
community to protect itself.

00:47:00.610 --> 00:47:10.510
And you know this is a debate that is absolutely
right that we should

00:47:10.510 --> 00:47:11.510
have.

00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:16.290
&gt;&gt; This is a good thing we're taking pictures
of everybody's house,

00:47:16.290 --> 00:47:22.280
almost everybody.
So we're doing it to everybody is the same

00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:25.530
way, like --

00:47:25.530 --> 00:47:42.140
CHERIE BLAIR: You know in some ways if everybody's
in the same boat

00:47:42.140 --> 00:48:12.660
then you can see that that's a good argument.
I also because I sit as a judge and I see

00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:20.440
in cases in court,
we have quite often we have camera evidence,

00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:31.320
video camera evidence, and it seems to get
better all the time.

00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:37.210
And but -- often, of course, you find that
when it comes to the actual crucial moment

00:48:37.210 --> 00:48:41.810
that's just the bit you can't see.

00:48:41.810 --> 00:48:44.770
&gt;&gt; So let's change topics. You know you're
very passionate about

00:48:44.770 --> 00:48:50.570
equality issues.
And we were talking about Kenya, Rwanda, and

00:48:50.570 --> 00:49:01.560
other parts of the world.
Just give us a sense of all the things you

00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:18.610
see in that area.
What do you think are important things?

00:49:18.610 --> 00:49:24.080
You had a very interesting point about making
sure we are designing

00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:32.630
technology which is of a gender neutral --

00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:40.160
CHERIE BLAIR: Accessible to women, yes.

00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:45.761
&gt;&gt; So I would love to hear your thoughts on
that.

00:49:45.761 --> 00:49:52.350
CHERIE BLAIR: I mean basically it all comes
back to my life story.

00:49:52.350 --> 00:50:03.770
You know, I was a girl brought up by two strong
women who didn't have

00:50:03.770 --> 00:50:19.360
opportunities that I was given.
And you go across the world and you see so

00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:31.130
many wasted opportunities
because in so many cultures and in so many

00:50:31.130 --> 00:50:34.030
societies, women just aren't
valued in the same way as men.

00:50:34.030 --> 00:50:42.890
And we still have a world today where a girl
baby is born in India or

00:50:42.890 --> 00:50:50.890
in China -- or maybe not even born because
they know it's a girl baby

00:50:50.890 --> 00:51:03.030
and so it's aborted simply because of that.
Or is born but then infanticide happens.

00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:15.500
There are plenty of places around the world
where you have a baby, and

00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:42.890
it's a boy and it's a cause for celebration.
And you have a baby and it's a girl, and it's,

00:51:42.890 --> 00:51:50.630
you know, at best,
better luck next time.

00:51:50.630 --> 00:52:22.380
As long as we start from that position where
women are not valued the

00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:45.220
same as men, and we are not actually having
the world as it ought to be

00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:56.370
where women and men are of equal worth and
of equal value and come

00:52:56.370 --> 00:53:07.850
together and work as partners, which is much
more creative.

00:53:07.850 --> 00:53:22.660
I can see here you've got men and women.
And the reality is it's much more creative

00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:26.500
when we use our
complementary skills.

00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:35.030
But, you know, it goes on.
You go to school.

00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:48.810
Girls -- 70 percent of the illiterate children
in the world are girls.

00:53:48.810 --> 00:53:52.830
Why is that?
Because when it comes to making choices about

00:53:52.830 --> 00:54:04.600
which child you educate,
boys are more likely to be educated than girls.

00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:24.320
And yet we know that if you do educate a girl
child you have, she's

00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:31.540
more likely to have fewer children.
She's more likely to marry later.

00:54:31.540 --> 00:54:37.550
She's more likely to make sure her children
are inoculated.

00:54:37.550 --> 00:54:50.420
She's more likely to educate her own children.
So you couldn't have a better investment but

00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:57.580
many, many countries,
we're failing there.

00:54:57.580 --> 00:55:02.100
And then you go on, girls get married too
young.

00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:05.340
Therefore they lose out on education.
Or the women here will know even if not in

00:55:05.340 --> 00:55:13.800
this company,
we could talk about that, but even if it's

00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:14.800
not in this company, in other companies they've
been, you know --

00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:15.800
We find that girls leave university now probably
doing better at

00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:16.800
university than men, that within three years
of women graduating they

00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:17.800
already earn 15 percent less than the equivalent
male graduate.

00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:18.800
Why is that?
We could talk about that.

00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:23.750
And I could go on.
So I think the women's issues.

00:55:23.750 --> 00:55:34.180
You know in the 21st Century, the 21st century
is not the century where

00:55:34.180 --> 00:55:43.910
women become equally respected of equal value
with men then we will

00:55:43.910 --> 00:55:54.190
have failed and that's my passion.
We need to make sure those opportunities are

00:55:54.190 --> 00:56:02.420
there.
So then I think what can I do to do with that?

00:56:02.420 --> 00:56:14.770
I've touched on education being a key.
But lots of things are going on about education

00:56:14.770 --> 00:56:19.970
at the moment, really
good work.

00:56:19.970 --> 00:56:25.500
But the thing that struck me about my own
story in comparison is that

00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:37.420
it was the fact that I was able to be economically
independent, to get

00:56:37.420 --> 00:56:45.960
and to keep any own money and make my own
choices about that, that made

00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:52.090
a big difference.
And so I'm very interested in how we give

00:56:52.090 --> 00:56:55.720
this economic independence to
women.

00:56:55.720 --> 00:57:04.860
And what I want to try and do, is to help
women entrepreneurs, just

00:57:04.860 --> 00:57:12.270
help them link up with other women and grow
their businesses.

00:57:12.270 --> 00:57:21.060
Now by that I don't mean microfinance.
I'm sure everyone in this room knows microfinance

00:57:21.060 --> 00:57:23.470
is a fantastic
success story.

00:57:23.470 --> 00:57:27.869
Not designed originally for women.
Now very much about women.

00:57:27.869 --> 00:57:32.540
But it's still about helping mothers educate,
it's still about keeping

00:57:32.540 --> 00:57:33.990
women within the confines that society has
put to her.

00:57:33.990 --> 00:57:34.990
It's very, very hard.
Not all of those women will be entrepreneurs,

00:57:34.990 --> 00:57:35.990
but it's very hard for
those women who come up through microfinance

00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:36.990
who are entrepreneurs to
gain access to the next stage of growing their

00:57:36.990 --> 00:57:37.990
business.
So I'm concentrating on helping with training

00:57:37.990 --> 00:57:38.990
programs and mentoring
and networking advice for that grade of women

00:57:38.990 --> 00:57:39.990
who can then break out of
their homes and become drivers of development

00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:41.030
in their country.
And for that, I'm sure there's a lot we can

00:57:41.030 --> 00:57:45.020
do in reality.

00:57:45.020 --> 00:57:55.220
&gt;&gt; Let's focus on Africa.
Because as you mentioned earlier, there's

00:57:55.220 --> 00:58:00.360
a lot of stuff that Google is
doing in Africa and wants to do in Africa

00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:05.960
on the infrastructure side.
And you've touched along upon Rwanda and the

00:58:05.960 --> 00:58:06.960
situation there.

00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:16.480
CHERIE BLAIR: Well, I telling you -- would
you like me to tell the

00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:17.480
story?

00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:18.790
&gt;&gt;Yeah, please.

00:58:18.790 --> 00:58:28.960
CHERIE BLAIR: In fact, I describe in the book.
Because I go to, and I went first with Laura

00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:29.960
Bush, just after the
G8 Summit.

00:58:29.960 --> 00:58:32.920
I've been fascinated about Rwanda for a long
time because, of course,

00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:35.590
Rwanda had the genocide.
And it also had an international tribunal

00:58:35.590 --> 00:58:39.320
that dealt with the crimes
against humanity there.

00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:56.490
And as a lawyer, I was very interested in
how as a legal system do you

00:58:56.490 --> 00:59:05.580
cope when society collapses to such an extent
that people who were

00:59:05.580 --> 00:59:12.410
neighbors start doing the most unspeakably
horrible things to each

00:59:12.410 --> 00:59:17.480
other.
So I went to Rwanda and then I went a second

00:59:17.480 --> 00:59:22.700
time.
And my second time they took me up to a village

00:59:22.700 --> 00:59:29.530
in the north of the
country which had been ravaged by the genocide

00:59:29.530 --> 00:59:30.530
and been sort of left
for dead.

00:59:30.530 --> 00:59:34.260
And an American entrepreneurs had come and
helped them set up a

00:59:34.260 --> 00:59:35.260
cooperative.
And they were doing fair trade coffee.

00:59:35.260 --> 00:59:36.260
And in fact, their coffee was being sold in
Sainsbury's here.

00:59:36.260 --> 00:59:39.330
And the women were very much involved in that
project.

00:59:39.330 --> 00:59:41.240
In particular, they trained the women to do
 -- I didn't realize this

00:59:41.240 --> 00:59:42.400
but, you know, like you do wine tasting?
You do the same thing with coffee beans.

00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:43.400
In fact they tried -- I tried to do it but
I was hopeless because you

00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:44.400
have to swill it around your mouth and spit
it out.

00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:45.400
I couldn't get my head around it.
But these women were fantastic.

00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:46.400
But they were some of the best testers and
graders of coffee.

00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:47.400
And I was talking to them, and they were telling
me about how they were

00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:48.400
using the Internet to contact their suppliers.
Because then they would know what the price

00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:49.400
of coffee was going to be
and they could also deal with queries and

00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:50.400
requests.
And they took me to their office where they

00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:51.400
had a computer and they
were doing all this on Skype.

00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:53.441
Here I am in the middle of nowhere in Rwanda,
and here they were

00:59:53.441 --> 00:59:54.441
communicating with Sainsbury's in London and
people in America using

00:59:54.441 --> 00:59:55.441
Skype.
And when they weren't using the computer for

00:59:55.441 --> 00:59:56.441
their business, the women
made it available to the school in the village

00:59:56.441 --> 00:59:57.441
so the kids could use it
for their projects.

00:59:57.441 --> 00:59:58.441
And I thought, you know, isn't this amazing?
That could not have happened 10, 15 years

00:59:58.441 --> 00:59:59.441
ago.
But it just shows the power of technology.

00:59:59.441 --> 01:00:00.441
But one of the things I've subsequently learned,
however, is that

01:00:00.441 --> 01:00:01.441
technology in Africa is becoming available
but it's very man-centered.

01:00:01.441 --> 01:00:02.441
The people who were going in there when they
talk about, you know, you

01:00:02.441 --> 01:00:03.441
can use this for banking.
You can use this for insurance.

01:00:03.441 --> 01:00:04.441
You can use this for communicating with your
markets.

01:00:04.441 --> 01:00:05.441
In their heads, they see a man doing all those
things.

01:00:05.441 --> 01:00:06.441
And if you talk, if they talk about and think
about women using it at

01:00:06.441 --> 01:00:07.441
all,
what they'll say is, oh well, for the women,

01:00:07.441 --> 01:00:08.441
of course, it means
that they can speak to their mother or their

01:00:08.441 --> 01:00:09.441
friends,
you know, more often during the day.

01:00:09.441 --> 01:00:10.441
And so you, it's really important that if
we're talking about access to

01:00:10.441 --> 01:00:11.441
technology in Africa, that we make it so that
it isn't gender centric.

01:00:11.441 --> 01:00:12.441
That it isn't masculine.
That it's actually seen as something that's

01:00:12.441 --> 01:00:13.441
available to women as well
as men.

01:00:13.441 --> 01:00:14.441
Otherwise, we'll have the same problem that
you have about women

01:00:14.441 --> 01:00:15.441
getting access to finance.
The same problem for women having access to

01:00:15.441 --> 01:00:16.441
technology which is a
really important tool to develop your business.

01:00:16.441 --> 01:00:17.441
&gt;&gt; So in that context, another thing which
is I think very common

01:00:17.441 --> 01:00:18.441
amongst the people here, not only they're
all smart and they work for

01:00:18.441 --> 01:00:19.441
Google, is all of them I think I speak for
all of them --

01:00:19.441 --> 01:00:20.441
that they have a passion for trying to change
the world.

01:00:20.441 --> 01:00:21.441
CHERIE BLAIR: Well, me too.

01:00:21.441 --> 01:00:22.441
&gt;&gt; And the question is what advice can you
give them in terms of them

01:00:22.441 --> 01:00:23.441
individually making a contribution towards
changing the world?

01:00:23.441 --> 01:00:24.441
CHERIE BLAIR: Well, I absolutely think it
does start with the

01:00:24.441 --> 01:00:25.441
individual.
I think there's lots of things we can do more

01:00:25.441 --> 01:00:26.441
generally.
But in the end it's about you and your view

01:00:26.441 --> 01:00:27.441
of the world and your
belief in yourself.

01:00:27.441 --> 01:00:28.441
And the fact that you can make a difference.
And if we can teach our children, if we bring

01:00:28.441 --> 01:00:29.441
everybody up to see that
actually each one of us can make a difference.

01:00:29.441 --> 01:00:33.280
And we can do that in all sorts of ways even
in simple things like

01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:34.280
buying the Rwandan coffee.
I've just been involved in a campaign about

01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:35.280
trafficking women and
children across the world.

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:37.000
And Cadbury's have just announced that from
this summer their Cadbury's

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.619
Dairy Milk is going to be a fair trade product.
Because I don't know if you know, but actually,

01:00:40.619 --> 01:00:41.720
there's a big problem
in West Africa

01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:47.940
where a lot of the cocoa beans come from with
children and others being trafficked into

01:00:47.940 --> 01:00:49.220
there.
Not for sex but as workers in collecting the

01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:50.220
cocoa for which they don't
get paid.

01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:51.220
They're just trapped there.
And there are now ways of ensuring that you

01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:52.220
only buy cocoa beans from
places where that's not happening.

01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:53.290
So taking decisions like that about your Easter
eggs that some of you

01:00:53.290 --> 01:00:54.290
may be thinking of buying would be something
you can do.

01:00:54.290 --> 01:00:55.290
But with the skills and knowledge in this
room, there is so much you

01:00:55.290 --> 01:00:56.290
can do.
So much you can do nationally.

01:00:56.290 --> 01:00:57.290
And I'm sure you probably have schemes already
where you link up with

01:00:57.290 --> 01:00:58.290
schools and you do mentoring and help there.
And then, of course, internationally just

01:00:58.290 --> 01:00:59.290
with what you're saying.
I know you're thinking about Africa at the

01:00:59.290 --> 01:01:00.290
moment so think about some
of these things.

01:01:00.290 --> 01:01:02.860
Think about the women in Africa as well as
the men.

01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:03.860
Think about how much they have to offer.

01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:05.880
&gt;&gt; So in that line, you know, you have all
this energy and all this

01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:06.880
passion.
Where do you draw your inspiration from?

01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:07.880
CHERIE BLAIR: From a number of things.
I think at the end, it does go back to my

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:08.880
mother and my grandmother.
And seeing them struggle when my father left,

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:09.880
my mother who had been --
she'd been accepted at RADA.

01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:10.880
And so she'd gone to the Royal Academy of
Dramatic Art in the 50s and

01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:12.130
then she'd -- she'd gone in her vacation.
She got the vacation job and that's how she

01:01:12.130 --> 01:01:14.580
met my father.
He was the juvenile lead male, and she was

01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:15.580
juvenile female lead.
And the next thing you know she's pregnant

01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:16.580
with me.
And then several years on, her husband leaves

01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:17.580
her, and she actually goes and works in a
fish and chips shop.

01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:18.580
In the docks in Seaforth to --
It was the only job she could find where she

01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:19.580
could be able to be there
for us during the day, and still work at night.

01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:20.580
And you think the come down from thinking
you're going to be, you know,

01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:21.580
a glamorous actress to working in a fish and
chips shop in the docks of

01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:22.580
Liverpool.
And yet, she then, you know, pulled herself

01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:23.580
up, got herself a better
job.

01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:24.580
Educated two daughters, both of whom qualified
as lawyers, and ended up

01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:25.580
as the mother-in-law of the Prime Minister.
She's had an incredible life.

01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:26.580
&gt;&gt; So one of the things which we all struggle
with which we find as we

01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:27.580
talk to people is since everybody's ambitious,
and really has

01:01:27.580 --> 01:01:28.580
tremendous amounts of energy and passion in
this room,

01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:29.580
we often struggle with striking the right
balance between work and life.

01:01:29.580 --> 01:01:30.580
And you're a mother of four, you have a professional
career, you have a

01:01:30.580 --> 01:01:31.580
very public life,
as well as you were married to an individual

01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:32.580
who also has a very public life.
And how do you balance all these things so

01:01:32.580 --> 01:01:33.580
that you can maintain your
relationships and -- keep the personal part

01:01:33.580 --> 01:01:34.580
happy?

01:01:34.580 --> 01:01:35.580
CHERIE BLAIR: I would say do as I say but
not necessarily as I do.

01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:36.580
Because that's what I'm going to Malta tomorrow
to talk at a breakfast

01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:37.580
meeting there with the wife of the Prime Minister
of Malta precisely

01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:38.580
about these work/life issues.
And I wish I had the magic formula because

01:01:38.580 --> 01:01:39.580
if I had, wouldn't I be a
wealthy woman?

01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:40.580
But one thing I'm sure of is that this is
not just about women.

01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:41.580
This is absolutely about men and women together.
And if we see this -- if we see work/life

01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:42.580
balance issues as simply a
woman's issue,

01:01:42.580 --> 01:01:43.580
we are completely missing the point.
Because if it's wrong to think of women as

01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:44.580
simply only being able to
offer things within the confines of the home,

01:01:44.580 --> 01:01:45.580
it's equally wrong to think the men actually
are only there to be the breadwinners and

01:01:45.580 --> 01:01:46.580
that they don't care about their family life.
That they don't have a lot to offer.

01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:47.580
It's very important, for example, that our
boys and our girls see

01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:48.580
images of men, you know, of good men,
of active fathers who are contributing not

01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:49.580
just in the work force but in their family
life.

01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:50.580
And, of course, work/life balance isn't just
about bringing up

01:01:50.580 --> 01:01:51.580
children.
It's about what you do about your elderly

01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:52.580
parents.
Something that's becoming more of life issue

01:01:52.580 --> 01:01:53.580
for me as --
and for many people.

01:01:53.580 --> 01:01:54.580
And it's also about just doing the things
that you're passionate about.

01:01:54.580 --> 01:01:55.580
I mean one of the problems I find is just
finding some time when

01:01:55.580 --> 01:01:56.580
actually you're doing something for yourself.
And many of you in this room might sometimes

01:01:56.580 --> 01:01:57.580
find that,
particularly some of you who are parents,

01:01:57.580 --> 01:01:58.580
that you know by the time you've --
One young woman lawyer said to me that you

01:01:58.580 --> 01:01:59.580
know if only my -- the
partners in this firm could understand the

01:01:59.580 --> 01:02:00.580
amount, sheer amount of
effort that I've put into getting all my kids

01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:01.580
out and everything sorted
out before I come into work,

01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:02.580
they would never doubt the commitment that
I had to my work.

01:02:02.580 --> 01:02:03.580
But in the midst of that sometimes you can
lose out on actually making

01:02:03.580 --> 01:02:04.580
sure that you're still a person who's got
needs and rounded

01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:05.580
experiences.
See, it's a really difficult question.

01:02:05.580 --> 01:02:06.580
But it's not just about crushes at work.
That helps.

01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:07.580
It's not just about making sure you have flexi-work.
And it's certainly in my tea company, I presume

01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:08.580
it goes without saying.
I couldn't have done my career.

01:02:08.580 --> 01:02:09.580
I couldn't have carried on as a lawyer if
it wasn't for the fact that I

01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:10.580
was able to use the Internet and the intranet
from 10 Downing Street.

01:02:10.580 --> 01:02:11.580
So I could actually carry on researching my
cases without having to

01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:12.580
actually physically go into the office.
But it's not only about that.

01:02:12.580 --> 01:02:13.580
It's also about an attitude of mind.
It's about accepting that people sometimes

01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:14.580
may want to come into the
workforce.

01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:15.580
So it may well be in your twenties you work
very, very hard.

01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:16.580
But maybe in your sort of childbearing years,
you might want to take a

01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:17.580
to work a bit more flexibly.
But if you do that, it's really important

01:02:17.580 --> 01:02:18.580
that there's a way of getting
back into the workforce.

01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:19.580
It's very important you keep connections,
that you keep your training

01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:20.580
going.
And I myself when I was a young barrister,

01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:21.580
in those days there wasn't
-- we didn't have a maternity policy,

01:02:21.580 --> 01:02:22.580
and I thought at the time, I was so determined
at being the first woman in my chambers --

01:02:22.580 --> 01:02:23.580
I was so determined to show that I could have
children, and still you

01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:24.580
know, still be a good barrister.
And looking back on it now, I think that maybe

01:02:24.580 --> 01:02:25.580
I thought I was changing
the system, and maybe I was just playing to

01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:26.580
the system.

01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:27.580
&gt;&gt; No doubt, yes.

01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:28.580
CHERIE BLAIR: Because I wasn't -- there was
no concession made for the

01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:29.580
fact you're pregnant.
And actually, we need to make some concessions.

01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:30.580
Society needs to make concessions for the
fact of pregnant women need

01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:31.580
to, you know, be essentially protected so
that their babies flourish.

01:02:31.580 --> 01:02:32.580
I mean eventually, with my first son they
actually confined me to the

01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:33.580
hospital bed.
You know, ten days before he was -- well,

01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:34.580
actually, I think a month
before he was due because he wasn't growing

01:02:34.580 --> 01:02:35.580
enough.
Now, in fact, it turned out afterwards that

01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:36.580
all my babies were small, so actually it probably
was the right thing for me.

01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:37.580
But it was kind of -- I was so busy doing
all these things and maybe I

01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:38.580
wasn't looking after myself well enough.
You don't, you shouldn't put women in that

01:02:38.580 --> 01:02:39.580
position.

01:02:39.580 --> 01:02:40.580
&gt;&gt; So I want to ask people to think of questions
and ask questions

01:02:40.580 --> 01:02:41.580
which are on their mind.
But before I do that, you can't come to Google

01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:42.580
and not answer the
questions we ask every new Googlers.

01:02:42.580 --> 01:02:43.580
So you're going to have to help me.
So should we start with the first concert?

01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:44.580
CHERIE BLAIR: My first concert?

01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:45.580
&gt;&gt; Yes.

01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:46.580
CHERIE BLAIR: You mean that I performed in
or that I attended?

01:02:46.580 --> 01:02:47.580
[LAUGHTER]

01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:48.580
&gt;&gt; Both.
I know Tony used to sing in a band.

01:02:48.580 --> 01:02:49.580
CHERIE BLAIR: Oh absolutely.
But I also -- in the 60s it was a big thing

01:02:49.580 --> 01:02:50.580
about folk music.
And Joni Mitchell and Joan Baez.

01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:51.580
I met Joan Baez recently.
I nearly died.

01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:52.580
You know, I said, oh god, I used to sing your
songs.

01:02:52.580 --> 01:02:53.580
I used to play a guitar and sing.
I thought well but probably very, very badly.

01:02:53.580 --> 01:02:54.580
So that's for sure.
So that was the first --

01:02:54.580 --> 01:02:55.580
&gt;&gt; Concert that you performed in.

01:02:55.580 --> 01:02:56.580
CHERIE BLAIR: That I performed in.
And my first concert that I attended?

01:02:56.580 --> 01:02:57.580
That's quite difficult.
I remember going quite early on to see Elton

01:02:57.580 --> 01:02:58.580
John perform.
Later on, of course, he was at that first

01:02:58.580 --> 01:02:59.580
time event at the White
House, and we had, we had with the Clintons.

01:02:59.580 --> 01:03:00.580
And we had a State Visit.
And they put on a fantastic concert that Elton

01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:01.580
John played in and
Stevie Wonder sang My Cherie Amour for me.

01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:02.580
Pretty good.
One of the highlights.

01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:03.580
&gt;&gt; What the other questions that we ask Googlers?
Before you -- go ahead Leanne.

01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:04.580
What are the other Googlers questions?
First date?

01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:05.580
CHERIE BLAIR: First date?

01:03:05.580 --> 01:03:06.580
&gt;&gt; You want to answer that?

01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:07.580
CHERIE BLAIR: Yeah.
Random fact.

01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:08.580
Well, I'll do first date.

01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:09.580
&gt;&gt; Do the first date.
I have already seen you talk about your boyfriends

01:03:09.580 --> 01:03:10.580
in your interview
with the Dominic in the University of California.

01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:11.580
So I think it's out in the public domain.

01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:12.580
CHERIE BLAIR: Well, yes, it was more than
one.

01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:13.580
I had -- surprisingly my husband doesn't like
to me to talk about it.

01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:14.580
There were a few more boyfriends before him.
That's true.

01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:15.580
But actually the -- the first date or the
first time I was kissed was

01:03:15.580 --> 01:03:16.580
when I was about seven.
And --

01:03:16.580 --> 01:03:17.580
&gt;&gt; Okay.
I don't think you're setting the right role

01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:18.580
model here.
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:18.580 --> 01:03:19.580
CHERIE BLAIR: With A boy whose, whose father
actually became --

01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:20.580
Well, he has was the choirmaster at the school.
Because I was singing in the choir.

01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:21.580
And it was under the -- in those days we still
had steam trains

01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:22.580
traveling between Liverpool and Southport,
and that -- it was under one

01:03:22.580 --> 01:03:23.580
of the bridges that went over the train.
And then my sister ran back and told my mom

01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:24.580
about it.
Very embarrassing, cause years later having

01:03:24.580 --> 01:03:25.580
told this story, the Daily
Mail, of course, go and tracked down this

01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:26.580
ruddy chap.
No, no.

01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:27.580
This very nice chap who now runs a pub in
 -- somewhere in England.

01:03:27.580 --> 01:03:28.580
And he was insisted that we were not seven
and that we were older than

01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:29.580
that, but I am sure --

01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:30.580
&gt;&gt; He insists he was legal age.

01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:31.580
CHERIE BLAIR: No, no.
I think he insisted that we were about 9 or

01:03:31.580 --> 01:03:32.580
10, but he was wrong.

01:03:32.580 --> 01:03:33.580
&gt;&gt; Okay, well.
On that, do you have a question?

01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:34.580
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
Well, it's cheeky because it's two questions.

01:03:34.580 --> 01:03:35.580
Firstly, why did you join the Labor Party?
And secondly why didn't you ever stand for

01:03:35.580 --> 01:03:36.580
Parliament?

01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:37.580
CHERIE BLAIR: Well, I did stand for Parliament.

01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:38.580
&gt;&gt; So I stand corrected.

01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:39.580
CHERIE BLAIR: I joined the Labor Party because,
well partly, it's kind

01:03:39.580 --> 01:03:40.580
of -- I came from a working class family,
and we always voted Labor.

01:03:40.580 --> 01:03:41.580
And when I was --
When I was 16 they had a teacher at school

01:03:41.580 --> 01:03:42.580
Mrs. Spate, who actually
cause I was at a convent school, but she was

01:03:42.580 --> 01:03:43.580
a quaker.
And she was a member of the Labor Party,

01:03:43.580 --> 01:03:44.580
and she invited me along to meetings.
And years later, she contacted me when I was

01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:45.580
in Number 10.
And subsequent she's -- she died.

01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:46.580
And you know, I still keep in contact with
her daughter who every year

01:03:46.580 --> 01:03:47.580
sends me a little note.
So she was the first person who -- and I joined

01:03:47.580 --> 01:03:48.580
the Labor Party because
I believe in social justice, in equality,

01:03:48.580 --> 01:03:49.580
and its mission to make people like me have
the opportunities that I've been able to have.

01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:50.580
If it hadn't had been for the Labor government
coming in this 1945 and

01:03:50.580 --> 01:03:51.580
changing the system, you know,
a girl like me wouldn't have even got the

01:03:51.580 --> 01:03:52.580
opportunity to go to school.
I was so fortunate because I had a full grant

01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:53.580
to go to university.
Which was -- which was a fantastic opportunity.

01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:54.580
You know, so I think I need to to give something
back.

01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:55.580
And part of the way of giving something back
was to support the Labor

01:03:55.580 --> 01:03:56.580
Party.
And I did stand for Parliament.

01:03:56.580 --> 01:03:57.580
And in 1983, I stood in Thanet North, which
was a seat which is

01:03:57.580 --> 01:03:58.580
basically around Margate and Herne Bay -- which
even in '97 didn't

01:03:58.580 --> 01:03:59.580
become a Labor seat.
So it was never a surefire winner, that's

01:03:59.580 --> 01:04:00.580
for sure.
But there was a brief period when Tony was

01:04:00.580 --> 01:04:01.580
the candidate's spouse.
And this was not a happy period for him.

01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:02.580
[LAUGHTER]
And I tell the story in the book of how just

01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:03.580
in Easter, just before the
May election, or it was June, actually.

01:04:03.580 --> 01:04:04.580
We'd been on holiday, and we came back from
holiday in France into

01:04:04.580 --> 01:04:05.580
Dover.
We went to see my agent to talk about the

01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:06.580
forthcoming election and so
we had lunch.

01:04:06.580 --> 01:04:07.580
And at the end of lunch he said to Tony,
Tony would you mind but Cherie and I need

01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:08.580
to talk a bit about the campaign and business,
so would you mind going out and helping my

01:04:08.580 --> 01:04:09.580
wife wash up?
[LAUGHTER]

01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:10.580
And so he went and helped his wife wash up.
And as he was drying the pots, she said, Tony

01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:11.580
are you interested in politics at all or is
it just that you're doing this to support

01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:12.580
Cherie?
I think that point he was about to divorce

01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:13.580
me.
And I think what Hillary Clinton shows is

01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:14.580
that it's not easy, actually, to be spouse
of a leader.

01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:15.580
And I think she showed that she as a fantastic
First Lady.

01:04:15.580 --> 01:04:16.580
And also had the potential to be a fantastic
President, and now

01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:17.580
fantastic Secretary of State.
But I think Bill, possibly, who was a great

01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:18.580
leader could have done with
a little bit more help about being a support,

01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:19.580
you know, running that
First Lady role.

01:04:19.580 --> 01:04:20.580
It's more difficult than you think.

01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:21.580
&gt;&gt; I think you need to stand up.
[INAUDIBLE]

01:04:21.580 --> 01:04:22.580
&gt;&gt; -- get your views specifically, on recent
calls about cutting

01:04:22.580 --> 01:04:23.580
maternity leave from nine months to six months
to allow partners more

01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:24.580
time off for that to be with their newborn.

01:04:24.580 --> 01:04:25.580
CHERIE BLAIR: Well, I actually think this
is a really interesting idea

01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:26.580
and one which illustrates something I do feel
passionately about.

01:04:26.580 --> 01:04:27.580
Which is, we should be talking about parenting
in the 21st Century.

01:04:27.580 --> 01:04:28.580
And we should not be assuming that this is
all about women.

01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:29.580
And in fact I think sometimes as women we
need to be careful.

01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:30.580
You can often find that you go to the school
gate, you know, if you go

01:04:30.580 --> 01:04:31.580
as a mother, that's fine.
You know, but a father going to the school

01:04:31.580 --> 01:04:32.580
gate, you know,
and half the mothers are whether wondering

01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:33.580
whether he's a child molester.
You know, we need to start being more comfortable

01:04:33.580 --> 01:04:34.580
about the idea that,
you know, men too have a lot to offer in a

01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:35.580
caring role.
And that's a challenge for women.

01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:36.580
Because in a sense I suppose for a long time
we've been placed in this

01:04:36.580 --> 01:04:37.580
area, and now it's about sharing this area.
Having -- having said that, I think I also

01:04:37.580 --> 01:04:38.580
have said that we obviously
need to be do something to support a woman

01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:39.580
when she goes through
essentially what is a physical process, pregnancy,

01:04:39.580 --> 01:04:40.580
and you do need to
make allowances for that.

01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:41.580
Because otherwise, you know, you can endanger
both the mother and the

01:04:41.580 --> 01:04:42.580
child.
So there needs to be a balance there.

01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:43.580
But shared parenting, shared responsibility
is the way ahead.

01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:44.580
And actually I was very lucky.
The ironic thing is that if Tony and I had

01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:45.580
both been barristers,
because he was doing more commercial law,

01:04:45.580 --> 01:04:46.580
and I was doing more of the employment law,
which doesn't get paid as much.

01:04:46.580 --> 01:04:47.580
If I'd fallen pregnant and he was still a
lawyer, it may well have been

01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:48.580
that it would have been actually harder for
me to continue with my

01:04:48.580 --> 01:04:49.580
work.
But the fact was that as I was fighting that

01:04:49.580 --> 01:04:50.580
election in 1983, he went
off and got the Sedgefield seat which was

01:04:50.580 --> 01:04:51.580
a safe seat.
And I discovered I didn't -- I thought I was

01:04:51.580 --> 01:04:52.580
just in distress,
but it turned out that I was actually pregnant

01:04:52.580 --> 01:04:53.580
with my first child at that point.
But because Tony then had become an MP, I

01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:54.580
also found myself then being
the main breadwinner.

01:04:54.580 --> 01:04:55.580
And so to that extent, there was a financial
incentive for me to carry

01:04:55.580 --> 01:04:56.580
on working.
And Tony because he was an opposition MP,

01:04:56.580 --> 01:04:57.580
and therefore wasn't in
government, had actually slightly more time

01:04:57.580 --> 01:04:58.580
to be a hands-on father.
And he was -- you know, he always jokes and

01:04:58.580 --> 01:04:59.580
unkindly shares with many
people that I'm, once I get to sleep at night,

01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:00.580
you kind of have to
dynamite me out of bed.

01:05:00.580 --> 01:05:01.580
And so often at nighttime, when the children
were crying it would be

01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:02.580
Tony who would get up and then he'd bring
the baby to me.

01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:03.580
And you know I would then feed, feed the baby.
And you know he was, he was definitely changing

01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:04.580
nappies long before it
was fashionable.

01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:05.580
Of course, it became more difficult when Leo
came along because he was

01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:06.580
suddenly Prime Minister.
And you know I was wanting to persuade him

01:05:06.580 --> 01:05:07.580
to take a paternity leave.
And of course Leo did very well because he

01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:08.580
was actually born early on a
Friday at a week which actually was a Parliamentary

01:05:08.580 --> 01:05:09.580
recess week.
And so there was no -- there was no question

01:05:09.580 --> 01:05:10.580
time.
And so Tony was able --

01:05:10.580 --> 01:05:11.580
He didn't take -- obviously he kept taking
phone calls.

01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:12.580
And he worked on his boxes but he did base
himself up in the flat for

01:05:12.580 --> 01:05:13.580
that week.
And the fact was as soon as Leo was born,

01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:14.580
he wanted to be there.
As those of you who are fathers will know

01:05:14.580 --> 01:05:15.580
that feeling, I'm sure.
And those of you who will become fathers will

01:05:15.580 --> 01:05:16.580
experience it, too.
You want to be able to share in this new life

01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:17.580
which the two of you have
created together.

01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:18.580
That's really important.

01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:19.580
[INAUDIBLE QUESTION]
[PAUSE]

01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:20.580
CHERIE BLAIR: Well, I think there's -- there
are two points there.

01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:21.580
One is the issue of corruption, and what in
the speak we call

01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:22.580
"governance issues."
And it's actually something that Tony feels

01:05:22.580 --> 01:05:23.580
very passionately
about as well.

01:05:23.580 --> 01:05:24.580
And in fact, he has, as part of his work that
he's doing now, a

01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:25.580
charity.
And at the moment they're working both in

01:05:25.580 --> 01:05:26.580
Rwanda and in Sierra Leone.
And their main purpose is trying to help with

01:05:26.580 --> 01:05:27.580
setting up and supporting
a proper system of governance.

01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:28.580
Which is particularly helping in both cases
to run the Office of the

01:05:28.580 --> 01:05:29.580
President and Prime Minister
in the countries in a way which is transparent,

01:05:29.580 --> 01:05:30.580
which is open, corruption-free, and efficient.
Efficient actually is really quite important,

01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:31.580
as you can imagine.
I, myself, am interested in how we can use

01:05:31.580 --> 01:05:32.580
the law to help with that.
Because in many of these countries like Rwanda,

01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:33.580
for example, after the
genocides,

01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:34.580
there were only about 15 laws in the entire
country.

01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:35.580
I mean, that's a real challenge to try and
build up a legal system from

01:05:35.580 --> 01:05:36.580
scratch.
And other thing I'm convinced of is that once

01:05:36.580 --> 01:05:37.580
you get corruption in the
system, it's very, very damaging.

01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:38.580
And it's, it's a very precious thing a corrupt-free
bureaucracy, a

01:05:38.580 --> 01:05:39.580
corrupt-free judiciary.
And once you have that undermined, it takes

01:05:39.580 --> 01:05:40.580
a long time to right.
So it's a really, it's a really important

01:05:40.580 --> 01:05:41.580
issue.
And it's quite complicated and difficult subject

01:05:41.580 --> 01:05:42.580
to tackle.
As for what we do about development, well,

01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:43.580
I think one thing we've
certainly learned --

01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:44.580
And if you listen to someone like Muhammad
Yunus, he will tell you this

01:05:44.580 --> 01:05:45.580
as well, that handouts are not as good as
hand ups.

01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:46.580
Imposing things on people without consulting
them doesn't work.

01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:47.580
So if you're going to go in, what you must
do is you must consult the

01:05:47.580 --> 01:05:48.580
local community.
You must make sure the local community have

01:05:48.580 --> 01:05:49.580
a sense of ownership in it.
If possible, involve the local community in

01:05:49.580 --> 01:05:50.580
the --
If you're talking about digging a well, or

01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:51.580
laying a road, you know, so
that the jobs actually go to the local people.

01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:52.580
It's also about even at a higher level, when
you're going in, lots of

01:05:52.580 --> 01:05:53.580
countries have lots of consultants.
It's really important that the consultants

01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:54.580
actually transfer the
knowledge, and leave it in the country.

01:05:54.580 --> 01:05:55.580
Rather than having the knowledge, going in,
doing a project, and then

01:05:55.580 --> 01:05:56.580
taking the knowledge out again.
So it's all about capacity building.

01:05:56.580 --> 01:05:57.580
It's all about helping people, whether it's
a government or actually

01:05:57.580 --> 01:05:58.580
individuals, help themselves because there's
a dignity in that.

01:05:58.580 --> 01:05:59.580
And there's a learning experience in that
which, sometimes aid projects haven't always

01:05:59.580 --> 01:06:00.580
encouraged.
[PAUSE]

01:06:00.580 --> 01:06:01.580
&gt;&gt; Thanks. We touched on Street View earlier.
And as you know, some parties in this country

01:06:01.580 --> 01:06:02.580
have reacted quite
strongly against Street View even going so

01:06:02.580 --> 01:06:03.580
far as to ask for it to be
shut down.

01:06:03.580 --> 01:06:04.580
And some have pointed out the irony that we
live in a country where the

01:06:04.580 --> 01:06:05.580
public accepts, with little protest,
a government who collects vast amounts of

01:06:05.580 --> 01:06:06.580
data.
Recently talking about tracking social networks

01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:07.580
and e-mails and text
messages in the name of national security.

01:06:07.580 --> 01:06:08.580
What are your views on that?
Should we be more worried about the government,

01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:09.580
less worried freeing
information to the public?

01:06:09.580 --> 01:06:10.580
CHERIE BLAIR: Well, I think it's what I said
before about the whole

01:06:10.580 --> 01:06:11.580
question about privacy and rights to information.
It's about getting the balance right.

01:06:11.580 --> 01:06:12.580
And, you know, when you have any of these
issues I think you have to

01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:13.580
say well what -- what are we collecting this
information for?

01:06:13.580 --> 01:06:14.580
Is it for a good purpose?
Cause if it isn't, then we shouldn't be doing

01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:15.580
it anyway.
That's the first thing.

01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:16.580
But let's assume therefore that there is a
legitimate purpose in that.

01:06:16.580 --> 01:06:17.580
Are we then --
So the next question then is are we doing

01:06:17.580 --> 01:06:18.580
in it the least intrusive
way?

01:06:18.580 --> 01:06:19.580
And that may involve, for example, as I gather
you now do, allowing

01:06:19.580 --> 01:06:20.580
people if they do object, to opt out.
Or it may involve actually saying you have

01:06:20.580 --> 01:06:21.580
to have people opt in.
I mean, these are these are the questions

01:06:21.580 --> 01:06:22.580
that need to be debated.
Lawyers love the concept of proportionality.

01:06:22.580 --> 01:06:23.580
Is it proportional?
So it's that idea you don't use the sledge

01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:24.580
hammer to crack a nut.
And actually, it's all about a scale and a

01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:25.580
balance.
And it's about bringing the -- the balance

01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:26.580
to the right tipping point.
And that may change over time.

01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:27.580
And it's about debating.
It's about being transparent in what you're

01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:28.580
doing.
And it's about making sure that you can justify

01:06:28.580 --> 01:06:29.580
what you're doing as
actually benefitting people, cause if you

01:06:29.580 --> 01:06:30.580
can't, then you shouldn't be
doing it.

01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:31.580
&gt;&gt; We prefer the idea of opt out as opposed
to opt in, because it

01:06:31.580 --> 01:06:32.580
becomes very onerous.
Hey, you know, I'm planning a building, you

01:06:32.580 --> 01:06:33.580
have a choice to object as opposed to --

01:06:33.580 --> 01:06:34.580
CHERIE BLAIR: But you would.
But there needs to be a discussion about whether

01:06:34.580 --> 01:06:35.580
 --
Because you have also a commercial imperative.

01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:36.580
And so you know, is your commercial imperative
furthering on or not

01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:37.580
furthering the public interest?
And the important thing is to debate that

01:06:37.580 --> 01:06:38.580
and to debate you it
openly.

01:06:38.580 --> 01:06:39.580
But I think the disadvantage is in somehow,
sometimes I don't like some

01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:40.580
of the things that are in the press is this
kind of scare mongering

01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:41.580
about things.
Because actually sharing information, having

01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:42.580
information available is a
very powerful tool for good as well as for

01:06:42.580 --> 01:06:43.580
bad.
And therefore we shouldn't, we shouldn't be

01:06:43.580 --> 01:06:44.580
silly about this.
But we have to make sure that the proper checks

01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:45.580
and balances is in
place.

01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:46.580
&gt;&gt; Hi, you and I are both Catholics, I believe.

01:06:46.580 --> 01:06:47.580
CHERIE BLAIR: Ah, yes.

01:06:47.580 --> 01:06:48.580
&gt;&gt; How does it make you feel when you see
Cardinal Ratzinger or Pope

01:06:48.580 --> 01:06:49.580
Benedict going to Africa, to many countries
which have double digit HIV

01:06:49.580 --> 01:06:50.580
infection rates, telling people not to use
condoms.

01:06:50.580 --> 01:06:51.580
And what do you think Catholics should actually
do about that?

01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:52.580
CHERIE BLAIR: I think it makes me rather sad.
And I think that there is a real question,

01:06:52.580 --> 01:06:53.580
and a real dividing line between contraception,
which I see as a way of preventing life beginning,

01:06:53.580 --> 01:06:54.580
and abortion, which is about terminating a
life that has begun.

01:06:54.580 --> 01:06:55.580
I think there is a distinction between the
two.

01:06:55.580 --> 01:06:56.580
And that sometimes the condom issue doesn't
add clarity to that

01:06:56.580 --> 01:06:57.580
distinction but rather makes it a lot more
muddy.

01:06:57.580 --> 01:06:58.580
My own view is, and I've said this before,
that condoms are absolutely

01:06:58.580 --> 01:06:59.580
essential in the fight against AIDS.
And that we should be encouraging people to

01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:00.580
use them.
But, we also must understand that promiscuity

01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:01.580
is a problem.
That actually sex is about relationships and

01:07:01.580 --> 01:07:02.580
respect.
And that, that if you have a culture which

01:07:02.580 --> 01:07:03.580
sees sex as just a
commodity, if we, that this is not necessarily

01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:04.580
 --
Well, this is not necessarily a bad thing,

01:07:04.580 --> 01:07:05.580
it is a bad thing.
And therefore, how we encourage people to

01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:06.580
behave responsibly,
and part of behaving responsibly to my mind

01:07:06.580 --> 01:07:07.580
anyway
particularly in a country where there is an

01:07:07.580 --> 01:07:08.580
endemic AIDS epidemic is to use safe sex methods.
But responsible sex is also really important.

01:07:08.580 --> 01:07:09.580
And the idea that anything goes --
And the Pope, of course, was talking about

01:07:09.580 --> 01:07:10.580
how promiscuity is a
problem.

01:07:10.580 --> 01:07:11.580
And it is a problem, and he's right to draw
attention to that.

01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:12.580
Again, we're talking about striking the right
balance, having a

01:07:12.580 --> 01:07:13.580
discussion.
And making sure that we don't throw the sort

01:07:13.580 --> 01:07:14.580
of dignity baby out with the bath water.
The dignity of individuals and the respect

01:07:14.580 --> 01:07:15.580
there should be between a
man and a woman in all relationships including

01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:16.580
sexual.
And actually for that matter, between same-sex

01:07:16.580 --> 01:07:17.580
partners.

01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:17.588
&gt;&gt; On that note, thank you very much.
