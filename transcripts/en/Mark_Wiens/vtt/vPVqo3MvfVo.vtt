00:00:00.325 --> 00:00:02.604
- In Rome we say
cheese like it rains.

00:00:02.604 --> 00:00:03.799
- [Mark] Okay.

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:07.801
Alright, I gotta begin with the carbonara.

00:00:07.801 --> 00:00:10.051
Twist a, twist a fork bite.

00:00:18.798 --> 00:00:20.103
Good morning everyone, it's Mark Wiens

00:00:20.103 --> 00:00:23.099
with migrationology.com, in Rome, Italy.

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:26.216
It is a nice, bright, sunshine morning,

00:00:26.216 --> 00:00:29.375
we have a full day of
sightseeing, and doing things

00:00:29.375 --> 00:00:32.102
and eating in Rome, so we're
gonna go have breakfast

00:00:32.102 --> 00:00:34.852
real fast, and then we're gonna head out.

00:00:34.852 --> 00:00:39.019
Ying and I are the first ones
to breakfast this morning.

00:00:40.454 --> 00:00:43.492
And we have a nice view
overlooking the city,

00:00:43.492 --> 00:00:46.078
we have a nice view and the park and so

00:00:46.078 --> 00:00:47.869
I just got my first plate of food, I have

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:50.573
just kind of a mish-mash
of many different things,

00:00:50.573 --> 00:00:53.354
of many different proteins, an omelette,

00:00:53.354 --> 00:00:55.929
some salmon, some salami,
some bacon, and then

00:00:55.929 --> 00:00:59.921
some vegetables, and
these are little, little

00:00:59.921 --> 00:01:02.004
pickled shallots I think.

00:01:06.198 --> 00:01:10.968
And this is some wonderful
looking bacon, check out

00:01:10.968 --> 00:01:12.801
the streakiness of it.

00:01:23.961 --> 00:01:25.591
We're getting ready to
leave in a few minutes for

00:01:25.591 --> 00:01:27.144
a full day of sightseeing
in Rome, but let me

00:01:27.144 --> 00:01:30.343
just quickly show you
on this map, sort of the

00:01:30.343 --> 00:01:33.877
rough plan, we are staying
up here near to Spagna,

00:01:33.877 --> 00:01:36.865
we're gonna take the
Metro down to Colosseo.

00:01:36.865 --> 00:01:39.139
We're gonna go to the
Colosseum, we're gonna go to the

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:43.391
Palatine Hill, and we're
gonna go to the Forum.

00:01:43.391 --> 00:01:46.746
We'll try to eat around
here, go to the Pantheon,

00:01:46.746 --> 00:01:50.231
go to some other sites around
here, walk around here,

00:01:50.231 --> 00:01:53.353
walk around here, and then
maybe go back down here

00:01:53.353 --> 00:01:57.602
to visit San Giovanni, we'll
see how our time comes.

00:01:57.602 --> 00:02:00.185
(upbeat music)

00:02:12.362 --> 00:02:16.428
We took the Metro from
Spagna to Colosseo Station,

00:02:16.428 --> 00:02:20.531
and immediately, right
at the exit of the Metro,

00:02:20.531 --> 00:02:23.531
we are at the base of the Colosseum.

00:02:26.846 --> 00:02:29.098
We are here a little bit
early, before they open,

00:02:29.098 --> 00:02:30.925
so we're just gonna walk
around for a little bit,

00:02:30.925 --> 00:02:34.166
and I have pre-bought the
ticket online and then

00:02:34.166 --> 00:02:36.179
printed it off, so I
hope we can just enter

00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:37.929
as soon as they open.

00:02:41.092 --> 00:02:42.721
It was really good actually
that we printed off

00:02:42.721 --> 00:02:45.515
our tickets because then
after we got through security

00:02:45.515 --> 00:02:48.103
we passed the whole line,
just scanned in, it has a

00:02:48.103 --> 00:02:51.951
little barcode, and we are
into the Colosseum now.

00:02:51.951 --> 00:02:54.009
We have decided to climb
the stairs to the top first

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:57.143
to get a view, an overall
view from the top.

00:02:57.143 --> 00:02:58.173
- [Ying] Look at the view.

00:02:58.173 --> 00:02:59.614
- [Mark] This an awesome view.

00:02:59.614 --> 00:03:01.482
- [Ying] Oh, you can see everything here.

00:03:01.482 --> 00:03:04.117
- [Mark] At one point
this Colosseum could hold

00:03:04.117 --> 00:03:06.654
up to 80 000 spectators.

00:03:06.654 --> 00:03:09.821
(upbeat techno music)

00:03:16.205 --> 00:03:18.886
And it was covered in a
flooring, so now you can see

00:03:18.886 --> 00:03:22.395
sort of some of the
underground area, but this is

00:03:22.395 --> 00:03:25.382
where the gladiators would
fight, and also this is

00:03:25.382 --> 00:03:27.790
where they would reenact
battles, and it could even

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.362
be flooded, so that they
could reenact naval battles

00:03:31.362 --> 00:03:32.981
and depictions as well.

00:03:32.981 --> 00:03:37.218
You have seen so many photos,
and you've seen movies

00:03:37.218 --> 00:03:40.476
that depict the Colosseum,
and so just imagining

00:03:40.476 --> 00:03:44.177
the battles and the
events, and the things that

00:03:44.177 --> 00:03:46.327
took place within the
Colosseum as you're walking

00:03:46.327 --> 00:03:48.390
through here, that's
what, that's what really

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.052
comes to mind when I'm walking through.

00:03:50.052 --> 00:03:53.052
We are on our way next to the Forum.

00:03:56.404 --> 00:03:58.331
Right across the plaza
from the Colosseum is the

00:03:58.331 --> 00:04:02.190
Roman forum, and this was
the heart, the very center,

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.081
of ancient Rome, and so
many of the most important

00:04:05.081 --> 00:04:09.248
buildings, and this is the
area where Rome thrived.

00:04:11.364 --> 00:04:14.114
(relaxed music)

00:04:16.626 --> 00:04:18.170
And I think one of the
things that's really

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:20.146
making it amazing to
visit right now is how

00:04:20.146 --> 00:04:22.229
quiet and peaceful it is.

00:04:25.437 --> 00:04:28.104
(relaxed music)

00:04:35.436 --> 00:04:38.203
Right behind me is what
remains of the Temple of Saturn

00:04:38.203 --> 00:04:41.120
which is one of the
oldest temples in Rome.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.227
It dates back to the sixth
century BC, but the remains

00:04:44.227 --> 00:04:48.310
of what you can see right
now date back to 42 BC.

00:04:49.795 --> 00:04:52.378
Oh, they have fresh cold water.

00:05:04.303 --> 00:05:06.858
It's just a short walk
from the central Forum area

00:05:06.858 --> 00:05:09.976
up to the top of Paletine
Hill, and from up here

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:13.564
there's the Imperial
Palace, you can get a view

00:05:13.564 --> 00:05:17.731
of the Forum, as well as Circus
Maximus on the other side.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.630
(relaxed music)

00:05:23.687 --> 00:05:26.531
And now I'm overlooking
Circus Maximus, which is

00:05:26.531 --> 00:05:30.932
a giant open-air horse
chariot racing stadium,

00:05:30.932 --> 00:05:34.113
and also they held public
events here, and it could

00:05:34.113 --> 00:05:38.387
accommodate up to 150 000
people that would watch events.

00:05:38.387 --> 00:05:40.602
You could easily spend a
couple of hours walking

00:05:40.602 --> 00:05:44.175
and exploring around the
Forum area, but it is now

00:05:44.175 --> 00:05:47.451
my favorite time of the
day, so we just exited.

00:05:47.451 --> 00:05:50.034
(upbeat music)

00:05:54.502 --> 00:05:56.119
- Hi guys.
- Hello.

00:05:56.119 --> 00:05:58.124
- Would you like to drink something?

00:05:58.124 --> 00:05:59.791
- Just water please.

00:06:00.967 --> 00:06:03.617
This is a restaurant
that serves, actually I'm

00:06:03.617 --> 00:06:05.485
a little bit overwhelmed
by the menu, there are

00:06:05.485 --> 00:06:07.631
so many things to order.

00:06:07.631 --> 00:06:09.448
Crepa?
- Crepa, one.

00:06:09.448 --> 00:06:11.781
- One, and also amatriciana?

00:06:14.725 --> 00:06:17.058
- Amatriciana.
- Amatriciana.

00:06:20.736 --> 00:06:24.081
In Italy, I really honestly
have very, very little

00:06:24.081 --> 00:06:26.755
experience with Italian
food, and even ordering

00:06:26.755 --> 00:06:29.547
Italian food, so I was looking
at that menu, there are

00:06:29.547 --> 00:06:32.949
so many things that I haven't
tried, I wanna try it all

00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:34.262
when I'm here in Italy.

00:06:34.262 --> 00:06:37.166
To begin with, I got a plate of antipasto,

00:06:37.166 --> 00:06:39.792
and this is, this is a mixture
of different vegetables

00:06:39.792 --> 00:06:42.617
which appear to be slightly
battered and deep fried,

00:06:42.617 --> 00:06:45.430
this is a red chili, there's
some eggplant, some onions,

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:48.046
maybe potatoes, I'll start
with piece of eggplant.

00:06:48.046 --> 00:06:49.466
Oh, and some olives in the middle.

00:06:49.466 --> 00:06:51.028
Set this onto my plate,
oh I gotta have some of

00:06:51.028 --> 00:06:54.611
that chili as well, or
some of that pepper.

00:06:57.971 --> 00:07:02.138
Mmmmm, it's a really soft,
like fully tender pepper.

00:07:03.849 --> 00:07:06.453
A little bit sweet, and sour.

00:07:06.453 --> 00:07:08.843
Maybe it's the tomato sauce,
or, there's some tomatoes

00:07:08.843 --> 00:07:12.426
on there that make it
really sour and tart.

00:07:15.852 --> 00:07:19.769
Yeah, that is equally as
creamy, that eggplant.

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:25.403
It's kind of like a, almost
tastes like breadcrumb crust,

00:07:25.403 --> 00:07:29.570
that's fried, and crispy, and
kind of almost gummy as well.

00:07:31.577 --> 00:07:33.941
Amatriciana?
- Amatriciana.

00:07:33.941 --> 00:07:35.608
- Amatriciana, okay.

00:07:41.229 --> 00:07:43.609
The main dishes have arrived,
and I got, we ordered,

00:07:43.609 --> 00:07:45.656
Ying and I ordered two
different dishes to split,

00:07:45.656 --> 00:07:49.480
this one is trippa, which
is tripe, and this is

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:54.171
I think a Roman style preparation,
very heavy tomato sauce,

00:07:54.171 --> 00:07:57.405
and then he sprinkled on
some cheese on top, and

00:07:57.405 --> 00:07:59.338
I think there's, I think
it's all, I don't think

00:07:59.338 --> 00:08:02.823
there's any pasta in here,
I think it's just all tripe.

00:08:02.823 --> 00:08:06.140
My kind of a dish, just sauce and tripe.

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:09.307
Okay, I'm just gonna taste this first.

00:08:11.736 --> 00:08:12.569
Mmmmm.

00:08:14.872 --> 00:08:18.289
That tripe is nice and soft, but it also,

00:08:19.346 --> 00:08:23.002
okay bits of it are a little
bit chewy, but it's wonderful.

00:08:23.002 --> 00:08:27.422
And then that's kind of
a, a little bit of a tart

00:08:27.422 --> 00:08:30.672
tomato sauce, but not too salty at all.

00:08:34.021 --> 00:08:35.219
That's awesome.

00:08:35.219 --> 00:08:37.484
And then this is a type
of pasta, this one is

00:08:37.484 --> 00:08:42.052
called amatriciana, and
this is a, also a very

00:08:42.052 --> 00:08:45.199
common pasta dish, tomato
based, and then I'm not sure

00:08:45.199 --> 00:08:47.354
if you can see, there
are little cubes of cured

00:08:47.354 --> 00:08:50.565
pork belly, and then
wrapped up in this pasta,

00:08:50.565 --> 00:08:52.982
and let me, let me stab some.

00:08:56.444 --> 00:08:57.277
Mmmmm.

00:08:59.946 --> 00:09:04.750
What I love about that is the
tomatoes are so sour and tart,

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:08.686
that is delicious, and that
little pork belly just gives it

00:09:08.686 --> 00:09:12.769
so much flavor along with
the tart tomato flavor.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:18.122
I think you gotta use
some of this bread to

00:09:18.122 --> 00:09:21.205
scoop up all of that sauce because...

00:09:22.455 --> 00:09:26.122
You gotta scoop up all
of that tomato sauce.

00:09:30.446 --> 00:09:33.540
That really mops up all of this sauce, and

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:35.770
you can definitely,
actually after I tasted

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:38.425
the other dish, which is just pure tomato,

00:09:38.425 --> 00:09:40.279
and then going back to
the tripe dish, you can

00:09:40.279 --> 00:09:42.908
definitely tell that it has a bit of a,

00:09:42.908 --> 00:09:44.801
an organy taste.

00:09:44.801 --> 00:09:47.978
The name of the restaurant
is Luzzi, and that was,

00:09:47.978 --> 00:09:51.391
what I really liked was
that tripe dish, if you can

00:09:51.391 --> 00:09:54.891
imagine a texture that is both very soft,

00:09:56.491 --> 00:09:58.945
but slightly chewy at the
same time, and I know that

00:09:58.945 --> 00:10:01.486
sounds kind of ironic, but
as soon as you have that

00:10:01.486 --> 00:10:04.579
tripe dish you'll know
exactly that contrast.

00:10:04.579 --> 00:10:06.087
One of the reasons we
ate here is because it's

00:10:06.087 --> 00:10:08.617
right on the route of
where we're gonna be going,

00:10:08.617 --> 00:10:10.950
we're gonna be visiting
some churches next, and it's

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:13.861
just kind of on the back
side of the Colosseum.

00:10:13.861 --> 00:10:16.959
We are walking towards the
Basilica di San Giovanni,

00:10:16.959 --> 00:10:19.364
but on the way we were gonna
stop at the Basilica di

00:10:19.364 --> 00:10:22.624
San Clemente, but unfortunately
they have just now

00:10:22.624 --> 00:10:25.370
closed for lunch, we just
missed it, and they won't

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:27.332
open up for another couple
of hours, so I don't

00:10:27.332 --> 00:10:29.697
think we're gonna hang
around, we're on our way

00:10:29.697 --> 00:10:31.364
now to San Giovanni.

00:10:36.166 --> 00:10:38.833
(upbeat music)

00:10:42.485 --> 00:10:45.197
The Basilica di San
Giovanni was commissioned by

00:10:45.197 --> 00:10:48.846
Constantine in 324,
and it is significantly

00:10:48.846 --> 00:10:51.374
important in Rome because it was the first

00:10:51.374 --> 00:10:54.541
Christian Basilica in all of the city.

00:10:56.519 --> 00:10:58.636
We just got through security,
and we have entered into

00:10:58.636 --> 00:11:02.429
the foyer entrance way of
the Basilica, and it is

00:11:02.429 --> 00:11:06.641
just stunning, it's huge
and the detail in the walls,

00:11:06.641 --> 00:11:10.384
in the columns, in the floor, is amazing.

00:11:10.384 --> 00:11:13.884
And then also the doors are just gigantic.

00:11:24.377 --> 00:11:26.907
It almost takes my breath
away, and what really

00:11:26.907 --> 00:11:31.111
strikes me right off the
bat, are the marble statues

00:11:31.111 --> 00:11:34.953
lining the side of the
cathedral, of the 12 apostles,

00:11:34.953 --> 00:11:38.831
and then the roof is
golden, with so much detail.

00:11:38.831 --> 00:11:41.876
You just walk in here and
literally this sense of like

00:11:41.876 --> 00:11:45.626
peace and quiet and calm
just overwhelms you.

00:11:48.283 --> 00:11:49.921
And I'm just gonna stop
talking right now and

00:11:49.921 --> 00:11:52.004
just listen to the peace.

00:11:57.107 --> 00:11:59.767
That was just amazing to
walk inside the Basilica,

00:11:59.767 --> 00:12:02.517
it's so big and yeah, just such a

00:12:03.375 --> 00:12:05.851
quiet, calm, peaceful place.

00:12:05.851 --> 00:12:08.518
We just walked across the
street from the Basilica di

00:12:08.518 --> 00:12:11.560
San Giovanni, and right
here there's another chapel,

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:15.203
and inside there's
supposedly a staircase that

00:12:15.203 --> 00:12:19.447
Jesus walked up at Pontius
Pilate's palace in Jerusalem,

00:12:19.447 --> 00:12:22.701
and then the staircase was
brought to Rome, and so

00:12:22.701 --> 00:12:25.162
you cannot walk up the
staircase on your feet, but you

00:12:25.162 --> 00:12:27.650
have to walk up on your
knees, and with every step

00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:30.802
that you take on your
knees you also say a prayer

00:12:30.802 --> 00:12:34.133
until you reach the top of all 28 steps.

00:12:34.133 --> 00:12:36.362
Ying and I are gonna make
the climb up the staircase

00:12:36.362 --> 00:12:37.445
on our knees.

00:12:45.188 --> 00:12:47.988
Ying did a really good
job, but I was definitely

00:12:47.988 --> 00:12:49.988
in pain the entire time.

00:12:54.732 --> 00:12:58.815
I actually wasn't expecting
it to hurt that much.

00:12:59.807 --> 00:13:02.158
I think that took us about 15 minutes, and

00:13:02.158 --> 00:13:04.455
you just kind of creep
up the steps very slowly,

00:13:04.455 --> 00:13:06.538
but it was well worth it.

00:13:10.253 --> 00:13:12.633
We walked back to the
Metro, we're gonna take it

00:13:12.633 --> 00:13:15.633
a couple of stops to our next place.

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:21.721
We got off the Metro at
Barberini Station, and we

00:13:21.721 --> 00:13:25.221
are gonna walk towards the Trevi Fountain.

00:13:26.795 --> 00:13:29.378
(upbeat music)

00:13:40.102 --> 00:13:42.852
Hello, can I have the three cone?

00:13:44.255 --> 00:13:47.255
Chocolate chip, chocolate chip Ying.

00:13:48.532 --> 00:13:50.449
And anything else Ying?

00:13:52.519 --> 00:13:54.352
Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:13:56.325 --> 00:13:58.847
- I don't know if anybody
ever comes to Rome

00:13:58.847 --> 00:14:01.293
without having some gelato,
there are many places

00:14:01.293 --> 00:14:04.285
to get gelato around this
area, we came to a place

00:14:04.285 --> 00:14:07.187
called Gelateria
Valentino, we ordered half

00:14:07.187 --> 00:14:09.854
chocolate chip and half coconut.

00:14:13.737 --> 00:14:17.904
Oh yeah, that is pretty
awesome, really really milky.

00:14:23.268 --> 00:14:25.466
Wow the coconut is really good too.

00:14:25.466 --> 00:14:28.805
It has again a really, really
milky, milky, creamy flavor

00:14:28.805 --> 00:14:31.786
to it, and even a very smooth texture.

00:14:31.786 --> 00:14:33.546
And then in the coconut
you can have, you feel the

00:14:33.546 --> 00:14:36.796
little pieces of dried coconut as well.

00:14:44.739 --> 00:14:47.422
And that gelato should
lead us to what is one of

00:14:47.422 --> 00:14:50.299
the most iconic sights in all of Rome.

00:14:50.299 --> 00:14:53.869
I'm gonna look over to my right hand side.

00:14:53.869 --> 00:14:55.202
And there it is.

00:14:56.666 --> 00:14:59.249
(upbeat music)

00:15:11.685 --> 00:15:14.096
As much as that was cool
to see, we are pretty hot

00:15:14.096 --> 00:15:16.333
and tired now, so Ying and I
are heading back to the hotel,

00:15:16.333 --> 00:15:19.031
we're gonna spend a couple
of hours, and tonight we have

00:15:19.031 --> 00:15:22.882
a very special big dinner
coming up, stay tuned,

00:15:22.882 --> 00:15:24.008
dinner coming soon.

00:15:24.008 --> 00:15:26.577
Tonight Ying and I are
going to go meet Valentina

00:15:26.577 --> 00:15:30.188
and Antonio, and they
are from Rome, they were

00:15:30.188 --> 00:15:33.788
really helpful and they
reached out to me when I

00:15:33.788 --> 00:15:35.979
mentioned that I was coming
to Rome, and they really

00:15:35.979 --> 00:15:38.602
helped me put together a
good itinerary of what to do

00:15:38.602 --> 00:15:41.912
and see, and also eat, in
Rome, so we're going to

00:15:41.912 --> 00:15:45.071
meet them for dinner
tonight, I am predicting

00:15:45.071 --> 00:15:46.654
a very good dinner.

00:15:51.504 --> 00:15:54.691
We arrived at Piazza di
Spagna, and this is another

00:15:54.691 --> 00:15:58.742
famous plaza in Rome,
there are the Spanish steps

00:15:58.742 --> 00:16:01.093
over here but it looks
like they are doing some

00:16:01.093 --> 00:16:02.867
renovation on them right
now, so I don't think

00:16:02.867 --> 00:16:06.554
they're open, but then
it's a nice plaza to just

00:16:06.554 --> 00:16:09.637
walk around and people watch as well.

00:16:10.486 --> 00:16:12.858
We are walking on our
way to dinner now, and we

00:16:12.858 --> 00:16:15.691
have just stopped by the Pantheon.

00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:19.279
But we're gonna come back
tomorrow to go inside

00:16:19.279 --> 00:16:21.669
and to explore more, we're
just kinda passing through

00:16:21.669 --> 00:16:24.648
but it is just a breathtaking sight.

00:16:24.648 --> 00:16:27.231
(upbeat music)

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:36.850
(Italian conversation)

00:16:42.295 --> 00:16:45.614
- He's not sure about the
rabbit, he has to catch it first.

00:16:45.614 --> 00:16:48.864
(Italian conversation)

00:17:08.196 --> 00:17:11.529
(Italian conversation)

00:17:15.802 --> 00:17:19.203
- We met up with Valentina
and Antonio, and we have

00:17:19.203 --> 00:17:22.961
come to a restaurant
called Trattoria Dal Gino,

00:17:22.961 --> 00:17:26.773
and it specializes in
especially Roman style dishes.

00:17:26.773 --> 00:17:28.953
So normally it would be common
for you to have your own

00:17:28.953 --> 00:17:31.236
plate of pasta and you
would eat by yourself?

00:17:31.236 --> 00:17:32.793
- [Antonio] Everyone chooses it's own.

00:17:32.793 --> 00:17:36.593
- [Mark] Okay, but we
have decided to combine

00:17:36.593 --> 00:17:39.555
Italian food with Asian
eating style, so we're

00:17:39.555 --> 00:17:41.929
gonna have a bunch of dishes
and share them all together,

00:17:41.929 --> 00:17:45.168
so that we can taste all
of the different dishes.

00:17:45.168 --> 00:17:47.251
This one is cacio e pepe.

00:17:49.094 --> 00:17:53.237
- [Antonio] Cacio is
the other Roman name for

00:17:53.237 --> 00:17:54.596
sheep cheese.

00:17:54.596 --> 00:17:56.096
- [Mark] Ah, okay.

00:18:00.609 --> 00:18:03.129
And then this one is the carbonara.

00:18:03.129 --> 00:18:06.814
With eggs.
- [Antonio] Pork cheeks.

00:18:06.814 --> 00:18:08.686
- [Mark] Pork cheeks.
- [Antonio] And pepper.

00:18:08.686 --> 00:18:09.963
- [Mark] Thank you very much.

00:18:09.963 --> 00:18:12.504
- [Antonio] You should
take this, this and that,

00:18:12.504 --> 00:18:14.587
and you scrape it on top.

00:18:18.281 --> 00:18:20.296
- [Mark] Antonio says --
- [Antonio] That side.

00:18:20.296 --> 00:18:23.139
- [Mark] Oh, other side, okay, okay.

00:18:23.139 --> 00:18:26.843
Antonio says always more
cheese is a good idea.

00:18:26.843 --> 00:18:27.843
What type of cheese is this?

00:18:27.843 --> 00:18:29.453
- [Antonio] This is sheep cheese.

00:18:29.453 --> 00:18:31.079
- [Mark] Sheep cheese.
- [Antonio] Roman sheep cheese

00:18:31.079 --> 00:18:33.326
- [Mark] Roman sheep cheese, wow.

00:18:33.326 --> 00:18:36.663
And then, over both
pastas? Over everything?

00:18:36.663 --> 00:18:40.109
- [Antonio] Just put it, in
Rome we say cheese like it rains

00:18:40.109 --> 00:18:41.276
- [Mark] Okay.

00:18:50.227 --> 00:18:54.342
Alright, I gotta begin with the carbonara.

00:18:54.342 --> 00:18:56.592
Twist a, twist a fork bite.

00:19:02.485 --> 00:19:03.453
Mine's gonna be a big bite.

00:19:03.453 --> 00:19:05.116
- [Antonio] If you're
not careful, you're gonna

00:19:05.116 --> 00:19:06.217
get everything.

00:19:06.217 --> 00:19:08.305
- [Mark] Sauce all over, yes.

00:19:08.305 --> 00:19:11.807
Okay, I gotta work on my
fork, okay there we go,

00:19:11.807 --> 00:19:14.307
I think I've got a nice twirl.

00:19:18.748 --> 00:19:19.581
Oh yeah.

00:19:21.378 --> 00:19:22.529
Wow.

00:19:22.529 --> 00:19:24.996
And this is also cooked
with pork cheek, so there's

00:19:24.996 --> 00:19:27.368
little pieces of pork
cheek in here, and that

00:19:27.368 --> 00:19:29.976
gives a lot of flavor to
the entire dish, and also

00:19:29.976 --> 00:19:33.416
you can taste that black
pepper in there as well.

00:19:33.416 --> 00:19:36.749
That is just absolute rich deliciousness

00:19:37.935 --> 00:19:39.579
coating the noodles.

00:19:39.579 --> 00:19:41.496
I'll try this one next.

00:19:53.423 --> 00:19:56.173
Wow, okay that one is incredible.

00:19:57.272 --> 00:20:01.285
The combination of that
sheep cheese, which has this

00:20:01.285 --> 00:20:05.452
like salty, kind of complex
cheese flavor, and then

00:20:06.603 --> 00:20:10.896
it's complemented so well
just with that black pepper.

00:20:10.896 --> 00:20:14.125
And then just coating
that pasta, that is a,

00:20:14.125 --> 00:20:18.889
just a superb combination,
it tastes just simple, but

00:20:18.889 --> 00:20:23.056
all about the flavor from
that cheese, and the pepper.

00:20:24.068 --> 00:20:27.318
(Italian conversation)

00:20:29.599 --> 00:20:30.996
Oh the wine is amazing.

00:20:30.996 --> 00:20:31.848
- [Antonio] The wine's good huh?

00:20:31.848 --> 00:20:35.015
- [Mark] Yeah, oh it's so like smooth.

00:20:37.469 --> 00:20:39.052
Oh, grazie, grazie.

00:20:44.636 --> 00:20:48.495
And we also got another
pasta, with anchovies and

00:20:48.495 --> 00:20:51.828
tomatoes, and anything else in this one?

00:20:53.028 --> 00:20:55.861
Anchovies and tomatoes and garlic.

00:20:57.915 --> 00:21:00.311
And sheeps' cheese, also.

00:21:00.311 --> 00:21:03.144
And this one is the house special.

00:21:14.155 --> 00:21:17.187
This one is really good
too, you can taste,

00:21:17.187 --> 00:21:19.061
of course you can taste the anchovies.

00:21:19.061 --> 00:21:22.576
A little bit of cheese
in there, and then also,

00:21:22.576 --> 00:21:25.826
I think some kind of
parsley in there as well.

00:21:25.826 --> 00:21:28.826
That tastes like kind of refreshing.

00:21:31.736 --> 00:21:34.570
Adding a little extra pepper.

00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:38.846
All of the pastas are
just unbelievably good,

00:21:38.846 --> 00:21:41.814
I really, I think I really
loved that one with the

00:21:41.814 --> 00:21:45.897
sheep's cheese, and pepper,
that combination just

00:21:47.049 --> 00:21:49.395
complements each other so
well, but the carbonara

00:21:49.395 --> 00:21:53.284
is also impressively
good, it's so rich, and

00:21:53.284 --> 00:21:58.077
so like, yeah it's just
incredibly rich and creamy

00:21:58.077 --> 00:22:01.818
and just packed with flavor,
the butter, the eggs,

00:22:01.818 --> 00:22:04.926
the pig cheek, and I
definitely need to work on

00:22:04.926 --> 00:22:06.176
my pasta twirl.

00:22:10.559 --> 00:22:13.809
(Italian conversation)

00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:28.571
All of the pasta, that
was only the beginning

00:22:28.571 --> 00:22:32.332
of this meal, we have now
moved on to the main courses,

00:22:32.332 --> 00:22:35.618
and we have a bunch of different dishes.

00:22:35.618 --> 00:22:39.470
We got some liver, which is
a Venice style preparation,

00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:42.405
boiled beef which is then
fried and then combined with

00:22:42.405 --> 00:22:45.503
tomatoes and onions and
pine fruit, and then this is

00:22:45.503 --> 00:22:48.441
another interesting vegetable
dish that we got here,

00:22:48.441 --> 00:22:52.312
which is chicory weeds,
which I don't think I've ever

00:22:52.312 --> 00:22:54.956
had before, rabbit which
looks like it's, I think

00:22:54.956 --> 00:22:59.123
it's been braised in some
wine, and also rosemary,

00:23:00.347 --> 00:23:03.268
and then the final meat
dish I think we got is veal,

00:23:03.268 --> 00:23:06.626
thin strips of veal, with prosciutto?

00:23:06.626 --> 00:23:08.334
- Prosciutto.
- Prosciutto,

00:23:08.334 --> 00:23:12.525
with prosciutto on top, and
then with fresh sage on top,

00:23:12.525 --> 00:23:14.421
butter and white wine sauce.

00:23:14.421 --> 00:23:18.504
I'm gonna start with the
liver, liver and onions.

00:23:21.076 --> 00:23:21.909
Oh yeah.

00:23:25.006 --> 00:23:28.589
I love liver, oh that's
really nice because

00:23:29.941 --> 00:23:32.709
you can actually taste
the white wine in there,

00:23:32.709 --> 00:23:36.399
and I also got a piece of
sage in that bite as well.

00:23:36.399 --> 00:23:37.790
That sage is wonderful.

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:40.795
Okay onto the rabbit, and
it looks like I got the,

00:23:40.795 --> 00:23:42.795
I got some ribs portion.

00:23:45.995 --> 00:23:47.745
Let me flip him over.

00:23:50.071 --> 00:23:51.192
Oh it's okay to grab it?

00:23:51.192 --> 00:23:55.359
Okay, I think it's maybe easier
to grab it with my fingers.

00:24:00.689 --> 00:24:01.522
Wow.

00:24:04.021 --> 00:24:08.017
The rabbit is amazing, it's so tender.

00:24:08.017 --> 00:24:10.934
It's almost like dark meat chicken.

00:24:13.302 --> 00:24:16.385
Onto the beef now, with the tomatoes.

00:24:23.584 --> 00:24:24.417
Wow.

00:24:26.994 --> 00:24:28.994
Yeah, that is a stunner.

00:24:31.656 --> 00:24:34.500
That beef, again it's
fall-apart tender but it

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:38.772
sort of like, it sort of
like flakes in your mouth.

00:24:38.772 --> 00:24:42.689
And then that's like a,
a sweet, but like very,

00:24:43.639 --> 00:24:47.222
very fragrant tomato
and onion topping, and

00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:51.594
I'm trying to distinguish
the spices in there,

00:24:51.594 --> 00:24:55.011
the herbs and there's definitely the pine,

00:24:55.011 --> 00:24:59.086
the pine cone fruit, in
there, although I'm not sure

00:24:59.086 --> 00:25:02.342
if I can decipher that on
it's own, but also there's

00:25:02.342 --> 00:25:04.152
a little bit, Antonio was
telling me that there's

00:25:04.152 --> 00:25:07.766
also a little bit of
fennel in there as well,

00:25:07.766 --> 00:25:10.752
that's an amazingly,
an amazing combination,

00:25:10.752 --> 00:25:12.285
that's delicious.

00:25:12.285 --> 00:25:15.180
Veal, let me take out a
toothpick, and you can see

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:17.347
that piece of sage on top.

00:25:25.198 --> 00:25:26.031
Oh yeah.

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:30.041
That is awesome as well.

00:25:30.041 --> 00:25:34.305
The sage on there is what
gives it it's twist of flavor.

00:25:34.305 --> 00:25:38.472
This is the vegetable, that
chicory, the chicory leaves.

00:25:39.324 --> 00:25:43.407
We're eating that sort of
at the end of the meal.

00:25:46.362 --> 00:25:49.121
Just a hint of a bitter taste to it.

00:25:49.121 --> 00:25:51.171
Really good, and you can
taste that it's fried

00:25:51.171 --> 00:25:52.442
with garlic as well.

00:25:52.442 --> 00:25:55.988
I have a piece of bread, in
Italian it's called scarpetta,

00:25:55.988 --> 00:25:59.217
and what you do is you
take a piece of bread,

00:25:59.217 --> 00:26:03.816
I'll go over here to this
plate, and you just mop up

00:26:03.816 --> 00:26:07.983
all of that juice and oil
and flavor from that dish,

00:26:09.392 --> 00:26:12.144
oh and some rosemary as
well, you mop that all up,

00:26:12.144 --> 00:26:14.196
you get that all in there, and you

00:26:14.196 --> 00:26:16.279
clean the plate that way.

00:26:22.347 --> 00:26:24.906
That would make any type
of bread taste good.

00:26:24.906 --> 00:26:27.948
We finished off all of the
food, and we decided it

00:26:27.948 --> 00:26:32.456
would be a great idea to
order one more dish, and

00:26:32.456 --> 00:26:36.123
not only any one dish,
but a baby lamb dish.

00:26:39.679 --> 00:26:42.512
Oh that just, oh that's beautiful.

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:50.903
Wow.

00:26:51.947 --> 00:26:53.197
That is like...

00:26:54.672 --> 00:26:57.892
It almost has a creamy
texture, it's fantastic,

00:26:57.892 --> 00:27:01.329
and again that like, butter, I'm guessing

00:27:01.329 --> 00:27:04.829
butter and white wine sauce with rosemary.

00:27:05.689 --> 00:27:08.939
(Italian conversation)

00:27:33.437 --> 00:27:35.104
Thank you very much.

00:27:40.690 --> 00:27:44.305
Mmmm, wow, you can taste
all those herbs in there.

00:27:44.305 --> 00:27:46.835
- It's about a hundred herbs or something.

00:27:46.835 --> 00:27:48.573
- It almost has a little
bit of an anise flavor,

00:27:48.573 --> 00:27:51.269
a little bit of a peppermint
flavor, a little bit of a,

00:27:51.269 --> 00:27:55.102
and that's the combination
of all those herbs.

00:28:09.769 --> 00:28:11.021
Do we stand here and have it?

00:28:11.021 --> 00:28:13.688
- [Antonio] We stand here, yeah.

00:28:18.610 --> 00:28:20.865
- [Mark] Probably one of
the best Italian meals I've

00:28:20.865 --> 00:28:24.865
ever had, huge thank you

00:28:24.865 --> 00:28:27.171

00:28:47.293 --> 00:28:49.210
(beep)

00:28:50.216 --> 00:28:52.659
Or some of that pepper.

00:28:52.659 --> 00:28:56.826
Oh, I'm using the, I'm
using the knife upside down.

00:28:59.650 --> 00:29:01.760
In Italian it's called carpetta.

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:03.535
- [Antonio] Scarpetta.
- [Mark] Scarpetta.

00:29:03.535 --> 00:29:06.285
In Italian it's called scarpetta.

00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:10.137
(upbeat music)
