00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:04.660
- [Announcer] This program
is a presentation of UCTV

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.803
for educational and
noncommercial use only.

00:00:10.802 --> 00:00:13.219
(soft music)

00:00:43.227 --> 00:00:44.780
- It's a very happy occasion

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.962
because we on the
Foerster Lecture Committee

00:00:47.962 --> 00:00:50.375
have been trying to tempt

00:00:50.375 --> 00:00:53.580
Professor Bynum here for several years,

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.890
and at last we have succeeded.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.660
We're very pleased, indeed, about that.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.440
She does need no introduction,
but she's going to get one,

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.240
although, nothing like
as full as one could give

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.933
or, as indeed, she would deserve.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.230
We always give a brief biography here,

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.070
so I just like to tell
you that Professor Bynum

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.543
received her BA from
University of Michigan,

00:01:18.543 --> 00:01:23.040
and her MA and PhD from
Harvard University,

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.460
where she's taught.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.550
At the University of
Washington, where she's taught,

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.670
and Columbia University.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.090
In 1999 she became the
first woman to be appointed

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.601
university professor at Columbia,

00:01:35.601 --> 00:01:39.501
a position she held until
she left a few years ago

00:01:39.501 --> 00:01:43.460
for the Institute for
Advanced Study in Princeton,

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.290
where she is now professor

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.860
of the Western European Middle Ages

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.670
in the School of Historical
Studies at the Institute.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.645
She's received innumerable
awards and honors

00:01:55.645 --> 00:01:58.990
including being a MacArthur Fellow,

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.789
and in 2001 she was awarded
the Centennial Medal

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.960
of the Harvard Graduate
School of Arts and Sciences.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.350
A very, very, distinguished
career, indeed.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.680
So please join me in
welcoming, Caroline Bynum,

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.732
who will lecture to us on
Explaining Transformation:

00:02:16.732 --> 00:02:20.820
Material Miracles and Their Theorists

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.178
in the Later Middle Ages.

00:02:23.178 --> 00:02:25.428
(applause)

00:02:26.518 --> 00:02:27.560
- Thank you so much.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.450
I'm glad you persuaded me, finally,

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.570
to come out here after several years,

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.040
which were very busy years for me,

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.160
but this is coming to the West
Coast is always coming home

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.740
because I spent many years at
the University of Washington,

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.670
and while I was there I
had very close friends

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.520
down here at Berkeley, many
of whom are still here,

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.140
and came down at one point, actually,

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.071
to work on a textbook project
with people here at Berkeley,

00:02:50.071 --> 00:02:52.793
so I was in and out a lot.

00:02:53.693 --> 00:02:55.210
This is a wonderful campus,

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.170
there are wonderful,
wonderful people here.

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.710
I'm very grateful for the
invitation to be here,

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:01.440
so thank you very much.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.000
Explaining Transformation:
Material Miracles

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.433
and Their Theorists in
the Later Middle Ages.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.490
As is well known, miracles
were an important part

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.670
of medieval Christianity.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.640
Although protestants in
the 16th and 17th centuries

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.520
debated whether the age of miracles

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.434
had ended with Christ's ascension,

00:03:20.434 --> 00:03:23.628
or with the triumph of
Christianity under Constantine,

00:03:23.628 --> 00:03:25.429
most medieval theologians

00:03:25.429 --> 00:03:28.910
thought miracles continued
into their own day.

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.205
However much preachers might
emphasize inner virtues,

00:03:32.205 --> 00:03:36.773
miracles remained crucial
signs, even proofs of sanctity.

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.150
Recent historians have
been much interested

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.470
in medieval discussions
of the supernatural,

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.850
and have agreed that it was
only in the early modern period

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.090
that a theory of miracle as an event

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.270
that violates the laws of
nature was clearly worked out.

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.520
They've emphasized that
theologians after Thomas Aquinas

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.510
did understand miracle as
something above or beyond nature,

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.600
but they've also stressed
that medieval writers

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.538
continued the New Testament tradition

00:04:03.538 --> 00:04:08.340
of understanding miracles
and marvels as signs of God.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.460
In the wake of the recent flood of studies

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.267
of the marvelous and the bizarre,

00:04:12.267 --> 00:04:14.220
much attention has been devoted

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.050
to the theoretical distinctions

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:19.741
medieval thinkers worked out
between magic and marvels,

00:04:19.741 --> 00:04:21.810
which we do not understand,

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.680
but which might be explained naturally

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.430
if we did understand them,

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.870
and miracles which are done by God

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.780
beyond the ordinary
regularities of the world,

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.491
but reading medieval texts
makes it quickly clear

00:04:34.491 --> 00:04:38.250
that for all the occasional
theoretical distinction,

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:43.133
the terms marvel and miracle
were used remarkably fluidly.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.310
Now I don't want to talk today
about miracles generally,

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.600
or even about the theoretical distinction

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.600
between miracula, miracles,
and merobilia, marvels.

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.599
Rather, I want to discuss a
particular kind of miracle,

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:01.130
the transformation miracle.

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:02.820
All right, the transformation miracle.

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.390
This is my subject, so this
is an important definition.

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:09.410
It's a miracle in which
material or bodily stuff

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.500
metamorphoses into something else,

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.320
often remaining as such,

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.350
and becoming a place
of pilgrimage or cult.

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.800
I argue that this type of miracle

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.966
became more common in
the later Middle Ages,

00:05:20.966 --> 00:05:24.240
especially the 14th and 15th centuries.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.070
Some miraculous transformations
were even creations

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:29.610
of the late Middle Ages.

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.026
In this lecture, I shall treat
not only their appearance,

00:05:32.026 --> 00:05:35.310
but also some of the theories
intellectuals evolved

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.360
for dealing with them and
the conception of matter

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.533
that lay behind their discussions.

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.540
Now, of course, material
objects were central

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.610
to Christian practice
throughout the Middle Ages.

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.100
Despite the arguments
of learned theologians

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.370
that images only gestured toward
the saints and the divine,

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.550
people behaved in some cases
as if they were the saints.

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.200
Moreover, holy matter was
prominent in other ways.

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:07.200
As relics and contact relics,
sacraments, and sacramentals.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.920
Indeed, such objects
tended to be conflated.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.950
Some panel paintings and
three-dimensional sculptures

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:16.140
contained relics,

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:20.760
hints what modern art historians
would call iconography,

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:25.410
or image of actually
became the thing itself.

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:29.420
You can see in this slide
of the Karlstejn Chapel

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:34.420
that here Christ has a relic
of the true cross in his chest,

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.970
a relic of the crown
of thorns in the halo,

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:40.980
a relic of the nail in the nail,

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.810
a little bit of the sponge here,

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:45.350
and a relic of the lance

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:48.070
that pierced his side in the side wound.

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:52.313
So, obviously, here we
find that relic and image

00:06:52.313 --> 00:06:54.550
have become conflated,

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:57.500
but, conversely, animated images,

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.870
and transformed Eucharistic
wafers became relics.

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:02.510
In other words, here you have an image

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:05.410
which is becoming a relic because
relics are embedded in it,

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:07.985
but you also have material
objects which themselves

00:07:07.985 --> 00:07:11.015
become relics asserting
their transcendence,

00:07:11.015 --> 00:07:13.410
that is their more than ordinariness

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:17.020
exactly by asserting their materiality.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:19.650
Indeed, we often do not know whether

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:21.550
late medieval monstrances,

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:24.805
that is containers contained relics,

00:07:24.805 --> 00:07:27.480
the Eucharist, or other holy things.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.020
If the contents have been
lost, as they often have,

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:31.500
because art historians
are often interested

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.340
in the container and not the contents.

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:34.750
If the contents have been lost,

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:38.890
we often don't know what kind
of holy matter was in it.

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:41.580
So parallel, so similar were the ways,

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.240
liturgically and devotionally

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.290
in which these very different
kinds of objects were treated.

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:48.980
It was only in the period
after 1100, however,

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:50.617
that certain kinds of transformed,

00:07:50.617 --> 00:07:54.660
and animated materiality began to appear.

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:58.300
A vision received by
Peter Damian in about 1060

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:01.070
is usually considered
the first case of a claim

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:04.530
literally to drink
blood from the crucifix.

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:06.650
Assertions that bodies were literally,

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:09.430
and miraculously branded with the cross

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:12.930
first appear in accounts
of the first two crusades.

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:17.470
The earliest cases of stigmata
are late 12th century.

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:20.830
By the 14th century
they are often depicted

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:24.230
as inscribings into the
body of the adherent,

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:28.720
not by Christ, but by a
devotional object, the crucifix.

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.880
This is a very, very
typical medieval depiction

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:35.160
of the stigmata of Francis.

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.470
You can see that the
miracle is not presented

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:40.160
as the impression of Christ in Francis,

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:42.700
it's the impression of the crucifix

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:45.060
on which Francis was
meditating at the time,

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:48.590
into Francis's body.

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:51.510
So it's the devotional
object that has the impact

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:54.030
that is inscribed into
the body of the saint,

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:57.350
and not Christ body per se.

00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:59.380
As we know from Katie Park's work,

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:02.900
15th century canonization
processes began to investigate

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:05.380
the physical interiors of holy bodies,

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:06.960
especially female bodies,

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.720
to look for material proof of sanctity

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.390
such as marvelous kidney or heart stones

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:14.603
incised with religious scenes.

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:19.849
Eucharistic visions were
recounted in late antiquity,

00:09:19.849 --> 00:09:21.780
and the Carolingian period,

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:24.640
but, and this is the important point,

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:27.360
these early visions are
accompanied by prayers

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.970
that God return the transformed

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:31.700
flesh and blood to bread and wine,

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.180
so people will not be
afraid to receive it.

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:37.120
In other words, the
early texts warn against

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:40.940
making any claim that the
transformed stuff endures.

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:43.280
What German historians call Dauerwunder,

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:45.780
that is miracles in which
the Eucharistic wafer,

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:48.730
or the wine is transformed
into flesh and blood,

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:53.080
and remains as such appear around 1200.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:56.580
They're found in large numbers after 1290.

00:09:56.580 --> 00:10:00.260
Now here you have an image
of one such miracle host,

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:04.800
the miracle was alleged to
have occurred before 1433,

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:08.040
they're vague allegations
of Jewish desecration,

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:11.500
but we don't actually know
the origin of the object.

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:13.640
What we have, however,
is the object was given

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:18.210
by the Pope Eugene IV
to the Duke of Burgundy.

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:20.640
This particular pope was an enthusiastic

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:23.340
supporter of these kinds
of material miracles,

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:26.550
and we then what we
have here is a miniature

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:30.240
depicting the miraculous
object in the monstrance,

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:35.240
so made about 60 years or so
after the alleged miracle.

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.756
This is one of these Dauerwunder.

00:10:37.756 --> 00:10:41.360
In Brandenburg alone, the
area of Northern Germany,

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:44.040
in which I did research for my last book,

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:46.370
which Professor Long
mentioned the Wonderful Blood,

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:48.770
there were dozens and
dozens of such claims

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:51.000
by the mid 15th century.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.450
Most instances of animated
statues and paintings

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:56.270
are 14th and 15th century,

00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:59.070
and what is particularly
significant from my argument

00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:01.330
is the fact that animated images

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:04.360
are usually themselves older objects

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:07.340
that have recently been
neglected and revived

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:11.380
one or two hundred years
later to reinvigorate cult.

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:16.380
Here, for example, is the
image from Prato in Italy,

00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:18.970
which is still venerated today.

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:21.170
In this case it's a 14th century image

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:24.347
that supposedly came
alive in the 15th century

00:11:24.347 --> 00:11:28.080
a child supposedly saw the virgin get down

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.160
from the wall and walk around,

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.020
and he ran and told other
people and they came,

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:35.690
and the virgin smiled at
them and she winked at them

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:37.540
so they got the bishop and the bishop came

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:38.937
and cult was established,

00:11:38.937 --> 00:11:41.953
and this image is still venerated today.

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:45.070
Relics that bleed, ooze,

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:48.450
transport themselves through
space, glow with light,

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:53.210
or even create other
material such as manna.

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:56.670
A number of saints
tombs are said to create

00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:59.230
their own kind of miraculous manna

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:02.460
that falls from heaven
on devotees who come.

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:05.130
So all these kinds of
objects which animate,

00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:07.130
and even possibly produce stuff

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:10.890
are often older objects
newly come to life.

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:13.270
The blood of Saint Januarius in Naples

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:15.370
that has liquified several times a year

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:19.820
since the 14th century is
supposedly a 4th century relic.

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:21.660
Took it a thousand years to decide

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:24.400
to regularly come to life.

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.570
Moreover, such transformed
objects were regularly

00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:30.510
alleged to transfer
their power via contact

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:33.120
with physical copies of themselves.

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:36.760
Sometimes, clay models
actually made of holy dirt

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:40.630
impregnated with the saints
body or with Eucharistic blood.

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:42.110
So in this kind of case,

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:45.650
where a pilgrim taking away from a site

00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:48.680
an image of the miracle
which is actually made

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:50.850
from the dirt of the tomb,

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:55.850
you see, it's both an image
and it's a physical contact

00:12:56.130 --> 00:13:00.830
carrying the sacred power with it.

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:02.680
Although free standing sculptures emerged

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:04.050
by the Carolingian period,

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:05.660
and were sometimes themselves

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:09.560
a conflation of relic container
and mimetic representation,

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:11.720
religious art objects of all sorts

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:13.616
proliferated in the late Middle Ages

00:13:13.616 --> 00:13:17.340
as village churches became
able to commission statuary,

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:19.177
altar pieces, and panel paintings,

00:13:19.177 --> 00:13:22.940
and aristocratic laity to
purchase illuminated manuscripts,

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:25.390
and small devotional objects.

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:27.350
Such objects sometimes called attention

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:30.030
to their materiality
and transformative power

00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:32.270
quite overtly by tetchily

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:35.320
which explained that the
devout should fondle,

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:38.690
and kiss them in order to receive rewards.

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:41.210
Here you have two examples.

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:44.210
On your right you have
a devotional object,

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:46.040
which you see is actually abraded

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:48.230
to the point of being effaced

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:51.160
by people kissing the
central part of the object.

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:54.410
Here what you have is a devotional object

00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:56.470
representing something similar that is,

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:57.560
the wound of Christ,

00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:59.180
and what you have is the tetchily

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:01.360
which tell you that you should kiss it.

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:04.840
Indeed, this is a very interesting object

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:07.416
because the little cross in the middle

00:14:07.416 --> 00:14:09.540
what it says on this side

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:11.390
is that if you multiply it by 40 times

00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:14.158
you get the actual length of Christ.

00:14:14.158 --> 00:14:15.840
Then, if you kiss it,

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:19.260
you get seven years of
indulgence from the pope.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:20.640
So you can see the tactility,

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:24.440
the physicality of these objects.

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:26.730
At the same time that
all this is happening,

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:28.890
of course, as all of you know,

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:32.370
image hating and image bashing increased.

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:35.560
As did spirited rejection
of relics and Dauerwunder.

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:40.170
This is the period, obviously,
of medieval iconoclasm.

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:41.744
As many historians have noted,

00:14:41.744 --> 00:14:43.910
the fury of such attacks

00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:46.180
suggests how highly charged is the matter

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:49.170
that must be destroyed in these assaults.

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:52.130
Behind such phenomena,
both enthusiasmm for

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:55.490
transformed materiality
and the need to destroy it,

00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:58.100
lay a keen sense that matter is powerful,

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:01.593
hence dangerous because labile and alive.

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:04.710
Now there was considerable confusion,

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:07.360
both conceptual and practical about

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:10.340
this sort of Christian materiality.

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:13.170
In an effort not so much to
explain away this confusion,

00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:15.160
which is itself instructive,

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:18.660
as to probe for the assumptions
and anxieties behind it.

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:21.700
I turn now to address directly
what some philosophers,

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:24.770
and theologians said about holy matter.

00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:28.299
I do so by looking especially
at a few of the many places

00:15:28.299 --> 00:15:31.000
where they treat the topic of miracles.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.008
That is cases where matter,
under the direct action of God,

00:15:34.008 --> 00:15:39.008
ruptures the order of nature
God himself has established.

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:41.747
In what follows, as
you see on the outline,

00:15:41.747 --> 00:15:44.200
I'm going to do several things.

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:47.130
Having given you examples
of the kind of miracles

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:50.520
I'm talking about, which is
point one on the outline,

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:53.310
I shall now argue, point two,

00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:56.970
that the problem of miracles
was to medieval intellectuals

00:15:56.970 --> 00:16:00.440
a problem of the nature of the material.

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:02.640
Then, point three, I
shall consider briefly

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:04.550
some conceptions of matter

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:06.910
available to late medieval thinkers.

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:09.630
Finally, I shall argue
that both theologians,

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:13.030
and natural philosophers tried
to use the understandings

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:14.470
of matter available to them

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:18.009
to rein in the miraculous conceptually

00:16:18.009 --> 00:16:21.320
without denying it entirely.

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:24.430
In discussing this I shall
underline the basic contradiction

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:26.930
lurking behind all this ratiocination

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:29.500
the fact that the very
understandings of matter

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:32.746
that provided conceptual
tools for limiting change

00:16:32.746 --> 00:16:37.660
contributed to a growing sense
of it as dynamic substratum,

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:40.906
yet late medieval conceptions
of material transformation

00:16:40.906 --> 00:16:44.710
parallel the behavior of
actual transformed objects,

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:48.220
which simultaneously
proliferated and aroused

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:50.750
increasingly acute opposition,

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:52.270
so the kind of theories that you have

00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:54.214
are increasingly trying
to control the thing,

00:16:54.214 --> 00:16:55.740
but the theory itself

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:58.270
is making the thing more apt to happen,

00:16:58.270 --> 00:17:01.186
and this is exactly what the
things themselves are doing.

00:17:01.186 --> 00:17:05.070
These kinds of miracles are
happening more and more,

00:17:05.070 --> 00:17:08.340
and yet people's anger,
people's hostility,

00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:10.450
people's need to destroy it.

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:11.650
You all know what I'm talking about,

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:13.960
Lollards, Waldensians,
Hussites, this kind of thing,

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:15.713
is increasing at the same time.

00:17:16.585 --> 00:17:18.280
In the later Middle Ages

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.130
theologians and natural philosophers

00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:23.180
spilled a good deal of ink
discussing the miraculous,

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:26.260
but their focus seems to us an odd one.

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:29.350
From the 12th century on the
miracles actually recorded

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:31.140
as worked by holy people

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:34.150
were overwhelmingly miracles of healing,

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:37.500
but the paradigmatic miracles
discussed by intellectuals

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:41.560
were miracles of material transformation,

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:43.140
especially, the wedding at Cana

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:45.000
described in the Gospel of John

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.860
where Christ changed water into wine,

00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:49.290
and the contest between

00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:53.310
Aaron and Pharaoh's magicians in Exodus 7.

00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:56.010
Indeed, healings,
resurrections, and exorcisms

00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:57.980
were themselves treated as questions

00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:00.770
of the manipulation of bodily stuff,

00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:03.240
and delineating exactly how spirits,

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:06.120
either angels or demons
might interact with,

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:10.260
and employ bodies received
a great deal of attention.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.420
In the 12th century, Peter the Venerable,

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:15.365
argued that the distinction
between counterfeit miracles

00:18:15.365 --> 00:18:18.270
such as those of Pharaoh's magicians,

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:20.120
and true Christian ones

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:23.380
was not only that magic
had a natural cause,

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:25.970
and miracle a cause beyond nature,

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:29.140
but also that counterfeit
miracles vanished quickly,

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:31.900
and take much education to perform,

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:34.360
whereas, Christian miracles
are solid and real,

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:36.680
firmly rooted in matter.

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:38.810
A century later Albert the Great explained

00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:41.010
that both the marvelous and the miraculous

00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:45.450
result in real transformation
and stated decisively, quote,

00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:47.700
the method of miracles is this

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:50.060
the transformation of matter.

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:52.670
To Aquinas it is exactly because demons

00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:55.350
cannot fundamentally alter bodies,

00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:59.800
that the rods made by Pharaoh's
magicians are only magic,

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:02.350
and manipulations of natural change,

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:07.030
whereas, Aaron's seemingly,
exactly similar rods

00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:09.000
are miracles that is real,

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.180
and preternatural
transformations of matter.

00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:15.320
The 14th century philosopher
Nicholas of Autrecourt,

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:18.970
one of the very few medieval
thinkers to espouse atomism

00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:22.490
used a complex argument
about balance in the universe

00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:25.070
to suggest that bodily
resurrection is possible

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:28.680
because, quote, if a man who exists now

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:31.060
ceased to exist here in our hemisphere,

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:32.520
and were caused elsewhere,

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:35.210
and, again, ceased to
exist there sometime later,

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:36.850
and then were caused here

00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:39.710
he would be said to have risen, unquote.

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:41.900
Autrecourt's discussion is not so much

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:45.070
a fully naturalized
explanation of resurrection,

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:48.127
which almost all theologians
took to be a miracle

00:19:48.127 --> 00:19:51.090
as an analysis of the particulate nature

00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:53.063
of an eternity of matter.

00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:56.720
Even efforts we would not
consider to be physical

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:58.770
were understood as such.

00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:01.040
Fascinated as were other medieval thinkers

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:03.680
by examples of action at a distance

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:06.180
the 14th century theorist, Nicole Oresme,

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:09.990
argued that only bodies can act on bodies.

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:13.690
For body acts on another
body across intervening space

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:15.798
what really happens says Oresme,

00:20:15.798 --> 00:20:18.700
are examples like magnets
and things like this,

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:21.720
what really happens is
that the configuration,

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:24.750
the geometrical pattern of the first body,

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:27.000
or its member is altered.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.010
That configuration then
alters the medium between it,

00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:33.260
and the affected body which
is then itself altered,

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:35.980
so you see it's a physical process.

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:39.040
By the 15th century much of
the discussion of witches

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:40.800
which had earlier involved the charge

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:43.514
that it was heresy to
believe witchcraft possible

00:20:43.514 --> 00:20:46.800
came to focus on ways in
which witches might manipulate

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:49.840
alien bodies to achieve physical results,

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:52.750
such as riding animals
or collecting sperm,

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:54.880
and impregnating women.

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:56.480
In the same period, Jean Gerson,

00:20:57.410 --> 00:20:59.350
described the great 12th century saint,

00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:00.450
Bernard of Clairvaux,

00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:04.010
as quote, unquote, invaded by something,

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:06.600
when the power of miracle came over him.

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:09.360
Just as Jesus felt
something go out of himself

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:10.453
when the hemorrhaging woman

00:21:10.453 --> 00:21:14.400
touched his garment in Luke 8:46.

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.800
It is as if Gerson has to
think of spiritual power

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:21.785
as a quasi physical thing
entering and exiting the body,

00:21:21.785 --> 00:21:24.160
although, interestingly enough,

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:26.410
there's no source for
this way of putting it

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:28.890
in the original text Gerson draws on,

00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:31.910
so he's physicalizing
it as he interprets it.

00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:33.790
My point is not that all these theorists

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:36.000
were making the same argument.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.570
Oresme's theory of
configurations, for example,

00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:41.370
was almost unique in the 14th century.

00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:43.850
Significant, but modern historians find it

00:21:43.850 --> 00:21:47.390
as a step toward
anathematizing of explanation.

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:49.720
My point here is simply to underline

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:53.595
that events and objects understood
as unusual or miraculous

00:21:53.595 --> 00:21:56.430
tended to be analyzed
in the late Middle Ages

00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:58.540
as material changes.

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:02.363
To intellectuals, miracles
were a matter of matter.

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:05.610
Now, I cannot here give a survey

00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:07.107
of medieval conceptions of matter,

00:22:07.107 --> 00:22:09.010
and the problems they raised,

00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:11.780
but I want to say a few
words about the major texts

00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:15.000
philosophers and theologians drew on.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.210
I began with Isidore of Seville

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:20.388
whose etymological dictionary
provided basic definitions

00:22:20.388 --> 00:22:23.350
for the entire Middle Ages.

00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:25.490
Isidore says

00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:30.490
matter is always accepting
with regard to something,

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:34.660
hence we say the elements
are the matter of things

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:36.600
that are made from them.

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:39.880
Indeed, materia, matter,

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:42.280
is named from mater, mother.

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:44.750
It's perfectly easy to see that.

00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:48.450
Mater is in materia.

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:50.240
In its essence, therefore,

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:54.720
materia is fertile and
capable of becoming.

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:59.220
Moreover, discussing corpus,
body, and caro, flesh,

00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:02.600
Isidore says, quote, corpus
is called from the fact

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:06.610
that something being
corrupted, corruptum, perishes.

00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:09.567
Again, you see corpus is in corruptum,

00:23:10.608 --> 00:23:15.608
for it is soluble and mortal
and able to be dissolved.

00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:19.830
Caro, however, is called from creating.

00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:22.210
Corpus and caro signify differently.

00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:25.042
Body can be said of something
after life has departed,

00:23:25.042 --> 00:23:28.378
and of something that has been
brought forth without life,

00:23:28.378 --> 00:23:30.830
and sometimes there are
bodies without flesh,

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:34.260
as, for example, grass or tress, unquote.

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:38.740
Now the way such etymologizing
works in the Middle Ages

00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:41.130
is that the structure of
the word is the structure

00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:43.564
of the reality to which it refers,

00:23:43.564 --> 00:23:47.370
so if something is in the
word it's in the thing

00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:49.530
that's how this kind of thinking works,

00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:54.530
so if mater is in materia,
materia is maternal,

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:57.490
it is labile, fertile, percolating.

00:23:57.490 --> 00:24:01.420
If corrupt is in corpus

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:05.740
then this means that corpus
is that which changes,

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:07.920
so it's the nature of body and flesh

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:10.800
to be passing away and coming to be.

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:12.840
Moreover to Isidore as you can see here

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:15.130
corpus means something
closer to living thing,

00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:17.770
or even thing than to human being,

00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:20.110
so, you know, all this modern stuff about

00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:21.530
the body in the Middle Ages,

00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:25.003
but the putty in the Middle
Ages was Isidore's corpus,

00:24:25.003 --> 00:24:27.150
it was thing or living thing.

00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:29.740
It wasn't necessarily only,

00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:32.043
or even particularly the human body.

00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:37.780
This understanding of matter
and body that is of both

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:40.750
is by definition changing ontologically

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:45.393
as well as etymologically
change is in things itself

00:24:45.393 --> 00:24:47.880
is an understanding that operated

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:49.320
throughout the Middle Ages.

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:51.880
It's especially clear in
late medieval discussions

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:55.470
of alchemy, for example,
when Giles of Rome asked

00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:58.400
inequitable question of about 1,300

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:00.690
whether people can make gold?

00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:04.028
The possible arguments he
gives for the proposition

00:25:04.028 --> 00:25:07.474
include both the fact that
human beings can make glass,

00:25:07.474 --> 00:25:10.160
and the fact that pharaohs, magicians,

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:14.430
made servants from staves
are both natural processes.

00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:16.040
Giles then goes on to classify

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.670
different forms of generation.

00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:21.072
Horses from equine menstruum,

00:25:21.072 --> 00:25:25.270
bees from the decaying
carcasses of cattle,

00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:26.840
wine from grapes,

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:30.330
and gold from other
metals deep in the earth.

00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:31.310
The difference he says

00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:34.260
is the place and form of generation.

00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:37.040
They're all described by him as generatio.

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:40.330
The difference is they're
in different places,

00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:41.290
and have a different form,

00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:43.100
but it's the same ultimate process.

00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:45.470
Now what interests me
about this is the fact

00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:49.106
that what we would call normal
physiological production

00:25:49.106 --> 00:25:52.335
that is fetus from uterine material,

00:25:52.335 --> 00:25:56.090
what we would call spontaneous generation

00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:58.060
that is bees from decaying flesh,

00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:00.750
and what we would call
mechanical production

00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:04.680
that is glass from sand
or possible gold from lead

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:07.940
are treated as parallel cases
in this kind of discourse

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:10.190
as far as the production
of body is concerned,

00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:13.803
and that production is
conceptualized as generation.

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:16.740
This sense we find in Isidore,

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:18.470
and much later in Giles of Rome

00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:22.600
that matter is fertile,
maternal, labile, percolating,

00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:25.860
forever tossing up horses,
bees, glass or gold

00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:28.330
was enhanced in the high Middle Ages

00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:31.000
by the enormous influence of two works.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.240
The opening and closing books
of Ovid's Metamorphoses,

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:37.350
and Aristotle's essentially
biological model of change

00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:41.270
is his On Generation and Corruption.

00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:43.510
Following these ancients medieval thinkers

00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:46.029
assumed that at least
in the sublunar world

00:26:46.029 --> 00:26:50.340
to be was to be about to change.

00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:51.900
I give three examples.

00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:54.458
Bernard Silvestris, Nicole Oresme,

00:26:54.458 --> 00:26:57.133
and Niccolo Tignosi da Foligno.

00:26:58.287 --> 00:27:01.320
In the 12th century Bernard Silvestris's

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:05.040
magisterial allegorical
poem the Cosmographia

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:08.500
gave a very Ovidian account of creation.

00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:10.276
Indeed as Brian Stock remarks

00:27:10.276 --> 00:27:13.660
matter is the heroin of the Cosmographia

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:17.170
fighting death by perpetuating species.

00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:20.440
Sometimes, the chaos of
primitive and warring elements

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:22.050
longing to be reborn,

00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:24.461
sometimes, a more abstract substratum

00:27:24.461 --> 00:27:26.910
Bernard's matter draws from two

00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:29.582
rather different treatments in Ovid.

00:27:29.582 --> 00:27:33.523
It is both the rough and
teeming mass of Ovid's Book One,

00:27:33.523 --> 00:27:36.920
and the perduring, the lasting reality

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:41.570
of the more Pythagorean
account in Ovid's Book 15.

00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:44.100
What's especially important
about the Ovid reception

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:45.150
of the later Middle Ages

00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:46.990
of which Bernard's point is probably

00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:49.840
the single best example is the fact that

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:52.640
poets, natural philosophers,
and commentators

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:55.700
persistently emphasize
the two parts of Ovid

00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:59.510
that deal with matter and
change over the more moral,

00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:02.753
or immoral stories that come in between.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.050
In the later 13th and 14th centuries

00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:07.694
new conceptions of matter

00:28:07.694 --> 00:28:10.380
very different from the
teeming mass of Ovid,

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:12.530
or the maternal corpus of Isidore

00:28:12.530 --> 00:28:16.090
became commonplace among intellectuals.

00:28:16.090 --> 00:28:19.250
Change came to be understood
in line with Aristotle's

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:22.641
doctrine of contraries
that is the idea that

00:28:22.641 --> 00:28:25.700
material qualities come
to be and pass away

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:29.480
within a narrow range to
find by the contraries.

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:32.635
Both the principle of change
and the limitation of change

00:28:32.635 --> 00:28:35.220
Aristotle's matter is what accounts

00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:37.820
for going from one thing to another.

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:40.952
Caterpillar to butterfly, ice to water,

00:28:40.952 --> 00:28:44.410
whole log to cut wood.

00:28:44.410 --> 00:28:47.290
To Aristotle change is real

00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:49.420
because matter is not a thing itself.

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:51.540
Obviously, if a matter is thing itself

00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:53.850
it would endure and change
to be only superficial.

00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:56.210
Matter is not a thing itself to Aristotle,

00:28:56.210 --> 00:28:59.350
but because of potency
to be something else

00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:01.660
accounts for particular changes,

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:04.300
changes not inexplicable or arbitrary.

00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:07.640
A thing has a potency
to be some other things,

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:09.710
and not other things,

00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:12.830
hence Aristotelian
concepts rein in a sense

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:15.040
that change might be completely random

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:17.300
without making change only superficial

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:20.530
because there's something
there that endures.

00:29:20.530 --> 00:29:23.860
Nonetheless, understanding
change continued to be

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:28.320
a major metaphysical worry for
those who studied Aristotle.

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:30.100
Nicole Oresme, for example, pointed out

00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:31.420
that we cannot even think

00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:34.970
without the concept of transmutation.

00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:37.130
Commenting on the
generation and corruption

00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:39.590
around like a number of his contemporaries

00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:42.425
gave a strictly Aristotelian
theory of change

00:29:42.425 --> 00:29:45.947
making matter the potentiality to be not A

00:29:45.947 --> 00:29:50.947
that guarantees identity and
the change of A to not A.

00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:56.400
Oresme said, quote, we say
that the fact of contraries

00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:59.070
is the cause of corruption,

00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:01.460
and this is proved because all corruption

00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:04.710
is by the alteration of the previous.

00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:08.380
Therefore, it follows that
every thing having a contrary

00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:11.490
is at some time corrupted,

00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:15.400
and thus because the same thing
is the matter of contraries,

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:19.020
therefore, they succeed to
each other in the same matter,

00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:21.680
and thus matter which
is under one contrary

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:24.921
is in potency to this that it
can be under another contrary,

00:30:24.921 --> 00:30:27.450
which, unless it occurs, it would follow

00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:30.473
that this potency would
be frustrated, unquote.

00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:34.642
Now this kind of an interpretation
might seem to suggest

00:30:34.642 --> 00:30:37.350
that unlike Ovidian matter,

00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:39.987
Aristotle's matter has no characteristics.

00:30:39.987 --> 00:30:43.270
It would then be only that
which accounts for the fact

00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:46.090
that we can say we're
dealing with the same thing

00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:50.110
when a previous something
becomes a posterior something.

00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:52.862
All the essence, the definition,
the whatness of the thing

00:30:52.862 --> 00:30:55.250
will be accounted for by the form,

00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:57.830
but as Zoe Buzenberg has pointed out

00:30:57.830 --> 00:31:01.179
this is not really Oresme's understanding.

00:31:01.179 --> 00:31:05.580
Matter to Oresme is not empty potency.

00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:09.040
The use of the word frustrated
in the passage I just quoted

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:12.950
suggest, indeed, that matter
has a certain dynamic quality.

00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:16.300
It is characterized on
the one hand by privation,

00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:19.990
or lack, turpitudo, is Oresme's word

00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:22.458
which is a sort of desire for form,

00:31:22.458 --> 00:31:25.690
and on the other hand by a
tendency toward persisting,

00:31:25.690 --> 00:31:28.720
conatus, is Oresme's word.

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.209
Hence it would seem

00:31:30.209 --> 00:31:33.750
that even after the reception of Aristotle

00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:37.010
natural philosophers continued
to have a sense of matter

00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:41.140
as more labile and fertile
than Aristotelian text

00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:44.440
taken strictly would have suggested.

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:47.560
Indeed, many of those who used
and commented on Aristotle

00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:48.430
spoke as did Oresme

00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:52.580
of a kind of propensity
or yearning in matter.

00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:54.220
Albert the Great held, for example,

00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:56.674
that there was a confusion
in the heart of matter

00:31:56.674 --> 00:32:00.710
that could cooperate in the
generation of creatures.

00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:03.090
Although some Aristotelians rejected this

00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:06.124
a number of theorists such as
Bonaventure and Henry of Ghent

00:32:06.124 --> 00:32:08.660
continued to hold to a sort of autonomy,

00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:12.770
or actuality or desire in matter.

00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:16.730
In the 13th and 14th centuries
then even Aristotelian matter

00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:19.810
had certain affinities
with the percolating stuff

00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:23.320
of Ovid and Bernard Silvestris.

00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:27.070
Moreover, in the 15th century
Neo-Platonic interpretations

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:29.020
which had always accompanied Aristotle

00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:30.510
in the high Middle Ages

00:32:30.510 --> 00:32:31.970
contributed to the tendency

00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:34.790
to give the whole material world a labile,

00:32:34.790 --> 00:32:38.260
dynamic almost animate quality.

00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:40.740
Although the 12th century
reception of alchemy

00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:44.950
had doubted the possibility
of transmutation at all,

00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:46.850
there was resistance to alchemical text

00:32:46.850 --> 00:32:47.917
when they first came in.

00:32:47.917 --> 00:32:52.350
Later authors began to
understand all matter is animate.

00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:56.020
The development of the idea
of an alchemical quintessence

00:32:56.020 --> 00:32:58.080
led to theories of a vital stuff

00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:01.295
diffused throughout the cosmos.

00:33:01.295 --> 00:33:02.770
Marsilio Ficino, for example,

00:33:02.770 --> 00:33:06.100
related alchemical quintessence
to a spiritus mundi

00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:09.855
that is a soul or spirit of the universe.

00:33:09.855 --> 00:33:13.510
Using Neo-Platonic theories
intellectuals also debated

00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:16.579
the relationship of
heavenly bodies to Earth.

00:33:16.579 --> 00:33:18.810
It was after all clear that the heavens

00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:22.690
do influence earthly change and fertility.

00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:25.890
Tides correlate with
the phases of the moon.

00:33:25.890 --> 00:33:29.050
Seeds need sunshine to germinate.

00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:31.010
Tadpoles appear quite suddenly

00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:34.520
in apparently empty ponds after rain.

00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:37.870
Not all worldly change is
as obviously the production

00:33:37.870 --> 00:33:42.564
of like by like as is the
birth of puppies from dogs.

00:33:42.564 --> 00:33:44.950
I mean, you've got to
explain these things.

00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:48.039
Moreover, theories of astral determinism

00:33:48.039 --> 00:33:50.140
derived directly from the ancients,

00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:53.105
or from Neoplatonizing arid text

00:33:53.105 --> 00:33:56.320
contributed to a heightening
and anxious interest

00:33:56.320 --> 00:34:00.100
in the role of the heavens
in worldly affairs,

00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:03.310
hence philosophers asked
whether earthly changes occurred

00:34:03.310 --> 00:34:05.700
through the induction or eduction of forms

00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:07.563
by celestial intelligences,

00:34:07.563 --> 00:34:10.640
that is through a process
whereby these intelligences

00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:12.380
impregnated matter with forms,

00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:14.170
or drew forms out from matter,

00:34:14.170 --> 00:34:17.223
and queried whether something
like a Platonic idea

00:34:17.223 --> 00:34:21.840
was a necessary intermediary
in this process.

00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:25.780
Two treatises on Platonic
ideas attributed to a certain,

00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:28.200
Niccolo Tignosi da Foligno,

00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:30.040
who was a physician and teacher

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:34.520
of both logic and medicine at
Florence provide an example.

00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:37.380
At issue was whether
things generated in cases

00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:39.564
where like does not produce like

00:34:39.564 --> 00:34:42.304
are generated by the
heavens acting directly,

00:34:42.304 --> 00:34:45.850
or involve the Platonic ideas.

00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:48.730
The examples given in
both Niccolo's treatises

00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:51.320
are the birth of a mass from putrefaction,

00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:52.940
and the generation of fire

00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:56.250
by striking stone and iron together.

00:34:56.250 --> 00:34:58.640
I mean, already striking
that these two processes

00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:01.310
are taken as analogous.

00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:03.918
Now I'm not concerned here with Niccolo's

00:35:03.918 --> 00:35:08.020
abstruse discussion of astral influence.

00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:09.500
What interests me are two points.

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:13.120
His queries about and his
definitions of change.

00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:15.540
Now listen to what these
passages are going to say.

00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:17.285
First, we have to note his assumption

00:35:17.285 --> 00:35:20.422
that a wide variety of
changes are parallel,

00:35:20.422 --> 00:35:24.640
and can be explained as
form acting on matter.

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:27.240
As I just said there's no
theoretical difference for him

00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:29.828
between the production of fire from flint,

00:35:29.828 --> 00:35:34.200
and the birth of an animal
from slime both are generation.

00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:36.170
What needs explaining is the emergence

00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:40.460
of not like from like and
how the stars produce it.

00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:42.890
Second, we should note
the actual definitions

00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:44.800
of matter at play here.

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:47.170
Attempting to sort out the
very complicated issues

00:35:47.170 --> 00:35:50.773
raised along the way the author concludes.

00:35:51.882 --> 00:35:55.310
If anyone wants to interpret
rightly the statement

00:35:55.310 --> 00:35:58.010
form is educed from the potency of matter,

00:35:58.010 --> 00:35:59.838
other than it is commonly understood,

00:35:59.838 --> 00:36:04.710
he must say that matter is
subsumed under three headings.

00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:07.720
First, for that which is pure potency,

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:11.228
which is the non-existent
part of a natural thing.

00:36:11.228 --> 00:36:13.759
Second, for a thing which is opposite,

00:36:13.759 --> 00:36:16.210
that is for that from
which something is made

00:36:16.210 --> 00:36:18.930
so that that from which it
is made is not non-existent,

00:36:18.930 --> 00:36:21.935
as, for example, fire is made from air,

00:36:21.935 --> 00:36:26.935
and third for a natural agent, unquote.

00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:30.736
In the ensuing explanation
the second meaning of matter

00:36:30.736 --> 00:36:32.980
is the four elements.

00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:36.790
The third refers to that
from which the form is made

00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:40.700
in the process of generation
and Niccolo says, quote,

00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:43.650
so that the substantial
form which is generated

00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:46.340
is educed from the potency of matter,

00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:49.737
that is, from the active
potential of the material agent,

00:36:49.737 --> 00:36:53.070
and by this material agent I understand,

00:36:53.070 --> 00:36:55.040
in the way of the theologians,

00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:59.410
every agent which includes
in itself imperfection,

00:36:59.410 --> 00:37:03.270
which are all agents
except the first, God.

00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:06.030
So you see what's
happened to matter, right?

00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:07.310
Matter has three meanings.

00:37:07.310 --> 00:37:09.500
First it's the pure
potency that you might say

00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:13.530
is in the strict sense
Aristotelian matter.

00:37:13.530 --> 00:37:16.070
Second, it is that from
which something is made,

00:37:16.070 --> 00:37:18.100
and third is its natural agent

00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:21.895
all these things are materia, matter.

00:37:21.895 --> 00:37:25.270
Niccolo understands
matter not only as stuff

00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:26.970
rather than a simple potentiality,

00:37:26.970 --> 00:37:28.890
but also as dynamic stuff.

00:37:28.890 --> 00:37:31.017
Indeed, matter is all
the stuff of creation,

00:37:31.017 --> 00:37:33.270
forever in motion exactly

00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:37.380
because imperfect in contrast
to the perfection of God,

00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:39.500
so by this point the whole universe

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:42.980
has become materia in a sense.

00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:45.930
Now this understanding of
matter is in some sense dynamic

00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:48.502
as possessing power or desire within it

00:37:48.502 --> 00:37:50.637
does not run in a straight line

00:37:50.637 --> 00:37:53.370
from the Neo-Platonic and Ovidian writings

00:37:53.370 --> 00:37:56.510
of Bernard Silvestris and his
12th century contemporaries

00:37:56.510 --> 00:38:01.110
to 15th century figures
like Tignosi and Ficino.

00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:03.304
The 13th century recovery of Aristotle

00:38:03.304 --> 00:38:05.350
did make a difference,

00:38:05.350 --> 00:38:09.140
and as I suggested Aristotle's
matter is not a substance,

00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:11.500
hence it's less labile in itself

00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:14.919
than the matter of 12th
or 15th century theorists.

00:38:14.919 --> 00:38:18.560
Moreover, 14th century
scholastics such as Oresme

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:20.350
were less concerned with matter per se

00:38:20.350 --> 00:38:22.805
than was, for example, Bernard Silvestris.

00:38:22.805 --> 00:38:25.691
They were suspicious of
ideas of animate matter

00:38:25.691 --> 00:38:28.264
whether alchemical or cosmological,

00:38:28.264 --> 00:38:31.362
although, change especially
in the form of local motion

00:38:31.362 --> 00:38:34.268
remained a pressing question for them.

00:38:34.268 --> 00:38:37.410
The theories of matter we
find in natural philosophy

00:38:37.410 --> 00:38:39.970
from the 12th to the 16th
century are not all the same,

00:38:39.970 --> 00:38:42.950
nor they do show a continuous development

00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:44.140
from the world soul

00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:46.564
of some 12th century commentators on Plato

00:38:46.564 --> 00:38:49.531
to Ficino's soul of the universe.

00:38:49.531 --> 00:38:51.660
Nonetheless, even the theorists

00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:53.300
of the 13th and 14th centuries

00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:55.718
who opposed the possibility
of living stars,

00:38:55.718 --> 00:38:57.735
or alchemical manipulation

00:38:57.735 --> 00:39:00.792
tended to assume almost
in spite of themselves

00:39:00.792 --> 00:39:04.673
a basic dynamism lurking in men.

00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:07.575
Now this kind of understanding of matter

00:39:07.575 --> 00:39:11.730
I've taken you on a brief
tour through the Middle Ages,

00:39:11.730 --> 00:39:13.700
but I think if we're
gonna talk about theories

00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:16.930
you have to understand
the theories and the base.

00:39:16.930 --> 00:39:18.870
This understanding of materiality

00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:22.092
was theologically speaking a problem.

00:39:22.092 --> 00:39:26.040
If matter was by definition
the great roiling mass

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:27.560
of Ovid's Metamorphoses,

00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:32.520
or even the active potential
of Foligno's material agent

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:36.650
then the eruption of the
sacred in Dauerwunder,

00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:41.650
for example, or in animated
statues was easy to envision.

00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:45.264
Its continuing presence,
its stasis or endurance

00:39:45.264 --> 00:39:48.330
became difficult of explanation, however.

00:39:48.330 --> 00:39:49.842
If things were always coming to be

00:39:49.842 --> 00:39:53.640
were they not also always passing away?

00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:57.290
To Isidore, after all, corpus
was related etymologically,

00:39:57.290 --> 00:40:00.730
and thus ontologically to corruptum,

00:40:00.730 --> 00:40:04.090
that's what it is to be a thing,

00:40:04.090 --> 00:40:07.700
and was not such passing
on such corrupsio a threat

00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:09.300
if it touched the divine.

00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:10.670
Remember talking about miracles

00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:14.060
where the divine appears in matter.

00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:16.910
In the controversy over the
miracle host at Wilsnack,

00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:20.150
for example, there were
theorists such as James of Klusa

00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:24.340
who claimed not only that
the deteriorated stuff

00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:27.610
revered in the 1450s could not be sacred

00:40:27.610 --> 00:40:29.510
because it had decayed,

00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:32.070
but also that if it later decayed

00:40:32.070 --> 00:40:35.760
it could not have been
holy in the first place,

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:40.280
so when it appeared in 1383 looking back,

00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:41.830
you know, retrospectively you say

00:40:41.830 --> 00:40:43.220
it couldn't have been holy then

00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:47.070
because now it has
decayed God cannot change.

00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:49.181
His body does not appear and disappear,

00:40:49.181 --> 00:40:51.820
so clearly the fact that sacred things

00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:54.130
pass away was a problem,

00:40:54.130 --> 00:40:56.195
but even coming to be was a problem.

00:40:56.195 --> 00:40:58.750
Materiality needed to be controlled,

00:40:58.750 --> 00:41:01.960
conceptually and ecclesiastically.

00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:03.960
Neither church authorities and theologians

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:06.250
nor natural philosophers
could tolerate a world

00:41:06.250 --> 00:41:08.143
in which anything might erupt anywhere,

00:41:08.143 --> 00:41:11.430
hence they devised
theories that controlled

00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:15.664
that has limited miraculous
change in a variety of ways.

00:41:15.664 --> 00:41:18.370
They did this sometimes by reducing it

00:41:18.370 --> 00:41:21.110
to mere appearance of transformation,

00:41:21.110 --> 00:41:22.567
sometimes by admitting it,

00:41:22.567 --> 00:41:24.960
but hedging it about with explanations

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:28.540
that involved as little change as possible

00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:31.650
is to this point the efforts
of theorists to rein in

00:41:31.650 --> 00:41:34.530
the miraculous without
denying it that I now turn,

00:41:34.530 --> 00:41:39.130
this is part 4B here on the outline.

00:41:39.130 --> 00:41:41.330
So I'm not arguing that here these guys

00:41:41.330 --> 00:41:43.450
they're just naturalizing miracles.

00:41:43.450 --> 00:41:45.370
If they were that wouldn't
be all that interesting,

00:41:45.370 --> 00:41:48.300
you know, I mean, once
Hume says it he said it,

00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:50.410
but what's interesting is that they can't

00:41:50.410 --> 00:41:52.340
naturalize miracles completely,

00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:54.750
but look what they're doing
in order to rein them in

00:41:54.750 --> 00:41:58.220
in all kinds of ways
short of simply denying,

00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:00.060
or naturalizing them.

00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:02.260
A number of theologians
held that Dauerwunder

00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:06.850
were not real change of
accidents that is appearance.

00:42:06.850 --> 00:42:08.960
The real change in the
Christian Eucharist was,

00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:11.740
of course, the substantial
change of bread to flesh,

00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:13.770
but this was invisible.

00:42:13.770 --> 00:42:15.670
Indeed, it was part of the definition

00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:19.690
of transubstantiation that
accidents do not change.

00:42:19.690 --> 00:42:23.010
Hence most theologians
held that if an individual,

00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:27.510
or a group saw a host or
communion chalice change to blood

00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:28.733
they were not seeing

00:42:28.733 --> 00:42:31.084
the substance of Christ in the Eucharist,

00:42:31.084 --> 00:42:34.920
but an effect produced by
God in their imaginations.

00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:36.240
So the theorists are in a way

00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:38.900
substituting one kind
of miracle for another,

00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:42.840
but you cannot see God
in transubstantiation

00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:45.170
because it sits under the
definition of transubstantiation

00:42:45.170 --> 00:42:46.890
that you can't see the substance,

00:42:46.890 --> 00:42:49.110
and the accidents don't change.

00:42:49.110 --> 00:42:50.440
Dauerwunder might be miracles,

00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:52.490
but they were not miracles of seeing God.

00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:55.010
Building on theories that went back

00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:56.210
to Augustine of Hippo,

00:42:56.210 --> 00:42:59.140
theologians by and large
made similar arguments about

00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:00.860
the bodily metamorphoses

00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:03.148
that so fascinated late medieval people,

00:43:03.148 --> 00:43:05.014
the change of humans into animals,

00:43:05.014 --> 00:43:08.041
or werewolves supposedly
caused by witches, demons,

00:43:08.041 --> 00:43:10.780
heredity, sin, or the moon.

00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:13.590
For example, Heinrich
Kramer, in the notorious

00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:17.699
Malleus Maleficarum, the
Hammer of Witches of 1486

00:43:17.699 --> 00:43:20.960
argued that witches could make men believe

00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:23.886
they had lost their genitals
by hiding them from view,

00:43:23.886 --> 00:43:28.340
or act on the senses and the
imagination to delude people

00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:31.350
into quote, unquote, thinking
they see marvelous things

00:43:31.350 --> 00:43:33.450
such as beasts or other horrors,

00:43:33.450 --> 00:43:35.790
when in actual fact they see nothing,

00:43:35.790 --> 00:43:37.930
but witches cannot in a strict sense

00:43:37.930 --> 00:43:39.897
turn people into beasts,

00:43:39.897 --> 00:43:43.650
thus some intellectuals between
the 13th and 15th centuries

00:43:43.650 --> 00:43:46.250
dealt with the supposed
miraculous miracle,

00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:48.463
magical or marvelous changes

00:43:48.463 --> 00:43:51.114
by claiming them to be the mere appearance

00:43:51.114 --> 00:43:54.326
of transformation or
one kind of appearance,

00:43:54.326 --> 00:43:56.550
and another sort of miracle,

00:43:56.550 --> 00:43:59.120
but theologians and natural philosophers

00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:02.170
also limited or naturalized
the physical changes

00:44:02.170 --> 00:44:04.600
involved in miracle.

00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:06.430
We see this in two moves

00:44:06.430 --> 00:44:10.710
first explaining physical
change by internal mechanisms

00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:12.890
even if they're used supernaturally,

00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:15.350
so you keep some kind
of supernatural element,

00:44:15.350 --> 00:44:17.800
but you actually come up
with a natural explanation

00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:20.730
for the change even if it
takes God to trigger it.

00:44:20.730 --> 00:44:23.510
Second, explaining bodily
occurrences even in

00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:27.423
Christ's body by natural
physiological processes.

00:44:28.410 --> 00:44:31.638
The first move made use from
the 12th to the 14th centuries

00:44:31.638 --> 00:44:34.940
of an idea inherited
from Augustine of Hippo

00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:37.780
that felt particularly
well with an Ovidian sense

00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:40.990
of nature as a percolating mass of forms.

00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:44.170
This was the idea of seminal reasons.

00:44:44.170 --> 00:44:47.030
Seeds of later things or incipient forms,

00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:51.640
or patterns of development
implanted by God at creation.

00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:54.030
The idea that bodies bore
seeds of other bodies

00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:55.870
they might generate or become

00:44:55.870 --> 00:44:58.852
was used by a number of
intellectuals to explain miracles,

00:44:58.852 --> 00:45:03.140
or elucidate doctrine such
as transubstantiation.

00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:05.900
It was an idea that closely
controlled the nature,

00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:08.220
and direction of change without as I said

00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:11.050
naturalizing the miraculous completely.

00:45:11.050 --> 00:45:12.730
In the 12th century, for example,

00:45:12.730 --> 00:45:15.030
both John of Salisbury and Rupert of Deutz

00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:17.220
explained the miracle at Cana,

00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:19.870
thus that is the change
of water into wine.

00:45:19.870 --> 00:45:22.810
There are seminal reasons
in things that unfold

00:45:22.810 --> 00:45:24.810
in preordained time.

00:45:24.810 --> 00:45:28.680
Trees draw up water into
grapes and make wine.

00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:31.600
If God speeds this up
and turns water into wine

00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:34.950
without the intervening
steps we call it a miracle.

00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:37.264
In a way you've got a natural explanation

00:45:37.264 --> 00:45:40.791
the divine element is the speed up.

00:45:40.791 --> 00:45:44.650
Theories of similar reasons
lasted into the 14th century,

00:45:44.650 --> 00:45:46.010
but there were other concepts

00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:49.100
that could be used to limit change.

00:45:49.100 --> 00:45:51.980
Hugh of Saint Victor seems
to have had a theory of atoms

00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:54.564
that explained the production
of Eve from Adam's rib,

00:45:54.564 --> 00:45:57.291
and as I said earlier
Nicholas of Autrecourt

00:45:57.291 --> 00:46:00.030
explained resurrection atomically

00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:03.410
by that vaporization and recondensation.

00:46:03.410 --> 00:46:05.864
Roger Bacon gave an
analysis of resurrection

00:46:05.864 --> 00:46:09.010
as the reduction of body to prime matter,

00:46:09.010 --> 00:46:12.290
and the induction of the same form again.

00:46:12.290 --> 00:46:14.510
Although not denying the miraculous nature

00:46:14.510 --> 00:46:16.130
of the event entirely

00:46:16.130 --> 00:46:19.570
this discussion analyzes it
in terms of a natural process

00:46:19.570 --> 00:46:23.023
like that debated by
contemporary alchemists.

00:46:23.023 --> 00:46:26.360
Oresme commenting in the
Generation and Corruption

00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:29.027
naturalized the effects of the Eucharist,

00:46:29.027 --> 00:46:31.780
but not the Eucharist itself arguing

00:46:31.780 --> 00:46:33.880
it is a miracle that accidents

00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:35.760
are present without a subject,

00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:38.290
but not, however, a miracle
that these accidents

00:46:38.290 --> 00:46:40.850
act on other accidents or substances

00:46:40.850 --> 00:46:44.637
hence the Eucharist can
feed those who eat it.

00:46:44.637 --> 00:46:48.295
In addition to such models
as some of the reasons

00:46:48.295 --> 00:46:51.960
atoms, configurations that
can be employed to explain

00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:54.230
extraordinary or miraculous change

00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:56.070
a number of late medieval theologians,

00:46:56.070 --> 00:46:58.904
and natural philosophers
used physiological theories

00:46:58.904 --> 00:47:02.358
such as the traditional
Galenic idea of the humors

00:47:02.358 --> 00:47:06.260
to categorize anomalous bodily events.

00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:08.270
Around 1300 there was, for example,

00:47:08.270 --> 00:47:10.380
discussion of whether the bloody sweat

00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:12.830
Christ shed on the Mount of Olives

00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:16.140
was naturally or supernaturally produced,

00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:17.767
and whether his death on the cross

00:47:17.767 --> 00:47:22.230
was a result of bleeding
or an act of his will.

00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:25.190
15th century debates about
the relics of Christ's blood

00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:28.306
at places such as Westminster,
Weingarten La Rochelle,

00:47:28.306 --> 00:47:30.570
entailed determining whether the blood

00:47:30.570 --> 00:47:32.130
Christ shed on Golgotha

00:47:32.130 --> 00:47:35.459
was superficial nutritional
blood generated from food,

00:47:35.459 --> 00:47:38.700
or the blood of the so-called
core of human nature.

00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:40.460
You'll probably be glad
I'm not gonna explain

00:47:40.460 --> 00:47:42.162
these debates in detail,

00:47:42.162 --> 00:47:44.830
but the interesting thing
is that scientific theories

00:47:44.830 --> 00:47:48.310
are being employed not as I
say to completely naturalize,

00:47:48.310 --> 00:47:51.054
but to go a long way towards naturalizing,

00:47:51.054 --> 00:47:54.370
so that you can understand
scientifically the process

00:47:54.370 --> 00:47:57.160
that's going on even as I
say if God has to trigger it.

00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:58.720
They did similar very interesting

00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:00.580
sort of discussions with stigmata,

00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:03.810
which come close to some kind of

00:48:03.810 --> 00:48:06.723
maybe even modern sort of
psychological understandings

00:48:06.723 --> 00:48:09.350
because they talked
about how the imagination

00:48:09.350 --> 00:48:12.877
between the upper and lower
elements of the intellect,

00:48:12.877 --> 00:48:15.628
and the body God would
have to cooperate with it

00:48:15.628 --> 00:48:19.229
in order to produce physiological effects.

00:48:19.229 --> 00:48:21.840
In order to give you one
more detailed example

00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:24.630
of how medieval intellectuals
use theories of matter

00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:26.767
to limit without denying miraculous change

00:48:26.767 --> 00:48:28.740
I turn to an example,

00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:30.020
and I'll talk about a little bit more,

00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:31.660
and this is my last example.

00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:33.530
This is Jan Hus's two treatises

00:48:33.530 --> 00:48:36.313
on Christ's blood from 1406 to '07.

00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:40.750
Treatises that were produced
for the Ecclesiastic Commission

00:48:40.750 --> 00:48:42.990
appointed in Prague to
look into the claims

00:48:42.990 --> 00:48:44.860
of the Wilsnack miracle.

00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:49.667
Here just incidentally is the
Wilsnack church as it today,

00:48:49.667 --> 00:48:53.372
and the chest where these
miracle hosts were kept

00:48:53.372 --> 00:48:57.130
in the 15th and early 16th centuries

00:48:57.130 --> 00:49:00.363
before the actual miracle was destroyed.

00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:05.660
Hus dismissed effluvial relics
such as the holy foreskin,

00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:06.882
and the blood of Christ

00:49:06.882 --> 00:49:10.890
laboring them near visible
signs for the faithless.

00:49:10.890 --> 00:49:14.480
He rejected as fraudulent
transformation miracles

00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:16.810
that were associated
with the Wilsnack host.

00:49:16.810 --> 00:49:19.920
It supposedly had produced
resurrections from the dead.

00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:22.850
It had turned staves into
swords, and vice versa,

00:49:22.850 --> 00:49:25.460
this kind of thing he rejected all this.

00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:28.540
He suggested that preserving
supposed blood relics,

00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:31.190
and host miracles was akin to, quote,

00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:34.370
venerating horse's blood smeared on wafers

00:49:34.370 --> 00:49:37.040
by lying priests, unquote.

00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:40.858
To revere such bits of
matter was to denigrate God,

00:49:40.858 --> 00:49:44.426
yet Hus admitted the
absolute power of God,

00:49:44.426 --> 00:49:47.310
and that it could cause Christ's blood

00:49:47.310 --> 00:49:49.390
to remain behind on earth.

00:49:49.390 --> 00:49:52.100
By the theory of Concomitance
that is the theory that

00:49:52.100 --> 00:49:55.110
part is whole Christ's
blood is wholly present

00:49:55.110 --> 00:49:57.420
in every celebration of the Eucharist,

00:49:57.420 --> 00:50:02.160
hence it could be on earth as
well as in heaven in glory.

00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:05.650
Hus employed technical
Aristotelian terminology,

00:50:05.650 --> 00:50:08.250
and natural philosophical analogies

00:50:08.250 --> 00:50:10.687
to explain the possibility
both of blood relics,

00:50:10.687 --> 00:50:13.768
and of another singularly
unnatural occurrence

00:50:13.768 --> 00:50:16.713
the resurrection of the
body at the end of time.

00:50:17.900 --> 00:50:22.300
Apropos blood relics Hus asserts
that redness might remain

00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:24.907
on tunic that is Christ's tunic,

00:50:24.907 --> 00:50:28.490
or the sweat cloth or on
the bread of the Eucharist

00:50:28.490 --> 00:50:31.080
apart from the substance of Christ's blood

00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:33.500
just as accidents remain in the Eucharist

00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:35.020
when the substance changes,

00:50:35.020 --> 00:50:37.526
so it's a kind of
transubstantiation but in reverse.

00:50:37.526 --> 00:50:39.861
In transubstantiation
the substance changes,

00:50:39.861 --> 00:50:42.510
but the accidents stay bread and wine.

00:50:42.510 --> 00:50:44.838
Here the idea would be that
the accidents of the blood

00:50:44.838 --> 00:50:47.010
can appear on the miraculous objects,

00:50:47.010 --> 00:50:48.990
but the substance of
Christ's blood is not there

00:50:48.990 --> 00:50:51.526
because it's in heaven,

00:50:51.526 --> 00:50:53.810
so this is a possible explanation.

00:50:53.810 --> 00:50:56.810
He insists, however, that if
this kind of redness appears

00:50:56.810 --> 00:51:00.800
the redness would be a
miracle caused by God,

00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:04.820
but only, quote, unquote,
left in memoriam, unquote.

00:51:04.820 --> 00:51:05.653
In other words,

00:51:05.653 --> 00:51:07.847
he has to admit the
possibility of blood relics,

00:51:07.847 --> 00:51:11.409
but he uses technical
substance accident language

00:51:11.409 --> 00:51:13.264
both to explain the possibility,

00:51:13.264 --> 00:51:15.729
and to claim that the present redness

00:51:15.729 --> 00:51:18.320
even if created or permitted by God

00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:21.190
is not the substance of Christ.

00:51:21.190 --> 00:51:24.950
Apropos the blood of Christ's
circumcision, Hus writes,

00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:28.195
quote, and it is possible
that the blood of Christ,

00:51:28.195 --> 00:51:32.000
which flowed out from his
body in the circumcision,

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.530
was substantially converted
into something else

00:51:34.530 --> 00:51:36.140
according to form,

00:51:36.140 --> 00:51:38.530
or that the blood if
drained out on the cross,

00:51:38.530 --> 00:51:41.450
and converted to vapor
by the heat of the sun

00:51:41.450 --> 00:51:43.140
reverted then by his power

00:51:43.140 --> 00:51:45.770
on the day of resurrection
to its proper form,

00:51:45.770 --> 00:51:49.781
and this was the same
blood in number as in form,

00:51:49.781 --> 00:51:52.210
nor should the faithful fear that

00:51:52.210 --> 00:51:54.010
they will not receive again their bodies

00:51:54.010 --> 00:51:55.622
because wild animals have eaten them

00:51:55.622 --> 00:52:00.380
for in the resurrection all
will be gloried, unquote.

00:52:00.380 --> 00:52:03.250
Now there are a lot of interesting
things in that passage.

00:52:03.250 --> 00:52:07.940
We see Hus using Thomistic
notions of formal identity,

00:52:07.940 --> 00:52:10.650
how something can be
the same thing over time

00:52:10.650 --> 00:52:13.550
because the form is the same
as the philosophical argument,

00:52:13.550 --> 00:52:16.865
and natural philosophical
understandings of vaporization

00:52:16.865 --> 00:52:19.819
to render the miracle
of bodily resurrection

00:52:19.819 --> 00:52:23.881
as credible as possible
logically and scientifically

00:52:23.881 --> 00:52:26.740
because form carries what a thing is,

00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:28.739
the return of substantial form to matter,

00:52:28.739 --> 00:52:31.436
which has in the meantime
had another substantial form

00:52:31.436 --> 00:52:35.410
can make the entity the
same thing it was before.

00:52:35.410 --> 00:52:37.280
Things converted to gas or vapor

00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:39.710
by the sun can recondense,

00:52:39.710 --> 00:52:42.240
so philosophical argument,
scientific argument,

00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:45.430
hence even the blood shed
in crucifixion days before,

00:52:45.430 --> 00:52:49.810
or in the circumcision years
before, 32 years before

00:52:49.810 --> 00:52:52.450
can be reassembled for resurrection

00:52:52.450 --> 00:52:55.280
just as moisture returns out of the air,

00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:57.272
and at a technical sense
it will be the same

00:52:57.272 --> 00:53:00.378
salvific blood of Christ.

00:53:00.378 --> 00:53:02.500
Now, Hus's point is not,

00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:04.532
of course, to limit material change,

00:53:04.532 --> 00:53:08.430
or to rein in the miraculous per se.

00:53:08.430 --> 00:53:12.660
To him the devotional and
theological agenda is paramount.

00:53:12.660 --> 00:53:16.070
What he wants to restrain is false piety.

00:53:16.070 --> 00:53:19.360
What he asserts most passionately
is the soteriological

00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:22.440
significance of the
resurrection of the dead.

00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:25.830
He uses the natural
analogy of vaporization

00:53:25.830 --> 00:53:28.760
to assert that all Christ
blood rose with Christ

00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:30.510
because he wants to limit pilgrimage

00:53:30.510 --> 00:53:32.680
to blood relics and Dauerwunder.

00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:35.480
He uses Thomistic language
of form and substance

00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:38.222
because to him the return
of bodies at the end of time

00:53:38.222 --> 00:53:42.730
is central to the Christian
hope for personal salvation.

00:53:42.730 --> 00:53:46.050
His argument constrains one
kind of miraculous change,

00:53:46.050 --> 00:53:48.415
the eruption of blood on sacred objects,

00:53:48.415 --> 00:53:50.250
but supports another,

00:53:50.250 --> 00:53:53.280
the resurrection of every bodily particle.

00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:55.958
Moreover, he employs the
language of formal identity

00:53:55.958 --> 00:53:59.782
to bolster faith in God's power
to do the truly astonishing,

00:53:59.782 --> 00:54:01.810
raise the dead, although,

00:54:01.810 --> 00:54:05.500
he denies that God did so at Wilsnack.

00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:08.231
Using metaphysical and
scientific language,

00:54:08.231 --> 00:54:11.228
Hus restricts certain
kinds of miraculous change

00:54:11.228 --> 00:54:13.020
while supporting others.

00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:16.370
He demystifies, makes
intellectually accessible,

00:54:16.370 --> 00:54:19.774
even naturalizes certain
aspects of holy matter.

00:54:19.774 --> 00:54:23.260
What he does not do is
either deny God's power

00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:27.225
to transform matter or leave
it without explanation,

00:54:27.225 --> 00:54:32.225
and I argue this is a typical
14th and 15th century move.

00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:35.740
Now I could give many more examples

00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:39.560
of such types of
argumentation, but I won't.

00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:42.740
I hope I've now demonstrated
that behind the discussion

00:54:42.740 --> 00:54:45.160
of university theologians,
devotional writers,

00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:47.289
and natural philosophers about miracles

00:54:47.289 --> 00:54:52.289
lay a quite ambivalent
fascination with material change

00:54:52.370 --> 00:54:55.400
that coincides with the
contemporary proliferation

00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:58.260
of transformed images,
relics and Dauerwunder,

00:54:58.260 --> 00:55:00.563
and the increasing anxiety about them.

00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:02.994
Chronology is important,

00:55:02.994 --> 00:55:05.650
although, for such changes in attitude

00:55:05.650 --> 00:55:08.120
it is necessarily not very precise.

00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:09.530
People don't wake up one morning,

00:55:09.530 --> 00:55:10.550
and have different attitudes

00:55:10.550 --> 00:55:13.490
from those they had the day before.

00:55:13.490 --> 00:55:15.530
Nonetheless, I must underline that it is

00:55:15.530 --> 00:55:18.520
in the 14th and 15th
centuries when Dauerwunder,

00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:21.360
and other transformation
miracles proliferated

00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:24.177
accompanied by theological
efforts to deal with them

00:55:24.177 --> 00:55:27.518
that we find a shift in
other sorts of theorizing,

00:55:27.518 --> 00:55:30.556
whereas, in the 12th and
early 13th centuries,

00:55:30.556 --> 00:55:33.300
the newly received alchemical texts

00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:34.570
were accompanied by glosses

00:55:34.570 --> 00:55:37.100
that suggested that
alchemy was not possible,

00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:39.420
that species were enviable.

00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:42.490
By the 14th and 15th century
there was growing confidence

00:55:42.490 --> 00:55:44.720
that species could be transmuted,

00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:48.690
gold could be made if only the
correct formula were found.

00:55:48.690 --> 00:55:50.880
12th century ideas of a world soul,

00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:53.311
or of matter as Ovidian fecundity

00:55:53.311 --> 00:55:56.560
were succeeded in the late
13th and 14th centuries

00:55:56.560 --> 00:55:59.803
by a more Aristotelian
focus on locomotion,

00:55:59.803 --> 00:56:03.000
and opposition to ideas
of a living heaven,

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:04.900
but these were followed
in the 15th century

00:56:04.900 --> 00:56:07.025
by the return of Neo-Platonic ideas

00:56:07.025 --> 00:56:09.610
of the soul of the universe.

00:56:09.610 --> 00:56:11.390
12th century stories of werewolves,

00:56:11.390 --> 00:56:13.090
and other bodily transformations,

00:56:13.090 --> 00:56:15.780
although, very popular
insisted that such changes

00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:18.820
were basically only apparent.

00:56:18.820 --> 00:56:21.620
By the later 15th century
some theorists tended

00:56:21.620 --> 00:56:24.040
that people really became wolves.

00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:26.680
There continued to be
resistance to the idea that

00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:29.270
witches actually turned
people into beasts,

00:56:29.270 --> 00:56:30.750
or snatch away their body parts,

00:56:30.750 --> 00:56:32.700
but they were increasingly persecuted

00:56:32.700 --> 00:56:35.918
for creating widespread
illusions of change.

00:56:35.918 --> 00:56:38.581
Some among them and
among their persecutors

00:56:38.581 --> 00:56:42.398
did believe they could
cause such metamorphoses.

00:56:42.398 --> 00:56:45.800
By the later Middle Ages
astrology flourished,

00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:48.540
and intellectuals devoted
a great deal of discussion

00:56:48.540 --> 00:56:50.102
not only to ways in which the stars

00:56:50.102 --> 00:56:51.750
controlled earthly events,

00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:55.460
but also to material changes
they caused here below

00:56:55.460 --> 00:56:59.200
such as the birth of
hermaphrodites and monsters.

00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:00.260
In conclusion then

00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:06.440
the end, in conclusion
I'm arguing that claims to

00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:09.863
miraculous transformation
increased in the later Middle Ages

00:57:09.863 --> 00:57:13.870
as did suspicion and rejection of them,

00:57:13.870 --> 00:57:16.460
and that medieval natural
philosophy provided

00:57:16.460 --> 00:57:18.810
both a sense that matter is that

00:57:18.810 --> 00:57:20.850
in which radical change erupts,

00:57:20.850 --> 00:57:23.870
and a set of conceptual
tools for containing

00:57:23.870 --> 00:57:27.960
if not naturalizing
completely such eruptions.

00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:30.680
I would also suggest
that these developments

00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:33.778
of this complicated kind of contradiction

00:57:33.778 --> 00:57:36.900
foreshadow and in some ways lead into

00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:40.354
the 16th century religious
upheavals we call reformations,

00:57:40.354 --> 00:57:43.098
but to discuss that would
be to give another lecture.

00:57:43.098 --> 00:57:43.965
Thank you.

00:57:43.965 --> 00:57:46.919
(applause)

00:57:46.919 --> 00:57:49.336
(soft music)
