DAVID RIPHAGEN:
Welcome, and thank you

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.910
for joining our breakout
session on playing fair.

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:05.800
I'm David.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.160
I'm a product manager
with Google Play Commerce.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.040
I'm responsible for user trust.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.230
And the last year,
Jonathan and I

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.030
have been working
together closely

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.740
with a lot of
developers thinking

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.210
about how we would create a
more fair and balanced platform

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.060
for your apps and your games.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.230
JOHN MCGUIRE: Thanks, David.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.080
Hi, everyone.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.770
My name is John McGuire, and I'm
a partner development manager

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.180
here at Google Play.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.189
And David and I are really
excited to come talk

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.772
to you about the
ways that we can make

00:00:33.772 --> 00:00:36.310
developing for Android better.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.640
So we titled this
talk Playing Fair.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.590
And part of this
means maintaining

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.300
a fair in-game
economy in your games

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.630
so you can build sustainable,
long-term businesses

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:46.830
on our platform.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.306
So that's the
general topic of what

00:00:48.306 --> 00:00:49.430
we're going to cover today.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.650
So now I'll go into the agenda.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.960
So briefly, I'm going to
talk about what playing

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.727
fair means for Google Play.

00:00:59.727 --> 00:01:01.560
And then I'm going to
hand it over to David,

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.643
and he's going to talk
about a really cool product

00:01:03.643 --> 00:01:05.114
announcement we have today.

00:01:05.114 --> 00:01:07.530
But we're actually going to
spend most of the time talking

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.280
with you, the developers.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.080
So we have two developers here
we're going to invite on stage,

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.280
and we're going to engage
in a fireside chat format

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.250
with a discussion on what
playing fair means to them,

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.042
their principles, their
priorities, their challenges.

00:01:20.042 --> 00:01:21.750
And then if we have
some time at the end,

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.200
we'll save it for you
guys to ask us some Q&amp;A,

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.500
but nothing too hard.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.930
So when we started down
the path of playing fair,

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.280
we started with two main goals.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.790
The first was that we wanted
a balanced in-app purchase

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.150
economy.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.940
So if you think about
when you have a game

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.600
and you have a
currency in your game,

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.280
users pay money
for that currency.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.260
And so you're assigning
a monetary value

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:47.830
to that currency.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.580
And we want you to be
able to preserve this

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.870
so you control that and you
have full control over that.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.167
So that was the first
objective that we have.

00:01:56.167 --> 00:01:57.750
The second thing is
that we want to do

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.970
the right thing for all users.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.810
And this means that
for good users,

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.460
we want to provide a fair
and rewarding experience

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.760
on our platform.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.199
But we also, importantly,
want to deter the bad users.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:12.090
And so when we combine
those two objectives,

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.940
we hope that we can
achieve wins for you,

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.228
the developers, the users,
and us as Google Play.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.100
So let me talk
about our principles

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.680
to help us achieve these goals.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.550
The first is that we want to do
the right thing for all users

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:30.930
all the time.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.830
And this sounds like a really
big, googly, lofty goal.

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.330
But really, it
starts with assuming

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.240
that all users and all
developers are inherently good.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.860
And we really believe that.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.540
And so when they're
inherently good,

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.510
we can provide them access
to all of our services.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.600
And that's a really
important trait to us.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.510
But we know from experience,
and probably you do, too,

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.550
that not all users are good.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.320
And there's a very
small minority of them

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.480
that aren't good.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.590
And so we have to
evaluate everything

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.350
on a case-by-case basis or
an interaction-by-interaction

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.550
basis.

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.400
And to highlight this, let
me bring up an example.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.020
So who here in the audience has
made an in-app purchase before?

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.700
That's a good showing.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.575
I know I have myself.

00:03:13.575 --> 00:03:17.340
And so let's assume that you
give a developer some money,

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.990
and in turn, you get
in-game currency.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.500
Let's call them coins.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.090
Now let's suppose you want
to refund for your purchase.

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.370
Well, in today's in-app purchase
world, you get your money back.

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.060
But you also keep your coins,
which is a little bit weird.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.060
When you think about that
in the physical world,

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.910
that would be like
going to buy a vacuum

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.640
and wanting to return the
vacuum and get a refund,

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.380
but actually keeping the vacuum.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.360
And that's a little bit weird.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.280
And so when you think about a
good user who wants a refund,

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.470
we believe that they should
be willing to give up

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.040
their in-game currency
to get their money back.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.840
Now we think about the bad user.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.220
And they might not want
to give up their currency,

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.500
but it's still the
right thing to do.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.230
And so in all cases, both the
good user and the bad user,

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.570
giving up the currency
is the right thing to do.

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.060
And we believe that.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.900
So we took these two principles,
and we combined them together,

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.340
and we built an API.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.950
And the API will allow
you, the developer,

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.940
to access all of your
refunds for your games

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.880
so that you can take back
the currency from the users,

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.470
whether they're
good or they're bad,

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.290
and make your game
more balanced.

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.830
And that's the big product
announcement we have today.

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.710
So I'm going to hand it
over to David for him

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.132
to talk more about this.

00:04:34.132 --> 00:04:35.340
DAVID RIPHAGEN: Thanks, John.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.570
So it's 2:30.

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.480
We're in the basement, and
we're going to talk APIs.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.310
Cool.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.970
Yes.

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.428
So what I'm going
to do-- I'm going

00:04:43.428 --> 00:04:47.862
to talk a little bit about
how generic this API works.

00:04:47.862 --> 00:04:49.570
Then I'm going to give
you some examples.

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.888
We've been piloted for
about 10, 12 months now.

00:04:51.888 --> 00:04:53.346
And then I'm also
going to give you

00:04:53.346 --> 00:04:55.890
some examples about how some
of the developers we work with

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.400
have actually implemented this
and made huge, huge games.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.440
So I'll do a lot
of simplifications.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.500
If you have any questions,
go find John or me afterwards

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.010
and talk to us.

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.170
So the first thing we
did is we started looking

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:11.450
at all the refunded orders.

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.350
So these are orders that
either we gave a refund for

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.350
or that the bank has
given a chargeback on.

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:20.090
And we were trying
to think about

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.270
how can we get our developers
to know about these orders

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:28.910
so you can actually take that
physical vacuum cleaner back.

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.574
So what we did is we--
actually, let me just

00:05:32.574 --> 00:05:33.740
walk you through an example.

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.980
So what we did is we looked
at all the refunded orders.

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:41.390
A user comes into Google Play,
maybe made a $10 purchase

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:43.670
for 10,000 coins.

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:46.190
If we approve a refund
there, what we do now

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.310
is we store those orders
in a voided order table.

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:53.810
So these orders are labeled as
in do not deliver or claw back.

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.860
With the API, what you
can do as a developer--

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.290
you can call this API.

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.780
It's called the
Voided Purchases API.

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.150
You can receive the
data on that order,

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.430
and you can then
claw back the item.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.920
So what happens is the user
gets their refund approved.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.020
They get their $10.

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.290
But once you call that API
and you have that order,

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:14.720
you can take the
10,000 gems back.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.120
So we learned that this
works really, really

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.050
well for refunds.

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.500
And I have a next
slide on impact.

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.120
So we extended it to other
types of orders as well.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.630
We looked at cancellations.

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:29.620
We looked at banks or issuers
giving chargebacks out,

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.090
and we added those as well.

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.940
And this works really, really,
really well for bad users.

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.950
It also works well
for good users.

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:39.130
Because we believe
that as a good user,

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:41.090
you're OK getting
back to your money

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:44.970
and willing to give up the coins
that you purchased with it.

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:46.280
So here's the impact slide.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.770
We've been piloting this
for about 10 to 12 months

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:50.450
with a couple of
different developers.

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:53.210
We've seen really, really
big impact everywhere.

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:57.130
So on average, we see refunds
decrease with more than 60%

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:00.620
in about two to
three months' time.

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.060
So what happens is it takes
time for the community,

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.480
and especially for
abusers, to find out

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:09.150
that this abuse factor is gone.

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:11.662
So now we get into a
little bit more details.

00:07:11.662 --> 00:07:13.120
Because of course,
you want to know

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.930
how can I do this for my game.

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:16.820
So this is an Early Access API.

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:19.730
So you have to sign up, and
we'll show you a link later on.

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:21.830
And we'll also send you
the detailed documentation

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:23.621
so you don't have to
take pictures of this.

00:07:23.621 --> 00:07:27.320
But broadly, how it
works is you give us

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.750
the start time and the
end time of a time period

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:32.000
for which you want to have
all the voided purchases.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.740
You call our API.

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:37.850
We give you back a list of
orders keyed by purchase token.

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:39.830
And then what you can
do with that is you

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:44.570
can use that to revoke
access to those orders.

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:47.000
Let me talk to you a
little bit about the three

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.100
different approaches that we've
seen developers use our data.

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.880
I'll go from really, really
simple to more complicated.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:57.710
So the simplest way is
user purchases something

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:01.070
like 10,000 coins for $10.

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:03.800
We send you the voided
order, and what happens

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.880
is you claw back
exactly those 10,000

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:08.600
gems from the user's balance.

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.440
So the user is now--
their current balance

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:11.930
is minus 10,000.

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:15.020
But of course, there's many,
many games where you don't only

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:17.470
get 10,000 gems, but
you get 10,000 gems

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:21.310
plus one or two or maybe
three special characters.

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:23.060
So that's the second
case that we've seen,

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:27.440
is where developers say we don't
only claw back the 10,000 gems,

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.450
but also, we take
anything that we

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:32.780
added on to that-- some special
powers, special characters,

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:35.380
and we claw that back as well.

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:38.480
The third case that we've seen--
I guess the most complicated

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:41.450
case-- is where
you take snapshots

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:44.560
at the user state at
the moment of purchase.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:47.360
So say this user bought
these 10,000 gems,

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.000
say, two weeks ago,
and with those 10,000

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.850
gems was able to get
two special characters

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:54.560
and go up three levels.

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.410
What we've seen
is developers who,

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:58.420
m when they get
the refunded order,

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:00.950
take the user back two weeks.

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:03.527
And then the user is
actually back three levels,

00:09:03.527 --> 00:09:05.360
loses their two to three
special characters,

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.510
and loses the 10,000 gems.

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:09.800
So this worked really
well in stopping abuse.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:12.290
And we also really believe
that this works really, really

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:14.250
well for good users.

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:15.746
So to gain access,
of course, you

00:09:15.746 --> 00:09:18.370
need to have a developer account
registered with Google Play,

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:22.410
and you need to have a game
that accepts in-app purchases.

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:24.800
So if you want to
get started, this

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.600
is the point where I
would take a picture,

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.630
because we don't have this.

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:31.070
But there is a form
that you can fill out,

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:34.610
and then we'll whitelist
you for early access.

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:37.510
So John and I are really,
really excited to work with you

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:38.140
on this.

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:41.030
I think this is just the
start for us of getting a more

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:43.370
balanced economy
where we really try

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:47.060
to make the online experience
as fair and as balanced

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:49.610
as it is offline when you
buy your vacuum cleaner.

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:53.480
So going back to the goals
we had in the beginning--

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:56.150
we started to create a more
balanced in-app purchase

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:58.950
economy by allowing you
to claw back these items.

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:01.010
We're allowing access
to all developers.

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:04.050
It's early access now, but I'm
thinking maybe next quarter,

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:06.380
we'll open it up for everybody
if everything goes well.

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:08.960
And this creates
wins for all of us.

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.850
So we really see this
as an open discussion

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:14.430
between you, us, and our users.

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:16.400
So if you have any
questions, any suggestions

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:20.380
from your communities, feel
free to reach out to me, John.

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:25.090
Our email addresses will
be on the final slide.

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:27.420
So with that, I
actually would like

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:29.070
to invite two
developers on stage

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:33.450
to share their perspective
on fair play, which is going

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:35.350
to be really, really exciting.

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:37.790
So while we bring
up some chairs,

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:39.800
I'd like to invite
Emily Greer, who's

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.260
the co-founder and
CEO of Congregate,

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.900
and Regine Weiner, who's the
head of community and player

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:46.660
support for Space Ape.

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:49.546
And maybe we clap a little bit
while they put up the chairs.

00:10:49.546 --> 00:10:51.994
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:59.049
However way you want
to do it works for me.

00:10:59.049 --> 00:11:01.090
REGINE WEINER: Put on some
music, musical chairs?

00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:02.350
DAVID RIPHAGEN: Yeah,
we'll do musical chairs.

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:02.700
Yeah.

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:04.700
EMILY GREER: What's the fairest
way to do this is the question.

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:06.241
DAVID RIPHAGEN: The
fairest way to do

00:11:06.241 --> 00:11:09.100
this is I get all the chairs.

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:11.860
So Emily, maybe you
could start talking a bit

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:14.200
about your background
first, and then Regine,

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.825
and we'll dive into
some more questions.

00:11:16.825 --> 00:11:18.950
EMILY GREER: So I'm, as I
mentioned, the co-founder

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:19.965
and CEO of Congregate.

00:11:19.965 --> 00:11:21.590
If you're not familiar
with Congregate,

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:26.200
we started 10 years ago as
a browser game platform.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:30.020
Kind of think YouTube for games.

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:34.280
Maybe not appropriate
at an Android event.

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:37.610
But an open platform
where any developer

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:39.820
can upload a browser game.

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:45.920
We add a lot of social features
and in-app monetization,

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:47.950
in which case we
were responsible,

00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:50.300
like Google is now,
for the fraud, which

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:55.490
on PC can be probably more
intense than on mobile.

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:57.730
So that's an
interesting experience.

00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:00.580
And then we continue
to have that platform.

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:04.480
But about three years
ago, we entered mobile

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:08.850
as a mobile publisher and have
published more than 25 games,

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:11.950
including-- some
of our recent hits

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:14.900
include Adventure Capitalist,
Animation Throwdown, which

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:18.970
is top 50 grossing on Android,
and today, a Peter Molyneux

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:21.470
game called The Trail, which
is very interesting, at lunch

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:21.810
today.

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:22.935
So you should check it out.

00:12:22.935 --> 00:12:25.216
DAVID RIPHAGEN:
Congratulations on that.

00:12:25.216 --> 00:12:28.200
Regine, you want to give a
little bit of background?

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:31.160
REGINE WEINER: So--
oh, wow, that's loud.

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:34.160
My background is a little
over 15 years in the game

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.786
industry, starting out
at companies like Disney,

00:12:36.786 --> 00:12:38.660
making a trip through
Nickelodeon and Cartoon

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:41.450
Network along the way,
and finally ending

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:44.890
up at Space Ape Games in London
a little over two years ago.

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:47.510
My background is everything
from community support

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:51.620
to a little bit of development
to localization management

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:53.130
to project management.

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:54.800
So my background
has been varied,

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:57.200
and it's very much
player focused.

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.057
Our company is founded
on those principles.

00:13:00.057 --> 00:13:01.640
And when you have
that, you have to be

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:04.070
focused on every
aspect of development.

00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:05.434
as well as fair play.

00:13:05.434 --> 00:13:06.350
DAVID RIPHAGEN: Great.

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:08.110
So Regine, let's stay with you.

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:11.590
Can you maybe talk a little
bit about your philosophy,

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:13.580
your company's philosophy,
around that playing

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:15.440
fair and level playing fields?

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:18.370
REGINE WEINER: So we are
a company full of gamers.

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:21.260
We were built on
building our own games

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:22.820
and making sure
that we enjoy them,

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:25.019
and then making sure that
our players enjoy them.

00:13:25.019 --> 00:13:27.060
So when something doesn't
feel right in the game,

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:29.110
it's not going to feel
right to your players.

00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:33.120
And because we as players know
that and play it ourselves,

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:35.330
we're actually able to
balance the economy.

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:38.720
We're able to make sure that if
there's someone who, as an edge

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:42.760
case, is able to exploit the
system, we can identify that,

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:44.760
because we're thinking
about doing it ourselves.

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:46.759
We always want the
advantage, and players always

00:13:46.759 --> 00:13:48.720
want the advantage.

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:51.574
So I feel a few giggles
in the crowd on that one.

00:13:51.574 --> 00:13:52.990
But it is one of
those things when

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:55.035
you're looking at
competitive gaming--

00:13:55.035 --> 00:13:57.410
making sure that you're looking
at all the different ways

00:13:57.410 --> 00:13:59.750
that your game can be played and
making sure that you understand

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:01.833
how it's going to be played
by the different users

00:14:01.833 --> 00:14:04.564
that you have in your game.

00:14:04.564 --> 00:14:05.980
We look at it from
a level playing

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:08.347
field, everyone from our
spenders to our non-spenders.

00:14:08.347 --> 00:14:10.180
Because our spenders
wouldn't be in the game

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:12.640
if our non-spenders weren't
there to compete with.

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:15.380
Some of our non-spenders are
the most creative individuals

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:18.170
on the planet who are able to
compete against folks who are

00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:19.760
spending thousands of dollars.

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:23.030
And that comes from a
very well-balanced game.

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:24.710
Given that information,
we actually

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:28.190
are very cognizant when you
have an advantage in the game

00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:30.740
and you didn't buy it
and you didn't earn it.

00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:32.690
So we have to make sure
that we can claw back

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:35.540
those different
items as well and we

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:38.464
make it a level playing field
for both of those audiences.

00:14:38.464 --> 00:14:40.880
DAVID RIPHAGEN: Which aligns
really well with what we just

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.170
presented, I guess.

00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:43.820
Emily, what about Congregant?

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:45.339
How do you guys do this?

00:14:45.339 --> 00:14:47.380
EMILY GREER: One of our
core strategic principles

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:49.720
is building long-term
relationships.

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:53.690
And that includes developers,
players, partners, whoever.

00:14:53.690 --> 00:15:03.386
And one of the core precedents,
or something-- core things,

00:15:03.386 --> 00:15:04.760
base things that
you need to have

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:07.430
to have a long-term relationship
is you have to have trust

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:09.520
and build trust
over the long term.

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:13.180
And in a game and in
almost any situation,

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:16.090
it's impossible to build trust
if you don't have fairness.

00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:20.080
There's other elements like
transparency and emotional

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:20.890
connection.

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:25.630
But fairness is the base
of the trust pyramid

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:28.060
and has to be--
with every decision

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:33.400
that you think about, you
have to think of fairness.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:36.250
And you have to
think of-- you have

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:40.600
emotional responses to what's
fair to a particular player.

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:44.140
But as an important part of
community management and player

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:46.810
customer service is thinking
about what's fair broadly

00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:48.740
and not just to an individual.

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:51.655
DAVID RIPHAGEN: So let me
ask you a question about it.

00:15:51.655 --> 00:15:55.186
So you see fairness as
a key part of trust.

00:15:55.186 --> 00:15:57.310
How do you make sure that
everybody in your company

00:15:57.310 --> 00:15:59.080
is aligned on what's fair?

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:00.850
Because what's fair
for me might be

00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:05.039
not unfair for somebody else
who's looking at the same case.

00:16:05.039 --> 00:16:05.830
EMILY GREER: Right.

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:12.130
So a lot of this has been
trial and error and mistakes

00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:13.010
over the years.

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:15.804
And interesting--
because we're a platform,

00:16:15.804 --> 00:16:17.470
we get to see not
only our own mistakes.

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:19.550
We get to see the
mistakes of developers.

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:24.080
And so we get to see a
wide range of behavior.

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:28.150
And one of the things coming
out of various crises and things

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:32.290
that we've come as a
core principle is never

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:37.390
do anything for someone that
you wouldn't do for everybody,

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:41.080
or if you would do it
for a subset of people

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:44.980
that you wouldn't be OK
defending publicly on a forum,

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:46.870
on a live chat.

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:50.920
And that really helps clarify.

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:54.760
what's fair, is will you say it
publicly, will you defend it,

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:56.360
will all of us agree on it.

00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:01.090
And especially in a
customer service situation,

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:06.460
that's the bedrock, is can
everybody stand behind this.

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:10.295
And then once you hit that
mark, then it's probably fair.

00:17:10.295 --> 00:17:11.170
DAVID RIPHAGEN: Yeah.

00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:14.410
I like that where you're saying
the key question for fairness

00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:16.540
is how I would treat
one individual is

00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:18.700
how we treat everybody.

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:21.220
And how is everybody going
to think about that, and how

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:22.540
does it all play together?

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:24.069
You can't make everybody happy.

00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:26.319
That's completely impossible.

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:28.760
But there's a different
level of unhappiness

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:31.480
if with I didn't
get what I want,

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:34.540
but I see overall
that this is fair

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:39.430
versus I got screwed and
everybody got screwed.

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:42.470
JOHN MCGUIRE: Thanks for
sharing that perspective.

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:45.190
So we've announced this API
in this basement here today,

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:49.190
and it's really exciting but
I wanted to actually address

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:53.140
this question to Regine to talk
to you about your experiences

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:54.012
integrating the API.

00:17:54.012 --> 00:17:55.470
Because I believe
you've had those.

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:58.180
And tell us what
it's like and if you

00:17:58.180 --> 00:17:59.470
think it will be valuable.

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:02.230
REGINE WEINER: Oh, it's heaven.

00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:04.450
You guys laugh, but
player experience

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:06.844
starts with being able
to provide it to them.

00:18:06.844 --> 00:18:08.510
If you don't know
that this is happening

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:10.900
and you don't have a
way of dealing with it,

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:13.450
it is very difficult to look
your players in the face

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:15.580
and say that's not
happening in our game.

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:17.620
So having access to
the API and being

00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:20.740
able to bring back and claw back
the items is very important.

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:25.470
The hardest part of integrating
this API is not the API.

00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:27.520
It is deciding the
right way to remove

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:30.520
the items from your player so
that it's fair for everyone.

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:33.940
For example, if someone is
going to come in, use a gotcha,

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:36.400
not get what they want,
refund immediately,

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.550
and you're just going to
pull those gotcha items away

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:43.210
from them-- and, for example,
in our game, it's a duplicate,

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:45.160
but duplicates
give you resources.

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:47.660
So it's valuable to
your play style anyway.

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:50.530
But if you're going to actually
just pull those resources away

00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:53.020
from them, you're not going
to have the same impact.

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:55.930
However, if you're going to claw
back their last crystal pulls,

00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:58.020
they can't game the
system against you.

00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:00.940
You just pull the top
last 10 that they did.

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:04.300
Half of the challenge
with implementing this

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:06.940
is having three different
games with Samurai Siege, Rival

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:08.571
Kingdoms, and
Transformers Earth Wars

00:19:08.571 --> 00:19:10.320
and deciding how we
were going to approach

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:11.510
this in each of our games.

00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:12.910
Because it's not about coins.

00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:13.990
It's not about gems.

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:16.240
It's not about a
certain currency.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.700
It's about the gotcha
items and the value of them

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:20.330
and taking that experience.

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:21.830
The other thing you
don't want to do

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:24.220
is you don't want to
beat up a good player.

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:26.140
Someone came in,
they double tapped,

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:29.140
they weren't paying attention
when they made a purchase.

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:29.890
OK.

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:30.910
It happens to somebody.

00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:32.170
It's going to happen.

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:34.894
If that happens twice every
three months, it's acceptable.

00:19:34.894 --> 00:19:36.310
EMILY GREER: That
was never really

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:38.022
your money, and that's
a different thing.

00:19:38.022 --> 00:19:38.980
REGINE WEINER: Exactly.

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:41.390
It happens, so don't beat
your player up for that.

00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:44.410
However, if someone goes
to a restaurant 38 times

00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:46.660
and they eat their
meal 38 times,

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:49.390
they leave the restaurant, they
call their credit card company

00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:51.880
and they get a refund
on that meal 38 times,

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:53.032
that is criminal.

00:19:53.032 --> 00:19:54.490
It is not something
that you should

00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:56.260
allow to continue to happen.

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:58.450
Beyond that, you
have other patrons

00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:01.144
in that restaurant who are
paying for the same meal

00:20:01.144 --> 00:20:02.560
and are paying for
the opportunity

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:04.060
to perhaps have
that steak that they

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:07.960
couldn't have because someone
else paid for it refunded.

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:10.850
So you need to make sure that
you have a level playing field

00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:13.480
and that you're providing
them with a response that

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:15.890
is even and fair for everybody.

00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:17.410
You refund.

00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:18.730
It was more than twice.

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:20.230
This is how we handle it, guys.

00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:22.630
I'm sorry that you've done that.

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:24.490
We removed the items from you.

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:26.800
So the hardest part was
deciding how you were going

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:29.210
to remove it from each game.

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:31.760
The API itself is
something that someone

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:35.900
with base level technology
skills can actually do.

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:38.434
If your tech team is around
and has availability,

00:20:38.434 --> 00:20:41.100
you can hand it off to them, and
they'd have it done in an hour.

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:43.150
It's a batch process
on a nightly basis.

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:45.150
And if you hook it into
your system, it's great.

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:49.820
I would recommend
actually running it ad hoc

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:50.440
to begin with.

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:52.310
And the reason why I
say running it ad hoc

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:53.810
is you want to be able
to make sure that you're

00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:55.220
removing the right things.

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:57.110
You want to make sure there's
no double purchases in there.

00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:58.568
You want to make
sure-- by the way,

00:20:58.568 --> 00:21:01.160
the API now checks for
that, so it's brilliant.

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:03.710
You want to make sure that
the players are actually

00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:04.730
hearing this.

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:06.620
The other thing
which is more subtle

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:12.680
is once you start doing this,
your familiars, your cheers

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:17.220
gang, your MVPs, your VIPs
start talking to each other.

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:20.870
And it helps keep the
honest players honest.

00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:23.150
The fraud guys are
going to do it forever.

00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:25.375
But it helps keep-- it's
the lock on the door.

00:21:25.375 --> 00:21:26.125
EMILY GREER: Yeah.

00:21:26.125 --> 00:21:29.479
There's a group of
players who have

00:21:29.479 --> 00:21:31.520
so much fun exploiting
things that they're always

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:32.320
going to exploit.

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:33.800
And then there's people
who are so honest,

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:34.850
they'll always be honest.

00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:37.700
But the bell curve
are people who

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:39.800
will live up or down
to their situation.

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:42.110
So once fraud gets
going in a game,

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:46.440
it tends to spiral
out of control.

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:48.930
But the reverse is
possible with cleanup.

00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:50.720
And we've seen that
happen on our platform

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.400
with different games
that started out

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:55.130
fine, got into terrible
abuse problems,

00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:58.460
and then with hard work,
managed to get back

00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:00.150
to a more even playing field.

00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:01.983
REGINE WEINER: We have
incredible white hats

00:22:01.983 --> 00:22:02.590
in our game.

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:08.270
When we started bringing all
of the fraud back in to check

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:10.344
and removing items
from them, they're

00:22:10.344 --> 00:22:12.510
writing in and going, hey,
thank you for doing this.

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:15.051
I didn't realize that somebody
in my alliance was doing this,

00:22:15.051 --> 00:22:17.510
and we have zero
tolerance for that.

00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:20.270
And being thanked for that
was a very odd experience.

00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:23.120
It was not the response
I was expecting to see.

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:25.551
And it's because you're
leveling the playing field,

00:22:25.551 --> 00:22:27.050
and they no longer
feel like they're

00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:29.470
playing against themselves.

00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:31.640
JOHN MCGUIRE: That's
a really good point.

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:34.145
And I think the beauty and
the simplicity of this API

00:22:34.145 --> 00:22:38.360
is that you get to take what
is a very simple process, which

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:41.210
is a refund, and apply it in
the right way to your game.

00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:43.460
Because everybody
here has a game that's

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:45.290
different from each other.

00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:48.440
And it would be hard to say
apply this one way, this one

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:50.779
method to revoking a currency.

00:22:50.779 --> 00:22:52.820
And so you, I think, have
done a really great job

00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:54.770
of applying this in
your game in a way that

00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:56.480
makes sense for your community.

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:59.654
Emily, you are less familiar
with the API, I think.

00:22:59.654 --> 00:23:01.570
And wanted to get your
initial feedback on it.

00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:03.830
EMILY GREER: I'm only
familiar with our attempts

00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:06.030
on web to do something similar.

00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:07.507
But I'm really excited.

00:23:07.507 --> 00:23:09.590
Basically, from the moment
that we came to mobile,

00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:12.807
we were looking to figure out
if there was a way we could do

00:23:12.807 --> 00:23:14.390
something like this,
and there wasn't.

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:16.220
And now I can't
tell you how excited

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:17.900
I am that it's available.

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:19.880
JOHN MCGUIRE: We're
excited for you.

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:22.100
DAVID RIPHAGEN: Maybe taking
a little bit step back

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:25.580
in the conversation, we were
talking about good users

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:26.660
versus bad users.

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:30.560
Right So there's always a
small percentage of bad users

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:35.172
that will always keep on trying
for different types of motives.

00:23:35.172 --> 00:23:38.300
So how do you deal with those?

00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:41.090
Do you try to identify
them, and then

00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:44.060
what are the different
mechanisms that you use?

00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:45.590
Emily, maybe you
want to go first.

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:48.110
EMILY GREER: Yeah.

00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:50.510
Nothing is ever hack proof.

00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:55.380
And you could work
on it forever.

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:58.580
How we organize our
time is to think

00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:02.300
about what's the level of
impact of the cheating.

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:04.850
And that comes down-- it's
going to be very specific game

00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:06.440
to game to game.

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:08.420
And a lot of it
comes down to are

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:10.610
you cheating your own
experience or are you

00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:13.010
cheating other
people's experience.

00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:17.270
The amount of fraud
and cheating that we'll

00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:19.910
tolerate in a competitive
multiplayer game

00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:23.120
is really, really, really low.

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:24.950
But in a game like
Adventure Capitalists,

00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:28.610
if there's a hack where you
can change your phone and move

00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:30.590
time forward, and
there's no leaderboards,

00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:34.230
and there's no impact to
anybody but your own thrill

00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:37.237
at progress, we'd
like to stop that,

00:24:37.237 --> 00:24:39.320
but we're not going to put
as much effort into it.

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:42.710
It's not undermining the fun
of the game for other people.

00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:49.250
So it's more situational how
much effort we'll put into it.

00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:53.780
And there are
situations that are

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:57.320
in between-- like
leaderboards, for example,

00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:58.460
in a single player game.

00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:01.310
That is if you're
playing a game,

00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:04.640
and you see nothing but hat
scores and the leaderboard.

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:07.490
It's not changing
most of your feeling,

00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:10.230
but then it cheapens
your accomplishments.

00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:15.530
So that's a lighter touch than
a PVP competitive multiplayer

00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:17.820
game, but it's still
affecting your impact.

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:21.000
So then we'll-- especially
on Flash games on the web,

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:21.900
you can't stop it.

00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:24.810
But what we've
done is we identify

00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:26.970
what we think are
the cheater scores,

00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:30.300
and we show cheater
leaderboards to cheaters,

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:33.420
and we show non-cheater
leaderboards to everybody else.

00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:36.360
And cheaters keep cheating
and get their fun out of that.

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:39.420
And then people who aren't
cheaters get a true experience,

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:41.830
and that's how we manage
it in that situation.

00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:44.370
But in other situations, we'll
be much more zero tolerance.

00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:45.870
DAVID RIPHAGEN: So
you're telling me

00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:49.050
that my high score that I
see all the time is actually

00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:52.120
not a real high score, but I
fall into the cheater boards?

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:55.560
EMILY GREER: If you've
been cheating, yeah.

00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:57.900
You already knew it was fake.

00:25:57.900 --> 00:25:59.940
It then becomes a
competition of who's

00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:02.130
better at cheating, which
is its own competition.

00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:04.230
It's legitimate at
a certain level.

00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:05.105
DAVID RIPHAGEN: Yeah.

00:26:05.105 --> 00:26:08.940
But I guess in all seriousness,
what you're saying is cheating

00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:11.160
is bad, but there's
various degrees of bad.

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:12.890
And when it impacts
my good users

00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:16.470
to a certain extent when we talk
about wars of different clans

00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:22.020
or groups together, that's
when it impacts good users.

00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:28.320
EMILY GREER: And is it impacting
somebody else's progress?

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:31.140
That's much worse than
impacting somebody's sense

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:33.775
of achievement.

00:26:33.775 --> 00:26:36.150
JOHN MCGUIRE: Regine, we were
talking about this earlier,

00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:38.430
and you were talking
about some crafty ways

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:40.920
that you guys handled
cheaters and some of the ways

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:42.270
that you pooled them together.

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:45.170
I don't know if you want to
share some of your experiences

00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:45.670
there.

00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:48.610
REGINE WEINER: Very
similar to what she does.

00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:51.210
So it's something that
apparently we all haven't

00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:53.460
talked about, but I have a
feeling we've been removing

00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:55.770
cheaters from leaderboards
for a very long time,

00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:57.750
but showing it to
them so they continue

00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:59.970
to think that they're on
it and not try and find

00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:02.730
other ways to exploit issues.

00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:06.150
But even beyond that,
even down to kids' games,

00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:07.620
you have kids cursing in games.

00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:09.900
And what you do is
you actually show them

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:12.359
the curse words to themselves
so they get a kick out of it,

00:27:12.359 --> 00:27:14.441
but you don't show it to
the rest of your players,

00:27:14.441 --> 00:27:16.980
because you're impacting the
majority of your player base.

00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:18.563
And the same thing
goes with cheating.

00:27:18.563 --> 00:27:21.000
If someone is
actually using scores

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.670
and they're continually
running up the leaderboard

00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:25.899
and they look a little
bit out of whack,

00:27:25.899 --> 00:27:27.690
you move them into a
different leaderboard.

00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:30.690
But that's actually how we
engaged with you to begin with.

00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:33.450
We monitor everything
in our economy.

00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:37.770
And we found somebody who
is incredibly out of whack

00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:39.390
is the only way to describe it.

00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:41.280
We look at our numbers
every single week,

00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:43.620
and we know how
many gems they have,

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:45.900
how many diamonds they have,
how many items they have,

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:47.610
how many items they should have.

00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:51.090
And given this, it was
leaps and bounds higher than

00:27:51.090 --> 00:27:52.290
where it should have been.

00:27:52.290 --> 00:27:55.320
And it was one of those things
where 38 times-- and it was

00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:58.710
way more than that-- he
had gone to the restaurant

00:27:58.710 --> 00:28:00.430
and was able to
redeem the resources.

00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:03.054
And it was because of the number
of times that they had done it

00:28:03.054 --> 00:28:04.680
and how out of whack
the economy was

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:08.160
that we were able to
actually identify the user.

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:11.490
EMILY GREER: Do you ever
straight out ban users

00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:12.450
from the game?

00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:15.370
The API is about calling
back the rewards.

00:28:15.370 --> 00:28:17.220
But do you do you full bans?

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:22.100
REGINE WEINER: There is a
finite limit to our generosity.

00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:25.264
It's one of those things where
if you're an honest player

00:28:25.264 --> 00:28:27.430
and you've done it a few
times and we've given you--

00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:29.070
and by the way, we
do in-game warnings.

00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:31.151
So it's not a
surprise to anybody.

00:28:31.151 --> 00:28:32.400
You've got to be fair to them.

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:34.290
You've got to send them a
message saying-- I also give

00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:35.430
them warning that I'm doing it.

00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:37.200
So it's not that they've
logged into their account,

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:38.560
and all of a sudden, it's gone.

00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:40.260
It's this is coming.

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:41.150
You've done it.

00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:45.219
If you do this again,
you're not welcome anymore.

00:28:45.219 --> 00:28:47.010
That kind of behavior
has been able to stop

00:28:47.010 --> 00:28:48.440
the majority of these issues.

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:50.849
However, as with any
game, we have exploits.

00:28:50.849 --> 00:28:52.890
And when we detect the
exploits because something

00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:56.310
is out of bounds, even
better, we bounce them.

00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:57.180
So they compete.

00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:59.160
They do their-- it's one
of those things where

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:00.780
we impede their progress.

00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:01.920
They're in there.

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:04.530
They're playing their PVP.

00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:06.240
They defeat the base.

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:07.740
We detect the issue.

00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:09.030
We boot them from the game.

00:29:09.030 --> 00:29:10.040
They come back.

00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:10.870
They do it again.

00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:12.120
They get booted from the game.

00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:13.500
They don't get the resources.

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:15.060
They don't get their gems.

00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:17.070
They aren't able to gain
any advantage of it.

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:19.380
They aren't able to
continue their progress.

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:22.360
And for a while, it'll keep
the honest people honest.

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:24.655
However, it basically
serves as a honeypot.

00:29:24.655 --> 00:29:26.280
Because then people
will start changing

00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:29.239
the parameters to get just a
little bit of an advantage.

00:29:29.239 --> 00:29:30.780
And those are the
people that we look

00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:33.450
at when we say, OK, this
person is not a good person.

00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:34.720
They are not there to play.

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:35.790
They are not there to enjoy it.

00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:37.290
They're there to
exploit the systems

00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:38.430
and exploit other players.

00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:39.589
And that's when we ban.

00:29:39.589 --> 00:29:41.130
JOHN MCGUIRE: I
think that's actually

00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:45.090
a pretty good segue to the next
question, which is so we're

00:29:45.090 --> 00:29:46.530
going to launch this API.

00:29:46.530 --> 00:29:48.150
Everybody is going to sign up.

00:29:48.150 --> 00:29:52.140
What would you advise other
developers to-- how should they

00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:53.970
start thinking about fair play?

00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:57.540
What is the one, two, three of--

00:29:57.540 --> 00:30:00.360
EMILY GREER: Yeah.

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:05.550
There's pretty extreme examples
depending on the type of game.

00:30:05.550 --> 00:30:09.500
Adventure Capitalist is so
different from any of the space

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:14.550
games and RTS that the level
to which you need to do things

00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:16.350
is very different.

00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:19.290
I think the principle of
what's the impact to others

00:30:19.290 --> 00:30:23.580
and how you deal with it is
a good guiding principle.

00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:26.220
But to get-- I don't
think I can give you

00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:28.560
anything more detailed than
that, because it really

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:29.930
is about your game.

00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:35.580
And different developers have
different tolerances and ways

00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:37.410
they want to run their games.

00:30:37.410 --> 00:30:41.400
Some developers, on principle,
are more libertarian,

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:43.680
and some are more authoritarian.

00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:47.599
And ultimately, it's
your players' experience,

00:30:47.599 --> 00:30:48.390
but it's your game.

00:30:48.390 --> 00:30:50.970
And you can set
those ground rules,

00:30:50.970 --> 00:30:53.389
and they would probably
implement the API differently.

00:30:53.389 --> 00:30:54.180
JOHN MCGUIRE: Yeah.

00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:56.850
I think-- just to give one
tip, what we've typically

00:30:56.850 --> 00:31:00.850
done in our pilots is one to
two weeks of data analysis,

00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:03.660
so just looking at
histograms of where

00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:07.140
are the outliers of
people or countries

00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:11.255
or levels where it really
looks like really, really bad.

00:31:11.255 --> 00:31:12.630
And then I think
the second thing

00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:16.890
you do is if you see
a lot of volume there,

00:31:16.890 --> 00:31:18.140
how does it impact the others.

00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:21.090
That's probably a good
way to think about it.

00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:24.120
And then how would you
change your game economy

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:27.640
with the new information to
stop that egregious behavior.

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:30.330
REGINE WEINER: You might
also want to look at why.

00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:32.190
For example, if you're
running a gotcha game

00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:35.280
and your drop rates
are far too low,

00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:37.050
it's time to look at
your gotcha rates.

00:31:37.050 --> 00:31:38.700
If your gotcha rates
are far too low

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:40.585
and your refund
are far too high,

00:31:40.585 --> 00:31:41.960
it's time to have
a conversation.

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:44.580
EMILY GREER: And that gets
back to actually trust

00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:46.650
and to fairness.

00:31:46.650 --> 00:31:51.065
If players don't trust you,
they're more likely to cheat.

00:31:51.065 --> 00:31:52.440
They're also more
likely to cheat

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:53.731
if they don't trust each other.

00:31:53.731 --> 00:31:59.331
But you are a factor
in the equation.

00:31:59.331 --> 00:32:01.080
JOHN MCGUIRE: One of
the things that we've

00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:03.840
touched on in a few of
these conversations has

00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:08.280
been the role of community and
what that means for fair play.

00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:11.020
And they go hand in
hand in some ways.

00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:13.020
Because if you upset
your community,

00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:16.620
people are going to leave and
potentially abandon your game.

00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:19.800
Could you tell me how you think
about approaching community

00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:21.690
and the role that it
plays when you consider

00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:24.390
fair play in your games?

00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:26.610
REGINE WEINER: You
want to take a first?

00:32:26.610 --> 00:32:28.500
EMILY GREER: I guess.

00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:32.460
What I would say is
our goal is community.

00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:39.370
And fair play is a means to
creating a good community.

00:32:39.370 --> 00:32:45.510
And that community
is what-- let's

00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:47.640
say a game above a
pedestrian experience.

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:50.490
It makes it-- you
continue to play

00:32:50.490 --> 00:32:54.000
a game-- you'll play a game only
so long just for it being fun.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.850
You'll play a game so much
longer if you have friends

00:32:56.850 --> 00:32:59.250
and if you have an emotional
connection to the game.

00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:01.920
And that's something that
you get from community.

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:06.400
And so fairness is
a means to that end.

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:11.797
And that's how I think about it.

00:33:11.797 --> 00:33:13.380
REGINE WEINER: So
we love our players.

00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:15.510
I know you guys all say
you love your players.

00:33:15.510 --> 00:33:17.190
We love our players.

00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:18.510
They are welcome to come visit.

00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:21.660
That's how transparent we are.

00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:24.060
Specifically, the ways
we communicate with them

00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:26.470
are a little bit different
than a normal developer.

00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:28.590
Of course, we put our
release and patch notes out.

00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:30.150
Of course, we put up a wiki.

00:33:30.150 --> 00:33:32.460
Of course, we put
content and news feeds.

00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:35.430
But beyond that, they have
access to us via band chats.

00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:37.470
They have access via Twitch.

00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:40.200
Our developers are
sitting in Facebook pages.

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:43.050
It's very strange, but
it's very manageable.

00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:45.180
We have 20 to 30
million downloads.

00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:46.950
The number keeps
growing, obviously.

00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:48.700
And when you think
about it at that scale,

00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:50.250
you say how can I attack this.

00:33:50.250 --> 00:33:51.897
But you start with
your influencers,

00:33:51.897 --> 00:33:54.480
and you bring them in, and you
make sure that they understand.

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:56.700
And they become your
voice, and you create

00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:57.920
a relationship with them.

00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:59.410
And then the trust builds.

00:33:59.410 --> 00:34:01.920
And when trust is there,
believe it or not,

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:03.686
it's going to affect
your bottom line.

00:34:03.686 --> 00:34:05.310
Because they're going
to play one game.

00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:06.976
They're going to move
to your next game.

00:34:06.976 --> 00:34:09.060
They're going to move
to your third game.

00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:11.560
And you start building brand
affinity for your company,

00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:13.110
not just for your games.

00:34:13.110 --> 00:34:14.010
And they trust you.

00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:16.739
So when something does go
horribly wrong-- as we all

00:34:16.739 --> 00:34:19.800
know, as developers, they
do hourly, particularly

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:23.350
at lunch time, so I
feel for you today.

00:34:23.350 --> 00:34:25.290
It's going to be a long night.

00:34:25.290 --> 00:34:28.080
When you launch, having
that trust and that affinity

00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:31.139
and the transparency to be
able to say, hey, listen, guys,

00:34:31.139 --> 00:34:33.870
I acknowledge it, and
truth with your-- being

00:34:33.870 --> 00:34:36.697
very truthful with your
players, it gives them

00:34:36.697 --> 00:34:39.030
a little more breathing room
to say, hey, you know what?

00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:39.821
You guys messed up.

00:34:39.821 --> 00:34:41.639
I'm going to let it go.

00:34:41.639 --> 00:34:43.320
I'm going to give you
a bye on this one.

00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:44.850
But make sure you
take care of them.

00:34:44.850 --> 00:34:46.469
Would you want to
have-- for example,

00:34:46.469 --> 00:34:49.110
would you want to have an
item taken away from you?

00:34:49.110 --> 00:34:54.540
Would you want to have
one player receiving

00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:57.080
one bundle and another player
receiving a different type

00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:58.662
of bundle for half the cost?

00:34:58.662 --> 00:34:59.620
You wouldn't want that.

00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:00.994
So when those
issues pop up, make

00:35:00.994 --> 00:35:02.837
sure that you treat
players fairly.

00:35:02.837 --> 00:35:04.920
And they'll trust you more
and they'll spend more,

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:06.380
because they trust you.

00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:09.750
The other thing I will say is
we managed 24 by 7 support.

00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:11.900
We do it in 11
different languages.

00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:14.790
I've got 30 or so folks
who are embedded inside

00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:16.130
of the game teams.

00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:20.420
Each game team has a CCS lead
they feed back to the agents.

00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:22.590
Our agents can talk to our
developers at any point.

00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:25.320
So they don't feel like
they're having a conversation

00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:27.440
with an anonymous developer.

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:31.610
And they do see the actions
are resulting in feedback

00:35:31.610 --> 00:35:34.060
is being taken and implemented.

00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:37.190
JOHN MCGUIRE: So Google is
a very data-driven company.

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:39.330
We're known for being
a data-driven company.

00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:42.690
And one of the things we're
always into is measuring.

00:35:42.690 --> 00:35:47.130
And so do you, in this community
and this trust aspect-- how

00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:49.860
do you measure community
trust, or do you measure it?

00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:53.460
Because I'm sure some developers
are in the audience thinking,

00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:55.520
I could spend an
extra effort to go

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:59.790
through providing Twitch streams
and providing 24/7 support.

00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:03.300
But how do you measure the
community trust or sentiment,

00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:04.090
if you do?

00:36:04.090 --> 00:36:07.896
REGINE WEINER: Player purchases,
retention, lifetime value.

00:36:07.896 --> 00:36:10.020
JOHN MCGUIRE: And you can
draw direct correlations?

00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:11.330
REGINE WEINER: Absolutely.

00:36:11.330 --> 00:36:13.439
If you look at a lifetime
value of a company that

00:36:13.439 --> 00:36:15.980
doesn't have support versus a
company that does have support,

00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:18.630
you would find it
significantly higher.

00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:22.290
Or community events,
live events in-game--

00:36:22.290 --> 00:36:24.920
it shows that it's
active and alive

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:26.690
and they're willing
to stay for that.

00:36:26.690 --> 00:36:27.440
EMILY GREER: Yeah.

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:32.330
I would say it's hard
to measure directly.

00:36:32.330 --> 00:36:35.280
Retention is going
to be the best

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:37.610
measure by far--
long-term retention,

00:36:37.610 --> 00:36:40.040
obviously not short-term.

00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:42.110
And one of the things
that we like to look at

00:36:42.110 --> 00:36:47.360
is momentum and look
at not pure retention,

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:49.920
but looking at
ratios of retention.

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:54.170
So what's your change
from D7 to D30?

00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:56.097
What's your change
from D30 to D90?

00:36:56.097 --> 00:36:57.930
Because different games
and different genres

00:36:57.930 --> 00:36:59.513
are going to have
different baselines.

00:36:59.513 --> 00:37:02.900
But that tells you a lot
about that experience.

00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:04.962
So that's one way
of looking at it.

00:37:04.962 --> 00:37:06.420
But that's still--
a lot of that is

00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:10.250
going to come down to the game.

00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:13.080
One thing is you know
it when you see it.

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:16.070
If you go into a
forum, you can tell

00:37:16.070 --> 00:37:21.380
really quickly what the overall
sentiment in 10 minutes.

00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:24.290
And now you can't
measure that and track it

00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:25.630
in a really quick, clear way.

00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:29.000
But we do do some tracking.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.460
Our community management
do weekly summaries

00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:33.590
and sometimes daily
summaries for developers

00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:37.580
and talk about sentiment,
and we track that over time.

00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:39.080
And then the other
thing that we do

00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:44.230
is just tracking fraud rates
on purchases over time.

00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:47.880
And that's not going to tell
you strength of community,

00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:50.460
but it tells you when things
are going off the rails.

00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:53.520
And you will see that
happen pretty quickly,

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:56.130
and you will see it
come back down as well.

00:37:56.130 --> 00:37:58.730
That can be extremely dramatic.

00:37:58.730 --> 00:38:01.850
REGINE WEINER: So we
do win-back rates.

00:38:01.850 --> 00:38:06.540
Because players in the RTS genre
will burn out pretty quickly.

00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:08.361
Nine months in, they'll
say I need a break.

00:38:08.361 --> 00:38:10.610
Question is do they come
back a month and a half later

00:38:10.610 --> 00:38:12.150
because they're invested
in your community,

00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:13.520
they're invested in the game.

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:14.420
They're invested.

00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:15.770
They've taken their break.

00:38:15.770 --> 00:38:17.640
That's a very interesting
metric to look at.

00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:18.900
Do they come back?

00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:20.894
Do you reconnect with
them and say, hey,

00:38:20.894 --> 00:38:22.560
your account is always
going to be here,

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:25.020
and we've put some
extra goodies in there?

00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:27.110
If they come back, you
know you're doing right.

00:38:27.110 --> 00:38:30.960
If they don't come back and
you have a very high percentage

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:32.630
of opens and they
just delete it,

00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:34.339
that also is a very
interesting metric.

00:38:34.339 --> 00:38:36.630
Because they saw it, they
opened it, they looked at it,

00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:38.515
and they said nah.

00:38:38.515 --> 00:38:39.390
DAVID RIPHAGEN: Yeah.

00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:41.810
It's similar to long-term
retention with them

00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:42.450
in the break.

00:38:42.450 --> 00:38:45.060
I was wondering if there's any
questions from the audience.

00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:46.310
We've still got some time.

00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:51.570
You can shout them out or
use the microphone or both.

00:38:51.570 --> 00:38:53.940
AUDIENCE: Have you ever
done any cohort analysis

00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:56.390
on your high-value
consumers who've

00:38:56.390 --> 00:39:02.310
actually gone through
this fraud return system?

00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:03.650
REGINE WEINER: Yeah.

00:39:03.650 --> 00:39:06.590
So here's the great news-- there
are multiple different ways

00:39:06.590 --> 00:39:07.940
of implementing this.

00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:10.380
You can put these
people into the negative

00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:11.900
and make them re-earn back up.

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:14.580
And you do see them do that
if they're actively engaged.

00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:18.810
And if you see, for example,
your golden cohort just refunds

00:39:18.810 --> 00:39:22.880
his entire account, that guy is
never coming back regardless.

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:24.860
And it's really
interesting to do it,

00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:26.320
because the other
thing it does is

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:29.582
it increases the trust
with the existing players

00:39:29.582 --> 00:39:32.040
so they don't feel like they're
spending into a black hole.

00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:33.836
Your MVPs are
talking to each other

00:39:33.836 --> 00:39:35.210
every single day,
whether they're

00:39:35.210 --> 00:39:37.290
talking through the systems
that you've provided,

00:39:37.290 --> 00:39:40.020
or they're online, or
they're using BAND,

00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:41.820
or they're on
Facebook, or they're

00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:43.610
using any other mechanism.

00:39:43.610 --> 00:39:45.480
But they are talking
to each other.

00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:47.960
And as soon as one
person says, listen,

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:50.130
I refunded, and
this happened to me,

00:39:50.130 --> 00:39:52.540
it sweeps through
your entire community.

00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:53.390
And you know what?

00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:54.890
The majority of the
people are like,

00:39:54.890 --> 00:39:56.460
I'm glad they're
finally doing that.

00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:58.110
That was so unfair
that this guy had

00:39:58.110 --> 00:39:59.900
been doing that for six months.

00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:01.622
And they started spending more.

00:40:01.622 --> 00:40:03.120
It's been a nice bump.

00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:03.870
EMILY GREER: Yeah.

00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:09.230
And what I would say
is if you do something

00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:13.860
that the player doesn't like but
seems fair, they will retain.

00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:17.310
And we've seen that, because we
have so many games on our web

00:40:17.310 --> 00:40:18.140
platform.

00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:22.930
We've had games-- a
particular Chinese game that

00:40:22.930 --> 00:40:25.660
had a very different idea
of community management

00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:28.540
and customer service than
our players were expecting

00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:31.840
went into a full-blown
crisis that resulted in,

00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:36.360
I think, 70% of players
requesting refunds from us

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:37.690
in one month.

00:40:37.690 --> 00:40:47.370
And we worked through-- that was
trial by fire, and a lot of us

00:40:47.370 --> 00:40:49.690
10:00 PM phone calls
with translators

00:40:49.690 --> 00:40:50.940
to try and work through it.

00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:55.140
And what ended up happening is
we managed to save about half

00:40:55.140 --> 00:41:00.060
of the players to the game,
and the rest of the players

00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:03.435
we managed to save
to the platform.

00:41:03.435 --> 00:41:04.810
They still didn't
trust the game,

00:41:04.810 --> 00:41:08.440
but they trusted us in
terms of our attitude.

00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:11.830
And that was five years ago.

00:41:11.830 --> 00:41:14.060
And pretty much every
one of the big spenders

00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:18.356
who we went through that with
is still an active spender

00:41:18.356 --> 00:41:19.480
on the Congregate platform.

00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:25.140
So they weren't
happy, but they were--

00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:27.730
and we did claw
back a lot of stuff

00:41:27.730 --> 00:41:30.390
and banned some from
the game, but kept them

00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:31.890
on the platform,
complicated things.

00:41:31.890 --> 00:41:33.190
But you can keep them.

00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:35.189
And they're really,
really worth keeping.

00:41:35.189 --> 00:41:37.480
The people who are most upset
are the people most worth

00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:38.712
keeping.

00:41:38.712 --> 00:41:39.670
REGINE WEINER: Passion.

00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:40.420
EMILY GREER: Yeah.

00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:46.452
AUDIENCE: I actually
have two questions

00:41:46.452 --> 00:41:47.520
if you guys don't mind.

00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:50.640
First question is how
transparent are you guys

00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:53.500
with the community in terms of
when you guys are implementing

00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:57.040
bans or showing evidence, or
is it just very mysterious,

00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:59.770
like, hey, we've
caught these things?

00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:02.710
How much communication do you
have down to the specifics?

00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:05.730
REGINE WEINER: If I'm talking
to you and it's your account,

00:42:05.730 --> 00:42:07.270
you know what you've done.

00:42:07.270 --> 00:42:10.480
You don't know how I know,
but you know what you've done.

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:13.750
If I am talking to someone who's
trying to talk to me about you,

00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:14.920
my relationship is with you.

00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:17.710
My relationship is not
with your alliance leader.

00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:20.290
So we do tell them that
this is what we're doing.

00:42:20.290 --> 00:42:22.730
We do tell them that this is
how we're handling refunds.

00:42:22.730 --> 00:42:24.120
It's on our FAQs.

00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:27.070
It's in the public domain that
this is how we handle things

00:42:27.070 --> 00:42:29.790
and that we do a deal
with it and address it.

00:42:29.790 --> 00:42:32.050
However, I will never
discuss a player's account

00:42:32.050 --> 00:42:35.177
with someone that's
not the player.

00:42:35.177 --> 00:42:36.010
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:39.310
And then the second
question I have is

00:42:39.310 --> 00:42:42.310
whether with the clawback
API or just clawbacks

00:42:42.310 --> 00:42:47.020
and bans in general, are there
common pitfalls in which you

00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:51.690
guys have been overaggressive
or things to avoid?

00:42:51.690 --> 00:42:52.690
REGINE WEINER: There is.

00:42:52.690 --> 00:42:56.730
So make sure you're
logging everything.

00:42:56.730 --> 00:42:58.560
That's the reality of the game.

00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:00.400
You have to make sure
you log it so that you

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:01.794
know what you're taking away.

00:43:01.794 --> 00:43:03.210
The other thing
is take a snapshot

00:43:03.210 --> 00:43:06.789
before you take anything away
just in case you get it wrong.

00:43:06.789 --> 00:43:09.330
And if you do get it wrong, mea
culpa and give them something

00:43:09.330 --> 00:43:10.710
a little extra for your error.

00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:13.545
Don't be shy about it,
and don't try and hide it.

00:43:13.545 --> 00:43:16.170
The other thing I'll tell you is
that when you are clawing back

00:43:16.170 --> 00:43:18.090
something, the player
has done something

00:43:18.090 --> 00:43:19.540
they should not have done.

00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:22.230
And if they are a good
player, they acknowledge it

00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:24.960
and say, listen,
I got to refund.

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:26.560
I'm not entitled to this.

00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:28.540
If they're a bad player
and they're like,

00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:31.830
I have spent $4,500
with your company,

00:43:31.830 --> 00:43:34.790
and I only refunded
570 of it-- you're

00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:39.150
like, yeah, that's 570 errors.

00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:40.480
You don't get to keep it.

00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:43.560
And I do want to understand
why that person does it.

00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:47.080
So it's helpful, and we're able
to gather feedback from it.

00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:49.110
But in the end,
you've done something

00:43:49.110 --> 00:43:50.870
your knew you shouldn't
have been doing.

00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:52.080
You've been caught.

00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:54.047
Let's deal with it that way.

00:43:54.047 --> 00:43:56.130
DAVID RIPHAGEN: And maybe
to your first question--

00:43:56.130 --> 00:43:58.350
so in our pilots, we've
seen different types

00:43:58.350 --> 00:43:59.190
of communications.

00:43:59.190 --> 00:44:03.650
So I've seen one developer who
went out, created a website,

00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:06.180
had the community managers
talk to the community.

00:44:06.180 --> 00:44:09.459
And every time to refund--
an order gets clawed back,

00:44:09.459 --> 00:44:11.250
you actually have an
in-game message that's

00:44:11.250 --> 00:44:12.870
blocking that's a pop up.

00:44:12.870 --> 00:44:14.734
And it shows up in
your inbox as well.

00:44:14.734 --> 00:44:16.150
We have other
developers who do it

00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:18.370
more in the back
end, where they still

00:44:18.370 --> 00:44:20.610
take the gems away
and send you an email.

00:44:20.610 --> 00:44:21.900
So we've seen both.

00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:24.600
It really depends on how close
you are with your community.

00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:25.750
REGINE WEINER: Go in game.

00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:27.150
Always do it in game.

00:44:27.150 --> 00:44:29.170
I can't recommend it enough.

00:44:29.170 --> 00:44:31.060
EMILY GREER: The other
thing is whatever

00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:33.270
your communication
with a player,

00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:39.690
expect that it will be copy
pasted to other players,

00:44:39.690 --> 00:44:41.830
into forums, et cetera.

00:44:41.830 --> 00:44:46.770
So again, being really, really
consistent on your policies.

00:44:46.770 --> 00:44:51.210
And a lot of time, that means
getting everybody together

00:44:51.210 --> 00:44:54.630
and whiteboarding out exactly
what you're going to do,

00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:57.360
arguing it out, and getting
it straight so that you can

00:44:57.360 --> 00:44:59.620
have that total consistency.

00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:01.520
And if it's a major
error, especially

00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:04.020
if you've made a mistake and
you're trying to make it right,

00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:08.130
you want that totally
public and in your face.

00:45:08.130 --> 00:45:09.900
Something that's
more individual--

00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:11.190
yes, keep it individual.

00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:14.470
But again, if you
would mind having

00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:16.980
this email in your forums,
don't write that email.

00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:18.605
REGINE WEINER: It's
really interesting.

00:45:18.605 --> 00:45:20.820
We actually-- sorry.

00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:22.251
Are we over time?

00:45:22.251 --> 00:45:24.000
JOHN MCGUIRE: You can
finish your thought,

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.390
and then we're
going to finish up.

00:45:25.390 --> 00:45:26.431
REGINE WEINER: All right.

00:45:26.431 --> 00:45:29.560
So as everyone knows, we
had an outage or an issue

00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:31.609
with an attack on
the East Coast,

00:45:31.609 --> 00:45:32.900
and it's right during an event.

00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:35.170
And when you're
doing live events,

00:45:35.170 --> 00:45:36.775
you are feeling it
for the players.

00:45:36.775 --> 00:45:39.150
Because they want to get in
there, and they want to play,

00:45:39.150 --> 00:45:41.610
and it's a hard alliance event.

00:45:41.610 --> 00:45:43.290
Well, what do you
do for your players?

00:45:43.290 --> 00:45:46.180
Listen, I just lost 12
hours of this 36-hour

00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:48.785
or this 48-hour event.

00:45:48.785 --> 00:45:50.482
And it results in refunds.

00:45:50.482 --> 00:45:51.690
Because they're like, listen.

00:45:51.690 --> 00:45:52.480
I spent this money.

00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:53.230
I couldn't use it.

00:45:53.230 --> 00:45:54.690
I got in sporadically.

00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:56.900
What you do in that instance
is you extend the events

00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:57.612
if you can do it.

00:45:57.612 --> 00:45:59.070
But if you can't,
you need to level

00:45:59.070 --> 00:46:02.100
the playing field for
everybody who partook in it.

00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:03.540
And you need to
be vocal about it.

00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:05.710
You can't just say,
oh, well, your loss.

00:46:05.710 --> 00:46:07.900
That's not the right way
to develop a relationship

00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:09.819
with your audience,
your players.

00:46:09.819 --> 00:46:12.360
DAVID RIPHAGEN: That seems like
a really good note to end on.

00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:14.540
Regine, Emily, thank
you so much for joining.

00:46:14.540 --> 00:46:17.690
[APPLAUSE]
