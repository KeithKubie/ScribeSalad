TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hi.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:08.980
I'm Timothy Jordan, and I've
been your friendly developer

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.250
advocate here at Shoreline
Amphitheater for Google I/O

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:13.180
2017.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.340
For the past three days,
we've been checking out

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.902
all the really cool
in-person experiences

00:00:17.902 --> 00:00:20.110
that you might have otherwise
missed if you were just

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:21.680
watching the session videos.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.814
I hope you enjoyed
them as much as I did.

00:00:23.814 --> 00:00:25.480
And if you'd like to
see anything again,

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.410
check out g.co/io/guide.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.230
And hey, maybe next year, you
can join us here in person.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.740
I'm Timothy Jordan, and I'll
see you at Google I/O 2018.
