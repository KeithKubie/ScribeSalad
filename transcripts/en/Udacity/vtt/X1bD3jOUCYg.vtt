Just because one particular truth
assignment doesn't satisfy a Boolean

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:07.490
formula, doesn't mean that there
isn't a satisfying assignment.

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.620
See if you can find one for
this formula.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.530
Unless you're a good guesser,
this will take longer than just testing,

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.740
whether a given assignment
satisfies the formula.
