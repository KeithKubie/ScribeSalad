TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello.

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:03.510
I'm Timothy Jordan.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.885
And this is your update about
the coolest developers news

00:00:05.885 --> 00:00:08.202
from Google in the last week.

00:00:08.202 --> 00:00:10.160
The next maintenance
release for Android Nougat

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.076
is just around the corner,
and the public beta

00:00:12.076 --> 00:00:14.750
is now available to eligible
devices that have enrolled

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.520
in the Android Beta Program.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.250
For more info and to sign
up, head on over to the post

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.499
linked in the description below.

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:23.540
"The Guardian" was able
to substantially increase

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.160
user engagement
with its mobile app

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.320
during the recent
US election by using

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.150
new notifications functionality
available in the Android 7.0

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.915
Nougat.

00:00:31.915 --> 00:00:33.890
The engagement results
were impressive,

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.280
including a 103% increase
in daily installs

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.600
during an election week.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.660
Check out how they
did it on the post.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.690
In our continuous quest to
discover, nurture growth,

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.000
and showcase the best
games from Indonesia,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.970
we are happy to announce
the Indonesia Games Contest.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.520
Submit your game by
March 19 of this year.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.900
Details are on the post.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.494
We are open-sourcing
Google Earth Enterprise,

00:00:57.494 --> 00:00:58.910
the Enterprise
product that allows

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.940
developers to build and host
their own private maps and 3D

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:02.900
globes.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.210
Google Earth Enterprise Fusion,
Server, and Portable Server

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.080
source code will be published
on GitHub under the Apache 2

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.390
License in March.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.190
We've recently
published new guidelines

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:14.940
to help data providers
describe their data

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.080
sets in a structured way,
enabling Google and others

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.840
to link this structured metadata
with information describing

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.240
locations, scientific
publications,

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.310
or even Knowledge
Graph, facilitating

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.530
data discovery for others.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.180
We hope that this
metadata will help

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.850
us improve the discovery and
reuse of public data sets

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.080
on the web for everybody.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.160

data consumer, or a developer,

The Firebase Test Lab
team is kicking off 2017

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.930
with some new features
that make it easier

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.870

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.540
We recently launched the
beta version of Cloud Tools

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.480
for Eclipse, a plugin that
extends Eclipse to Google Cloud

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.470
Platform.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.500
Based on Google Cloud SDK,
the initial feature set

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.850
targets App Engine
standard environment,

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.540
including support for
creating applications, running

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.870
and debugging them inside the
IDE with the Eclipse Web Tools

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.620
platform tooling, and
deploying them to production.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.650
