00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.400
 
I thank you Matt it's a pleasure to be

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410
I thank you Matt it's a pleasure to be
 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.630
I thank you Matt it's a pleasure to be
here some ways the question of nuclear

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:22.640
here some ways the question of nuclear
 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.390
here some ways the question of nuclear
weapons both in the Cold War now do

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400
weapons both in the Cold War now do
 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.450
weapons both in the Cold War now do
bring together a lot of the interests

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460
bring together a lot of the interests
 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.740
bring together a lot of the interests
that of mine that Matt talks about in

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750
that of mine that Matt talks about in
 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.850
that of mine that Matt talks about in
fact I being born in 1940 some of my

first political memories deal with

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100
first political memories deal with
 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.570
first political memories deal with
nuclear weapons and new and strange

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580
nuclear weapons and new and strange
 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.230
nuclear weapons and new and strange
things and I've been puzzling about them

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240
things and I've been puzzling about them
 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.390
things and I've been puzzling about them
ever since what I want to do is talk

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400
ever since what I want to do is talk
 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.370
ever since what I want to do is talk
about nuclear weapons in the Cold War in

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.380
about nuclear weapons in the Cold War in
 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.830
about nuclear weapons in the Cold War in
two somewhat different ways and then

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840
two somewhat different ways and then
 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:05.700
two somewhat different ways and then
they carry over to Iran and North Korea

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710
 
 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:12.430
 
that I want to start by talking about to

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440
that I want to start by talking about to
 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.370
that I want to start by talking about to
drill the historiography of nuclear

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380
drill the historiography of nuclear
 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:20.140
drill the historiography of nuclear
weapons and the Cold War that is not the

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150
weapons and the Cold War that is not the
 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.480
weapons and the Cold War that is not the
history itself that how he's conceived

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490
history itself that how he's conceived
 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.909
history itself that how he's conceived
of the history and that sort of seems

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:24.919
of the history and that sort of seems
 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:27.130
of the history and that sort of seems
esoteric especially if you're not a

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:27.140
esoteric especially if you're not a
 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:30.430
esoteric especially if you're not a
history PhD student but actually it's

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440
history PhD student but actually it's
 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.420
history PhD student but actually it's
important for how we in many senses we

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430
important for how we in many senses we
 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:39.670
important for how we in many senses we
think about these problems and it

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680
think about these problems and it
 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.909
think about these problems and it
reveals I think something about the

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:42.919
reveals I think something about the
 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:46.030
reveals I think something about the
debates on what to do without or toward

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:46.040
debates on what to do without or toward
 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.070
debates on what to do without or toward
Iran and North Korea and why those

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080
Iran and North Korea and why those
 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.820
Iran and North Korea and why those
debates are very difficult

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830
 
 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.110
 
that's the first thing to note in this

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120
that's the first thing to note in this
 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.309
that's the first thing to note in this
context is I'm talking about nuclear

00:05:59.309 --> 00:05:59.319
context is I'm talking about nuclear
 

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:02.309
context is I'm talking about nuclear
weapons and the Cold War for the first

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:02.319
weapons and the Cold War for the first
 

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:05.059
weapons and the Cold War for the first
part of my talk and that's an

00:06:05.059 --> 00:06:05.069
part of my talk and that's an
 

00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:07.920
part of my talk and that's an
intersection and one question that's

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:07.930
intersection and one question that's
 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.679
intersection and one question that's
fascinating and contested and I'm not

00:06:10.679 --> 00:06:10.689
fascinating and contested and I'm not
 

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:13.980
fascinating and contested and I'm not
going to get into much is the

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:13.990
going to get into much is the
 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:17.489
going to get into much is the
relationship between the two you could

00:06:17.489 --> 00:06:17.499
relationship between the two you could
 

00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:20.100
relationship between the two you could
imagine a world of with nuclear weapons

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.110
imagine a world of with nuclear weapons
 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:24.260
imagine a world of with nuclear weapons
but no Cold War and certainly imagine

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:24.270
but no Cold War and certainly imagine
 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.249
but no Cold War and certainly imagine
counterfactual history of Soviet

00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:26.259
counterfactual history of Soviet
 

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:29.820
counterfactual history of Soviet
American rivalry without nuclear weapons

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:29.830
American rivalry without nuclear weapons
 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:32.309
American rivalry without nuclear weapons
more broadly historians and political

00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:32.319
more broadly historians and political
 

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:35.879
more broadly historians and political
science differ on how not only on

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:35.889
science differ on how not only on
 

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:38.459
science differ on how not only on
exactly what role nuclear weapons played

00:06:38.459 --> 00:06:38.469
exactly what role nuclear weapons played
 

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:40.140
exactly what role nuclear weapons played
in the Cold War did they stabilize at

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:40.150
in the Cold War did they stabilize at
 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:42.119
in the Cold War did they stabilize at
destabilizing I'll talk about that later

00:06:42.119 --> 00:06:42.129
destabilizing I'll talk about that later
 

00:06:42.129 --> 00:06:46.290
destabilizing I'll talk about that later
but how central to the Cold War were

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:46.300
but how central to the Cold War were
 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.829
but how central to the Cold War were
nuclear weapons and we often run them

00:06:49.829 --> 00:06:49.839
nuclear weapons and we often run them
 

00:06:49.839 --> 00:06:52.649
nuclear weapons and we often run them
together but actually saying how

00:06:52.649 --> 00:06:52.659
together but actually saying how
 

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:54.480
together but actually saying how
important nuclear weapons were to the

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:54.490
important nuclear weapons were to the
 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:56.820
important nuclear weapons were to the
Cold War or to turn that around how

important the Cold War was to the way we
 

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:00.809
important the Cold War was to the way we
have come to think about nuclear weapons

00:07:00.809 --> 00:07:00.819
have come to think about nuclear weapons
 

00:07:00.819 --> 00:07:05.010
have come to think about nuclear weapons
really are quite is not easy to say and

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:05.020
really are quite is not easy to say and
 

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:06.450
really are quite is not easy to say and
I know for those who are in the Hertog

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:06.460
I know for those who are in the Hertog
 

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.010
I know for those who are in the Hertog
program which is in some marvelous

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:08.020
program which is in some marvelous

opportunity for those of not only for

opportunity for those of not only for
you and for those of us who come to you

to talk about it

00:07:15.559 --> 00:07:15.569
to talk about it
 

00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:19.290
to talk about it
you know it isn't quite as clear as it

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:19.300
you know it isn't quite as clear as it
 

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.149
you know it isn't quite as clear as it
would seem at the outset because I think

00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:21.159
would seem at the outset because I think
 

00:07:21.159 --> 00:07:23.459
would seem at the outset because I think
we think of them together but remember

00:07:23.459 --> 00:07:23.469
we think of them together but remember
 

00:07:23.469 --> 00:07:26.999
we think of them together but remember
nuclear weapons were developed at least

00:07:26.999 --> 00:07:27.009
nuclear weapons were developed at least
 

00:07:27.009 --> 00:07:30.179
nuclear weapons were developed at least
in the US before there was a lot of

00:07:30.179 --> 00:07:30.189
in the US before there was a lot of
 

00:07:30.189 --> 00:07:32.730
in the US before there was a lot of
thought about the Cold War now there's a

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:32.740
thought about the Cold War now there's a
 

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:34.379
thought about the Cold War now there's a
big debate about whether the dropping of

00:07:34.379 --> 00:07:34.389
big debate about whether the dropping of
 

00:07:34.389 --> 00:07:37.019
big debate about whether the dropping of
the bombs was related to an attempt to

00:07:37.019 --> 00:07:37.029
the bombs was related to an attempt to
 

00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:38.820
the bombs was related to an attempt to
intimidate Soviet Union I think the

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:38.830
intimidate Soviet Union I think the
 

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:43.079
intimidate Soviet Union I think the
answer is largely no my good friend

00:07:43.079 --> 00:07:43.089
answer is largely no my good friend

argument that the Hiroshima bomb was not

argument that the Hiroshima bomb was not

argument that the Hiroshima bomb was not
related to the Soviet Union the Nagasaki

was it's ingenious as I've told Campbell

00:07:56.639 --> 00:07:56.649
was it's ingenious as I've told Campbell
 

00:07:56.649 --> 00:07:59.339
was it's ingenious as I've told Campbell
I think it's wrong but you know it is

00:07:59.339 --> 00:07:59.349
I think it's wrong but you know it is
 

00:07:59.349 --> 00:08:01.740
I think it's wrong but you know it is
ingenious the whole book the whole book

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:01.750
ingenious the whole book the whole book
 

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:05.850
ingenious the whole book the whole book
is ingenious and I think wrong but

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:05.860
is ingenious and I think wrong but
 

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:09.760
is ingenious and I think wrong but
yeah at least the arms developed without

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:09.770
yeah at least the arms developed without
 

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:11.830
yeah at least the arms developed without
the Cold War I think we would have had

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:11.840
the Cold War I think we would have had
 

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.780
the Cold War I think we would have had
nuclear weapons in the absence of the

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:13.790
nuclear weapons in the absence of the
 

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:19.450
nuclear weapons in the absence of the
Cold War eventually and the Soviet

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:19.460
Cold War eventually and the Soviet
 

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:21.400
Cold War eventually and the Soviet
American rivalry I think would have

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:21.410
American rivalry I think would have
 

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:23.470
American rivalry I think would have
existed without nuclear weapons might

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:23.480
existed without nuclear weapons might
 

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.870
existed without nuclear weapons might
have taken quite a different form come

back weather would have been more

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:26.900
back weather would have been more
 

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:29.260
back weather would have been more
dangerous but anyway the point is the

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:29.270
dangerous but anyway the point is the
 

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:33.150
dangerous but anyway the point is the
two are logically separable and

two are logically separable and
 

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:36.010
two are logically separable and
empirically when you look at a lot of

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:36.020
empirically when you look at a lot of
 

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:39.310
empirically when you look at a lot of
things and ask the question well what

00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:39.320
things and ask the question well what
 

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.350
things and ask the question well what
role did nuclear weapons play in this

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:41.360
role did nuclear weapons play in this
 

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.839
role did nuclear weapons play in this
crisis and that crisis in that general

00:08:43.839 --> 00:08:43.849
crisis and that crisis in that general
 

00:08:43.849 --> 00:08:47.740
crisis and that crisis in that general
outlook it is not it's not clear and

outlook it is not it's not clear and
 

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:49.870
outlook it is not it's not clear and
it's a very interesting question that is

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:49.880
it's a very interesting question that is
 

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.550
it's a very interesting question that is
really I think not been discussed a

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:51.560
really I think not been discussed a

weren't as many of them and they were

weren't as many of them and they were
 

00:13:38.169 --> 00:13:40.259
weren't as many of them and they were
influenced by the American debate so we

00:13:40.259 --> 00:13:40.269
influenced by the American debate so we
 

00:13:40.269 --> 00:13:42.659
influenced by the American debate so we
don't have as much of a good test of

00:13:42.659 --> 00:13:42.669
don't have as much of a good test of
 

00:13:42.669 --> 00:13:44.909
don't have as much of a good test of
whether this was sort of a universal of

whether this was sort of a universal of

the second half but the interesting

00:14:00.779 --> 00:14:00.789
the second half but the interesting
 

00:14:00.789 --> 00:14:04.799
the second half but the interesting
point for the historiography is the

00:14:04.799 --> 00:14:04.809
point for the historiography is the
 

00:14:04.809 --> 00:14:07.679
point for the historiography is the
relative lack of change throughout the

relative lack of change throughout the

Cold War and into the post Cold War
 

00:14:10.389 --> 00:14:13.079
Cold War and into the post Cold War
period now it's a relative lack I don't

00:14:13.079 --> 00:14:13.089
period now it's a relative lack I don't
 

00:14:13.089 --> 00:14:15.199

somewhat but but people did tend to see
 

00:14:24.699 --> 00:14:28.379

what's particularly interesting is that

00:14:31.739 --> 00:14:31.749
what's particularly interesting is that
 

00:14:31.749 --> 00:14:35.970
what's particularly interesting is that
after the Cold War you find the

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:35.980
after the Cold War you find the
 

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:38.279
after the Cold War you find the

Cold War and the way that surprising
 

00:14:46.929 --> 00:14:49.649
Cold War and the way that surprising
because the end of the Cold War brought

much better documentation and what you

00:15:17.039 --> 00:15:17.049
much better documentation and what you
 

00:15:17.049 --> 00:15:18.689
much better documentation and what you
find which this links to might in

and so people read the same documents

00:15:26.999 --> 00:15:27.009
and so people read the same documents
 

00:15:27.009 --> 00:15:31.350
and so people read the same documents
but they don't read them the same way if

historians and political scientists have
 

00:15:35.139 --> 00:15:36.689
historians and political scientists have
changed and why I think that's

00:15:36.689 --> 00:15:36.699
changed and why I think that's
 

00:15:36.699 --> 00:15:39.149

fascinating and not only at the level of

00:15:39.149 --> 00:15:39.159
fascinating and not only at the level of
 

00:15:39.159 --> 00:15:41.159

00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:26.220
because as you know if you know the
history of the crisis the first couple

00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:26.230
history of the crisis the first couple
 

00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:27.930
history of the crisis the first couple
of days they were tending toward an

00:32:27.930 --> 00:32:27.940
of days they were tending toward an
 

00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:29.669
of days they were tending toward an
airstrike doesn't mean that would have

00:32:29.669 --> 00:32:29.679
airstrike doesn't mean that would have
 

00:32:29.679 --> 00:32:31.320
airstrike doesn't mean that would have
triggered nuclear war but you know it

00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:31.330
triggered nuclear war but you know it
 

00:32:31.330 --> 00:32:34.820
triggered nuclear war but you know it
would have been different

00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:34.830
 
 

00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:37.140
 
another way is sort of again just

00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:37.150
another way is sort of again just
 

00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:39.299
another way is sort of again just
thinking of more crises let's say they'd

00:32:39.299 --> 00:32:39.309
thinking of more crises let's say they'd
 

00:32:39.309 --> 00:32:42.330
thinking of more crises let's say they'd
been another six or seven crises how

00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:42.340
been another six or seven crises how
 

00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:50.090
been another six or seven crises how
likely would we've had it's um I think

00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:50.100
likely would we've had it's um I think
 

00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:54.240
likely would we've had it's um I think
yeah one goes almost by I got instinct

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:54.250
yeah one goes almost by I got instinct
 

00:32:54.250 --> 00:33:01.730
yeah one goes almost by I got instinct
and I admit I go back and forth on this

00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:01.740
and I admit I go back and forth on this
 

00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:05.669
and I admit I go back and forth on this
I think it was more than luck we did

00:33:05.669 --> 00:33:05.679
I think it was more than luck we did
 

00:33:05.679 --> 00:33:10.289
I think it was more than luck we did
have a pretty long run of history but as

00:33:10.289 --> 00:33:10.299
have a pretty long run of history but as
 

00:33:10.299 --> 00:33:13.830
have a pretty long run of history but as
we know just looking at the Gulf of

00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:13.840
we know just looking at the Gulf of
 

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:16.919
we know just looking at the Gulf of
Mexico you know having a pretty long

00:33:16.919 --> 00:33:16.929
Mexico you know having a pretty long
 

00:33:16.929 --> 00:33:19.710
Mexico you know having a pretty long
string of cases where you don't have an

00:33:19.710 --> 00:33:19.720
string of cases where you don't have an
 

00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:21.810
string of cases where you don't have an
oil blowout doesn't mean you never will

00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:21.820
oil blowout doesn't mean you never will
 

00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:26.330
oil blowout doesn't mean you never will
the same way having that long string of

00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:26.340
the same way having that long string of
 

00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:31.950
the same way having that long string of
not war doesn't mean that you never were

00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:31.960
not war doesn't mean that you never were
 

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:35.549
not war doesn't mean that you never were
close to war one thing you can also get

00:33:35.549 --> 00:33:35.559
close to war one thing you can also get
 

00:33:35.559 --> 00:33:38.760

on people's beliefs you can look at some

00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:38.770
on people's beliefs you can look at some
 

00:33:38.770 --> 00:33:40.590
on people's beliefs you can look at some
of what people said especially the Cuban

00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:40.600
of what people said especially the Cuban
 

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:42.570

Missile Crisis yeah there problems with

00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:42.580
Missile Crisis yeah there problems with
 

00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:49.500
Missile Crisis yeah there problems with
that if you want in the question

00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:49.510
 
 

00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:52.500
 
the fact that it is so hard I think it

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:52.510
the fact that it is so hard I think it
 

00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:54.960
the fact that it is so hard I think it
gives more room for people's ideologies

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:54.970
gives more room for people's ideologies
 

00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:56.820
gives more room for people's ideologies
in influencing the answer they give and

00:33:56.820 --> 00:33:56.830
in influencing the answer they give and
 

00:33:56.830 --> 00:34:00.380

I don't mean ideologies pejoratively

00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:00.390
I don't mean ideologies pejoratively

people who believe in who worry a lot
 

00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:09.300
people who believe in who worry a lot
about nuclear spread tend to believe we

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:09.310
about nuclear spread tend to believe we
 

00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:15.300

were lucky people who believe

we were lucky and I'll come back to one
part of that so people who were more

00:34:29.850 --> 00:34:29.860
part of that so people who were more
 

00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:32.909
part of that so people who were more
relaxed about at least in retrospect on

the chances of war or not and this is
 

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:10.500
the chances of war or not and this is
again a very hard question because it's

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:10.510
again a very hard question because it's
 

00:35:10.510 --> 00:35:13.890
again a very hard question because it's
partly counterfactual and what we've

the chemical additive method would say

00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:18.280
the chemical additive method would say
 

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:20.490
the chemical additive method would say
well we could compare nuclear with

00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:20.500
well we could compare nuclear with
 

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:25.980
well we could compare nuclear with
non-nuclear worlds and we can say there

00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:25.990
non-nuclear worlds and we can say there
 

00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:29.100
non-nuclear worlds and we can say there
are a lot more wars in non-nuclear

00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:29.110
are a lot more wars in non-nuclear
 

00:35:29.110 --> 00:35:31.890
are a lot more wars in non-nuclear
worlds and do this two ways we can look

worlds and do this two ways we can look
 

00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:35.010
worlds and do this two ways we can look

fact that North Korea has now nuclear
 

00:57:17.759 --> 00:57:20.089

this I did not have

00:57:23.420 --> 00:57:23.430
this I did not have
 

00:57:23.430 --> 00:57:30.559
this I did not have
nuclear weapons when we look at Iran and

00:57:30.559 --> 00:57:30.569
nuclear weapons when we look at Iran and
 

00:57:30.569 --> 00:57:35.420
nuclear weapons when we look at Iran and
my responses that dove is if we didn't

00:57:35.420 --> 00:57:35.430
my responses that dove is if we didn't
 

00:57:35.430 --> 00:57:37.910
my responses that dove is if we didn't
if we just look at North Korean behavior

00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:37.920
if we just look at North Korean behavior
 

00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:41.480
if we just look at North Korean behavior
and we don't know that it has nuclear

00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:41.490
and we don't know that it has nuclear
 

00:57:41.490 --> 00:57:42.920
and we don't know that it has nuclear
weapons so we can't look at the two

00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:42.930
weapons so we can't look at the two
 

00:57:42.930 --> 00:57:45.440
weapons so we can't look at the two
nuclear tests obviously we look at their

00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:45.450
nuclear tests obviously we look at their
 

00:57:45.450 --> 00:57:48.049
nuclear tests obviously we look at their
external behavior can we see a big

00:57:48.049 --> 00:57:48.059
external behavior can we see a big
 

00:57:48.059 --> 00:57:50.839
external behavior can we see a big
change when they have nuclear weapons

00:57:50.839 --> 00:57:50.849
change when they have nuclear weapons
 

00:57:50.849 --> 00:57:53.780
change when they have nuclear weapons
and increase their stockpile my answer

00:57:53.780 --> 00:57:53.790
and increase their stockpile my answer
 

00:57:53.790 --> 00:57:56.210
and increase their stockpile my answer
is no I just don't think there's a big

00:57:56.210 --> 00:57:56.220
is no I just don't think there's a big
 

00:57:56.220 --> 00:57:56.930
is no I just don't think there's a big
change

00:57:56.930 --> 00:57:56.940
change
 

00:57:56.940 --> 00:57:59.299

know where we stand in terms of the
 

01:06:26.020 --> 01:06:28.680
know where we stand in terms of the
nuclear revolution especially if the US

01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:28.690
nuclear revolution especially if the US
 

01:06:28.690 --> 01:06:30.630

know one basic question would be what
 

01:06:43.270 --> 01:06:47.130
know one basic question would be what
should the goal be you know do you do

01:06:47.130 --> 01:06:47.140
should the goal be you know do you do
 

01:06:47.140 --> 01:06:49.050
should the goal be you know do you do
you say a lot of nice things about

revolution and all the the good they've

01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:53.770
revolution and all the the good they've
 

01:06:53.770 --> 01:06:56.520

working towards a world without nuclear
 

01:07:03.910 --> 01:07:07.260
working towards a world without nuclear
weapons and even short of that goal you

01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:07.270
weapons and even short of that goal you
 

01:07:07.270 --> 01:07:09.300

know do some of the you know aspects of
 

01:07:09.310 --> 01:07:12.600
know do some of the you know aspects of
the nuclear revolution come into

01:09:41.109 --> 01:09:44.249
part of it is you'd have to be able to
really go through the typical wonky so

01:09:44.249 --> 01:09:44.259
really go through the typical wonky so
 

01:09:44.259 --> 01:09:45.899
really go through the typical wonky so
in the area of stuff in the way that I

01:09:45.899 --> 01:09:45.909
in the area of stuff in the way that I
 

01:09:45.909 --> 01:09:49.110

War and thank God I've given up but

01:09:51.419 --> 01:09:51.429
War and thank God I've given up but
 

01:09:51.429 --> 01:09:54.350
War and thank God I've given up but
certainly we're well above that number

01:09:54.350 --> 01:09:54.360
certainly we're well above that number
 

01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:59.760
certainly we're well above that number
and I gather we were willing to make

01:09:59.760 --> 01:09:59.770
and I gather we were willing to make
 

01:09:59.770 --> 01:10:01.560
and I gather we were willing to make
cuts in some ways the Russian

and you know and we couldn't agree and
 

01:10:05.110 --> 01:10:08.790
and you know and we couldn't agree and
we caught the numbers we got now I don't

01:10:08.790 --> 01:10:08.800
we caught the numbers we got now I don't
 

01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:11.729
we caught the numbers we got now I don't
think the numbers matter a lot except

01:10:11.729 --> 01:10:11.739

they did it and that's really hard

01:11:26.790 --> 01:11:26.800
they did it and that's really hard
 

01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:29.399
they did it and that's really hard
because it used to be nuclear weapons

01:11:29.399 --> 01:11:29.409

we're a fast track in the Air Force and
now right if you're doing with the

01:11:32.669 --> 01:11:32.679
now right if you're doing with the
 

01:11:32.679 --> 01:11:34.350
now right if you're doing with the
nuclear weapons you're a dollar they're

01:11:34.350 --> 01:11:34.360
nuclear weapons you're a dollar they're
 

01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:36.060
nuclear weapons you're a dollar they're
never going to be used you know it's

them in retirement and that's a real

01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:46.570
them in retirement and that's a real
 

01:11:46.570 --> 01:11:47.510
them in retirement and that's a real
problem

01:11:47.510 --> 01:11:47.520
problem
 

01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:51.180
problem
organizationally how do you take this

01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:51.190
organizationally how do you take this
 

01:11:51.190 --> 01:11:55.169
organizationally how do you take this
and as seriously as it has to be when in

01:11:55.169 --> 01:11:55.179
and as seriously as it has to be when in

a way you're saying you're never going

a way you're saying you're never going
 

01:11:56.679 --> 01:11:59.069
a way you're saying you're never going
to use them not that's a real that's a

01:11:59.069 --> 01:11:59.079
to use them not that's a real that's a
 

01:11:59.079 --> 01:12:01.350
to use them not that's a real that's a
real challenge but I do think say we

01:12:01.350 --> 01:12:01.360
real challenge but I do think say we
 

01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:02.819
real challenge but I do think say we
have the paradox that we'd be better off

01:12:02.819 --> 01:12:02.829
have the paradox that we'd be better off
 

01:12:02.829 --> 01:12:06.050
have the paradox that we'd be better off
without them but we don't want to move

01:12:06.050 --> 01:12:06.060
without them but we don't want to move
 

01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:08.910
without them but we don't want to move
we don't want to move too

01:12:08.910 --> 01:12:08.920
we don't want to move too
 

01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:16.569
we don't want to move too

it I wrestle with it and one thing that
 

01:12:28.010 --> 01:12:30.850
it I wrestle with it and one thing that
I was wrestling with and still wrestling

01:12:30.850 --> 01:12:30.860
I was wrestling with and still wrestling

book is this a core question of our

01:12:35.890 --> 01:12:35.900
book is this a core question of our
 

01:12:35.900 --> 01:12:37.750

nuclear weapons stabilizing or not I

01:12:37.750 --> 01:12:37.760
nuclear weapons stabilizing or not I
 

01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:39.459
nuclear weapons stabilizing or not I
think you admitted I think I feel the

01:12:39.459 --> 01:12:39.469
think you admitted I think I feel the
 

01:12:39.469 --> 01:12:41.680
think you admitted I think I feel the
same way it's I go back and forth on

01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:41.690
same way it's I go back and forth on
 

01:12:41.690 --> 01:12:44.259
same way it's I go back and forth on
this one way that I try to think about

01:12:44.259 --> 01:12:44.269
this one way that I try to think about
 

01:12:44.269 --> 01:12:46.839
this one way that I try to think about
it is that maybe it's not the question

01:12:46.839 --> 01:12:46.849
it is that maybe it's not the question
 

01:12:46.849 --> 01:12:49.239
it is that maybe it's not the question
of their mere existence or who possesses

01:12:49.239 --> 01:12:49.249
of their mere existence or who possesses
 

01:12:49.249 --> 01:12:51.310
of their mere existence or who possesses
them but what people decide to do with

01:12:51.310 --> 01:12:51.320
them but what people decide to do with
 

01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:53.109
them but what people decide to do with
them now obviously they're very related

01:12:53.109 --> 01:12:53.119
them now obviously they're very related
 

01:12:53.119 --> 01:12:58.540
them now obviously they're very related
but connected to that I think your book

01:12:58.540 --> 01:12:58.550
but connected to that I think your book
 

01:12:58.550 --> 01:13:00.399
but connected to that I think your book
there's the two big arguments that you

01:13:00.399 --> 01:13:00.409
there's the two big arguments that you
 

01:13:00.409 --> 01:13:01.899
there's the two big arguments that you
make one that nuclear weapons are

01:13:01.899 --> 01:13:01.909
make one that nuclear weapons are
 

01:13:01.909 --> 01:13:03.489
make one that nuclear weapons are
essentially stabilizing because they're

01:13:03.489 --> 01:13:03.499
essentially stabilizing because they're
 

01:13:03.499 --> 01:13:05.529
essentially stabilizing because they're

they help in a defense dominant world
support the status quo is essentially

01:13:08.169 --> 01:13:08.179
support the status quo is essentially

support the status quo is essentially
right for people who use them with those

01:13:10.629 --> 01:13:10.639
right for people who use them with those
 

01:13:10.639 --> 01:13:14.649
right for people who use them with those
purposes but when people try to do more

01:13:14.649 --> 01:13:14.659
purposes but when people try to do more
 

01:13:14.659 --> 01:13:18.879
purposes but when people try to do more
with nuclear weapons than then that then

01:13:18.879 --> 01:13:18.889
with nuclear weapons than then that then
 

01:13:18.889 --> 01:13:21.069
with nuclear weapons than then that then
the sort of simple basic deterrence you

01:13:21.069 --> 01:13:21.079
the sort of simple basic deterrence you
 

01:13:21.079 --> 01:13:23.229
the sort of simple basic deterrence you
get into problem and where I think that

01:13:23.229 --> 01:13:23.239
get into problem and where I think that
 

01:13:23.239 --> 01:13:24.520
get into problem and where I think that
is a real problem we all think about the

01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:24.530
is a real problem we all think about the
 

01:13:24.530 --> 01:13:26.770
is a real problem we all think about the
coercive uses of it but I think it's

01:13:26.770 --> 01:13:26.780
coercive uses of it but I think it's
 

01:13:26.780 --> 01:13:28.779

up what happens this doesn't pick it up
 

01:24:57.070 --> 01:25:00.570
up what happens this doesn't pick it up
right until the last few days and then

but nothing about Vietnam so you know
communicating well these things are

01:25:11.220 --> 01:25:11.230
communicating well these things are
 

01:25:11.230 --> 01:25:15.180
communicating well these things are
difficult and especially in areas in

01:25:15.180 --> 01:25:15.190
difficult and especially in areas in
 

01:25:15.190 --> 01:25:17.939

which that are gray

01:25:17.939 --> 01:25:17.949

so yes extended deterrence is tricky

01:25:25.100 --> 01:25:25.110
so yes extended deterrence is tricky
 

01:25:25.110 --> 01:25:29.509
so yes extended deterrence is tricky
it's trickier in the post Cold War era

01:25:29.509 --> 01:25:29.519
it's trickier in the post Cold War era
 

01:25:29.519 --> 01:25:32.339
it's trickier in the post Cold War era
because we don't have the main theater

01:25:32.339 --> 01:25:32.349
because we don't have the main theater
 

01:25:32.349 --> 01:25:38.270
because we don't have the main theater
of Europe with the line and our

01:25:38.270 --> 01:25:38.280
of Europe with the line and our
 

01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:44.419
of Europe with the line and our
commitment to South Korea and Japan

01:25:44.419 --> 01:25:44.429
commitment to South Korea and Japan
 

01:25:44.429 --> 01:25:47.250
commitment to South Korea and Japan
isn't as great partly because you could

01:25:47.250 --> 01:25:47.260
isn't as great partly because you could
 

01:25:47.260 --> 01:25:50.069
isn't as great partly because you could
say well why should the u.s. care about

01:25:50.069 --> 01:25:50.079
say well why should the u.s. care about
 

01:25:50.079 --> 01:25:52.140
say well why should the u.s. care about
South Korea and Japan an interesting

01:25:52.140 --> 01:25:52.150
South Korea and Japan an interesting
 

01:25:52.150 --> 01:25:56.969
South Korea and Japan an interesting
question and especially how would the

01:25:56.969 --> 01:25:56.979
question and especially how would the
 

01:25:56.979 --> 01:25:58.979
question and especially how would the
North Korean Sea and we can play this

01:25:58.979 --> 01:25:58.989
North Korean Sea and we can play this
 

01:25:58.989 --> 01:26:01.500
North Korean Sea and we can play this
also in the Middle East so yes III agree

01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:01.510
also in the Middle East so yes III agree
 

01:26:01.510 --> 01:26:04.140
also in the Middle East so yes III agree
that the argument that the u.s. extended

01:26:04.140 --> 01:26:04.150
that the argument that the u.s. extended
 

01:26:04.150 --> 01:26:07.410
that the argument that the u.s. extended
deterrence is robust because the status

01:26:07.410 --> 01:26:07.420
deterrence is robust because the status
 

01:26:07.420 --> 01:26:12.419
deterrence is robust because the status
quo is clear to everyone and deterrence

01:26:12.419 --> 01:26:12.429
quo is clear to everyone and deterrence
 

01:26:12.429 --> 01:26:15.330
quo is clear to everyone and deterrence
is easier than Compellent doesn't work

01:26:15.330 --> 01:26:15.340
is easier than Compellent doesn't work
 

01:26:15.340 --> 01:26:17.759
is easier than Compellent doesn't work
as well on the other hand what ways on

01:26:17.759 --> 01:26:17.769
as well on the other hand what ways on
 

01:26:17.769 --> 01:26:21.149
as well on the other hand what ways on
the other side is that we're not talking

01:26:21.149 --> 01:26:21.159
the other side is that we're not talking
 

01:26:21.159 --> 01:26:24.540
the other side is that we're not talking
about mutual second strike capability so

01:26:24.540 --> 01:26:24.550
about mutual second strike capability so
 

01:26:24.550 --> 01:26:28.020
about mutual second strike capability so
Iran and North Korea are never going to

01:26:28.020 --> 01:26:28.030
Iran and North Korea are never going to
 

01:26:28.030 --> 01:26:30.180
Iran and North Korea are never going to
get anything like second strike

01:26:30.180 --> 01:26:30.190
get anything like second strike
 

01:26:30.190 --> 01:26:36.239
get anything like second strike
capability on the US so that makes it me

01:26:36.239 --> 01:26:36.249
capability on the US so that makes it me
 

01:26:36.249 --> 01:26:38.819
capability on the US so that makes it me
more confident in our extended

01:26:38.819 --> 01:26:38.829
more confident in our extended
 

01:26:38.829 --> 01:26:41.640
more confident in our extended
deterrence but I agree even in the Cold

01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:41.650
deterrence but I agree even in the Cold
 

01:26:41.650 --> 01:26:46.680
deterrence but I agree even in the Cold
War the arguments that the people who

01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:46.690

I think some of the I think some of the
 

01:29:29.380 --> 01:29:32.729
I think some of the I think some of the
worry is exaggerated but even a slight

01:29:32.729 --> 01:29:32.739
worry is exaggerated but even a slight
 

01:29:32.739 --> 01:29:35.610

I don't worry about Iran giving nuclear
 

01:29:41.469 --> 01:29:46.979
I don't worry about Iran giving nuclear
weapons to Hezbollah or Hamas because I

01:29:46.979 --> 01:29:46.989
weapons to Hezbollah or Hamas because I
 

01:29:46.989 --> 01:29:51.780
weapons to Hezbollah or Hamas because I
think they know very well it would mean

01:29:51.780 --> 01:29:51.790
think they know very well it would mean
 

01:29:51.790 --> 01:29:54.060
think they know very well it would mean
the end of the regime their regime I

01:29:54.060 --> 01:29:54.070
the end of the regime their regime I
 

01:29:54.070 --> 01:29:56.669
the end of the regime their regime I
mean I think if they did it didn't

01:29:56.669 --> 01:29:56.679
mean I think if they did it didn't
 

01:29:56.679 --> 01:29:59.370

they're safe but not only gets benefit
 

01:30:01.660 --> 01:30:09.090
they're safe but not only gets benefit
if Hezbollah or Hamas used it I think

01:30:09.090 --> 01:30:09.100
if Hezbollah or Hamas used it I think
 

01:30:09.100 --> 01:30:13.080
if Hezbollah or Hamas used it I think
Israel would destroy Iran I think Iran

01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:13.090
Israel would destroy Iran I think Iran
 

01:30:13.090 --> 01:30:18.050
Israel would destroy Iran I think Iran
would believe that so and we can

01:30:18.050 --> 01:30:18.060
would believe that so and we can
 

01:30:18.060 --> 01:30:21.270
would believe that so and we can
question and I don't I'm not I know very

01:30:21.270 --> 01:30:21.280
question and I don't I'm not I know very
 

01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:23.520

little about this what is the depth of

01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:23.530
little about this what is the depth of
 

01:30:23.530 --> 01:30:28.770
little about this what is the depth of
the Iranian anti Israeli commitment but

01:30:28.770 --> 01:30:28.780
the Iranian anti Israeli commitment but
 

01:30:28.780 --> 01:30:31.760
the Iranian anti Israeli commitment but
it can't be so deep as to put its own

01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:31.770
it can't be so deep as to put its own
 

01:30:31.770 --> 01:30:35.580
it can't be so deep as to put its own
life at risk so I don't think it would

01:30:35.580 --> 01:30:35.590
life at risk so I don't think it would
 

01:30:35.590 --> 01:30:37.620
life at risk so I don't think it would
give it could Hamas or Hezbollah steal

01:30:37.620 --> 01:30:37.630
give it could Hamas or Hezbollah steal
 

01:30:37.630 --> 01:30:40.860

it from Iran I doubt that I do worry

01:30:40.860 --> 01:30:40.870
it from Iran I doubt that I do worry
 

01:30:40.870 --> 01:30:43.740
it from Iran I doubt that I do worry
that if Iran gets nuclear weapons they

01:30:43.740 --> 01:30:43.750
that if Iran gets nuclear weapons they
 

01:30:43.750 --> 01:30:46.650
that if Iran gets nuclear weapons they
will not put in place as quickly as

01:30:46.650 --> 01:30:46.660
will not put in place as quickly as
 

01:30:46.660 --> 01:30:49.800
will not put in place as quickly as
possible all the ancillary things they

01:30:49.800 --> 01:30:49.810
possible all the ancillary things they
 

01:30:49.810 --> 01:30:52.680
possible all the ancillary things they
need that is the command the physical

01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:52.690
need that is the command the physical

the command and control presumably it

01:30:59.610 --> 01:30:59.620
the command and control presumably it
 

01:30:59.620 --> 01:31:03.090
the command and control presumably it
would be held by the IRGC not the army

01:31:03.090 --> 01:31:03.100
would be held by the IRGC not the army
 

01:31:03.100 --> 01:31:06.330
would be held by the IRGC not the army
and that's not entirely good news you

01:31:06.330 --> 01:31:06.340
and that's not entirely good news you
 

01:31:06.340 --> 01:31:08.820
and that's not entirely good news you
know would the other leaders realize

01:31:08.820 --> 01:31:08.830
know would the other leaders realize
 

01:31:08.830 --> 01:31:12.120
know would the other leaders realize
that you know how much you really need

01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:12.130
that you know how much you really need
 

01:31:12.130 --> 01:31:14.550

pounded the table and he convinced a lot
 

01:33:17.510 --> 01:33:19.510
pounded the table and he convinced a lot
of people to take this seriously and he

01:33:19.510 --> 01:33:19.520
of people to take this seriously and he
 

01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:21.490

think Saudi Arabia could produce weapons
 

01:34:47.300 --> 01:34:52.419
think Saudi Arabia could produce weapons
of its own in any manageable time but it

of its own in any manageable time but it
 

01:34:52.429 --> 01:34:55.209

that and then do you worry about

01:35:29.429 --> 01:35:29.439
that and then do you worry about
 

01:35:29.439 --> 01:35:34.409
that and then do you worry about
regional war you know would Iran stand

01:35:34.409 --> 01:35:34.419
regional war you know would Iran stand

so our rhetorical line may be feeding
some of these fears

01:36:29.469 --> 01:36:29.479
some of these fears
 

01:36:29.479 --> 01:36:32.500
some of these fears
I think if Iran gets nuclear weapons we

01:36:32.500 --> 01:36:32.510
I think if Iran gets nuclear weapons we
 

01:36:32.510 --> 01:36:34.719
I think if Iran gets nuclear weapons we
would certainly have to do things to

01:36:34.719 --> 01:36:34.729
would certainly have to do things to
 

01:36:34.729 --> 01:36:39.310
would certainly have to do things to
reassure the allies maybe explicit and

01:36:39.310 --> 01:36:39.320
reassure the allies maybe explicit and
 

01:36:39.320 --> 01:36:41.949

we want a stationed weapons in Saudi

01:36:44.259 --> 01:36:44.269
we want a stationed weapons in Saudi
 

01:36:44.269 --> 01:36:46.779
we want a stationed weapons in Saudi
Arabia but there are things I think we

01:36:46.779 --> 01:36:46.789
Arabia but there are things I think we
 

01:36:46.789 --> 01:36:49.319
Arabia but there are things I think we
could do that would be reassuring to

01:36:49.319 --> 01:36:49.329
could do that would be reassuring to
 

01:36:49.329 --> 01:36:51.520
could do that would be reassuring to
those countries on the other hand they

01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:51.530
those countries on the other hand they
 

01:36:51.530 --> 01:36:53.169
those countries on the other hand they
might themselves be dangerous and they

01:36:53.169 --> 01:36:53.179
might themselves be dangerous and they
 

01:36:53.179 --> 01:36:55.659
might themselves be dangerous and they
might not be necessary I mean to me they

01:36:55.659 --> 01:36:55.669
might not be necessary I mean to me they
 

01:36:55.669 --> 01:36:58.060
might not be necessary I mean to me they
might not be sufficient and so yes I

01:36:58.060 --> 01:36:58.070
might not be sufficient and so yes I
 

01:36:58.070 --> 01:37:00.009
might not be sufficient and so yes I
think the point about if you will the

01:37:00.009 --> 01:37:00.019
think the point about if you will the
 

01:37:00.019 --> 01:37:04.350
think the point about if you will the
second-order consequences are real and

01:37:04.350 --> 01:37:04.360

01:37:09.879 --> 01:37:09.889
Arabia equation what would the Turks do
 

01:37:09.889 --> 01:37:13.000
Arabia equation what would the Turks do
is an interesting interesting question

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:13.010
is an interesting interesting question
 

01:37:13.010 --> 01:37:16.750
is an interesting interesting question
and so yes I really would like to get

01:37:16.750 --> 01:37:16.760
and so yes I really would like to get
 

01:37:16.760 --> 01:37:20.409

Iran if I don't even get them out of the
 

01:37:20.419 --> 01:37:22.719
Iran if I don't even get them out of the
enrichment business I would like to keep

01:37:22.719 --> 01:37:22.729
enrichment business I would like to keep
 

01:37:22.729 --> 01:37:25.359
enrichment business I would like to keep
them a year or 18 months away from

01:37:25.359 --> 01:37:25.369
them a year or 18 months away from
 

01:37:25.369 --> 01:37:27.880
them a year or 18 months away from
nuclear weapons and I

01:37:27.880 --> 01:37:27.890
nuclear weapons and I
 

01:37:27.890 --> 01:37:29.980
nuclear weapons and I
to do that you have to engage in

01:37:29.980 --> 01:37:29.990
to do that you have to engage in
 

01:37:29.990 --> 01:37:33.250
to do that you have to engage in
diplomacy which for reasons I really

01:37:33.250 --> 01:37:33.260
diplomacy which for reasons I really
 

01:37:33.260 --> 01:37:34.930
diplomacy which for reasons I really
don't understand I think we have not

01:37:34.930 --> 01:37:34.940
don't understand I think we have not
 

01:37:34.940 --> 01:37:37.000
don't understand I think we have not
done just one word and then I'll stop

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:37.010
done just one word and then I'll stop
 

01:37:37.010 --> 01:37:41.800
done just one word and then I'll stop
that I think we should really take I

01:37:41.800 --> 01:37:41.810
that I think we should really take I
 

01:37:41.810 --> 01:37:46.060
that I think we should really take I
think the Iranian counter proposal about

01:37:46.060 --> 01:37:46.070
think the Iranian counter proposal about
 

01:37:46.070 --> 01:37:48.340
think the Iranian counter proposal about
doing this with the two Latia or the

01:37:48.340 --> 01:37:48.350
doing this with the two Latia or the
 

01:37:48.350 --> 01:37:51.790
doing this with the two Latia or the
swap deal in stages was quite reasonable

01:37:51.790 --> 01:37:51.800
swap deal in stages was quite reasonable
 

01:37:51.800 --> 01:37:54.250
swap deal in stages was quite reasonable
I think we should have taken that up

01:37:54.250 --> 01:37:54.260
I think we should have taken that up
 

01:37:54.260 --> 01:37:59.160
I think we should have taken that up
I think the Brazil Turkey deal is

01:37:59.160 --> 01:37:59.170
I think the Brazil Turkey deal is
 

01:37:59.170 --> 01:38:02.200
I think the Brazil Turkey deal is
reasonable with some conditions the main

01:38:02.200 --> 01:38:02.210
reasonable with some conditions the main
 

01:38:02.210 --> 01:38:05.590
reasonable with some conditions the main
one being that Iran cease enriching to

01:38:05.590 --> 01:38:05.600
one being that Iran cease enriching to
 

01:38:05.600 --> 01:38:09.370
one being that Iran cease enriching to
20% I think that's very reasonable and I

01:38:09.370 --> 01:38:09.380
20% I think that's very reasonable and I
 

01:38:09.380 --> 01:38:12.460
20% I think that's very reasonable and I
have argued to my former students who I

01:38:12.460 --> 01:38:12.470
have argued to my former students who I
 

01:38:12.470 --> 01:38:14.590
have argued to my former students who I
no longer influence that they should

01:38:14.590 --> 01:38:14.600
no longer influence that they should
 

01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:17.170
no longer influence that they should
really that's good to put would be good

01:38:17.170 --> 01:38:17.180
really that's good to put would be good
 

01:38:17.180 --> 01:38:20.470
really that's good to put would be good
for us we by significant time and see if

01:38:20.470 --> 01:38:20.480
for us we by significant time and see if
 

01:38:20.480 --> 01:38:22.870
for us we by significant time and see if
we get a deal and I think that's

01:38:22.870 --> 01:38:22.880
we get a deal and I think that's
 

01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:25.480
we get a deal and I think that's
particularly important because I think

01:38:25.480 --> 01:38:25.490
particularly important because I think
 

01:38:25.490 --> 01:38:28.180
particularly important because I think
there is a potential deal with Iran I

01:38:28.180 --> 01:38:28.190
there is a potential deal with Iran I
 

01:38:28.190 --> 01:38:30.280
there is a potential deal with Iran I
think this administration

01:38:30.280 --> 01:38:30.290
think this administration
 

01:38:30.290 --> 01:38:32.800
think this administration
unlike the Bush administration would be

01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:32.810
unlike the Bush administration would be
 

01:38:32.810 --> 01:38:37.240
unlike the Bush administration would be
willing to get a deal where Iran does

01:38:37.240 --> 01:38:37.250
willing to get a deal where Iran does
 

01:38:37.250 --> 01:38:41.740
willing to get a deal where Iran does
some enrichment of Leu in return for not

01:38:41.740 --> 01:38:41.750
some enrichment of Leu in return for not
 

01:38:41.750 --> 01:38:46.030
some enrichment of Leu in return for not
having a lot of stockpiles of Leu and a

01:38:46.030 --> 01:38:46.040
having a lot of stockpiles of Leu and a
 

01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:48.910
having a lot of stockpiles of Leu and a
good inspection regime I think this

01:38:48.910 --> 01:38:48.920
good inspection regime I think this
 

01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:51.250
good inspection regime I think this
administration would do that whereas the

01:38:51.250 --> 01:38:51.260
administration would do that whereas the
 

01:38:51.260 --> 01:38:53.560
administration would do that whereas the
Bush administration would not I think

01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:53.570
Bush administration would not I think
 

01:38:53.570 --> 01:38:57.520
Bush administration would not I think
Iran might well take that because the

01:38:57.520 --> 01:38:57.530
Iran might well take that because the
 

01:38:57.530 --> 01:39:00.160
Iran might well take that because the
alternative doesn't look good they could

01:39:00.160 --> 01:39:00.170
alternative doesn't look good they could
 

01:39:00.170 --> 01:39:02.860
alternative doesn't look good they could
claim that as a great victory internally

01:39:02.860 --> 01:39:02.870
claim that as a great victory internally
 

01:39:02.870 --> 01:39:04.360
claim that as a great victory internally
and I think that's what they're focused

01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:04.370
and I think that's what they're focused
 

01:39:04.370 --> 01:39:08.140
and I think that's what they're focused
on so here is something where I think we

01:39:08.140 --> 01:39:08.150
on so here is something where I think we
 

01:39:08.150 --> 01:39:11.020
on so here is something where I think we
might be able to get a deal if we can

01:39:11.020 --> 01:39:11.030
might be able to get a deal if we can
 

01:39:11.030 --> 01:39:14.650
might be able to get a deal if we can
get things going so I think you're it's

01:39:14.650 --> 01:39:14.660
get things going so I think you're it's
 

01:39:14.660 --> 01:39:17.560
get things going so I think you're it's
a special bore but I think those and I

01:39:17.560 --> 01:39:17.570
a special bore but I think those and I
 

01:39:17.570 --> 01:39:19.960
a special bore but I think those and I
think it is important to do it I don't

01:39:19.960 --> 01:39:19.970
think it is important to do it I don't
 

01:39:19.970 --> 01:39:22.510
think it is important to do it I don't
want to be blasé about this I think the

01:39:22.510 --> 01:39:22.520
want to be blasé about this I think the
 

01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:24.550
want to be blasé about this I think the
second-order consequences would be great

01:39:24.550 --> 01:39:24.560
second-order consequences would be great
 

01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:26.560
second-order consequences would be great
but I don't think we'll get there I mean

01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:26.570
but I don't think we'll get there I mean
 

01:39:26.570 --> 01:39:30.520
but I don't think we'll get there I mean
I think if I think Israel would attack

01:39:30.520 --> 01:39:30.530
I think if I think Israel would attack
 

01:39:30.530 --> 01:39:34.300
I think if I think Israel would attack
Natanz before there would be a bomb so I

01:39:34.300 --> 01:39:34.310
Natanz before there would be a bomb so I
 

01:39:34.310 --> 01:39:36.159
Natanz before there would be a bomb so I
don't think we're going to get

01:39:36.159 --> 01:39:36.169
don't think we're going to get
 

01:39:36.169 --> 01:39:38.439
don't think we're going to get
and I don't want to see that world but I

01:39:38.439 --> 01:39:38.449
and I don't want to see that world but I
 

01:39:38.449 --> 01:39:40.000
and I don't want to see that world but I
think the second order of things won't

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:40.010
think the second order of things won't
 

01:39:40.010 --> 01:39:43.689
think the second order of things won't
arise okay all right well I think that's

01:39:43.689 --> 01:39:43.699
arise okay all right well I think that's
 

01:39:43.699 --> 01:39:45.279
arise okay all right well I think that's
all we have time for

01:39:45.279 --> 01:39:45.289
all we have time for
 

01:39:45.289 --> 01:39:47.560
all we have time for
