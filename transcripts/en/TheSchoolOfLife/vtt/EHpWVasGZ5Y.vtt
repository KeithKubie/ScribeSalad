00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.240
Learning that someone hates us deeply even though we've done nothing ostensibly to provoke them

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.080
can be one of the most slamming situation we face.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.360
Because of technology, it's also liable to happen to us more and more

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.960
In the past, our enemies were restricted to the vicinity;

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.240
now, they lie scattered around the digital planet.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.760
In the past, we might once have unwisely read about ourselves in another's diary;

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.360
now, we can make a baleful error of quietly googling our own name.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.360
Being hated feels so serious for three (3) central reasons:

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.240
Because we see the hatred as a prelude to genuine practical danger;

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.880
Because we feel that those who hate us might be right,

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.480
that their negative information though unpleasant might have something important to teach us;

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:56.880
And because we implicitly trust in the basic wisdom soundness of mind and sagacity of the person delivering the attack.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.520
But each of these reasons is liable to be badly off the mark.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.400
Once upon a time, our enemies might have come to bludgeon us in the night,

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.720
no wonder we were very concerned.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.760
But now, almost always they can only ever impose a psychological wound,

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.600
their ill-will is unrelated to further action.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.000
And yet, it's as if an ancestral part of our minds had failed to notice our freedom,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.320
that we no longer live in tribes, and that we can flourish independently

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.920
in the vast and appoints delightfully anonymous cities of modernity,

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.520
unhampered by the narrow verdict of a few corrupt judges.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.600
Part of our vulnerability to hatred stems from the poignant

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.040
and at origin intelligent way, we tend to keep an open mind about criticism.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.040
We know at heart rightly that we have so much to learn from other people

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.880
so we continue to behave like the trusting school children we once were,

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.480
waiting to receive the opinions of broadly benevolent teachers.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.320
But this important capacity to learn may lack the necessary limits.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:08.800
What starts off as a virtue can in time leads to a desperate unnecessary vulnerability to any incoming information

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.240
and eventually a kind of madness

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:17.440
as we leave ourselves open to attack by those who plainly don't have our best interest at heart.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.800
We're seldom very good at filtering whether our enemies are well-qualified judges of our right to exist.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.760
In our panic at the news of hatred, we fail to ask ourselves the one important question:

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.000
Whether there is any truth in the attack?

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
But even when criticism is correct,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.920
we should never surrender our self-love to anyone who delivers it to us drenched in contempt.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.640
There is never any excuse for cruelty.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.400
We should distinguish between the critic and the hater.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.720
Whereas the critic limits the psychological significance and fall out of their point of contention,

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.660
the hater takes a small point of disagreement as a way of access

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.400
to deliver a wholesale bitter condemnation of us as human beings.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.920
There is a vast difference between declaring:

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.600
"YOU'RE FULL OF BULL SHIT!"

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.200
and clearing the throat to say:

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.120
"I THINK YOU'RE MISTAKEN ON THIS POINT."

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.080
The first move suggests that your error is a consequence of a fundamental rottenness.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.280
The second leaves open that you could be an honorable soul

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:23.880
who just happens to be like so many of us understandably confused on a complicated issue.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.640
We should ultimately trust that anyone who deliberately harms us

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.080
must be a highly damaged and therefore unreliable witness.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.760
We should not continue to believe that they may be frustrated but clever

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.080
like an exasperated but fundamentally wise teacher,

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.080
motivated by pursuit of the truth.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.840
However roughly handled, if one was truly wise insightful and mature,

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.240
one could never want to make another person collapse internally.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:55.520
The desire to hurt a stranger can only have big and troubled explanations behind it.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:02.480
Something distorting their judgement and stripping them of the right to destroy our self-confidence with impunity.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.720
None of us are blameless, we all have so much growing up to do.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.800
A distinct openness to criticism is key to our self-development

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.920
but we should aim for a confident distinction between the hater and the critic.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.440
We should be worried only by our genuine flaws

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:29.040
and otherwise forgive the injured roaring beasts who seek to punish us for their own unavowed sorrow.
