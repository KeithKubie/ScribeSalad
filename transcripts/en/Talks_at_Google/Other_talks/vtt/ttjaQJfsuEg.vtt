00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.280
Why do we learn?

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.310
What is it for?

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:06.340
It is for happiness

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.370
Happiness, what is this?

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.790
Is it to get into a good college or company,
and receive good compensation?

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.610
Is this what is considered as a happy life?

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:19.610
Not necessarily

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.670
A happy life, is to live it in your own way

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.010
You cannot learn it from someone else

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.810
It is something that you have to find with
your own will

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.570
For you to find it, you need an abundant amount
of knowledge and experience

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.670
And, you have to think with your own head

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.070
I founded a Math cram school for elementary
school students in 1993

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.190
My math classes are unique

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.989
I am a teacher by profession, but hate teaching

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.489
In reality, I don't teach my students

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.950
I call it the Theory of Teaching of Strength

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.660
I published this book through Discover in
2004

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.080
I kept on thinking how I could make my students
smarter

00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:01.450
I asked myself, if I explained it in a way
that is easy to understand and thorough would

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:02.450
this make the students smarter?

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:03.450
Not necessarily

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.670
If it would make them smarter, my job would
be very easy

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.310
When you explain it in this way, the students
start to have this illusion

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:22.229
That they understand, but they don't really
understand because they cannot answer it on

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.229
their own

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:29.080
When I was young, I loved to teach, I loved
it so much that I taught too much

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.720
These unlucky kids were not able to think
in their own head

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.850
That was my wrong doing, and I also think
it is a crime

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:35.850
I deeply regret this, and decided to turn
over a new leaf

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.439
So, how do I make the students smarter

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.049
I finally found the answer

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:41.740
The essence of studying math is to continuously
think

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.979
Addition, substraction, multiplication, division,
integer, fraction, minority

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.260
These are all of it

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.399
And all you need to do is match them together

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:51.939
There is no meaning in learning these matches
from anyone

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:54.590
It doesn't even make it fun or interesting

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.590
If you can answer the question, if you can't
answer the questions, it doesn't matter

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.450
If you can understand it, if you can't understand
them, it doesn't matter

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.320
You can't get the answer

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.310
You simply have to enjoy trial and error

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.310
In this way, the answer will come to you

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.890
Recently, I have had the chance to catch up
with my students in the past over drinks

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.910
Of course, everyone is of legal age

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.680
The graduates who I happen to reconnect with
are all enjoying life

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:27.750
When they were young, it is the same way they
enjoyed trial and error in my class

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.690
They enjoy the challenges in life

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.130
This gives me an extremely happy feeling

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.650
This is because, they are living proof that
my theory of education

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.670
"Teaching without teaching" has actually worked
the right way

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.930
By the way, do you know the puzzle that will
make you smart?

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.420
In this portion of this puzzle, this is called
the calculation block

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.640
IT is a puzzle where you calculate to solve
the problem

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.660
The calculation block's English name is "Ken
Ken"

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.170
It is on over 150 newspapers around the world

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.400
It is on the New York Times daily

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.300
In Japan, it is on the Yomiuri magazine bimonthly

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:04.850
It is also featured in the monthly publication
of Tokyo publishing's "Math for Middle School"

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.879
and "Math for High School"

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:15.209
I would 
like to talk about when I created this puzzle

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.090
In the first 2 years

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.700
The first 2 years I started the cram school

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.049
I only held math classes for 4th to 5th grade
primary school students

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.140
There are actually 4 types of problems in
math

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:35.170
There are easy ones that are fun, easy ones
that are boring, hard ones that are fun, and

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.129
hard ones that are boring

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:38.519
I only make fun problems

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.519
Only fun problems make the students smart

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:45.010
The fun problems win the heart of the student
and never let go

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.310
There was an interesting event that occurred
that proved this

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.310
In March 11th 2011

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:50.310
There was a massive earthquake

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.310
It was an afternoon on a Friday

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.790
I was on the way home

00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:00.810
The ground suddenly started moving, and it
was the biggest earthquake I had ever experienced

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.139
The next day and the day after the earthquake
held classes as usual

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:08.150
Not all transporation systems were back to
regular operation

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.489
But most of the students came to class

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.180
During the class, there were many after shocks

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.579
Back then, our class in Nihonbashi was on
the 12th floor of a 13 story pencil-thin building

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.720
At an intensity 2, we can very much feel the
shake

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:31.550
"Here it is!" we would shout, and a lot of
these intensity 2 and 3 after shocks would

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:32.550
come

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.430
I felt scared when I felt those earthquakes

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.700
But when I look at the students, none of them
would lift their head up

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:44.669
At first I thought "Despite the fear they
felt determined to work hard", but that wasn't

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:46.430
the case, they just didn't notice them

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:51.150
I have 4 classes, one for the 3rd grade, 4th
grade, 5th grade, and 6th grade

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.860
There are about 20 students in each class

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.389
In one class, we had after shocks many many
times

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:04.200
But no one, even once would lift their head
up to check what was going on

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.729
I was shocked, but I was impressed

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:10.450
But when you think about it, it isn't the
students that are extraordinary

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.360
Because they aren't chosen to participate
in the class

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.580
They weren't selected, actually anyone can
enroll

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:22.509
So, it is actual my study material that was
doing an excellent job

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:27.140
It greatly won over the children, even the
earthquakes they would not notice

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:31.180
It intensely attracted them, and with the
high concentration, they continued to think

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.050
I genuinely thought my materials were amazing

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.900
When I started the cram school, the first
2 years

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.140
I made most of the math problems from 4th
grade to 6th grade students

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:43.030
Right when I was thinking that I wanted to
do something new

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.970
I received requests from parents who had kids
in the 3rd grade

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:50.250
They asked me to start a class for 3rd graders

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.759
And I thought it for a week

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:57.311
Because I didn't really want 3rd grade students
to study math

00:05:57.311 --> 00:05:59.770
At this age, their concept formation has not
progressed, and it would only confuse them

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:05.949
If they were to study, it should be something
than can relate to when they start studying

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:07.110
math in 4th grade

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:11.100
I started looking for study material that
would let them enjoy writing and deleting

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:12.560
Then I found a puzzle

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.210
In 1995, I started a class on puzzles for
3rd grade students

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.210
They rapidly became absorbed in the puzzles

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.500
And, were able to think thoroughly for a longer
period

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.009
I created different kinds of puzzles almost
everyday

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:24.110
But it wasn't enough

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.639
I wanted a puzzle that required the four rules
of arithmetic

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:34.259
What came out of this is in 2003, I started
making the Ken Ken blocks

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:37.389
What I created first was a 4 by 4 with only
addition problems

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:39.810
Next is a 9 by 9 with only addition problems

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:44.000
Then next I created a mix of addition and
subtraction, then multiplication and division

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.920
Then I went on to create puzzles that made
all four rules mixed, and with operators

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:52.160
I went on to create these math calculation
blocks

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.560
And for my final challenge, I wondered what
would happen

00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:01.139
If I eliminated the operator from the puzzles
that had operators and a mix of all four rules

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:04.310
It became a very hard problem, but I was able
to form it

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:07.419
All of the challenges for a success, and I
was able to complete one world of Ken Ken

00:07:07.419 --> 00:07:08.419
blocks

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:09.419
"I made it!"

00:07:09.419 --> 00:07:10.419
I cried

00:07:10.419 --> 00:07:11.419
In the middle of the night I was running around
the classroom

00:07:11.419 --> 00:07:12.419
wondering if people always used to run around
like this.

00:07:12.419 --> 00:07:13.419
I have created different kinds of puzzles
up to this point

00:07:13.419 --> 00:07:16.699
This Ken Ken block is only one part of it

00:07:16.699 --> 00:07:18.289
But it is a special puzzle

00:07:18.289 --> 00:07:22.729
The calculation blocks would dramatically
increase the academic skills of the students

00:07:22.729 --> 00:07:24.569
They dare not give up

00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:26.050
They do not compromise

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:28.270
My educational theory "Teaching without teaching"

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:31.580
In this, the kids that continued to use their
heads

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:34.090
Went on to gain success in different fields

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:37.090
There are doctors, lawyers, bankers, professional
stock traders, scientists, and teachers

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:38.620
There is also a student that went into agriculture

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:39.620
There is also an artist

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:43.090
There is one that became a ballerina in a
famous Eurpean ballet company

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:45.979
She dances with the world as her stage

00:07:45.979 --> 00:07:49.590
The Ken Ken puzzles boosts the happiness of
the students

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:50.590
This is the existence it has become

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:55.449
Recently, I have the opportunity to go out
for a drink with a first batch graduate of

00:07:55.449 --> 00:07:56.449
the Ken Ken blocks

00:07:56.449 --> 00:07:57.449
He studies medicine at a top level university
in Japan

00:07:57.449 --> 00:08:00.620
Today he continues to focus on his future
and continues to work hard

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:06.759
I look forward to meeting other graduates
of the Ken Ken puzzles

00:08:06.759 --> 00:08:10.660
The students are not the only one who benefited
from the Ken Ken blocks

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:13.740
I have also benefited from it

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:16.860
The Ken Kken blocks has made me famous

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:19.920
On December 10, 2006, I was featured in the
show "JOUNETSU - TAIRIKU"

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:20.950
It received tremendous response

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:23.260
And the Ken Ken blocks has made me rich

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:24.290
It sold so much

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:27.770
Currently, I have a class in Manhattan and
in Nakano, Tokyo

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:30.889
8 months out of a year I spend in Manhattan

00:08:30.889 --> 00:08:33.550
And I spend the remaining 4 months in Tokyo

00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:35.800
This lifestyle has become very exciting and
fun

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:36.900
Before moving to Manhattan

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:41.110
I was living a very blessed life in Tokyo

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:44.840
I had no reason to start anything new

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.910
Just by doing the same thing, I can continue
to live a fun life

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:52.960
But in 2013, there were 2 events that greatly
changed my way of thinking

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:55.360
My experience started with an E-Mail

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:58.839
In the past, I only had interest in

00:08:58.839 --> 00:09:00.830
My classes and the students of my classes

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:06.510
The person who sent me the Email was from
a math teacher Melissa

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:08.670
from the American School of Paris

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:14.600
The Email read, In April, I will bring along
my students to go to Japan

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.760
Can I visit your class with my students?

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:21.310
I would like to let my students take your
classes

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:24.980
I heard that your class is close to Tokyo
station

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:26.130
I was surprised

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:31.060
At that time, I did not publicize the location
of my classroom

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:33.880
Even Japanese did not know where my class
room was

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.860
And, Melissa also understood my theory in
education

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:39.830
Then I thought about it for 1 week

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:43.320
I do not know how to speak English

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.740
And it still remains my deepest weakness until
this day

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:48.610
But as a result, I decided to take them in

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:51.140
It has undoubtedly become a great experience

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:52.690
This is for myself, and even for my visitors

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:54.440
Melissa and I exchanged Emails frequently

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:58.240
And after a new months, 3 teachers with 18
students came to Tokyo

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.290
The students were aged 14 to 16

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:02.880
For the first page, I prepared materials published
by Gakken

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:05.130
There were about 30 books on the table

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:10.830
And I told them "I will give you one book
each as a present, please pick one"

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:14.970
"But please pick wisely, you will be answering
the problems later"

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:19.750
They went on to peak into the content and
pick a puzzle that looked like they could

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:20.750
answer

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:23.880
Including 3 teachers, everyone held a book
and returned to their seats

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:27.950
Then I instructed "I will give you 50 minutes,
you can do whatever you want."

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:28.950
Everyone started solving the problems

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:29.950
No one gave up

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:31.620
Even Melissa was working on the questions

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:34.750
When I passed by her, she started talking
to me

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:36.630
She said "I cannot believe this"

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:40.350
"I have never seen these kids concentrate
for this long in solving problems."

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:41.350
I answered.

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:42.860
"That is the power of my study materials."

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:47.470
"Fun problems easily wins the hearts of the
student, and it does not let go."

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:51.240
The students from Paris said they wanted to
interact with Japanese students

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:54.170
So, I sent out an Email to the graduates

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:56.770
"There's this event, do you want to come?"

00:10:56.770 --> 00:10:58.730
There were 17 graduates that came

00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:00.630
The next stage was my new puzzle

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:03.950
It was a puzzle that no one has seen, and
it was a contest to solve them

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:05.209
3 top graduates were competing neck in neck

00:11:05.209 --> 00:11:06.209
One of them won the contest

00:11:06.209 --> 00:11:07.209
It was a very good match

00:11:07.209 --> 00:11:09.751
Though the students from Paris did not win,
worked hard and continued to solve the problems

00:11:09.751 --> 00:11:12.000
The next step was the one-on-one cultural
exchange

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.530
This is what we wanted to do the most

00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:17.340
The students from paris would draw a number

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:19.580
Then would converse with the students one-on-one

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:21.460
It was the first time speaking to foreigners

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:22.790
For many of the graduates

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:26.430
The students from Paris would speak very slowly
and properly at the beginning

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:30.730
But after a couple of minutes they would go
back to their normal speed

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:33.010
Looking at this, I thought to myself "They
probably have no clue what the other is saying"

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:34.410
But I let them be

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:37.519
And after this, most of the graduates that
took part in the event went on to study abroad

00:11:37.519 --> 00:11:39.740
The last stage was Karaoke

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:43.010
Everyone went to a Karaoke Box and sang only
one song

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:44.010
It was Carol King's "You've Got a Friend"

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:50.480
It is a beautiful song about a friend that's
somewhere far

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.079
But no one knew the song

00:11:53.079 --> 00:11:57.420
We sent out the URL of the Youtube video beforehand

00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:00.700
I told them to practice this 100 times because
we will be singing the song at the end of

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:01.700
the event

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:03.110
Everyone sang the loudest they can

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:06.200
And we sent them off to the station

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:13.610
This is most definetely one of the best days
in my life

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:15.570
This was the first time I held interest

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:16.700
In other students that weren't mine

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:19.320
After 5 days, Melissa sent me a heartfelt
Email

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:23.389
It read "During our visit to Japan, it was
the most memorable day we spent"

00:12:23.389 --> 00:12:27.910
"I would like to thank you and your staff
from the bottom of our hearts"

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:29.940
After reading the Email, I thought

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:34.560
"All the American School students of the world,
come to Japan, I will let you have a good

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:35.560
time!"

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:36.870
That is what I thought

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:38.529
It was an eye opener

00:12:38.529 --> 00:12:41.870
There were a couple of trendy looking girls

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:45.740
And I thought that these kids would not be
interested in my puzzles

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:46.839
Even they immersed themselves in the puzzle

00:12:46.839 --> 00:12:50.149
I want more children from other countries
to experience my puzzles

00:12:50.149 --> 00:12:51.550
That is what I thought

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:54.840
As much as possible I want to go to poor schools

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:58.520
And let them play the same puzzles

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:00.740
That is what I was thinking

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:04.310
After 1 month, since Melissa and the students
came to visit

00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:08.149
I had the opportunity to visit Chiang Rai
in the northern part of Thailand

00:13:08.149 --> 00:13:10.790
I thought many different things before going
there

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:14.430
I wanted to teach them how to solve and how
to make the Ken Ken puzzles

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:16.360
And I would tell them, "When you make 100
puzzles"

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:20.209
"I will bring them to the publisher, and publish
it as a book"

00:13:20.209 --> 00:13:24.670
"I will then donate all of the royalty to
the school"

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:31.160
This is what was running in my head when I
went to Thailand

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:32.160
I held a 90 minute class for 5th and 6th grade
students

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:33.160
Before going there a lot of people gave negative
comments

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:34.589
"It is impossible, you cannot teach math"

00:13:34.589 --> 00:13:35.700
I became very nervous

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:39.730
But when I went into the classroom, and started
to explain the sample problems

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:41.190
They were able to do it.

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:43.529
They, the same way as my students

00:13:43.529 --> 00:13:45.320
Had fun solving the Ken Ken blocks

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:46.700
Some of there were even very excellent students

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:54.120
They were able to solve the Ken Ken blocks,
and they were able to make them too

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:57.260
At this point, I thought

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.680
"The poor children around the world, invite
me!

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:00.829
I will entertain you!"

00:14:00.829 --> 00:14:03.429
These two experiences dramatically changed
my way of thinking

00:14:03.429 --> 00:14:06.740
I wanted to give classes students from different
countries

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:12.350
I was excited and wondered which students
from what country would come and visit me

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:13.350
next

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:15.130
Which school in what country can I visit next

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:16.930
I waited, and waited, and continued to wait

00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:18.010
But nothing happened

00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:19.880
I needed a new challenge to let myself grow

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:21.240
I asked myself, what should I do next?

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:25.960
After staying close to Tokyo station at the
center of Japan, where do I go next?

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:27.630
One idea came to mind

00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:28.630
New York, Manhattan.

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:29.630
Grand Central staion

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:33.950
In one night, I decided to move my classroom
from Tokyo to Manhattan

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:36.279
It was 5 months after the event

00:14:36.279 --> 00:14:39.279
The biggest benefit I gained from Ken Ken
blocks

00:14:39.279 --> 00:14:41.690
Is that it brought me to New York

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:46.480
I entered the country with a green card on
February 10th 2015

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:50.680
one month before this, I took an interview
at the U.S.A embassy in Tokyo

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:52.470
The interviewee told me "You have a great
visa."

00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:54.163
I had no idea what it meant

00:14:54.163 --> 00:14:56.529
When I went home, I researched it

00:14:56.529 --> 00:14:58.050
"America Green Card Category E11"

00:14:58.050 --> 00:14:59.050
This is what was written

00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:01.149
"Extraordinary ability in the science, arts,
education, business, or athletics"

00:15:01.149 --> 00:15:02.149
"This is impossible"

00:15:02.149 --> 00:15:03.149
I am an ordinary man

00:15:03.149 --> 00:15:04.149
I have no talent

00:15:04.149 --> 00:15:06.940
This is all thanks to the Ken Ken blocks

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:10.380
I have a dream that I have been nursing since
2008

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:12.760
There is infinite possibilities in the Ken
Ken blocks

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:16.231
Contests to solve the Ken Ken blocks are held
in different places all over the world

00:15:16.231 --> 00:15:19.160
The same set of puzzles are distributed to
everyone

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:25.060
With a ready set go, the person who solves
first wins

00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:27.170
But this has not satisfied me anymore

00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:28.990
Create a puzzle, and exchange it, then solve

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:31.820
I want to make it into a household competition

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:33.709
I continue to think about it

00:15:33.709 --> 00:15:37.620
In 2014, I had the opportunity to visit a
Japanese school in New York

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:39.610
They had puzzle contest for each year

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:43.660
We asked the 1st and 2nd place in contest
to create puzzle questions

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:49.880
In creating puzzles, the most important thing
is

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:51.570
There must only be one answer

00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:54.410
The problem with 2 or more answers will be
disqualified

00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:55.410
Disqualified, disqualified, disqualified

00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:59.000
The last class was the 2nd year of middle
school

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.160
The 1st place was a girl and the 2nd place
was a boy

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.920
1 minute after the girl finished, the boy
finished

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:12.000
The puzzle of the 2 were proper problems that
did not have any other answers

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.290
They would exchange this and solve each others
problems

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:17.589
We made the rule so that the girl would have
an upperhand

00:16:17.589 --> 00:16:22.949
The girl start first in solving the puzzle
the boy created

00:16:22.949 --> 00:16:27.430
And, after a minute, the boy will start solving
the girl made

00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:32.540
Since there was a minute difference, I thought
a come-from-behind victory would be impossible

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:33.540
But the boy won

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:37.750
When you try to make a puzzle quickly, it
will become easy

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:42.459
When you try to create it as fast as you can,
it creates risk having more than one answer

00:16:42.459 --> 00:16:46.389
It is very fun to make puzzles while thinking
of this

00:16:46.389 --> 00:16:52.680
In Shogi and Chess, the size of the board,
and the number of pieces are fixed

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:55.660
But with the Ken Ken blocks, from a 4 by 4
addition

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:58.259
To 9 by 9 with multiplication without an operator

00:16:58.259 --> 00:17:02.209
There are different types of different levelled
puzzles

00:17:02.209 --> 00:17:05.459
I think this suites the internet very well

00:17:05.459 --> 00:17:08.819
You can find an opponent that suites your
level

00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:12.850
There is no language barrier which enables
you to compete against anyone in the world

00:17:12.850 --> 00:17:18.049
For example, when you continously win against
5 players, you can be promoted to a higher

00:17:18.049 --> 00:17:19.049
level

00:17:19.049 --> 00:17:21.449
I think this could be a hit around the world

00:17:21.449 --> 00:17:26.589
If this becomes popular, the math ability
and cognitive faculty would rapidly increase

00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:29.560
It is fundamentally different from time-killing
games

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:33.940
And if possible, I would like to hold a world
tournament once in 4 years

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:35.740
Similar to the soccer world cup

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:40.299
There aren't many people that can join the
soccer world cup

00:17:40.299 --> 00:17:43.370
But anyone can join the Ken Ken block

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:48.240
I get excited on my own imagining how popular
this can be

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:50.160
Even surpassing the soccer world cup

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:56.840
I say to many people, "I want to do this,
what do you think?"

00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:01.150
But so far no one has fullfilled my dream

00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:06.790
I would be extremely happy if someone here
can help me fulfill this dream

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:10.110
I am going to show how Ken Ken blocks are
made

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:11.620
Later on, but before this

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:15.760
I would like to explain what kind of puzzle
Ken Ken block is

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:18.220
This machine has been acting since earlier

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:22.669
This may take time so I might have to talk
about something else

00:18:22.669 --> 00:18:24.110
Oh there it is.

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:25.929
Thank you very much

00:18:25.929 --> 00:18:30.030
This is a 4 by 4 Ken Ken block

00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:33.830
This is a Ken Ken block that is only addition

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:37.520
There are 4 numbers that can be used, 1, 2,
3, 4

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:41.210
The most important rule, the same number appears
once vertically and horizontally

00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:44.140
But you can cannot have the same number twice
in the same row and column

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:45.179
For example, 6 here

00:18:45.179 --> 00:18:49.820
This small number here, it shows the added
number of the total number of that block

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:53.160
The numbers you can use are 1, 2, 3, 4

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.809
Which are the combination that results to
6

00:18:55.809 --> 00:18:56.809
Has anyone asnwered?

00:18:56.809 --> 00:18:57.870
You can only use 1, 2, 3, 4

00:18:57.870 --> 00:18:58.960
3 and 3 cannot be used

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:01.340
2 and 4, this is addition so it is 2 and 4

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:10.310
At this point, you cannot tell which one is
4 and which one is 2, so we will write it

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:11.310
smaller

00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:12.310
Next is this 7

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:13.310
With two it is 7, what is the combination?

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:14.310
3 and 4, yes that's correct

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:18.350
In one of these blocks of 6, since one of
them will have 4 in it

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:21.919
The number on the block above must be

00:19:21.919 --> 00:19:22.919
3

00:19:22.919 --> 00:19:24.320
How about here, 4

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:27.470
There is 7 here also, the block above, 3

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:28.470
The block below, 4

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:30.920
Yes, there is 7 here also, the block above,
3, the block below, 4

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:34.160
If there is 3 and there is 4 here, the number
above must be?

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:35.160
2

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:36.160
Next to it, 4

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:37.160
Next to it, 1

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:38.160
Below, 2

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:39.400
There is also 3, if there is 2 here, the number
at the block above must be?

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:42.679
1, 2, which means what is the number here

00:19:42.679 --> 00:19:43.679
3

00:19:43.679 --> 00:19:45.830
Add it together 4, so next to it is?

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:46.830
1, here?

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:47.830
2, here?

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:49.380
1, that makes it complete

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:52.900
A typical math problem is not in anyway entertaining

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:56.440
And you simply write the answer and that is
it

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:59.500
You have to ask someone to check your answer

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:02.010
Or you have to check them yourself

00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:08.890
But with this puzzle, the moment you think
and fill in the answer, it is correct

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:14.169
The moment you fill the last block, you can
shout "Done!" and praise yourself

00:20:14.169 --> 00:20:15.169
It boosts your self-affirmation

00:20:15.169 --> 00:20:16.169
Next, let us see how puzzles are made

00:20:16.169 --> 00:20:17.240
First, you come up with the answer

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:20.270
Then you divide the blocks, and create the
problems

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:23.519
When you divide it in this way, 1 plus 2,
plus 3 is 6

00:20:23.519 --> 00:20:25.850
You can make 3 here

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:28.909
1 plus 2 plus 1 is 4

00:20:28.909 --> 00:20:31.560
1 plus 2 plus 1 is 4

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:32.980
3 plus 4 is 7

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:34.390
4 plus 2 is 6

00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:35.810
1 plus 2 is 3

00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:37.230
3 plus 4 is 7

00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:39.500
Here we have 1 puzzle and its answers

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:42.960
Let's erase all the answers, and here is our
puzzle

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:44.490
But this is not the end

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:49.470
We will not see if there is only one answer
to this puzzle

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:52.070
Normally, I would carefully do it on my own

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:54.289
Today, we will introduce a special software

00:20:54.289 --> 00:20:56.520
It's a software only I can use

00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:58.010
We will input it here

00:20:58.010 --> 00:20:59.309
Oh, it's this side

00:20:59.309 --> 00:21:00.610
With these 2, 7

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:01.909
With these 3, 4

00:21:01.909 --> 00:21:03.210
With these 2, 7

00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:04.510
With these 3, 6

00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:05.809
With these 2, 6

00:21:05.809 --> 00:21:07.110
With these 2, 7

00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:08.409
With these 2, 3

00:21:08.409 --> 00:21:10.480
Let's check the answers with this

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.420
Why isn't it coming up

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:15.070
Usually this doesn't take much.

00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:17.860
Oh, I see, because we still have this

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:19.220
It isn't logged in

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:21.600
On this, one whole puzzle is complete

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:24.320
So, who wants to try making a puzzle

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:25.679
Please, come over here

00:21:25.679 --> 00:21:26.679
Here

00:21:26.679 --> 00:21:28.289
So, please pick one from here

00:21:28.289 --> 00:21:32.250
Yes, please start underneath the camera here

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:33.429
Yes, here

00:21:33.429 --> 00:21:37.390
Everyone will be watching while I make it?

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:40.429
Yes, it is quite an experience you won't usually
have

00:21:40.429 --> 00:21:41.690
This is a bit embarassing

00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:42.690
It's alright

00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:50.929
If you do it right and only have one answer
then it won't be

00:21:50.929 --> 00:21:59.169
Yeah, that is true, but that would make it
boring

00:21:59.169 --> 00:22:00.169
Please make something fun

00:22:00.169 --> 00:22:03.320
How should I make it fun

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:10.190
Well, it's more fun when you think about it

00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:11.539
How could I do it

00:22:11.539 --> 00:22:14.320
Have you ever tried solving this puzzle?

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:15.320
No?

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:19.070
I have never seen anyone create it this boldly

00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:22.659
I thought it would make it more interesting

00:22:22.659 --> 00:22:23.659
Yes, it is interesting.

00:22:23.659 --> 00:22:25.090
It is the first time I have seen it

00:22:25.090 --> 00:22:26.480
Thank you

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.380
No, it is interesting

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:29.510
Here it is

00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:31.780
Let's put it in the software

00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:34.280
It is very bold, as might be expected from
Google

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:36.260
With 4 of these is 10

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:37.290
Oh, it disappeared

00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:38.290
Why

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:40.730
This, this, please wait, this is 7

00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:41.950
This is 7

00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:52.320
This is 7, and this is 4, then 13

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:55.900
What happens here?

00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:59.100
Does it come up until here?

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:02.810
But it has 7 here

00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:06.799
Is this one, this is as one, and then it's
1

00:23:06.799 --> 00:23:07.929
This means 1

00:23:07.929 --> 00:23:15.630
This is as one, and then it is 1

00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:18.580
Is this as one, and 1?

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:21.230
This is as one, and 1

00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:23.250
This is quite unique

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:24.250
This is 13

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:25.250
13

00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:26.570
In the center 5, and the rest 4

00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:28.659
It isn't wrong in numbers

00:23:28.659 --> 00:23:30.260
Is it right?

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:33.500
Let's check it

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:34.580
Check

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:44.429
Too bad, it was just 
a bit more

00:23:44.429 --> 00:23:45.429
Please

00:23:45.429 --> 00:23:47.270
Please pick one

00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:48.270
Yes

00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:51.400
Please keep it as a souvenir

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:52.480
Thank you

00:23:52.480 --> 00:24:07.320
This, when you get it right the first time,
it is no fun, but thank you for keeping it

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:08.320
interesting

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:09.320
Thank you

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:10.750
But it won't be that interesting

00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:11.750
Very interesting

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:12.750
This is 4

00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:14.150
This is also 4

00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:15.150
10

00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:17.770
I'll have Google line this all up for me.

00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:18.770
7

00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:19.770
9, then 9

00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:20.770
3 and

00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:21.770
3

00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:22.770
So, let's check it

00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:23.770
Congratulations

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:26.220
Please return it here

00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:27.540
Power Point

00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:31.500
Almost every day, I make puzzles

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:35.650
When you count only the Ken Ken blocks

00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:38.520
I have probably made over 5,000

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:45.700
It is still fun when I solve my own puzzles

00:24:45.700 --> 00:25:00.590
I am determined to spread this around the
world

00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:04.320
The Ken Ken puzzle next

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:14.330
There are 3 ways to enjoy the Ken Ken puzzles

00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:19.780
The same way as how to enjoy cuisines

00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:29.809
The way to enjoy cuisines are, eating them,
cooking them

00:25:29.809 --> 00:25:32.770
Cooking them and letting others eat them

00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:36.809
The same way goes with puzzles

00:25:36.809 --> 00:25:44.340
You can enjoy by solving, by creating

00:25:44.340 --> 00:26:02.480
And enjoying by letting others solve those
you created

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:07.820
It is a very fun puzzle

00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:11.929
Moreover, it makes one smart

00:26:11.929 --> 00:26:18.850
I will repeat, but it is a completely different
dimension

00:26:18.850 --> 00:26:21.169
Compared to silly time-killing games

00:26:21.169 --> 00:26:23.850
What is most important

00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:43.780
Is to use your head to concentrate and think
long and deeply

00:26:43.780 --> 00:27:24.380
And the rival is 

00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:30.570
not someone next to you

00:27:30.570 --> 00:27:36.480
But it is you from yesterday

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:51.620
In my book, I actually have published 180
books

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:57.140
I often get asked to autograph my books

00:27:57.140 --> 00:28:06.130
And what I always write on there

00:28:06.130 --> 00:28:19.820
Is 

00:28:19.820 --> 00:29:09.380
to improve your personal best

00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:12.659
Math is a puzzle

00:29:12.659 --> 00:29:14.240
Puzzles are fun

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:17.679
Which means math is fun

00:29:17.679 --> 00:30:34.890
It is the best entertainment to train your
brain

00:30:34.890 --> 00:31:24.899
For 

00:31:24.899 --> 00:34:13.670
a happy way of living, for a happy life

00:34:13.670 --> 00:36:23.570
Please think on 

00:36:23.570 --> 00:38:02.560
your own, and give it 
all 

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:38.740
you got in enjoying trial and error

00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:50.619
That 

00:38:50.619 --> 00:39:23.090
is all, thank you very much
