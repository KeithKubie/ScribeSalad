quite interesting too is that parents

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810
quite interesting too is that parents
 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.529
quite interesting too is that parents
are older and they and they have fewer

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539
are older and they and they have fewer
 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.620
are older and they and they have fewer
children so you could imagine that that

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630
children so you could imagine that that
 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.570
children so you could imagine that that
hothouse environment in some sense has

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580
hothouse environment in some sense has
 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.970
hothouse environment in some sense has
been exaggerated for a bunch of reasons

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980
been exaggerated for a bunch of reasons
 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.000
been exaggerated for a bunch of reasons
one is well your child is a lot more

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010
one is well your child is a lot more

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200
valuable to you if you're older and you
 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.170
valuable to you if you're older and you
only have one or two right because

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180
only have one or two right because
 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.250
only have one or two right because
you're not gonna get another chance

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260
you're not gonna get another chance
 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.959
you're not gonna get another chance
that's first of all you might have had

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969
that's first of all you might have had
 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.400
that's first of all you might have had
some trouble having the child to begin

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410
some trouble having the child to begin
 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.529
some trouble having the child to begin
with and you're not gonna get another

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539
with and you're not gonna get another
 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.569
with and you're not gonna get another
chance so you've got all your eggs are

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579
chance so you've got all your eggs are

in one basket so to speak and then of
 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.189
in one basket so to speak and then of
course children don't have the number of

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199
course children don't have the number of
 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.290
course children don't have the number of
siblings they used to have and one of

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300
siblings they used to have and one of
 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.819
siblings they used to have and one of
the things that's really useful about

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829
the things that's really useful about
 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.770
the things that's really useful about
having siblings is that they keep you in

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780
having siblings is that they keep you in
 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.010
having siblings is that they keep you in
your place right they their primary

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020
your place right they their primary
 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.029
your place right they their primary
socialization agents and I mean that can

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039
socialization agents and I mean that can
 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.490
socialization agents and I mean that can
be brutal and that's reflected say in

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500
be brutal and that's reflected say in
 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.170
be brutal and that's reflected say in
the story of Cain and Abel you know that

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180
the story of Cain and Abel you know that
 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.060
the story of Cain and Abel you know that
that internal household dynamic with

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070
that internal household dynamic with
 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.500
that internal household dynamic with
siblings can be can really become

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510
siblings can be can really become
 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.600
siblings can be can really become
murderous and that has to be kept under

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610
murderous and that has to be kept under
 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.149
murderous and that has to be kept under
control but I think the the hothouse

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159
control but I think the the hothouse
 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.929
control but I think the the hothouse

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590
testing any dominance hierarchy testing
 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.109
testing any dominance hierarchy testing
of the sort that you said that men do

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119
of the sort that you said that men do
 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.999
of the sort that you said that men do
part of that's the consequence of being

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009
part of that's the consequence of being
 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.399
part of that's the consequence of being
raised by older parents who have excess

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409
raised by older parents who have excess
 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.679

resources who have no siblings because

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689
resources who have no siblings because
 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.469

the child is then of course special and

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479
the child is then of course special and
 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.230
the child is then of course special and
that specialness well there seems to be

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240
that specialness well there seems to be
 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.060
that specialness well there seems to be
an inverse relationship between that

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070
an inverse relationship between that
 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.880
an inverse relationship between that
specialness that's protected and the

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890
specialness that's protected and the
 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.100
specialness that's protected and the

person's robustness and resilience and
so and then that's caught into or not

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360
so and then that's caught into or not
 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.520
so and then that's caught into or not
caught into that's that's pandered to by

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530
caught into that's that's pandered to by

time and that's something I also can't
 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.620
time and that's something I also can't
understand at all because that's a huge
