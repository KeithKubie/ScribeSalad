00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.540
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WELL, THAT'S IT
FOR TONIGHT'S "REPORT."

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.840
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, THAT'S IT
FOR THE 2014 MIDTERMS, BUT MOST

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.342
IMPORTANTLY, THAT'S IT
FOR MY YEARS OF LIVE ELECTION

00:00:12.342 --> 00:00:13.508
COVERAGE.

00:00:13.508 --> 00:00:16.560
SO, I'D LIKE TO TAKE A BRIEF
MOMENT BEFORE WE GO TO SAY THANK

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.320
YOU.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.580
AND ALSO THANK ME.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:22.860
(LAUGHTER)
COUNTING MY TIME ON THE DAILY

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.159
SHOW WITH JON DAILY AND THE
DAILY ZOO CREW, WE'VE BEEN

00:00:26.193 --> 00:00:30.364
GETTING TOGETHER WITH YOU LIKE
THIS SINCE 2000.

00:00:30.397 --> 00:00:35.002
WHO CAN FORGET THAT
ONE? BUSH V CHAD.

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:39.640
IF YOU'RE COUNTING, THAT'S 8
LIVE ELECTION SHOWS IN 14 YEARS.

00:00:39.673 --> 00:00:42.776
MAKES SENSE SINCE 14
DIVIDED BY 2 IS 8.

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.546
(LAUGHTER)
I HAVE SO MANY MEMORIES. MOSTLY

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:47.347
SHAPES AND COLORS.

00:00:47.381 --> 00:00:50.450
THERE'S BEEN A FAIR AMOUNT OF
DRINKING ALONG THE WAY.

00:00:50.484 --> 00:00:52.419
(LAUGHTER)
AS I LEAVE YOU FOR THE LAST

00:00:52.452 --> 00:00:54.621
TIME, I'D LIKE TO SHARE WHAT
I'VE LEARNED WITH FUTURE

00:00:54.655 --> 00:00:59.126
GENERATIONS AS WELL AS THE
ALIENS FROM ZAFRAX-5 WHO FIND

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:01.094
THIS SHOW ON THE GOLDEN
CYLINDERS LAUNCHED INTO SPACE

00:01:01.128 --> 00:01:03.297
MOMENTS BEFORE THE EARTH
EXPLODES.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.432
HI GUYS!

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:10.470
PLEASE REMEMBER THAT WHOEVER WON
THIS ELECTION, THE REPUBLICANS,

00:01:10.504 --> 00:01:12.673
SOMEONE IS ALWAYS RUNNING
AGAINST SOMEONE SOMEWHERE

00:01:12.706 --> 00:01:14.908
ELSE OR OTHER.

00:01:14.942 --> 00:01:17.344
ONE OF THEM WINS, THE OTHER
LOSES.

00:01:17.377 --> 00:01:18.846
SOME ARE TOO CLOSE TO CALL. YOU
MEAN TO CHECK BACK LATER

00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:22.583
AND FIND OUT WHO WON. BUT YOU
FORGET AND BY THE TIME YOU

00:01:22.616 --> 00:01:26.787
THINK TO DO IT, THERE'S ALREADY
ANOTHER ELECTION.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.991
I'M SURE THEY WRITE DOWN WHO THE
GOVERNOR OF NORTH DAKOTA IS

00:01:31.024 --> 00:01:31.491
SOMEWHERE.

00:01:31.525 --> 00:01:32.559
I COULDN'T FIND IT.

00:01:32.593 --> 00:01:34.895
BUT MOST OF US AREN'T GOING TO
NEED THAT INFORMATION.

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:37.798
WE GO ABOUT OUR LIVES SECURE IN
THE KNOWLEDGE THAT NORTH DAKOTA

00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:41.535
HAS A GOVERNOR OR EQUIVALENT.

00:01:41.568 --> 00:01:43.904
(LAUGHTER)
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I'LL ALWAYS

00:01:43.937 --> 00:01:45.105
REMEMBER?

00:01:45.138 --> 00:01:47.608
THE HARD WORKING MEN AND WOMEN
OF BROADCAST NEWS WHO TOLD US

00:01:47.641 --> 00:01:51.311
WHO WON THAT GOVERNOR'S RACE.

00:01:51.345 --> 00:01:54.882
MEN AND WOMEN LIKE -- STEPHEN
COLBERT.

00:01:54.915 --> 00:02:00.087
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YOU SEE, FOLKS,

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.257
TONIGHT MARKS A SORT OF FAREWELL
FOR ME.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.460
MAYBE SOME DAY YOU WILL SEE ME
ON TV AGAIN AND YOU WILL NUDGE

00:02:06.493 --> 00:02:08.762
YOUR SPOUSE AND SAY, HEY, I
REMEMBER THAT GUY.

00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:10.163
I USED TO LOVE HIM.

00:02:10.197 --> 00:02:13.667
MAYBE I WILL BUY HIS SLAP CHOP.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.572
SO THAT'S IT FOR "THE REPORT."

00:02:18.605 --> 00:02:22.976
I'LL END BY SAYING IT'S BEEN A
PLEASURE AND PRIVILEGE TO HAVE

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.915
BEEN WELCOMED INTO YOUR HOME
THESE LAST NINE YEARS.

00:02:27.948 --> 00:02:32.686
SO TO YOU AND YOURS, I'LL SAY A
FOND -- WHAT'S THAT?

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:34.288
ANOTHER MONTH AND A HALF OF
SHOWS?

00:02:34.321 --> 00:02:37.324
(LAUGHTER)
WELL, THEN, THIS WAS A LITTLE

00:02:37.357 --> 00:02:37.891
TOO DRAMATIC.

00:02:37.925 --> 00:02:39.893
(LAUGHTER)
I'M SORRY.

00:02:39.927 --> 00:02:40.694
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW!

00:02:40.727 --> 00:02:42.496
I'M EMBARRASSED!

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:43.530
WOW!
