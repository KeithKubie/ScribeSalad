BRADY FORREST: All right!

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.385
Welcome to Ignite!

00:00:07.385 --> 00:00:09.639
[CHEERING]

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:10.180
That's right.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.750
We've got some amazing
speakers here today.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.880
And just as with every
Ignite, each speaker

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.980
is going to get five
minutes on stage,

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.070
20 slides, 15 seconds a slide.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.070
These speakers have come
from all over the world

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.530
to speak to you today.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.650
And it's going to
be a great show.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.730
Please welcome up our
very next speaker.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.090
And actually, though,
you're in for a treat here.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.260
I've been bugging this woman
to translate this amazing story

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.560
into an Ignite talk
for three years.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.110
And this last spring
she owed me a favor.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.270
And thus you get this talk.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.640
Please welcome up
Tindie's Julia Grace.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.549
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:46.340
JULIA GRACE: Hello.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.740
So this is a story about how
the entire computer science

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.920
community changed during
one week in August 2010.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.590
So let's go back in time.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.740
At that period I
was a researcher

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.890
at the IBM Almaden Research
Center in a place far,

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.690
far away, San Jose, California.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.245
Now, at IBM I wrote
a lot of papers.

00:01:08.245 --> 00:01:11.280
And in those papers were
a lot of very complex

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.390
mathematical proofs.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.200
Because I like to
subject myself to pain.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.160
Now, luckily I had the office
down the hall from Ron Fagin.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.500
Now, Ron is one of the
most famous computer

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.980
theorists in the world.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.420
I'd often go to his office.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.750
And we'd talk about
a lot of my proofs.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.280
Now, in Ron's office
there was a chalkboard.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.260
And next to the chalkboard
with a lot of the proofs

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.570
were bills and checks.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.100
And on every single one of those
bills and checks was written,

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.500
"If it is proved P is
equal to NP by a date,"

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.750
then Ron would cash the check.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.120
So why are people betting
Ron all of this money

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.620
that P is equal to NP?

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.100
So this is one of the
most fundamental problems

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.560
in computer science.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.790
And it's more than just
an abstract math problem.

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.630
This problem will finally tell
us what problems computers can

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.850
solve and which ones they can't.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.720
So P is the set of
problems that are

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.400
very easy for
computers to solve.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.910
Think about simple math.

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.840
5 times 3, 15.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.300
We can do that fast,
so can computers.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.490
But NP is the set
of problems that

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.820
are much harder for
computers to solve.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.550
Now, it is generally assumed
that P does not equal NP.

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.420
But if P is equal to NP,
and these sets of numbers

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.430
are the same, then
the world as we

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.180
know it will be very different.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.560
Modern cryptography could
be broken very easily.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.420
And we would have to come up
with a whole body of research

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.450
in order to solve this.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.940
Now, this problem made its mass
debut in pop culture in 1995

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.150
when it appeared on
a "Simpsons" episode

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.450
where Homer was trying to
escape being around his in-laws,

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.380
so he went through a door that
went into another dimension.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.750
Now, there's more than
just fame on the line here.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.250
There's $1 million
if you can actually

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.900
prove that P is not equal to NP.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.990
Now, it's important to note that
this problem has been around

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.030
for a very long time.

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.600
This is apparently what people
did on computers in 1971.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.960
And this is when the
problem first came out.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.490
Now, if you're a
computer scientist,

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.880
you know that it takes
a long time for people

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.930
to solve problems like this.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.180
But this changed
on August 6, 2010.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.200
A researcher from HP Labs
came out with a proof.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.860
He sent it to all the scientists
working on the problem,

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.120
including Ron.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.850
But he also posted
it online to script.

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.800
Now, a few days
later, aggregators

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.810
like Slashdot and Hacker
News picked up on this.

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.720
Nerds all over the
world were going crazy.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.980
Somebody had finally proved it.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.960
So I wanted to know,
what did Ron think?

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.630
What did all those professional
computer scientists working

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:49.220
on this think?

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.510
So I go to Ron's office.

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.650
And he's eating a sandwich,
not this sandwich,

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.480
but a similar sandwich.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.620
And he says to me, Julia,
things like this take time.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.370
The proof was 100 pages.

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.630
And I said, Ron, Twitter
does not have time!

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.780
And then he looks at
me perplexed and says,

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.170
but how did you know
about this problem?

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.940
So by then, something happened
that had never happened before.

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.040
TechCrunch published real news.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.840
And suddenly they were talking
about P is equal to NP-- again,

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.020
something that had
never occurred.

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.300
So did he prove it?

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:38.780
So the answer is maybe,
but probably not.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.100
So like all things
in math and science,

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.060
he still believes
the proof holds.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.100
But the general
community believes

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:47.860
the proof does not hold.

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.250
But that's not the
point of the story.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.650
The point of the
story is that suddenly

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.360
all of these discussions that
used to go on in private email

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.910
groups, they're now
happening out in the open.

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:07.200
And then suddenly "The New York
Times" picks up on it as well.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.690
And researchers like Ron and
other people in this community

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.600
start issuing public
statements as "The New York

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.150
Times" comes knocking
on their door.

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.360
And they say things
like, we know

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.090
this is a very hard problem
and a very interesting problem.

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.590
But we didn't think
anybody really cared.

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.660
So the beautiful thing
that happened here

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.970
is that suddenly
a community that's

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.236
used to talking about
things in private

00:05:34.236 --> 00:05:39.510
comes crashing into modern day
Twitter, social media blogs,

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:41.910
and we all can learn
about the awesomeness that

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.850
is some of these very hard
computer science problems.

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.910
And so maybe the
future millionaire

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.280
is in the audience tonight.

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.780
Go out and solve P equals NP!

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.760
And now Brad is coming on stage.

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:04.589
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:06.630
BRAD YOUNGGREN: I'm going
to talk a bit about how

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.070
medical devices are going to
change the way health care is

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:12.285
delivered in the world
over the next five years.

00:06:12.285 --> 00:06:14.140
It's going to allow
people and empower them

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.520
to have a more active
role in their health care.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.360
It's kind of like Fitbit
Plus or something like that.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.840
So no longer are
we going to have

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.350
to worry about the safety
and efficacy of devices

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:26.494
that we have to interact
with in our lives.

00:06:26.494 --> 00:06:28.660
That thing on the left that
you attach to your body,

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:32.220
and it supposedly broke down fat
off your body while you slept.

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:34.910
Or the Fluoroscopy device
on the other image there,

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:36.900
where it was used
for shoe sizing.

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.810
Or do-it-yourself kits,
like this gentleman

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:41.580
here in China for 11
years did dialysis at home

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.879
because he did not have
access to medical devices.

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:45.920
So he actually figured
out how to do this at 1/10

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.770
the cost from his garage,
fascinating story.

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:50.550
But we want to move
beyond that now

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:52.660
and empower people with
real safe and accessible

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:53.890
medical devices.

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:56.190
Patient-centered health
care is where we're moving.

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:58.150
But really, this is
a bidirectional flow

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:01.240
of information between you, as
the patient, and your doctor.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.495
This will be facilitated
by medical devices that

00:07:03.495 --> 00:07:06.250
are developed or already on the
market that you could purchase

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:08.740
now or within the next
year to make it better.

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:11.670
Here's an example of
a 14-year-old kid who

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:15.990
developed a stethoscope with a
3D printer earlier last year.

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:20.060
Now, this allows you
to actually digitize

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:21.130
the sounds of your heart.

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:22.430
Why does that matter?

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:24.230
Well, there's usually a lub dub.

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:25.925
But if there's a
lub dub dub, what

00:07:25.925 --> 00:07:29.090
we call the S3 in medicine,
that's actually the earliest

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:31.850
predictor of congestive
heart failure you can have.

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:34.539
So no longer do you have to
measure weights and, if you

00:07:34.539 --> 00:07:36.580
start gaining weight, call
your provider and say,

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:37.800
I'm gaining weight.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:41.600
Now you can actually use this
on your own from your house

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.110
and communicate that data.

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:45.387
And then your provider can
increase your diuretics

00:07:45.387 --> 00:07:47.970
to lower your weight, which will
lower the cost of health care

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:49.840
and keep you out
of the hospital.

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.510
So this is a simple device.

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:53.044
But it is very powerful.

00:07:53.044 --> 00:07:54.710
CellScope's another
device that came out

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:56.160
in the last year and a half.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.980
This is a device that
allows you to look

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:01.440
at the eardrum of
your child at home.

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.530
Fever, ear ache,
where do you go?

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:04.720
You go to the ER, right?

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.010
Or the urgent care center.

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:08.977
Now you can look at it at
the comfort of your own home.

00:08:08.977 --> 00:08:10.560
It's actually a lot
more powerful now.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:11.980
Because not only can
you get the information

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:14.330
and interpret it yourself,
you could send that data

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:17.230
to an ENT doctor, who can
look at the data and say,

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:19.350
yes, it's red.

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:23.150
And they can potentially
prescribe medication.

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:26.240
There are 5 million visits in
the US alone for acute otitis

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.430
media ear infection, and
10 million prescriptions.

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:30.380
Imagine if those,
the number of visits,

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:32.419
we could decrease by
using telemedicine

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:35.960
for this one simple
problem that we deal with.

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:38.341
So AliveCor gets a lot of press.

00:08:38.341 --> 00:08:39.590
You may have heard about this.

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:41.580
It's a single ED
EKG casing that sits

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:43.760
on the back of your smartphone.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:46.574
It can detect abnormal rhythms,
such as atrial fibrillation--

00:08:46.574 --> 00:08:47.990
really important,
because that has

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:50.280
relevance in the
context of stroke.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:53.140
So this device actually
creates this data

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:55.660
set that could be
sent to the cloud.

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:58.840
And initially they
had a website where

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:00.870
providers can go on
and see the data.

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:02.890
So you could interact
with your physician

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:04.640
remotely about
what's actually going

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.070
on with the rhythm
of your heart.

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:07.486
And now those are
being integrated

00:09:07.486 --> 00:09:09.060
with electronic medical records.

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:12.120
The cost is already cheaper
than traditional devices

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:14.030
that you would have
to purchase if there's

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:16.480
a question of whether you
had an irregular heartbeat.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.020
It's $225.

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:20.135
You can actually get
that diagnosis made.

00:09:20.135 --> 00:09:21.260
And by the way, you own it.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.532
So you can continually use
that device down the road.

00:09:23.532 --> 00:09:25.990
Microfluidics-- you're going
to be hearing a lot about this

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:27.270
in the next five years.

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:29.865
It's essentially a
microscope on a chip.

00:09:29.865 --> 00:09:31.490
It's got a lot of
plumbing on the chip.

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:34.690
But it allows you to do cheap,
fast point-of-care diagnostics.

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:37.310
Now, that's traditionally
facing towards hospital care.

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:38.320
But you're going
to be able to do it

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:39.830
from the comfort
of your own home.

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:41.875
Cue is coming out
with a device that

00:09:41.875 --> 00:09:44.664
will allow you to test
for five different markers

00:09:44.664 --> 00:09:46.080
from the comfort
of your own home.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.640
That information
will be Bluetoothed

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:50.210
to your phone, where
you can make changes

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:52.050
on a day to day basis
based on the changes

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:53.290
in that information.

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:55.240
Let's do a quick example here.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:56.620
It's December.

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:58.480
And you have a fever,
cough, sore throat.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:59.605
You think you have the flu.

00:09:59.605 --> 00:10:01.350
You take the test
with the device.

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:03.310
And that device then
Bluetooths and says,

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:06.200
you have the flu, yes, notifies
your health care provider,

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.430
your physician, that in
fact you have the flu.

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:11.650
Then that physician orders
a prescription for you

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:14.990
for that medical problem that
is couriered to you somehow

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:16.780
by Postmates or
something like that.

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:18.520
And then it ends up back at
the comfort of your home.

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.090
And you actually
never left your couch.

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:21.560
This is important
for a couple reasons.

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:22.934
One, physicians
really don't want

00:10:22.934 --> 00:10:25.110
you to come to the
hospital with influenza.

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:26.160
We don't mind seeing you.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.850
But the problem is
that we don't want

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:29.516
you infecting everyone
else in the room.

00:10:29.516 --> 00:10:31.280
And that's the problem
with influenza.

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:34.330
So ultrasound
diagnostics are changing.

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:37.300
In terms of the form factors,
they're becoming much smaller.

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.967
And now we're getting a lot
of auto-diagnostic devices

00:10:39.967 --> 00:10:40.550
in the market.

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:42.425
So this will allow this
to actually be things

00:10:42.425 --> 00:10:44.280
that consumers can
purchase to keep them

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.696
from out of the hospital or
going to see their health care

00:10:46.696 --> 00:10:49.510
provider and still communicate
the same amount of data.

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:52.370
So at the end of the day,
what we're trying to do here

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:54.075
is create a set
of medical devices

00:10:54.075 --> 00:10:56.380
that you, as the
consumer, as the patient,

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:58.492
can be empowered to
increase your communication

00:10:58.492 --> 00:11:00.950
with your health care provider
to move it back to a cottage

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:03.700
industry where you actually
have a physical relationship

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:04.637
with your provider.

00:11:04.637 --> 00:11:05.970
You can actually talk with them.

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:08.360
So medical devices will help
facilitate that process.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.492
Thank you.

00:11:09.492 --> 00:11:11.872
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:17.108 --> 00:11:18.630
ADRIAN CATALAN: Hey, everyone.

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:19.465
I'm Adrian.

00:11:19.465 --> 00:11:21.650
I'm from Guatemala.

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:24.550
I'm the co-founder of a
mobile development studio.

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:26.890
And also, I work at a
university part time.

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:28.100
I'm very curious.

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:30.810
And I believe curiosity,
it's something natural

00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:32.460
for human beings.

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:34.260
We are naturally inquisitive.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.520
That's me a few years
ago about to experience

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.590
a flow of electrons
passing through my body

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:41.820
for the first time.

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:44.270
As it turns out, you get
a tingling sensation.

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:47.290
Well, I found out, experiment.

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:52.140
Have you ever seen something
and wondered, can I make that?

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:54.300
Or can I make it better?

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:57.230
The world around
us is made by us.

00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:58.640
It didn't just exist.

00:11:58.640 --> 00:11:59.580
We made it.

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:01.360
It's shaped by us.

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:05.250
I believe making is
natural for every one.

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:07.900
Maybe you have made
some food, some art,

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:10.200
grew a beautiful garden.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.590
In my case, I like
technology very much.

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:14.690
Because I think it's
a huge leverage.

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:19.460
It lets you build a lot
with very little resources.

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:21.480
That's why this is
a tale of making.

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:23.290
I've been teaching
computer science courses

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:24.840
since I was a 20-year-old.

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:29.150
I usually ask my students,
who taught you to ride a bike?

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:31.430
Answers include Mom, Dad.

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:36.230
Then I ask them, do
they use a blackboard?

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:37.820
They didn't.

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:39.735
We learned it by doing.

00:12:39.735 --> 00:12:42.120
And there's a sense
of pride in making,

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:45.390
even if it's something as
simple as linking an LED.

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:47.940
That's the [INAUDIBLE]
of the whole world.

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:50.150
The first time you
make this, you're

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:53.840
going to feel like,
I am Prometheus!

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:58.010
I wanted that for as much
people that I can reach.

00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:01.690
So in [INAUDIBLE], I started
a lab at Galileo University,

00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:02.545
in Guatemala.

00:13:02.545 --> 00:13:08.150
I wanted for our engineering
school students to be makers.

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:11.770
We started with warships on
Arduino and Raspberry Pi.

00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:14.050
And soon the projects arose.

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:16.630
That's a 3D-printed claw
controlled by the [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:19.240
motion built using JavaScript.

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:22.470
Yes, you can build robots using
JavaScript thanks to leverage

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:24.000
like Johnny 5.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.290
Robotics is no longer only
four Ph.D. researchers.

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:31.820
Any web developer can be a
robotics maker right away.

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:33.720
That's another project
using the Oculus Rift.

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:36.190
It's telepresence robot.

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:38.220
It uses web cams as its eyes.

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:43.170
You can see the video
remotely using the headset.

00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:44.930
When you are making,
you don't need

00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:48.710
to know exactly what you're
doing or why you're doing it.

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:52.080
You just need to tinker,
play with the technology,

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.870
push it to the edge,
and push yourself

00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:57.210
to the edge to see
what you're capable of.

00:13:57.210 --> 00:13:59.080
Starting it wasn't easy.

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:02.420
There were like five
Arduinos and 100 students

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:03.845
willing to be makers.

00:14:03.845 --> 00:14:06.730
But in time, the warships
proved their worthiness.

00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:08.590
And we got some funding.

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:13.180
Also, we got more
goals for reach.

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:16.040
So we started a program called
Engineering Kickstart to get

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:18.860
high school students
interested in technology.

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:20.760
It's a boot camp.

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:24.130
During three weeks,
we show them how

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:26.340
cool it is being an engineer.

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:28.040
Also, we're working
with children.

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:31.960
Sometimes prototyping boards
and soldering irons doesn't fit.

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:35.990
So you can make playdough
right in your kitchen.

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:39.020
A salty recipe conducts
electricity really well.

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:42.480
And a sweet recipe is
resistant to electric currents.

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:45.130
Put that together and
you've got a circuit.

00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:47.510
Also, we started
[INAUDIBLE] community

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:50.770
in Guatemala, a community
that's open for everyone.

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:53.120
So we got students
from high school,

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:55.650
from different universities
working side by side.

00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:57.470
We'd see some developers.

00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:59.080
This is not rocket science.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:00.570
Well, sometimes it is.

00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:02.210
That's a [INAUDIBLE]
rocket built

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:05.012
using plastic bottles
and a Raspberry Pi.

00:15:05.012 --> 00:15:06.720
We built it last month
at the conference.

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:09.370
And it flew like an angel.

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:14.660
Surprisingly, it also
landed very well.

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:15.860
This is not a recipe.

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:18.350
We are just learning
how to do this.

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:20.320
This is a work in progress.

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:23.610
We started with warships
then built some crazy ideas

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:26.280
as projects to get
some attention.

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:29.490
And now we're working
on [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:34.229
The world is inviting us to
play, to roll up our sleeves

00:15:34.229 --> 00:15:35.020
and make something.

00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:41.970
Being makers is something
that is natural for us.

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:45.730
This is passionate-based
learning.

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:48.230
With making, you can explore
different possibilities

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:50.430
and see what drives you.

00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:52.960
What do we really like?

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:55.240
Starting is not easy.

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:57.830
Making needs a lot
of persistence.

00:15:57.830 --> 00:15:59.600
But it's for every one.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.550
So go ahead and make something.

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:03.160
If you have a
master's technique,

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:06.760
share it at your local
maker's space or online.

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:10.030
If you're an educator,
these are exciting times.

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:14.250
Because you can be
a maker of makers.

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:16.780
That's my email and my Twitter.

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:19.200
We can use it to follow
the conversation.

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:22.340
I want to finish saying, let's
go and make something together.

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:23.470
Thank you.

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:25.970
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:35.810
DEAN PUTNEY: So a
couple years ago my mom

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:38.450
dropped this photo album,
a family photo album,

00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:40.110
into my lap, basically.

00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:41.760
And it was a
collection of photos

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:43.560
that my great
grandfather, Walter,

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:47.160
took when he was in World
War I in the German army.

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:48.980
And I fell in love
with it immediately.

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:50.480
It's an incredible collection.

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:51.970
It's got hundreds
of photos in it.

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:54.350
I think that this
is just fantastic.

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:57.120
It's got these great
photos of people sledding.

00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:00.470
And he's basically brought his
camera all around with him.

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:02.360
And I wanted to preserve it.

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.020
My family basically
put me in charge

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:09.000
of preserving it and
keeping it in good stead

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.569
and sharing it with the world.

00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:13.582
So I started to think
about some of my experience

00:17:13.582 --> 00:17:14.290
with photography.

00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:17.290
I'd been very interested in
photography for many years.

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:20.215
I took a lot of courses in
college about photography.

00:17:20.215 --> 00:17:23.040
And I had a real favorite
which was a two-part course

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:26.700
on the history of photography,
taught by Linda Benedict-Jones.

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:30.790
And Linda, she's a real expert
in fine art photography.

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:33.170
She basically started
the Polaroid collection

00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:34.480
and curated it for many years.

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:37.240
And now she's the curator of
the photography department

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:39.800
at the Carnegie Museum
of Art in Pittsburgh.

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:41.920
So I was reminded of
a lot of the things

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:44.510
that we talked about in Linda's
class, a lot of the photos

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:45.490
that we looked at.

00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:47.547
And I decided I should
call Linda up and see

00:17:47.547 --> 00:17:49.380
what she had to say
about how to preserve it

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:52.800
and how best to get it,
the artistic community,

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:53.830
interested in it.

00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:57.090
Unfortunately, that was a
little bit of a dead end.

00:17:57.090 --> 00:18:01.780
Linda said that the museum is
mostly interested in preserving

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:05.080
the works of fine artists,
well-known artists.

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:07.680
And nobody had ever
heard of Walter before.

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.845
But I still felt
that it really needed

00:18:09.845 --> 00:18:11.940
to belong in a
museum at some point.

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:13.665
But at the same
time I thought, I'll

00:18:13.665 --> 00:18:14.790
take a different direction.

00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:16.530
I'm an internet guy.

00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:18.520
What can I do with
these photos now?

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:21.040
So I started digitizing them
and sharing them online.

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:23.220
I took photos of all
the pages and made

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:26.120
sure that they made
sense in a Flickr album.

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:28.690
And then I looked for
a new target audience.

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:31.810
And I decided if I can't get
in touch with the artists yet,

00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:34.219
let's get in touch
with the history people

00:18:34.219 --> 00:18:36.260
who are going to be very
much interested in this.

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:37.730
And I put it on Reddit.

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:38.480
And they loved it.

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:39.813
They tore the whole album apart.

00:18:39.813 --> 00:18:41.810
They made extensive
detailed notes

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:45.410
on almost every photo in the
whole album, like 700 photos.

00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:48.470
They found all these
locations and places

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:49.800
that Walter had been.

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:52.890
And I actually went to this
cathedral in northern France

00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:54.970
and re-took his photo.

00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:58.240
And Walter had a really
interesting approach

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:01.660
to how he took photos.

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:04.190
And how you could see in
that last photo there,

00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:09.670
he was taking images
inside these cathedrals

00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:12.020
where the roof was
blown out, basically.

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:14.520
And I decided that
the thing to do

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:19.070
was to make a reproduction
of Walter's albums

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:21.620
so that you could see
the context of the war

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:24.000
and the context of all
the photos together.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.630
And what I did was I
went to Kickstarter.

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:33.390
And I kept Linda's
artistic community in mind

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:37.200
and kept the idea of making
a really high-quality album

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:37.700
in mind.

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:39.300
I set the goal pretty high.

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:43.560
Because I wanted to do
justice for Walter's photos,

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:45.697
make a really
excellent reproduction.

00:19:45.697 --> 00:19:47.530
And it turns out that
Kickstarter isn't just

00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:48.840
a crowdfunding platform.

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:50.590
It's a reputation platform, too.

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:52.600
And that's where I built
Walter's reputation

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:57.690
as an artist as well as an
historical value, basically.

00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:00.910
And I wound up getting in
touch with a lot of people

00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:03.810
through the Kickstarter
who reached out to me.

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:06.480
I did an interview with the
"Daily Mail" at like 4 o'clock

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:08.980
in the morning on, like, the
second day of this Kickstarter.

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:10.730
Because people are
watching Kickstarter

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:12.940
trying to find out what
these new things are

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:15.600
and trying to find out
about the next big thing

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:16.940
that's coming out.

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:20.090
So the project doubled its goal.

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:22.010
It raised $113,000.

00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:25.650
And I drove directly
into making the album

00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:28.580
as an art object
in itself, making

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:30.150
it as beautiful as possible.

00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:33.160
I used really thick
paper, nice printing.

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:38.210
And in January every one
received their books.

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:41.190
And they were just
totally surprised.

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:46.110
They were not expecting this
history book to be so nice.

00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:50.840
And I took a page out of "How
to Win Friends &amp; Influence

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:54.440
People," one of my favorite
books, where I basically kept

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:56.924
Linda in touch about
and up to date on what

00:20:56.924 --> 00:20:57.840
the project was doing.

00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.214
And I asked her
for a small favor

00:20:59.214 --> 00:21:01.690
to write the forward
for the book.

00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:04.360
And when I finished,
when it was printed,

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.620
I sent her a copy
as a thank you.

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:08.370
And all that hard work paid off.

00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:12.430
Because Linda called me up a
couple days later and said,

00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:15.750
can we put Walter's
photos in the museum?

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:21.160
So here they are,
beginning of this month.

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:25.250
Here they are in the
Carnegie Museum of Art.

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:27.320
And they did a beautiful
job setting it up.

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:30.910
And now Walter's photos
are put in a context

00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:34.980
of a real artist, where
he is recognized now.

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:36.850
And right down that
hallway on the left

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:40.400
is one of Monet's
paintings of water lilies.

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:41.238
Thank you.

00:21:41.238 --> 00:21:44.226
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:47.874 --> 00:21:50.040
BRADY FORREST: Our next
speaker was here-- actually,

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:52.450
our next speaker spoke
at the very first Ignite.

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:54.520
And he was at last
year's Ignite I/O,

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:56.960
where he talked about better
living through Bluetooth.

00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:59.300
I think this talk would
be called "Better living

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:02.080
through Kickstarter,"
or this segment.

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:05.630
Please welcome up
Seattle's Dan Shapiro.

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:07.830
DAN SHAPIRO: Thank you, Brady.

00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:10.722
So when I graduated college,
I told my friend, Kevin,

00:22:10.722 --> 00:22:11.930
I have an engineering degree.

00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:13.939
If I go to work for
a software company,

00:22:13.939 --> 00:22:15.980
put a bullet in my head,
put me out of my misery.

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:17.270
I want to make things.

00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:19.330
Fortunately, he didn't listen.

00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:21.870
And after 15 and 1/2
years building software,

00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:24.350
I decided last year
to take a breather,

00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:26.040
take a leave of absence
over the summer,

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:27.990
and spend some time
with the family.

00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:30.240
Well, I don't write code.

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:31.140
I'm a product guy.

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:31.990
I do a little bit.

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:34.650
But it's always amazed me that
the most modern programming

00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:36.700
languages are still
backwards-compatible

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:39.380
with the VT100 terminal.

00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:41.235
Where else is ASCII
the state of the art?

00:22:41.235 --> 00:22:42.610
I always thought,
shouldn't there

00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:44.880
be a way that programming
could be more expressive?

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:46.629
I had this idea running
around in my head.

00:22:46.629 --> 00:22:48.160
At the same time,
my four-year-olds

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:49.510
were getting into games.

00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:51.630
And I was faced with
the unpleasant decision

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:55.010
between the Candy Land school
of completely random luck

00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:58.240
and the Tic Tac Toe school
of trying to throw the game

00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:59.980
and hope your kids don't notice.

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:01.390
And I wanted something better.

00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:04.470
So I thought, OK, what is going
to entertain four-year-olds?

00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:05.990
Computer science.

00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:08.240
I had this notion,
kind of half-baked,

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:11.500
they were going to play code
cards and write a program.

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:12.930
I was going to be the computer.

00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:14.520
I was going to run the program.

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:17.450
And thus was born Robot
Turtles out of a PowerPoint

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:19.100
deck and art supplies.

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:20.039
My kids loved it.

00:23:20.039 --> 00:23:21.580
The first time we
played, my daughter

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:23.732
said, Daddy, I don't
like the walls.

00:23:23.732 --> 00:23:25.190
I said, what should
we do about it?

00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:27.970
She said, lasers!

00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:30.227
So it went like this
with my collaborators,

00:23:30.227 --> 00:23:31.060
developing the game.

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:33.518
At the same time, I was talking
with a crazy friend of mine

00:23:33.518 --> 00:23:35.980
who wanted to put his
family album on Kickstarter.

00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:37.540
We would chat every
night via Skype.

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:41.800
Of course, his project was
completely doomed to fail.

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:43.949
But I learned a lot
from our conversations.

00:23:43.949 --> 00:23:46.240
We talked about what I call
"the Curly rule," for those

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:47.698
of you who've seen
"City Slickers."

00:23:47.698 --> 00:23:49.640
It's that Kickstarters,
great Kickstarters,

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:53.030
are about one thing, one thing
you want to exist in the world.

00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:55.850
And when people want that
thing to exist with you,

00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:57.070
they succeed.

00:23:57.070 --> 00:24:00.250
We talked about what I think
of as the platonic ideal

00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:02.950
of Kickstarters and how to
find it, which is you back

00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:04.290
a whole bunch of stuff.

00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:07.700
And then you look for the common
threads, the platonic ideal,

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:10.360
of those successful campaigns.

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:13.510
Platonic ideal,
Vitruvian Kickstarter--

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:15.380
So for example,
great communications,

00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:19.222
regular updates, having a
story around what you do--

00:24:19.222 --> 00:24:20.680
and we were talking
about all this.

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:22.214
And I got jealous.

00:24:22.214 --> 00:24:24.380
I decided that I wanted to
do a Kickstarter, myself.

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:26.910
So I decided to get
a designer first.

00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:28.190
I found this guy in Indonesia.

00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:28.890
He was amazing.

00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:30.360
I was up till 3:00
AM every morning

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:32.870
polishing the art
for Robot Turtles.

00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:34.520
Then I had to figure
out manufacturing,

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:35.890
which is an exhausting process.

00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:38.200
I Googled "board
game manufacturers"

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:39.840
and called everybody
who came up.

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:42.000
Wound up with a
century-old company

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.230
called DeLano Services, who
did an amazing job printing it.

00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:46.380
Had to figure out shipping.

00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:47.860
Amazon's cheapest for domestic.

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:50.580
Did you know that
it costs $72 to send

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:52.330
three pounds of cardboard
to Tauranga, New

00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:55.730
Zealand. [MOUTH POPPING] So
having got all that sorted out,

00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:57.000
I had to set a goal.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.769
The key for me was
figuring out, what

00:24:58.769 --> 00:25:00.310
was the number I
would be happy with?

00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:03.430
I set it at $25,000, which I
thought I could probably hit.

00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:05.254
And I'd lose money.

00:25:05.254 --> 00:25:06.420
And I'd have some leftovers.

00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:07.750
But at least I'd have
something to give away

00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:09.630
at school auctions for
the rest of my life.

00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:11.425
So I put it up for $25,000.

00:25:11.425 --> 00:25:13.970
Ah, but how to let
people find out?

00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:15.130
I'm not proud of this.

00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:17.417
I've emailed 3,003
people in my life.

00:25:17.417 --> 00:25:19.000
And I emailed every
single one of them

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.120
to tell them about the
Kickstarter campaign.

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:24.230
Three told me never
to email them again.

00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:27.040
And then something
crazy happened.

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:30.760
The project fully funded
in the first five hours.

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:34.370
A day later, it hit $100,000.

00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:36.520
It went on to be the
most-backed board

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:39.080
game in Kickstarter history.

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:41.290
People asked me
how this happened.

00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:43.370
The best thing I can
explain is that this

00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:45.950
was something people
wanted to exist.

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:49.675
This was something, a board
game that teaches programming

00:25:49.675 --> 00:25:51.300
to preschoolers, that
wasn't out there.

00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:52.750
I talked to a friend in
the board game industry.

00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:54.940
She said, computer
programming is too esoteric.

00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:57.110
People don't want games
that require grownups.

00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:59.620
They want games where the
kids can go and entertain

00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:02.610
themselves in the
corners by themselves.

00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:05.450
Well, my Kickstarter
backers did want this.

00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:08.570
And they brought
it into existence.

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:09.950
So I listened to them.

00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:12.180
I resigned my
awesome job at Google

00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:15.470
and spent the next
few months delivering

00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:19.920
to 65 countries, three semi
truck loads of cardboard,

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:23.740
36 tons shipped
around the world.

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:25.750
I got outreach from
amazing board game

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:27.990
manufactures and
partnered with a company

00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:30.650
called ThinkFun, one of the
best in educational board games,

00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:33.500
whose CEO actually was the
brother of Dennis Ritchie,

00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:34.880
the guy who wrote
the programming

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:36.280
book I learned from.

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:38.850
And you can now
find it on Amazon.

00:26:38.850 --> 00:26:41.860
Next week it'll be in
Target stores nationwide.

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:44.360
And would you believe
it, a board game

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:47.070
about computer programming
was on the front page

00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:50.210
of "The New York Times."

00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:51.710
This thing needed to exist.

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:52.210
Thank you.

00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:53.740
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:55.510
And it was only by
putting it out there

00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:56.480
that I found that out.

00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:00.600
So I think I was on to something
back when I was in college.

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:02.830
It's really cool to
build things in software.

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:05.970
But making something you
can hold in your hands

00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:08.690
that the world wants, that
you can share with them,

00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:10.450
there's some real magic there.

00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:11.900
Thank you very much.

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:14.350
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:23.180
ARTURO JAMAICA: Right.

00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:23.687
Hi.

00:27:23.687 --> 00:27:24.770
My name is Arturo Jamaica.

00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:26.060
I'm from Mexico.

00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:28.760
And I'm going to talk to you
about how I hacked and stopped

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:32.460
a $9.3 million fraud in Mexico.

00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:35.190
So I live in a city
named Queretaro.

00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:37.870
That is two hours Mexico City.

00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:41.250
Myself, I have been doing
software development

00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:42.870
since the last 10 years.

00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:44.600
I am 24 years old.

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:48.420
I do a lot of stuff--
mobile, back-end

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:50.460
integrated with a lot of stuff.

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:54.530
And I started a company in
Mexico named Brounie, which

00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:59.000
the logo's a cupcake-- but
never mind-- where we usually

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.780
do apps for clients
for a lot of people.

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:03.480
We work, 12 people.

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:05.260
I am the biggest
guy in the company.

00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:06.720
We all are college students.

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:08.110
We don't have any funding.

00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:09.690
And we're working.

00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:12.710
One day I get to the newspaper,
the most important newspaper

00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:19.232
in my country, and I read this--
"congressman pay $9.3 million

00:28:19.232 --> 00:28:21.060
in order to get an app."

00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:22.350
For me it was crazy.

00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:26.430
Because I manage every month
to work with my students

00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:30.190
and pay the bills that I
have to do to run my company.

00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:35.170
This was compared
821 Angry Birds

00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:39.210
if you want to make the game
with the same amount of money.

00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:40.640
So I was really angered.

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:42.840
I was really thinking
about-- I was

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:45.240
losing a big deal that
we can make cheaper.

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:48.600
So it was like someone
putting a knife in my back

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:50.100
and telling me,
your country doesn't

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:51.750
want you to do
software for them.

00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:54.060
Because they wanted to
pass it to another people.

00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:59.330
Because all of our
business in Mexico

00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:00.650
is passing on corruption.

00:29:00.650 --> 00:29:06.040
So there was this idea of
one guy to turn it down.

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:10.240
So we decided to make the app
totally free using a contest.

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:14.850
So what I did first, I basically
hacked the congress website

00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:17.770
in order to scrap it and get out
all the information that they

00:29:17.770 --> 00:29:21.250
need and tell everyone
to use it freely

00:29:21.250 --> 00:29:23.660
so we can offer information.

00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:25.960
This was done in March of 2010.

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:28.360
Then I released on the
day of my birthday, which,

00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:31.820
instead of celebrating, I
coded the app in three days,

00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:34.550
in order to give it away and
give it open-source to everyone

00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:35.800
that can handle it.

00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:42.650
So you can use this app for
learning or for [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:42.650 --> 00:29:45.150
They made a contest in
order to clean their hands

00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:47.540
and don't seem very
bad about the press.

00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:49.830
And I got an iPad and $1,000.

00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:51.750
But for me, it was
very significant

00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:54.500
because I got attention
from a lot of people.

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:58.720
Because it was bigger news
that some guys in college-- I

00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:01.740
was 23 years old
then-- had the idea.

00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:06.830
We also got in TechCrunch all of
the fancy sites, all the news.

00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:11.560
So that came along for
us, a very good first time

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:14.180
in order to find
a lot of people.

00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:15.480
This wasn't done just by me.

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:17.870
Also, it was done by a
lot of people in Mexico,

00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:20.680
and also a lot of my team
that put work on this.

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:21.790
We don't charge a thing.

00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:24.510
We also make on the
top applications

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:26.780
on the Android and iOS devices.

00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:29.320
And it's all wielding
Google technology.

00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:31.350
So that was how I
hacked the congress

00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:33.090
and saved a lot of
money to my country.

00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:34.520
And this is my contact stuff.

00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:35.587
Thank you.

00:30:35.587 --> 00:30:38.022
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:42.837 --> 00:30:43.670
BRIAN USSERY: Hello.

00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:44.628
My name's Brian Ussery.

00:30:44.628 --> 00:30:49.510
And I'm a Top Contributor in
the Google Webmaster Help forum.

00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:53.360
This is my sixth Google
I/O. And I'm always

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:59.390
amazed by the number of
developers who aren't familiar

00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:03.600
with the Google product forums
or with the Top Contributor

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:04.350
program.

00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:06.910
So that's what I'm going
to be talking about today.

00:31:06.910 --> 00:31:09.570
When I say Google
product forums,

00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:12.450
I'm actually just talking
about the groups that

00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:18.000
provide technical support
for all of Google's products.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.140
And they're available any
time you have problems.

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:23.710
That should be one of
the absolute first places

00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:26.110
that you go to get help.

00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:30.790
So whenever you actually
go in the forums itself,

00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:34.050
you will find different badges.

00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:37.190
And the blue badges means
that the individual who

00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:39.350
posts, that they're
a Google employee.

00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:43.060
The yellow badge indicates that
it's a Rising Star, somebody

00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:45.960
who's a rising star in the
Top Contributor program.

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:49.250
And then there's the
Top Contributors.

00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:51.240
This is actually
an elite program.

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:56.590
It provides all types of
testing opportunities,

00:31:56.590 --> 00:31:59.225
Trusted Tester,
product knowledge,

00:31:59.225 --> 00:32:01.090
a number of insights.

00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:03.810
This is actually a question
that a first-time developer

00:32:03.810 --> 00:32:05.670
posted in the Chrome Help forum.

00:32:05.670 --> 00:32:08.380
And it was able
to actually cause

00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:13.330
Google to change the Fact
page in the Chrome Help forum.

00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:17.070
So personally, I enjoy
helping other people.

00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:21.320
I enjoy meeting with
other Top Contributors,

00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:24.750
coming out to California to go
to Google, going to the 'plex,

00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:28.262
testing out new
products, great swag.

00:32:28.262 --> 00:32:29.970
There are a number of
different benefits.

00:32:29.970 --> 00:32:33.100
This is kind of the
road to becoming a TC.

00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:34.850
First of all, you find
a forum that you're

00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:39.020
interested in that you have some
knowledge about, participate.

00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:40.530
Normally you're
contacted by Google.

00:32:40.530 --> 00:32:42.440
And you'll become a Rising Star.

00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:45.040
And then eventually you
become a Top Contributor.

00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:46.894
And these are some of
the Top Contributors.

00:32:46.894 --> 00:32:48.310
Believe it or not,
Google actually

00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:51.540
has 250 Help forums
for 25 products

00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:53.390
in 30 different languages.

00:32:53.390 --> 00:32:56.180
And the Top Contributors
are actually

00:32:56.180 --> 00:33:01.110
the most helpful and
best people in the forums

00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:03.440
in terms of answering
questions according to Google.

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:05.580
There are actually a
number of Top Contributors

00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:06.930
who are developers.

00:33:06.930 --> 00:33:08.390
So I'm not the only one.

00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:12.920
If you need help with
Chrome, Gmail, what have you,

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:16.280
there's a number of different
people who can help.

00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:20.320
Top Contributors are some of the
most helpful and active people

00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:21.360
in the Help forums.

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:23.530
They are always
providing support

00:33:23.530 --> 00:33:26.650
and helping to educate
and help other users

00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:30.590
to be the best that they
can with whatever product.

00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:32.660
They're very visible,
in this case,

00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:35.600
"in their pajamas" visible.

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:37.610
Whenever they're not
helping other people,

00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:40.240
you can find Top
Contributors hosting things

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:43.780
like Webmaster
Help Desk Hangouts.

00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:47.120
That is a live Hangout
that's every week.

00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:48.720
Top Contributors are technical.

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:51.630
They know the ins and
outs of Google products

00:33:51.630 --> 00:33:53.092
from a technical standpoint.

00:33:53.092 --> 00:33:54.550
And they're always
willing to help.

00:33:54.550 --> 00:33:56.174
A lot of times they're
actually working

00:33:56.174 --> 00:33:58.840
on creating additional
technical content

00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:01.340
to help other users
with the products.

00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:02.650
They're knowledgeable.

00:34:02.650 --> 00:34:05.170
Top Contributors are actually
trusted Google partners

00:34:05.170 --> 00:34:07.170
who connect
regularly with Google

00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:10.569
to stay in the know about the
latest products and updates.

00:34:17.350 --> 00:34:20.060
So why should you join?

00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:22.250
Being a Top Contributor
actually provides you

00:34:22.250 --> 00:34:27.370
with a number of opportunities
to increase your own product

00:34:27.370 --> 00:34:28.460
technical knowledge.

00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:31.980
And that's one of the most
beneficial things for me,

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:35.830
is knowing about what's going
to happen before it comes out.

00:34:35.830 --> 00:34:38.350
You also get to give
feedback on Google products,

00:34:38.350 --> 00:34:40.760
Trusted Tester opportunities.

00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:44.610
And that's something
that's also really unique.

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:50.550
Whenever you're a
Top Contributor,

00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:53.340
you actually team up with
a Google community manager.

00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:56.300
So you're constantly in
connection with them,

00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:58.010
talking with them.

00:34:58.010 --> 00:34:59.750
And that's a very
unique experience, too.

00:34:59.750 --> 00:35:02.020
Because there were years when
people would be like, well,

00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:02.895
how do I call Google?

00:35:02.895 --> 00:35:05.490
And I didn't have any idea.

00:35:05.490 --> 00:35:07.660
So one of the coolest
things about it,

00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:11.220
honestly, too, is you get
to help and inspire others.

00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:13.504
You get to help change
the world and make it

00:35:13.504 --> 00:35:14.670
a better place, if you will.

00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:17.830
You're actually answering
thousands of questions.

00:35:17.830 --> 00:35:20.200
And people constantly are
referring back to these.

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:22.650
But honestly, it's
also a lot of fun.

00:35:22.650 --> 00:35:25.050
This is actually a
picture from our TC Summit

00:35:25.050 --> 00:35:27.030
that was in Mountain
View last October.

00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:30.230
And Google flies everybody out
there from around the world.

00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:32.060
And it's just a lot of fun.

00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:35.390
So if you're interested in
becoming a Top Contributor

00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:37.710
or learning more about
the program, contact me.

00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:39.910
There are a number of Top
Contributors out here.

00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:41.956
And there are also a
number of Googlers.

00:35:41.956 --> 00:35:43.080
Feel free to ask any of us.

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:44.830
Thank you and have a good day.

00:35:44.830 --> 00:35:47.205
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:50.530 --> 00:35:53.240
BRADY FORREST: I would like
to apologize in advance

00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:56.370
for just how morbid
this next talk is

00:35:56.370 --> 00:35:58.350
and for the amount
of glee that you

00:35:58.350 --> 00:36:01.020
will see from this adult
version of Wednesday.

00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:02.700
Please welcome up
Danielle Leong.

00:36:05.799 --> 00:36:06.590
DANIELLE LEONG: Hi.

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:07.560
My name is Danielle.

00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:11.160
And today I'm going to talk to
you about forensic entomology,

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:13.252
which is the study
of the insects that

00:36:13.252 --> 00:36:15.430
eat you when you die.

00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:16.680
I hope none of you are hungry.

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:18.400
Because it's going
to be disgusting.

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:21.860
So a quick confession-- I
have photographic evidence

00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:24.190
that I have always been a nerd.

00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:24.870
So here I am.

00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:28.030
I actually interned at the San
Mateo County Mosquito Abatement

00:36:28.030 --> 00:36:28.530
lab.

00:36:28.530 --> 00:36:31.070
And I also went to CSI camp.

00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:32.120
It was totally a thing.

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:33.270
It was fantastic.

00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:36.160
You all missed out, because
you're no longer 17.

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:39.010
So there was this is
one time at CSI camp

00:36:39.010 --> 00:36:40.510
where I was sitting
in a lecture.

00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:42.801
And all of a sudden this man
comes out of the back room

00:36:42.801 --> 00:36:44.380
and shoots our
professor in the head.

00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:45.640
We're like, oh my god!

00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:47.450
Do we still have to
take the mid-term?

00:36:47.450 --> 00:36:49.130
The answer is yes, we did.

00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:52.260
But our professor gets up
off the ground and says,

00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:55.050
each one of you has been
a witness to a crime.

00:36:55.050 --> 00:36:56.890
How many shots were fired?

00:36:56.890 --> 00:36:58.300
What did the
assailant look like?

00:36:58.300 --> 00:36:59.130
What race was he?

00:36:59.130 --> 00:37:00.130
How heavy was he?

00:37:00.130 --> 00:37:03.280
And out of 200 students,
not a single one of us

00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:06.180
had the same answer as
the person next to us.

00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:08.420
So the moral of the story
is that eyewitnesses

00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:11.730
are incredibly unreliable,
unless you have Neil deGrasse

00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:12.790
Tyson as your witness.

00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:15.600
That man's word is God.

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:17.980
You should never,
ever rely on witnesses

00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:19.350
if you want to win your case.

00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:21.980
So forensic entomology
is incredibly important

00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:22.920
to police work.

00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:26.730
Because insects provide physical
evidence of time of death.

00:37:26.730 --> 00:37:28.730
It takes a specific amount
of time for an insect

00:37:28.730 --> 00:37:32.980
to get from egg, to larva,
to pupa, to an adult.

00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:37.120
And so since insects don't have
stretchy skin, as they grow,

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:37.850
they molt.

00:37:37.850 --> 00:37:40.209
Each one of these molts
is called an instar.

00:37:40.209 --> 00:37:42.000
Blow flies, for example,
have three instars

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.350
that they go through.

00:37:43.350 --> 00:37:46.905
And so if you can count how many
of each specific type of insect

00:37:46.905 --> 00:37:49.340
and each specific
instar are on a body,

00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:52.280
you can actually get a pretty
accurate time of death.

00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:54.860
So there are certain things
that can affect an insect's life

00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:55.370
cycle.

00:37:55.370 --> 00:37:57.950
For example, if the body's
in a barrel, if it's wet,

00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:59.130
if it's hot, if it's cold.

00:37:59.130 --> 00:38:03.040
All of these things can
either slow down or speed up

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:05.710
the growth cycle of an insect.

00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:08.370
Now, there are ways that
you can measure this.

00:38:08.370 --> 00:38:10.320
There are things called
body farms, which

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:12.630
are super creepy
laboratories where scientists

00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:15.550
can go and measure the effects
of these different types

00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:16.330
of variables.

00:38:16.330 --> 00:38:18.800
So there are just
bodies in car trunks

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:20.970
just hanging out in the field.

00:38:20.970 --> 00:38:23.920
So the first one was actually
in the University of Tennessee.

00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:25.919
Now, there are five
stages of decomposition.

00:38:25.919 --> 00:38:27.960
And each one of them comes
with their own insect.

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:30.220
The first one is initial decay.

00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:31.880
This happens immediately
when you die.

00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:33.469
Flies just come out of nowhere.

00:38:33.469 --> 00:38:34.760
I don't know how they find you.

00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:35.440
But they find you.

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:36.270
They will find you.

00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:38.680
And they will just start
laying eggs in your eyes

00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:42.050
and in your mouth and any other
kind of orifice they can find.

00:38:42.050 --> 00:38:43.806
And so when those
eggs hatch-- we're

00:38:43.806 --> 00:38:44.930
very familiar with maggots.

00:38:44.930 --> 00:38:46.410
Those are blow fly larvas.

00:38:46.410 --> 00:38:48.790
And this is also
how we get ants.

00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:51.855
So this is about three--
immediately after death,

00:38:51.855 --> 00:38:53.890
and till three days after.

00:38:53.890 --> 00:38:55.760
Next up we have putrefaction.

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:57.830
And this is when the
naturally-occurring bacteria

00:38:57.830 --> 00:39:00.050
and digestive
enzymes in your gut

00:39:00.050 --> 00:39:02.000
start to eat away
at your organs.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.436
And they release carbon dioxide.

00:39:03.436 --> 00:39:04.810
And they make you
start to bloat.

00:39:04.810 --> 00:39:07.550
This actually happens
at initial decay.

00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:10.310
But this is when you
get exceptionally puffy.

00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:11.420
So we have our maggots.

00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:14.370
They have gone through several
stages of their instars.

00:39:14.370 --> 00:39:16.980
We also have the appearance
of the carrion beetle

00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:18.750
as well as the rove beetle.

00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:20.070
And we also still have ants.

00:39:20.070 --> 00:39:21.570
Because your body's
still very soft.

00:39:21.570 --> 00:39:24.660
So they can chew away at
you and take you away.

00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:27.210
Next up is my
favorite stage of all,

00:39:27.210 --> 00:39:28.690
which is black putrefaction.

00:39:28.690 --> 00:39:31.320
And this is when
your body explodes.

00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:32.510
And it's black.

00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:33.690
And it's disgusting.

00:39:33.690 --> 00:39:34.350
And it smells.

00:39:34.350 --> 00:39:37.020
And this is when your neighbors
find out that you're dead.

00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:37.910
It's fantastic!

00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:39.330
It's the best one out there.

00:39:39.330 --> 00:39:42.050
So remember our blow flies, it
takes a specific amount of time

00:39:42.050 --> 00:39:43.020
from egg to larva.

00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:44.490
Now we have reached
the pupa stage.

00:39:44.490 --> 00:39:47.320
They're burrowing through the
carpet underneath your body.

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:50.970
We also have the appearance
of the black scavenger fly

00:39:50.970 --> 00:39:54.070
as well as our carrion
and our rove beetles.

00:39:54.070 --> 00:39:56.085
Next up we have
butyric fermentation.

00:39:56.085 --> 00:39:57.960
And this is when your
body starts to dry out.

00:39:57.960 --> 00:40:00.680
And it smells like cheese.

00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:02.160
I hope you're still hungry.

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:04.180
And this is because
of the butyric acid

00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:06.110
that your body is producing.

00:40:06.110 --> 00:40:08.970
So this is about 20 to
50 days after death.

00:40:08.970 --> 00:40:10.780
And with butyric
fermentation, you

00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:12.557
get the appearance
of the cheese fly.

00:40:12.557 --> 00:40:14.140
And the cheese fly
is my favorite fly.

00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:15.920
Because if I was a fly,
I would be a cheese fly.

00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:17.503
Because then you
could live in cheese.

00:40:17.503 --> 00:40:19.517
And honestly, who
doesn't want to do that?

00:40:19.517 --> 00:40:21.600
And we also have the
appearance of our skin beetle

00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:23.770
as well as our black
scavenger fly, as well,

00:40:23.770 --> 00:40:25.110
and our carrion beetles.

00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:28.130
Our last stage of
decomposition is dry decay.

00:40:28.130 --> 00:40:30.320
And it's pretty
self explanatory.

00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:31.380
Your body has exploded.

00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:32.796
There's not a whole
lot of fluids.

00:40:32.796 --> 00:40:33.540
It's dry.

00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:35.119
It does happen in humid weather.

00:40:35.119 --> 00:40:36.660
But it's not really
that interesting.

00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:39.860
It's mites and moths and
boring stuff like that.

00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:42.676
So a quick recap--
eyewitnesses are terrible.

00:40:42.676 --> 00:40:44.050
If you want to
win your case, you

00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:46.650
want to have as much physical
evidence as possible.

00:40:46.650 --> 00:40:49.750
Insects help provide physical
evidence of time of death.

00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:51.517
There are five stages
of decomposition.

00:40:51.517 --> 00:40:53.600
And each one of them comes
with their own insects,

00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:54.647
like the cheese fly.

00:40:54.647 --> 00:40:55.480
Thank you very much.

00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:57.825
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:02.452 --> 00:41:05.035
TIMOTHY SALO: My goodness, how
do you follow a talk like that?

00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:12.230
Two weeks ago I
submitted an essay

00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:14.420
that explained why I wanted
to come to Google I/O.

00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:16.230
Because I didn't have
a registration code.

00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:18.272
I explained how I wanted
to come and understand

00:41:18.272 --> 00:41:20.730
how Google products and services
would help create what I'm

00:41:20.730 --> 00:41:23.950
calling "the internet
of natural things."

00:41:23.950 --> 00:41:26.670
Next thing I knew, ReadWrite
gave me a registration code.

00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:29.630
So I engaged in a little
bit of essay reuse

00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:32.270
and submitted that
essay and said

00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:36.400
I wanted to explain how
Google ought to participate

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:40.650
in creating this
large scale, wide area

00:41:40.650 --> 00:41:42.830
collection of wireless
sensor networks.

00:41:42.830 --> 00:41:44.640
OK, it was a little
bit presumptuous.

00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:47.640
But it got me an
Ignite presentation.

00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:49.140
So why are these
things interesting?

00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:50.556
They're interesting
because I want

00:41:50.556 --> 00:41:53.200
to collect sensor data
from large, remote areas,

00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:57.040
like watershed-sized areas--
maybe hundreds or thousands

00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:58.280
of square miles.

00:41:58.280 --> 00:41:59.900
Why do I want that data?

00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:01.810
Hydrologists use that
data to, for example,

00:42:01.810 --> 00:42:04.760
create flood warnings
and flood forecasts.

00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:07.810
Floods are the most
deadly natural disaster

00:42:07.810 --> 00:42:09.840
in this country after heat.

00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:12.520
And of course, you need
that data in a big hurry.

00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:15.390
Better data, quicker data
means better forecasts,

00:42:15.390 --> 00:42:18.680
more lives saved, and
more property preserved.

00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:21.650
Also, 80% of our
fresh water resources

00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:24.530
originate in forested areas.

00:42:24.530 --> 00:42:28.440
In order to protect our
fresh water resources,

00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:31.900
we need to understand what's
happening in those areas.

00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:34.550
And of course, climate
change compels us.

00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:37.144
Climate change really drives
us to want to better understand

00:42:37.144 --> 00:42:38.810
these remote areas
so that we can better

00:42:38.810 --> 00:42:41.490
adapt to a changing environment.

00:42:41.490 --> 00:42:42.990
There is the problem,
small problem,

00:42:42.990 --> 00:42:45.210
of getting the data
out of these areas.

00:42:45.210 --> 00:42:46.730
It's the last
tens-of-miles problem.

00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:49.440
These areas are areas that don't
have common infrastructure,

00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:52.250
such as cellular service,
internet service.

00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:54.860
They don't even have
commercial electrical power.

00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:58.960
So one solution is use
radios to get these data out,

00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:01.740
such as the radios that are
used on police cars, taxicabs,

00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:05.230
and amateur radio operators.

00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:07.460
These radios, you do
have to deploy them.

00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:09.770
And they're really slow, at
least by today's standards.

00:43:09.770 --> 00:43:10.644
You can get data out.

00:43:10.644 --> 00:43:13.586
It may be 9.6
kilobits per second.

00:43:13.586 --> 00:43:15.460
But amateur radio
operators are experimenting

00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:16.800
with other technologies.

00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:19.210
Throughout the world, hundreds
of amateur radio operators

00:43:19.210 --> 00:43:25.490
have attached a radio and a
camera to weather balloons

00:43:25.490 --> 00:43:26.540
and released them.

00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:30.030
They rise to 100,000 feet
and take beautiful pictures.

00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:32.850
At 100,000 feet, when
these balloons burst,

00:43:32.850 --> 00:43:33.790
the sky is black.

00:43:33.790 --> 00:43:35.880
And you can even see the
curvature of the Earth.

00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:37.590
And of course, since
these have radios

00:43:37.590 --> 00:43:39.410
that are broadcasting
their location,

00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:41.210
the amateurs can
chase after them

00:43:41.210 --> 00:43:43.540
and recover them and
get neat pictures.

00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:45.800
Since the 1960s
other radio amateurs

00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:49.010
have been creating
communication satellites that

00:43:49.010 --> 00:43:51.190
allow amateurs to
communicate with each other

00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:53.670
through low earth
orbit satellites.

00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:56.070
And this has created a worldwide
network of amateur radio

00:43:56.070 --> 00:43:58.770
operators who can
provide ground stations,

00:43:58.770 --> 00:44:00.960
ground support, and
manage these satellites.

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:03.355
In fact, there's a small
satellite from NASA--

00:44:03.355 --> 00:44:04.730
which isn't an
amateur satellite,

00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:08.770
but it's similar-- that is
using these same amateur radio

00:44:08.770 --> 00:44:11.190
operators to collect
telemetry for NASA,

00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:13.385
a low-cost, free ground station.

00:44:13.385 --> 00:44:16.260
Oh, and by the way, that
was a picture of PhoneSat.

00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:17.560
And you guessed it.

00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:21.090
It's driven-- its main
computer is an Android phone.

00:44:21.090 --> 00:44:24.860
There's the proof-of-concept
project by NASA.

00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:27.650
So in order to create
these things, in order

00:44:27.650 --> 00:44:29.420
to create this internet
of natural things,

00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:30.790
we need some collaborations.

00:44:30.790 --> 00:44:32.420
And Google has just
the projects that I

00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:33.660
think ought to participate.

00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:36.700
You've all heard of Project
Loon, the balloon internet

00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:39.910
project by Google that will
provide internet service

00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:42.420
to remote areas with
high-altitude balloons are

00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:43.551
circulating the Earth.

00:44:43.551 --> 00:44:46.050
I'd like for those balloons
also to provide internet service

00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:48.680
to remote sensors, to
this remote internet

00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:50.540
of natural things.

00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:52.010
And if you've read
the newspaper,

00:44:52.010 --> 00:44:54.790
Google has promised, apparently,
according to news reports,

00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:57.680
to invest billions of
dollars in a constellation

00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:01.792
of low earth-orbit
satellites that

00:45:01.792 --> 00:45:03.650
will also provide
internet service.

00:45:03.650 --> 00:45:07.510
I think that Google ought to
use these satellites to connect

00:45:07.510 --> 00:45:10.415
my networks in remote areas to
provide internet service so we

00:45:10.415 --> 00:45:15.270
can get those hydrologic data
quicker from more remote areas.

00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:17.670
And it's not just hydrologists
that want these data.

00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:18.900
Meteorologists want it.

00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:20.030
Researchers want it.

00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:21.424
And I think Google wants it.

00:45:21.424 --> 00:45:23.340
After all, Google,
according to press reports,

00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:25.173
has recently entered
into an agreement where

00:45:25.173 --> 00:45:29.610
they will make climate change
available over the web.

00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:32.170
What better place to
deliver this sensor data?

00:45:32.170 --> 00:45:36.040
And collaborations are required
to create this project,

00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:38.250
to wire the internet,
and to wire the planet.

00:45:38.250 --> 00:45:40.970
And I think the particularly
interesting collaborations

00:45:40.970 --> 00:45:43.940
are, I think, that Google-- if
I might say presumptuously--

00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:47.290
I would like to see Google
Project Loon and the LEO

00:45:47.290 --> 00:45:49.630
satellites collaborate with
amateur radio operators.

00:45:49.630 --> 00:45:53.040
Amateur radio operators
get new toys to play with.

00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:55.489
And Google gets free
ground station services

00:45:55.489 --> 00:45:57.280
throughout the globe
that will provide them

00:45:57.280 --> 00:45:59.525
telemetry and
management services.

00:45:59.525 --> 00:46:01.900
And of course, not only will
this project wire the planet

00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:03.560
and save the Earth,
it's also part

00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:05.050
of my dissertation research.

00:46:05.050 --> 00:46:07.120
And so maybe it'll
help me graduate, too.

00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:08.320
Thank you.

00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:11.296
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:16.525 --> 00:46:18.650
BRADY FORREST: We're down
to our last two speakers.

00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:21.560
And this next speaker is what
I would call a web theorist.

00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:23.495
Please welcome up Kevin Marks.

00:46:30.410 --> 00:46:31.800
KEVIN MARKS: So
in ancient Greece

00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:35.210
there was a road called
the Way of Miracles

00:46:35.210 --> 00:46:37.910
that went from
Athens to Eleusis.

00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:42.250
People would go there to get
to the holy places in Greece.

00:46:42.250 --> 00:46:44.686
And on that road was a
man called Procrustes,

00:46:44.686 --> 00:46:46.310
who would get people
to stay in his bed

00:46:46.310 --> 00:46:48.169
at night, except that
if they didn't fit,

00:46:48.169 --> 00:46:49.960
he'd cut off their feet
or stretch them out

00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:52.140
on the rack to make them fit.

00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:55.880
And my point is that we
tend to do this in computing

00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:57.230
quite a lot, too.

00:46:57.230 --> 00:46:59.680
If you're younger than
me, you may not remember.

00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:02.350
But we used to have to
use file names like this

00:47:02.350 --> 00:47:05.211
and compress every thought
we had into 8.3 characters.

00:47:05.211 --> 00:47:06.960
And the three were
predefined by the apps.

00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:09.370
So we really had eight.

00:47:09.370 --> 00:47:11.500
But things get better over time.

00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:15.300
Now in Runescape
you can have things

00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:18.220
that are worth up to
2.147 billion gold coins.

00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:22.700
Because they used a java.lang to
store the amount of gold coins

00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:25.510
something could be worth.

00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:27.680
If you have a
database of customers

00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:30.302
that has zip codes
in it, you may

00:47:30.302 --> 00:47:32.385
wonder why you have so
many users in Beverly Hills

00:47:32.385 --> 00:47:34.212
and Schenectady.

00:47:34.212 --> 00:47:36.420
Because you ask every customer
to fill in a zip code.

00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:41.037
But there seem to be more than
the population would predict.

00:47:41.037 --> 00:47:42.620
Because these are
the zip codes people

00:47:42.620 --> 00:47:43.800
use when they're lying to you.

00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:45.140
Or they don't have a
zip code because they

00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:46.370
come from another country.

00:47:46.370 --> 00:47:49.739
And so by forcing them to put
something in the database,

00:47:49.739 --> 00:47:51.280
you're forcing them
to make something

00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:54.000
up and destroy your data.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:57.584
Another example here--
this is a database

00:47:57.584 --> 00:47:59.000
that's asking you
for your gender.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.166
And the programmer clearly
wanted you to use one bit

00:48:01.166 --> 00:48:02.110
and then said, oh, OK.

00:48:02.110 --> 00:48:05.294
You can be other or decline
to state if you really insist.

00:48:05.294 --> 00:48:06.210
And this is a problem.

00:48:06.210 --> 00:48:07.866
Because gender isn't one bit.

00:48:07.866 --> 00:48:09.990
It's more of an essay
question for a lot of people.

00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:12.250
There's a site called
Genderfork, which is explicitly

00:48:12.250 --> 00:48:16.280
about people discussing gender
and how they feel about it

00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:19.120
and how it makes them
interact with others.

00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:22.480
It's very hard to fit
that into one bit.

00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:24.280
So databases are
part of the problem.

00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:25.780
I don't need to
recite this cartoon.

00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:26.740
You've all seen it.

00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:29.780
But databases by
their very nature

00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:32.790
force us to think of
the world as data,

00:48:32.790 --> 00:48:35.730
not as the world itself.

00:48:35.730 --> 00:48:37.550
But we put the databases first.

00:48:37.550 --> 00:48:39.420
Object orientation
can be bad, too.

00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:41.050
If you [INAUDIBLE]
inherits, you end up

00:48:41.050 --> 00:48:43.720
having volcanoes that
have fax numbers.

00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:47.620
Because it seemed logical
that places had fax numbers.

00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:51.240
So it's very hard to
get this modeling right.

00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:54.250
XML was an attempt to do better,
to let you construct arbitrary

00:48:54.250 --> 00:48:56.312
documents that
contained other things.

00:48:56.312 --> 00:48:58.770
But they kept the Procrustean
thing by making it draconian.

00:48:58.770 --> 00:49:00.790
So if you made a
mistake, that was it.

00:49:00.790 --> 00:49:01.980
The processing would stop.

00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:03.250
And you had to throw it out.

00:49:03.250 --> 00:49:06.300
Whereas HTML was very
accepting of areas and let

00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:08.490
you produce large
documents with it.

00:49:08.490 --> 00:49:10.310
Anything in it took
off, took over the web.

00:49:10.310 --> 00:49:14.350
And XML is sort of petering
out on the sidelines.

00:49:14.350 --> 00:49:15.850
But what this meant
was you then had

00:49:15.850 --> 00:49:18.200
to try and make sense
for these HTML, which

00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:20.800
is where we got the
idea of big data.

00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:22.480
But it's not really
about big data.

00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:23.510
It's about messy data.

00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:25.970
It's about data that is
produced by people as text

00:49:25.970 --> 00:49:28.240
as representations of
things that don't actually

00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:29.600
fit into the databases.

00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:31.180
So what do we do?

00:49:31.180 --> 00:49:33.700
We come up with
techniques like MapReduce,

00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:36.610
where you take all this
messy data on the left

00:49:36.610 --> 00:49:39.120
and squeeze it through
the Procrustean map

00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:41.720
and then shuffle it and end up
with the database on the right,

00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:43.676
which looks nice and orderly.

00:49:43.676 --> 00:49:46.300
But in fact, you've applied that
Procrustean process on the way

00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:48.620
in.

00:49:48.620 --> 00:49:50.100
This is a well-known
list of things

00:49:50.100 --> 00:49:51.550
that people get
wrong about names.

00:49:51.550 --> 00:49:53.650
It really won't
fit into an Ignite.

00:49:53.650 --> 00:49:56.530
But there are many
of them there.

00:49:56.530 --> 00:49:59.715
And then what you do is you
write a MapReduce to try

00:49:59.715 --> 00:50:02.160
and find what real names
are across the web,

00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:04.310
which is how we end up
with Google+ nymwars,

00:50:04.310 --> 00:50:06.836
where the rule is not,
this has to be your name,

00:50:06.836 --> 00:50:09.210
this has to be a name that
fits the algorithm that thinks

00:50:09.210 --> 00:50:10.610
it's a name.

00:50:10.610 --> 00:50:13.940
And that's another example
of this Procrustean squeezing

00:50:13.940 --> 00:50:17.010
of the world into space.

00:50:17.010 --> 00:50:20.730
The biggest problem, though,
is plausibility of stories.

00:50:20.730 --> 00:50:25.300
We tend to construct stories
and prefer the stories

00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:27.940
and then retell them
over time, which

00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:30.510
is another Procrustean
try for ourselves.

00:50:30.510 --> 00:50:32.060
Because Procrustes
never existed.

00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:34.540
But yet this 3,000-year-old
story about a guy who cuts

00:50:34.540 --> 00:50:37.240
people's feet off on the road
between Athens and Eleusis is

00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:40.330
so compelling that I'm still
using it as a metaphor 3,000

00:50:40.330 --> 00:50:40.880
years later.

00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:43.230
And people have been doing
this for all that time.

00:50:43.230 --> 00:50:45.070
So the real
challenge is if we're

00:50:45.070 --> 00:50:48.400
going to build
standards and databases,

00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:51.120
remember that they're
documentation, not legislation.

00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:54.890
Make sure that you can
actually reproducibly prove

00:50:54.890 --> 00:50:58.930
and s your working while
you're doing what you're doing,

00:50:58.930 --> 00:51:00.630
document an empirical process.

00:51:00.630 --> 00:51:02.660
And these were a
couple of the standards

00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:04.500
that I've worked
on that try really

00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:07.080
hard to document every piece
of the process along the way

00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:11.200
and have an empirical way
of deciding what to use.

00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:13.117
Thank you.

00:51:13.117 --> 00:51:15.450
BRADY FORREST: Well, thank
you very much for coming out.

00:51:15.450 --> 00:51:17.950
I hope to see you
again next year,

00:51:17.950 --> 00:51:19.960
doing Ignite in your hometown.

00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:20.460
Thank you.

00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:21.060
I'm Brady.

00:51:21.060 --> 00:51:24.110
