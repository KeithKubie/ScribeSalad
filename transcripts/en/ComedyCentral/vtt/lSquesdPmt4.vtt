My comedian peers they told me 

00:00:03.135 --> 00:00:05.571
"Hey, man, professionals,

00:00:05.604 --> 00:00:08.107
they don't sing,
they tell the jokes."

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.978
And I was just going onstage
just singing Montell Jordan.

00:00:12.011 --> 00:00:14.647
That was my thing.
That was my comedy.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.682
And they were like,
"Hey, as, you know,

00:00:16.715 --> 00:00:21.120
professional comedians,
that's not how we do it."

00:00:21.153 --> 00:00:22.555
So I was like, cool, all right.

00:00:22.588 --> 00:00:24.390
I'll focus
on the written material,

00:00:24.423 --> 00:00:27.393
the spoken joke, whatever.

00:00:27.426 --> 00:00:28.661
But I felt like I was,
you know,

00:00:28.694 --> 00:00:30.063
putting my superpower away.

00:00:30.096 --> 00:00:31.597
That's like telling Tyler Perry,

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.467
"No more dresses, dog."

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.702
But then comes the "Comedy Jam."

00:00:36.735 --> 00:00:41.274
An opportunity for me,
James Davis,

00:00:41.307 --> 00:00:44.544
to go back to his roots.
[cheers and applause]

00:00:44.577 --> 00:00:46.913
So, tonight,
ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:46.946 --> 00:00:48.915
if you guys are ready,
I'm ready.
