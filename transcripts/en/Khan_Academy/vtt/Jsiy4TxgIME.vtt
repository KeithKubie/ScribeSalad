00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.322
In this video, I want to give
you the basics of trigonometry.

00:00:05.322 --> 00:00:08.334
And it sounds like a
very complicated topic,

00:00:08.334 --> 00:00:10.000
but you're going to
see that it's really

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.980
just the study of the ratios
of sides of triangles.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.550
The "trig" part of trigonometry
literally means triangle.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.860
And the "metry" part
literally means measure.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.810
So let me just give
you some examples here.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.350
And I think it'll make
everything pretty clear.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:27.970
So let me draw some
right triangles.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.580
Let me just draw
one right triangle.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.325
So this is a right triangle.

00:00:31.325 --> 00:00:33.460
And when I say it's
a right triangle,

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.020
it's because one of the
angles here is 90 degrees.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.505
This right here
is a right angle.

00:00:42.505 --> 00:00:47.830
It is equal to 90 degrees.

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.020
And we'll talk about
other ways to show

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.992
the magnitude of angles
in future videos.

00:00:52.992 --> 00:00:54.200
So we have a 90-degree angle.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.190
It's a right triangle.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.810
And let me put some
lengths to the sides here.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.330
So this side over
here is maybe 3.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.970
This height right
over there is 3.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.120
Maybe the base of the
triangle right over here is 4.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:13.960
And then the hypotenuse of
the triangle over here is 5.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.610
You only have a hypotenuse
when you have a right triangle.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.130
It is the side opposite
the right angle.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.080
And it is the longest
side of a right triangle.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.280
So that right there
is the hypotenuse.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.650
You probably learned that
already from geometry.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.250
And you can verify that this
right triangle, the sides

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:32.790
work out.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.800
We know from the
Pythagorean theorem

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.550
that 3 squared
plus 4 squared has

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.900
got to be equal to the
length of the longest side,

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.570
the length of the hypotenuse
squared, is equal to 5 squared.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.830
So you can verify
that this works out.

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.569
This satisfies the
Pythagorean theorem.

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:52.860
Now, with that out of the
way, let's learn a little bit

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.930
of trigonometry.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.627
So the core functions
of trigonometry--

00:01:57.627 --> 00:01:59.210
we're going to learn
a little bit more

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.310
about what these functions mean.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.220
There is the sine function.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.680
There is the cosine function.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.789
And there is the
tangent function.

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.730
And you write S-I-N,
C-O-S, and tan for short.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.930
And these really just specify--
for any angle in this triangle,

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.692
it'll specify the
ratios of certain sides.

00:02:22.692 --> 00:02:24.150
So let me just
write something out.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.733
And this is a little
bit of a mnemonic

00:02:25.733 --> 00:02:27.640
here, so something just
to help you remember

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.957
the definitions of
these functions.

00:02:29.957 --> 00:02:31.540
But I'm going to
write down something.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:39.437
It's called soh cah toa.

00:02:39.437 --> 00:02:41.770
And you'll be amazed how far
this mnemonic will take you

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.120
in trigonometry.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.620
So we have soh cah toa.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.840
And what this tells
us-- soh tells us

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.748
that sine is equal to
opposite over hypotenuse.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.910
It's telling us-- and this won't
make a lot of sense just yet.

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.600
I'll do it a little bit
more detail in a second.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.030
And then cosine is equal to
adjacent over hypotenuse.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.355
And then you finally
have tangent.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.010
Tangent is equal to
opposite over adjacent.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.510
So you're probably
saying, hey, Sal.

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.870
What is all this opposite,
hypotenuse, adjacent?

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.105
What are we talking about?

00:03:27.105 --> 00:03:30.250
Well, let's take an angle here.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.920
Let's say that this
angle right over here

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.080
is theta, between
the side of length 4

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.580
and the side of length 5.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.430
This angle right here is theta.

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.030
So let's figure out
what the sine of theta,

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.920
the cosine of theta, and what
the tangent of theta are.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.230
So if we want to first
focus on the sine of theta,

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.740
we just have to
remember soh cah toa.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.130
Sine is opposite
over hypotenuse.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.170
So sine of theta is
equal to the opposite.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.890
So what's the opposite
side to the angle?

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.840
So this is our angle right here.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.080
The opposite side, so
not one of the sides

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.770
that are kind of
adjacent to the angle.

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.160
The opposite side is the 3.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.709
It's opening onto that 3.

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.089
So the opposite side is 3.

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:21.564
And then what's the hypotenuse?

00:04:21.564 --> 00:04:22.480
Well, we already know.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.150
The hypotenuse here is 5.

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.185
So it's 3 over 5.

00:04:27.185 --> 00:04:28.569
The sine of theta is 3/5.

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:30.610
So if someone says, hey,
what's the sine of that?

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.059
It's 3/5.

00:04:32.059 --> 00:04:33.600
And I'm going to
show you in a second

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.970
that if this angle
is a certain angle,

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.840
it's always going to be 3/5.

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.810
The ratio of the opposite
to the hypotenuse

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.850
is always going to be the same,
even if the actual triangle

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.754
were a larger triangle
or a smaller one.

00:04:45.754 --> 00:04:47.170
So I'll show you
that in a second.

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.128
But let's go through all
of the trig functions.

00:04:49.128 --> 00:04:54.030
Let's think about what
the cosine of theta is.

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.260
Cosine is adjacent
over hypotenuse.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:58.310
So remember.

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:59.880
Let me label them.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.310
We already figured out that
the 3 was the opposite side.

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:04.730
This is the opposite side.

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.740
And only when we're
talking about this angle.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.240
When you talk about this angle,
this side is opposite to it.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.460
When you talk about this angle,
this 4 side is adjacent to it.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.160
It's one of the sides
that kind of make up,

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.940
that kind of form
the vertex here.

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.050
So this right here
is an adjacent side.

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.520
And I want to be very clear.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.310
This only applies to this angle.

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:27.810
If we were talking
about that angle,

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.640
then this green side
would be opposite

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.520
and this yellow side
would be adjacent.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.320
But we're just focusing on
this angle right over here.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.380
So cosine of this angle--
we care about adjacent.

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.970
Well, the adjacent side
to this angle is 4.

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.880
So it is adjacent
over the hypotenuse.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.690
It's the adjacent, which is
4, over the hypotenuse-- 4/5.

00:05:51.224 --> 00:05:52.265
Now let's do the tangent.

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:59.640
The tangent of theta,
opposite over adjacent.

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.430
The opposite side is 3.

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:05.754
What is the adjacent side?

00:06:05.754 --> 00:06:06.920
We already figured that out.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.540
The adjacent side is 4.

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.720
So knowing the sides
of this right triangle,

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.810
we were able to figure
out the major trig ratios.

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.710
And we'll see there
are other trig ratios,

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:21.510
but they can all be derived
from these three basic trig

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:22.750
functions.

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.000
Now, let's think about another
angle in this triangle.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.190
And I'll redraw it just
because my triangle

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:28.800
is getting a little bit messy.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.540
So let's redraw the
exact same triangle.

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:36.620
And once again, the
lengths of this triangle

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:41.290
are we have length 4 there,
we have length 3 there,

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:43.370
and we have length 5 there.

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.370
The last example,
we used this theta.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:53.450
But let's do another
angle up here.

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:55.160
And let's call this
angle-- I don't know.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.080
I'll think of something,
a random Greek letter.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.750
So let's say it's psi.

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:01.210
I know it's a
little bit bizarre.

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:02.501
Theta is what you normally use.

00:07:02.501 --> 00:07:04.487
But since I already used
theta, let's use psi.

00:07:04.487 --> 00:07:06.570
Actually, instead of psi,
let me just simplify it.

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:09.990
Let me call this angle x.

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:12.920
So let's figure out the trig
functions for that angle x.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:17.830
So we have sine of x is
going to be equal to what.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:20.820
Well, sine is opposite
over hypotenuse.

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.790
So what side is opposite to x?

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:27.170
Well, it opens onto this 4.

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:29.330
So in this context, this
is now the opposite.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:37.410
Remember, 4 was adjacent to this
theta, but it's opposite to x.

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:40.412
So it's going to be 4 over--
now, what's the hypotenuse?

00:07:40.412 --> 00:07:41.870
Well, the hypotenuse
is going to be

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:44.340
the same regardless of
which angle you pick.

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:46.860
So the hypotenuse is
now going to be 5.

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:48.589
So it's 4/5.

00:07:48.589 --> 00:07:49.630
Now let's do another one.

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:54.750
What is the cosine of x?

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:57.450
So cosine is adjacent
over hypotenuse.

00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:59.127
What side is adjacent to x?

00:07:59.127 --> 00:08:00.210
That's not the hypotenuse.

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:01.940
You have the hypotenuse here.

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:04.920
Well, the 3 side-- it's
one of the sides that

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.960
forms the vertex that x is at,
and it's not the hypotenuse.

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.990
So this is the adjacent side.

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:10.960
That is adjacent.

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:14.000
So it's equal to 3
over the hypotenuse.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.550
The hypotenuse is 5.

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:19.630
And then finally, the tangent.

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:22.200
We want to figure
out the tangent of x.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.330
Tangent is opposite
over adjacent.

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:29.330
Soh cah toa-- tangent is
opposite over adjacent.

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:32.280
The opposite side is 4.

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:34.730
I want to do it in
that blue color.

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:42.929
The opposite side is 4,
and the adjacent side is 3.

00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:43.820
And we're done.

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:46.230
In the next video, I'll do a
ton of more examples of this

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:48.122
just so that we really
get a feel for it.

00:08:48.122 --> 00:08:49.580
But I'll leave you
thinking of what

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:52.650
happens when these angles
start to approach 90 degrees,

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:54.880
or how could they even get
larger than 90 degrees.

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.379
And what we're going to see is
that this definition, the soh

00:08:57.379 --> 00:08:59.900
cah toa definition, takes us
a long way for angles that

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:04.000
are between 0 and 90 degrees, or
that are less than 90 degrees.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.730
But they kind of start to mess
up really at the boundaries.

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:08.938
And we're going to introduce

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:14.040
for finding the sine,

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:15.872
any angle.
