SHIGERU MIYAGAWA: Particularly
at MIT, but in other places

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:13.600
teamwork is critical
to academic success.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.210
One of the things
I tell freshmen,

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:20.290
is that I have been teaching
at MIT now for a long time.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:25.060
And the students are
wonderful and very bright,

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.850
but what I've noticed
is that every year I

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:34.180
see two or three students really
stand out after they graduate,

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.570
and go on and do big things.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.970
And I see this year
in and year out.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.270
And all of the
students are wonderful.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.320
They're academically gifted,
and they're highly motivated.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.940
They have fire in their belly.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.140
So what's the difference between
those two versus the rest?

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.110
Well, one day I figured it out.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.130
The two who go on
to do big things

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.250
have learned to
work with others.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.860
That's it.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.460
There's nothing else
that I could see.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.349
They have learned
to work not only

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:09.850
with people they share
interests, but also with people

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.190
that they don't necessarily
share interests.

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:13.350
That's the trick.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.440
It's easy to work with
people who are like you.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.990
It's harder to work with
people who are not like you.

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.350
But when you learn
to be able to work

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.420
across the spectrum
of people, then you

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.830
can basically tap their gifts.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.210
That's what entrepreneurship
is actually.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.530
And so this is a little
spiel that I give them

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.790
as part of why I
have in my syllabus,

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:45.940
a goal for this course is
to learn to work in teams.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.140
I think I have that in
every class I teach,

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.900
doesn't matter what class.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.996
A goal of this class is for
you to learn to work in teams.
