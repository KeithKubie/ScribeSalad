00:00:01.101 --> 00:00:02.636
Chuck. Come here.

00:00:02.636 --> 00:00:05.472
Get in here close,
close, close, close, close.

00:00:05.472 --> 00:00:07.140
Too close.
Back up a little bit.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.475
Good. Good.

00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:10.143
Are the liberals gone?

00:00:10.143 --> 00:00:11.979
(laughter)

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:13.347
Quick test.

00:00:13.347 --> 00:00:15.282
When they go low...

00:00:15.282 --> 00:00:17.551
-Perfect. We're alone.
-(laughter)

00:00:17.551 --> 00:00:19.586
It's time for Just Between Us.

00:00:19.586 --> 00:00:21.521
-♪ ♪
-(cheering, applause)

00:00:23.657 --> 00:00:27.961
Just between us, gun rights
are stronger than ever.

00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:30.530
In fact, that same panel
that's advocating

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.000
stronger background checks
is also about to pass

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.069
a breakthrough pro-gun measure
this week. Look at this.

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:38.338
In a major victory
for gun rights advocates,

00:00:38.338 --> 00:00:40.507
a House committee advanced
the Republican

00:00:40.507 --> 00:00:42.209
 Concealed Carry
 Reciprocity Act.

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:45.212
 Backed by the NRA, it would
 allow gun owners to carry

00:00:45.212 --> 00:00:47.748
 their concealed weapons across
 state lines with a permit.

00:00:47.748 --> 00:00:50.684
Our rights should not end
where a state line ends.

00:00:50.684 --> 00:00:52.486
This is about the equal access

00:00:52.486 --> 00:00:54.788
of your pro-choice right
of self-defense.

00:00:54.788 --> 00:00:57.024
(quietly):
Yeah, suck it, snowflakes.

00:00:57.024 --> 00:00:58.225
(laughter)

00:00:58.225 --> 00:01:01.695
Pro-choice is our thing now.

00:01:01.695 --> 00:01:04.031
Next we're coming
for their electric cars.

00:01:04.031 --> 00:01:07.801
We're gonna make them run
on elephant blood.

00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:09.303
Let's break this down.

00:01:09.303 --> 00:01:11.405
What is gun reciprocity?

00:01:11.405 --> 00:01:12.773
First off, don't worry.

00:01:12.773 --> 00:01:15.275
I know "reciprocity" sounds
like some YA novel

00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:17.611
about high schoolers
with awesome powers...

00:01:17.611 --> 00:01:21.014
And that's because it is--
I wrote it.

00:01:21.014 --> 00:01:24.851
But... the reciprocity
I'm talking about is way cooler.

00:01:24.851 --> 00:01:27.888
Gun reciprocity means that
if you're allowed to carry a gun

00:01:27.888 --> 00:01:31.124
in your state, you're allowed
to do it in any other state.

00:01:31.124 --> 00:01:33.360
And 12 states
don't have any restrictions

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.462
beyond the minimum
federal requirements.

00:01:35.462 --> 00:01:37.664
Live in those states,
it's awesome.

00:01:37.664 --> 00:01:40.267
Any day could turn
into a Die Hard movie.

00:01:40.267 --> 00:01:41.401
(laughter)

00:01:41.401 --> 00:01:44.338
Wyoming is, like,
85% Bruce Willisese.

00:01:44.338 --> 00:01:46.506
(laughter)

00:01:46.506 --> 00:01:48.208
This new bill is beautiful,

00:01:48.208 --> 00:01:50.510
because it lowers the bar
across the country,

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.612
so that every state has to abide

00:01:52.612 --> 00:01:54.581
by the loosest
concealed-carry laws.

00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:56.416
Americans love lowering the bar.

00:01:56.416 --> 00:01:58.919
It's so much easier
to get over it that way.

00:01:58.919 --> 00:02:01.555
Now, to get specific,
let's look at the laws

00:02:01.555 --> 00:02:03.156
of a state like Georgia.

00:02:03.156 --> 00:02:06.126
Say you're a convicted
domestic abuser who lives there.

00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:07.728
You have
a conceal-and-carry permit,

00:02:07.728 --> 00:02:11.365
because Georgia allows you to,
despite your abuse conviction.

00:02:11.365 --> 00:02:14.001
Then you come to a liberal
hellhole like New York

00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:17.504
that doesn't allow
domestic abusers to carry guns.

00:02:17.504 --> 00:02:20.140
I know. Crazy.
Under the reciprocity bill,

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.442
you'd still be allowed
to carry that gun.

00:02:22.442 --> 00:02:24.444
All right,
I know what you're thinking:

00:02:24.444 --> 00:02:27.314
Jordan, a domestic abuser
is not a good guy with a gun.

00:02:27.314 --> 00:02:29.416
Yes. Well, of course.
In Georgia he's not.

00:02:29.416 --> 00:02:31.818
But in New York,
maybe he would be.

00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:33.320
(laughter)

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.988
It's like Sinatra said,

00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:36.790
"If you can make it here...
with a gun,

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.359
you can make it anywhere...
with a gun."

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:41.228
Reciprocity is like

00:02:41.228 --> 00:02:43.430
if all the gunslingers
in HBO's Westworld

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.700
started showing up in other
shows with their guns.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.237
America just put more "bang"
in The Big Bang Theory.

00:02:50.237 --> 00:02:53.040
And just between us,
it gets even better,

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.343
because America is still
gunny as (bleep).

00:02:56.343 --> 00:02:58.278
And it's not just the adults.

00:02:58.278 --> 00:03:01.048
TV REPORTER: Wisconsin's new law
 that allows hunters

00:03:01.048 --> 00:03:03.316
 of any age to carry a weapon

00:03:03.316 --> 00:03:06.186
 has already led to licenses
 being sold to infants.

00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:08.522
 Ten mentored hunting licenses

00:03:08.522 --> 00:03:10.090
 were sold over
 the last two weeks,

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.126
 all to children
 under the age of one.

00:03:13.126 --> 00:03:15.062
(audience exclaims)

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.535
The terrible twos just got real.

00:03:21.535 --> 00:03:23.537
(cheers and applause)

00:03:23.537 --> 00:03:26.706
It's... it is great that this
passed in Wisconsin,

00:03:26.706 --> 00:03:28.542
but you know
what's even greater?

00:03:28.542 --> 00:03:32.045
Wisconsin became the 35th state
with no minimum hunting age.

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:34.347
They may not be able to stand
their ground yet,

00:03:34.347 --> 00:03:38.051
but they can definitely do
"tummy time" on their ground.

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:40.587
Gun advocates are gun-racking up
wins all over,

00:03:40.587 --> 00:03:42.289
no matter what the libs
are celebrating.

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:44.057
I mean,
just look at our president:

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:47.427
you really think this guy will
allow meaningful gun control?

00:03:47.427 --> 00:03:49.729
I have a license to carry
in New York.

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:52.199
Can you believe that?
Nobody knows that.

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:54.768
(mimics gunshot)

00:03:54.768 --> 00:03:57.904
(mimics gunshots)
Yeah. Oh.

00:03:57.904 --> 00:03:59.840
(mimics gunshot)

00:04:01.041 --> 00:04:04.578
You can tell Trump's a pro.

00:04:04.578 --> 00:04:08.849
Rule number one: whenever you
shoot, look dope as hell.

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:12.385
Now, remember, this whole thing
is just between us.

00:04:12.385 --> 00:04:14.521
Don't let any of those
pomegranate-juicing liberals

00:04:14.521 --> 00:04:16.189
hear about reciprocity.

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:19.126
And especially, don't let them
call this one number,

00:04:19.126 --> 00:04:21.161
which will connect them
to their representative,

00:04:21.161 --> 00:04:24.564
so they can weigh-in on the
National Carry Reciprocity Act.

00:04:24.564 --> 00:04:26.633
-Shh, shh. Shh.
-(cheers and applause)

00:04:26.633 --> 00:04:28.735
It's happening this week.
Shh, shh.

00:04:28.735 --> 00:04:31.371
Oh, yeah, and definitely do not
take a picture of this,

00:04:31.371 --> 00:04:34.975
and definitely do not post it
on social media.

00:04:34.975 --> 00:04:36.476
Yeah. If they get their hands,
on this,

00:04:36.476 --> 00:04:39.246
these liberals are going to grab
onto these dangerous opinions,

00:04:39.246 --> 00:04:40.814
conceal and carry them,

00:04:40.814 --> 00:04:42.816
and then whip them out
when we least expect it.
