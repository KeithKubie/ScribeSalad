00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.970
We divide x to the
third plus 5x minus 4

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:07.600
by x minus x--
actually, I think this

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.540
is supposed to be an x squared.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:10.290
Let me correct it.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.690
So we're going to divide x
to the third plus 5x minus 4

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.390
by x squared minus x plus 1.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.810
And just to see the different
ways we can rewrite this.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.700
We could rewrite this
as x to the third plus

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:31.090
5x minus 4 divided by x
squared minus x plus 1.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.130
Or maybe the best
way to write it

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:34.650
in this circumstance,
since we're

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.590
going to do algebraic
long division,

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:42.140
is to write it as x
squared minus x plus 1,

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.099
divided into x to
the third plus--

00:00:47.099 --> 00:00:49.390
and actually, I'm going to
leave some blank space here.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.462
We don't have an x
squared term here.

00:00:52.462 --> 00:00:54.170
But I'm going to leave
some space for it,

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.503
just so that we can align
everything in the proper place

00:00:56.503 --> 00:00:57.950
when we actually
do the division.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.470
So x to the third
plus nothing to the x

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.140
squared power plus 5x minus 4.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.350
So we have a place for the
third power, the second power,

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.360
the first power,
and the 0-th power.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.650
So now let's just do a little
bit of algebraic long division.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.720
Let's look at the
highest-degree term.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.910
x squared goes into x to
the third how many times?

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.770
Well, it goes into it x times.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.300
x to the third
divided by x squared

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.850
is equal to x to the 3 minus 2,
which is equal to x to the 1,

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.200
which is equal to x.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.550
So it goes x times.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.660
I'll write the x
right over here.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.320
And we multiply x times
this entire thing.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.560
x times x squared
is x to the third.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.820
x times negative x is
negative x squared.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.390
x times 1 is positive x.

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.660
And now we want to subtract
this whole expression

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:51.880
from that whole expression.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.580
And that's the same thing
as adding the opposite,

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.804
or multiplying each of
these terms by negative 1,

00:01:57.804 --> 00:01:59.220
and then adding
it to these terms.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.720
So let's do that.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.680
So we have negative
x to the third.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.400
Negative 1 times negative x
squared is positive x squared.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.560
And then positive x times
negative 1 is negative x.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.230
And so let's now add everything.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.600
x to the third minus x to
third-- those cancel out.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.700
0 plus x squared
gives us an x squared.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.070
5x minus x gives us a plus 4x.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.397
And then we bring
down this minus 4.

00:02:25.397 --> 00:02:26.980
We're not adding
anything to it there.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.530
You could view there's a 0 here.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.290
So let's bring down the minus 4.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.300
And now let's look at
the highest-degree terms.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:38.330
x squared goes into x
squared exactly one time.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.010
It's the same thing,
so we put a plus 1.

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.800
And then you have 1 times
x squared is x squared.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.615
1 times negative
x is negative x.

00:02:47.615 --> 00:02:51.770
1 times 1 is 1.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.330
And now we want to
subtract this from that,

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.080
or we want to add the opposite.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.330
And to add the
opposite, we can just

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.640
multiply each of these
terms by negative 1.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.070
x squared becomes
negative x squared.

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.770
Negative x times
negative 1 is positive x.

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.840
And then positive 1 times
negative 1 is negative 1.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.620
Now let's do the
addition. x squared

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.510
minus x squared--
they cancel out.

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.420
4x plus x is 5x.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:24.490
And then we have negative
4 minus 1 is negative 5.

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.230
Now, you might be
tempted to keep dividing,

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.230
but you can't any more.

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.670
This term right here, the
highest-degree term here,

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.030
is now higher than the
highest-degree term

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.530
that you're going to
try to divide into.

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:37.950
So we have a remainder.

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.000
So the answer to this is--
this expression right over here

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:55.520
is equal to x plus 1
plus the remainder,

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:00.770
plus 5x minus 5-- whatever
the remainder is-- divided

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:07.100
by x squared minus x plus 1.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.130
If this was divisible,
we could keep dividing,

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:10.213
but we're saying it's not.

00:04:10.213 --> 00:04:12.370
It's now a lower degree
than this down here.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.550
So we could say it's
x plus 1 plus whatever

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:19.663
this remainder is, divided
by this thing over here.

00:04:19.663 --> 00:04:21.829
So our answer-- I'm going
to write it one more time.

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:30.480
It's x plus 1 plus 5x minus 5,
over x squared minus x plus 1.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.920
And we can check
that this works.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.000
If we take this thing over
here, and we multiply it

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.600
by this thing over
here, we should

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.390
get the x to the
third plus 5x minus 4.

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:41.610
So let's do that.

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:50.170
Let's multiply this thing
by x squared minus x plus 1.

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:51.910
And to do that,
let's just distribute

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.935
this whole trinomial
times each of these terms.

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.300
When we do the
first term, we have

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.030
x squared minus
x plus 1 times x.

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:06.840
So that's going to
be x times x squared,

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.500
which is x to the third;
x times negative x, which

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.700
is negative x squared; x
times 1, which is plus x.

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.420
Then we can multiply
this whole thing times 1.

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:20.360
So it's going to be plus
x squared minus x plus 1.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.590
I'm just multiplying
all of these times 1.

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.580
And then we can multiply this
whole thing times this thing.

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.860
Now, this is the same
as the denominator here.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:29.890
So it'll cancel out.

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:31.100
This will cancel with that.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:36.440
And we're just going to be left
with the numerator over here,

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.170
so plus 5x minus 5.

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:42.330
And now we can try
to simplify it.

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.600
We only have one third-degree
term, the x to the third.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.360
So we have x to the third here.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.809
Second-degree terms-- we
have a negative x squared.

00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:52.600
And then we also have
a positive x squared.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.850
So they cancel out
with each other.

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:56.450
First-degree terms-- let's see.

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:59.230
We have a positive
x and a negative x.

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:01.290
Those cancel out
with each other.

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:03.600
So we're just going to
have that 5x over here.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.440
So we're just going
to have this 5x.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.160
So then we have plus 5x.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.690
And then we have the 0-th degree
terms, or the constant terms.

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.150
We have a positive
1 and a negative 5.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.900
Add them together.

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.570
You get negative 4.

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:19.520
So you get x to the
third plus 5x minus 4,

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.970
which is exactly what
we had over here.
