00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.990
[inaudible].

2
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.700
<v 1>So with that being said about the technological component,</v>

3
00:00:06.701 --> 00:00:09.190
watching cable news shift right now,

4
00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.270
there's also an issue that a lot of people are getting their news from this,

5
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.300
from this show shows like this Shapiro wrote in all of these guys that's kind of

6
00:00:19.091 --> 00:00:20.860
worrying to at some level,
right?

7
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.610
And I say that I'm talking about guys that I love,
but like,
just that,
you know,

8
00:00:24.611 --> 00:00:28.000
the fact checking is different here than say it would be on cable news.

9
00:00:28.001 --> 00:00:30.190
Not that cable news has done a great job.

10
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.690
<v 0>No,
but you're right.
I mean,
we're part,
you know,
we're,
we're always,
uh,</v>

11
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.510
a point on a continuum and we're,

12
00:00:36.511 --> 00:00:41.430
we're in the middle of a cycle where the media are being reinvented completely.

13
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.320
And you're right.
I mean,
the problem with individual operators,

14
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.820
solo guys on Youtube is they have so much less to lose than a television network

15
00:00:50.821 --> 00:00:54.240
does.
That the incentives to get the facts right or be responsible of course,

16
00:00:54.241 --> 00:00:58.740
much lower.
Um,
the problem is,
as you well know better than anybody,

17
00:00:58.741 --> 00:01:02.670
is that the media has so discredited themselves that it's like,

18
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.250
it's so obviously propaganda.
But did you ever think it could be that bad?

19
00:01:08.251 --> 00:01:09.120
No,
I never did.

20
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.920
<v 1>Every day I look at a story from CNN or political and forget buzzfeed and all</v>

21
00:01:15.591 --> 00:01:18.440
those other like forget the really bad ones vox.

22
00:01:18.441 --> 00:01:20.750
And it's like everything you guys are doing,

23
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.920
every headline and the way every Republican has a picture that they look awful

24
00:01:24.921 --> 00:01:28.400
in the picture.
Democrats look great and like every little thing,

25
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:29.610
it's like they're just

26
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.200
<v 0>smashing us with it.
They just turn it up to 11 and I've,
I mean,</v>

27
00:01:34.201 --> 00:01:38.280
I grew up in a media family and when my dad was anchor here in la of ABC,

28
00:01:38.281 --> 00:01:39.120
and so I,
I,

29
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.910
I've always lived in this world and I always thought the media are liberal,

30
00:01:41.911 --> 00:01:44.760
but I was totally wrong about that.
They're not ideologues actually,

31
00:01:44.761 --> 00:01:49.140
their party people.
That's what I totally missed.
They are loyal to the party.

32
00:01:49.141 --> 00:01:52.800
They feel powerless except as part of a group that is the main distinction

33
00:01:52.801 --> 00:01:54.930
between left and right in this country.

34
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.340
And so whatever the Democratic Party's imperatives are,
they will act on them.

35
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.500
If the Democratic Party invaded Canada tomorrow,
they wouldn't see I'm serious.

36
00:02:04.501 --> 00:02:07.830
They'd be like,
you know these Canadians,
they live among us there.

37
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.650
You know what I mean?
They're a fifth column like they would actually do.

38
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.690
It doesn't matter what the product does,
they will defend it.

39
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.250
Once you understand that,
that it all makes sense.
They feel threatened.

40
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.610
That's the truth and you and people like you are the main threat to them.

41
00:02:20.611 --> 00:02:23.670
It's not me actually I'm on a competing medium,

42
00:02:23.671 --> 00:02:27.420
but in the same medium they are.

43
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.740
They know that their power is ebbing and when you feel like you're losing

44
00:02:31.741 --> 00:02:33.390
control,
that's when he tried to assert control.

45
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.320
That's when the most ludicrous propaganda comes when you feel like,
you know,

46
00:02:37.321 --> 00:02:40.590
oh my gosh,
they're not listening to me right after the yell.
The

47
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.020
<v 1>funny part is I owe and I tweaked this all the time.</v>

48
00:02:43.021 --> 00:02:46.660
It's like if these guys had just been like pretty bad.
Yeah,

49
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.390
I think it would have been tolerable.

50
00:02:48.391 --> 00:02:51.090
People would have because it had been happening for so long.

51
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.970
People kind of wooded and have noticed that maybe they could have got a little

52
00:02:53.971 --> 00:02:55.620
worse than we would have been okay with it.

53
00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.190
But it's like they've just completely bottomed and

54
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.610
<v 0>well,
this is one of the criticisms of Trump that has a lot of truth in it.</v>

55
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.310
When people were like,
well,
he's a destroyer.
He destroys everything he touches,

56
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.440
you know,
probably an overstatement.
But he does,
you know,
you get close,

57
00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:15.250
you sit and stare at Trump all day and you're going to burn out.

58
00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.790
You're okay.
You are.
And this,
one of the things I try not to do,

59
00:03:18.791 --> 00:03:21.070
I don't do a show about Trump.
I didn't write a book about Trump.

60
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.760
I'm not against Trump.
I think Trump is useful in a truth teller in some ways,

61
00:03:24.761 --> 00:03:28.390
but,
but the people who obsess about Trump are destroyed.

62
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.780
And that would include his opponents,
maybe especially his opponents.

63
00:03:31.781 --> 00:03:34.690
So what would you do to get some of those people back if they're,

64
00:03:34.691 --> 00:03:35.590
if they're out there now,

65
00:03:35.591 --> 00:03:38.680
the ones that really are overboard on Trump that I haven't,
you know,

66
00:03:38.681 --> 00:03:42.040
I've been able to reach them,
some liberals and good lefties and liberalism.

67
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.020
So that,
okay,
we can put a hand out for them.

68
00:03:44.021 --> 00:03:48.580
But for the people that are really feeling like they're buying all the nonsense,

69
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.890
right guys,
Hitler and all of this really,

70
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.350
do you have any technique that gives them sure.

71
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.520
I mean I almost never argue about Trump.
I really try not to.

72
00:03:57.521 --> 00:04:01.600
I mean the platonic ideal for me of a show is never mentioning Trump because I

73
00:04:01.601 --> 00:04:04.330
try to take the long view.
I mean look,
other shows had different roles.
You know,

74
00:04:04.331 --> 00:04:07.150
everybody sees like,
you know,
his or her specific task.

75
00:04:07.151 --> 00:04:10.120
But I feel like mine is to try to take the long view,

76
00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:12.190
not easy in the middle of this new cycle.

77
00:04:12.191 --> 00:04:14.950
Of course I get caught up all the time and that,
you know,

78
00:04:14.951 --> 00:04:19.480
the bullshit of the day but,
but mo,
but I really try to think about like,

79
00:04:19.481 --> 00:04:23.290
well how would this look 10 years from now?
Like Trump will be gone.
I'll be gone,

80
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.380
we'll all be gone.
Cause we actually tie at the end.
It turns out so.

81
00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.030
But I want the country 10 years.
But I didn't say like,

82
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.390
what kind of country do you want?
That's the question.

83
00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:38.440
Do you want to live in a place where the individual has the right to dissent?

84
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.480
And I think most people would say yes,
I do.
Yeah.

85
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.330
Is that why the free speech stuff has become so important to you?

86
00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.870
Cause I think cause you get that more than foundational.
I mean that's just,

87
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.180
if they can tell you what to say,

88
00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.810
they can control what you think and if they can control what you think.

89
00:04:52.811 --> 00:04:55.150
You're not fully human.
And so you're really,

90
00:04:55.151 --> 00:04:58.930
you're not fighting for a political party or an ideology or fighting for your

91
00:04:58.931 --> 00:04:59.650
humanity.

92
00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.430
I believe that that's what I was taught as a child by liberals and they were

93
00:05:03.431 --> 00:05:06.150
right and I bought it then by the way.
And so the ACL,

94
00:05:06.151 --> 00:05:10.900
you stood up for Clearance Brandenburg who is not only at literally a clansman

95
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.340
from Ohio,
but a moron like literally a moron.

96
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.470
He was the least appealing person ever.

97
00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.860
And they stick their entire credibility on defending this guy.

98
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.470
Why'd they do that?
They did it,
of course,

99
00:05:23.471 --> 00:05:26.290
to preserve the absolute right of free speech for the rest of us.

100
00:05:26.291 --> 00:05:30.190
And they made the country better.
When you abandon that dude,
it's over.

101
00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.520
And now you see what comes out of the ACO and you're like,
you're not,

102
00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:38.290
you're not defending free speech.
You're clearly a progressive group.

103
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.760
They're opposing frequency.
They issued a statement saying no,

104
00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.630
some speeches is too offensive.
Really.

105
00:05:43.631 --> 00:05:47.830
Cause you defended the right of Nazis to march through Skokie,

106
00:05:47.831 --> 00:05:52.240
which everyone forgets had the highest percentage of Holocaust survivors of any

107
00:05:52.241 --> 00:05:54.010
town like outside Israel.
Yeah.

108
00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.380
I mean it was the most offensive thing you could do.

109
00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.910
And they defended it and they lost a lot of money doing it.

110
00:05:58.911 --> 00:06:02.210
Like they lost a ton of donations doing it,
but they defended the principal.

111
00:06:02.211 --> 00:06:05.190
And I noticed you've gotten 80 instructions book,
should we talk about there?

112
00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:10.160
Here.
So there are people like her are Dershowitz are these former ACL you board

113
00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:12.500
members who were like totally bewildered by this.

114
00:06:12.501 --> 00:06:15.380
Not because we care about the ACU is institution,
who cares?

115
00:06:15.381 --> 00:06:19.970
It's some dumb nonprofit.
But because the principles are literally foundational.

116
00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.160
<v 1>Yeah.
All right.
So let's,
let's jump back for just a second here.</v>

117
00:06:23.161 --> 00:06:26.850
So I want to talk about Fox generally.
Yeah.
So first off,

118
00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:31.170
you guys are doing something right.
And I don't mean just you hear clearly,

119
00:06:31.171 --> 00:06:32.070
if you look at the ratings,

120
00:06:32.071 --> 00:06:36.120
I just looked at this thing and it's like the last bottom 20 shows are all CNN.

121
00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.160
Yeah,
the top 10 are basically all fox.

122
00:06:38.161 --> 00:06:41.760
Maybe there's one MSNBC show in there beyond just you.
What do you,

123
00:06:41.761 --> 00:06:43.680
what do you think that Fox is just doing all right?

124
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:48.990
<v 0>You know,
being slightly different.
I mean,
I,
you know,
I would argue that the fee,</v>

125
00:06:48.991 --> 00:06:51.730
I mean I can only speak for my shot,
I'm only in charge of an hour of the,

126
00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:56.820
of 24 but you know that it's actually worth defending the principles as distinct

127
00:06:58.151 --> 00:07:01.840
from the individuals or the political figures in over time.

128
00:07:01.841 --> 00:07:03.880
Like you're not embarrassed to do that.
It's worth doing.

129
00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:08.530
But I think as a business matter and just sort of a matter of life,

130
00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:13.030
if you're the guy who's not entirely with the herd and you're like,
actually no,

131
00:07:13.031 --> 00:07:15.010
I,
it's a little bit different.
You know,

132
00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.760
you go to the 19 other stores and you can buy this one product and I've got a

133
00:07:18.761 --> 00:07:21.280
different product.
I mean,
I don't think,
why is that bad?
Yeah,

134
00:07:21.281 --> 00:07:25.060
so that just seems obvious that [inaudible] is how offensive that is.

135
00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.510
It's like fog and I've worked,
I've worked at CNN,
I've worked at MSNBC,

136
00:07:28.511 --> 00:07:30.350
I worked at PBS,
I worked at Esquire,
I'm,

137
00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:34.240
and I've worked at like a million different liberal publications and television

138
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:37.270
channels and they're all selling exactly the same product.

139
00:07:37.271 --> 00:07:41.710
And then there's Fox in the mainstream landscape that's different.

140
00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.950
Just one channel is different.
And the,

141
00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:47.860
the feeling overwhelming feeling is that should not be allowed.

142
00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:50.920
Like I can't believe that they're allowed to say what they're saying.

143
00:07:50.921 --> 00:07:53.440
We need to shut them down.
Well that's the irony.

144
00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:56.190
<v 1>It's like you guys are the only ones that will put me on.</v>

145
00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:00.720
I will gladly go on CNN or MSN.
You get on those channels.
I've never been asked.

146
00:08:00.721 --> 00:08:04.470
I can't just show up there and bang on the door.
But you guys call me and nobody,

147
00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:07.500
every time I've done your show,
it's alive.
I never know what you're going to ask.

148
00:08:07.501 --> 00:08:11.010
Worse.
And,
and same thing with some of the other shows and it's like,

149
00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.270
I will go where I can talk to people.
Exactly.
I don't,

150
00:08:14.271 --> 00:08:16.350
I don't want to be edited and misrepresented,
which,

151
00:08:16.351 --> 00:08:19.710
so I don't know that I would trust a lot of these other,
you know,
um,
okay.

152
00:08:19.711 --> 00:08:20.420
So that's sort of,

153
00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:22.280
<v 0>but it's just so uninteresting.
I mean,</v>

154
00:08:22.281 --> 00:08:26.870
if everybody's saying repeating the exact same pieties diversity is our

155
00:08:26.871 --> 00:08:28.280
strength,
our children,

156
00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:31.490
our future or whatever this sort of banality is that you think is profound.

157
00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:34.430
If everybody is saying the exact same thing,
like that's just boring.

158
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.320
I like to have,
I like to have people on who surprise me like what you do.

159
00:08:39.321 --> 00:08:43.580
You know what I mean?
Like that.
Just because again,
I'm more curious.
I mean,

160
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.140
I'm a human being.
I want to think about it.

161
00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:48.280
<v 1>Does it ever drive you crazy to just be in the,</v>

162
00:08:48.281 --> 00:08:51.070
in the constraints of what television is?
Yeah.
You know,
like,

163
00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:52.990
cause we've done segments where it's like,
you know,

164
00:08:52.991 --> 00:08:56.100
we've got maybe six minutes and I feel like I just,
and then you're like,

165
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.960
<v 0>Reuben,
I'll see you next time.
You know?
Yeah.
I mean,</v>

166
00:08:57.961 --> 00:09:01.920
I was a writer before I went into TV and one of the reasons that I failed a

167
00:09:01.921 --> 00:09:05.550
couple of times pretty spectacularly in TV is because I didn't understand the

168
00:09:05.551 --> 00:09:09.780
medium and I didn't respect it.
I was like,
I'm a writer,
I'm a deep person.

169
00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:13.620
Here I am in the shallow medium.
And what I didn't understand is it TV is,

170
00:09:13.621 --> 00:09:14.250
it's complete,

171
00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:19.230
it's a completely different thing and it's got its own requirements and its own

172
00:09:19.231 --> 00:09:24.060
rules and you need to understand what it's capable of and is capable of great

173
00:09:24.061 --> 00:09:26.460
things.
It's just not capable of everything.
You know what I mean?

174
00:09:26.461 --> 00:09:29.100
It's not capable of explaining concepts,
complex concepts,

175
00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:30.360
just that's not what TV is about.

176
00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:32.760
Someone was for is said odd to you that the interview,

177
00:09:32.761 --> 00:09:36.630
the real long form this like just sit down with another human being that you

178
00:09:36.631 --> 00:09:40.080
know,
CNN booted Larry King,
which I think was the beginning of the end for them.

179
00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:42.150
So smart.
I think that I really believe it.

180
00:09:42.151 --> 00:09:43.770
I mean I've never heard anybody else say that,

181
00:09:43.771 --> 00:09:47.280
but I argued that when I worked there.
Yeah.
So you,
so you were,

182
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:48.390
because they were getting rid of him.

183
00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:50.730
I think he told me he was here a couple of weeks ago.
He said,

184
00:09:50.731 --> 00:09:52.650
I thought it was the number one rated show is still on the network.

185
00:09:52.651 --> 00:09:56.670
It was number two at the time.
And they said no,
no,
we're done 30 years audios.

186
00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:58.590
Right.
And they also ended crossfire,

187
00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:02.340
which had become a kind of perversion of its former self but I was in both

188
00:10:02.341 --> 00:10:06.030
versions of it and at one point cross fire was like a public service,
you know,

189
00:10:06.031 --> 00:10:08.940
to sort of equally matched something shift with crossfire.

190
00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:12.870
Cause I do remember watching you on crossfire watching those guys and it was so

191
00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:15.340
it became partisan,
which is uninteresting.
Yeah.

192
00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.670
Nobody wants to hear what your team thinks.
We already know.

193
00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:22.700
What's interesting is when we throw up an idea or a policy and we deconstructed

194
00:10:22.891 --> 00:10:26.460
and we have two fairly evenly matched people,
you know,

195
00:10:26.461 --> 00:10:30.300
kind of competing for you,
you know,
like w.

196
00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:34.440
So anyway it became something much more.
But the idea was always a good idea.

197
00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:36.330
And especially the idea of Larry King,

198
00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:39.420
I pitched that show too many different channels,

199
00:10:39.421 --> 00:10:43.140
black curtain to people,
hour long conversation.

200
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:47.580
And my argument was this will rate,
people want this,
there's none of it.

201
00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:49.130
And everyone's like good things.

202
00:10:49.131 --> 00:10:52.770
So we need to interstitials and graphics and it's like they love interstitials.

203
00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:53.880
It's unbelievable.

204
00:10:53.881 --> 00:10:58.881
And now of course with youtube it's like you look at the numbers that you're

205
00:10:59.221 --> 00:11:03.270
getting and others are getting with that exact format and they're huge.

206
00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:07.440
So it turns out,
yeah,
of course there's a market for that.
Why wouldn't there be,

207
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.580
how much of all of this,

208
00:11:08.581 --> 00:11:11.090
everything we're discussing here and so much of what you're doing on your show

209
00:11:11.091 --> 00:11:15.720
is just that people are just tired of having their intellect insulted.

210
00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:19.860
Totally,
completely.
We'll look at television versus movies.

211
00:11:19.861 --> 00:11:23.190
If you had told me 30 years ago that the most interesting,
you know,

212
00:11:23.191 --> 00:11:27.780
visual art being created would be in television,
scripted television.
Like what?

213
00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:31.940
I don't think so.
That's the province of morons.
It's like,
you know what I mean?

214
00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:35.370
Right.
Full House.
But,
um,

215
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:39.330
but it turned out to be true because to stand up for Bob Saget,
right.

216
00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:42.840
I actually know Bob Saget,
Bob Saget and he's actually very smart.

217
00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:46.110
But the point is that there is,

218
00:11:46.111 --> 00:11:51.060
especially when we're all narrow casting,
when you don't need to reach,
you know,

219
00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:56.150
80 million people when you can 3 million and that is a more than viable

220
00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:57.820
commercial proposition.

221
00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:02.230
You can aim at an audience that wants that and there is a substantial audience

222
00:12:02.231 --> 00:12:04.780
that does.
Yeah.
Okay.
So Fox News,
we get it.

223
00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:08.500
Some things are clearly going right and by ratings and everything else.

224
00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:11.050
Is there anything that Fox is doing that you think is wrong?

225
00:12:11.051 --> 00:12:15.930
Is he too close to the president or,
or anything?
You know,
I,
I mean,
I mean I'm,

226
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.550
obviously I'm dodging the question.
Even if I had a real answer,

227
00:12:18.551 --> 00:12:21.330
I would run from that question because I worked there.
I have to ask him.

228
00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:25.510
But if I'm being completely honest,
no,
I'm not a huge,

229
00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:30.520
I'm so caught up in our hour and I'm so,

230
00:12:30.521 --> 00:12:34.630
it's such a hive in my show and we have like,
you know,

231
00:12:34.631 --> 00:12:39.490
I intentionally hired really smart,
smarter than I am people.
Um,

232
00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:42.340
that I don't have a sense sometimes of the larger programming.

233
00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.140
I would say as a general matter,

234
00:12:44.141 --> 00:12:48.760
I've always tried not to be aligned with any politician because in the end,

235
00:12:48.761 --> 00:12:50.620
no matter how sympathetic it might be to the message,

236
00:12:50.621 --> 00:12:55.570
it's a politician and I'm not,
if I want it to be a policy maker,
I would be one.

237
00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:58.420
Cause it's pretty low bar for that.
It turns,
it turns out,

238
00:12:58.421 --> 00:13:02.140
I mean [inaudible] right,
exactly.
So do you ever think about it?

239
00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:05.710
Not for two seconds.
I would never want,

240
00:13:05.711 --> 00:13:08.590
I mean I live in that world so I know what it is.
I don't want that.

241
00:13:08.591 --> 00:13:11.800
I have a journalist temperament.
I like to watch.

242
00:13:11.801 --> 00:13:14.920
I like the freedom to say what I really think is true.
I don't want,

243
00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:16.300
one thing I will say about Fox,

244
00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:21.160
which I'm grateful for every single day and this is Rupert Murdoch.
They don't,

245
00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:24.700
they do not control what you say.
I've had this show for two years,

246
00:13:24.701 --> 00:13:28.240
almost exactly two years now.
A single time as someone called it.

247
00:13:28.241 --> 00:13:30.880
Well no one calls me at all,
but like no one calls.
It is like,

248
00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:35.320
I can't believe you said there's nothing like that.
Pure editorial freedom.

249
00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:38.770
So like why is that not a great job?
Yeah,
no,
I mean,
and I know it again,

250
00:13:38.771 --> 00:13:41.950
I just want to illustrate because people don't understand that every time I have

251
00:13:41.951 --> 00:13:44.170
gone on your show that we,
you know,

252
00:13:44.171 --> 00:13:47.320
they give you some sense of what we're going to talk about and that's it.

253
00:13:47.321 --> 00:13:49.960
We go live it's life.
And if you want to say something insane,

254
00:13:49.961 --> 00:13:52.940
like we can't stop you.
Yeah.
You know,
and,

255
00:13:52.941 --> 00:13:56.770
and I would say another thing is the way TV works,
at least at our network.

256
00:13:56.771 --> 00:13:59.440
But I think this is true.
When I worked at the others,
it was also true.

257
00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:02.740
The shows have enormous autonomy.
They really do.
I mean,

258
00:14:02.741 --> 00:14:04.270
there's not a morning call where it's like,

259
00:14:04.271 --> 00:14:07.690
here's our line on this or that or the other.
It's like I never talked to any,

260
00:14:07.691 --> 00:14:09.820
I talked to my executive producer,
Justin Wells,

261
00:14:09.821 --> 00:14:13.150
who I love and a lot of my other producers all morning and she's in the car

262
00:14:13.151 --> 00:14:15.250
parked outside.
It was just doing a show like,
here's where I think we should do.

263
00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:19.080
There's,
I mean,
we can do whatever we want.
Yeah.
What's,

264
00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:22.000
what's your day to day like?
Go over there.
So I know what it's like to do.

265
00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:25.060
I do a couple shows a week and I'm doing long form and this way,

266
00:14:25.061 --> 00:14:28.590
but we're not doing a zillion segments and all and all the interstitials and all

267
00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:31.390
that stuff.
What's your sort of day to day?
Tucker wakes up.

268
00:14:31.391 --> 00:14:34.570
He's got a show that night.
Yeah.
I mean,
I try and I'm married.

269
00:14:34.571 --> 00:14:38.110
I've been married for 27 years.
I really like my wife.
My kids are all gone,

270
00:14:38.111 --> 00:14:41.170
so I really try and stay home.
I mean,

271
00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:44.260
the key in daily TV is not to go insane.

272
00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.900
That actually is like the whole deal right there.

273
00:14:46.901 --> 00:14:51.040
If you can keep from becoming an insecure sort of bag of,

274
00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:56.570
um,
do you mean that just because of the media criticism and just constantly

275
00:14:56.571 --> 00:14:59.340
worrying about ratings and like the whole,
the whole trick of bays that,

276
00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:03.920
but just the medium itself leaves most anchors at some point feeling totally

277
00:15:03.921 --> 00:15:06.560
exposed and alone it's like I'm out here,
you know,

278
00:15:06.561 --> 00:15:10.640
I've got a staff of 80 people or whatever,
but in the end I'm out here live.

279
00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:14.960
It's just me.
I'm taking all the crap and no one's backing me up.

280
00:15:14.961 --> 00:15:18.320
I mean every person in the business feels that way at a certain point and then

281
00:15:18.321 --> 00:15:23.150
you start to feel like,
you know,
no one understands it,
you know what I mean?

282
00:15:23.151 --> 00:15:27.620
And you actually become so self pitying and self involved that no matter how

283
00:15:27.621 --> 00:15:28.580
much they pay you,

284
00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:33.740
your deeply unhappy and then you started acting erratic ways and like look at TV

285
00:15:33.741 --> 00:15:36.000
and you know exactly who's going through this.
Right?

286
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:40.130
Everybody except me because I keep,

287
00:15:40.131 --> 00:15:43.700
my world's so small,
we're not,
I'm married,
my high school girlfriend,

288
00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:46.910
I live walking distance from my dad and my brother and my college roommate.

289
00:15:46.911 --> 00:15:51.730
And best friend and that's who I talk to every day,
every day.
And uh,

290
00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:53.870
and the reason I do that is because I love them,

291
00:15:53.871 --> 00:15:58.871
but also because I don't want to feel the way that most people on TV do.

292
00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:03.130
I want,
I want to talk to people I love and trust and,

293
00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:07.190
and I want my security and happiness to come from those relationships and not

294
00:16:07.191 --> 00:16:10.880
from the affirmation I get on television because you will become a crazy person.

295
00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:13.250
Someone once said to me ahead of a TV network,
one said,

296
00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:17.030
what do you think my job is?
I said,
I don't know,
running a TV network.

297
00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:22.130
And he goes,
no,
it's keeping millionaires from killing themselves.
My job.
Yet,

298
00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:24.110
how dark is that?
That's also true.

299
00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:28.580
It's like his job was to keep the people from going totally bananas because the

300
00:16:28.581 --> 00:16:33.200
medium itself drives you crazy and you're doing this.
No booze,

301
00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:38.090
no cigarettes anymore.
Right?
You got any vice,
the booze is easy.

302
00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:41.930
Drinking coffee.
I drink a lot.

303
00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:46.840
Voltaire levels of coffee.
Not quite as impressive effects,
but yeah,

304
00:16:46.841 --> 00:16:51.020
I like quit smoking four or five years ago and,
but I'm,
I'm,
you know,

305
00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:54.170
I wouldn't call it advice,
but I'm,
uh,
I'm,
uh,

306
00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:58.640
enthusiastic user of nicotine gum and laws and Joe's because I think they really

307
00:16:58.641 --> 00:17:03.300
have improved my life like a lot,
I think,
I mean,
I don't want to,
you know,

308
00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.270
endorse the products,

309
00:17:05.271 --> 00:17:08.600
but I'm not sure what the downside is of using nicotine.

310
00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:10.910
There's a huge downside from smoking.
Of course,

311
00:17:10.911 --> 00:17:13.980
the target gives you cancer and emphysema,
but,
uh,

312
00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:17.090
I don't think that we've shown that nicotine for people who don't have blood

313
00:17:17.091 --> 00:17:20.360
pressure problems and I don't,
um,
hurts you.

314
00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:23.960
And I think there's a lot of evidence that that's great.
Yeah.
All right.

315
00:17:23.961 --> 00:17:26.210
So I want to spend the remaining time really focusing on the book.
We,

316
00:17:26.211 --> 00:17:30.140
we sorta did.
Yeah.
I think we did everything.
We did everything else,

317
00:17:30.141 --> 00:17:32.690
but let's really focus in on the book.
Okay.
If,

318
00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:34.910
if we're on the brink of a revolution,

319
00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:40.880
what are your prescriptions to say?
But I mean,

320
00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:45.290
I think the first thing you need to do is cool the temperature a little bit.

321
00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:50.070
President's not good at that.
That's not his by temperamentally.
He's incapable

322
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:54.030
<v 1>of doing that.
I don't think he sees it as an important thing to do.
So is that,</v>

323
00:17:54.031 --> 00:17:56.760
do you think the fundamental,
like sort of if we're looking at this just at a,

324
00:17:56.761 --> 00:17:58.460
at a base level,
that,
that,

325
00:17:58.461 --> 00:18:00.810
that Trump's temperament and the way the media is with him,

326
00:18:00.811 --> 00:18:02.760
is that sort of the root of everything else,

327
00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:05.680
<v 0>the volatilities,
the problem?
I mean,
I,</v>

328
00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:09.340
I think that we needed to awaken the people in charge,

329
00:18:09.341 --> 00:18:13.690
not simply of our political system but also of our economy and our culture from

330
00:18:13.691 --> 00:18:16.750
their stupor.
You know,
hey,
you're not listening.

331
00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:18.340
We're going to let this orange guy to wake you up.

332
00:18:18.341 --> 00:18:21.040
I actually think that was a useful thing and necessary thing.

333
00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:25.810
But repeated cycles of political volatility,

334
00:18:25.811 --> 00:18:27.010
like break your country.

335
00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:30.940
Obviously there are a million examples of this and it's obvious.
So,
um,

336
00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:33.670
you need to calm people down in the main way.

337
00:18:33.671 --> 00:18:35.890
You calm people down as the way you come children down,

338
00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:40.750
which is you explained to them as simply and clearly as you can.
Why?

339
00:18:40.751 --> 00:18:43.930
What's happening is happening while you're making these decisions and you give

340
00:18:43.931 --> 00:18:47.770
them some sense that they have some controller,
total control,

341
00:18:47.771 --> 00:18:50.320
but some control over the decisions that you're making.
You know,

342
00:18:50.321 --> 00:18:53.740
you and franchise.
Then we bring them in.
In a democracy,
you need to,
you need to,

343
00:18:53.741 --> 00:18:57.910
I mean the system is predicated on the idea.
So you need to say to people,
look,

344
00:18:57.911 --> 00:19:02.500
you know you want x,
Y,
and z.
You elected this guy to build a wall.

345
00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:04.630
We think of Wallace stupid.
We don't think it's going to work.

346
00:19:04.631 --> 00:19:06.190
We think it's kind of embarrassing actually.
It doesn't matter.

347
00:19:06.191 --> 00:19:08.620
We're going to do it because you have demanded it.

348
00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:12.400
You have to kind of give people a sense that the democracy,
Israel,

349
00:19:12.401 --> 00:19:13.390
if they think it's fake,

350
00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:15.970
they think it's really an oligarchy posing as a democracy,

351
00:19:15.971 --> 00:19:18.280
what are they going to do?
You didn't want to think about that.

352
00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:22.540
So just practice democracy a little bit would calm things down a lot.

353
00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:25.000
<v 1>Is anyone doing it better than us,</v>

354
00:19:25.001 --> 00:19:28.390
like for all the sort of anger at each other right now.

355
00:19:28.391 --> 00:19:29.350
And it's funny cause you know,

356
00:19:29.351 --> 00:19:32.260
I spend time on Twitter where it seems like the civil war has begun already.

357
00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:35.680
And then I get out there in real life and I'm on this tour and it's like I need

358
00:19:35.681 --> 00:19:39.700
thousands of peoples all across the middle of the country who are wonderful and

359
00:19:39.701 --> 00:19:42.910
open and decent and all those things.
Um,

360
00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:47.970
<v 0>but I lost my question in that.
What was the point of that?
I mean,</v>

361
00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.910
is it actually as bad as it seems in,
has anyone,

362
00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:52.660
any other country more stable and happy

363
00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:55.200
<v 1>pure than ours?
Oh,
that was it.
Yes.
It's somewhat here.</v>

364
00:19:55.201 --> 00:19:56.800
Is there an example to look at?

365
00:19:56.801 --> 00:19:59.350
Because I see all these people always complaining and as you said,

366
00:19:59.351 --> 00:20:02.620
it's easier to break things and burn them down than it is to build.

367
00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:05.680
So all these people are always,
oh,
look at these countries,
look at the know,

368
00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:07.870
always said,
look at the Nordic countries.
That seems to be the big one.

369
00:20:07.871 --> 00:20:09.410
Look at that.
Sweden and you know,

370
00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:11.260
even though Sweden's got all sorts of problems right now,

371
00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:13.930
you're one of the only people covering it.
Actually.
Um,

372
00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:16.450
I'm one of the only sweets on television.
Maybe that's why you Swedish.

373
00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:19.180
My name was Carlson.
Oh,
all right.
There you go.

374
00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:22.790
I've got a lot of Ikea and [inaudible].

375
00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:24.620
<v 0>Not In any meaningful sense.
Swedish.
I mean,</v>

376
00:20:24.621 --> 00:20:28.520
I guess I am genetically Swedish stuff that I even care about that stuff.
One,

377
00:20:28.521 --> 00:20:31.900
1000,
24
check.
Um,

378
00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:36.890
but I mean that those are not models we can replicate for obvious reasons.

379
00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:39.820
Is the country of what Sweden's got 8 million people go.

380
00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:43.580
I'm telling something like that anyway.
Uh,
no.
Who Does it look?

381
00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:48.040
Nobody does it better.
There's no greater country.
I don't a foreign passport.

382
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:48.910
I'm stuck here.

383
00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:53.500
I plan to do everything I can for the country because I have a longterm interest

384
00:20:53.501 --> 00:20:56.380
in it and I don't want to move anywhere else.
I can't think of anywhere better.

385
00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:59.590
How Pine Switzerland's pretty nice,
but there's no humor allows.

386
00:20:59.591 --> 00:21:02.710
They're probably the,
anyway,
the point is,
um,
no,
I,

387
00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:06.790
you could look at countries and see their ruling classes doing things you wish

388
00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:11.050
ours did.
There's no country I kind of despise more than China.

389
00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:16.440
But one thing I do admire about China is that its ruling clique,

390
00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:20.740
uh,
thinks long term about stability.

391
00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:22.960
That's their overriding concern.

392
00:21:22.961 --> 00:21:25.960
Now of course that's rooted in their desire to hold onto power,

393
00:21:25.961 --> 00:21:27.610
which is ignorable I get it.

394
00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:32.970
But they understand how important continuity and stability are to the site.

395
00:21:33.171 --> 00:21:35.470
So they think deeply and they don't make the right decisions all the time.

396
00:21:35.471 --> 00:21:38.920
Obviously the one child policy is a disaster,
but they,
that's how they think.

397
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:41.230
And I wish we thought that way.

398
00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:46.410
I think we've to internalized libertarian economics as a model for everything

399
00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:50.890
that like it's always virtuous to destroy this thing and build something new.

400
00:21:50.891 --> 00:21:53.020
And what we don't understand is like that's not,

401
00:21:53.021 --> 00:21:55.840
people are not capable of that on,
on at scale,

402
00:21:55.990 --> 00:22:00.520
like 325 million people can't deal with tearing down in remaking the society.

403
00:22:00.521 --> 00:22:02.620
Every generation.
They just can't,
they'll go crazy.

404
00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:08.280
And so we need to identify the things that we want to preserve and actively work

405
00:22:08.411 --> 00:22:11.080
to preserve them.
And,
and I would start with the bill of rights.

406
00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:14.690
<v 1>So do you think any of the people right here,
these beautiful characters,</v>

407
00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:19.170
your character's Maxine waters and Mitch Mcconnell and Nancy Pelosi,

408
00:22:19.171 --> 00:22:22.660
who else do we have on there?
I'm upside down.
Hillary Clinton.
Bill Kristol.

409
00:22:22.661 --> 00:22:27.180
Bill Chris Stover.
Yeah.
Bayzos is this,
I'm upside down here.

410
00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:29.160
That's Lindsey.
Lindsey Graham.
Oh,
well,
okay.

411
00:22:29.161 --> 00:22:31.440
So I actually wanted to sort of get Lindsey into this somehow.

412
00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:34.590
He's a little Pudgy,
are there than in real life.
Um,

413
00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:38.140
he's become sort of like a,
like a star said elite.

414
00:22:38.141 --> 00:22:42.150
Like what do you make of sort of these republicans that like even Mitch

415
00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:45.630
Mcconnell,
like they seem like they've got a little juice at the moment.
Kevin,

416
00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:46.950
our thing did something,

417
00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:49.760
<v 0>well,
they did the right thing and they are on the cover of my book,</v>

418
00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:53.950
not because of that or any real political reason.
Um,

419
00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:56.820
particularly Lindsey Graham is there and it's described inside the,

420
00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.840
he's the embodiment.
And I like Lindsey Graham and I think he's smart,

421
00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:03.320
but he's the embodiment of a phenomenon that I think is really destructive,

422
00:23:03.321 --> 00:23:08.321
which is the refusal of people to learn from the failures that they created.

423
00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:14.480
And so like,
it's okay to have supported the invasion of Iraq.
I did.

424
00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:19.490
What's not okay is to 17,
you know,
15 years later look at it and be like,

425
00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:24.800
no,
that wasn't a mistake.
And No,
I refuse to learn from what happened.
And yes,

426
00:23:24.801 --> 00:23:26.810
I think we should do it again like that.

427
00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:30.050
That's something for which you should be held responsible.
That's my only point.

428
00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:31.910
It's like I catch my kid's doing something wrong.

429
00:23:31.911 --> 00:23:33.710
I'm not surprised that they did something wrong,

430
00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:39.160
but I demand that they can see they did something wrong and I make them try and

431
00:23:39.171 --> 00:23:41.380
learn from it.
That's just basic.
Yeah.

432
00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:43.250
<v 1>All right,
so let's do a,</v>

433
00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:46.940
I know there's nothing that people in television doing more than predictions.

434
00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:49.270
We got intellectual

435
00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:51.110
<v 0>because I don't like accountability is the problem.</v>

436
00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:54.420
<v 1>All right,
so you seem pretty open to this.
So,
uh,
look,</v>

437
00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:58.650
I had Glen back on last week.
He was great.
He was,
look,

438
00:23:58.651 --> 00:24:02.190
this is a guy who if you haven't sat down with them and allow you,
okay,
good.

439
00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:07.470
Like this is a guy who admits freely admits now that he was part of the problem,

440
00:24:08.341 --> 00:24:13.110
that he was one of the people that led to the polarization and he's trying to

441
00:24:13.111 --> 00:24:16.200
fix it.
Yes.
I can't,
you know,
people will say,
well his motives,

442
00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:20.400
he just wants whatever money it,
it's like people's made.
Oh yeah.

443
00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:21.870
And I don't want to attack people.
Yes.

444
00:24:21.871 --> 00:24:24.420
If you repeatedly show me that your motives are bad side,

445
00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:29.470
but I see a guy who genuinely trying to fix some things.
Um,

446
00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:31.560
so when I discussed this with him about the midterms,

447
00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:35.790
we sort of agreed basically that the only option that I see that is remotely

448
00:24:35.791 --> 00:24:39.060
possible here for the betterment of the country going forward,

449
00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:43.680
the Democrats kind of have to be destroyed so that they can rebuild.

450
00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:46.800
I don't otherwise,
if they do well in these midterms,

451
00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:50.310
we ended up in two years of impeachment and then it's like that,

452
00:24:50.311 --> 00:24:52.560
that revolution thing that you think we're on the brink of.

453
00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:55.730
<v 0>I agree with that.</v>

454
00:24:55.970 --> 00:25:00.970
And the reason is not because Trump is inconvenienced or impeached or whatever

455
00:25:01.911 --> 00:25:06.911
the reason is that the problems that led to Trump's ascent are unaddressed.

456
00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:09.890
I mean that's,
that's you know,
the,

457
00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:14.060
the dying of the middle classes is the core problem and no one is talking about

458
00:25:14.061 --> 00:25:15.350
it.
And Trump,

459
00:25:15.351 --> 00:25:19.790
I have to say sometimes makes it easier not to talk about it because he seeks to

460
00:25:19.791 --> 00:25:23.630
be the person people talk about anyway.
You know,
the problem.
Um,
yeah,

461
00:25:23.631 --> 00:25:27.080
I mean I think the ideas need to be repudiated really clearly.

462
00:25:27.081 --> 00:25:31.970
Like you don't win when you say that the guilty have an obligation to prove

463
00:25:31.971 --> 00:25:34.330
their innocence.
I'm sorry.
We're not rewarding that.

464
00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:34.870
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

465
00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:39.870
W was that the ultimate like sort of just obvious way this all was going to go

466
00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:41.260
like everything with identity,

467
00:25:41.261 --> 00:25:44.500
politics and everything else and believe all women or because when you grew up

468
00:25:44.501 --> 00:25:48.250
everybody,
you can't have anybody that wanders.
Like,

469
00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:52.120
so the cabinet thing really was kind of the like did it seem obvious to you?

470
00:25:52.121 --> 00:25:55.150
It seemed obvious to me.
That's what it felt like.
The way the reaction

471
00:25:55.710 --> 00:26:00.610
<v 0>bully obvious.
And I mean,
I got caught up.
I mean,
I say it's obvious,</v>

472
00:26:00.611 --> 00:26:03.640
but I also got caught up as I always do in my sort of literal like,

473
00:26:03.641 --> 00:26:04.600
but wait a second,

474
00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:08.020
what about Ted Kennedy or whatever when I should've been far more sophisticated

475
00:26:08.021 --> 00:26:09.370
in just said,
yeah,
what you just said,

476
00:26:09.371 --> 00:26:11.800
which is of course they're doing this because they have to do it.

477
00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:17.280
And this is kind of the logical apogee of identity politics anyway,

478
00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:20.200
that no one is really human.

479
00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:24.190
We're all just sort of component parts of a larger whole of a group.

480
00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:28.750
And we have to act as a member of a group.
We can never act alone.

481
00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:34.210
Um,
you know,
our,
our unique humanity cannot be acknowledged.
I mean,
you must,

482
00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:37.390
you,
yeah,
you must deal with this all the time.
Yeah.
I mean,

483
00:26:37.391 --> 00:26:39.910
I'm like a straight white man,
so like,
you know,
whatever,

484
00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:44.170
I guess I'm acting according to type,
but if you're not,
you know,
you know,

485
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:46.980
so anyway,
you know exactly I'm talking about it's,
yes.

486
00:26:46.981 --> 00:26:49.770
And I should have known that of course.
But the point is,

487
00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:53.190
I don't think that most people buy that or want to buy.

488
00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:57.870
They don't want to live in that country where you're required by your DNA to act

489
00:26:57.871 --> 00:27:01.200
a certain way.
Like what?
So what makes you different from a robot at that point?

490
00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:01.820
And these are them,

491
00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:05.150
<v 1>the exact same people who are now defending Elizabeth Warren,
of course,</v>

492
00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:09.520
could not be more fraudulent in which is,
have you had any,

493
00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:12.610
have you had a native American tribes?
Men or a Gore?
Yeah.

494
00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:14.490
<v 0>Gorgeous.
I mean,
I have to say,</v>

495
00:27:14.491 --> 00:27:18.330
I think that story for me has been a happy respite from all this heavy stuff

496
00:27:18.331 --> 00:27:22.260
cause it's just so hilarious.
Oh yeah.
How loud is it for Joe Smith and Warren is,

497
00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:24.990
but I do think there's a deep question at the bottom of it.

498
00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:27.660
Not even at the bottom,
at the very top of it,
which is like,

499
00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:29.970
should your DNA determine your life?

500
00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:33.390
And maybe I'm just too American or too California or something.
But no,

501
00:27:33.391 --> 00:27:36.360
I don't think it should.
I don't think you're responsible for what people,

502
00:27:36.361 --> 00:27:39.210
you never met you.
I think you're responsible for the decisions that you make.

503
00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:43.050
I don't think we should hurt you because of your eye color or your height or

504
00:27:43.051 --> 00:27:44.860
your race.
I mean like if,

505
00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:49.920
if you start to accept that it's okay to inflict group punishment on groups,

506
00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:54.900
then like,

507
00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:58.350
I mean isn't that the whole lesson of the 20th century that that's wrong and

508
00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:00.990
that's a culdesac that ends in bloodshed.
Yes.

509
00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:05.680
So why are we accepting this and everyday on TV,
one of the main pros,

510
00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:06.181
last thing I'll say,

511
00:28:06.181 --> 00:28:10.290
but one of the main problems with our coverage is that it's brought to us by

512
00:28:10.291 --> 00:28:13.410
dumb people and I really think finance,

513
00:28:13.411 --> 00:28:16.920
the whole finance world is partly to blame 40 years ago,

514
00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:20.880
like Smart Evan Thomas from Newsweek lives used to live on my street.
I haven't.

515
00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:24.810
Thomas a very smart guy went to Harvard,
you know,
he's kind of liberal,
whatever,

516
00:28:24.811 --> 00:28:28.200
but he's legitimately smart,
smarter than I am.

517
00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:31.980
He left Harvard and went to work at Newsweek because that was kind of an

518
00:28:31.981 --> 00:28:33.300
acceptable path.

519
00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:37.700
Now what percentage of Harvard seniors are going to Newsweek?
Another.

520
00:28:37.701 --> 00:28:40.830
They're going into private equity.
So what's you're left with this,
it's almost,

521
00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:42.930
it's almost like medieval England where the,
you know,

522
00:28:42.931 --> 00:28:46.350
under private sure that the first son gets the estate and the second son has to

523
00:28:46.351 --> 00:28:49.200
like figure it out or becoming a army officer,
a vicar or something.

524
00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:52.980
It's like we're getting the dumb people were getting the,
you know,

525
00:28:52.981 --> 00:28:56.040
people who can't think for themselves or all of a sudden winding up his cable

526
00:28:56.041 --> 00:28:59.070
news anchors.
It's like,
what?
Do you know what I mean?

527
00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:03.510
<v 1>I do know what you mean.
That's why I,
that's why I'm on youtube with all the,</v>

528
00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:07.410
were going smart of you to,
if you know what I mean.
Listen man,

529
00:29:07.411 --> 00:29:11.370
you know the first video that I did in a in 2018 was a that I thought this was

530
00:29:11.371 --> 00:29:14.220
going to be the year of unusual alliances and I would say,

531
00:29:14.221 --> 00:29:18.300
I would say this is right up there because I consider this a a great alliance

532
00:29:18.301 --> 00:29:20.490
and I think you're doing great work and all that stuff.
Not that you need.
Yeah.

533
00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:24.060
<v 0>Look anybody that,
it's really simple.
If you it,</v>

534
00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:28.890
if you feel a moral obligation to scream at people in restaurants,

535
00:29:28.891 --> 00:29:31.920
if you disagree with their political views,
you're not on my side.

536
00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:35.980
And if you don't,
you are.
So it's like I don't,
you know what I mean?

537
00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:39.300
This is such an intense moment.
It's thrown everything into stark relief.

538
00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:44.260
I just care about aligning myself with people who believe in the individual and

539
00:29:44.261 --> 00:29:48.940
freedom of expression,
period.
I hear you brother.
And for more on Tucker,

540
00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:53.020
watch your mind,
Tucker Carlson Tonight at 8:00 PM eastern on Fox News.
