00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.880
It's been over a year since I
last did a video with the

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.420
differential equations playlist,
and I thought I

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.370
would start kicking up, making
a couple of videos.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.840
And I think where I left,
I said that I would do a

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.340
non-homogenous linear equation
using the Laplace Transform.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.040
So let's do one, as a bit of a
warm-up, now that we've had

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.050
a-- or at least I've had
a one-year hiatus.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:21.660
Maybe you're watching these
continuously, so you're

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.040
probably more warmed
up than I am.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:31.500
So if we have the equation the
second derivative of y plus y

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.820
is equal to sine of 2t.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.750
And we're given some initial
conditions here.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.190
The initial conditions are y
of 0 is equal to 2, and y

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.880
prime of 0 is equal to 1.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.250
And where we left off--
and now you

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.090
probably remember this.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.570
You probably recently watched
the last video.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:56.940
To solve these, we just
take the Laplace

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.480
Transforms of all the sides.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.540
We solve for the Laplace
Transform of the function.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:03.990
Then we take the inverse
Laplace Transform.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.530
If that doesn't make sense, then
let's just do it in this

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.390
video, and hopefully
the example

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.190
will clarify all confusion.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.650
So in the last video-- it was
either the last one or the

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.460
previous one-- I showed you that
the Laplace Transform of

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.360
the second derivative of y is
equal to s squared times the

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.210
Laplace Transform of y-- and we
keep lowering the degree on

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.540
s-- so minus s times y of 0.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.530
You can kind of think of it
as taking the derivative.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.510
This is an integral.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.260
It's not exactly the
anti-derivative of this.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.330
But the Laplace Transform
it is an integral.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.290
The Transform is an integral.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.530
So y of 0 is kind of one
derivative away from that.

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.400
And then minus y prime of 0.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.940
And then we could also
rewrite this.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.270
And this is just a purely
notational issue.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.300
I could write this, instead of
writing the Laplace Transform

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.600
of y all the time, I could write
this as s squared times

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.600
capital Y of s-- because this
is going to be a function of

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:12.700
s, not a function of y-- minus
s times y of 0 minus

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.670
y prime y of 0.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.510
These are going to be
numbers, right?

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:17.420
These aren't functions.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.500
These are the function evaluated
at 0, or the

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.190
derivative of the function
evaluated at 0.

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.690
And we know what these
values are.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.910
y of 0, right here, is 2,
and y prime of 0 is 1.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.340
It was given to us.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.740
So if we take the Laplace
Transforms of both sides of

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.940
this equation, first we're
going to want to take the

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.950
Laplace Transform of this term
right there, which we've

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:40.700
really just done.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.960
The Laplace Transform of the
second derivative is s squared

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.620
times the Laplace Transform of
the function, which we write

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.690
as capital Y of s, minus this,
minus 2s-- they gave us that

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.900
initial condition--
and then minus 1.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:02.660
Right?

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.770
This term right here is
just 1, so minus 1.

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.560
So that's term right there.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.490
Then we want to take
the Laplace

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.380
Transform of y by itself.

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.100
So this is just plus Y of
s, right, the Laplace

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.150
Transform of y.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.110
So I'll just rewrite Laplace
Transform of y.

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.500
I'm just rewriting it
in this notation.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.200
Y of S.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.230
It's good to get used
to either one.

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.060
This is going to be equal
to the Laplace

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.470
Transform of sine of 2t.

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.930
And I showed you in a video last
year that we showed what

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.740
the Laplace Transform of sine
of at is, but I'll write it

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.690
down here just so
you remember it.

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:49.170
Laplace Transform of the sine
of at is equal to a over s

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.325
squared plus a squared.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:02.220
So the Laplace Transform
of sine of 2t.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.380
Here, a is 2.

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.140
This is going to be 2 over
s squared plus 4.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.080
So if we take the Laplace
Transform of both sides of

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.630
this, the right-hand side
is going to be 2 over s

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.589
squared plus 4.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:19.390
Now what we can do is we can
separate out all the Y of s

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.240
terms. And so we can factor,
well I guess we could say,

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.270
factor out their coefficients,
so that's a Y of s term,

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.920
that's a Y of s term.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.170
And so we could write the
left-hand side here as s

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:34.610
squared-- that's that term--
plus 1-- the coefficient on

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.685
that term-- s squared plus
1, times Y of s.

00:04:39.685 --> 00:04:41.600
Let me do it in green.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:47.450
So this is Y of s, and this Y
of s, times Y of s, and then

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:51.900
we have the non-Y of s terms.
These two right here.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:58.770
So minus 2s, minus 1, is equal
to 2 over s squared plus 4.

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.490
We can add 2s plus 1 to both
sides, to essentially move

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:08.320
this to the right-hand side, and
we're left with s squared

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:20.390
plus 1, times Y of s, is equal
to 2 over s squared plus 4,

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:24.750
plus 2s, plus 1.

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.010
Now we can divide both sides of
this equation by s squared

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:32.630
plus 1, and we get the Laplace
Transform of Y.

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:39.130
Y of s is equal to-- let me
switch colors-- it's equal to

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:45.880
2 over s squared plus 4 times
this thing right here.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.890
I'm dividing both sides of this
equation by this term

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:49.540
right there.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.160
So times s squared plus 1-- it's
in the denominator so I'm

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:59.530
dividing by it-- plus 2s plus
1-- I have to divide both of

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.810
those terms by the s squared
plus 1-- divided by s squared

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:09.290
plus 1, divided by
s squared plus 1.

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:11.830
Now, in order to be able to
take the inverse Laplace

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.350
Transform of this, I need to get
it in some type of simple

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:16.310
fraction form.

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.070
These are actually easier to
do, but this was one's a

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.810
little bit difficult.

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:21.790
I want to do some partial
fraction decomposition to

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:25.380
break this up into maybe
simpler fractions.

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.120
So what I want to do, I'm going
to do a little bit of an

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.100
aside here.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.890
And this really is the hardest
part of these problems. The

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:34.140
algebra, breaking
this thing up.

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.780
So I'm going to break this up.

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:37.940
So let me write this this way.

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:45.080
2 over s squared plus 4 times
s squared plus 1.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.660
I'm going to break this
up into two fractions.

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.410
This is the partial fraction
decomposition.

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:52.660
One fraction is s
squared plus 4.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.420
And the other fraction
is s squared plus 1.

00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:02.110
And since both of these
denominators are of degree 2,

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:06.080
the numerators are going
to be of degree 1.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.690
So they're going to be some--
let me write it this way--

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:12.630
this one will be As plus B.

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:16.520
And then this one will
be Cs plus D.

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:17.970
This is just pure algebra.

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:20.130
This is just partial fraction
decomposition.

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:22.320
I've made a couple
of videos on it.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.760
And I'm saying that I'm assuming
that this expression

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.330
right here can be broken
up into two

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:28.790
expressions of this form.

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:31.860
And I need to solve for
A, B, C, and D.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:32.940
So let's see how
we can do that.

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:36.310
So if I were to start with these
two and add them up,

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:37.470
what do I get?

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:40.820
I would have to multiply these
times-- so my denominator, my

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:46.040
common denominator, would be
this thing again-- it would be

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:53.530
s squared plus 4 times
s squared plus 1.

00:07:53.530 --> 00:08:00.180
And now I'm going to have to
multiply the As plus B times

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:01.623
this s squared plus 1.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.870
This, as it is right now,
these two terms

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:07.420
would cancel out.

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:09.070
You'll just get this term,
but I need to add it

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:10.940
to this right here.

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:24.970
So you get plus Cs plus D
times s squared plus 4.

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:27.660
And now let's see what we could
do to match up the terms

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:29.810
here with this number
2 right here.

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:31.650
So let's multiply
all of this out.

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:39.780
So As times s squared
is As to the 3rd.

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:43.630
As times 1 is plus As.

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:48.620
B times s squared, so plus Bs
squared, and then you have B

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:51.690
times 1 is plus B.

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:54.525
And then you have Cs times s
squared, that's Cs to the 3rd.

00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:02.025
And then Cs times 4,
so it's plus 4Cs.

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:08.240
These problems are tiring.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:11.560
And I also have a cold, so this
is especially tiring, but

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.410
I'll soldier forward.

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:14.150
Where was I?

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:16.200
So I multiplied the C's times
each of these, now I have to

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.040
multiply the D's.

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:22.210
So plus Ds squared-- that's D
times that one-- plus D times

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:24.910
4, so plus 4D.

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:25.950
So that's all of them.

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:28.600
And I just wrote it this way
so I have the common degree

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.460
terms under each other.

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:35.140
So if I were to add the entire
numerator, I get-- and I'll

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:42.100
just switch colors, somewhat
arbitrarily-- I get A plus C

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:46.580
times s to the 3rd plus-- let
me write the s squared term

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:51.510
next-- plus B plus D times s
squared-- now I'll write this

00:09:51.510 --> 00:10:01.760
s term-- plus A plus 4C times
s plus B plus 4D.

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:02.870
This is just the numerator.

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:04.710
This is when I just added
these two things up.

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:10.300
This whole thing up here
simplifies to this.

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:13.030
I don't know if the word
simplify is appropriate.

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:15.730
But it becomes this expression
right here.

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:16.960
And that's just the numerator.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.880
The denominator is still what
we had written before.

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:23.240
The denominator is still the s
squared plus 4, times the s

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.130
squared plus 1.

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:28.720
Of course, I have to show
that this is a fraction.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.100
And this is going to be equal
to this thing over here.

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:39.030
2 over s squared plus 4 times
s squared plus 1.

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:43.380
Now, why did I go through this
whole mess right here?

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:45.110
Well, the reason why I went
through it is because we

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:48.100
should be able to solve
for A, B, C, and D.

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:50.600
So let's see, A plus C.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.490
This is the coefficient
on the s cubed term.

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:54.850
Do we see any s cubed
terms here?

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:56.820
No, we see no s cubed
terms here.

00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:02.180
So A plus C-- let me write this
down-- A plus C must be

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:03.900
equal to 0, because we
see nothing here that

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:05.990
has an s to the third.

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:08.690
B plus D is a coefficient
on the s squared term.

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:10.720
Do we see any s squared
terms here?

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.120
No, so B plus D must
be equal to 0.

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:23.260
A plus 4C are the coefficient
of the s term.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.500
I see no s term over here.

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:35.310
So A plus 4C must also
be equal to 0.

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:40.000
And then finally, we look at
just the constant terms. And

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.930
we do have a constant term
on the left-hand

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:42.890
side of this equation.

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:44.040
We have 2.

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:48.700
so B plus 4D-- I didn't want to
make it that thick-- B plus

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:53.295
4D must be equal to 2.

00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:00.420
This just seems like these
linear equations are pretty

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:01.720
easy to solve for.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:06.150
Let's subtract this from this.

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:08.780
So A-- or let me subtract the
bottom one from the top one--

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:11.700
so A minus A, that's 0A.

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:17.290
And then C minus 4C minus
3C is equal to 0.

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:20.210
And so you get C
is equal to 0.

00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:23.130
If C is equal to 0, A plus C
is equals to 0, A must be

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:25.810
equal to 0.

00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:27.460
And let's do the same
thing here.

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:29.890
Let's subtract this from that.

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:35.610
So you get B minus B is 0, and
then minus 3D-- that's just D

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:39.900
minus 4D-- and then 0 minus
2 is equal to minus 2.

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:48.080
And then you get D is equal to--
what do we get?-- D is

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:50.080
equal to 2/3.

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:58.670
Minus 2 divided by minus 3 is
2/3, and then-- this isn't a

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:01.100
minus here, I wrote that there
later-- we said B plus D is

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:01.900
equal to 0.

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:04.370
So B must be the opposite
of D, right?

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:08.580
We could write B is equal
to minus D, or B is

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:11.150
equal to minus 2/3.

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:14.510
Let's remember all of this and
go back to our original

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:17.510
problem, because we've
kind of-- actually

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:18.660
let me just be clear.

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:26.110
We can rewrite 2 over s
squared plus 4 times s

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:28.150
squared plus 1.

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:32.750
We can rewrite this as, well,
A is 0, B is minus 2/3.

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:39.710
So this is equal to minus 2/3
over s squared plus 4.

00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:42.450
And then C is 0, we
figured that out.

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:44.590
And then D is 2/3.

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:51.530
So plus 2/3 over s
squared plus 1.

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:55.300
So all of that work that I just
did, that was just to

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:57.890
break up this piece
right here.

00:13:57.890 --> 00:13:59.640
That was just to break up
that piece right there.

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:01.320
And then, of course, we have
these other two pieces here

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:02.820
that we can't forget about.

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:05.550
So after all of this work,
what do we have?

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:06.470
And I'm going to make
sure I don't make a

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:08.390
careless mistake here.

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:14.390
We get the Laplace Transform
of Y-- as you can see, the

00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:20.670
algebra is the hardest part
here-- is equal to this first

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:23.930
term-- I'm just going back--
this first term, which I've

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:27.880
now decomposed into this.

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:32.850
So it's minus-- let me write it
this way-- minus 1/3-- and

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:34.820
I think you're going to see in
a second why I'm writing this

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:45.270
way-- minus 1/3 times 2 over s
squared plus 4, and then plus

00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:51.600
2/3 times 1 over s
squared plus 1.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:52.400
And you're probably saying,
Sal, why are you

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.470
writing it this way?

00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:56.250
Well you can already immediately
see that this is

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:59.030
the Laplace Transform
of sine of 2t.

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:01.530
This is the Laplace Transform
of sine of t.

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:03.750
So I wanted to write this 2
here, because this is 2, this

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:04.370
is 2 squared.

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:05.860
This is 1, this is 1 squared.

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:07.760
So I wanted to write
it in this form.

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:08.910
This was just the first term.

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:11.400
We have two more terms
to worry about.

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:12.770
I don't want to make
a careless mistake.

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:15.710
I have 2s over s
squared plus 1.

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:18.420
So let me write that down.

00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:31.350
So plus 2 times s over s squared
plus 1, plus-- last

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:34.730
one-- plus 1 over s
squared plus 1.

00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:45.670
Now we just take the inverse
Laplace Transform of the whole

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:49.330
thing, and then we'll
know what Y is.

00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:56.080
So, you know, just to remember
the Laplace Transform.

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.345
So this is going to be
a little inverse.

00:15:57.345 --> 00:15:59.210
This is going to
be sine of 2t.

00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:01.410
Let me just write, just so we
have it here, so you know I'm

00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:03.090
not doing some type of voodoo.

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:09.210
The Laplace Transform of sine
of at is equal to a over s

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:11.220
squared plus a squared.

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:17.910
And the Laplace Transform of
cosine of at is equal to s

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:19.720
over s squared plus a squared.

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:21.540
Let's just remember those two
things when we take the

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:25.680
inverse Laplace Transform of
both sides of this equation.

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:28.140
The inverse Laplace Transform of
the Laplace Transform of y,

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:30.540
well that's just y.

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:35.010
y-- maybe I'll write it as a
function of t-- is equal to--

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:38.210
well this is the Laplace
Transform of sine of 2t.

00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:40.730
You can just do some pattern
matching right here.

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:43.450
If a is equal to 2, then this
would be the Laplace Transform

00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:44.520
of sine of 2t.

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:55.800
So it's minus 1/3 times sine of
2t plus 2/3 times-- this is

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:57.310
the Laplace Transform
of sine of t.

00:16:57.310 --> 00:17:00.100
If you just make a is equal
to 1, sine of t's Laplace

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:02.440
Transform is 1 over
s squared plus 1.

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:08.140
So plus 2/3 times the sine of
t-- let me do the next one in

00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:12.430
blue, just because it was
already written in blue-- plus

00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:15.780
2 times-- this is the Laplace
Transform of cosine of t.

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:19.079
If you make a is equal to 1,
then the cosine t Laplace

00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:21.140
Transform is s over
s squared plus 1.

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:27.980
So 2 times cosine of t-- and
then one last term-- plus--

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:30.150
this is just like this one over
here, this is just the

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:35.470
Laplace Transform of sine
of t-- plus sine of t.

00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:36.570
And we're almost done.

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:38.270
We're essentially done, but
there's a little bit more

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:40.290
simplification we can do.

00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:43.820
I have 2/3 times the sign of t
here, and then I have another

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:48.810
1 sine of t here, so I can
add the 2/3 to the 1.

00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:51.610
What's 2/3 plus 1, or 3/3?

00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:52.610
It's 5/3.

00:17:52.610 --> 00:18:01.270
So I can write y of t is equal
to minus 1/3 sine of 2t plus--

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:03.430
these two terms I'm just
going to add up--

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:07.720
plus 5/3 sine of t.

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:13.350
And then I have this last term
here, plus 2cosine of t.

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:15.950
So this was a hairy problem,
a lot of work.

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:18.340
And we saw that the hardest
part really was just the

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:21.700
partial fraction decomposition
that we did up here, not

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:23.110
making any careless mistakes.

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:25.900
But at the end, we got a pretty
neat answer that's not

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:33.060
too complicated, that satisfies
this non-homogenous

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:34.420
differential equation.

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:36.540
We were able to incorporate
the boundary

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:38.450
conditions as we did it.

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:43.185
Anyway, hopefully you found
that vaguely satisfying.

00:18:43.185 --> 00:18:45.770
This is a good warm-up
after a year of no

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:47.020
differential equations.
