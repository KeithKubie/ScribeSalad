Well, you might know this from experience--personal experience.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
And remember, physics always has to be in line with your personal experience, right?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
This building is the most likely. It's the tallest.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The electric field around here is stronger than the electric field around here.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And in fact, the reason why lightning actually occurs is because the electric field

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
exceeds some threshold strength.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Once the electric field is sufficiently high, that's when lightning can strike.

00:00:24.000 --> 99:59:59.000
And a lightning strike can lead to fire and other disasters. That's what we want to avoid.
