00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Unfortunately, the world did not begin the New Year in peace, but in distress. 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
In my view, particularly the Middle East has been the main issue so far. 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
The leaders of the world have been late in paying attention to the Middle East. 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:46.000
In spite of the recent cease-fire declared, to ease the situation quickly, I believe that about 1300 civilians have been killed and more than 5000 have been injured in the Middle East.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
The infrastructure of Gaza has been totally destroyed. 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
The superstructure has been seriously damaged. 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:03.000
To address this, we, as world leaders, should try  to find out how we can contribute to peace in the Middle East.  

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Especially following the new presidency in the US which started on the 20th of January, I believe President Obama will interpret the Middle East issue and the peace efforts in the region in a different manner.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:32.000
As a matter of fact, I would expect that Mr. Obama will be the voice of the silent majority in the Middle East and also offer his help to those who need it in the region.  

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Here I would like to state that the Republic of Turkey is always ready to do its utmost to contribute to the peace efforts in the Middle East. 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And I hope that Davos will pave the way for significant changes in the peace efforts of the world.
