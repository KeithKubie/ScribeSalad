SHAUNA: I am very
happy to introduce

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.125
Malachi Rempen, the
creator of the web

00:00:11.125 --> 00:00:12.750
comic "Itchy Feet."
itchyfeetcomic.com.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.790
Malachi is from
the US originally

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:20.880
but now he lives in Berlin.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.235
And his wife is Italian
and also lives in Berlin.

00:00:24.235 --> 00:00:26.860
So they have a lot of experience
with being expats and language

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:27.560
learning.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.850
So the comic is about
travel and language learning

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.720
and occasionally
life as an expat.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.660
So it seems logical
that this should

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.300
be interesting to this audience
because many, many people here

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.410
are experts and
most have learned

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.140
one foreign language at least,
most of the time at least two.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.584
So maybe for some background,
I'm a fan of this comic.

00:00:47.584 --> 00:00:50.000
And I thought it made sense
that other Googlers should be.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.410
And it turns out they are
because a fellow Googler sees

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.620
one of the comics that is posted
about Zurich and he writes,

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.140
oh hey, if you're
ever in Zurich,

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.520
you should look me up and
come down to the office

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.481
and I can give you
a tour of Google.

00:01:02.481 --> 00:01:04.105
And then I jumped on
the comment thread

00:01:04.105 --> 00:01:06.021
and I said, oh, yeah,
yeah, how about you come

00:01:06.021 --> 00:01:07.120
and give a talk at Google?

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.891
And to both of our
surprise and delight,

00:01:08.891 --> 00:01:10.140
Malachi replies to the thread.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.290
He says, yeah, OK.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.729
So here he is and I will let
him do the rest of the speaking.

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:20.020
MALACHI REMPEN: Thanks, Shauna.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.086
Everyone hear me all right?

00:01:27.086 --> 00:01:27.586
Right on.

00:01:31.044 --> 00:01:32.450
Got my notes.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:33.360
Cool.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.380
So, yeah, as Shauna said,
I'm Malachi Ray Rempen.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.680
I do "Itchy Feet," the
travel and language comic.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.300
How many of you here
have seen or heard of it?

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.250
Are you kidding me?

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.920
All right.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.630
Good point.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.830
Well, that's all right.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.900
I want the hand count
to be high in my head

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.720
so I can be like, yeah, cool.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.590
So I was actually born in
Geneva, not far from here.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.010
But I only lived there for
like a year or so and then

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.860
my family, we moved
to New Mexico,

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.360
where I grew up in Albuquerque.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.450
And then I went to
film school in L.A.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.230
That's what I do professionally,
I'm a freelance filmmaker.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.130
And comics were always
ever just a hobby for me.

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.910
It was never something that
I wanted to do professionally

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.430
or anything like that.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.875
But I'm not here talking
at Google for my movies.

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.120
But what I did want
to talk about--

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.036
and I'm going to go
through some of the comics

00:02:40.036 --> 00:02:42.200
that I've done some of
the stories behind them

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.879
and some of the
problems that I've

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:47.295
had with certain ones and sort
of things that I've learned

00:02:47.295 --> 00:02:49.540
and most of all, what
I ended up learning

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.280
more about storytelling and
more about creative endeavors

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.962
and what it means to
be creative and art

00:02:55.962 --> 00:02:58.420
through this comic than I ever
did through any of the films

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.253
or through film school
or any of that stuff.

00:03:00.253 --> 00:03:04.980
So I want to share some of
that stuff with you guys.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.777
So after L.A., I
moved to France.

00:03:08.777 --> 00:03:10.610
I lived-- we lived in
Lyons and I went there

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.980
for a girl-- somebody
who may or may not

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.160
be at the back of the room.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:22.587
And my then girlfriend, now
wife, Iris, she was studying,

00:03:22.587 --> 00:03:23.920
doing her Erasmus program there.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.080
And I thought, well,
I'll come along.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.580
France.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:27.080
Why not?

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.560
L.A. sucks.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.832
And I wanted to--
it was my first time

00:03:31.832 --> 00:03:33.290
living outside the
country I wanted

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.680
to have some way of chronicling
what was happening to me

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.096
and the things
that were going on.

00:03:37.096 --> 00:03:39.430
But something to send
my mom every week

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.070
that I could sort of explain
like what life is like.

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.700
But I didn't want
to just do a blog

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.940
or like to send a
really long email.

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.400
And I had always doodled as
a kid on papers and stuff,

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.430
so I thought, well,
I'll just do a comic.

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.660
And oh, yeah, here's me
being interested in movies.

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.560
A side note that will
be important later,

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.690
I was always into sort of
the big fantasy movies.

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.402
Like I was always into the "Star
Wars" and into "The Matrix"

00:04:06.402 --> 00:04:07.110
when I was a kid.

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.443
And then as I got older, like
the Coen brothers, the Wes

00:04:09.443 --> 00:04:11.020
Anderson, like the
people who were

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.769
building worlds who
were making these sort

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:15.160
of fantastical things.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.535
I was never really into realism.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.839
That aside, back
to the main story.

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:24.680
I started "Le Spleen en France,"
which was the original title.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.550
And originally, the
guy was a spleen.

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:27.910
And all the characters
were little body organs.

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.280
There was like a
heart, and an eyeball,

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.540
and a pancreas, these things.

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.462
But it just got irritating
to draw a pancreas.

00:04:34.462 --> 00:04:36.670
And anyway, a spleen doesn't
look anything like that.

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.170
So I just ended up
being a [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.330
But you'll see in some of
the early comics, that's

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.990
where that comes from.

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.900
And originally, the comics were
just about my very personal

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:49.839
experiences.

00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:52.130
Like I said, like you would
write to a friend or family

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.630
member.

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.940
Like this is what
happened to me this week.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.860
So this was the
first comic I did.

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.630
Can you read the-- how's that?

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:59.380
Is that all right?

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.174
Yeah, that's all right.

00:05:01.174 --> 00:05:02.090
So this was the first.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.930
It was just about like, you
bone up on your foreign language

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.780
and then you try it out and
then you just sort of freeze up.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.995
I'm sure a lot of you-- how
many of you here are Swiss?

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.800
So you haven't had that problem
here in Switzerland at least.

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.770
But all the original--
here's another one

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.770
which is kind of
about when you're

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.070
for a foreigner
in a new country,

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:38.500
you sort of find yourself-- you
represent for everybody there,

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.030
like you represent
everybody from your country.

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:43.990
And you have to
answer for things

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.150
that your country has done
or cultural things that

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:48.690
might-- from
wherever you're from,

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.481
like you suddenly become
the representative

00:05:50.481 --> 00:05:52.020
of where you're from.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:59.090
And at the time when I
was in Lyons in 2011,

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.290
I guess it never
really goes away,

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:05.240
but America's always in the
news in sort of a bad way,

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.690
especially then.

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:10.777
And I always found
it a lot easier

00:06:10.777 --> 00:06:12.360
to defuse the
conversation and move on

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.230
to something that I
didn't have to answer

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:16.030
for when we talked about food.

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:17.780
Because there's nothing
that French people

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.814
love more than
talking about food--

00:06:19.814 --> 00:06:20.980
or Italians for that matter.

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:22.479
And I spent a lot
of time with both.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.460
And then this is
the last one I did,

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.954
which is just sort of
about when you come back

00:06:29.954 --> 00:06:32.120
from a really long experience
and somebody from home

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.020
asks, "how was it?"
and you go like,

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:37.350
"great," because there's
no real-- you can't explain

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:38.520
all of what it was like.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.500
You can't sort of
get across-- anyway,

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.750
they're not really interested.

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.379
They just want to
now that it was good.

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:45.670
And that was supposed to be it.

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:47.795
I was only supposed to be
in Lyons for four months,

00:06:47.795 --> 00:06:50.890
or we were, and I was supposed
to go back to the States.

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:52.240
That was in 2011.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.740
It's now 2015.

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:56.300
I haven't left Europe yet.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:02.030
And I ended up-- again, my then
girlfriend who was studying,

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:04.480
she got an opportunity to do
her field work in Morocco.

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:08.780
So I said like, yeah,
Morocco, I'm coming too.

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:11.450
I'm not going back to L.A. after
I had this great experience.

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:12.866
We ended up living
a year in Lyons

00:07:12.866 --> 00:07:17.160
and then in the spring of
2012, she went to Morocco.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.580
We went to Morocco
and I thought well,

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:22.010
I can bring back this comic.

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:26.100
I can make it a sort
of travel and exploring

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:29.430
the world kind of comic and not
just about my personal self.

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:30.960
It could be-- I
have lots of plans

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:31.760
to travel around the world.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:32.860
We can make it something bigger.

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:34.693
So it couldn't be the
"Le Spleen en France,"

00:07:34.693 --> 00:07:38.280
let's make it something a little
bit more general about travel.

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:43.254
And that became "Itchy Feet."

00:07:43.254 --> 00:07:44.670
Again, though, at
the beginning it

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:47.474
was just sort of a chronicle
of specific experiences.

00:07:47.474 --> 00:07:49.140
So this was one of
the early ones I did.

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:52.105
And if you've never had
to take a taxi from El

00:07:52.105 --> 00:07:56.070
Hoceima to Rouadi in
Morocco, you probably

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:59.679
can't relate too well
to what's going on here.

00:07:59.679 --> 00:08:01.470
It's kind of interesting
and kind of funny,

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:04.470
but there's no real
personal connection to that.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:15.280
This one comes
from-- I did notice

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.050
that when it was really
difficult to speak

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:20.200
French with French people, at
least when you're starting out

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.900
because the accent's so strong,
but also because somebody

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:25.190
speaks a language
as a native speaker,

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:27.190
you speak it in a slang way.

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:30.630
You use lots of weird
figures of speech and sort

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:32.169
of a street version
of the language.

00:08:32.169 --> 00:08:33.627
And when you're
learning it, you're

00:08:33.627 --> 00:08:37.179
learning a very academic,
proper sort of classroom version

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:38.679
of that language.

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:41.149
And they don't really mix.

00:08:41.149 --> 00:08:42.690
And anyway, you feel
like you're just

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:47.540
leagues behind a native
speaker, which you are.

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:50.330
Whereas in Morocco, because for
them, they speak fluent French,

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:54.350
but they don't speak
it as a mother tongue.

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:57.350
So they speak it a
fluent classroom French.

00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:59.590
So it's kind of a nice
place to meet halfway.

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:02.157
And this was me
trying to express

00:09:02.157 --> 00:09:04.740
that it's a lot easier to speak
a language with somebody who's

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:07.662
also learning that language
than it is to someone

00:09:07.662 --> 00:09:08.620
who's a native speaker.

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:10.300
I don't know if you
necessarily improve.

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:13.500
But these are the
first comics where

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:16.100
I was trying to express
something beyond just making

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:17.350
a funny joke about something.

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:26.050
But it doesn't always work out.

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:29.110
So at the beginning of any
cultural or artistic endeavor,

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:33.200
you're always trying to--
you're feeling out the audience.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.580
You're feeling out what
works, what doesn't work,

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:37.620
what kind of the
sense of humor is.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:40.210
And my sense of humor is not
necessarily "Itchy Feet,"

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:41.834
believe it or not.
"Itchy Feet" doesn't

00:09:41.834 --> 00:09:43.580
make me laugh that often.

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:45.840
But my sense of humor
is a lot more absurdest

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:49.704
and sort of wilder.

00:09:49.704 --> 00:09:50.870
Like this one in particular.

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:53.425
I went to Turkey, in the
region called Cappadocia,

00:09:53.425 --> 00:09:55.880
and they have these
beautiful, they're

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:59.610
called fairy towers
or fairy castle

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:03.200
abodes which are like these
ancient, naturally formed stone

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:06.042
spires that then
were carved into

00:10:06.042 --> 00:10:07.250
and people made their houses.

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:09.166
And it dates back to the
Middle Ages and such.

00:10:09.166 --> 00:10:12.586
And I thought it
was kind of funny.

00:10:12.586 --> 00:10:14.210
They looked kind of
like termite nests.

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:16.120
And so I just thought,
wow, wouldn't be funny

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:18.245
if there were actually
giant termites in there that

00:10:18.245 --> 00:10:19.962
were enslaved to people.

00:10:19.962 --> 00:10:21.920
And so I made this comic
which is exactly that.

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:23.510
And I still think
it's hilarious.

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:25.660
But it really--
nobody else-- like,

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:27.880
it didn't really
go over that well.

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.259
Not the least with
Turkish people who

00:10:30.259 --> 00:10:31.425
didn't find it funny at all.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.430
But I learned a lot from this.

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:38.280
I learned a lot
about finding sort

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.490
of what resonates with people.

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:44.050
And you learn more
from the ones that

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:46.410
fall flat than you do,
I think, from the ones

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:48.430
necessarily that
hit on the mark.

00:10:51.135 --> 00:10:53.510
Here's another example of one
where the first time people

00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:55.580
actually got angry at me.

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:59.080
I had noticed that in
Turkey-- in Germany,

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:02.010
the Turkish people often
complain, I think justifiably,

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:05.270
that they are treated like
second class citizens in a way

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:06.130
by the Germans.

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:08.110
And I had noticed it
in Turkey, that they

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:10.380
sort of just in passing,
that they kind of

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:13.814
did the same with Kurds.

00:11:13.814 --> 00:11:15.230
And so I made this
comic about it.

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:18.252
But people got upset at me.

00:11:18.252 --> 00:11:20.460
And this was the first time
I actually got hate mail.

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:24.310
And I kind of realized that I
don't know enough about this.

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:28.345
I'm not in a place to speak for
either of these two parties.

00:11:28.345 --> 00:11:30.580
I was a tourist for like
two weeks and I walk through

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:32.205
and I think I can
have something to say

00:11:32.205 --> 00:11:36.630
about this ongoing and very
deeply rooted conflict.

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:40.462
So this is the one where I
was like, I should stay away

00:11:40.462 --> 00:11:41.070
from politics.

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:43.670
I should just stick to
stuff that you know.

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:44.740
Stick to what you know.

00:11:49.356 --> 00:11:50.490
And so that's what I did.

00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:51.700
And when I moved to
Germany, I made a lot

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:52.790
about German
culture, which I felt

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:55.170
a lot more comfortable making
fun of, being half German

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:57.030
myself.

00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:59.470
And like this one
in particular, which

00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:02.510
I'm sure will resonate in
Switzerland just as well, which

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:07.510
is coming from France,
in Lyons, the red light

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:08.710
is just a suggestion.

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:13.490
The red light is just-- it's
only so that you know to look

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:14.760
for cars when you're crossing.

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:17.010
Like it's not a-- but whereas,
when I came to Germany,

00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:18.850
it was like, the
red light is law.

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:22.370
The red light is to protect you.

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:23.710
You are beholden to the light.

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:29.445
And this one was great because
I think Germans recognize

00:12:29.445 --> 00:12:30.370
this about themselves.

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:33.180
And they can recognize
this sort of funny quality

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:38.660
about the more ridiculous
in their number.

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:41.174
And I think that's
another important thing.

00:12:41.174 --> 00:12:42.590
Oh, I have another
one that's sort

00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:45.850
of along these lines, which
is actually in Switzerland.

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:48.480
Which is that I came
last summer and noticed

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:52.920
that the Swiss would
prefer not to speak

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:54.150
high German if possible.

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:58.240
Like they'd rather speak
English than speak it,

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.770
despite the fact they're very
proud, and justifiably again,

00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:03.395
very proud of the fact that they
can speak perfect high German,

00:13:03.395 --> 00:13:05.660
it's just sort of
bad on the tongue.

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:07.620
Just like eww.

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.470
And so they prefer
to speak English.

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:12.326
And I think what I
learned about doing

00:13:12.326 --> 00:13:13.700
these two comics
in particular is

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:18.570
if I'm going to make fun of
something aspect of a culture,

00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:22.790
then it's better to sort of
take it and exaggerate it

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:26.540
rather than just sort
of commenting blankly

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:27.590
on what it is.

00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:29.810
Take it, make it ridiculous,
and then you can kind of

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:30.850
see the truth behind it.

00:13:36.009 --> 00:13:37.250
All right.

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:42.910
Then I got, after
this one and others,

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:46.600
I got more into also doing more
comics about language learning.

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.960
And this was the first
one that I really got

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:52.520
a really positive feedback on.

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:59.420
And it's just about the fact
that again, Germans' English

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:01.400
is so much better
than your German

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.706
that it's just so much
easier just to speak English.

00:14:03.706 --> 00:14:04.580
Especially in Berlin.

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:06.954
It may not be the case inside
the countryside in Germany,

00:14:06.954 --> 00:14:10.020
but in Berlin where
I'm living right now,

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:13.570
you'd be hard pressed to
find a German who didn't also

00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:19.780
speak perfect English,
especially in my generation.

00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:22.060
And this was the
first time that I

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:25.900
was sort of trying to make
comics that were communicating

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:29.430
an idea and they weren't
just making a weird joke.

00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:35.560
I was trying to--
you're feeling out

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:38.510
the point at which you
and your audience meet

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:42.860
and where you can communicate
to them through a message.

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:45.427
And these are the first ones
where I was trying to do that

00:14:45.427 --> 00:14:47.510
and I was succeeding, where
I'd failed in the ones

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:48.510
that you've seen before.

00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:54.774
And this is the first time,
the first time that people

00:14:54.774 --> 00:14:56.690
said to me, people were
commenting and saying,

00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:57.995
this is so true.

00:14:57.995 --> 00:15:00.065
That's so true.

00:15:00.065 --> 00:15:01.940
And that was something
I'd heard a lot when I

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:03.189
was going through film school.

00:15:03.189 --> 00:15:06.120
Like I said, I was really into
building worlds and making

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:08.999
these sort of fantastical
things and spaceships and aliens

00:15:08.999 --> 00:15:10.540
and back in time
and stuff like that.

00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:16.880
But what people kept saying
to me, what I kept hearing

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.370
over and over is two things.

00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:19.592
One is write what you know.

00:15:19.592 --> 00:15:21.060
You hear that a lot.

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:23.820
And then the second
is tell the truth.

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:26.970
And I didn't really know what
either of those things meant.

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:30.290
How do you tell the truth if
you're making a space fantasy?

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:32.860
How do you write what
you know if you're

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:37.556
writing about dinosaurs
on Mars or whatever it is?

00:15:37.556 --> 00:15:39.430
And this was the first--
through "Itchy Feet"

00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:40.805
was the first time
that I started

00:15:40.805 --> 00:15:43.150
to understand what
tell the truth meant,

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:46.820
which is speak from
your experience.

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:49.570
Speak from your perspective
on the world and things

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:53.120
that you personally
have gone through.

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.590
Because if you
have, then there's

00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:55.810
chances are that
other people have too.

00:15:55.810 --> 00:15:57.380
And that's where
you connect people.

00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:00.990
And that's how large
space fantasies

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:02.050
are so relatable to us.

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:03.630
It's not the space fantasy part.

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:05.760
It's the human story
at the center of it

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:09.720
that we connect to
as human beings.

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:17.710
So thank you, "Itchy Feet."

00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:20.000
This one, again,
this was just sort

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.790
of a general about
how I had noticed

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:25.077
that the more you
learn of a language,

00:16:25.077 --> 00:16:26.910
the more you realize
you have left to learn.

00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:29.285
It just gets harder and harder
as the higher you climb up

00:16:29.285 --> 00:16:31.030
this hill.

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:32.780
And you realize that
your goal is actually

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:35.480
getting farther and
farther away, depending

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:37.850
on what your goal is.

00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:40.930
And the around
this time I started

00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:44.880
to see that the
comics had become

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:47.130
fairly popular within the
language learning community.

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:48.910
And this was sort of,
this became-- still

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:52.000
is today-- my bread
and butter of the comic

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
is the people who were
learning new languages.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.180
Because there wasn't
really a voice

00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:58.620
for people who were going
through that experience,

00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:01.482
at least not in comic form.

00:17:01.482 --> 00:17:04.069
And so this is when I
started to realize I

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:06.329
was not just doing
comics myself.

00:17:06.329 --> 00:17:09.359
That I was serving a
community of people.

00:17:09.359 --> 00:17:11.470
That is was something
I was doing for others.

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:14.400
And this is another
really important lesson.

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.722
And when it comes to
creative endeavors,

00:17:16.722 --> 00:17:18.280
there is a certain
element of it that

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:19.446
has to come from you, right?

00:17:19.446 --> 00:17:20.520
You have to be honest.

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:21.519
You have to be truthful.

00:17:21.519 --> 00:17:24.079
You have to write
from what you know.

00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:26.400
But it's not for you.

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:32.170
The end product of truly
resonating art or truly good

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:35.070
creative work-- not saying
that this necessarily

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:38.730
is art-- just saying
that the goal of art

00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:41.064
is to reach other people.

00:17:41.064 --> 00:17:41.980
It's for other people.

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:43.521
You're doing it to
teach other people

00:17:43.521 --> 00:17:45.940
or to reach out to other people.

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:51.510
It's about-- you're
serving not receiving,

00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:52.780
if that makes any sense.

00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:02.900
And one where this didn't go so
well, oh, yeah, well, this one.

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:05.800
This is one that was, I think,
was one of my biggest failures.

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:06.900
Again, it's a Swiss comic.

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:10.240
And the idea came from
travelling through Switzerland

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:13.240
and seeing that they
just so many lawn gnomes,

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:16.170
like in their-- especially
in the countryside.

00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:17.500
They're just everywhere.

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:19.725
Just sometimes overflowing.

00:18:19.725 --> 00:18:21.690
Like, I don't think this
drawing is necessarily

00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:23.860
an exaggeration on the first.

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:25.240
And so the joke
was kind of like,

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:28.874
oh, well, it's kind of
like a drug addiction.

00:18:28.874 --> 00:18:30.290
Like, I think
you've had too much.

00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:32.360
Like an intervention.

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:36.425
But because-- it's the first
time people going, like,

00:18:36.425 --> 00:18:40.130
I love the comic, but
I don't get this one.

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:42.970
And it was the first time that
usually, I send the comics,

00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:44.680
they go through my wife first.

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:46.340
And she laughs at them.

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:48.260
And if she laughs,
that means it goes out.

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:52.094
And if she says, I don't
get it, that means nobody's

00:18:52.094 --> 00:18:52.760
going to get it.

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:55.041
And this was the first
time she said, I don't get.

00:18:55.041 --> 00:18:57.290
And I was like, I don't think
you're right about that.

00:18:57.290 --> 00:19:00.530
Like, maybe just-- maybe
it's a language issue thing

00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:04.790
or maybe she doesn't know about
drug interventions or whatever.

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:06.750
Whatever it is, I'm
wrong and she's right.

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:11.070
And I was completely
wrong and nobody got it.

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:13.930
And so I think the important,
lesson I learned from this one,

00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:18.076
certainly is always
listen to my wife.

00:19:18.076 --> 00:19:19.450
But as far as
creative work goes,

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:20.770
to get outside perspective.

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:24.130
So sometimes you can
be very tunnel visioned

00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:29.392
and think that your perspective
is the only one that matters.

00:19:29.392 --> 00:19:30.850
And in reality,
like I said, you're

00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:32.060
doing this for other
people, so it's

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:33.940
good to have a second
voice to be like,

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:37.350
this doesn't reach me,
especially an honest one.

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:38.060
Or this one does.

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:39.768
Like and if she laughs
out loud and says,

00:19:39.768 --> 00:19:42.130
this is going to be a good
one, then it usually is.

00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:50.270
As far as perspectives go,
it can be hard sometimes--

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:51.920
can be tricky, I
wouldn't say hard--

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:55.560
but it's tricky to
represent features

00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:57.930
of other cultures
because of this fact

00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:00.860
that we all each come from
a particular perspective

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:03.130
and we all come from our
own cultural perspective.

00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:07.510
So this one was a perfectly
respectably popular strip

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:11.291
as far as my standards go, that
is about how, again, Germans

00:20:11.291 --> 00:20:12.290
speak such good English.

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:14.550
You have to go all the
way out to the countryside

00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:17.010
to find someone who you
could practice German with.

00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:20.530
And even then,
they speak English.

00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:22.340
And what I had
done with this one,

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:25.000
is you see in the
sixth panel here,

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.520
in this one here, I wanted
the name of the sign

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:32.860
to be something that was
the equivalent in English,

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:38.360
of Nowhereville or like
Podunktown or whatever.

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:42.220
Just this imaginary place where
it's in the middle of nowhere.

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:45.090
So I asked a friend in Berlin
of mine and he said, oh, yeah,

00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:47.476
we call that, we
say, "Buxtehude."

00:20:47.476 --> 00:20:48.600
So I said, fine, Buxtehude.

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:49.110
Perfect.

00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:51.330
I've done my research.

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:56.310
Put it up there and all
these people from Buxtehude

00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:58.780
started writing comments
going, like, it's not

00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:01.550
in-- you've clearly never been
to Buxtehude because it's not

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:02.260
in the Alps.

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:04.505
We're not in--
we're near Munich.

00:21:04.505 --> 00:21:06.255
It's on the sea and
we're very respectable

00:21:06.255 --> 00:21:07.550
and it's a nice big city.

00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:09.540
And I was like, I'm so sorry.

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:11.720
I had no-- I didn't
mean any offense.

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:14.740
What would you say for
the middle of nowhere?

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:19.420
And they said,
"Hintertuptingen,"

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:22.940
which is sort of
yeah, it just means--

00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:25.550
it's sort of a word that
just means back of the woods,

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:27.547
nowhere kind of a thing.

00:21:27.547 --> 00:21:29.630
But that was-- that was--
the lesson from this one

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:32.850
was definitely like,
if you don't personally

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:36.585
know for a fact that this is
the way that it is universally,

00:21:36.585 --> 00:21:38.460
especially when it comes
to cultural matters,

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:39.168
do your research.

00:21:39.168 --> 00:21:40.040
Check it twice.

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:41.856
And now I go through
every-- sometimes

00:21:41.856 --> 00:21:43.480
I have comics,
especially more recently

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:46.240
that feature a lot of
languages that I don't speak

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:47.180
or even read.

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:49.630
And so I always, like,
minimum two or three people

00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:52.750
I try and put it past them so
that they can sort of check

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:55.530
off and go like, yes,
this makes sense or no,

00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:58.560
you didn't use a dirty
word here or whatever.

00:21:58.560 --> 00:21:59.635
Because I don't know.

00:21:59.635 --> 00:22:01.695
How was I supposed
to know Buxtehude?

00:22:01.695 --> 00:22:02.820
Never heard of that before.

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:09.090
And again, this
is an earlier one.

00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:14.420
And it comes from again,
about personal experience.

00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:15.640
This didn't come from me.

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:18.052
This came from my mom who
went to India and said,

00:22:18.052 --> 00:22:19.510
like, oh, we had
these great lassis

00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:22.009
and did you know they use these
old washing machines to make

00:22:22.009 --> 00:22:22.780
the lassis with.

00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:24.320
And I thought it would
be hilarious if like, oh,

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:26.278
wouldn't it be great if
they left their laundry

00:22:26.278 --> 00:22:27.710
in the lassi washing machine.

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:30.165
Well, again, nobody--
like, people from India

00:22:30.165 --> 00:22:31.540
were commenting,
I've never heard

00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:32.623
of this in my entire life.

00:22:32.623 --> 00:22:34.490
I'm from India.

00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:37.490
And it was just that
first of all, again,

00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:39.680
it's not really
a cultural thing.

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:40.990
It's just making a dumb joke.

00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:45.190
And then also it's
not my perspective.

00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:47.020
So I stopped doing
secondhand stories.

00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:49.144
I stopped doing stories
that came from other people

00:22:49.144 --> 00:22:51.610
because I don't know what
their experience was.

00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:53.670
Maybe that was just
in this one village

00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:55.810
they make them out of
the old washing machines.

00:22:55.810 --> 00:22:57.935
Maybe it's just this one
weird old lady who did it.

00:22:57.935 --> 00:23:00.264
And unless you had been
also to these lady's house

00:23:00.264 --> 00:23:01.680
and had her lassis,
you would have

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:05.730
no way of knowing that they were
made out of washing machines.

00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:09.496
So it's always best to
rely on-- to make sure

00:23:09.496 --> 00:23:11.745
that you're grounding in
your own personal experience.

00:23:15.157 --> 00:23:16.740
And this is where
it definitely works.

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:22.040
Like this one I think that I
sort of fired on all cylinders

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:27.420
with, which is just about
how in Catalonia, they

00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:28.540
don't have Santa Claus.

00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:33.780
They have this flying
log that the kids have

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:38.530
to hit with sticks and then
it craps out their presents.

00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:41.030
And this was the first time
I didn't use a punchline

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:43.280
because it was like, I
couldn't think of anything that

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:47.330
was possibly more ridiculous
than this idea, that it

00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:49.550
was just like, just let
it exist on its own.

00:23:53.112 --> 00:23:54.570
And again with this
one I was like,

00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:56.390
this I have to do
my research on.

00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:59.020
Maybe it's just one family,
like one bizarre region

00:23:59.020 --> 00:23:59.770
that they do this.

00:23:59.770 --> 00:24:00.270
No.

00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:02.490
I've checked with Catalonians
and they're all like,

00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:04.750
we love this crazy
traditional that we do.

00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:07.560
And they have more
Christmas traditions

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:08.810
that have to do with crapping.

00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:13.700
Like that's some sort of
thing that they do there.

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:15.300
But again, checked my sources.

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:16.300
Checked multiple people.

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:17.820
Went out on Twitter going
like, everyone from Catalonia,

00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:18.330
is this true?

00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:19.788
And they were all
like, absolutely.

00:24:19.788 --> 00:24:20.830
So done.

00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:21.427
Great.

00:24:21.427 --> 00:24:22.135
And we can laugh.

00:24:22.135 --> 00:24:23.218
We can all laugh about it.

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:30.410
So what I didn't want to
just do-- language learning,

00:24:30.410 --> 00:24:32.618
it's great, again, that
that's the biggest community.

00:24:32.618 --> 00:24:35.100
But I wanted to also
expand and make more

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:43.290
about the travel experience
and just general travel,

00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:46.390
foreign cultures, going around
the world and sort of seeing

00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:47.930
the world from foreign eyes.

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:52.605
And so like, for
example, this one

00:24:52.605 --> 00:24:53.980
is about how the
more you travel,

00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:55.950
the less you have to pack.

00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:58.700
And again, taking
it, exaggerating it,

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:01.551
but making it less specific
to my personal experience

00:25:01.551 --> 00:25:03.050
and trying to make
it more generally

00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:05.830
relatable to general audiences.

00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:10.095
I guess it's part of feeling out
what the audience is interested

00:25:10.095 --> 00:25:14.020
in, what they're reacting to,
how you're resonating or not

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:17.010
with different people.

00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:20.660
This one was because when I
was a teenager backpacking

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:22.720
through Europe, for
example, I always

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:24.000
had the big dirty backpack.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.960
I was one of those
guys that had all kinds

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:29.477
of different
compartments and stuff

00:25:29.477 --> 00:25:31.310
and then tons of
everything I could possibly

00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:33.630
need, this huge heavy thing.

00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:36.380
And very proud of it and always
kind of sneering at the jet

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:38.560
setters with their
fancy bags and stuff.

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:41.470
And then last year I
went on a business trip,

00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:43.720
like a proper business trip
where I had to have a suit

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:45.178
and I had to have
like a rolly bag.

00:25:45.178 --> 00:25:46.820
And I was like, oh
my god, I don't have

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:50.130
to carry everything on my back.

00:25:50.130 --> 00:25:52.280
It has wheels and I
can pull it around.

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:55.790
And it's like, I
couldn't believe it.

00:25:55.790 --> 00:26:00.035
So again, just comes from
those sorts of observations.

00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:11.019
This one, for example, has to do
with going to--I went to India

00:26:11.019 --> 00:26:13.602
when I was in high school and I
noticed that it wasn't until I

00:26:13.602 --> 00:26:15.860
came back that the
real culture shock hit.

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:18.854
Because you expect
it to be weird,

00:26:18.854 --> 00:26:20.270
and you expect it
to be different,

00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:23.700
and you expect there to be
all kinds of different--

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:25.674
you expect it to
be uncomfortable

00:26:25.674 --> 00:26:27.340
when you're going to
someplace that's so

00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:30.270
different from your own personal
culture, wherever that is.

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:32.470
And it's not till you come
back to your own country

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:36.440
that you sort of realize
like, whoa, this is suddenly

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:37.390
very different.

00:26:37.390 --> 00:26:39.302
Because that's not
what you're expecting.

00:26:39.302 --> 00:26:41.510
Like, for example, in the
States, I always come back,

00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:44.051
every time I come back to the
States, it's just amazing to me

00:26:44.051 --> 00:26:46.390
how big everything is
and how it's just--

00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:49.350
I still can't comprehend.

00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:52.010
I mean, this isn't even
really an exaggeration.

00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:53.390
People are huge.

00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:55.330
Portions are huge.

00:26:55.330 --> 00:26:59.670
Supermarkets are just-- a big
supermarket here in Europe

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:02.080
could fit in one of the
aisles of these places.

00:27:08.371 --> 00:27:08.870
Right.

00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:13.780
So I think what I learned from
strips like this in particular

00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:16.570
is that internal
observations are oftentimes

00:27:16.570 --> 00:27:18.926
more interesting and
definitely more relatable

00:27:18.926 --> 00:27:20.050
than external observations.

00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:22.440
Like it's great that we can
laugh about the Christmas

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:28.300
crapping log, but I think the
ones that we can all connect on

00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:30.850
are things where you
look back on your own--

00:27:30.850 --> 00:27:36.285
you dig into your own
personal internal experience.

00:27:36.285 --> 00:27:37.660
And so for any
creative endeavor,

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:38.785
that's what you have to do.

00:27:38.785 --> 00:27:42.550
I think it was Hemingway who
said that when he writes,

00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:44.020
he just sits down
at his typewriter

00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:48.180
and then bleeds because
he's just digging up

00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:54.080
all of this emotional
detritus that comes out of him

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:57.456
and just like, I'm
bleeding it on the page.

00:27:57.456 --> 00:27:58.830
This isn't the
work of Hemingway,

00:27:58.830 --> 00:28:03.090
but the idea is that
internal-- looking back inside

00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:04.790
is more interesting
than you observing

00:28:04.790 --> 00:28:06.345
upon the outside world.

00:28:11.670 --> 00:28:14.200
So what makes a good
comic, I've also learned,

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:16.700
is that ironically, people
all the time come up to you

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:19.620
say, oh, here's something
funny that happened to me.

00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:21.690
This would make a great comic.

00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:25.100
And I actually found that
people's personal travel

00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:27.650
experiences, including my
own, as I said earlier,

00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:32.340
they're not that successfully
translatable to a general comic

00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:39.740
because they're so
specific that it could only

00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:41.710
have happened to that
one particular person

00:28:41.710 --> 00:28:43.770
on that particular day
on that particular trip.

00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:46.690
If you were to go on the
same trip as somebody else,

00:28:46.690 --> 00:28:48.690
and walked the exact same
path that they walked,

00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:50.630
you would come back with
totally different stories.

00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:52.338
That's why travel
stories are fun to hear

00:28:52.338 --> 00:28:56.110
because they're so particular
to that person's experience.

00:28:56.110 --> 00:29:01.400
For that reason, I
stay away from making

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:04.611
comics that are about personal,
specific travel stories.

00:29:04.611 --> 00:29:06.360
Man, if I could figure
out a way to do it,

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:07.660
like if I could figure
out a way to make comics

00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:10.260
about these kinds of
stories without making fun

00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:12.320
of the person
telling the story, I

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:16.165
think I would have a much
longer list of to do comics.

00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:22.840
So just go briefly a little
bit to how I make the comics.

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:23.580
My sketchbook.

00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:26.835
And I have pen,
paper, and eraser.

00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:32.880
I first, when I come
up with an idea,

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:36.420
I don't start with
the joke because that

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:41.750
turns into comics that tend
to be much more shallow.

00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:43.460
I start with the idea.

00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:45.640
So I start with the
observation or like the thing

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:48.650
that I've noticed.

00:29:48.650 --> 00:29:49.440
The truth.

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:51.657
I start with the true statement.

00:29:51.657 --> 00:29:53.240
Which I think is a
good starting point

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:55.740
in any kind of
creative endeavor.

00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:57.115
So for instance,
this week I want

00:29:57.115 --> 00:29:58.372
to do one about Switzerland
because we're here

00:29:58.372 --> 00:29:59.272
in Switzerland.

00:29:59.272 --> 00:30:00.980
And there's been one
of the top my list--

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:04.089
I've got this list on my
phone of all the "Itchy Feet"

00:30:04.089 --> 00:30:06.130
ideas that I've been
wanting to do a comic about,

00:30:06.130 --> 00:30:09.360
but I can't think
of how to do it.

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:11.770
Sometimes they'll sit
there and they'll germinate

00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:13.000
on this list for a year.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.260
In this case, it was a year.

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:16.593
I wanted to do one about how
the Swiss trains are always

00:30:16.593 --> 00:30:19.080
on time, but like to
a ridiculous degree.

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:20.570
They're super on time.

00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:23.220
And they leave right on time.

00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:25.860
Exactly when they're
supposed to leave.

00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:29.952
Which again, is sort
of banal observation,

00:30:29.952 --> 00:30:31.660
but it would make a
good comic if I could

00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:33.980
take that and exaggerate it.

00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:36.869
So I start with that idea and I
think of what the joke's going

00:30:36.869 --> 00:30:38.160
to be and then I sketch it out.

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:39.576
This on the left
side of the page,

00:30:39.576 --> 00:30:43.640
is sort of the rough sketch.

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:46.170
So here's the sketch I
came up with the comic.

00:30:46.170 --> 00:30:48.050
You don't have to
worry about-- it's kind

00:30:48.050 --> 00:30:49.883
of-- with the arrows
and stuff figuring out.

00:30:49.883 --> 00:30:53.430
But the point is to get it
all down there on the actual,

00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:57.430
on this sketch version before I
go to the actual drawing of it.

00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:02.510
And the reason is
that you always

00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:07.340
want to begin a project
with the end in mind.

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:10.680
And this is something
that I've definitely

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:11.962
learned through "Itchy Feet."

00:31:11.962 --> 00:31:13.670
It's taught me a lot
about the filmmaking

00:31:13.670 --> 00:31:15.050
that I do, and the
screenwriting, for example

00:31:15.050 --> 00:31:15.550
that I do.

00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:17.410
When you want to start
a creative project

00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:18.630
and you have a
creative idea, you

00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:20.000
want to get right
to the fun part.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.375
You want to get
right to the part

00:31:21.375 --> 00:31:24.107
where like, for filmmaking
for me, is like being on set

00:31:24.107 --> 00:31:26.190
and working with the actors
and placing the camera

00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:29.385
and working with the
special effects people

00:31:29.385 --> 00:31:31.060
and figuring out the
costumes and stuff.

00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:31.894
That's the fun part.

00:31:31.894 --> 00:31:34.268
But you can't get to that part
until you have the script.

00:31:34.268 --> 00:31:35.990
And not just have it,
but that it's done

00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:37.640
and that it's a complete story.

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:40.330
You can't just be-- I mean
some directors totally

00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:43.350
do improvise on set-- but I'm
not that kind of creative.

00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:48.310
I need to have it all worked
out beforehand so that you

00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:52.330
don't get messy when you're
in the actual part that's fun.

00:31:52.330 --> 00:31:53.830
Then you have this
backbone that you

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:56.150
can rely on to be good at
the end of the process.

00:31:56.150 --> 00:31:57.590
And so that needs to be there.

00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:59.810
And this sketch, this
like, rough sketch

00:31:59.810 --> 00:32:02.680
has to be there before
I start drawing.

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:05.360
The fun part is the
drawing but it has to wait.

00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:15.630
Then I do the pencil
sketch and I ink it.

00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:17.750
And I ink all the pieces
separately on the page

00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:18.625
and then I scan that.

00:32:18.625 --> 00:32:21.237
I take a photo of it and put
it into Photoshop and kind

00:32:21.237 --> 00:32:22.362
of align all the materials.

00:32:22.362 --> 00:32:24.290
I try to, as much as
possible, stay away

00:32:24.290 --> 00:32:27.200
from the computer because all
of our lives are on the computer

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:27.810
these days.

00:32:27.810 --> 00:32:29.319
Our work is on the computer.

00:32:29.319 --> 00:32:30.610
Our movies are on the computer.

00:32:30.610 --> 00:32:32.693
The things that we do for
fun are on the computer.

00:32:32.693 --> 00:32:35.230
Our games, chatting with
friends, Skyping, all of it

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:36.100
is on the computer.

00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:38.510
And so I wanted to keep
as much of this process

00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:41.070
where I could just
take like half an hour

00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:44.090
and put the computer aside and
do something with my hands,

00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:46.034
something physical.

00:32:46.034 --> 00:32:47.700
Again, I do it in
Photoshop and the end,

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:49.460
because it's better and easier.

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:50.960
But I don't want
to use the tablets.

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:55.690
I refuse to use those
drawing tablets for now.

00:32:55.690 --> 00:32:58.610
And then this,
the final version.

00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:05.850
Right.

00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:09.130
So this will come out on
Sunday, which again, ha, ha,

00:33:09.130 --> 00:33:11.140
they're still on time,
these Swiss trains

00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:13.145
that even a delay is
only seven seconds.

00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:21.310
So the style of "Itchy Feet"
comes mostly from, as I said,

00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:23.620
I wasn't really ever
a comics person.

00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:26.400
I did read the newspaper
comics, so a lot of it's

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:28.775
influenced by comics like
"Calvin Hobbes," "The Far

00:33:28.775 --> 00:33:31.575
Side," and the other ones.

00:33:31.575 --> 00:33:33.200
I would read them
every single morning.

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:34.158
And the funny thing is.

00:33:34.158 --> 00:33:37.344
In the States anyway, they have
what's called The Funny Pages.

00:33:37.344 --> 00:33:38.760
And the Funny Pages
is just a page

00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:42.610
in the newspaper that's top
to bottom newspaper comics.

00:33:42.610 --> 00:33:45.260
And none of them are
funny, for the most part,

00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:47.000
but they're called
The Funny Pages.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.729
And I remember my
brothers asking me,

00:33:48.729 --> 00:33:50.270
because I would read
them religiously

00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:51.930
every single morning,
why do you read this?

00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:52.763
You're not laughing.

00:33:52.763 --> 00:33:54.010
You're not even smiling.

00:33:54.010 --> 00:33:56.030
And I think it was because
I liked the drawings.

00:33:56.030 --> 00:33:59.990
I learned a lot about the
cartoony style of the drawings

00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:01.680
of the newspapers.

00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:04.770
And it was only recently that I
looked at the "Itchy Feet" guy

00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:08.000
and I kind of saw
where the two of them

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.559
met, where it came from.

00:34:09.559 --> 00:34:11.559
So it's sort of this, if
you take Homer Simpson,

00:34:11.559 --> 00:34:13.270
and if you've seen
Don Hertzfeldt, whose

00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:15.440
fantastic rejected
cartoons, these sort

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:18.800
of bizarre, abstract,
hilarious cartoons.

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:22.380
You smash them together and
get the "Itchy Feet" guy.

00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:24.270
So the lesson from that
is stealing is good.

00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:28.239
In a creative sense.

00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:39.290
Steve Jobs that said that--
have you every seen these videos

00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:41.320
"Everything is a Remix?"

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:44.570
It's this guy that basically
thinks-- these video essays

00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:45.570
about exactly this fact.

00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:47.839
That everything
creative in our culture

00:34:47.839 --> 00:34:49.130
is remixed from something else.

00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:52.560
There's no such thing
as an original anything.

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:56.440
And in that video,
he has this example

00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:58.870
of this interview with Steve
Jobs, this video interview

00:34:58.870 --> 00:35:00.328
where he says, we
steal shamelessly

00:35:00.328 --> 00:35:01.436
from other great ideas.

00:35:01.436 --> 00:35:02.810
We steal great
ideas all the time

00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:06.260
because they're great ideas and
they belong to us, to everyone.

00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:10.090
And then directly after that, it
was like when Android came out

00:35:10.090 --> 00:35:11.550
and he was saying
something about,

00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:13.090
I will go thermonuclear
war on this.

00:35:13.090 --> 00:35:14.410
They've stolen our ideas.

00:35:14.410 --> 00:35:17.200
They've taken our best objects.

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:18.740
People get protective.

00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:23.260
But creatively, I do agree that
it's not just it's OK to steal

00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:24.760
and that there is
no original ideas,

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:26.550
it's that you had no choice.

00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:27.860
You don't create in a vacuum.

00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:28.720
You create from
your inspirations

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:31.219
and you create from the things
that subconsciously burrow

00:35:31.219 --> 00:35:32.760
into your brain like
little parasites

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:38.870
and then come out into
bean-shaped stick figure

00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:40.190
characters with bulging eyes.

00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:48.450
So that's "Itchy Feet" now.

00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:50.030
What "Itchy Feet"
could be for me--

00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:54.020
I mean, again, as long as
I keep telling the truth,

00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:56.900
I feel like I'll have
something that everyone will be

00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:59.900
able to relate to in some way.

00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:03.980
Now that I've married
this famous Italian girl,

00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:06.160
we've started sort of
an international family.

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:08.696
And so it will be,
eventually-- I'm

00:36:08.696 --> 00:36:10.070
working more strips
into how it's

00:36:10.070 --> 00:36:13.040
like to be married to somebody
that's from a different culture

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:14.850
and be part of family
that's a completely

00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:18.320
foreign culture to yours.

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:21.030
And I assume at some
point down the line

00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:24.650
there will be lots of
little "Itchy Feet" people

00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:26.671
and it'll be about--
the comic might change

00:36:26.671 --> 00:36:28.670
to being what it's like
to travel with a family.

00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:32.620
And man, who can't relate to
screaming kids on the plane?

00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:37.910
Or the problems with the
way different cultures

00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:41.916
treat kids as they
travel around.

00:36:41.916 --> 00:36:43.290
And then I assume,
at some point,

00:36:43.290 --> 00:36:46.700
it will be about
traveling as an old person

00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:50.090
when robots carry our luggage.

00:36:50.090 --> 00:36:53.410
And I suppose
they'll probably put

00:36:53.410 --> 00:36:57.180
"Itchy Feet" on my tombstone,
despite the fact that again,

00:36:57.180 --> 00:36:57.951
this is a hobby.

00:36:57.951 --> 00:36:59.450
This isn't what I
do professionally.

00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:00.825
It's just something
I do for fun.

00:37:00.825 --> 00:37:04.530
But when you do something
and it resonates

00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:09.060
with even one or two other
people, you got to keep going.

00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:10.030
You're serving someone.

00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:11.736
Suddenly you're serving them.

00:37:11.736 --> 00:37:15.130
You're doing it
for someone else.

00:37:15.130 --> 00:37:19.690
And so I guess that would be if
I had any one particular take

00:37:19.690 --> 00:37:25.280
away that it would be that find
something that's creative--

00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:27.920
and I don't have to tell you
guys this, you work at Google--

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:31.560
but to do outside
of your work life

00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:33.650
and tell the truth with it.

00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:34.979
Whatever it is, tell the truth.

00:37:34.979 --> 00:37:37.020
And if you don't know what
that means, that's OK.

00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:39.050
I didn't either and I'm
not sure I still do.

00:37:39.050 --> 00:37:41.230
But keep doing it
until you find out

00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:43.960
what that is, what it means
to tell the truth in anything

00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:46.690
that's creative work.

00:37:46.690 --> 00:37:49.105
As for myself, I
have another project

00:37:49.105 --> 00:37:54.620
that I just started which
is a series of kids' fantasy

00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:55.664
adventure books.

00:37:55.664 --> 00:37:57.080
And it's where
I've managed to mix

00:37:57.080 --> 00:38:01.100
my love of like I was talking
about, fantastic adventure

00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:06.490
with the truth of what it's
like to have that joy of getting

00:38:06.490 --> 00:38:09.030
on a boat or a plane and
traveling to some new place

00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:11.100
and having some new adventure.

00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:14.450
And so that's the
feeling that I want

00:38:14.450 --> 00:38:16.650
to instill into 12-year-olds
or at least bring up

00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:18.490
from my internal 12-year-old.

00:38:23.081 --> 00:38:23.580
That's it.

00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:26.070
So yeah, I'm on Patreon,
if you want to support

00:38:26.070 --> 00:38:29.970
the hilarious comic arts.

00:38:29.970 --> 00:38:34.130
And I believe that's
all I have to say.

00:38:34.130 --> 00:38:35.130
Thank you so much.

00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:46.860
If you have any questions,
we'll do a little Q and A. Yeah?

00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:49.140
AUDIENCE: Is there a
[INAUDIBLE] how often does it

00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:52.067
happen like you finish
one cartoon and then you

00:38:52.067 --> 00:38:54.549
have to say, OK, I totally
have to reject this?

00:38:54.549 --> 00:38:55.090
Or something.

00:38:55.090 --> 00:38:58.320
So every cartoon you publish,
there are like three others

00:38:58.320 --> 00:38:59.580
that you reject?

00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:00.663
MALACHI REMPEN: Oh, I see.

00:39:00.663 --> 00:39:05.306
Like, as far as ones
that get past my wife?

00:39:05.306 --> 00:39:08.580
It depends-- sorry?

00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:11.530
The question was
what do I-- how often

00:39:11.530 --> 00:39:13.840
do I reject strips, right.

00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:16.990
What's the success to failure
rate of the-- most of them

00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:17.500
go through.

00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:19.230
I would say 90%
of them go through

00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:20.622
because I try and figure it out.

00:39:20.622 --> 00:39:22.330
First of all, I've
gotten better recently

00:39:22.330 --> 00:39:24.340
at figuring out
what's going to work

00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:26.960
and what's not going to work.

00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:28.860
At the beginning
though, early on, I

00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:32.437
did a lot of going back and
like, drawing a new frame

00:39:32.437 --> 00:39:34.770
and going back and adding it
and maybe changing the joke

00:39:34.770 --> 00:39:37.260
and trying to figure out a
way because she might say,

00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:39.771
like I get what you're trying
to say, but it's not funny.

00:39:39.771 --> 00:39:40.270
Or whatever.

00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:43.050
And then I would try
and refigure the joke.

00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:47.510
But I'd say it doesn't happen
very often because I've

00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:49.920
gotten more disciplined
about finishing it

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:54.890
at the sketch level, where
the core of it's done.

00:39:54.890 --> 00:39:59.704
And then the rest is just
basically frosting on the cake.

00:39:59.704 --> 00:40:01.060
AUDIENCE: Sorry, one more.

00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:02.420
So how many do you make?

00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:04.600
So what's your typical,
like one per month?

00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:06.690
MALACHI REMPEN: Oh, I do
them weekly, every week.

00:40:06.690 --> 00:40:07.560
Every Sunday.

00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:14.390
And recently, it's been a lot
of very, very last minute,

00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:15.827
like a Saturday night.

00:40:15.827 --> 00:40:18.160
But I've done it for three
years now, every single week.

00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:20.750
Even when I go on a trip,
I'll write them in advance.

00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:22.710
Like right now, I've got
some travels coming up

00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:25.200
so I've written like the
next four or five in advance

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:26.450
and I've scheduled them to go.

00:40:26.450 --> 00:40:27.525
But that rarely happens.

00:40:27.525 --> 00:40:29.650
Usually, it's like me
scrambling at the last minute

00:40:29.650 --> 00:40:31.770
to think of something funny.

00:40:31.770 --> 00:40:33.129
Yes, Jeff.

00:40:33.129 --> 00:40:35.737
AUDIENCE: Obviously the ideas
sit in your head for a while.

00:40:35.737 --> 00:40:38.508
You said you've had
some for a year.

00:40:38.508 --> 00:40:41.574
How long does it
take you [INAUDIBLE]?

00:40:41.574 --> 00:40:43.240
MALACHI REMPEN: How
long does it take me

00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:48.060
once I have the idea to
actually sit down and draw it?

00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:50.885
Oh, man, that depends on how
close I am to the deadline.

00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:57.040
Sometimes I'll sit-- I've
found, and it's not just

00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:59.510
with "Itchy Feet," it's
with writing as well,

00:40:59.510 --> 00:41:02.430
that a big part of
the creative process

00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:04.967
is staring blankly into
space or staring at a wall

00:41:04.967 --> 00:41:06.050
and accomplishing nothing.

00:41:06.050 --> 00:41:08.008
Or you think you're not
accomplishing anything.

00:41:08.008 --> 00:41:10.680
In reality, what you're doing
is you're working on it,

00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:12.977
you're stewing it,
you're cooking it.

00:41:12.977 --> 00:41:14.560
But it feels like a
lot of wasted time

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:17.970
that you're sitting
starting at a wall.

00:41:17.970 --> 00:41:22.800
And I used to hate that part
of it until I read about Pixar.

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:26.180
That they actually,
they know that this

00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:27.710
is how the creative
process works

00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:30.220
and they schedule that
time into their development

00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:34.060
of their stories so that
when they hit the wall,

00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:36.265
even if it's a big group
of genius storytellers,

00:41:36.265 --> 00:41:38.640
they hit the wall, they can't
figure out what to do next,

00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:39.830
and they go like,
all right, well,

00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:41.710
let's go do something
else for a couple days.

00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:43.500
And it's planned.

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:45.477
They plan this block.

00:41:45.477 --> 00:41:47.060
This section where
you're just sitting

00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:49.018
there banging your head
against an idea and you

00:41:49.018 --> 00:41:51.100
can't think of something.

00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:55.530
So to answer your question,
usually like a couple hours.

00:41:55.530 --> 00:41:58.280
Usually, I sit there and
I'll have blocked this time

00:41:58.280 --> 00:41:59.270
aside to do it.

00:41:59.270 --> 00:42:01.930
So I'll sit there and
go, OK, this is the idea.

00:42:01.930 --> 00:42:02.780
That doesn't work.

00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:03.350
That doesn't work.

00:42:03.350 --> 00:42:04.183
Oh, this would work.

00:42:04.183 --> 00:42:05.370
Nah, that doesn't work.

00:42:05.370 --> 00:42:07.060
And then a couple
hours later, like

00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:10.730
once it clicks, and I, like I
said, I get the sketch down,

00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:14.217
then it's just an hour or so of
like, drawing it, scanning it,

00:42:14.217 --> 00:42:15.050
getting it up there.

00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:16.890
You can see, these aren't the
most complicated drawings.

00:42:16.890 --> 00:42:18.550
I deliberately
wanted to simplify

00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:21.310
it to make it something
that I could reasonably

00:42:21.310 --> 00:42:24.180
do in my free time.

00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:25.360
Any other questions?

00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:25.984
Yeah.

00:42:25.984 --> 00:42:28.025
AUDIENCE: What is your
day job like? [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:30.655 --> 00:42:31.530
MALACHI REMPEN: Yeah.

00:42:31.530 --> 00:42:36.280
My day job is a, like I
said, freelance filmmaker.

00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:37.670
So I do commercials.

00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:38.750
I do Internet films.

00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:39.640
I do image films.

00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:40.899
I do promotional films.

00:42:40.899 --> 00:42:41.940
I do short documentaries.

00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:44.569
I do sort of whatever
comes down the pipeline.

00:42:44.569 --> 00:42:46.235
But because I do that,
I'm self-employed

00:42:46.235 --> 00:42:51.679
and it's freelance, that's
not really a day job.

00:42:51.679 --> 00:42:53.970
Hey, it would be great like
if I could figure out a way

00:42:53.970 --> 00:42:56.580
to make "Itchy
Feet" pay my rent,

00:42:56.580 --> 00:43:00.770
then I could not have to
worry about trying to put food

00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:04.440
on the table and actually
worry more about doing quality

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:06.120
comics, which would be great.

00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:07.670
I haven't figured it out yet.

00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:11.514
Although, to be
honest, I haven't tried

00:43:11.514 --> 00:43:12.680
too hard to make my day job.

00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:14.390
I don't know, I
feel like I almost

00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:17.700
don't want it to be because if
it became the thing I got paid

00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:21.340
to do and the thing that I
was making a living from,

00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:22.790
I'm worried it
would become work.

00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:24.875
And if it became work
and it was somehow

00:43:24.875 --> 00:43:26.500
put a different kind
of pressure on it,

00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:28.458
and I'm worried that that
would actually affect

00:43:28.458 --> 00:43:31.230
the quality of the comic.

00:43:31.230 --> 00:43:32.926
But I don't know.

00:43:32.926 --> 00:43:34.300
I've never done
anything creative

00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:36.747
in that way,
professionally before.

00:43:36.747 --> 00:43:37.330
There's a ton.

00:43:37.330 --> 00:43:38.498
I'm sure it'll be fine.

00:43:38.498 --> 00:43:41.490
AUDIENCE: Do you know how
many readers you have?

00:43:41.490 --> 00:43:44.059
MALACHI REMPEN: Readers?

00:43:44.059 --> 00:43:45.450
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:45.450 --> 00:43:46.700
MALACHI REMPEN: Yeah, sort of.

00:43:49.110 --> 00:43:50.790
I've gotten to the
point, I first-- I've

00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:54.290
crossed a milestone
I had for myself,

00:43:54.290 --> 00:43:58.610
which was I wanted to meet
somebody and give them

00:43:58.610 --> 00:44:03.942
my "Itchy Feet" business
card and then they would say,

00:44:03.942 --> 00:44:05.900
oh, I've heard of you or
I have seen your work.

00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:09.770
And that happened recently
and I was so excited.

00:44:09.770 --> 00:44:16.780
Because it's like-- it makes
the world a smaller place.

00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:18.640
So I don't actually
know the exact number.

00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:21.150
I know I get a couple--
it varies depending

00:44:21.150 --> 00:44:23.840
on whether the comic's any
good and whether people

00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:26.900
respond to it or not.

00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:30.720
Like, as far as
traffic goes, I get

00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:34.400
between 10,000 and 20,000
unique visitors a month,

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:36.660
which for a lot of
comics is nothing.

00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:38.010
That's pennies.

00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:41.030
And for a lot of web
comics, that's a ton.

00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:45.189
That's like incredible--
that's world fame.

00:44:45.189 --> 00:44:45.730
I don't know.

00:44:45.730 --> 00:44:47.410
I have no personal
metric against which

00:44:47.410 --> 00:44:51.050
to say whether I have a
lot or a little viewers.

00:44:51.050 --> 00:44:51.870
Fact is, I'm here.

00:44:51.870 --> 00:44:53.786
I'm talking to you guys,
that's enough for me.

00:44:53.786 --> 00:44:55.270
That's pretty cool.

00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:56.026
Yeah.

00:44:56.026 --> 00:44:58.276
AUDIENCE: Do you do anything
to increase your readers,

00:44:58.276 --> 00:45:01.100
like social media,
Facebook, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:05.680
MALACHI REMPEN: Do
I do anything to--

00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:06.820
AUDIENCE: Make it popular.

00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:09.170
MALACHI REMPEN: To publicize
it on social networks.

00:45:09.170 --> 00:45:11.840
I'm just repeating
it for the video.

00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:15.530
Do I do any self promotion
on social media and stuff.

00:45:15.530 --> 00:45:16.140
Yeah, I do.

00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:20.070
I pretty much just Reddit,
is the only one that I use.

00:45:20.070 --> 00:45:22.320
The language learning community
there is really great.

00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:24.710
And they support the comics.

00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:26.910
They do it in a big way.

00:45:26.910 --> 00:45:28.640
And on Facebook, it
kind of has a mind

00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:31.560
of its own, the promotion thing.

00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:33.410
So I publish it on Twitter.

00:45:33.410 --> 00:45:34.910
That goes automatically
to Facebook.

00:45:34.910 --> 00:45:37.339
It's all designed for me to
do as little work as possible.

00:45:37.339 --> 00:45:39.380
But like, it's all automated
and then it goes out

00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:41.930
and then I respond
to people, obviously,

00:45:41.930 --> 00:45:44.849
when they talk to me.

00:45:44.849 --> 00:45:45.390
I don't know.

00:45:45.390 --> 00:45:47.306
I have a lot to learn
in this field, for sure.

00:45:47.306 --> 00:45:49.950
And I think every day I'm
learning a little bit more

00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:50.950
about it.

00:45:50.950 --> 00:45:53.210
I think I need to up
the game a little bit.

00:45:53.210 --> 00:45:54.930
For sure.

00:45:54.930 --> 00:45:55.574
Yeah.

00:45:55.574 --> 00:45:59.340
AUDIENCE: So I found people
who said, within my work area,

00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:02.257
I can get about six of the nine
tongue twisters from last week.

00:46:02.257 --> 00:46:03.048
MALACHI REMPEN: OK.

00:46:03.048 --> 00:46:04.631
AUDIENCE: I was
wondering if you could

00:46:04.631 --> 00:46:07.800
go through the ones in
Esperanto and Korean.

00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:11.940
MALACHI REMPEN: Oh, now
you've put me on the spot.

00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:13.229
I don't have it here.

00:46:13.229 --> 00:46:14.020
AUDIENCE: Oh, here.

00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:14.988
I've got it.

00:46:18.924 --> 00:46:20.590
MALACHI REMPEN: Does
this have internet?

00:46:20.590 --> 00:46:21.880
Could I just bring that up?

00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:23.338
Like, if I could
bring up the site,

00:46:23.338 --> 00:46:26.530
then I could just go to it.

00:46:26.530 --> 00:46:32.433
And then is there like a-- nice.

00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:40.940
Tongue twisters from
around the world.

00:46:45.169 --> 00:46:46.460
So what do you mean you've got?

00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:47.786
Like what do you mean got?

00:46:47.786 --> 00:46:49.883
AUDIENCE: I could find
people who could read them

00:46:49.883 --> 00:46:51.980
and sort of talk about
what they were about.

00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:54.490
MALACHI REMPEN: What the
drawing behind it was.

00:46:54.490 --> 00:46:55.340
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:56.970
What the words were.

00:46:56.970 --> 00:46:58.540
MALACHI REMPEN:
So the French one,

00:46:58.540 --> 00:47:04.340
are the socks of
the arch Duchess

00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:08.900
dry or very dry or is it
not dry. [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:09.740
AUDIENCE: Very dry.

00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:10.781
MALACHI REMPEN: Very dry.

00:47:10.781 --> 00:47:12.370
So are they dry or very dry.

00:47:12.370 --> 00:47:13.920
The second one is Italian.

00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:19.135
I can actually say this
one. [SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:47:19.135 --> 00:47:19.930
Was that good?

00:47:19.930 --> 00:47:21.954
IRIS: Si.

00:47:21.954 --> 00:47:24.120
MALACHI REMPEN: On top of
the bench, the goat lives.

00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:27.037
Under the bench, the goat dies.

00:47:27.037 --> 00:47:28.120
The next one's in Russian.

00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:28.620
I can't.

00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:30.120
Can anyone do it here?

00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:30.960
Russian.

00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:32.420
OK go.

00:47:32.420 --> 00:47:37.020
AUDIENCE: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:41.720
MALACHI REMPEN: So Carl
steals Carla's coral

00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:45.840
and Carla steals
Carl's clarinet,

00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:50.537
which I think in English is a
perfectly good tongue twister.

00:47:50.537 --> 00:47:51.620
The next one's Portuguese.

00:47:51.620 --> 00:47:54.120
Anyone can do Portuguese here?

00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:54.912
Go ahead.

00:47:54.912 --> 00:47:55.828
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:03.254 --> 00:48:04.920
MALACHI REMPEN: In
Brazilian Portuguese.

00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:06.660
OK.

00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:08.799
AUDIENCE: [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]

00:48:08.799 --> 00:48:09.590
MALACHI REMPEN: OK.

00:48:09.590 --> 00:48:12.637
And it could be that it's like
a Portugal Portuguese one.

00:48:12.637 --> 00:48:14.470
And that just means,
from what I understand,

00:48:14.470 --> 00:48:19.080
a rat gnaws on the cork of
the run of the King of Russia.

00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:21.890
Right.

00:48:21.890 --> 00:48:23.370
Japanese one, anyone?

00:48:23.370 --> 00:48:25.026
Japanese?

00:48:25.026 --> 00:48:28.170
AUDIENCE: Go for it.

00:48:28.170 --> 00:48:38.100
AUDIENCE: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:40.430
MALACHI REMPEN: And that
means, in the garden

00:48:40.430 --> 00:48:43.730
of Mr. Neewa-- which I couldn't
fit into the drawing-- two

00:48:43.730 --> 00:48:47.080
chickens suddenly
eat a crocodile.

00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:49.280
That was really hard to
figure out how to draw that.

00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:49.980
I'll say that.

00:48:49.980 --> 00:48:50.727
I knew I had to.

00:48:50.727 --> 00:48:51.810
I knew I had to draw that.

00:48:51.810 --> 00:48:53.559
But like, two chickens
eating a crocodile.

00:48:53.559 --> 00:48:56.770
Like how do two chickens
eat one crocodile?

00:48:59.794 --> 00:49:00.710
The next one's Hebrew.

00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:01.210
Anyone?

00:49:01.210 --> 00:49:03.340
Anyone do Hebrew?

00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:03.940
Oh, no.

00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:04.717
I can't either.

00:49:04.717 --> 00:49:06.050
And it sounds really funny, too.

00:49:06.050 --> 00:49:07.590
It's like wo-do-wo-do-wo-do.

00:49:07.590 --> 00:49:11.079
But it means, you were
supposed to clean the locker,

00:49:11.079 --> 00:49:12.120
did you clean the locker?

00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:13.536
I'm not going to
clean the locker?

00:49:13.536 --> 00:49:15.520
You clean the locker.

00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:17.515
That's what that one is.

00:49:17.515 --> 00:49:18.590
Korean?

00:49:18.590 --> 00:49:19.723
Anyone Hangul?

00:49:19.723 --> 00:49:20.223
No.

00:49:20.223 --> 00:49:22.115
AUDIENCE: I can
make [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:24.327 --> 00:49:26.118
MALACHI REMPEN: Better
than mine, I'm sure.

00:49:26.118 --> 00:49:28.558
AUDIENCE: It goes something
like this. [SPEAKING KOREAN].

00:49:43.370 --> 00:49:44.870
MALACHI REMPEN: You
can even see it.

00:49:44.870 --> 00:49:47.840
Like, well done.

00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:49.840
Not bad, right, for
someone learning.

00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:50.360
Fantastic.

00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:52.735
So you can even see like I
love this like little circles.

00:49:52.735 --> 00:49:56.020
Like, wan gan gan gan gan gan.

00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:59.530
It even looks like-- a
tongue twister for your eyes.

00:49:59.530 --> 00:50:03.550
And that means, Kang
is the president

00:50:03.550 --> 00:50:04.740
of the soy sauce factory.

00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:09.670
And Kong is the president
of the bean paste factory.

00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:11.870
I mean, they're all
nonsense, right?

00:50:11.870 --> 00:50:12.990
The next one's Turkish.

00:50:12.990 --> 00:50:15.070
Can anyone do Turkish?

00:50:15.070 --> 00:50:16.660
Turkish?

00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:17.864
I'll do it.

00:50:17.864 --> 00:50:18.780
I don't speak Turkish.

00:50:18.780 --> 00:50:26.720
[SPEAKING TURKISH] And it
means, the branch bends

00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:28.490
and the eagle takes off.

00:50:28.490 --> 00:50:31.870
The eagle takes off
and the branch bends.

00:50:31.870 --> 00:50:32.910
The last one, Esperanto.

00:50:32.910 --> 00:50:34.190
Come on, someone, Esperanto.

00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:36.170
Nobody here can do Esperanto?

00:50:36.170 --> 00:50:37.670
This one I don't
know how to say it.

00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:43.970
I guess [SPEAKING ESPERANTO]
Is my guess.

00:50:43.970 --> 00:50:47.600
And it means-- oh,
what's this knife called?

00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:49.652
Does anyone know this
particular kind of knife?

00:50:49.652 --> 00:50:50.507
AUDIENCE: Machete.

00:50:50.507 --> 00:50:52.340
MALACHI REMPEN: It's
like, that's the sword.

00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:54.480
But there's like a knife,
like a kind of machete.

00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:55.021
It's typical.

00:50:55.021 --> 00:50:56.140
It's like a bow knife.

00:50:56.140 --> 00:50:57.100
Not a now knife.

00:50:57.100 --> 00:50:57.667
Bull knife.

00:50:57.667 --> 00:50:58.500
Something like that.

00:50:58.500 --> 00:51:02.700
So anyway, it's I hope
this large knife will

00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:06.160
help you to scoop out the
brains of that Serbian deer.

00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:15.485
Thanks, Esperanto.

00:51:19.970 --> 00:51:23.222
Any other questions?

00:51:23.222 --> 00:51:24.154
Yeah.

00:51:24.154 --> 00:51:26.280
AUDIENCE: Can you tell
us where we can buy

00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:28.016
Liechtensteinian army knife?

00:51:28.016 --> 00:51:31.350
MALACHI REMPEN: A
Liechtensteinian army knife.

00:51:31.350 --> 00:51:32.700
Did you go to Liechtenstein?

00:51:32.700 --> 00:51:34.205
AUDIENCE: Yeah. [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:34.205 --> 00:51:36.830
MALACHI REMPEN: They didn't even
call them the Liechtensteinian

00:51:36.830 --> 00:51:37.675
army knives?

00:51:40.250 --> 00:51:42.585
Grandma didn't get
the Lichtenstein joke.

00:51:46.540 --> 00:51:48.800
I have-- I guess I'm
not going to scroll

00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:49.800
through the whole thing.

00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:53.740
But I went to Liechtenstein
and it was basically exactly

00:51:53.740 --> 00:51:56.090
like Switzerland,
except even smaller.

00:51:56.090 --> 00:51:58.940
And they had the
same chocolates,

00:51:58.940 --> 00:52:01.409
and the same cheeses,
and the same everything,

00:52:01.409 --> 00:52:02.950
except they put
"Lichtenstein" on it.

00:52:02.950 --> 00:52:03.320
But it's true.

00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:05.330
They didn't actually do
that on the army knives.

00:52:05.330 --> 00:52:06.040
You got me.

00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:07.465
Are you happy?

00:52:11.210 --> 00:52:11.710
Yeah.

00:52:11.710 --> 00:52:13.085
AUDIENCE: Here's
a good question.

00:52:13.085 --> 00:52:15.168
Back to the "Merry
Mariner" book, [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:20.340
MALACHI REMPEN: I'll show you.

00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:22.862
How I get to the URL bar again?

00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:34.030
So it's going to be
a series of books

00:52:34.030 --> 00:52:36.630
that I'm going to do for print.

00:52:36.630 --> 00:52:39.720
But for the moment,
they are short stories

00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:44.150
that are set in that same
world that are-- they're

00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:45.240
for free online right now.

00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:46.490
I'm working on other versions.

00:52:46.490 --> 00:52:47.440
Right now it's a PDF.

00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:51.480
But I'm working on getting
them for iPad and Kindle

00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:52.300
and so forth.

00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:54.702
And there's going to be
six short stories with each

00:52:54.702 --> 00:52:55.660
of the main characters.

00:52:55.660 --> 00:52:58.610
It's about this family,
basically, of adventurers.

00:52:58.610 --> 00:53:00.144
And each of these
short stories is

00:53:00.144 --> 00:53:02.060
going to set from one
of their points of view.

00:53:02.060 --> 00:53:03.976
And then there's going
to be a series of books

00:53:03.976 --> 00:53:05.800
that come out after that.

00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:09.345
But they're all
charmingly illustrated.

00:53:13.570 --> 00:53:17.030
And it's like my childlike love
of old-- those books where you

00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:18.454
open up and it's full of stuff.

00:53:18.454 --> 00:53:19.370
It's full of diagrams.

00:53:19.370 --> 00:53:21.150
And they've got
cutaways of things.

00:53:21.150 --> 00:53:23.700
And they've got machines.

00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:25.080
And they've got how things work.

00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:27.038
And they've got recipes
and all kinds of stuff.

00:53:27.038 --> 00:53:32.070
So in addition to being a
fully illustrated book series.

00:53:32.070 --> 00:53:34.510
So right now they're
free online on the site.

00:53:37.270 --> 00:53:38.230
Any other questions?

00:53:41.992 --> 00:53:42.950
Thank you guys so much.

00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:44.980
You were so, so great.
