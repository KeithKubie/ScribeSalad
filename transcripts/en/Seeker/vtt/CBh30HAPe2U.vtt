00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.860
Would you rather sit around
watching D News videos all day

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:03.860
instead of exercising?

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.580
Well, if so, scientific
research suggests

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:08.625
that your genes
might be to blame.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.300
Hi, I'm Cristen Conger, of Stuff
Mom Never Told You, for D News.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.840
And in 2013, research on genes--
or the cellular instruction

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.910
manuals we inherit
from our parents--

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.590
offered some
fascinating insights

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.930
into how those nifty DNA
packages may influence

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.240
our daily habits and behaviors.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.780
For starters, researchers out
of the University of Missouri

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.850
pinpointed a set
of 36 genes that

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.920
might determine how much or
little we love to exercise.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.350
After noticing how some
lab rats voluntarily

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.390
jogged on their
wheels while others

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.800
took it easy inside their
cages, the researchers

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.520
bred 10 generations of the
active and not-so-active rats,

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.540
and found that the physical
activity gap persisted

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.450
between those groups of great,
great, great, and so forth rat

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:00.294
grandchildren.

00:01:00.294 --> 00:01:01.710
And the most
noticeable difference

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.200
between those two groups--
those 36 laziness genes.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.710
Now in the future,
though, we might

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.680
have a work-around those
so-called laziness genes

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.140
thanks to PLIN2, better
known as the obesity gene.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.310
A promising study published
in early 2013 detailed

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.450
how turning off that PLIN2
genetic expression halted

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.620
weight gain, and increased
activity levels in rats,

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.800
even when they were being
that high fat diets.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.400
Next up, scientists
plan to figure out

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.280
the physiological mechanisms
behind that obesity gene,

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.730
and how it might work in humans.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.030
Now recent digging into our DNA
has revealed not only insights

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.120
into our physical health, but
also our emotional health.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.000
For the first time, in 2013,
researchers from UC Berkeley

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.090
and Northwestern University
identified a gene variant,

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.690
or allele, that
appeared to mediate

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.490
husbands' and wives' emotional
sensitivity to relationship ups

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:55.190
and downs.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.760
Specifically, the people who
inherited two short versions

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.100
of this marital
bliss gene tended

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.010
to report more relationship
highs and lows, whereas those

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.050
with long versions of the
genes were more even keeled

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.600
over the long term.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.722
Now undoubtedly, some
couples with kids

00:02:11.722 --> 00:02:13.180
may experience more
emotional highs

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.490
than lows due to a newly
discovered gene that

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.280
triggers early, or
precocious, puberty.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.050
According to a 2013 study
published in the New England

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.490
Journal of Medicine, a
genetic mutation passed along

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.065
by fathers may cause
reproductive hormones

00:02:26.065 --> 00:02:29.200
to activate in kids younger
than nine years old, which

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.250
can lead to health
complications later in life, not

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.300
to mention a prolonged period
of hormone-related adolescent

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.650
angst.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.700
And finally, as
a rare south paw,

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.260
I was interested to learn about
a possible genetic explanation

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.560
for handedness.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.050
It turns out that right
handedness, at least,

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.840
may root back to embryonic
genes that organize our organs,

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.660
and help our bodies
develop symmetrically.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.490
But unfortunately, we'll
have to wait until 2014

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.130
or later to get to the
bottom of why some of us

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.210
go left instead of right.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.975
But enough about
me, what about you?

00:03:01.975 --> 00:03:03.960
What kinds of DNA
discoveries are you

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.409
hoping to see in the future?
