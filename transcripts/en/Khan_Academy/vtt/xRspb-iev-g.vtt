00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.210
Welcome to the presentation
on the indefinite integral

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:04.430
or the antiderivative.

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:06.750
So let's begin with a
bit of a review of the

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:07.270
actual derivative.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.700
So if I were to take
the derivative d/dx.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.450
It's just the
derivative operator.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.700
If I were to take the
derivative of the expression

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.140
x squared-- this is an easy
one if you remember the

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.860
derivative presentation.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.400
Well, this is pretty
straightforward.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.640
You just take the exponent.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.100
That becomes the new
coefficient, right.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.040
You actually multiply it times
the old coefficient, but in

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.310
this case the old coefficient
is 1, so 2 times 1 is 2.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.130
And you take the variable 2x.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.170
And then the new exponent
will be one less than

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.460
the old exponent.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.930
So it'll be 2x to
the 1, or just 2x.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:42.580
So that was easy.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.000
If I had y equals x squared we
now know that the slope at any

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.240
point on that curve,
it would be 2x.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.040
So what if we wanted
to go the other way?

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.720
Let's say if we wanted to start
with 2x, and I wanted to say

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:07.330
2x is the derivative of what.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.420
Well, we know the answer
this question, right?

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.755
Because we just took the
derivative of x squared

00:01:10.755 --> 00:01:12.170
and we figured out 2x.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.680
But let's say we didn't
know this already.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.170
You could probably figure it
out intuitively, how you can

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.070
kind of do this operation
that we did here, how

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.450
you can do it backwards.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.830
So in this case the notation--
well we know it's x squared--

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.870
but the notation for trying to
figure out 2x is the derivative

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.920
of what, we could say that--
let's say 2x is the

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.410
derivative of y.

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.050
So 2x is the derivative of y.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.150
Let's get rid of this of what.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.270
Then we can say this.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.260
We can say that y is equal to--
and I'm going to throw some

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.990
very fancy notation at you and
actually I'll explain why we

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.500
use this notation in a couple
presentations down the road.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.680
But you just have to know at
this point what the notation

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.925
means or what it tells you to
really do, which really is

00:02:03.925 --> 00:02:06.070
just the antiderivative or
the indefinite integral.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.340
So we could say that y is
equal to the indefinite

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.350
integral 2x dx.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.220
And I'm going to explain what
this squiggly line here is and

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.690
dx, but all you have to know is
when you see the squiggly line

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.700
and this dx and then something
in between, all they're asking

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.370
is they want you to figure out
what the antiderivative

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.060
of this expression is.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.550
And I'll explain later
why this is called the

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:33.340
indefinite integral.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.350
And actually this notation
will make a lot more sense

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.970
when I show you what a
definite integral is.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.000
But let's just take it for
granted right now that an

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
indefinite integral-- which I
just drew here, it's kind of

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.450
like a little squirrely thing--
is just the antiderivative.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.350
So y is equal to the
antiderivative essentially,

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.150
or the indefinite integral
of the expression 2x.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.270
So what is y equal to?

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.210
Well y is obviously
equal to x squared.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:03.220
Let me ask you a question.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.830
Is y just equal to x squared?

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.660
Because we took the derivative,
and clearly the derivative

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.575
of x squared is 2x.

00:03:10.575 --> 00:03:14.320
But what's the derivative
of x squared-- what's the

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.880
derivative x squared plus 1?

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.500
Well, the derivative of
x squared is still 2x.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.100
What's the derivative of 1?

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.460
Right, derivative of 1
is 0, so it's 2x plus

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.540
0, or still just 2x.

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:37.570
Similarly, what's the
derivative of x squared plus 2?

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.050
Well the derivative of
x squared plus 2 once

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.620
again is 2x plus 0.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.200
So notice the derivative
of x squared plus

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.890
any constant is 2x.

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.390
So really y could be x
squared plus any constant.

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.420
And for any constant
we put a big c there.

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:56.960
So x squared plus c.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.100
And you'll meet many calculus
teachers that will mark this

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.600
problem wrong if you forget to
put the plus c when you do

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.340
an indefinite integral.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.360
So you're saying Sal, OK,
you've showed me some notation,

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.880
you've reminded me that the
derivative of any constant

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.640
number is 0, but this really
doesn't help you solve

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:15.270
an indefinite integral.

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.950
Well let's think about a way--
a systematic way if I didn't do

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.200
it for you already--
that we could solve an

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.480
indefinite integral.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.540
Let me clear this.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.615
A bolder color I think would
make this more interesting.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:45.300
Let's say we said y is equal to
the indefinite integral of--

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.220
let me throw something
interesting in there.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:54.350
Let's say the indefinite
integral of x cubed dx.

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.510
So we want to figure out some
function whose derivative

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.470
is x to the third.

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:02.620
Well how can we
figure that out?

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.540
Well just from your intuition,
you probably think, well it's

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:10.420
probably something times x
to the something, right?

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:19.116
So let's say that y is
equal to a x to the n.

00:05:19.116 --> 00:05:27.910
So then what is dy/dx, or
the derivative of y is n.

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.390
Well we learned this in
the derivative module.

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.320
You take the exponent, multiply
it by the coefficient.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.480
So it's a times n.

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:42.820
And then it's x to
the n minus 1.

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.810
Well in this situation we're
saying that x to the third is

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:50.330
this expression, it's
the derivative of y.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.500
This is equal to
x to the third.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:58.220
So if this is equal to x to
third, what's a and what's n.

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.360
Well, n is easy to figure out.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.670
n minus 1 is equal to 3.

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:07.430
So that means that
n is equal to 4.

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.190
And then what is a equal to?

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.770
Well a times n is equal to 1,
right, because we just have a 1

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:18.410
in this coefficient, this has
a starting coefficient of 1.

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:20.255
So a times n is 1.

00:06:20.255 --> 00:06:23.210
If n is 4, than a must be 1/4.

00:06:26.206 --> 00:06:30.780
So just using this definition
of a derivative, I think we now

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:33.340
figured out what y is equal to.

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:41.620
y is equal to 1/4
x to the fourth.

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.220
I think you might start
seeing a pattern here.

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:46.230
Well how did we get
from x to the third to

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:47.640
1/4 x to the fourth?

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:51.940
Well, we increased the exponent
by 1, and whatever the new

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:56.050
exponent is, we multiply it
times 1 over that new exponent.

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:59.920
So let's think if we can do
a generalized rule here.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:05.810
Oh, and of course, plus c.

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:08.360
I would have failed this exam.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:13.260
So let's make a general rule
that if I have the integral

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:18.210
of-- well, since we already
used a, let's say-- b

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:23.670
times x to the n dx.

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:24.650
What is this integral?

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:27.420
This is an integral sign.

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:33.630
Well my new rule is, I raise
the exponent on x by 1, so it's

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:36.880
going to be x to the n plus 1.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:40.980
And then I multiply x times
the inverse of this number.

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:45.380
So times 1 over n plus 1.

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:47.580
And of course I had that
b there all the time.

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:50.310
And one day I'll do a more
vigorous-- more rigorous proof

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:53.520
and maybe it will be vigorous
as well-- as to why this b

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:56.490
just stays multiplying.

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:59.390
Actually I don't have to do too
rigorous of a proof if you just

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:04.030
remember how a derivative is
done, you just multiply this

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:05.830
times the exponent minus 1.

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:10.190
So here we multiply the
coefficient times 1 over

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:11.530
the exponent plus 1.

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:13.630
It's just the
inverse operation.

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:16.460
So let's do a couple of
examples like this really fast.

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:18.820
I have a little time left.

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:22.420
I think the examples, at
least for me, really

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:23.200
hit the point home.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.520
So let's say I wanted to
figure out the integral

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:31.310
of 5 x to the seventh dx.

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:35.850
Well, I take the exponent,
increase it by one.

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:39.910
So I get x to the eighth, and
then I multiply the coefficient

00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:42.100
times 1 over the new exponent.

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:45.920
So it's 5/8 x to the eighth.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.250
And if you don't trust me,
take the derivative of this.

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:56.740
Take the derivative d/dx
of 5/8 x to the eighth.

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:59.970
Well you multiply 8 times 5/8.

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:04.450
Well that equals 5 x to the--
and now the new exponent will

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:08.600
be 8 minus 1-- 5 x
to the seventh.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:10.880
Oh, and of course, plus c.

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.090
Don't want to
forget the plus c.

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:15.680
So I think you have a
sense of how this works.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.990
In the next presentation I'm
going to do a bunch more

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:19.960
examples, and I'll also
show you how to kind of

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:21.320
reverse the chain rule.

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.270
And then we'll learn
integration by parts, which is

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:25.720
essentially just reversing
the product rule.

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:26.330
See you in the next
presentation.
