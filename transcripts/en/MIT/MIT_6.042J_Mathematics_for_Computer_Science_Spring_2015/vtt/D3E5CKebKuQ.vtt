00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.890
PROFESSOR: Understanding
proofs includes the ability

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:05.580
to spot mistakes in them.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.350
And as a test of
that skill and also

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:10.250
your understanding
of induction, let

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.190
me see if I can put
one over on you.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.510
I'm going to show you a
bogus proof by induction.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.960
And I'm going to prove something
that's patently absurd.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.600
Namely, that all horses
have the same color.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.470
Say they're all black.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.480
So, there's a bunch of
black horses with maybe

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.065
some highlighted brown manes.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.870
I'm going to prove
this by induction.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.750
And for a start, there's no
n mentioned in the theorem,

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.620
so that's common for
various kinds of things

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.190
that you need to
prove by induction.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.212
So I have to rephrase
it in terms of n.

00:00:48.212 --> 00:00:49.670
It's going to be
by induction on n.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.110
The induction
hypothesis is going

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.760
to be that any set consisting
of exactly n horses

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.390
will all have the same color.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.090
Let's proceed to prove this.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.910
Now, I'm going to use the base
case n equals 1, just because I

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.730
don't want to distract you with
suspicions that the base case

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.230
n equals 0, that is no
horses, is cheating somehow.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.480
It would be, in fact, be
perfectly legitimate to start

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.680
with n equals 0 and argue that
all the horses in the empty set

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.209
have the same color,
because there's

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:23.250
nothing in the empty set.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.020
However, let's
not get into that.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.275
We'll start with n equals one.

00:01:26.275 --> 00:01:30.160
And indeed, if you look
at any set of one horse,

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.420
it is the same color
of it as itself.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.180
And in fact, I've proved
the base case n equals 1.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.910
Let's keep going.

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.950
Now, in the inductive
step, I'm allowed

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.210
to assume that n horses
have the same color, where

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.330
n is any number greater
than or equal to 0.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.390
Now right here, students
complain that that's not fair,

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.450
because you're already
assuming something false

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:54.870
and that's absurd.

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.800
Well, yeah, it is absurd.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.460
But that can't be the problem.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.430
I'm just allowed to assume
an induction hypothesis.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.590
All I have to do is prove
that n implies n plus 1.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.090
Since it's absurd,
there ought to be

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.759
some problem with the proof.

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.699
Well, let's watch
and see if there's

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:12.790
a problem with the proof.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.287
So again, I can assume
that any set of n horses

00:02:15.287 --> 00:02:16.120
have the same color.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.220
I have to prove that any
set of n plus 1 horses

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.790
have the same color.

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:21.770
How will I do that?

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.340
Well, there's a set
of n plus 1 horses,

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.920
and let's consider the
first n of those horses.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.430
Now by induction hypothesis,
the first n of them

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.840
have the same color.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.310
Black, maybe.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.600
Also by induction hypothesis,
the second set of n horses--

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.140
that is, all but the first
horse-- have the same color.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.020
And what that tells me is that
the first and the last horse

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.400
have the same color as all
of the horses in the middle.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.670
And therefore, in fact, they
all have the same color.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.960
End of proof, QED.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.700
So, there had better
be something wrong.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.620
And what's wrong?

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.520
Well, what's wrong is
that the proof that P of n

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.720
implies P of n plus 1 is wrong.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.510
It looked good, but
the proof that P of n

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.190
implies P of n plus 1 has to
work for all n greater than

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.490
or equal to the base case.

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.950
And if you look
at this proof, it

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.770
doesn't work in the base case.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.510
When n is 1 and you're trying
to go from the base case

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.510
to two and so on by implication,
the proof breaks down.

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.215
Because what happens with
our argument in the case

00:03:38.215 --> 00:03:41.690
that we're trying to prove
that P of n implies P of n

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.020
plus 1 in the case that n
equals 1, well in that case,

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.450
there aren't any middle horses.

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.650
N plus 1 is 2, so
there's a first horse.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.440
And that's the first n horses.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.260
And then the second half of set
of n horses is the other horse,

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.940
and there are no middle
horses that they both have

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.550
a color in common with.

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.121
So, the proof just broke there.

00:04:05.121 --> 00:04:07.120
But, you might not have
noticed because that was

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.230
the only place it was broken.

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.290
This is a case where we were
misled by ellipsis, by the way.

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.500
Where because I was
drawing n plus 1 horses

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.089
with-- showing a lot of horses
with dots in the middle,

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:21.990
it looked like there were some.

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.070
But they weren't.

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.590
And again, as I said,
the point though

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.960
is that the only
fallacy in this proof

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.280
was that it didn't
work when n was one.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.510
But it certainly
worked for implying

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.570
that if all sets of two
horses are the same, that does

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.160
imply that all sets of three
horses are the same color.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.600
And again, it's a false,
we'll imply anything,

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.770
kind of example.

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.532
But even here, the
proof was logically OK.

00:04:51.532 --> 00:04:53.240
But if it breaks in
one place, if there's

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.940
one domino that's missing from
the line when the one before it

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.480
falls, the rest of
them stop falling

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.100
and the proof breaks down.
