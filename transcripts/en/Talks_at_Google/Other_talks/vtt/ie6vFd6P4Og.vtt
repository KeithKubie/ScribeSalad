00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:17.030
TED McDONALD: So I just got done having an
excellent lunch here, per usual, um, some

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:18.580
of my other campus visits.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.760
I'm telling you guys have it made when it
comes to food.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.450
So thank you Google for a terrific lunch.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.550
Those of you can see me closely see that I'm
sporting a black eye today.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:37.590
I have two Siberian huskies who I'm trying
to train to not want to chase squirrels.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:45.230
And it's not easy to do because something
runs quickly by you -- I run a lot in Volunteer

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.179
Park -- and you have two dogs that I often
run with a tether on, so I'm not holding them

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:51.699
and I'm like running with them.

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:55.909
And usually, we're in like this really fluid,
moving great together.

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:01.210
And I can use voice commands and I can -- I
kind of have various ways to keep them doing

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:07.120
 -- we're all kind of a pack and I'm sort
of the alpha, at least that's what I'm hoping.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:14.390
And some squirrels or a squirrel went by in
a somewhat narrow path and suddenly I found

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.299
myself in a branch and stopping.

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:21.130
A branch suddenly decided to stop me.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.250
So I have a black eye and a hurt shoulder
but other than that I think I'm okay.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.350
I'm good to go.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:34.700
I actually did this the day before -- I gave
a talk last week at the Pacific Lutheran University's

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.729
 -- they had a international symposium on
sport and recreation.

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.280
And I didn't realize I was getting a black
eye.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.659
I guess it -- it happened the day before and
I guess -- well, I guess some of you have

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:47.659
had black eyes sometimes.

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.909
I guess it doesn't just like suddenly you
have a black eye.

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.540
So I was, like, didn't really know I had a
black eye, but everybody was looking at me

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:54.540
so funny.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.580
I thought just like, gee, I guess I must look
really funny.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.479
I mean, that's probably true, too, but nonetheless
that's the story on that.

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.130
Anyway, I don't know how many of you know
me from reading the book 'Born to Run' or

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:12.510
having checked out my blog, Barefoot Ted's
Adventures, but I'll tell you it's been an

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:23.680
incredible experience to have become sort
of a person who my own personal journey to

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:32.140
find a way to run joyfully to sort of do things
that I sort of didn't think I was ever going

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.819
to be able to do, and then sort of put my
mind to it.

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.780
And start really investigating what it means
to be able to run and whether or not this

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:47.420
is something I was going to be able to do
in my life for longer than an hour without

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.900
pain led to me where I am talking to you today.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:57.790
And the story goes like this: When I was a
younger person, I remember there was a -- my

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.569
family ran the Santa Monica Pier carousel
in Santa Monica.

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:05.840
I'm kind of from a carousel family, if you
can imagine that.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:12.290
But the son of Alan Cranston, who was a famous
California senator, was having his 40th birthday

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.099
party at the carousel, and he was going to
run his first marathon.

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:19.840
And I thought, my goodness, 40-year old running
a marathon.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.300
You know, this is his first marathon.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.950
I was just so intrigued that somebody that
old -- I think I was 20 at the time -- would

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.500
ever even be able to do that.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.501
And I got to know him and I was sort of intrigued.

00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:34.489
And he really had a successful run, and he
was talking about how great it was and kind

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.230
of sharing with me his experience as a runner.

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.989
And I -- in the back of my mind, I sort of
filed something there that, perhaps when I

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:49.030
was going to be turning 40, I think that I
might try to make that attempt at a marathon.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.750
So anyway, about seven years ago, my 40th
birthday was coming – was going to be coming

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.310
up, and I thought, well, now's the time to
give it a try.

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.329
So I'd done a little running here and there.

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:08.980
I ran, you know, some in high school and while
I was -- I remember the first thing I did

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:15.000
after graduating from UC Berkley, I was studying
Japanese and Rhetoric -- the first thing I

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.650
did after I got out was I started running
again.

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:24.210
And I thought -- it seemed so enjoyable to
suddenly start being able to put energy into

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.500
something that was so pure and -- but I could
never, I really could never get more than

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.940
a hour where I would be in so much pain, basically.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.220
And I tried different shoes, I tried all kinds
of different things.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.200
And I sort of gave it up for awhile and went
to bicycling.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.630
It's a very, very common story.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:46.250
And anyway, my 40th birthday was looming about
seven years ago, and I decided, well, I'm

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.410
going to make one more effort to crack this
nut of long distance running.

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:57.480
There's got to be now some technological solution
to this problem, and so I started Googling

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.480
"lowest impact shoe" and various things.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.960
And I came up with a great find.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:10.350
And it's -- it's a company out of Switzerland
called Kangoo Jumps – I believe is the name

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:17.090
 -- or Kangoo Boots and they literally make
a boot-like footwear that has a, kind of like

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:18.800
a leaf spring built into it.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.699
And you put these on and you can literally
bounce.

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:25.160
I mean you can bounce around the -- and I
thought yes.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.699
And they had like a, you know, they had sort
of testimonials and various people who had

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:34.490
tried, you know, people that had various problems
with impact and they had gotten these shoes.

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:40.090
And I think they had evidence showing that
this shoe was the most impact-resisting shoe

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.090
on the market.

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.600
And so it was like, right on.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:49.660
And I -- right away e-mailed them and I -- they
told me, oh, it's a great timing.

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:55.979
We're having this newest version of the shoe
coming out that's even got more spring.

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:58.080
And I was going to have to like wait like
a month.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.350
I was just -- whenever you have to wait for
something it's just like building up the intensity

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:03.241
of how wonderful it's going to be.

00:06:03.241 --> 00:06:09.870
And I was just imagining myself sort of bouncing
through the foothills and just -- I was going

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:12.569
to be coming a living embodiment of Tigger.

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:17.000
I had like -- I'm built so strong, I've got
strong legs and I'm strong.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.979
And I thought if with regular running shoes
I could do an hour without pain, and for me

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:26.660
I was always assuming that marathon runners
and long distance runners, those guys it's

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.200
all about enduring pain.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.710
That's what I assumed, based on my experience.

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:37.050
So I thought if I could go on hour with the
best running shoes, I figured I'm going to

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:40.470
be able to do like two hours like right away,
like first day.

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:46.080
So anyway, long story short my Kangoo Jumps
came and I put my Kangoo Jumps on, so damn

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.310
excited and I was bouncing around the yard.

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:56.500
And instead of one hour where I was in my
case kind of lower back pain, 15 minutes later,

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:01.069
I'm feeling the same problems, the tightness
in the legs and the various other things.

00:07:01.069 --> 00:07:03.199
And I was just like, oh my gosh, you know.

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:05.139
It was just like you got to be kidding me.

00:07:05.139 --> 00:07:07.759
I took the dial, turned to 11, 11 didn't work.

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:11.440
And I don't know about you guys but I'm one
of these kind of problem solvers that I like

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.310
to like -- I like to test the extremes.

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:18.569
Even on some computer coding stuff I do, I'm
like go over let's do this oh,crap that's

00:07:18.569 --> 00:07:19.569
all screwed up.

00:07:19.569 --> 00:07:20.569
Go over here, don't do this.

00:07:20.569 --> 00:07:21.580
Oh, that's kind of screwed up.

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:24.090
And somewhere in the middle, I find a solution.

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:25.789
So 11 didn't work.

00:07:25.789 --> 00:07:31.580
I had the best, most impact-resisting shoe
in the world, 15 minutes later, ain't going

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:32.970
to be going anywhere soon.

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:36.860
And thankfully the kind of prototypes I had
broke, I got to send them back.

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:44.379
They were rather expensive and, well, anyway,
I found myself kind of confronted with a dead

00:07:44.379 --> 00:07:45.379
end.

00:07:45.379 --> 00:07:50.009
And I didn't right away think about barefooting,
but I had been doing a lot of barefooting

00:07:50.009 --> 00:07:51.009
already.

00:07:51.009 --> 00:07:55.440
I'd been doing some barefoot hiking, and so
I thought maybe I'm just going to be a hiker.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:56.550
Maybe I'll be a barefoot hiker.

00:07:56.550 --> 00:08:01.491
So I Googled "barefoot hiking," and well of
course, there are barefoot hikers in the world.

00:08:01.491 --> 00:08:05.370
And there are barefoot hikers forums and there
are barefoot hiker events.

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:09.281
So I'm looking at all this barefoot hiking
stuff, and I'm thinking that's cool I've been

00:08:09.281 --> 00:08:10.281
doing that a lot.

00:08:10.281 --> 00:08:16.770
And I think it's actually been very beneficial
to me to have had that background before I

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:17.940
go further in the story.

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:24.970
But nonetheless, while I was looking at the
barefoot hiking website, there was a little

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:29.009
link down at the bottom to barefoot running.

00:08:29.009 --> 00:08:34.230
And before I clicked that, or about at the
same moment that I clicked that link over,

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:39.450
and it happened to be a link over to -- the
famous barefooter named Barefoot Ken Bob,

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:43.330
this bearded, long-haired guy that works over
at Cal State Long Beach in Southern California

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:49.590
who had had a website sort of on barefoot
running for several years.

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:55.830
Before I clicked on that, sort of like a flood
of memories of various things in my own experience

00:08:55.830 --> 00:09:03.710
that made me remember that indeed there were
or had been perhaps in my mind at the moment

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:09.660
biomechanically perfect individuals in this
world who had been able to achieve great things

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:11.320
barefooting.

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:16.320
I'd remembered Zola Budd, if any of you are
older than me or about the same age, you probably

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.160
have remembered or heard about her, an Olympic
athlete runner.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:25.720
But I also started remembering my own father's
experience as a barefooter in high school

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:28.560
and football it was very common to do a lot
of training in barefoot.

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:34.510
I remember my aunt who had some high school
track records, and her bemoaning the fact

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:39.470
that somewhere I think it was '64 that the
essentially the sporting goods associations

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:43.190
in the United States lobbied and made it so
that you had start wearing sport shoes in

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:44.320
high
school sports.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:48.670
Before that, I went and investigated -- this
was quite fascinating, entire cross country

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:50.630
teams would be barefoot.

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:51.920
Barefoot training was not unusual.

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:59.480
Matter of fact, barefooting had kind of had
a boom even previous to 50 years ago today.

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:03.730
Something I'll tell you, some of you who have
read 'Born to Run' know already, even previous

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:07.890
to that there were people, like there was
a fellow from Australia named Herb Elliot,

00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:12.870
one of the early Australians to be able to
get some medals in track and field.

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:18.001
And he had this kind of wacko coach named
Percy Cerutty who apparently took these guys

00:10:18.001 --> 00:10:23.730
and had them training like indigenous people
of Australia, and had them running barefoot

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:27.350
all over the place, and ended up having great
efficacy for these guys.

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:32.550
And matter of fact Herb Elliot, a barefooter
runner, was on the cover of Sports Illustrated

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:35.840
twice, once in the late 50s and again in the
early 60s.

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:41.410
So there was a whole generation of people,
my father and my aunt and others, that barefoot

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:46.680
running in and on its face was not unusual
and furthermore, running in shoes that weren't

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:50.190
padded or cushioned in any way was not unusual.

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:54.960
And matter of fact, part of the training techniques
of being able to learn how to run this way,

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:58.810
either by default based on the fact that you
didn't have any padding in your shoe or because

00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:02.420
you had a great coach and you learned how
to run well, you learned how to run in a way

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:04.340
that wasn't pounding the hell out of you.

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:10.170
These people that ran marathons back before
the padded shoe, weren't taking on as much

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:14.140
impact as you might imagine based on the way
most people think they need shoes today.

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:18.850
But anyway, all of these things started flooding
through my mind including, I had just been

00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:24.930
to -- my daughter had been in a triathlon,
a kids' triathlon thing, and I remember the

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:27.560
first place kid running through carrying his
shoes.

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:30.421
So just a flood of memories.

00:11:30.421 --> 00:11:35.060
And then, of course, I even remembered in
the newspapers the Tarahumara, the Indians

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:39.590
from Northern Mexico, would come and race
this one race near where I'd grown up called

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:40.590
the Angeles Press 100.

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:42.660
And they'd come and run in these shoes that
were made out of old tires.

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:48.890
I mean, I don't know if you've ever put a
tire on your foot and started running, you'll

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:52.660
find out real quickly there's no cushioning
in a tire at all.

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:56.120
Great protection, though, if you decide that
you want to step on -- start running down

00:11:56.120 --> 00:12:00.200
a hill at high speed and suddenly find yourself
stepping on sharp rocks or wanting to brake

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:03.490
to make a turn. In that case, I would say
they are awesome.

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:09.220
So anyway, I clicked that click and went over
to Ken Bob's site and I was like okay, here

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:10.220
we go.

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:11.220
Let me just see what this guy has to say.

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:16.150
And I -- what I did I very methodically read
everything he had written, followed through

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:22.040
every link that linked from his website, went
to his Yahoo forum and read every input that

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:27.440
had started from when he – when he had started
this forum.

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:32.470
And slowly but surely, I think that I took
in from that all of the things, the ideas

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:37.050
about what kind of form I would expect, how
far I would -- you know, what kind of things

00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:41.110
I would have to look out for to start this
journey of barefoot running.

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:44.880
At this point, I hadn't really tried it, so
I had no idea what I was going to expect.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.380
So I read all that.

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:49.370
I think three days later, I'd completed reading
everything.

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:56.320
I had read every article, every link, and
I was like -- sounds like I'm good to go.

00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:03.950
So I went out and unbelievably -- I'd been
like I'd said I'd been running periodically

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:06.120
all my life, so I knew kind of what to expect.

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.860
I knew about running.

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:13.910
But when I applied myself in this new kind
of style of running which was much more about

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:18.120
learning how to land more on the forefoot
or more up on the front part of my foot rather

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:25.170
than on my heel that involved having a much
quicker cadence, a quicker turnover of my

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:26.290
feet.

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:31.910
And it was like an instantaneous epiphany
that this was -- and by the way, I'm running

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:35.930
at this point I'm running on asphalt, concrete
and then eventually to some horse trails but

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:40.850
it was like instantaneously recognizable to
me that I had found something very important.

00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:44.850
I'd discovered something extraordinarily important
that was going to change my life.

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:47.720
It was 45 minutes later that I finally got
home.

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:54.500
I purposefully stopped because I figured I
better, didn't want to err on over exuberance.

00:13:54.500 --> 00:14:00.450
But it was like the most important 45 minutes
of my life at that point.

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:07.260
I had for the first time run barefoot in my
life and I wasn't experiencing any pain.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.460
I wasn't experiencing any back pain.

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:12.120
I wasn't experiencing any pounding.

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:15.390
It was so amazing.

00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:21.820
Literally from that day until now, it was
about seven years ago, I have been able to

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:27.180
continuously progress on this little journey
of mine, and record it and share what I've

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:29.220
found and discovered in the process.

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:34.620
And it turns out indeed it's not a -- it's
not an unusual event.

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:37.920
I'm not the only one who's had this epiphany.

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:44.080
It turns out at this point in history, in
our moment of time, in our new generation

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:49.140
who never really even thought or considered
barefoot running, at this moment in time primarily

00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:52.570
because of the book 'Born to Run', it's had
a huge influence.

00:14:52.570 --> 00:15:00.500
And a whole bunch of research that's either
coming out or is about to come out in -- and

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:05.440
probably Dr. Lieberman's stuff from Harvard
being the most important, is that you're going

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:10.270
to start seeing the beginning it's already
started of a paradigm shift, I believe, in

00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:14.270
the way we look at what it means to be human
and what it means to run.

00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:23.880
And that leads me to what I want to say about
that, which is, an amazing thing.

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:29.991
It just so happened that as I discovered this
for myself, and the first thing I thought

00:15:29.991 --> 00:15:31.690
was, my goodness.

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:34.470
Well, first of all well let's see how far
I can take this.

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:36.690
I mean am I going to break down here soon?

00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:38.290
Let's see what I can do.

00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:43.810
And it turned out that the fellow I was following
and learning from was this guy Ken Bob, Barefoot

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:44.810
Ken Bob.

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:47.670
And he had been, his thing that year was to
run a marathon a month barefoot.

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:52.420
And I thought okay, well, maybe I should start
training or preparing myself to try to run

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:53.420
a barefoot marathon.

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:56.540
I've never run a marathon before and my 40th
birthday wasn't quite here yet.

00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:59.780
So that would be the -- that would be the
ticket.

00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:02.700
That would be to determine whether or not
this has legitimacy.

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:04.110
Am I really going to be able to do this?

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:05.110
Am I going to break down?

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:06.140
Am I going to start having issues?

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:07.140
Whatever.

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:09.460
Well I didn't have any issues.

00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:11.741
I continued to run practically every day.

00:16:11.741 --> 00:16:18.540
Ended up joining an incredible, mostly Mexican-American
and Mexican National running group called

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:19.570
the Wild Mountain Runners.

00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:24.830
And these guys were hard -- for my friends,
my Mexican-American friends in Los Angeles,

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:29.010
running is right up there alongside boxing
as far as machismo goes.

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:32.620
They don't run -- they don't run for joy as
much as I do.

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:37.260
They were running to sort of like, I don't
know master themselves in a way.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:43.140
And I would follow these guys on these, about
six months after I started running, I got

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:44.180
in this club, and they would take me out on
these runs in the mountains.

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:49.930
I mean, it got to the point by the time I
was done from our mountain run, when I got

00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:52.910
down to the asphalt, asphalt was cream to
me.

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:56.250
Asphalt was like the answer of all of our
ancestors' prayers.

00:16:56.250 --> 00:17:00.830
Any kind of smooth surface where you could
sort of tune out completely and not have to

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:05.890
be so hyper-focused on what you were doing
was like a dream come true.

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:11.010
When you're running trails, particularly the
Southern California mountain trails, literally

00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:14.040
every footfall is a chess move.

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:20.260
And you find out real quickly that you're
not -- the reason you have this capacity,

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:25.190
and this is what I really started focusing
on, this capacity to move over incredibly

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:30.890
complex moonscape-type terrains in such a
way that you're in each step being able to

00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:36.260
find the sweet spots, if they exist, in real
time is an incredible place to get to.

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:41.990
When you start, and I think this is what barefooting
does, and I talk about this a lot but barefooting

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:44.620
forces you to become present.

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:47.170
You are mindful of what you're doing.

00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:52.670
You're no longer the disconnected robotic
runner who from their footwear up to their

00:17:52.670 --> 00:18:00.220
headgear are no longer even connected to their
body, not sensitized to the incredibly sophisticated

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:07.580
systems that we've inherited that are mostly
preconscious but that require the ability

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:09.360
to feel the world.

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:13.370
Have you ever wondered why you have so much
feeling on the bottom of your feet?

00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:17.660
Have you ever contemplated?

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:23.940
Is it because God or the evolutionary gods
or whatever it is that swerved us to get here

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:27.820
decided they wanted to laugh as we had to
anymore nimbly make our way over the ground

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:30.120
or does it have some purpose?

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:34.830
And indeed, when you really start thinking
about it, and then you start actually understanding

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:41.370
what's going on, all that sensory input is
incredibly interfacing directly with your

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:42.370
brain.

00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:46.430
It's this concept – you've heard of proprioception
which many writers who write about

00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:49.230
wax eloquent and call it our sixth sense.

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:53.500
And the more I understand it the more I indeed
believe it is a kind of sixth sense.

00:18:53.500 --> 00:19:03.500
However, it's a sense that requires the ability
to feel, primarily the ability to feel impacts.

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:12.140
And the ability to feel that in real time,
your body is able to do amazing things, i.e.,

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:18.240
instead of you becoming a disconnected robotic
mover who just sort of takes impact in you

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:23.740
as you move, you when get sensitized and are
capable to connect with the proprioception

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:27.050
in your own body, your body responds quickly.

00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:31.030
I little coaching helps, and that's why I
do that but ultimately people would discover

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:33.040
this on their own.

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:35.560
Your body won't let you pound the hell out
of yourself.

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:40.800
It actually is able to in real time allow
to make movements in a way that instead of

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:45.470
being disconnected and pound, you end up starting
to see that the impact and the way you land

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:48.630
and the way you move ends up becoming extraordinarily
smooth.

00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:53.140
And instead of having hard edges in your movement
when you're running, you start getting this

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:55.170
feeling of a kind of a flow.

00:19:55.170 --> 00:20:00.680
And indeed, I believe running with my dogs
and looking at big cats and other animals

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:05.260
that move well, it's this kind of ability
to have your movement to be flowing, no hard

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:06.270
edges.

00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:11.640
And indeed in Nature magazine this month,
Lieberman has his research, cover story matter

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:19.420
of fact, showing him studying an unshod group
in Kenya and a shod group having them run

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:24.170
over these impact plates and photographing
them as they run by.

00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:28.960
The people who put on the shoe, suddenly you
have a whole cohort, a whole generation in

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:33.600
our case, of people who by disconnecting from
their body and early on the cushioning was

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:34.600
minimal.

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:38.560
But let's say in the early 70s, the beginning
of the cushioning of a shoe before that basically

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:42.520
your sole is well, there's no cushioning per
se.

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:47.780
There's generally protection from sharp things
and uncomfortable things that you might step

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:50.590
on but cushioning itself and the concept of
it wasn't there yet.

00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:52.841
So the impact feeling is still there.

00:20:52.841 --> 00:20:53.841
You're still able to run.

00:20:53.841 --> 00:20:56.200
You sort of get connected to that feeling.

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:59.800
The beginning of the cushioning, I mean somebody
could do like a evolutionary -- I believe

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:05.410
it's going to be a dying branch -- but the
evolutionary branch of the beginning of the

00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:11.640
cushioning in the foot of the whole cohort
of runners, and the beginning slowly but surely

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:16.950
of people who could start running in a way
that they weren't let's say evolved to run,

00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:20.660
i.e., landing with their heel out in front
of them with their leg extended.

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:24.780
You do that for too long, too fast and you
won't be doing it too long and too fast very

00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:25.890
long anymore.

00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:30.980
But anyway, the beginning of that change requiring
more padding, requiring a bigger heel, requiring

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:34.700
more -- it's kind of like you get into this
self-fulfilling kind of prophecy.

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:39.110
Of like you need more cushioning and you need
more heel because you're taking more impact

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:41.960
because you're running in a style that you
weren't designed to run and so forth.

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:45.420
And finally we get ourself to the point where
we are today.

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:49.200
Most people, if you interview them or talk
to them and I had a chance to do this just

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:54.680
the other day, college students, you think,
now in order to run, I'm assuming you probably

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:59.370
 -- do you think -- do you need some kind
of protection or what -- right away, of course,

00:21:59.370 --> 00:22:00.490
you
need padding.

00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:04.680
And you need support and you need arch support
and you need -- and any of you have read 'Born

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:09.260
to Run' and has read the chapter I would call
the small C conspiracy chapter on running

00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:13.970
shoes and the whole propaganda that have made
people assume that they needed all of those

00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:18.350
things, you'll find out real quickly that
whether or not they actually protect you from

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:23.070
anything or not, at this point, there's no
good scientific research showing that that's

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:24.130
the case.

00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:30.420
Matter of fact, the swerve, the brake seems
to be that you're way better not having anything

00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:32.250
and learning how to run well.

00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:36.870
Actually McDougall, the writer of the book
Born to Run, said it eloquently at the Google

00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:41.270
talk he did recently which was we're kind
of a culture now where we've thrown somebody

00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:44.300
into a pool and we want them to learn how
to swim.

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:48.450
And instead of just saying, and by the way,
you swim like this and you take your hand

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:52.740
over like this and kind of demonstrating how
to swim well, we just kind of throw them more

00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:57.030
expensive and fashionable and trendy new kinds
of devices that hold them up.

00:22:57.030 --> 00:22:59.400
And so they're flailing on the top of the
water.

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:04.050
When if we could just say, hey, maybe you
should just start moving smoothly like this.

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:10.000
So anyway, I -- my discovery was suddenly
like, wow, I've really got to do something

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.290
to make this -- I'm going to have to do something
to make my story, what I'm going to do, the

00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:19.600
progress that I'm going to experience -- get
out there and let other people know about

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:20.600
it.

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:26.320
So I started a Blogger blog and started recording
my progress.

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:27.950
Well, my progress went very well.

00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:35.870
And one year later, I was able to run barefooted
in a marathon and qualify for the Boston marathon,

00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:40.420
which is an -- for a lot of people it's kind
of like the Holy Grail for a marathon runner

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:44.690
to try to get a time that's good enough to
allow them to enter the Boston marathon and

00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:45.690
I did.

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:50.210
And in the process of that first year, year
and a half, I started doing a lot of research.

00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:52.710
I got very intrigued by indigenous footwear.

00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:57.360
I figured well, if our ancestors were these
great long distance runners as Lieberman was

00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:02.690
pointing out, these persistent hunters who,
for a huge period of our evolutionary history,

00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:07.750
apparently we were able to and actually, there's
some people who are still being able to do

00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:09.080
it, outrun animals.

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:14.740
Squirrels -- as far as speed goes, we're ridiculously
slow.

00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:19.320
We're like on terrestrial animals, squirrels
beat us.

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:22.250
Just about anything will beat us in the short
run.

00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:29.510
We are phenomenal, probably the best in the
world, I think it's -- it's in most cases,

00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:32.830
particularly if you ever have us running in
the middle of the day, human beings can beat

00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:36.400
out any other animals if you start adding
hours and distance to the equation.

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:41.640
And we became really sophisticated at being
able to chase down very large animals.

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:46.590
If you YouTube it right now, you'll find there's
some great footage of some San people, some

00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:50.790
of our earliest ancestors in South Africa,
doing this very thing.

00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:55.480
But it turns out there was a whole huge period
of human history where this was a very common

00:24:55.480 --> 00:25:01.490
practice of outrunning -- I mean the one on
YouTube is an 800-pound ibex that within three

00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:08.559
hours the guy – the animal, it takes off
at speed, if you're smart you do this during

00:25:08.559 --> 00:25:11.090
the middle of the day, carry some water.

00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:15.110
You, because you've got a big brain, start
being able to realize several things.

00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:16.559
You start empathizing with the animal.

00:25:16.559 --> 00:25:18.860
And you know the environment, and you know
where they are going to go.

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:20.970
So they sprint off -- bam.

00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:22.590
And it's the middle of the day.

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:26.059
Animals can only take one breath per stroke,
and eventually they're going to have to stop

00:25:26.059 --> 00:25:29.580
and start breathing because they're only cooling
down primarily through their mouth.

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:33.010
So you know where they're going, you're going
to follow their track, but you kind of get

00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:35.560
a general idea where they're going to be going
cause you know where there are some shade

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:39.510
trees, where that guy is going to want to
get to and you just keep trotting around.

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:42.370
You don't -- he's out of your sense of view.

00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:46.120
You get to where he got to, maybe he's already
rested and took off.

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:49.100
It shows -- they kind of look around and start
feeling where would they go next.

00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:54.570
Anyway, to make a long story short, after
a few hours, 3 to 6 hours depending, that

00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:56.440
animal has run itself to death.

00:25:56.440 --> 00:26:01.360
It's having heat stroke and by the time this
runner has caught up to him, trotting along

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:05.740
at his fairly leisurely pace I would say,
that animal is ready to succumb.

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:12.110
It ends up the -- in the video on YouTube,
he does spear it but it's basically almost

00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:13.110
a ritualized spearing.

00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:18.335
And he says, 'I'm sorry I'm taking your life
and I hope you're better off in the future.

00:26:18.335 --> 00:26:21.760
You're going to be feeding my family and taking
care of this and it's kind of that kind of

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:22.760
situation.

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:26.740
Well, it turns out, this was a very common
practice up until even recently.

00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:30.700
Google Book has been a great tool for me to
do research on more persistence hunting.

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:32.760
I found everything all over the place.

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:36.370
The Tarahumara were famous for chasing down
deer this way.

00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:40.340
The most interesting story I found in persistence
hunting is one tribe, I can't remember the

00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:45.340
name off the top of my head, where if you
wanted to prove you had some cojones, you

00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:47.990
would, you would persistence hunt a black
bear.

00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:51.950
Spook a black bear, it runs, you keep following
it, scaring the hell out of it, spook it again

00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:53.060
and you run that thing to death.

00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:59.640
So anyway, just to make a long story short,
I want to make people know that indeed you

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:06.450
were born, as a human, if you're a human being,
you were born with this incredible capacity.

00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:08.390
It is a -- the hallmark of our species.

00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:13.940
I think it's probably the most fundamental
human capacity and that is to be able to move

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:14.940
long distances.

00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:18.710
Not necessarily at the speeds that you see
people running marathons and things these

00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:19.710
days.

00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:23.500
It's amazing how much faster you'll run if
there's millions of dollars involved.

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:30.410
But I say that in the kind of running that
I'm really intrigued by and the kind of running

00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:36.059
that I coach and share and try to convince
others to try is a running that, first of

00:27:36.059 --> 00:27:41.550
all, is much more connected and closely associated
with the way I believe -- and I think it's

00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:47.620
pretty clear -- that we ran for millennia,
not, not 40 years.

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:53.730
Padded, high-heeled, orthotic padded shoe
boot is only about at its greatest length,

00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:54.730
40 years old.

00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:58.990
And in reality, the ones that we're seeing
these days that people think are so necessary

00:27:58.990 --> 00:28:03.640
have only been coming around since we've been
able to manufacture them overseas and start

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:06.740
 -- the bloat started about that time.

00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:12.420
But, nonetheless, once you learn how to move
the way your ancestors moved, once you learn

00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:15.930
how to run in such a way that you're not pounding
the ground and think more along the lines

00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:21.880
of a dancer approaching a stage, they're not
relying on footwear to help them do what they're

00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:22.880
going to be doing there.

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:27.550
They're relying on form and grace and strength
and connection to their body, not disconnection.

00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:33.250
And once you get rid of the big padded shoes,
and once you get rid of constantly listening

00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:37.130
to headphones while you're running and start
trying to tune into what you're doing while

00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:41.920
you're doing it, what I think you'll find
 -- and I think it's totally correlates with

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:48.860
it being such a valuable survival tool in
a sense is that movement is

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:51.150
joyful.

00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:56.420
Movement isn't about -- we didn't become successful
as a species because movement was drudgery,

00:28:56.420 --> 00:29:01.900
painful, and you know, something that led
us having to see a professional every time

00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:05.059
we did it in order to put us back together.

00:29:05.059 --> 00:29:07.490
This is not the way movement should be.

00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:12.690
Movement ultimately should be smooth, non-diminishing,
building up, and joyful.

00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:17.520
And everybody of course is probably at one
time or another either experienced or heard

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:22.610
about how the body essentially, the second
wind concept endorphins and things like this.

00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:27.390
Well, if anybody's experienced this knows
that it's an element and certainly an important

00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:28.460
element of it.

00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:32.260
But being barefoot and learning how to move
well over all kinds of different terrain both

00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:37.170
natural and manmade that's one of the -- I'm
sure some people in the back of their head

00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:40.130
are like, 'What about manmade materials -- are
so much harder than nature.'

00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:45.090
Well, all I can say is they haven't run much
in nature because nature's no friend either

00:29:45.090 --> 00:29:47.250
to the foot if you're plodding along.

00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:53.450
But once you become connected to what you're
doing and moving well, even the hardest surfaces

00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:58.670
including, for example, the sun-baked plains
where our ancestors started out, rocky plains,

00:29:58.670 --> 00:30:03.820
you'll find that learning how to move in such
a way that you're not pounding the ground

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:04.820
is joyful.

00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:05.950
It's really quite remarkable.

00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:11.020
And furthermore, when you no longer are running
 -- it seems like the only way you sell things

00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:16.830
in a consumer culture is, it's got to either
be performance-enhancing or weight-reducing.

00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:21.230
And I mean, those are two incredibly useful
things but the problem with those two things

00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:23.140
is they're all tied up with numbers.

00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:24.700
Got to have quantification.

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:26.830
How far, distance, and so forth.

00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:32.050
What I try to train people is to look at their
running far more about being, again, connected

00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:33.470
to their body.

00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:38.300
Instead of erring on the side of how far,
how fast, how long – how about how does

00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:40.550
it feel?

00:30:40.550 --> 00:30:42.220
Are you -- am I running in good form?

00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:47.450
Getting associated with the feeling of moving
well because ultimately, good running isn't

00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:50.010
about how well you can endure pain.

00:30:50.010 --> 00:30:56.820
It's how well you can remain relaxed, how
long you can remain smooth.

00:30:56.820 --> 00:31:01.059
And those should be the barometers of determining
whether or not you should continue forward

00:31:01.059 --> 00:31:02.320
on your running.

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:03.710
So I got to this point.

00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:09.380
I did the Boston Marathon, and I actually
went there and just before I went to the Boston

00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:14.679
Marathon, I -- I was -- I'd been at this point
looking all over, struggling to find some

00:31:14.679 --> 00:31:19.920
kind of minimal shoe in order to be able to
do some hundred mile races I had in my mind.

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:27.020
And low and behold, somebody sent me a link
to an Italian blog that had the -- it was

00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:32.760
in Italian, and I used Google Translate to
translate it, and suddenly I saw this shoe

00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:35.040
shaped like a foot.

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:37.650
And, I was like whoa, that looks pretty interesting.

00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:42.670
And I read all about this guy, and it's the
grandson of the founder of a company known

00:31:42.670 --> 00:31:45.799
as Vibrum, lot of people in America call it
"vibe rum".

00:31:45.799 --> 00:31:48.330
Vibrum, Vitale Bramani is the founder,

00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:50.309
Italian family-owned company still.

00:31:50.309 --> 00:31:56.549
It turns out it's one of the first products
REI imported into the United States.

00:31:56.549 --> 00:32:01.490
Vibrum sold hiking boots and of course, everybody
knows Vibrum for making famous for proprietary

00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:02.990
soleing materials.

00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:07.320
The Vitale Bramani was friends with Pirelli,
and anyway, to make a long story short, they

00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:12.309
dominate the shoe-soling business.

00:32:12.309 --> 00:32:14.520
Well, they'd never manufactured a shoe.

00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:19.861
Grandson is a yachts guy and barefooting on
a boat is actually one of the better -- Any

00:32:19.861 --> 00:32:23.960
time you're barefoot you have significantly
better balance, I don't know if you've noticed

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:27.070
that, but that's part of the role proprioception
plays for you, too.

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:28.860
And he got this guy and he spent three years.

00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:32.740
I can't imagine any other company doing this,
three years of his own, basically time and

00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:36.890
money, hired this guy who had already started
developing this shoe, and came out with this

00:32:36.890 --> 00:32:37.890
shoe, the Five Fingers.

00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:40.179
So I saw that, and I went whoa.

00:32:40.179 --> 00:32:44.630
And I immediately got in touch with the Vibrum
USA, and I got a phone call one day and it

00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:45.900
was the president of Vibrum.

00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:47.751
I didn't know it when phone call started.

00:32:47.751 --> 00:32:52.070
And then I said, 'Hey, I really think that
you should send me some of those shoes, and

00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:54.790
I'm going to test those for you, and I'll
get some other people to test them because

00:32:54.790 --> 00:32:59.650
I'm Barefoot Ted and I run marathons barefoot,
and I'll be able to tell you if that shoe

00:32:59.650 --> 00:33:00.650
is actually a barefoot shoe.'

00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:02.901
And the guy's like, 'Hold on, you're planning
on running a marathon in these shoes?'

00:33:02.901 --> 00:33:07.370
And I was like 'yeah', and he went on to tell
me how he was a 2:25 marathoner, which is

00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:10.770
a very good marathon time, probably around
world class time, he did it.

00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:12.820
And he said, 'I just really don't know about
this'.

00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:16.040
And I said, 'Well, why don't you send them
to me and I'll tell you.'

00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:22.220
So they sent me a pair and lucky for me, and
lucky for them I would say, couple weeks later,

00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:26.710
I was getting ready to make my first trip
down into the Copper Canyon to run in essentially

00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:31.330
the first inaugural Copper Canyon Ultra-marathon.

00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:35.380
And I was going to be going down there with
Christopher McDougall, who happens to the

00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:38.990
writer of that book, and if you've read the
book 'Born to Run', what I'm going to be telling

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:42.100
you from this point forward is essentially
the story of the book.

00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:47.700
So I get my Five Fingers, and I indeed wore
them and I was friggin' blown away.

00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:55.740
They were allowing me to be able to stay in
this relaxed place that I'm so convinced is

00:33:55.740 --> 00:34:01.450
very important to remain in as long as possible,
and still run on -- there's plenty of places

00:34:01.450 --> 00:34:03.430
where it's not comfortable to run barefoot.

00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:07.720
And there's plenty of situations where it
could be not so safe.

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:11.339
So this shoe was like, immediately, I was
like this is the answer.

00:34:11.339 --> 00:34:16.109
So I took that shoe, it was the early version
before they started making some of the different

00:34:16.109 --> 00:34:17.109
things they have now.

00:34:17.109 --> 00:34:22.780
And I find myself down in the Copper Canyon
of Mexico running this 50 mile race with these

00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:28.040
incredible athletes, probably the greatest
long distance runners in the world today who

00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:29.619
happened to run in these kind of shoes here.

00:34:29.619 --> 00:34:31.560
That's a thick version of it.

00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:35.100
And McDougall was recording this entire trip.

00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:40.230
He was -- he had this book in mind, planned,
didn't really have anything to do with barefoot

00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:41.950
running at the time.

00:34:41.950 --> 00:34:46.550
And so that experience ended up becoming a
life-transforming experience.

00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:51.300
Meeting the Rarámuri, the Tarahumara people,
running with some of the greatest runners

00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:54.140
in the world, being part of a great story.

00:34:54.140 --> 00:35:00.280
And actually getting a chance to have lots
and lots of other people sort of start to

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:06.020
make the same kind of transition that I have,
made me realize it was a goal that I had at

00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:07.020
the very beginning.

00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:11.980
Right, early on, after -- particularly after
I qualified for Boston and realized I could

00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:16.000
keep running like this, the first thing I
started thinking and the Five Finger shoe

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:22.880
ended up becoming the answer, I realized that
there was no way in hell that this barefoot

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:27.070
running was ever going to become a fad or
a hit in the United States unless there

00:35:27.070 --> 00:35:28.180
was a product.

00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:30.210
I knew there's just no way.

00:35:30.210 --> 00:35:33.030
You tell people, you got -- hey, it's free.

00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:34.030
It's free.

00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:35.030
It's like, okay, man.

00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:36.030
Right on.

00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:37.030
Whatever.

00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:40.280
It's like as soon as -- we are so trained
to like, you know, we purchase a solution.

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:42.640
We got to have a purchasable solution.

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:48.060
So I actually have a blog entry called Vibrum
Five Fingers, Paradigm Shifting Trojan Horse,

00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:50.100
and that's exactly how I see it.

00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:56.750
In other words, if you can get people to essentially
buy something that is a -- it has no padding.

00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:59.490
It essentially fits your foot like a glove.

00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:00.710
It has no arch support.

00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:05.730
It has no -- anything other than let's say
a thicker skin.

00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:09.710
And, by the way, the skin on the bottom of
my feet is not a hard, calloused, unfeeling

00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:10.710
thing.

00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:11.710
That's a shoe.

00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:17.190
The skin on me feet is a supple, pliable,
multi-layered feeling, living material.

00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:22.220
And indeed, I would go so far people think,
'Oh man, don't you want to get into technology?

00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:24.220
Technology or something isn't there something
better?'

00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:28.440
How about a self-healing, self-nourishing
gets stronger and smarter with use material,

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:34.940
has a direct interface with my brain, and
that -- and even better, all I have to do

00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:36.109
is eat good food to grow it.

00:36:36.109 --> 00:36:37.700
I mean, come on, give me a break.

00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:41.680
It makes a lot of sense when I'm at the farmers'
market and I'm getting ready to buy a tomato,

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:46.560
that's like 3 or 4 bucks, it's like but it's
going to be my shoe. [audience laughs]

00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:51.310
It changes the whole -- and in reality, when
you really think about it you're foot is ike

00:36:51.310 --> 00:36:52.310
nano-technology.

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:56.000
I mean you've got cells building themselves,
it's there -- it's on and on.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.190
It's so fascinating.

00:36:57.190 --> 00:37:02.130
And indeed, when you start even thinking about
it, look at all the martial arts, first thing

00:37:02.130 --> 00:37:03.260
you do, you take off your shoes.

00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:06.119
You want to be a gymnast, you want to be good
at balancing, you take off your shoes.

00:37:06.119 --> 00:37:09.500
You want to do a lot of spiritual arts, take
off your shoes.

00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:14.170
The idea of being connected and being part
of your body and being present, all of these

00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:15.810
things come with the package.

00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:18.770
And it's just such an incredible journey.

00:37:18.770 --> 00:37:21.590
So, got to have a -- something to buy.

00:37:21.590 --> 00:37:22.690
And there was that shoe.

00:37:22.690 --> 00:37:25.381
And I knew, whoa, people are going to get
that.

00:37:25.381 --> 00:37:29.300
And there're going to be able because ultimately,
let's face it.

00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:34.550
I think probably the most incredibly, apart
from the fact of having overly sensitive feet

00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:39.200
at first, many people do because essentially
we've been, essentially wearing earplugs and

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:44.290
earmuffs our whole life and wearing those
if something loud comes in, if you have earplugs

00:37:44.290 --> 00:37:48.200
and earmuffs on and something loud comes in,
you've got a emergency situation on your hands.

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:52.730
You take your earplugs and your earmuffs off,
socks and shoes, and suddenly, you're getting

00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:55.750
what seems like a lot of emergency signal.

00:37:55.750 --> 00:38:00.240
And at first, I think it's the other analogy
is sort of like going to a massage therapist

00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:02.830
and you're very tight, and they start working
on you.

00:38:02.830 --> 00:38:06.800
And you're like, lady or guy, whatever, you
know, that's -- and then oh, oh.

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:11.470
And then pretty soon it's like, 'Damn, that
feels good.'

00:38:11.470 --> 00:38:16.010
Well I think there's very much the correlation,
taking the earplugs, earmuffs off, and allowing

00:38:16.010 --> 00:38:21.420
the foot to sort of reawaken, reconnect to
the job that's it's been doing for who knows

00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:27.270
how long now but certainly eons and getting
re-in-touch with your own body.

00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:31.930
I would tell you from my own experience and
what I've seen from hundreds and, at this

00:38:31.930 --> 00:38:35.560
point, thousands of other people it's a worthwhile
journey, doesn't cost too much.

00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:37.750
But that's not the only problem.

00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:43.820
The psychological difficulty of being in public
or running and doing any of these things that

00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:45.270
society tells that's not right.

00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:46.270
It's subversive.

00:38:46.270 --> 00:38:48.810
You're running barefoot, there's something
wrong with you.

00:38:48.810 --> 00:38:52.900
It just doesn't fit the mold of what you should
be doing.

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:54.770
You're putting yourself at danger.

00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:56.200
That's the common assumption.

00:38:56.200 --> 00:39:03.650
You certainly don't have all the social markers
of being affluent, where's your brand?

00:39:03.650 --> 00:39:05.080
You're dirty.

00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:09.700
People -- I don't know how many people have
bothered, but if you want to find a good place

00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:16.270
to grow microbes just give me a hot, warm,
moist dark place, let's add periodically,

00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:18.480
some moisture and some dead skin cells.

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:23.410
For the hell of it, let's wrap it in sort
of a tox material made somewhere else by people

00:39:23.410 --> 00:39:24.510
who don't like what they're doing.

00:39:24.510 --> 00:39:28.290
But go ahead and do a microbe, do a little
sampling of that and see what see what you

00:39:28.290 --> 00:39:29.720
can grow in a Petri dish.

00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:36.350
Now go out to let's say someplace where there's
sunlight and air and hard surfaces for example.

00:39:36.350 --> 00:39:37.980
And let's find what we can find there.

00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:44.119
Oh, but what if you step on a nail, a rock,
glass, dog poop, the whole list of other possibilities.

00:39:44.119 --> 00:39:45.680
And accidents will happen.

00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:48.040
I'm sure that it does.

00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:54.780
In my long history now as a barefooter, well,
there was this incredible other set of gadgets

00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:59.570
that I inherited from my ancestors, eyeballs
and a brain.

00:39:59.570 --> 00:40:06.920
And it's amazing how a coordinated use of
all those things in real time allows me to

00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:11.920
not step on the dog poop or not step on the
various things that are out there.

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:17.109
And then ultimately, and this is the real
 -- this is the thing that I think makes my

00:40:17.109 --> 00:40:21.160
job as a coach really the only thing I do,
the only thing I'm willing to teach at this

00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:22.940
point is I do an introduction to barefoot
running.

00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:24.650
One time, you're done.

00:40:24.650 --> 00:40:27.780
I don't really think I can share it much more.

00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:32.490
And the rest is sort of self-experimentation,
but there are some little hints that you need

00:40:32.490 --> 00:40:37.170
to pick up on, and it has to do with about
the way -- instead of being the plodding kind

00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:43.000
of mover, what indigenous people used to call
us cow walkers as opposed to fox walking or

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.470
what I call robot.

00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:50.270
When you learn how to move nimbly, with a
much quicker cadence and a much gentler landing,

00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:54.099
suddenly some of the things that you're thinking
that if you stepped on how horrible it would

00:40:54.099 --> 00:40:58.619
be, when you're dealing with a living, feeling
material, you would be surprised.

00:40:58.619 --> 00:41:02.849
It doesn't want to mash down on things that
don't feel comfortable, and getting into this

00:41:02.849 --> 00:41:06.730
sort of place where you're moving very quickly
and nimbly over the ground, you start to land

00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:12.369
on something that doesn't feel very comfortable
 -- hot, holey, sharp, whatever -- you're

00:41:12.369 --> 00:41:13.650
on to your next footfall.

00:41:13.650 --> 00:41:19.050
So ultimately, a style of movement also plays
into how to be able to move in such a way

00:41:19.050 --> 00:41:22.640
that you can do well with what you've already
been given.

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:26.800
So the Five Fingers are selling like hot cakes.

00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:30.800
The first question I had for the president
after I tried them and knew that they were

00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:33.060
going to be good was, is this a stock company?

00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:34.060
And it wasn't.

00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:37.560
So sadly, I'm not a millionaire at this point
because of sales of Five Fingers.

00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:41.920
But I believe that I would have been to some
degree because at this point last year, they

00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:44.599
planned on doubling their business in the
middle of a recession.

00:41:44.599 --> 00:41:49.270
And I think the numeral five before the multiplication
symbol would have been still too small.

00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:53.690
And they're getting ready to launch a whole
bunch of new shoes in April.

00:41:53.690 --> 00:41:56.849
And furthermore, the bandwagon hasn't stopped
with them.

00:41:56.849 --> 00:42:01.760
They have a patent on their little design
there, smart them, and a pretty smart CEO.

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:07.359
But you're going to see that minimalism and
minimal shoes will become the rage because

00:42:07.359 --> 00:42:11.650
more and more people are going to basically
succumb to the reasoning that I just sort

00:42:11.650 --> 00:42:12.650
of shared with you.

00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:14.950
I hope it makes some sense.

00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:27.450
And I think with that, I will stop and take
some questions.

00:42:27.450 --> 00:42:29.650
[PAUSE]

00:42:29.650 --> 00:42:36.930
&gt;&gt; Um, I have read a little bit from that
book, so it's a very nicely

00:42:36.930 --> 00:42:37.930
written book.

00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:44.470
I would like to ask, the book is talking about
people that had nothing to do with running

00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:45.470
whatsoever.

00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:50.440
And then within a very short time, like one
year or two years, they developed into these

00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:55.530
world class athletes that are able to run
hundreds of miles literally.

00:42:55.530 --> 00:42:56.940
So how does that work?

00:42:56.940 --> 00:43:03.380
What is that gives them that ability that
they didn't know before?

00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:08.270
&gt;&gt;TED McDONALD: Well, I think you characterized
the book a little bit differently.

00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:13.910
There aren't -- there are not a lot of people
in that book -- the only person that might

00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:17.730
fit the category or the person that you just
described would be me in the book.

00:43:17.730 --> 00:43:22.710
But there are -- most of the other characters
in that book were not like beginning out -- beginners

00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:24.570
or just starting this journey.

00:43:24.570 --> 00:43:32.550
So speaking for myself, and as that probably
may be the character you're referring to,

00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:37.500
the question is -- can other people do this
essentially?

00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:39.880
Is this -- is this something that I could
do?

00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:41.019
Maybe is that -- does that simplify it?

00:43:41.019 --> 00:43:45.700
&gt;&gt; Maybe that would be the second part of
the question.

00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:46.700
&gt;&gt;TED McDONALD: Okay.

00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:52.500
So my discovery, my personal discovery, I
am a person that did just what you described

00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:59.930
went from essentially not running much, very
consistently for very long, to spending a

00:43:59.930 --> 00:44:04.859
lot of time trying to find a solution to running
in a way that I can do it safely and comfortably

00:44:04.859 --> 00:44:09.580
to realizing that this was an -- was working
for me.

00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:14.869
By the way, before I continue on this, I'm
not dogmatically a barefoot runner, nor am

00:44:14.869 --> 00:44:19.270
I -- matter of fact the only thing I'm dogmatically
dogmatic about is being not dogmatic.

00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:26.840
So ultimately, I am part of getting the story
of barefooting and – I really wanted to

00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:32.550
see it at least become part of the palette
of choices of mainstream America.

00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:34.550
But when I started out it wasn't a choice.

00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:37.840
You couldn't say I'm going to be a minimalist
runner or a barefoot runner it would be like

00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:40.940
dude that's wrong, you can't do that.

00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:44.770
So what I think McDougall says in the book
and I agree with and what I think the science

00:44:44.770 --> 00:44:50.580
backs up and I agree with, is that this capacity
to run is a fundamental human capacity, and

00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:52.830
that the foot is not a broken appendage.

00:44:52.830 --> 00:44:56.790
This is not something that we just accidentally
dragged into the future.

00:44:56.790 --> 00:44:59.170
It's there because it's incredible.

00:44:59.170 --> 00:45:02.950
It's -- it's one of the things Michelangelo
gets off on, he looks at the anatomy of a

00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:04.790
foot and he was like whoa.

00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:06.010
It's so amazing.

00:45:06.010 --> 00:45:10.369
It's such an amazing tool and yet we have
a whole generation of people who have assumed

00:45:10.369 --> 00:45:12.359
that their foot was something broken.

00:45:12.359 --> 00:45:16.290
That you know, in some cases, you'd also assume
if we could cut it off at birth that would

00:45:16.290 --> 00:45:20.880
be better but since that's barbaric, let's
just cast and protect and do everything we

00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:22.660
can to make it not get injured.

00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:29.180
And it's that attitude that we had something
that wasn't viable, that is wrong.

00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:32.020
It's -- it's kind of it's purely a psychological
thing.

00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:33.460
It's not true.

00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:38.920
The foot is -- if incrementally developed
 -- some people never -- I like to often talk

00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:42.880
about the foot and learning how to barefoot
like a language.

00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:47.000
And some people, I had a client the other
day, 64-year old guy had never been outside

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:51.910
in his life -- he was unfortunately affluent
when he was growing up and his parents didn't

00:45:51.910 --> 00:45:55.410
want him to be barefoot like all the other
kids who were having fun.

00:45:55.410 --> 00:45:56.810
He had to wear his shoes.

00:45:56.810 --> 00:45:58.440
It was like oh my God.

00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:01.700
But nonetheless, being like a language some
people are starting out with just learning

00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:02.700
the alphabet.

00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:04.680
They may have never been barefoot in their
life, let's say.

00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:06.400
That's the worst case scenario.

00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:08.570
Other people were barefoot as kids.

00:46:08.570 --> 00:46:10.320
They might have been doing barefoot sports.

00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:13.620
Surfing is a good one, that's what I was into,
and skateboarding and other things.

00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:19.410
They've may have just re-continued barefooting
for various reasons, going, living in a culture

00:46:19.410 --> 00:46:21.310
that allowed that to happen.

00:46:21.310 --> 00:46:25.900
Their movement into being able to run barefoot
or minimally is, obviously, the progress is

00:46:25.900 --> 00:46:27.000
much greater.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:32.190
The similarity is that regardless, an incremental
develop of this capacity, rather than being

00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:36.440
driven by the ego and numbers and how fast
and just everything about performance and

00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:41.720
how -- if you really get into it as orchard
growing rather than as a purchase solution,

00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:45.480
and sort of regrow your body in a sense, because
that's what you're doing.

00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:50.140
You're reawakening in some cases something
that's been in a cast its entire life.

00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:56.200
What my personal experience and looking at
having this forum and knowing about hundreds

00:46:56.200 --> 00:47:01.180
and thousands of other people who have done
the same that incremental development of this

00:47:01.180 --> 00:47:06.550
potentiality in most almost all human beings,
I would say, unless they have some significant

00:47:06.550 --> 00:47:12.290
trouble, will develop and will come about
and will be perfected.

00:47:12.290 --> 00:47:17.190
You can imagine it's quite a satisfying thing
to realize you don't need anything in order

00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:24.730
to do the one thing that we are preeminent
in the world at doing.

00:47:24.730 --> 00:47:25.750
[PAUSE]

00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:30.640
&gt;&gt;TED McDONALD: Damn, I talk a lot, don't
I?

00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:31.640
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:34.440
I know you mentioned this a couple of times,
but what if you have a flat foot, and it's

00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:40.160
painful to walk, is it still -- is it too
late for those people or can we still try

00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:41.170
something like this?

00:47:41.170 --> 00:47:43.790
&gt;&gt;TED McDONALD: Well, that's a great question.

00:47:43.790 --> 00:47:47.490
Since I didn't have flat feet, I didn't know
the answer to that but I can tell you based

00:47:47.490 --> 00:47:52.830
on reading a lot of experiences from a lot
of other people, it's sort of like some people

00:47:52.830 --> 00:48:00.280
have super high, stiff arches, some people
have flat feet, and it used to be that flat

00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:04.310
feet, by the way, would keep you out of the
military in the United States, not anymore.

00:48:04.310 --> 00:48:09.339
So if you were hoping -- hopefully we won't
even have to think that way.

00:48:09.339 --> 00:48:11.370
Maybe that's a -- that would be the better
way.

00:48:11.370 --> 00:48:18.460
But it turns out with people with the flat
feet -- imagine a foot that has not developed

00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:19.580
any strength yet.

00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:26.750
And the modality and maybe it's still this
case, it seems that the typical podiatrist

00:48:26.750 --> 00:48:35.040
modality of taking care of almost every foot
condition is to stabilize and/or stop movement.

00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:36.790
Let's immobilize this thing.

00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:43.240
Well, I think that -- and there are, believe
me, on the cutting edge of all of this stuff,

00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:46.730
this kind of activity won't -- the future
will not hold this.

00:48:46.730 --> 00:48:50.220
I know one lady in -- I'm not even going to
say the name -- who is doing some research

00:48:50.220 --> 00:48:55.400
on this topic, she's already running barefoot.

00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:58.890
She doesn't -- but she doesn't recommend this
to any of her clients yet because the research

00:48:58.890 --> 00:49:00.339
is not done yet.

00:49:00.339 --> 00:49:05.140
But the people with flat feet start developing
the strength in their feet, and it's incremental.

00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:06.300
This is like everything.

00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:07.630
It's an incremental progress.

00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:13.320
They begin to develop, as their foot develops
a full range of motion and starts developing

00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:17.680
musculature and getting used to -- they start
developing some kind of like arch.

00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:22.730
I mean, there's a lot of cases if you check
out my Google group, if you just type in "minimalist

00:49:22.730 --> 00:49:28.200
runner" it will come up, and maybe do a search
in there, and you'll see there's -- this topic's

00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:29.200
come up a lot.

00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:32.950
So I was -- at first I was intrigued because
I started to think oh, my foot is getting

00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:34.020
longer and wider.

00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:35.170
I'm like okay.

00:49:35.170 --> 00:49:39.560
Then somebody else, oh, my foot's getting
shorter and wider.

00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:40.660
And I'm like, okay.

00:49:40.660 --> 00:49:41.660
What's going on here?

00:49:41.660 --> 00:49:45.700
And then a physical therapist was explaining
to me so if I have a very, very tight foot

00:49:45.700 --> 00:49:49.840
arch, and I start giving it full range of
motion and allowing it to develop, it kind

00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:53.000
of stretches out and starts to relax a little
bit and sort of develops that way.

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:57.400
If I have a very, very flat foot, and I start
sort of developing my foot, it sort of shrinks

00:49:57.400 --> 00:49:58.400
a little bit.

00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:02.130
So all these different potentials are there.

00:50:02.130 --> 00:50:08.220
I think that it might be worthwhile if you're
concerned about safety and whatnot, try to

00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:12.170
search out and see -- and I think there are
some in Seattle, podiatrists who's along these

00:50:12.170 --> 00:50:13.170
lines.

00:50:13.170 --> 00:50:17.960
Of course, Americans have the most unhealthy
 -- I think the research shows that we have

00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:21.869
like the most foot problems per any population
in the world today but anyway.

00:50:21.869 --> 00:50:24.980
We've also got the greatest number of choices,
so.

00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:26.020
Anybody else?

00:50:26.020 --> 00:50:30.190
&gt;&gt; I think I saw in your site you were looking
at doing an Iron Man or trying to get sponsorship

00:50:30.190 --> 00:50:35.180
for an Iron Man and ride the ride on an 1890s
full Penny-farthing cycle.

00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:36.940
What's the logic behind that?

00:50:36.940 --> 00:50:40.339
&gt;&gt;TED McDONALD: Actually McDougall mentions
that in the book, too.

00:50:40.339 --> 00:50:47.960
I've got this -- before I became a barefoot
runner and this sort of proves that the psychological

00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:53.000
block for being a barefoot runner or minimalist
runner before was basically can you handle

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.410
being "other"?

00:50:55.410 --> 00:51:00.349
And my little sport before that was I learned
how to ride these high-wheeled bicycles and

00:51:00.349 --> 00:51:01.460
became really good at it actually.

00:51:01.460 --> 00:51:05.420
There's a race at Stanford University every
year that I've won once that I think it's

00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:11.640
been going on and off since 1891, down the
square, riding these high-wheelers, and I

00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:12.640
got really good at it.

00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:16.980
And then 1890 was the year I want to do an
Iron Man, as if it were that year because

00:51:16.980 --> 00:51:22.220
1890 is the last year of the Penny-farthing,
the high-wheeled bicycle actually known as

00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:25.609
an ordinary bicycle as opposed to a safety
bicycle.

00:51:25.609 --> 00:51:28.580
Because Dunlop developed pneumatic tires in
1899.

00:51:28.580 --> 00:51:33.770
So I got really intrigued by Victorian athletes,
their capacities, and it turns out around

00:51:33.770 --> 00:51:35.980
that era you had a lot of interesting things
going on.

00:51:35.980 --> 00:51:41.660
The bicycle was -- that bicycle, the ordinary
bicycle, was the first human-powered machine

00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:43.770
that we all could own essentially.

00:51:43.770 --> 00:51:48.010
And if -- most people have never ridden a
high-wheeled bicycle, but they're an extraordinary

00:51:48.010 --> 00:51:51.580
vehicle and if we lived on a planet without
an atmosphere, it would be the most efficient

00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:56.940
bicycle to ride because you're directly driving
 -- you're, you are -- there are no mechanical

00:51:56.940 --> 00:52:00.589
devices, you are there driving the wheel.

00:52:00.589 --> 00:52:07.270
Unfortunately, air and the problem of air,
wind resistance, doesn't make that as fast

00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:08.270
as it could be.

00:52:08.270 --> 00:52:11.890
But so what would an athlete of 1890 do?

00:52:11.890 --> 00:52:15.710
Indeed it turns out that I have the capacity,
and therefore I think it would be a educational

00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:19.170
thing because the bicycle itself is such an
important thing.

00:52:19.170 --> 00:52:20.190
We wouldn't be here today.

00:52:20.190 --> 00:52:24.170
I mean, out of the popularity of the bicycle
and the flows of capital that started because

00:52:24.170 --> 00:52:28.800
of it, and particularly when it became male
and female started being able to ride in 1891

00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:30.960
when the pneumatic tire came out and women
could ride a bike.

00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:32.810
And they had pantaloons.

00:52:32.810 --> 00:52:37.510
And actually, one of the early feminist movement
is the capacity to ride -- wear pants and

00:52:37.510 --> 00:52:38.930
ride a bicycle.

00:52:38.930 --> 00:52:43.700
And then of course, all that capital for the
ten years up to there leading to well, let's

00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:46.740
face it, the Wright brothers were bicycle
mechanics.

00:52:46.740 --> 00:52:50.410
The Ford -- his first big capital was from
a bicycle racer.

00:52:50.410 --> 00:52:53.270
I mean, without all of that, we wouldn't be
where we are today.

00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:59.520
However, going back to a world where human-powered
stuff, and we eat our fuel, that's my favorite

00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:00.520
thing.

00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:07.170
The idea of eating your own fuel and locomoting
your own vehicles, your two feet being the

00:53:07.170 --> 00:53:09.810
most sophisticated ones you'll ever own, that's
kind of the idea there.

00:53:09.810 --> 00:53:11.720
So it's educational and fun.

00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:14.460
I think it would be cool to do, and I'm ready
to do it.

00:53:14.460 --> 00:53:15.900
I just haven't found the good sponsor yet.

00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:23.440
Unfortunately, the ideal sponsor is companies
that started in 1890, and there are some,

00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:25.470
sadly, one of them is called Coca Cola.

00:53:25.470 --> 00:53:31.820
I don't think I would want to be -- I don't
know if I want to be a sugar water salesman.

00:53:31.820 --> 00:53:37.400
But Idaho, the Coeur d'Alene Iron Man, Idaho
became a state in 1890.

00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:46.660
So if anybody's got some interesting ideas
of who we can -- I'll cut you in a deal.

00:53:46.660 --> 00:53:47.660
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:47.660 --> 00:53:48.660
&gt;&gt;TED McDONALD: Okay, one more question.

00:53:48.660 --> 00:53:53.369
&gt;&gt; I just wanted to ask about any research
or articles or literature that you've done,

00:53:53.369 --> 00:53:57.820
if you could explain like how barefoot running
is more beneficial?

00:53:57.820 --> 00:54:02.790
Or how it takes away the pain that a lot of
us get because we wear the thick-soled shoes.

00:54:02.790 --> 00:54:07.970
Like what is the difference and why, like,
why did you personally -- why do you think

00:54:07.970 --> 00:54:09.920
that you experience less pain while running
barefoot?

00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:14.530
&gt;&gt;TED McDONALD: Well, there are -- first of
all, just to start that off -- not everybody,

00:54:14.530 --> 00:54:18.280
one of the things I like to say to people
if it's not broken, don't fix it.

00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:24.120
There's plenty of people in this room I imagine
 -- I met one earlier today, and I know a

00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:30.200
lot of others who are for one reason or another,
by the way, I found older runners to be more

00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:33.839
likely to be in this position who have been
around for awhile and actually learned how

00:54:33.839 --> 00:54:38.190
to run well before the really gargantuan stuff
came around.

00:54:38.190 --> 00:54:49.820
But there are a lot of studies, I mean,
what there aren't a lot of right yet, and

00:54:49.820 --> 00:54:54.131
I think there's going to have to be more -- there
aren't a lot of coaches or there's not a lot

00:54:54.131 --> 00:54:55.131
of how-to books.

00:54:55.131 --> 00:54:56.380
There's tons in the works.

00:54:56.380 --> 00:55:01.500
I mean, I've been, today, I've been answering
e-mails almost every day, I'm getting some

00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:09.320
kind of request to write a forum or a forward
to a book and to support or sponsor this minimal

00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:10.320
shoe.

00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:11.320
I've never had more shoes in my life.

00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:13.750
Barefoot Ted, it's just like, it's ridiculous.

00:55:13.750 --> 00:55:15.329
I mean, it's pathetic.

00:55:15.329 --> 00:55:16.869
I mean, it's over the top.

00:55:16.869 --> 00:55:19.579
But I've found some really interesting shoes
out there, too.

00:55:19.579 --> 00:55:24.270
Like one millimeter thin-soled shoes made
by -- with Kevlar and rubber so you can't

00:55:24.270 --> 00:55:25.670
get a puncture wound.

00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:30.280
But at this point, if you live around here,
you might consider coming and taking a barefoot,

00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:31.950
introduction to barefoot running class from
me.

00:55:31.950 --> 00:55:34.530
I do those.

00:55:34.530 --> 00:55:39.460
I think there has been a lot -- Runner's World
had a lot of stuff about this, and kind the

00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:42.599
debate about barefooting and shoes.

00:55:42.599 --> 00:55:47.130
I think if you do just a quick little, quick
perusal on the Internet you'll find that there's

00:55:47.130 --> 00:55:51.109
more -- I could talk for days there's just
so much stuff going on.

00:55:51.109 --> 00:55:55.130
But it's definitely -- there's definitely
resources out there.

00:55:55.130 --> 00:56:01.460
And there's no -- on the minimalist group,
Google group I have, there is the kind of,

00:56:01.460 --> 00:56:07.230
the first the tagged or the -- or the first
forum story there is sort of my advice.

00:56:07.230 --> 00:56:08.310
I recommend reading that.

00:56:08.310 --> 00:56:09.310
It's very short.

00:56:09.310 --> 00:56:11.740
And it at least gives you some basics to watch
out for.

00:56:11.740 --> 00:56:13.961
So with that I guess thank you very much.
