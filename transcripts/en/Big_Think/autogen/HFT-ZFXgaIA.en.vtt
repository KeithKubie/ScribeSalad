00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:11.750
 
oh we are now highly successful with

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:11.760
 
 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.820
 
with about twenty percent of cancer fur

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:14.830
with about twenty percent of cancer fur
 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.540
with about twenty percent of cancer fur
in fact initially you know we can do

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:18.550
in fact initially you know we can do
 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.810
in fact initially you know we can do
something the problem is the cancers

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:21.820
something the problem is the cancers
 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:27.419
something the problem is the cancers
tend to get more dangerous and resistant

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:27.429
tend to get more dangerous and resistant
 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:34.380
tend to get more dangerous and resistant
to chemotherapy and today we postpone a

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390
to chemotherapy and today we postpone a
 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.950
to chemotherapy and today we postpone a
lot of deaths from cancer but we don't

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960
lot of deaths from cancer but we don't
 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.560
lot of deaths from cancer but we don't
finally prevent enough of them so that

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570
finally prevent enough of them so that
 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.270
finally prevent enough of them so that
if there was no cancer research 700,000

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280
if there was no cancer research 700,000
 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.530
if there was no cancer research 700,000
Americans of dying cancer area today

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:48.540
Americans of dying cancer area today
 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.220
Americans of dying cancer area today
600,000 a lot of them lid no more now

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230
600,000 a lot of them lid no more now
 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.160
600,000 a lot of them lid no more now
and that's good I'd like to move to a

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170
and that's good I'd like to move to a
 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.100
and that's good I'd like to move to a
situation where you know we only lose a

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110
situation where you know we only lose a
 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.060
situation where you know we only lose a
hundred thousand each it is we want it

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070
hundred thousand each it is we want it
 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.910
hundred thousand each it is we want it
enough I think a real chance we can move

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920
enough I think a real chance we can move
 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:12.080
enough I think a real chance we can move
to such a situation over the next decade

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090
 
 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.029
 
well up to now we've been focusing out

00:01:17.029 --> 00:01:17.039
well up to now we've been focusing out
 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:19.940
well up to now we've been focusing out
sort of the organized cell were called

the epithelial cell most human cancers
 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.289
the epithelial cell most human cancers
are tissues lining glands and their

don't you know pass through the membrane

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310
don't you know pass through the membrane
 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.449
don't you know pass through the membrane
cetera but then there are other cells in

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:40.309

progressed toward a mesenchymal form
 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.080
progressed toward a mesenchymal form
which up to now we've not very

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090
which up to now we've not very
 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.139
which up to now we've not very
successfully treated but I think we I

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149
successfully treated but I think we I
 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:04.760
successfully treated but I think we I
think there's the whole boards my hope

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770
think there's the whole boards my hope
 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.709
think there's the whole boards my hope
their words we know there are many

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719
their words we know there are many
 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.300
their words we know there are many
different forms of cancer to start with

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310
different forms of cancer to start with
 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.670
different forms of cancer to start with
you all progressed towards something

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680
 
 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.410
 
similar it says similar to a stem cell

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420
similar it says similar to a stem cell

differentiates themselves so that the if

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049
differentiates themselves so that the if
 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:31.580
differentiates themselves so that the if
you're killed by prostate cancer it may

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590
you're killed by prostate cancer it may
 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.890
you're killed by prostate cancer it may
be not that different than me you're

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900
be not that different than me you're
 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.710
be not that different than me you're
dying from lung cancer or melanoma that

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720
dying from lung cancer or melanoma that
 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.430

is this the bad cells have roughly the

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440
is this the bad cells have roughly the
 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.800
is this the bad cells have roughly the
same biochemistry underlying

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810
same biochemistry underlying
 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.890
same biochemistry underlying
biochemistry and so if we could kill one

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900
biochemistry and so if we could kill one
 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:55.610
biochemistry and so if we could kill one
of the sort of a sort of terminal stage

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620
of the sort of a sort of terminal stage
 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.789
of the sort of a sort of terminal stage
cancer we might be able to do all but

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799
cancer we might be able to do all but
 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:00.949
cancer we might be able to do all but
anyways that's my hope I know there are

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959
anyways that's my hope I know there are
 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.339
anyways that's my hope I know there are
a few other people think my way but the

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349
a few other people think my way but the
 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:10.610
a few other people think my way but the
slogan you get now is you all going to

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620
slogan you get now is you all going to
 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.159
slogan you get now is you all going to
be genetically different and we'll have

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:13.169
be genetically different and we'll have
 

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:19.670
be genetically different and we'll have
to use personalized therapy but before I

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680
to use personalized therapy but before I
 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.039
to use personalized therapy but before I
was treated I'd like my DNA to be looked

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049
was treated I'd like my DNA to be looked
 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.949
was treated I'd like my DNA to be looked
at but the best way to finally

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959
at but the best way to finally
 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.830
at but the best way to finally
sure we not to focus on the unique

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840
sure we not to focus on the unique
 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.990
sure we not to focus on the unique
features but features common to all

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000
features but features common to all
 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.840
features but features common to all
cancer cells
