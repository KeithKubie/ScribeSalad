ADRIAN ROSELLI: Hi.

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:03.270
I'm Adrian Roselli.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.960
You might have seen pictures
of me around the office.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.710
I'm sorry.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.420
I'm here to talk
about accessibility,

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.800
but I have two slides
dedicated to my ego.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.140
One of them says, look,
I've written some stuff.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.090
Good for me.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.660
Another one says that I work
with the HTML Working Group

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.630
from the W3C.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.400
I'm on the Accessibility
Task Force.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.670
I've been building
for the web since '94,

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.860
so almost since the
start of the web.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.240
I have a software development
company, Algonquin, which

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.540
I co-founded 18 years ago.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.210
I have a website, which
is crazy nowadays, right?

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.562
I have a website at
AdrianRoselli.com,

00:00:41.562 --> 00:00:46.470
and you can avoid-slash-follow
me on Twitter @aardrian.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.590
I think that's how
it's pronounced.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.930
You shouldn't have to say
your Twitter handle out loud.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:51.770
I know.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.480
So to dive right in, if you have
been on the internet, if you

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.250
have been using Twitter,
mailing lists, et cetera,

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.180
you might have seen a11y.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.930
a11y is a numeronym, and
it means accessibility.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.110
Essentially all it does it
takes the A first letter, the Y

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.039
last letter, replaces
all the letters

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:12.580
in between with a
number representing

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.020
the number of characters
that have been excised.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.180
So localization is l10n.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.000
Internationalization is i18n.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.870
This is really
popular on Twitter

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.140
because it's working in your
favor for character limits.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.502
It's also a great way with
the hashtag, the a11y hashtag,

00:01:30.502 --> 00:01:32.210
to see what people
are talking about that

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.251
is accessibility-related.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.711
I often talk about how
accessibility gets no respect.

00:01:39.711 --> 00:01:41.710
We'll be talking about
it in the software world,

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.950
but I'd like to point out
here in the day-to-day world.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.980
So we've been
redoing our office.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.330
That's not the furniture
we have right now,

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.950
but the furniture we have now
blocked too many of the colors.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.430
So we have these three colors
that we've been very fond of,

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.820
this gray, this
green, and this blue.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.450
The green is called Lime Ricky.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.210
The blue is called Online,
because that's a cool name.

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.890
And the gray of the ceiling
is called Cyberspace.

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.610
So Sherwin Williams
seemed to think

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.240
that these were a great set of
names for colors, so much so

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.750
that when it came time to choose
what they were going to name

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.250
the color of putty-- it's
like the '80s IBM desktop

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.110
computers-- Accessible Beige.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.910
So the concept of
accessibility getting

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.670
respect outside of
the software world,

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.870
yeah, it carries through
to paint colors as well.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.840
So sort of keep that
in the back your head.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.700
You might sort of run across
this trend in the real world

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.870
in other places as well.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.360
We are going to go
over some statistics.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.960
I'm going to pitch to you
the idea of being selfish.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.600
I'll go through some
techniques, basic tests

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.800
that you can run yourself.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.100
For those who are
technical, I'll

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.500
even talk a little bit about
ARIA and HTML best practices.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.670
If you're not technical,
we can breeze through that.

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.130
I am available for questions,
here and on the internet.

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.610
And then I'll have
some links at the end.

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.570
So to dive right
into the statistics,

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.660
not always super
exciting, but it's

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.870
good to know what these
numbers look like.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.600
In the United States in
the 21 to 64 age bracket,

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.480
we're looking at
a population of 10

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.860
and 1/2 percent that have
some form of a disability.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.660
As you hit the 65 to
74-year-old age group,

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.780
you're talking about a
quarter of the population.

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.360
When you get above 75, that's
half of the US population

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.010
has some form of disability.

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.370
These do include
visual disabilities,

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.870
visual impairments, hearing
impairments, mobility,

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.660
cognitive, and then the various
flavors of those as well.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.520
For vision impairments,
Americans from just under 2%

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.620
in the 21-64 age bracket up
to about 10% of the population

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.560
when you get 75 and up.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.330
Worldwide, we're talking
about 285 million people.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:57.730
39 million of those are blind.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.610
For hearing loss, in the 45
to 64-year-old age group,

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.049
almost 20% of the population
has some hearing loss.

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:11.590
When you get above 75 years old,
you're looking at about half

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.780
of the population, half
of the US population.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.190
Worldwide, 360 million people
have disabling hearing loss.

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.460
I gave a talk at Accessibility
Camp New York City

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.340
a couple weeks ago,
or a few weeks ago,

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.160
and there was a woman who said
my statistics are out of date.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.440
I haven't been able to
validate the new numbers.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.130
But she says that it's 360
million people worldwide.

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.560
It's closer to about
500 million people.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.550
So these numbers might
even be an underestimation.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.100
Mobility impairments-- 21
to 64-year-old age group

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.660
is almost 6%.

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.990
75 and up age group, a
third of the population

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.620
has some form of
mobility impairment.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.680
Cognitive impairments,
which can include things

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.210
like dyslexia,
dyscalculia, which

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.430
is sort of the numbers version
of dyslexia, memory issues,

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.680
ADD, ADHD, et cetera,
there's a pretty broad range.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.510
You're looking at 4.3% in
the younger age bracket,

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.460
up to 14+% in the
75-and-up age bracket.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.954
There's a trend
with these numbers

00:05:14.954 --> 00:05:16.370
that I think you've
probably seen,

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.840
is that that number tends to
increase as the age increases.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.510
So I've given you
the statistics,

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.660
and statistics really
don't sell people

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.520
on why they need to
support accessibility.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.080
Raw numbers are
just raw numbers.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.650
They don't always
get the point across.

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.910
So I'm going to preach to
you on how to be selfish

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.080
and how this can be good.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.540
Web Accessibility In Mind
has this wonderful hierarchy

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:42.770
for motivating accessibility
change within an organization.

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.350
At the bottom of
their pyramid, they

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:48.290
have guilt. You can guilt
people to support accessibility.

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:50.160
Then you can start
to punish them.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.890
You can make it a requirement.

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:55.150
You can work to reward
them, enlighten them,

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:56.910
and ultimately, you
want to inspire them.

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.493
You want people to feel inspired
so that they'll support users

00:05:59.493 --> 00:06:00.390
with disabilities.

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:01.640
I think this is a great model.

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.500
I think it falls short.

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.020
I think that we can modify this.

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.300
And the star on top of this
thing is to make it about me.

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.580
If you start to look at
it as how it affects you,

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:16.980
you might start to accidentally
support some disabilities.

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:20.080
So getting older-- as I was
doing the opening numbers,

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.914
you saw the numbers
of people who

00:06:21.914 --> 00:06:23.580
are affected with
different disabilities

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.120
tends to decline as people age.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.029
Getting older does
affect nearly everybody.

00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:30.320
There are some people who
might be fortunate enough not

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:30.862
to get older.

00:06:30.862 --> 00:06:33.195
Unless you're Superman, that
probably doesn't bode well.

00:06:33.195 --> 00:06:34.110
It means you're dead.

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:37.100
It does, as I say, carry
risks and side effects,

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.050
definitely not for the young.

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:42.165
In this image, there are two
couples sitting on the curb.

00:06:42.165 --> 00:06:43.790
They're basically
doing the same thing.

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:46.620
They might be debating
where to go for dinner.

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.850
They might be looking at
what they want to do next.

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:51.550
The only thing that's separating
them, besides about four feet,

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:54.020
is probably 40 years in age.

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.990
They're really the
same set of people,

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:59.920
same objectives, same goals.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.380
Here we have two
women on a bench.

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:02.344
They are both reading.

00:07:02.344 --> 00:07:04.260
They're separated by
about a foot and probably

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:05.840
another 40 years.

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:10.000
Also, one of them is our reading
off of a solar-powered device.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.280
The other one is not.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:12.730
That's hilarious.

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:14.200
Are people laughing
on the hangout?

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:14.700
No?

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:15.832
OK.

00:07:15.832 --> 00:07:19.510
[SIGHS] Tough internet crowd.

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:23.445
Accidents-- accidents
are a thing that happen.

00:07:23.445 --> 00:07:24.820
All of these listed
here are just

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:26.890
examples of what's
happened to me--

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:29.300
broken limbs, eye
injuries, hearing injuries,

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:33.160
head trauma-- big
fan of head trauma.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.442
An example of somebody who
has their wrist in a cast.

00:07:36.442 --> 00:07:38.150
When you don't have
access to that wrist,

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:40.441
it makes it a little bit hard
to type or use your mouse

00:07:40.441 --> 00:07:42.860
or do other
day-to-day activities.

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.410
This can happen to anybody.

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:46.950
You can have an
eye injury, which

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:49.970
means now you're limited in
peripheral vision and binocular

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:50.910
vision.

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:53.360
Some people might do it
strictly for fashion.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.180
That's a personal choice.

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:58.230
That is not me,
despite the hair.

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:01.030
Some people are sort of
predisposed to circumstances.

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:03.890
This is a scenario in
England where people chase

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:06.894
a wheel of cheese down a hill.

00:08:06.894 --> 00:08:08.810
They're chasing a wheel
of cheese down a hill.

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:10.340
At the bottom of
the hill, they have

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:12.630
ambulances waiting
to take people away

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:13.780
who've been injured.

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:15.380
This is a thing they do.

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:17.944
Assuming they don't have a
disability when they start,

00:08:17.944 --> 00:08:19.360
a lot of them do
when they finish.

00:08:21.829 --> 00:08:23.620
Now, you could believe
that you're like me.

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:26.610
You're invincible and
allergic to nothing.

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:28.760
But there are other things
that are factors here.

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.850
Lots of people
like to multitask.

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:33.450
People like to work in
the sun, eat at your desk.

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:35.450
Sometimes you don't
have headphones handy,

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:36.409
unless you're at
the airport and they

00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:37.390
have that vending
machine where they

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:39.047
charge $20 for the headphones.

00:08:39.047 --> 00:08:40.880
And then what are you
going to do with them?

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.370
They don't work half the time.

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:43.980
I guess that was
just me this morning.

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:47.240
Also, content isn't always
in your native language.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:51.420
So here is somebody trying
to work while eating lunch.

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:54.090
This describes my day-to-day
activity pretty much.

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:56.650
Eating at the keyboard
leaves me with one hand free.

00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:58.650
Become very comfortable
using a keyboard instead

00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:00.940
of a mouse in that scenario.

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:05.420
Somebody working in the sun--
I had to have a cat image,

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:06.710
so I put it in there.

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:08.360
So if you've worked
in the sun, you've

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.110
tried to use your
mobile phone in the sun,

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:13.640
you probably recognize you
can't see the screen very well.

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:18.060
You need to turn up the contrast
and/or turn up the brightness.

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:19.650
These guys are
among my favorites

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:23.950
because they are working in
the sun, they are distracted,

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:26.542
they are computing
with one hand.

00:09:26.542 --> 00:09:28.750
Frankly, I'm not even
convinced that they're working.

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:30.890
I think it is quite
likely that they are just

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:35.450
taking a very long lunch
and calling it a work day.

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:38.085
I want to be those guys.

00:09:38.085 --> 00:09:39.460
This guy, though,
is my favorite.

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:42.575
Here's somebody who's working
in a park on the bench, who

00:09:42.575 --> 00:09:45.031
has affixed papers to
himself to block the sun.

00:09:45.031 --> 00:09:47.030
And the best part is, if
you look really closely

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:50.400
on his lap, that's a typewriter.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.130
That guy is awesome.

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:54.920
Maybe Williamsburg
this was taken.

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:57.610
I don't know.

00:09:57.610 --> 00:10:00.170
Somebody working in a cafe--
he's got a video camera

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:01.460
on the counter next to him.

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:03.150
He's got his
headphones plugged in.

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:05.800
Probably he is doing
some video work.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.500
And if so, if he's
in a cafe, he's

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:10.490
not going to be able to hear
the audio from his video,

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:12.130
and he needs to plug
in his headphones

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:16.120
in order to do the work
that he's trying to do.

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:20.330
Somebody in bed with his
significant other, or pet,

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:22.360
matter of perspective.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:25.510
If like me, you've tried
to do any computing in bed,

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:27.670
you don't want to wake
up the person who's

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:29.829
with you, because that
doesn't always go well.

00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:32.120
And certainly the ability to
use headphones and control

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:36.060
brightness is very
important in that scenario.

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:38.650
This image is analogous
to where I live.

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:40.330
I don't live in
these apartments.

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:42.530
I live in a house, but on
either side of my house

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:44.240
is a motorcycle.

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.570
And one side is a
guy with a Harley,

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:48.770
and the other side is
a guy with a Honda,

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:52.350
and they like to see who can
out-motorcycle each other.

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:54.410
They like to rev their
engines, and their engines

00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:57.240
are always revving right during
a critical moment in whatever

00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:01.010
show I'm watching or
conversation or whatever.

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:03.130
So sometimes the
environmental factors

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:07.270
are outside your control,
even when you're at home.

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:09.990
This young woman is
in another country,

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:11.115
doesn't speak the language.

00:11:11.115 --> 00:11:14.330
She's trying to find information
about how to get home.

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:16.962
The keyboard is probably not
in her native language, either,

00:11:16.962 --> 00:11:18.420
which means the
keys are different.

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:19.470
The screen is different.

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:20.636
She's just not used to this.

00:11:20.636 --> 00:11:23.170
She's a completely
competent computer user,

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:25.160
but when you're
in a foreign land,

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.920
things just aren't
quite so easy to use.

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:32.300
Tech support is another
factor to consider.

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:34.580
If like me, every time you
go to your parents' house

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:36.580
for Thanksgiving, the
first thing you have to do

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:39.820
is get the printer working
again, fix the browser,

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:43.676
uninstall some malware,
and all those other things,

00:11:43.676 --> 00:11:45.800
that's a lot of time that
you spend on your holiday

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:48.130
when you could be eating
turkey and pie that you are

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:50.572
busy trying to help
get your parents up

00:11:50.572 --> 00:11:52.780
and running again so that
they don't have to call you

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:55.841
during the week in
the office to ask you

00:11:55.841 --> 00:11:58.215
what that big purple box is
in the corner of your browser

00:11:58.215 --> 00:12:02.030
that's blocking 800 trackers.

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:06.090
So the general message here is
that supporting accessibility

00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:10.210
now, today, is going
to help future you.

00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:12.950
Because you're all
going to get older.

00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:14.630
You're all going to get older.

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:17.070
Am I breaking the
fourth wall there?

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:17.990
OK.

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:19.260
Nobody's laughing.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:20.840
Laugh.

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:24.480
So it's going to help
serve future you.

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.840
Supporting accessibility
now also helps

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:30.114
the injured version of you and
the encumbered version of you.

00:12:30.114 --> 00:12:31.280
You don't have to be broken.

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:34.750
You could just be working
in the sun or on the train

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:35.790
or on a staircase.

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:38.630
I don't know why you would be.

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:41.920
If you get younger developers
to buy into this now,

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:44.960
it's helping future you.

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.530
Get that next generation
of developers to say,

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:49.430
yup, we see what
you're talking about.

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:50.550
Let's make that happen.

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:52.930
And as you age, and
ostensibly as you move away

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:54.860
from doing day-to-day
development

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:58.260
or being able to be involved in
software the same way you maybe

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.520
are now, you'll have a
whole generation behind you

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:06.320
who can make sure that you can
still do the things you do.

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:10.220
So accessibility is often
regarded as a checklist.

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:12.660
There are the Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines.

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:14.570
There are internal checklists.

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:17.630
There are different standards
that talk about the things that

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:18.630
you should or shouldn't.

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:21.214
Do but accessibility
is not a checklist.

00:13:21.214 --> 00:13:22.630
It's a good place
to start, but it

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:24.810
doesn't get you to the finish.

00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:27.610
This example I think is a
beautiful example of somebody

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:31.260
who has satisfied all
the checks on a list.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:32.700
They had a set of stairs.

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:33.990
They needed to have a ramp.

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:35.430
They probably had limited space.

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:37.640
They still needed
to have hand rails.

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:40.270
They satisfied everything
on the checklist.

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:42.500
The problem with
these stairs, though,

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:48.317
is if you aren't using a
wheelchair, step, step, trip,

00:13:48.317 --> 00:13:50.650
stumble, stumble, step, step,
step, step, trip, stumble,

00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:52.420
stumble, step, step.

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:55.640
If you're using these
stairs just as stairs,

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.770
that ramp cuts through
at an awkward angle,

00:13:57.770 --> 00:14:01.100
and people are always
tripping on them, OK?

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:03.870
If you're using these
stairs in a wheelchair,

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:05.131
the angles are all wrong.

00:14:05.131 --> 00:14:07.130
Not only do you have to
make a really tight turn

00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:11.460
at each platform, but
the slope is too great.

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:14.500
The average wheelchair user
can't navigate that easily.

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.790
So those turns that you see,
each little platform, ends

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:20.100
in a stone wall, except
for the last one, where

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:23.240
it ends in a hilarious
staircase fall in case

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:24.900
you get going too fast.

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:26.020
That's unusable.

00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:28.721
It's actually dangerous for
somebody in a wheelchair.

00:14:28.721 --> 00:14:30.470
And it's moderately
dangerous for somebody

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:32.060
who's not in a wheelchair.

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:33.890
But they satisfied a checklist.

00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:34.840
So good for them.

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:35.970
They did that.

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:38.260
Accessibility is
an ongoing process.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.660
You can't just do the
checklist and call it done.

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:43.170
You need to pay attention
that things change.

00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:44.370
Situations change.

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:45.740
Technologies change.

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:49.230
Assistive technology changes.

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:53.150
This is a drugstore that did
a great job putting a ramp in.

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:56.685
But what they failed to
do is clear the snow off.

00:14:56.685 --> 00:14:58.060
And when they did
that, then they

00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:00.980
put potted plants on the ramp.

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:04.217
So yeah, we put the ramp up
there, and we did it right,

00:15:04.217 --> 00:15:06.300
and the angles are right
and everything's perfect.

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:07.820
But now that winter
has come, we've

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:11.680
made it completely unusable--
completely unusable.

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:14.540
So this is an ongoing process.

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:18.199
This is something that you have
to constantly stay on top of.

00:15:18.199 --> 00:15:19.990
So I'm going to talk
about some techniques.

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:22.120
Some of you might have
worked with user stories.

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:24.950
Has anybody in the room worked
with user stories before?

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:26.100
OK, good.

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:29.360
I'll spend a little bit of
time on this, not too much.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.715
If you're unfamiliar with
them, the idea of a user story

00:15:31.715 --> 00:15:35.250
is you talk about a user, the
outcome that that user wants,

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:36.780
and the value of that outcome.

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:38.820
When you're writing
them out, As user,

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:41.610
I want outcome so that value.

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:44.550
There are some variations
on how you write that.

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:47.350
So I have some
selfish user stories.

00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:49.420
As a user, I was
on a sunlit patio.

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:52.990
I want to be able to read the
content and see the controls.

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:54.520
Maybe I'm looking something up.

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.740
Maybe I'm actually doing my job.

00:15:56.740 --> 00:16:01.260
If the sun's shining, I still
want to be able to do my job.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.430
As a user in bed with
a sleeping spouse,

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:06.860
I want to watch a training
video in silence so that I

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:08.820
can get caught up at work.

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:11.650
I'm sure many of us have spent
some time trying to get caught

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:13.260
up at work on our own time.

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.010
And in bed is kind of
a nice way to do it.

00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:17.150
That way if you fall asleep,
you're already there.

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:21.000
It's easy, other than
drooling on the keyboard.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.370
In order to click links, as a
user was no elbow room in coach

00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:26.610
class with the tiny
track pad, I want

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:31.010
click areas to be large
enough and adequately spaced.

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:33.460
I'm sure all of you
have been on a flight.

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:35.140
I'm sure some of you
have tried to use

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:36.410
your computer on a flight.

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:38.290
And you know your
elbows have to stick

00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:40.440
to your pelvis to do anything.

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:42.900
And suddenly you have
a mobility impairment.

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:47.610
It becomes very difficult
to mouse around on a page.

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:49.740
As a user distracted
by the TV, I

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:54.210
want clear headings and labels
so that I don't lose my place.

00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:57.710
I like to watch television
while I'm filling out tax forms.

00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:58.720
Call me crazy.

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.410
And I want to know
what my progress is.

00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:01.760
I want to know what
those fields are.

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:03.468
Sometimes when it's
a placeholder instead

00:17:03.468 --> 00:17:05.599
of a label on the field,
once I type in there

00:17:05.599 --> 00:17:07.079
I have no idea what
I just entered,

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:09.079
and I have to go back and
delete and start over.

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:15.510
So I've broken them down
for some different types

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:18.849
of disabilities for
physical impairments.

00:17:18.849 --> 00:17:20.510
As a keyboard-only
user, I want to be

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:22.569
able to use the
entire application.

00:17:22.569 --> 00:17:24.819
I want to navigate a product
list with the Tab key

00:17:24.819 --> 00:17:27.099
so I can find the right option.

00:17:27.099 --> 00:17:29.510
In order to click links as
a limited-mobility user,

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:32.700
I want click areas to be large
enough and adequately spaced.

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:35.430
Because when you hit the wrong
one and you have to go back,

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:36.820
that's time.

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:39.390
That's time and frustration.

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:42.020
Visual impairment--
as a color blind user,

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:46.320
I want to be able to see the
links in the page content.

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:48.480
As a low vision user,
I want to zoom the page

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:51.120
so that I can read the content.

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:53.060
In order to use the
site as a blind user,

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:55.810
I want to use a screen
reader to navigate.

00:17:55.810 --> 00:17:59.140
That's a form of
assistive technology.

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:02.460
Hearing impairment--
as a low hearing user,

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:05.570
I want to be able to
access transcripts.

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:07.700
I want access to
closed captions so

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:10.930
that I can use training videos
or just watch the Star Wars

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:11.430
trailer.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.220
It's a timely reference.

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:16.342
OK.

00:18:16.342 --> 00:18:18.580
It's timely.

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:21.090
In order to participate in
a webinar as a deaf user,

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:23.510
I wanted real-time
captioning or transcripts.

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:26.070
This is really key
at conferences,

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:28.230
and some of the better
conferences are doing that.

00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:29.890
While the speaker is
up there, somebody

00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:33.420
is live transcribing
it, and it's awesome.

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:36.130
And you also see how often
you say the word "um."

00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:38.950
So it's a little bit humbling.

00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:43.930
Cognitive impairment-- as a user
with a vestibular disorder--

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:47.930
that is an off-kilter
balance, essentially-- I

00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:51.290
want to be able to disable
parallax scrolling,

00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:56.920
because that can cause
disorientation and nausea.

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:59.210
As a user with
dyscalculia-- that's

00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:02.950
the number transposition-- I
want distinct number fields

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:04.950
for each block of digits
in a credit card number

00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:07.120
so that I can
purchase a product.

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:09.860
One long field where you
enter all 12 to 16 digits

00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:11.880
can be very confusing.

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:14.950
Breaking them up can be useful.

00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:18.290
In order to not get confused on
pages with long text passages,

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:21.610
as a user with dyslexia I
want control over text size,

00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:24.520
spacing, and/or
alignment, essentially

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:27.880
allowing me to shape the content
to a way that's easy for me

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:28.380
to read.

00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:34.370
I was tempted to put
personas in here,

00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:37.070
but Sarah Horton and
Whitney Quesenbery

00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:41.820
have done a great job on putting
together personas already.

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:45.840
And you should go steal them,
because they're pre-written,

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:47.640
and they're good to go.

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:49.974
One thing I would
like to note, though,

00:19:49.974 --> 00:19:52.390
having worked with personas
before, I know from experience

00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:55.750
that personas are sometimes the
first thing that will get cut.

00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:57.710
You want to get
down to n personas,

00:19:57.710 --> 00:20:00.020
often that number is
maybe four or five.

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:02.222
And once you start
folding in personas

00:20:02.222 --> 00:20:04.180
that are dedicated to
people with disabilities,

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:06.950
those are often the
first ones to get cut.

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:12.230
So what I do is I fold
in some variations.

00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:15.460
I take a regular persona,
and I add some things to it

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:20.260
from these selfish
approaches that help.

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:23.550
So if I'm a persona, I work
when I should be relaxing,

00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:25.270
and I relax when I
should be working.

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:28.270
I have a reverse day, because
I'm weird, or I'm a slacker.

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:29.840
I'm not sure which.

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:31.450
I live between
motorcycles, which

00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:34.140
means I've always
got audio issues,

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:36.400
always got a hearing impairment.

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:39.910
I work late at night with the
TV on, so I'm always distracted.

00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:41.680
I use the subtitles in Netflix.

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:43.720
I'm always relying on
the closed captioning.

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:46.090
I'm heavily reliant on that.

00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:48.740
I also keep all screens
as dark as possible,

00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:50.844
partly because I want
to save my battery,

00:20:50.844 --> 00:20:53.010
and partly because I don't
want to scorch my retinas

00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:54.680
in the middle of the night.

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:57.340
So these are all
scenarios where you

00:20:57.340 --> 00:21:00.230
can fold these into a persona.

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:05.710
And just as I had run through
some sample user stories,

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:09.950
you can quietly fold these in
without necessarily giving up

00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:11.830
that that's what
you're trying to do.

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:14.250
You can sneak them in.

00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:16.260
So this one is one
of my favorites,

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:20.290
the click links as a user with
no elbow room in coach class.

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:22.570
People are going to say this
is important for the CEO.

00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:23.880
We need the CEO
to like this piece

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:25.139
of software, this application.

00:21:25.139 --> 00:21:26.680
Then you start to
ask some questions.

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:30.660
Does the CEO work on the train
or on a plane or in a boat

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:31.950
by a moat?

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:33.780
These are all factors
that you can use

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:35.160
to fold into your user stories.

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:38.270
Listen, this is something
that he'll encounter.

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:39.750
We're now supporting the CEO.

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:42.060
We are now doing that
thing that you want.

00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:44.012
We're making it work for him.

00:21:44.012 --> 00:21:45.720
Nobody needs to know
that you're actually

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:48.920
sneaking in some
accessibility best practices,

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:52.550
just like nobody needs to know
is that they map to real user

00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:56.070
stories or that you're
folding some of these ideas

00:21:56.070 --> 00:22:00.580
into personas that otherwise
might be completely discarded.

00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:02.670
So you can sort
of stealthily fold

00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:04.300
some of this stuff
in there, and people

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:06.645
don't need to know about it.

00:22:06.645 --> 00:22:09.570
We're going to run
through some basic tests.

00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:11.600
These are tests
that anybody can do.

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:16.540
If you have a web browser,
you can do the tests.

00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:19.390
It's really that simple.

00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:21.300
Click on the field labels.

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:23.190
When you're on a form,
it's the quickest way

00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:26.640
to see if the field label
is associated with the form

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:27.510
control.

00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:30.389
Usually it's the label element.

00:22:30.389 --> 00:22:32.430
So when you click it, does
the field get focused?

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:35.870
Does the radio button or
checkbox get selected?

00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:38.810
So in this example from
Buffalo Soccer Club,

00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:40.389
an inner-city youth
soccer program

00:22:40.389 --> 00:22:42.180
we started up at
Algonquin a few years ago,

00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:45.569
and which we're very proud
of and which you are now

00:22:45.569 --> 00:22:47.360
going to see as my
example throughout these

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:49.960
slides because it's awesome.

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:52.610
The contact form, if I
click on Name-- boom--

00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:55.840
it puts focus in that
field, ready to go.

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:57.890
That means that those two
fields are correlated.

00:22:57.890 --> 00:22:59.598
That means that
assistive technology will

00:22:59.598 --> 00:23:01.790
be able to draw a
connection between them,

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:05.110
and the user will know
specifically what field

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:07.660
he or she is filling out.

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:09.590
Unplug your mouse.

00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:13.680
My variation on this is to
unplug somebody else's mouse.

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:15.850
Because that's hilarious,
unless it's your boss.

00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:17.290
Then it's not
quite so hilarious.

00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:20.000
And then you have to
apologize, return it.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.330
So turn off the track pad.

00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:23.900
Turn off all those
pointing devices.

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:27.240
And see if you can still
use the entire application,

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:29.710
if you can use the entire page.

00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:31.157
Can you tell which
item has focus

00:23:31.157 --> 00:23:32.240
if you're tabbing through?

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:35.340
Do you know at a glance
where is the cursor,

00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:36.800
where is it right now?

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:38.300
And does it match
your expectations?

00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:40.240
If you start to tab
through the page

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:43.710
and it goes, field
1, field 2, field 14,

00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:45.200
you've got a bit of a problem.

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:48.910
And you'll need to take a
look at what's causing that.

00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:50.560
In this example,
I show that I've

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:52.990
started to tab through the
navigation of the site,

00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:56.110
and I have the arrow pointing
at the sub-navigation that

00:23:56.110 --> 00:23:57.840
has focus.

00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:59.940
It follows the same
styles as the hover,

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:02.720
and it also has the outline,
the browser's default caret

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:06.560
to show me, yup, that's
where I am right now.

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:08.790
Turn off images.

00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:11.557
Images aren't necessarily always
going to load anyway, but just

00:24:11.557 --> 00:24:12.140
turn them off.

00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:13.410
Let's see what happens.

00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:15.170
Remember users can
have bad connections.

00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:17.184
The images can be messed up.

00:24:17.184 --> 00:24:18.850
If you can still make
sense of the page,

00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:19.891
you're doing pretty well.

00:24:19.891 --> 00:24:22.850
If content is missing,
you've got a problem.

00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:24.950
If you can't use
the site at all,

00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:26.620
you've got an even
bigger problem.

00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:29.130
It also lets you see if the
alternative text you've put

00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:31.430
behind those images is useful.

00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:33.390
So here's the same page.

00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:35.000
I turn off the images.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.340
The page is still usable.

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:40.370
Some things to note-- up in
the corner, upper left corner

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:43.501
where the logo was, it
says Buffalo Soccer Club.

00:24:43.501 --> 00:24:44.000
That's fine.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.249
That's great alternative text.

00:24:45.249 --> 00:24:47.040
That's exactly what it is.

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:50.350
The big picture where the
kid was standing-- nothing.

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:50.990
It's blank.

00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:52.700
There's no alternative text.

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:56.370
And that's OK, because that
image is purely decorative.

00:24:56.370 --> 00:24:58.140
Its presence there
doesn't add anything

00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:00.230
to the value of
the content, and I

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:02.640
don't want to take somebody
on your screen reader

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:06.110
and have them listen to this
long description of kid happily

00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:07.924
running after a
soccer ball, and right

00:25:07.924 --> 00:25:09.590
after I took this
picture, he fell down,

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:11.506
and we all laughed, and
then we felt terrible,

00:25:11.506 --> 00:25:13.690
and we apologized for an hour.

00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:15.510
Because that's unnecessary.

00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:17.450
You might also
note that there are

00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:23.040
icons in the navigation across
the top and on the left side.

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:23.780
Those go away.

00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:24.870
They don't add anything.

00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:27.160
They're not necessary
to understand.

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:29.670
You will, however, notice
that the social media

00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:31.950
icons aren't showing alt text.

00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:34.140
There is alt text behind them.

00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:36.140
You can see that pretty
quickly if you just view

00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:37.741
the page or cursor over it.

00:25:37.741 --> 00:25:38.740
There is alt text there.

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:41.031
The browser just does not
expand the space of the image

00:25:41.031 --> 00:25:43.360
to display the alt
text, and since my goal

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:49.350
is for users of assistive
technology, that's OK.

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:51.400
Turn on high contrast mode.

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:55.550
If you have a Windows machine,
left Alt key, left Shift key,

00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:59.710
and Print Screen drops your
rate and a high contrast mode.

00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:03.040
And what that will do is
totally swap out your background

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:03.780
images.

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:05.180
It removes the
background images,

00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:06.900
and it also replaces
all the colors

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:09.570
throughout all of your
stylesheets-- text colors,

00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:12.200
the background
colors, et cetera.

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:16.510
So here's that same
page, ready to go.

00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:18.310
There it is Windows
high contrast mode.

00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:21.360
Background images have
gone away-- not a problem.

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:23.920
I know this because I also
tested it without images.

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:27.010
But also, everything
is still legible.

00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:28.780
It's still a usable site.

00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:32.970
So not high contrast
mode, high contrast mode,

00:26:32.970 --> 00:26:34.589
it should still work.

00:26:34.589 --> 00:26:36.630
There are media queries,
which I touch on later--

00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:38.920
there are media queries
that allow you to detect

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:40.700
high contrast mode
in Windows, and you

00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:44.160
can use those to do other things
as well, maybe scale text,

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.160
maybe do something else.

00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:49.850
But I wouldn't do that
without first testing.

00:26:49.850 --> 00:26:51.860
Turn off your style sheets.

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:54.110
This can be very eye-opening.

00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:56.450
If important content or
functionality disappear,

00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:58.630
as you need to consider
if that's good or bad.

00:26:58.630 --> 00:27:01.080
It isn't necessarily
bad, but you

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:02.900
need to understand the impact.

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:05.620
If the error messages
are useless now

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:07.940
and you can't find them,
you've got an issue there.

00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:10.190
Remember a style sheet can
be chunked on the download,

00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:12.740
and that can be a problem.

00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:15.169
If the content is still
in a reasonable order,

00:27:15.169 --> 00:27:15.960
you're pretty good.

00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:21.690
You want to check to see
if any styles are still

00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:25.040
in place-- text effects,
colors, things like that.

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:28.670
That suggests that there
is some inline style

00:27:28.670 --> 00:27:30.110
in your code, which
may or may not

00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:33.880
be good, depending on what the
page is supposed to be doing.

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:37.480
I look for that, and I usually
flag that as a potential error.

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:40.760
So that soccer club page
with the CSS turned off,

00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:42.860
I've scrolled down past
the navigation, which

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:44.610
is just a nested bullet list.

00:27:44.610 --> 00:27:46.580
But otherwise, the
page just flows--

00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:50.870
breadcrumb, h1, content,
picture of a kid--

00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:52.150
pretty straightforward.

00:27:52.150 --> 00:27:54.940
We're not losing anything there.

00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:58.784
Test for color blindness
and color contrast.

00:27:58.784 --> 00:28:00.200
Make sure there's
enough contrast.

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:01.574
This doesn't just
help the people

00:28:01.574 --> 00:28:03.800
who are using the
screens in sunlight,

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:06.370
but it helps
potentially everybody.

00:28:06.370 --> 00:28:08.640
Are the hyperlinks and
menus still visible?

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:11.230
If they aren't, you do
have a problem there.

00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:14.170
I have some links in here
for some different contrast

00:28:14.170 --> 00:28:14.830
checkers.

00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:17.157
There are many, many
of them on the web.

00:28:17.157 --> 00:28:18.490
Some are built into the browser.

00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:20.402
Some are some add-ons.

00:28:20.402 --> 00:28:22.110
These slides will be
available afterwards

00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:26.110
so you can follow those
links at your leisure.

00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:30.450
This is the same page as
viewed if you had protanopia,

00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:34.310
deuteranopia, and tritanopia.

00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:38.570
These project a
little differently

00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:40.170
than they appear onscreen.

00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:42.320
But onscreen, it's still usable.

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:43.420
It's still legible.

00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:44.716
The colors still make sense.

00:28:44.716 --> 00:28:45.840
You're not losing anything.

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:50.290
Look for captions
and transcripts.

00:28:50.290 --> 00:28:53.490
If you have videos, if
you have audio files,

00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:56.050
check to see if there
are audio descriptions.

00:28:56.050 --> 00:28:58.630
Look to see if there are
links to those transcripts

00:28:58.630 --> 00:28:59.880
and those captions.

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:01.300
You want them to
be easy to find.

00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:03.550
You still build them into
whatever the player is,

00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:05.612
but in case that player
doesn't support it

00:29:05.612 --> 00:29:07.070
or the assistive
technology doesn't

00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:09.250
support the player's
way of supporting it,

00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:10.720
keep plain text links.

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:12.180
It's great.

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:13.930
Text alternatives
are a good way to go.

00:29:13.930 --> 00:29:16.669
I have some tutorials
here as well.

00:29:16.669 --> 00:29:18.210
I have a YouTube
captioning tutorial.

00:29:18.210 --> 00:29:19.835
I think you guys have
heard of YouTube.

00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:26.230
There is a great video, "The
Lady Vanishes," on YouTube,

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:29.910
which is the entire movie
that has closed captions

00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:32.080
and audio descriptions.

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:33.590
You can watch the entire movie.

00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:34.180
It's great.

00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:36.010
And I think it's
in Spanish as well.

00:29:36.010 --> 00:29:37.760
So watch it, and you'll
get a good example

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:41.830
of how these can be effective
and how they can be useful.

00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:44.345
And for giggles, just
put mute on your computer

00:29:44.345 --> 00:29:47.430
or your headphones.

00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:50.140
Hyperlinks-- hyperlinks
are sort of the thing that

00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:52.650
make the web what the web is.

00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:55.260
If you have a click
here, more, link to,

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:56.300
consider changing those.

00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:57.924
Let those be descriptive,
what the user

00:29:57.924 --> 00:30:00.540
is going to actually
end up going to visit.

00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:02.470
Assistive technology
allows you to navigate

00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:03.480
through all the links,
and they're just

00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:06.021
going to hear click here, click
here, click here, click here,

00:30:06.021 --> 00:30:09.030
click here, click
here-- not very useful.

00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:13.060
If you're using all caps
or a full URL or emoticons,

00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:15.270
remember that might
be pronounced in a way

00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:18.320
that you don't expect, maybe
spelled out letter by letter.

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:21.190
A URL spelled out letter by
letter is painful to listen to,

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:22.090
by the way.

00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:23.500
I recommend you try it sometime.

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:26.010
It's awful.

00:30:26.010 --> 00:30:28.700
Are you warning the user
before opening new windows?

00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:30.860
This is critical
for managing focus

00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:35.600
for users who are using either
assistive technology or not,

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:38.510
who just have trouble managing
the multiple interfaces.

00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:41.610
At least give them a heads-up
that's going to happen.

00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:43.833
Do links to downloads
provide helpful info?

00:30:43.833 --> 00:30:47.664
Are you telling them this
is a PDF and it's 35 meg?

00:30:47.664 --> 00:30:49.330
They can choose to
download it, but it's

00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:51.430
better than surprising them.

00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:53.620
Are you using pagination links?

00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:57.910
If it's a blog, for example,
can they jump ahead a few pages?

00:30:57.910 --> 00:30:59.050
Can they jump back?

00:30:59.050 --> 00:31:02.000
Is this something they
have the freedom to do?

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.590
Are your links obvious?

00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:06.250
I always recommend
underlining them.

00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:08.290
But make sure that
they're are obvious.

00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:11.400
Make sure that there is alt
text for any image links.

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:14.020
Just because the image means
one thing in one context,

00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:16.250
if you make it a
link, it probably

00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:20.410
should have its alt text
updated to reflect that.

00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:22.430
And is the link text consistent?

00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:26.711
If you're pointing to the same
35-megabyte PDF annual report,

00:31:26.711 --> 00:31:28.210
maybe every time
you link to it, you

00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:31.066
should say Annual
Report 35 meg PDF.

00:31:31.066 --> 00:31:32.440
That way they
don't think they're

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:34.106
getting a different
document every time,

00:31:34.106 --> 00:31:38.300
and they're not downloading
it over and over and over.

00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:39.550
How much time do I have again?

00:31:39.550 --> 00:31:41.120
WOMAN: You've got until 3:00.

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:42.402
ADRIAN ROSELLI: Until 3:00?

00:31:42.402 --> 00:31:44.360
[SIGHS] We're going to
go over by like an hour.

00:31:47.390 --> 00:31:48.280
It's so weird.

00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:50.240
There's an all-seeing
eye right there.

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:51.480
It's so uncomfortable.

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:53.700
Hi.

00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:57.300
I'm going to jump into
some technical bits here.

00:31:57.300 --> 00:31:59.650
The nice thing is this
is the last section.

00:31:59.650 --> 00:32:02.620
So that's awesome.

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:07.160
If you don't know what ARIA is,
Web Accessibility Initiative--

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:10.320
Accessible Rich
Internet Applications.

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:14.500
ARIA adds accessibility
information to HTML elements

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:17.449
and to elements that
aren't necessarily HTML.

00:32:17.449 --> 00:32:19.240
It can be sued with
prior versions of HTML.

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:23.480
So if you, like me, are rocking
some HTML 3.2 page somewhere,

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:24.470
go nuts.

00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:26.120
Just be prepared to
throw some ARIA on

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:27.960
there so that it can
be useful for people

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:30.130
with assistive technology.

00:32:30.130 --> 00:32:34.970
The 1.0 specification was
published in March of 2014,

00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:38.120
but it had been in use and
been supported for a long time

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:39.010
before that.

00:32:39.010 --> 00:32:41.320
So this technology
has got great support

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:43.690
and has been out
there for a while.

00:32:43.690 --> 00:32:45.850
There are five
rules of using ARIA.

00:32:45.850 --> 00:32:48.360
They're pretty straightforward,
which is awesome.

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:49.960
And they're simple.

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:53.090
The first is if you can use
a native HTML5 element that

00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:58.810
has the semantics or behavior
that you want built in, do it.

00:32:58.810 --> 00:33:00.460
Just use it.

00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:00.960
Good to go.

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:02.334
You don't need to
worry about it.

00:33:02.334 --> 00:33:03.070
You want an h1?

00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:03.820
Great.

00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:05.260
You want a header tag?

00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:05.760
Great.

00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:07.150
A footer tag?

00:33:07.150 --> 00:33:07.850
Awesome.

00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:08.980
You're off to the races.

00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:10.480
You probably don't
need to use ARIA.

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:13.200
You're doing a good job with it.

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:15.240
Do not change native semantics.

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:18.290
That h1, if you want
people to click on it,

00:33:18.290 --> 00:33:20.720
don't put a role
of "button" on it.

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:23.610
Once you start changing
those semantics,

00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:27.700
assistive technology doesn't
know what to do in every case.

00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:31.110
It's not going to bind
that to keys, for example.

00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:32.700
Leave your h1 as
an one as an h1.

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:36.330
Put a button in there if
you really want a button.

00:33:36.330 --> 00:33:38.390
All interactive
ARIA controls must

00:33:38.390 --> 00:33:41.110
be usable with the keyboard.

00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:43.590
So if you want
somebody to click,

00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:46.290
let them also use the Tab
key to get to it and Space

00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:48.270
or Enter an order
to activate it.

00:33:48.270 --> 00:33:49.930
If there's a drag
and drop, you need

00:33:49.930 --> 00:33:54.670
to figure out a way to make that
work with the keyboard only.

00:33:54.670 --> 00:33:57.960
Do not use role "presentation"
or ARIA-hidden "true"

00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:59.880
on any element that gets focus.

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:02.670
By focus, I mean
tabbing through the page

00:34:02.670 --> 00:34:04.940
until it gets that
outline, that caret.

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:09.330
If you do that, users
won't be able to focus it.

00:34:09.330 --> 00:34:10.870
I can't tab to
that element once I

00:34:10.870 --> 00:34:14.699
put hidden "true" or ARIA-hidden
"true" or role "presentation."

00:34:14.699 --> 00:34:19.060
It just isn't available
in my tabbing order.

00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:22.435
All interactive elements
must have an accessible name.

00:34:22.435 --> 00:34:24.060
Typically if you have
a button element,

00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:26.000
it's the text inside the button.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.900
That's pretty easy to do.

00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:31.100
Alt text on an
image, for example,

00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:32.690
that is the accessible name.

00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:34.230
There is a relatively
complex way

00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:36.469
of doing the accessible
name calculation.

00:34:36.469 --> 00:34:38.760
I'm not going to stress you
out with that, because it's

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:40.830
very easy to just fire
up some technology

00:34:40.830 --> 00:34:43.030
and check to see what
it's speaking to you,

00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:46.719
and then you'll know if
you're doing the right one.

00:34:46.719 --> 00:34:51.590
So here's an example of
something not to do with ARIA.

00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:53.989
So some people like to
take divs and make them

00:34:53.989 --> 00:34:55.800
into buttons or links.

00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:59.572
So they put an onclick
handler on a div.

00:34:59.572 --> 00:35:01.280
Well, they do that,
and then they quickly

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:03.970
find out that, well, they
can't use it with the keyboard.

00:35:03.970 --> 00:35:06.040
So they add a tab
index of zero to it.

00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:09.380
OK, now I can at least get
there with the keyboard.

00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:11.470
But when I hit the Enter
key, nothing happens.

00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:13.940
So I have to put an onkeypress.

00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:16.190
OK, so I put the onclick.

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:17.140
I put the onkey press.

00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:19.050
I can tab to it.

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:21.830
By the way, I'm excluding the
key codes and other things.

00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:23.320
I'm keeping this short.

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:25.340
Key codes are at the
bottom if you really

00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:28.090
want to check my math.

00:35:28.090 --> 00:35:31.050
But the thing is still
not completely useful,

00:35:31.050 --> 00:35:33.220
because it doesn't get
the native features

00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:34.480
from the browser.

00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:36.730
So now you put a
role "button" on it.

00:35:36.730 --> 00:35:39.430
So now you can do all
the things with this div

00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:42.650
that you could do with
the button element.

00:35:42.650 --> 00:35:45.507
Or you could use a button.

00:35:45.507 --> 00:35:46.590
I mean, it is that simple.

00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:48.320
The element already exists.

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:51.010
In most cases when you're
trying to repurpose an element,

00:35:51.010 --> 00:35:53.290
there's already an element
that will do it for you.

00:35:53.290 --> 00:35:55.710
There's already some ARIA
that will help you there.

00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:57.310
This is just standard HTML.

00:35:57.310 --> 00:35:58.370
There's no ARIA in there.

00:35:58.370 --> 00:36:00.160
And that's probably
the best use of ARIA

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:03.950
is not using it because
you don't need it.

00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:06.300
There are some things to note.

00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:08.700
ARIA can be overused.

00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:10.790
There are cases where
people have said, oh, well,

00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:11.289
don't worry.

00:36:11.289 --> 00:36:14.090
We'll just sprinkle some
ARIA on it, and it will work.

00:36:14.090 --> 00:36:17.215
And I link to two articles,
one by Jared Smith from WebAIM,

00:36:17.215 --> 00:36:19.910
"Accessibility Lipstick
on a Usability Pig."

00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:21.250
It's a great read.

00:36:21.250 --> 00:36:24.320
Marco Zehe also has "What
is WAI-ARIA, what does

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:25.810
it do for me, and whatnot?"

00:36:25.810 --> 00:36:28.150
And those are both
cautionary tales

00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:30.370
of how you can
overuse it and create

00:36:30.370 --> 00:36:34.960
very much the opposite
effect that you're going for.

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:37.870
HTML5 has these
beautiful elements

00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:40.640
built in that have
accessibility already

00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:43.740
there built into it by default.
It's just what it does.

00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:47.120
Header, nav, main, use
one per page, please.

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:50.352
A side footer, form,
it's already there.

00:36:50.352 --> 00:36:51.560
The browser knows what to do.

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:53.580
It can through these landmarks.

00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:56.020
It can navigate into
different sections of them.

00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:58.810
They map to ARIA
landmark roles already.

00:36:58.810 --> 00:37:00.470
Header has a role of "banner."

00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:03.419
Main has a role of "main."

00:37:03.419 --> 00:37:04.460
They're already built in.

00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:06.293
So you don't need to
add the roles on there.

00:37:06.293 --> 00:37:08.210
And the browsers support
it reasonably well.

00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:12.120
So if I do a generic
desktop layout,

00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:14.720
there they all are, the footer,
the header, the main, the nav.

00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:16.750
They're there.

00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:19.770
If you were to view
it mobile-- and I

00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:21.710
say mobile because
in responsive design,

00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:23.085
it usually just
means linearizing

00:37:23.085 --> 00:37:24.580
for a narrow screen.

00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:27.220
Same stuff, just use
the right elements.

00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:29.140
They've already got
the stuff built in.

00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:31.180
You don't need to
rely on the roles.

00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:34.247
ARIA isn't needed, because
it's already there.

00:37:34.247 --> 00:37:35.080
Leave the roles out.

00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:37.350
You're good to go.

00:37:37.350 --> 00:37:41.430
HTML5 headings-- a lot of people
will navigate by headings.

00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:42.240
Go in order.

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:44.240
Don't skip around.

00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:47.340
h1, h2, h3, step
back out of it OK.

00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:49.590
Don't go h1, h2, h4.

00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:53.080
You're creating some confusion
for a user at that point.

00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:55.610
There is no document
outline algorithm.

00:37:55.610 --> 00:37:57.640
It's mentioned in
the specification,

00:37:57.640 --> 00:37:59.570
but no browser supports it.

00:37:59.570 --> 00:38:02.750
So if anybody's telling you
that the document outline

00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:04.950
algorithm is something
that needs to be supported,

00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:07.590
which is every time you do a
section you put an h1 in it,

00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:09.450
for example, ignore that.

00:38:09.450 --> 00:38:11.740
Just follow good
heading structure.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:19.120
Section and article are often
misused as generic containers,

00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:20.250
and they are not.

00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:22.790
Those can overwhelm users
of assistive technology,

00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:25.796
because they're just
thrown all over the page.

00:38:25.796 --> 00:38:27.170
My rule of thumb
is unless you're

00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:29.610
going to put a heading
in there in h1 through 6,

00:38:29.610 --> 00:38:30.820
then don't make it a section.

00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:31.986
Don't make an article there.

00:38:31.986 --> 00:38:33.200
It's unnecessary.

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:35.410
If you need a
container for styling,

00:38:35.410 --> 00:38:37.280
use a div-- no big deal.

00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:45.190
Virgin America website has been
hailed as a really good design.

00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:48.470
There is no indicator anywhere
on the page where I am.

00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:50.230
As I tab through
this page, I have

00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:53.060
no sense of what's
going on, of where I am.

00:38:53.060 --> 00:39:00.000
It's a simple, simple fix
and an absurd oversight.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.540
You need to have
the focus styles.

00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:04.370
Keyboard users can't use
your site or your software

00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:06.414
without them.

00:39:06.414 --> 00:39:07.830
If you already
have a hover style,

00:39:07.830 --> 00:39:10.230
a colon hover,
put a colon focus.

00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:12.620
Match the selector, put focus.

00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:14.850
If you are using
libraries, see if they

00:39:14.850 --> 00:39:16.650
have focus styles in them.

00:39:16.650 --> 00:39:21.230
And if they do, look for the
outline none and remove it.

00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:24.040
You'd be amazed at how
removing that one line of CSS

00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:26.960
makes a whole lot of
sites and applications

00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:28.300
suddenly conformant.

00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:30.890
Suddenly they're usable
again just by removing that.

00:39:33.722 --> 00:39:34.680
See, we're almost done.

00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:36.710
This is actually perfect.

00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:40.640
Alternative text on
images-- do use it.

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:43.740
Use it every opportunity you
have where it makes sense.

00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:45.870
In particular,
think about images

00:39:45.870 --> 00:39:49.220
where the image contains
a lot of content.

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:51.170
Think about
infographics, probably

00:39:51.170 --> 00:39:54.910
the most inaccessible
form of graphic expression

00:39:54.910 --> 00:39:56.690
we have right now on the web.

00:39:56.690 --> 00:39:59.370
An infographic can't be
read by a screen reader,

00:39:59.370 --> 00:40:01.730
and alt text is usually
insufficient in order

00:40:01.730 --> 00:40:03.510
to convey what's in there.

00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:07.830
There is an attribute in
HTML called Long Desk.

00:40:07.830 --> 00:40:11.500
Also, ARIA-describedat
is the ARIA equivalent.

00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:15.300
And all you do is you provide
a URL to a longer description.

00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:19.470
And in the image here, I
have a pretty large graphic

00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:22.310
on the left, and on the
right I have the full text

00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:25.714
transcription of everything
that's going on in the image.

00:40:25.714 --> 00:40:27.630
When I did that, that
links to a separate page

00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:30.130
that held all of my
long descriptions.

00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:32.106
Since then, some
research has been

00:40:32.106 --> 00:40:33.480
done that shows
that users really

00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:36.140
prefer keeping that long
description on the same page

00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:37.670
so that you're not sending
them to another page,

00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:39.378
and then they have to
hit the back button

00:40:39.378 --> 00:40:41.650
and load the page two
more times in total.

00:40:41.650 --> 00:40:43.820
But it's pretty easy
to write that out,

00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:46.857
and I'm speaking-- this
is going to sound weird,

00:40:46.857 --> 00:40:49.190
but if you're a company that
worries about search engine

00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:51.380
optimization, for
example, it's a great way

00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:54.830
to get some valid keywords in
there without keyword stuffing.

00:40:54.830 --> 00:40:57.516
If anybody in the
room thinks I'm wrong,

00:40:57.516 --> 00:40:59.390
this is probably the
best room to tell me so.

00:41:02.070 --> 00:41:03.480
Anybody on there?

00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:04.090
What's that?

00:41:04.090 --> 00:41:05.383
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:05.383 --> 00:41:06.676
ADRIAN ROSELLI: Aw.

00:41:06.676 --> 00:41:08.050
I was counting on you, too.

00:41:10.930 --> 00:41:12.810
There is an alternative
text decision tree.

00:41:12.810 --> 00:41:14.560
I'm putting this up
there to show you

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:17.900
that somebody has
actually mapped out a way

00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:21.280
that you can use a simple
flowchart to figure out,

00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:24.100
should I put alternative
text on the image?

00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:25.290
It looks complex.

00:41:25.290 --> 00:41:26.650
It really isn't.

00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:29.050
Most people already
intuitively understand it.

00:41:29.050 --> 00:41:31.160
You look at it,
and you go, what?

00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:32.300
Is it useful?

00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:33.550
Is it informative?

00:41:33.550 --> 00:41:34.620
Should I describe that?

00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:36.159
Does it have value?

00:41:36.159 --> 00:41:37.700
This is just a
framework just to make

00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:39.280
sure you're going
down the right path

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:41.613
and to sort of validate what
it is you're already doing.

00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:47.270
At the end, I have a
bunch of resources.

00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:49.720
And like I said, these
slides will be available.

00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:53.500
So the W3C has put together
this great article,

00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:55.350
"Web Accessibility
and Older People--

00:41:55.350 --> 00:41:58.150
Meeting the Needs
of Aging Web Users."

00:41:58.150 --> 00:41:59.850
It's also got "Easy
Checks-- A First

00:41:59.850 --> 00:42:04.080
Review of Web Accessibility,"
which is a checklist.

00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:07.550
But like any checklist,
it's just a starting point.

00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:10.240
And it talks about how you make
sure that these things stay

00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:12.284
current and up to date.

00:42:12.284 --> 00:42:14.200
Also, there's a great
article about how people

00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:15.570
with disabilities use the web.

00:42:15.570 --> 00:42:16.400
It's an overview.

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.550
You can dive into
a lot more detail.

00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:20.520
These are really
simple overviews.

00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:23.150
There's a lot more
good stuff out there.

00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:26.160
I have references
for ARIA in here.

00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:29.450
All of these things I think you
guys can also find on your own,

00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:31.970
but Role, State, and Property
for the Quick Reference,

00:42:31.970 --> 00:42:36.290
and all the ARIA dash
whatever attributes.

00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:38.540
And then there are
accessibility tips, designing

00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:42.200
for the elderly, how
to write user stories,

00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:43.900
book excerpt, "A
Web for Everybody,"

00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:48.250
which talks about more of those
user stories and personas.

00:42:48.250 --> 00:42:50.870
And that is my talk.

00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:53.665
Down here I have a URL,
which I'm going to repeat,

00:42:53.665 --> 00:42:55.540
because I'm going to
post these slides later.

00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:57.870
And you are all welcome to
comment with corrections

00:42:57.870 --> 00:43:01.732
or other things,
Rosel.li/Googa11y.

00:43:01.732 --> 00:43:02.690
So I'll spell that out.

00:43:02.690 --> 00:43:08.440
R-O-S-E-L.LI/G-O-O-G-A-1-1-Y.

00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:11.310
It sounded punny when
I came up with it.

00:43:11.310 --> 00:43:13.706
And now that I've set it
aloud, it sounds dumb.

00:43:13.706 --> 00:43:15.580
But that's the URL I've
already put together.

00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:17.790
The slides aren't up there yet.

00:43:17.790 --> 00:43:22.680
Probably tonight or
tomorrow I will post them.

00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:25.080
I will tweet a URL, and I
will send it to whomever

00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:26.810
is interested as well.

00:43:26.810 --> 00:43:28.239
So that's the nature of my talk.

00:43:28.239 --> 00:43:28.780
WOMAN: Great.

00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:29.390
Well, thank you so much.

00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:30.330
This is so great.

00:43:30.330 --> 00:43:30.930
ADRIAN ROSELLI: Thank you.

00:43:30.930 --> 00:43:31.805
Thanks for having me.

00:43:31.805 --> 00:43:35.180
[APPLAUSE]
