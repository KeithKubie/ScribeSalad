00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.380
&gt;&gt; Ben Thompson: Thanks everybody for coming.
This was a better turn out then I got for

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.850
my Seattle book signing a couple months ago
so I am very happy with the turn out. And

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.181
if more people show up, they'll show up and
we can all glare at them when they walk into

00:00:12.181 --> 00:00:18.170
the door and pretend that they are like bastards
for showing up late. AH, so, this is me, my

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.609
name is Ben Thompson I have written a website
called Badass of the Weeks since 2004. Ahhh,

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.619
I got two books, the one that's there, the
one on the left Birth of a Legend just came

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:34.829
out in March and the one on the right, ahh,
Badass came out in 2009. They are basically

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.441
about badass things. Basically what I have
been doing for the last couple of years, you

00:00:40.441 --> 00:00:43.609
know, I find some historical character or
some fictional character that I think is like

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:47.640
really awesome and then I read everything
I could read about them and then I boil their

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.010
stories down to about 1,000 words, cutting
out all the boring stuff and getting to just

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.589
the good parts and then I print these books
and people have been paying me to do it and

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:07.990
hopefully will continue to do so for a while.
Ah, so let's see, ah, so you know, my main

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.980
reason for coming today, giving a talk, you
know George R. Martin is talking at the San

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:19.221
Francisco location so this is kind of like
the B Team, The Farm Squad, ah, so you know

00:01:19.221 --> 00:01:24.670
my main reason for coming is free lunch. But
it is also cool anytime I get invited to go

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.970
anywhere to talk to people, ah, so hopefully
the books are free. You can take some of those,

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.310
I'll sign them for you after if you want.
And I will sign pretty much anything else

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:39.620
that you have that you want me to sign. Ah,
even swords. [laughs] Ah, so, you know, I

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.220
wasn't really sure what to talk about. I asked
Brian and Brian told me I can talk about whatever

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:49.980
I want. Um, that is not incredibly helpful,
today is Bastille Day, that's also not particularly

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:55.760
helpful. There is not a whole lot of Badass
French things going on aside from the guillotine.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:02.090
So I wracked my brain for some ideas of what
I could talk about here and eventually I just

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.340
figured I would talk about the one thing that
I actually know anything about which is my

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.650
books. Ah, and the hopefully badass things
contained within. Ah, I know I am supposed

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.610
to talk for an hour, I probably only have
twenty to thirty minutes of material so, ah,

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.200
unless you want to go back to work you can
start thinking of some interesting questions

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.330
[laughter]
and ah, and I'll answer pretty much, pretty

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.050
much anything.
Ah, alright, so here is the cover of the second

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.780
book. This is the first reading I am going
to do today. I am going to do one from each

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.390
book. Um, like I said, I have no idea how
long that is going to take or how proficient

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.770
I will be at reading my script here. Ah, so
this is the second book, just came out in

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:47.350
March. The story I am going to read is on
Thor. That's the illustration for him, inside

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.850
all the books all the illustrations are done
by guys who did work for Marvel and DC and

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:58.350
Wizards of the Coasts guys and that Magic
Cards, D-n-D folks. Which is really cool,

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.850
'cause when I got the deal to make this book,
I could just go to people who I always thought

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.090
their artwork was awesome and be like, "Hey
you are like my favorite magic card artist.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.600
Can I like pay you to draw some stuff for
my book?" and they are like "Oh, who's publishing

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.180
it?" and I'm like "Harper Collins" and they
are like "OK, Yeah, sure. That sounds good

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.940
buddy, whatever you say." So um, they put
together some cool stuff. This one was done

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.460
by a guy named Matt Haley who used to draw
Batgirl and Supergirl.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:26.870
Ah, let's see, so I start every chapter off
with a quote. This one is for Thor; "No one

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.680
is so wise that he can recount all of Thor's
important deeds. I myself can tell you so

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.640
many significant tales about him that hours
would pass before I have said all that I know."

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:42.290
And that is Snorri Sturluson from his book
Hiemskringla. So this is Snorri, that's the

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.270
historical interpretation of him on the left.
On the right is the World of Warcraft interpretation

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:54.350
of him. Uh, I include the left one for historical
accuracy and the right one for Badass credibility.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:01.590
Ah, Snorri was basically why it's a big deal
that Thor was, nobody could count all of his

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:07.370
important deeds, Snorri was basically the
guy that we know that 95% of Viking and Norse

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.959
Mythology was written down by this guy. He
was just, he was a poet, he spent his entire

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:15.480
life collecting all this stuff, ah, put it
all together into a book, a couple of books,

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.460
and that's the bulk of everything we know
about Viking Mythology. Ah, he was also a

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:24.479
total bastard, he was a politician, he was
a lawyer, ah, he was like a tyrant. He kept

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:29.020
trying to seize control of Iceland and was
eventually killed by five Vikings while cowering

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:35.210
in his wine cellar.
Ok, so here is Thor, I am going to do this

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:41.529
reading. [reads from book ] Thor was the head
smashing Norse god of lighting, thunder, storms,

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:45.430
being awesome and killing giants by hitting
them in the face with an enormous magical

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:51.289
hammer. The son of the god Odin and the goddess
Fjorgyn. Thor was the defender of the Heavenly

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:56.249
land of Asgard. The toughest warrior among
the gods; an original avenger; best friends

00:04:56.249 --> 00:04:59.909
with Captain America and Iron Man. And the
guy who everybody called on whenever they

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:05.009
needed some pompous douches ass kicked out
through his forehead. The life of Thor reads

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:09.900
like a loosely-associated amalgamation of
badass battles and duels thrown together into

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:15.439
one epic narrative of carnage and destruction.
This bloody succession of continual ass beating

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:19.509
usually takes place at the expense of the
hapless race of the Frost Giant, a group of

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:24.680
impossibly-large humanoids who Thor intensely
detested for a variety of borderline-justifiable

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.599
reasons. For instance, one time this giant
architect threw an unnecessarily-violent temper

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:33.789
tantrum when the gods stiffed him on the tap
after building a set of impenetrable fortifications

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:38.860
for Valhalla. So Thor paid the guy back by
caving in his skull with a hammer. Another

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:43.469
time some giant snuck into Thor's house, drank
all of his ale, and boasted that he was going

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:47.289
to go off and have a rape-tastic threesome
with Thor's wife and the fertility goddess

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:51.620
Freyja. And it took the "Take no bull-crap"
Norse hero roughly five seconds to haul ass

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.650
back home, crash his glorious flowing locks
through the walls of Valhalla like a blonde

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:00.439
wrecking ball, and challenge that soon to
be de-brained d-bag to a one-on-one death

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:05.529
match. The dude showed up to the dueling field
clad in armor made from stone and accompanied

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:10.589
by twelve-foot-tall clay gollum. But nothing
was going to deter Thor's implacable fury

00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:15.620
and his insatiable desire for giant homicide.
The Defender of Asgard was so furious and

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.059
pissed about the whole "I'm going to rape
your wife thing" that the gollum took one

00:06:19.059 --> 00:06:23.509
look at this guy and started urinating uncontrollably,
wizzed himself so hard that the liquid piss

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:27.180
melted the clay and dissolved the creature
down into a fetid pool of failure and defeat

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:31.530
and gollum urine. That's right folks, Thor
was so crap-your-pants scary that he could

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:37.689
make inanimate constructs spontaneously spawn
an excretory system solely for the purposes

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:44.289
of wetting themselves. [laughter]
In the ensuing battle between god and giant,

00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:48.680
Thor got a broken off hunk of whetstone lodged
in his head but he didn't even blink. He just

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:53.499
chucked his hammer right through the giant's
eye, blowing out it's brains like a close-range

00:06:53.499 --> 00:06:59.689
headshot with a sawn-off twelve-gauge. In
addition to being utterly terrifying, super-strong,

00:06:59.689 --> 00:07:04.740
and rocking a glorious 1980s hair metal mane
that was, according to the stories, "more

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:10.449
beautiful than gold," Thor was also the owner
of the legendary weapon Mjölnir. Mjölnir

00:07:10.449 --> 00:07:14.589
was a fully-rad warhammer that never missed
its mark when thrown and always seemed to

00:07:14.589 --> 00:07:19.270
bring about the vicious, blunt-force trauma
death of anyone Thor deemed worthy of a painful

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:25.249
demise. This kickass hunk of enchanted runestone
was so intensely hardcore that if you even

00:07:25.249 --> 00:07:29.599
so much as touched the thing without wearing
a special pair of iron gloves, the magical

00:07:29.599 --> 00:07:34.740
energy exuded by the weapon would freak out
and melt your hand. While Mjolnir is easily

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:39.099
one of the sweetest blunt weapons from Mythology,
Thor didn't need its super-crushing powers

00:07:39.099 --> 00:07:43.039
to go out and pummel you into a bloody smear
on the asphalt. [laughter]

00:07:43.039 --> 00:07:47.379
Like one time Loki was captured by the Giant
Geirrod and his three evil daughters. And

00:07:47.379 --> 00:07:51.929
in exchange for freedom Norse religion patron
god of Being a Total Douchebag agreed to trick

00:07:51.929 --> 00:07:56.810
Thor into venturing into Giant Land without
his signature weapon. Thor showed up, looking

00:07:56.810 --> 00:08:01.909
to save Loki from imminent peril, and was
immediately ambushed. First, one of the orgess

00:08:01.909 --> 00:08:05.169
daughters angered Thor by urinating in the
river while he was trying to walk through

00:08:05.169 --> 00:08:09.680
it, so he killed her by flinging a rock through
her head. Then two more giantesses tried to

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:13.929
crush him by smashing him repeatedly against
the ceiling of their stone cottage, but he

00:08:13.929 --> 00:08:17.770
got both hands on the ceiling, pushed down,
and snapped both their backs with one might

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:21.919
shove. Then Geirrod himself showed up and
started taunting the already-berserk Norse

00:08:21.919 --> 00:08:26.590
god, so Thor grabbed a piece of molten hot
iron out of the fireplace and threw it so

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:30.659
hard that it went through a solid stone pillar,
through Geirrod's torso, and blew a hole through

00:08:30.659 --> 00:08:34.729
the wall behind him. I like to think that
after all this happened Thor grabbed a flagon

00:08:34.729 --> 00:08:39.219
of mead and chugged it in one gulp and smashed
the empty mug down on the ground before making

00:08:39.219 --> 00:08:44.690
a James Bond style one-liner riding out into
the sunset like nothing happened.

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:49.500
Thor lived in a gigantic 540-room Valhalla
style fortress called Bilskirnir which was

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:53.990
appropriately situated in the middle of the
Plains of Strength. His favorite hobbies included

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:58.440
drinking mead by the barrel, wading through
rivers, riding around in a chariot pulled

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:03.279
by horse-sized goats, and making expeditions
into uncharted lands for the sole purpose

00:09:03.279 --> 00:09:07.220
of wasting as many Giant asses as he could
fling his hammer at, which turns out to be

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:12.300
a lot. This guy was so good at getting crunked
up on fermented honey and using his mallet

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:16.770
to hammer people into the ground like meaty
tent pegs, that, according to Norse myth thunder

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:21.010
was actually the sound of Thor bashing a guy's
head into a pulp, and the tides were believed

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:25.019
to have been caused when Thor sucked down
half the ocean as part of a drinking contest

00:09:25.019 --> 00:09:30.170
after a Giant magically transformed it into
mead.

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:34.029
Another good drinking story has Thor getting
invited to a feast at the palace of some random

00:09:34.029 --> 00:09:37.650
member of the Frost Giant nobility. If you
were a Giant you would think Thor would be

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:41.019
the last guy you would want to have hanging
around your dinner table, but apparently this

00:09:41.019 --> 00:09:44.880
particular household didn't possess the common
sense necessary to come to this conclusion

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:48.630
themselves and they thought it might be fun
to die painful deaths at the hands of the

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:54.080
Norse god of smiting. Interestingly things
were actually going fine until everyone in

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:58.250
attendance soon became kind of horrified,
when, during the course of one all-you-can-eat

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:03.829
super buffet feast, Thor ate an entire ox,
come on, where's the ox? There we go, entire

00:10:03.829 --> 00:10:09.000
ox, eight salmon and chugged three full barrels
of mead. When the Giants, who, by the way,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.360
are largely portrayed in Norse sagas as ogre-like
barbarians, gave Thor a hard time about consuming

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:19.540
half of their food in the span of a few dozen
ultra-manly gulps, the bane of giantkin, decided

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:23.089
that for dessert he would just kill everyone
in the dining hall with a hammer, because

00:10:23.089 --> 00:10:27.930
screw them for talking smack about his etiquette
skills. So that's what he did.

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:31.681
Thor was also a master of fishing, which seems
like it would be kind of incongruous for a

00:10:31.681 --> 00:10:35.649
guy who shoots lightning out of his hands.
Nevertheless, the presumable-superconductive

00:10:35.649 --> 00:10:39.720
god once went with his buddy on a weekend
fishing trip aimed at catching the horrifically-evil

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:44.670
Midgard Serpent; a giant sea monster so enormous
that its body measured the entire circumference

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:48.699
of the earth. Thor rowed out to the edge of
the world in a crappy little wooden boat,

00:10:48.699 --> 00:10:52.990
threw his line in, snagged the beast, and
lifted it up out of the water, but just as

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:57.210
he was getting ready to bust its skull, Thor's
buddy freaked out and cut the fishing line,

00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:01.070
sending the ghastly monstrosity back below
the waves. Thor was so pissed that he punched

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:07.899
the dude in the mouth, kicked him overboard,
and then rowed home by himself.

00:11:07.899 --> 00:11:11.860
The Maestro of annihilating Giants with a
hammer also plays a central role in one of

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:16.579
the crucial events of Norse Mythology, the
incredibly-bizzare death of the god Baldur.

00:11:16.579 --> 00:11:20.750
The short of the myth is that Baldur, Thor's
half-brother and the god of being inoffensive,

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:25.070
cool, and beloved by everyone, was murdered
one day when the prankster god Loki tricked

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:29.759
the blind dude into throwing a sprig of mistletoe
at him. Why Baldur is so allergic to mistletoe

00:11:29.759 --> 00:11:34.560
that a relatively-unsharpened branch flung
vaguely in his direction caused him to spontaneously

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:38.990
combust into a cloud of death is somewhat
incomprehensible, but needless to say everybody

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:43.839
was pretty pissed off about the whole situation.
Thor led the funeral service, blessed his

00:11:43.839 --> 00:11:46.899
half-brother's funeral pyre and swore vengeance
on Loki.

00:11:46.899 --> 00:11:49.899
[coughed]
Then, out of the blue, some random jackass

00:11:49.899 --> 00:11:53.930
Dwarf started being disrespectful and talking
really loudly during the funeral services

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:58.760
so Thor booted the jerk into a flaming pyre
with a swift kick to the balls. [laughter]

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:05.790
I find that this is hilarious. [more laughter]
Thor's next mission was to track down Loki

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:10.500
and make sure that he was brought to some
incredibly-painful Viking-style justice. He

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:14.959
tracked the Trickster god down, cornered him
in a river, and when Loki morphed himself

00:12:14.959 --> 00:12:19.080
into a salmon and tried to swim away, Thor
grabbed the fish by its tail and hauled it

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:23.580
down to the underworld. Loki's first-born
son was then disemboweled, and the dripping

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:28.589
entrails were used to strap Loki down to a
huge rock. The god's then positioned a giant

00:12:28.589 --> 00:12:32.670
disgusting snake overtop of Loki so that it
dripped super-venomous poison right into his

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:37.329
eyes like a Chinese water torture device from
some sadistic corner of Hell. From that point

00:12:37.329 --> 00:12:41.480
on, Norsemen believe that many natural disasters
were caused by Loki screaming out in agony

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:46.069
and attempting to break free. If strapping
your ex-friend down with his dead kid's intestines

00:12:46.069 --> 00:12:51.589
sounds a little excessive to you, that's because
Thor never half-assed anything in his life,

00:12:51.589 --> 00:12:55.210
especially revenge. Don't feel too badly for
Loki though, he gets a crack at vengeance

00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:59.290
eventually and Thor gets a rematch with the
Midgard Serpent, but I deal with both of those

00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:07.879
in a later chapter when I talk about Ragnarok,
and that's the Thor chapter.

00:13:07.879 --> 00:13:13.160
Um, so, that's the sort of stuff that I like
to read about and so that's the sort of stuff

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:17.589
that I like to write about. And it horrible
and brutal but I have a very large following

00:13:17.589 --> 00:13:27.759
among, like, teenage boys. [laughs] So, it's,
I guess better than not having any fan base

00:13:27.759 --> 00:13:34.029
at all. Ah, so, aside from hacking people
apart and strapping god's down with their

00:13:34.029 --> 00:13:39.300
dead children's intestines, being badass isn't
always about having muscles and cleaving people

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:45.649
apart and destroying them, um so in order
to balance out the brawn of Thor, I wanted

00:13:45.649 --> 00:13:51.639
to talk about a badass nerd scientist who
asserted himself as badass through his insane

00:13:51.639 --> 00:13:56.240
skills of being a total genius, as opposed
to cleaving people apart, though there is

00:13:56.240 --> 00:14:00.740
plenty of cleaving people apart in these two
books if that is what you like. You know I

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:04.069
figured that if I was going to be coming here
to Google and giving a talk, you guys would

00:14:04.069 --> 00:14:15.930
appreciate some nerd power. So that's the
focus of the second story [laughs]. [inaudible]

00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:21.910
So this one is from the first book, ah, which
also has a Viking on the cover though I am

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:26.779
not going to bombard you with two Viking stories
in a ten minute period of time. Ah, I am going

00:14:26.779 --> 00:14:32.060
to talk about Nikola Tesla who's ah probably
the most badass scientist of all time. This

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:36.850
is another piece of art that was done by the
same guy, Matt Haley, and he is pretty unbelievably

00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:42.439
awesome. And here is the actual photo of Tesla
so I was very, very happy with him being able

00:14:42.439 --> 00:14:50.649
to reproduce that mirror image, tracing it
on, or however the heck he did that. And that

00:14:50.649 --> 00:14:53.930
was kind of the cool thing with contracting
these artists. I could just send them like

00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:57.589
a picture like that and be like, take this
guy and make him look like badass with like

00:14:57.589 --> 00:15:01.899
lightening and fireballs flying around. So
it was cool to be able to do that because

00:15:01.899 --> 00:15:07.040
I am not talented at all in that department.
Ah, so, start this with another quote, this

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:11.990
one is a quote from Tesla directly; "By scientific
application we can project destructive energy

00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:16.459
in thread-like beams as far as a telescope
can discern an object. The range of the beams

00:15:16.459 --> 00:15:20.250
is only limited by the curvature of the earth.
Should you launch an attack in an area covered

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:24.340
by these beams, should you, say, send in 10,000
planes or an army of a million, the planes

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:28.220
would be brought down instantly and the army
destroyed." And now Tesla was a guy who claimed

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:31.670
that he actually was capable, he actually
had the schematics in his head to produce

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:38.470
a weapon that would do this. Ah, he thought
it would end war but it probably would just

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:43.040
make war even more horrible. Ah, so, nobody
knows if he actually could do it or not. When

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:48.120
he died, the FBI confiscated all of his property
and they didn't find any details on this,

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:53.120
but his guy had such an insane photographic
memory that, who knows, he might have actually

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:59.800
been capable of it. OK, so I am going to do
the reading on this and then I am out of material,

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:06.279
so we'll do questions or you guys can go finish
your lunch or I can go get my free lunch.

00:16:06.279 --> 00:16:10.059
[laughs]
Pretty much everybody even remotely associated

00:16:10.059 --> 00:16:15.070
with strategy video games has heard the name
Tesla. The Seberian god of Lightning's omnipresent,

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:19.649
even-zapping coils have been ruining the lives
of digital Allied soldiers and gibbing US

00:16:19.649 --> 00:16:24.440
war machines into spare parts since the release
of Command and Conquer: Red Alert in 1996,

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:29.550
but surprisingly few people these days are
familiar with the life and times of one of

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:34.430
humankinds most eccentric, badass and volumetrically-insane
scientific super-freaks [inaudible ] lost

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:43.060
my microphone here. I'm not used to being
wired up to things, so, forgive me. Ok, first

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:47.390
off, Nikola Tesla was brilliant. And not just
like Ken Jennings trivia-master brilliant

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:51.770
either. I mean like, holy Jesus my head just
exploded from all the awesome brilliant. The

00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:56.490
Croation-born engineer spoke eight languages,
almost single-handedly developed technology

00:16:56.490 --> 00:17:01.259
that harnessed the power of electricity for
household use, and invented things like electrical

00:17:01.259 --> 00:17:06.410
generators, FM radio, remote control, robots,
spark plugs, fluorescent lights and giant-ass

00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:11.890
machines that shoot enormous, brain-frying
lightning bolts all over the place. He had

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:16.470
an unyielding, steel-trap photographic memory
and an innate ability to visualize even the

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:20.870
most complex pieces of machinery; the guy
did advance calculus and physics equations

00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:25.870
in his head, memorized entire books at a time,
and successfully pulled off scientific experiments

00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:31.620
that modern-day technology still can't replicate.
For instance, in 2007 a group of lesser geniuses

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:35.710
at MIT got all pumped up out of their minds
because they wirelessly transmitted energy

00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:40.540
a distance of seven feet through the air.
Nikola Tesla once light 200 light bulbs from

00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:45.660
a power source 26 miles away and he did it
in 1899 with a machine he built from spare

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:50.150
parts in the middle of a god-forsaken wasteland
of a mountain range. To this day, nobody can

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:53.870
really figure out how the hell he pulled that
crap off because two-thirds of the schematics

00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:57.940
existed only in the darkest recesses of Tesla's
brain.

00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:02.970
Of course, much like many other eccentric
giga-geniuses and diabolical masterminds,

00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:08.240
Tesla was also completely insane. He was prone
to nervous breakdowns, claimed to receive

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:12.140
weird visions in the middle of the night,
spoke to pigeons, and occasionally thought

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:18.260
he was receiving electromagnetic signals from
extraterrestrials on Mars. He was also obsessive-compulsive

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:25.590
and he hated round objects, human hair, jewelry,
and anything that wasn't divisible by three.

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:30.830
He slept just two or three hours per night
and remained celibate for his entire life.

00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:35.490
Basically, Nikola Tesla was the ultimate mad
scientist, which is pretty rad.

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:39.700
Another sweet thing about Tesla is that he
conducted the sort of crazy experiments that

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:43.830
generally result in hoards of angry villagers
breaking down the door of your lab with torches

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:48.530
and pitchforks. One time, while he was working
on magnetic resonance, he discovered the resonant

00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:52.660
frequency of the Earth and caused an earthquake
so powerful that it almost obliterated the

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:57.181
5th Avenue New York building that housed his
Frankenstein Castle of a laboratory. Stuff

00:18:57.181 --> 00:19:00.930
was flying off the walls, the drywall was
breaking apart, and cops were coming after

00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:04.100
him, and Tesla had to smash this massive devise
with a sledge hammer to keep it from demolishing

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:09.630
an entire city block. And yes I reused that
from the previous slide. Later he boasted

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:14.040
that he could have built a device powerful
enough to split the Earth in two and nobody

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:18.010
dared him to prove it.
Tesla also ordered the construction of the

00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:23.630
Wardenclyff Tesla Tower, a giant building
shaped like an erect penis that would have

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:28.010
housed the largest Tesla coil ever built.
The massive structure, ostensibly designed

00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:33.760
to wirelessly transmit power, has been cited
as a potential cause of the mysterious 1908

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:39.560
Tunguska event, a ten-megaton blast that detonated
in the waste lands above central Russia, completely

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:48.412
deforested everyone, everything, [loud beeper
goes off] [laughs] OK, that was an effect

00:19:48.412 --> 00:19:55.260
for the ten-megaton blast: alarms going off,
a true multi-media presentation. [laughter]

00:19:55.260 --> 00:20:00.700
Ah, so ya, Tunguska, a ten-megaton blast that
detonated in the waste lands above central

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:06.120
Russia, completely deforested everything unlucky
enough to be located within 830 square miles

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:09.970
of the blast site and left an eerie glow that
could be seen in the skies above the earth

00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:15.610
for several days. While nothing has ever successfully
proven Tesla's involvement in the ass-destroying

00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:19.140
huge explosion, it is pretty awesome that
this guy could have potentially detonated

00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:23.740
a weapon 1,000 times more powerful than the
nuclear bomb that destroyed Hiroshima&nbsp;and

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:27.380
had done it before they had invented the submachine
gun.

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:31.060
During his adventures blinding half the world
with science, Nikola Tesla harnessed the power

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:35.660
of Niagara Falls into the first hydroelectric
power plant, constructed a bath designed to

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:40.670
cleanse the human body of germs using nothing
but electricity, and created a 130-foot long

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:44.680
bolt of lightning from one of his massive
coils. It’s a feat that to this day remains

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:49.070
a world record for man-made lightning. But
perhaps the most badass invention was his

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:54.200
face-melting, tank-destroying, super-secret
Atomic Death Ray. In the 1920s he claimed

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:58.390
to be working on a tower that could potential
have spewed forth a gigantic beam of ionized

00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:03.210
particles capable of disintegrating aircraft
from 200 miles away, and blinking most people

00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:08.270
out of existence like something out of a Flash
Gordon or Buck Rogers comic. His weapon, known

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:13.420
as the Teleforce Beam, allegedly shot a ball
of lighting at 60 million volts, liquefying

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:18.800
targets with enough voltage to vaporize steel,
and while it could shoot further than 200

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:22.700
miles in principle, it's effectiveness beyond
that range was limited by the curvature of

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:28.510
the Earth. Luckily, for all humans, this crazy
crap never came to fruition because most of

00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:32.670
the schematics and plans only existed is Tesla's
head, and when he died of heart failure in

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:37.720
1943, little hard data on the project existed.
Still J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI confiscated

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:42.030
all this personal effects and locked them
away anyway, just to be safe.

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:46.260
Despite being incredibly popular during his
day, now Tesla remains largely overlooked

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:51.110
among lists of greatest inventors and scientist
of all times. Edison, Thomas Edison gets all

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:54.990
the glory for discovering the light bulb but
it was his one-time assistant and long-time

00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:59.730
arch-nemesis, Nikola Tesla, who made the breakthroughs
in alternating-current technology that allowed

00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:05.291
for people to cheaply use electricity to power
appliance and lighting in their homes. These

00:22:05.291 --> 00:22:09.100
two constantly fought about whether to use
alternating or direct-currents, their bitter

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:14.470
feud resulted in both men then being snubbed
by the Noble Prize Committee, but ultimately

00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:18.070
Tesla was the one who delivered the fatal
kick-to-the-crotch that ended the battle.

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:23.820
At the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago, his AC
generators illuminated the entire experience,

00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:27.360
marking the first time that an event of that
magnitude had ever taken place under the glow

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:32.600
of artificial light. He also demonstrated
how safe AC power was by running 200 volts

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:37.190
of electricity through his own body just to
be awesome. Today, all homes and appliances

00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:42.250
run on Tesla's AC current.
Nikola Tesla was an incredible super-genius

00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:46.120
whose intellect placed him dangerously on
the precipice between great scientific mind

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:50.760
and utter madness. He held 700 patents at
the time of his death, made groundbreaking

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:55.810
discoveries in the field of physics, robotics,
steam turbine engineering and magnetism, and

00:22:55.810 --> 00:23:00.280
once melted one of his assistants' hands by
overloaded it with X-rays, which isn't particularly

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:04.220
scientific but it is still pretty cool.
And honestly, if there were one man on the

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:08.490
planet who was ever capable of single-handedly
destroying the earth through his insane scientific

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:15.020
discoveries, it was probably Tesla. That alone
should qualify him as a pretty righteous badass.

00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:22.510
So that is end of slide show. So that's all
I have if you guys have questions I am happy

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:27.471
to answer them. If you just want me to read
through all this stuff once more so you can

00:23:27.471 --> 00:23:31.420
keep sitting here and not go back to work,
I am cool with doing that too. [laughter]

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:38.130
Um, so, yeah if there is any questions or
anything alone those lines. Otherwise…

00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:43.500
&gt;&gt; Male #1: So have you actually been updating
your webpage?

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:47.350
&gt;&gt; Ben: Yep, never missed a week. There are
some that I have pulled down off of the website.

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:51.210
They are not active anymore just because like
in the first year of doing it, it was like

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:55.340
"This guy was awesome because he was really
cool." And so those are so terrible that what

00:23:55.340 --> 00:24:04.100
I migrated to a new server I just killed the
link and [laughs]

00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:09.500
&gt;&gt; Male #1: I would think you must have run
out of obvious choices pretty early on, and

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:10.870
how do you [inaudible].
&gt;&gt; Ben: I, ah, it's pretty cool. There is

00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:14.060
actually a lot of pretty big names that I
still haven't touched yet, and I kind of want

00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:17.530
to save them for stuff like, you know, I have
original characters, it's all original characters

00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:23.540
in the two books so some of the real big names
I hold on to them. You know, in case something

00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:26.020
awesome comes through and I can get paid to
write than rather do them for free on the

00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:31.380
website. Ah, but it's actually been pretty
cool like, you know, in the first year or

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:34.780
two I had people that, I studied history in
college, I studied it and I was really into

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:38.860
it in high school and right after college
and I had a list of names that was maybe 30

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:42.630
people long that I wanted to write about.
Within like that first year I started getting

00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:45.830
a lot of email through the website, people
who are like "Oh, this is really cool. You

00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:49.670
should look at this guy." Or somebody will
write me and be like 'Oh, you know I am from

00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:53.210
this tiny country, this person is our national
hero, there is not that much about him in

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:58.710
English, but here is his story." So it's you
know, almost become kind of a community project

00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:04.940
where, like, people send me, I get 20 to 50
emails a day and three-quarters of them are

00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:09.240
like "Hey, you should write about this guy."
At this point like, I have got a list on my

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:14.640
desktop of like 1300 names of people that
I could write about and you know, just from

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:18.380
weird stories that people have sent me. You
know I have heard of a lot of these stories

00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:25.510
that people email me every day, but it's cool
that people want to get involved and I always,

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:28.120
I'm not always going to be able to get to
the stories that people want me to write,

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:34.590
but I like being able to you know, look into
those people for my own personal usage.

00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:43.710
&gt;&gt; Female #1: [inaudible]
&gt;&gt; Ben: A lot of research. I spend a lot of

00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:50.200
money on Amazon and I, uh, I you know, one
of the things that has actually been huge

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:56.990
for me was, uh, Google Books. Like I started
writing the first book around the time that

00:25:56.990 --> 00:26:00.860
Google Books was starting to, I first heard
about Google Books as I was starting to write

00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:06.900
about, write my first book, which was like
'07 or something around that time. It's just

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:10.710
amazing, like some of these like Harvard and
University of Michigan and some of these schools

00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:14.630
that are out there, they are scanning these
materials that you would have to travel to

00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:19.600
DC or Cambridge and go in the special collections
department where they have like the white

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:25.180
gloves and you know, it's amazing to have
some of that material digitized. Not only

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:29.010
so that you can read it from Seattle but also
that can you search the text. If there is

00:26:29.010 --> 00:26:32.620
one obscure character that you want to write
about and he is referenced like three times

00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:38.270
in history, it's cool to be able to just put
that into Google Books and get legit sources,

00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:47.000
legit book sources. Um, you know, it's a lot
of research. What I try to do is I try to

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.040
make sure everything I, I want to make the
stories interesting and fun and you know kind

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:57.870
of cool to read. But I don't want to sacrifice
any of the accuracy so I don't put anything

00:26:57.870 --> 00:27:04.270
into the books, especially, unless I can verify
it in two sources. Two books, not like, not

00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:10.520
like Wikipedia or something. And Wikipedia
by the way is, like, totally evil because

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:15.200
ah, [laughs] because like they'll have stuff
like, I will be going through like sometimes

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:17.230
when I am finished writing the story I'll
go through Wikipedia. And I will be like,

00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:20.910
you know there is some crazy thing that I
missed I wouldn't want to leave it out so

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:25.150
there is some kind of, it's kind of good sometimes
for getting leads, "Oh, you know, this person

00:27:25.150 --> 00:27:29.060
once ran for Congress" and you didn't know
that before so I will go check that out. But

00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:34.430
they'll have references cited in line and
you'll click on the citation and it will give

00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:38.280
you the book and the edition and the page
numbers. And then you will find that exact

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:42.100
book, and reference and page number and it's
not even talking about the person that like

00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:49.010
the article is on. It's like horrible stuff
so [laughter] so I don't, it's all books or

00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:55.380
Google Books basically. Then there is a ton
of references in the back of each book as

00:27:55.380 --> 00:28:00.400
to where, all the link that I went to. Yes.
&gt;&gt; Male #2: So I was going to ask you about

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:06.330
your favorite most like Badass real person
and then fictional.

00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:12.870
&gt;&gt; Ben: Well, it's very difficult for me to
pick favorites. So like Badass 1 is like a

00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:18.880
Top 40 and this is like a Top 40 fictional.
You know when I started writing both of these

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:23.340
I had a list of 100 people that I thought
would fit in there and then trying to wiggle

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:27.920
it down to 40 is kind of like trying to figure
out which finger you want amputated, or like

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:32.400
which of your kids you want to like sacrifice
to the gods. Ah, it was very difficult for

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:36.350
me to like get it down to even 40. I feel
like I could do five or six books on each

00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:42.010
topic and still like have a list of characters
to write about. Ah, the guy I like to talk

00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:46.250
about the most when I am talking about what
I am doing with Badass of the Week and with

00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:53.570
the books is an Irish warrior named Wolf the
Quarrelsome, and ah, Wolf was this Irish Barbarian

00:28:53.570 --> 00:29:01.951
who fought the Vikings in 1100 or 1000 or
some time along those lines and uh, basically

00:29:01.951 --> 00:29:06.920
like the Vikings came to the Island, this
guy served the High King of Ireland, he lead

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:11.000
this battle, he defeated the Vikings, but
as some of the Vikings were fleeing they found

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.440
the King of the Irish and they beheaded him
while he was in his prayers. So this guy hears

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:19.900
about this, tracks them down before they leave
the Island, before they finish retreating,

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:24.540
finds the guy who assassinated the King, kills
all that guy's bodyguards by himself, cuts

00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:29.130
the guy's torso open with an axe and ties
like one of his intestines to a tree and like

00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:34.760
forces the dude to walk around the tree until
he dies. [laughter] So this guy like, he contributes

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:39.930
nothing of value to history, he doesn’t
like produce anything, any kind of, he has

00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:45.100
no significant lasting effect, the Viking
come back, they concur Ireland you know, whatever.

00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:47.450
But that's the kind of story that when you
are reading the history of the High King of

00:29:47.450 --> 00:29:50.510
Ireland, well, he was killed and then some
guy found the Viking that killed him and disemboweled

00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:55.680
him. I was like, Ok, well let's hear more
about his guy, so, you know I try to dig up

00:29:55.680 --> 00:30:00.310
people like that. He only really appears in
history like three or four times doing different

00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:08.240
badass things, so I love finding stories like
that and just trying to write, find as much

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:11.750
as I can about these crazy people and write
about them.

00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:17.700
&gt;&gt; Male #3: [inaudible] do you differentiate
between the badass [inaudible]

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:23.640
&gt;&gt; Ben: Yeah, I tried to, you know, it's,
you know, I don't write about like serial

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:29.860
killers and stuff. So you know, I guess I've
got people like Vlad the Impaler in there

00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:35.150
who are just these horrible, just horrible,
horrible human beings but I guess when you

00:30:35.150 --> 00:30:38.040
are like impaling people in like the thirteenth
century you are far enough removed that you

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:42.610
can like make jokes about it without sounding
like a total bastard. [laughs] so you know,

00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:56.661
more recent serial killer types, you know,
&gt;&gt; Male #3: [inaudible] so something that

00:30:56.661 --> 00:31:05.312
is totally good, or do something that is totally
bad-

00:31:05.312 --> 00:31:06.312
&gt;&gt; Ben: Yeah

00:31:06.312 --> 00:31:07.312
&gt;&gt; Male #3: [inaudible]

00:31:07.312 --> 00:31:08.380
&gt;&gt;Ben: [laughs] Yeah, yeah I mean there is
some of that, there is some of that. You know,

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:14.190
I don't think it's, you see all kinds of violence
in TV and the kids are going to be exposed

00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:19.470
to violence and things and if there are children
in the audience when I am doing a reading

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:23.280
I usually tell them not to use this as a how-to
guide. [laughs]

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:30.740
&gt;&gt; Male #4: Are there any other groups you
don't do, like serial killers or so?

00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:35.470
&gt;&gt; Ben: Well I, I've written about a serial
killer or two but actually, you know I try

00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:39.100
to avoid it cause it is just tough. Some subjects
are just pretty heavy you can't really write

00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:45.000
about them without just sounding like you
are really being insensitive to the, just

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.110
being basically a bastard. But I don't usually
write about too many serial killers. I have

00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:55.410
a hard time writing about like Nazi's and
you know, I haven't really written about anything

00:31:55.410 --> 00:32:00.420
with like civil rights in America or the Holocaust.
I mean, take the Holocaust, there are so many

00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:04.320
just amazing stories of like brave people
standing up and doing these unbelievable things

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:09.970
but I don't really know that you could write
about it next to, put it in a book next to

00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:17.030
a chapter, next to the chapter on Thor and
have it sound like you are not being disrespectful.

00:32:17.030 --> 00:32:20.670
So there are certain things that I feel like
I couldn't really touch.

00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:28.610
&gt;&gt; Male #5: Just a really specific question,
I have heard some skepticism about the account

00:32:28.610 --> 00:32:34.430
of Tesla's [inaudible] machine. What evidence
you have come up with?

00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:38.180
&gt;&gt; Ben: Well, there is, there is. And the
same thing with Tunguska, there was a lot

00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:45.281
of people saying that it was probably a meteor.
Ah, basically like I really want it to be

00:32:45.281 --> 00:32:50.350
true [laughs] and I found it in two or three
legit books where like this biographer mentions

00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:56.400
it and it is like a pretty popular story involving
him. And a lot of the research about the earthquakes

00:32:56.400 --> 00:33:00.972
and how it might not have happened was pretty
recent, and like I said I found it in like

00:33:00.972 --> 00:33:05.680
two or three legit sources, so, I reprinted
it. And what I would like to say is that if

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:09.760
it's wrong, it's because my sources are wrong.
[laughs] That's like my way of passing the

00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:14.250
buck. [laughs] If it's cool and if it is associated
with them I am going to do everything I can

00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:19.240
to include it. And if it is really, like really
touchy, I wrote about this guy from Chile

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:24.870
who was a warrior like a Mapuche Indian Warrior
who fought the conquistadors and the conquistadors

00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:27.630
captured him and they cut off both of his
hands. And then there is this story where

00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:33.541
he strapped swords, had swords like tied to
his hands and went back and fought them with

00:33:33.541 --> 00:33:38.183
like Wolverine arms. And I wanted it to be
true so back, but I could like only find it

00:33:38.183 --> 00:33:43.000
in two or three sources, and they were really
unreliable. So I included it of course in

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.870
the story, and I wrote about it and I put
a little note in it like, this could be bullshit,

00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:55.292
but, but I really hope it is not.
Any other questions about… yeah.

00:33:55.292 --> 00:34:02.370
&gt;&gt; Male #6: Tell us about how you started
with this and with the website.

00:34:02.370 --> 00:34:05.760
&gt;&gt; Ben: Ah, mostly I worked a horrible desk
job right after college, ah, that was just

00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:12.580
completely wasting, my brain was like melting
out of my ear because, you know, it's just

00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:15.441
basically like administrative assistant. Like
I was like a personal assistant for like a

00:34:15.441 --> 00:34:23.760
faculty person and it was, it was pretty mind
numbing. We didn't teach summer courses so

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:27.280
the faculty would all leave over the summer
and I'm sitting there by myself in this office

00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:31.500
because somebody has to be there in case somebody
walks in or calls. There's no courses, nothing

00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:37.300
for me to do, so I am sitting there and I
just started putting these, they were only

00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:40.760
like two paragraphs when I first started.
And posting to this website and emailing the

00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:47.179
link around to my friends and ah, you know,
I was getting seven hits a week for like,

00:34:47.179 --> 00:34:51.610
you know, the first like four months of the
website. Which was like, me twice and like

00:34:51.610 --> 00:34:59.350
my five friends [laughs] so it eventually
just kind of caught on randomly and people

00:34:59.350 --> 00:35:03.680
started following it and the next thing I
know I am getting like a 100 to a 1000, I

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:08.940
get like 2 million hits a month on the website
now, which is like an unfathomable number

00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:13.070
to me. [laughs] I know I am not refreshing
it that much [laughter] just to like pad my

00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:19.590
ads. [pause]
&gt;&gt; Male #7: Have you contributed to or cooperated

00:35:19.590 --> 00:35:23.180
with Cracked.com?
&gt;&gt; Ben: Yep, I did a piece for Cracked to

00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:28.180
promote the first book. Cracked was actually
the reason I wrote the first book, 'Cause

00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:32.590
I was doing this all, posting this all for
free and I didn't even have ads or anything.

00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:37.890
I've got some Google ads up there now that
are decent for me and uh, yah, and then I

00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:40.550
started seeing that they were posting all
of this stuff like "Badass Precedence" and

00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:44.150
I was like I wrote about four of these five
guys. They are cribbing all of my jokes [laughs]

00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:47.610
So I was like – Ok, if someone is going
to get paid for this it should be me. [laughter]

00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:51.830
So I started, so that's when I pitched it
as a book and this was right after like Madexx

00:35:51.830 --> 00:35:56.480
was like the number one best seller for like
ten weeks on Amazon or something. So I submitted

00:35:56.480 --> 00:36:01.340
it to a, I just sent my website and like a
little query letter to my, to an agent that

00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:04.400
I found randomly on the internet. And he calls
me up and he is like "Don't show this to anybody.

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:09.570
We are going to try to pitch this as a book."
[laughs] So it ended up working out pretty

00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:13.260
well for me. I was looking him up and I was
thinking like, well he hasn't asked me to

00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:17.520
like wire funds to Kenya yet, you know, I
don't know what the deal is but why would

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:21.990
he call me up and tell me this. The next week
he calls me up and he is like "Oh, we'll put

00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:25.720
a proposal together." So we put the proposal
together, he sends it out, he's like "Sky

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:31.270
Horse Publishing is," no not Sky Horse it
was some publisher that's like even that I

00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:34.460
have never heard of before, "they are like
offering you five hundred dollars for the

00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:38.930
book." And I was like "SOLD!" and he was like
– NO,no! NO, no, let's wait. Let's see what

00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:44.760
else we can get. [laughter] You could hear
him like in slow motion, like No-o-o-o-o-o!

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:48.220
[laughter] So it just ended up taking off
from there. And to promote the first book

00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:55.580
I did a piece on last stands, one man last
stands. Just like five people who like cause

00:36:55.580 --> 00:37:00.050
is lost, and just a huge army of people opposed
to them and they just had her standing there

00:37:00.050 --> 00:37:03.570
with an ax or a gun or something trying to
hold off like an entire army by themselves.

00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:05.530
It was those kinds of stories that I love
anyways.

00:37:05.530 --> 00:37:11.100
Other questions?
&gt;&gt; Male #8: Have you ever thought about branching

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:17.350
out into fiction?
&gt;&gt; Ben: I am trying to, I'm starting, I just

00:37:17.350 --> 00:37:22.200
started working on the third book and ah,
that's taking up most of my time because I

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:25.710
have a deadline on that and I am getting paid
to do it, so. Fiction is a little bit of a

00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:29.880
different beast where you have to write the
book first. Non-fiction, you say "I've got

00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:32.480
this great idea for a book. Here's three writing
samples." And they say great we will give

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:37.840
you this much money to have it ready for us
by this period of time. Which is great, because

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:41.721
I am like a total procrastinator, and I need
like the first six months to do nothing and

00:37:41.721 --> 00:37:46.140
the last six months to like work my ass off.
[laughter] And so with fiction you have to

00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:52.460
have at least like 200 pages written or something
and then submit it like that. Ah, I was tooling

00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:55.970
around with it after, between the time that
I finished promoting this and I started writing

00:37:55.970 --> 00:38:01.000
the new one. Ah, but, it's only like twenty
pages or thirty pages, it's not enough. But

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.580
I would like to do that, I am taking a, I'm
also taking a screen writing class in the

00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:10.550
fall and UW to try to work on that a little
bit. We are trying to pitch this as a TV show,

00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:11.550
but that's not really fiction. So, we will
see.

00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:12.550
&gt;&gt; Male #9: How do you handle the two to three
sources with fiction so it's not, this guy

00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:23.620
made it up, this source.
&gt;&gt; Ben: Yeah, exactly. Fiction is a totally

00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:27.720
different thing like, cause fiction nobody
is going to come back to you and be like "Ah,

00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:32.950
Thor didn't actually throw that through the
guys stomach." Thor didn't actually do anything.

00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:38.970
He's not real. So, you know, that was one
of the fun things about doing this book was

00:38:38.970 --> 00:38:43.790
that, you know, I think I prefer doing the
historical characters but it was a lot of

00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:48.610
fun to do the second book because the myths
are insane to begin with. Some of these stories

00:38:48.610 --> 00:38:54.110
are just completely crazy, over the top, out
there stuff and some of them only have one

00:38:54.110 --> 00:38:58.010
source. If you want to know about Samson you
read the Bible and that's your source. You

00:38:58.010 --> 00:39:03.270
want to write an article on Dirty Harry you
watch the Dirty Harry movies and that's your

00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:08.310
source. So, ah, so with fiction you can, you
have a little bit more leeway to go back and

00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:11.370
forth. If you are going to write an article
on Batman you would have to pick an origin

00:39:11.370 --> 00:39:16.750
story and not like, you know, the eight hundred
that exist for him. So, it's cool 'cause you

00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:25.610
can just take your favorite.
&gt;&gt; Male #3: Are some of your books available

00:39:25.610 --> 00:39:30.740
online?
&gt;&gt; Ben: I think there's, I think they are

00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:37.310
both on Google Books and there's a, I think
there is a preview on Amazon. There's, it's

00:39:37.310 --> 00:39:40.150
through, there is a Kindle version but you
have to pay for that.

00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:41.150
&gt;&gt; Male #3: I just have a side question. Nowadays
what I kind of notice is that people are spending

00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:53.890
less and less on books, it's a kind of trend.
And does this have some [inaudible] factor

00:39:53.890 --> 00:40:00.980
in you deciding [inaudible]
&gt;&gt; Ben: Well the cool thing with this was

00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:05.500
that, you know, it kind of works the other
way for me. Was that like these internet people

00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:10.100
were, people who have websites were getting
books published and were becoming best sellers

00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:13.610
because they had this pre-installed fan base
of their website. And then books are getting

00:40:13.610 --> 00:40:17.481
killed, you know, authors who have published
huge series are getting killed, they are not

00:40:17.481 --> 00:40:20.801
like selling books, they are having a hard
time getting the deals. So at the time I was

00:40:20.801 --> 00:40:26.810
pitching this, the book guys were looking
for people who were on the internet and hadn't

00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:32.050
published anything before and so that worked
out pretty well for me. Ah, what I wanted

00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:36.230
to do was to try to find a cool way to like,
you know, I had this pre-installed base of

00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:39.579
people who had read, and I've gotten a lot
of feedback and it's like "these are my favorite

00:40:39.579 --> 00:40:42.330
articles on your website." Blah, blah, blah.
So for each of these books I included like

00:40:42.330 --> 00:40:47.140
my top ten off the website in terms of like
feedback from people and hits that I had received

00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:51.020
and it was posted on StumbleUpon or it was
posted on Reddit or something. So I included

00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:55.510
the top ten and I did thirty new ones that
aren't available on the web. Just because

00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:59.000
if you are going to spend seventeen dollars
it you should get something that you know,

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.550
you are not going to be getting, you can't
get it for free. There is no point in paying

00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:06.640
for it, you are not going to pay for just
the artwork or whatever, to be able to hold

00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:14.630
it. So you know.
&gt;&gt; Male #3: [inaudible]

00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:18.680
&gt;&gt; Ben: That's possible. I know there is a
Kindle version of this and like I said the

00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:22.220
top ten from the website are on there and
you know if I drive traffic to the website

00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:28.640
that's still, the website traffic actually
pays me, I see more of that income then I

00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:35.200
do of my royalties [laughs].
&gt;&gt; Male #3: Are you as passionate for these

00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:41.520
kind of materials, [inaudible] nowadays you
buy a book [inaudible].

00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:44.690
&gt;&gt;Ben: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Male #3: [inaudible].

00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:51.670
&gt;&gt;Ben: Yeah, yeah, the tricky part is you
know, all that is basically Harpers owns it

00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:57.070
all so they, you know, I think they would
have to, if I was going to put this on it

00:41:57.070 --> 00:42:02.650
would have to be through them. I don't think
I would see very much of the benefits from

00:42:02.650 --> 00:42:11.280
them. Ah, any other questions?
[pause]

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:16.250
Ok, well thank you guys for coming and all.
I will sign books and stuff.
