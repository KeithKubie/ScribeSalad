All right, this --
this is gonna take

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:11.377 size:63% position:69%
some serious thought
and contemplation.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:12.578 size:66% position:33%
I might have to
stand up.

00:00:12.611 --> 00:00:14.347 align:start size:47% position:53%
For reals?

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.115 size:63% position:69%
You can stand up
if you want, sure.

00:00:16.148 --> 00:00:16.883 align:start size:97% position:3%
Can I? Is it legal?

[ Chuckles ]

00:00:18.284 --> 00:00:19.786 size:66% position:33%
I want to keep it
in justice.

00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:21.187 align:start size:75% position:25%
We can't possibly decide

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.757
about this
Chippendales/Chips Ahoy! thing.

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:26.893 size:63% position:31%
I almost drowned
in there.

00:00:26.926 --> 00:00:28.027
[ Both laugh ]

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.295 size:63% position:69%
It's got --
It's got too much.

00:00:29.328 --> 00:00:30.963 align:start size:88% position:13%
Can you swim?

00:00:30.996 --> 00:00:32.365 align:start size:66% position:34%
[ Laughing ] It's got
too much water in it.

00:00:32.398 --> 00:00:33.599 align:start size:94% position:6%
[ Coughing ] Yes.

00:00:33.632 --> 00:00:35.068 size:72% position:64%
What do people call you
for short,

00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:36.202 size:69% position:66%
or do they use
your whole first name?

00:00:36.235 --> 00:00:37.203 align:start size:97% position:3%
Jess. Call me Jess.

00:00:37.236 --> 00:00:37.970 align:start size:34% position:66% line:92%
Jess?

00:00:37.236 --> 00:00:37.970 align:start size:84% position:16%
Yeah.

00:00:38.003 --> 00:00:38.971 align:start size:53% position:47%
I didn't know.

00:00:39.004 --> 00:00:40.106 align:end size:56% position:56%
Keep it chill.
Call me Jess.

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:41.140 size:66% position:67%
But I like your name,
too, though.

00:00:41.173 --> 00:00:42.408 align:start size:84% position:16%
Call me J.

00:00:42.441 --> 00:00:43.476 size:63% position:31%
You can just make it
a noise.

00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:44.744 align:start size:25% position:75% line:92%
J?

00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:44.744 align:start size:97% position:3%
Just like, fhht!

00:00:44.777 --> 00:00:46.479 size:75% position:63%
J brings it back
to the whole weed thing.

00:00:46.512 --> 00:00:47.747 align:start size:88% position:13%
Yeah, right?

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.215 size:81% position:59%
But I also do like calling
you pbht!

Fhht!

[ Both laugh ]

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.585 align:start position:0%
Wouldn't it be great --

00:00:52.618 --> 00:00:53.653 align:start size:56% position:44%
Not in chambers!

00:00:53.686 --> 00:00:55.121 align:start size:84% position:16%
[ Laughs ]

00:00:55.154 --> 00:00:56.222 align:start size:63% position:38%
Respect my chambers!

00:00:56.255 --> 00:00:57.323 align:start size:91% position:9%
I don't know --

00:00:57.356 --> 00:00:58.591 align:start size:78% position:22%
Do you want some cookies?

00:00:58.624 --> 00:01:00.493 size:78% position:39%
Yeah, like this little --
this ramekin.

00:01:00.526 --> 00:01:01.160 align:start size:84% position:16%
Very cute.

00:01:01.193 --> 00:01:02.228 align:start size:53% position:47%
I like it, too.

00:01:02.261 --> 00:01:03.296 align:start size:91% position:9%
It's adorable.

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.431 size:59% position:70%
Oh, shit.
Chippendales?

00:01:05.464 --> 00:01:07.133 align:start size:66% position:34%
More like Chips Ahoy!

00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:08.935 align:start size:84% position:16%
[ Laughs ]

00:01:08.968 --> 00:01:10.136 align:start position:0%
Isn't that the joke?

00:01:10.169 --> 00:01:11.237 align:start size:56% position:44%
That's the joke.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.605 align:start size:88% position:13%
It's so bad.

00:01:12.638 --> 00:01:13.806 size:63% position:69%
But I think
both of those guys

00:01:13.839 --> 00:01:15.608 size:59% position:70%
sell that joke
on a nightly basis.

00:01:15.641 --> 00:01:17.076 size:63% position:31%
I want to know
what his closer was.

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:18.010 align:start position:0%
Was like a Dorito bit?

00:01:18.043 --> 00:01:21.581
[ Both laugh ]

00:01:21.614 --> 00:01:23.749 size:66% position:33%
Was it like
a Frito-Lay closer?

00:01:23.782 --> 00:01:25.985 align:end position:100%
Doritos? More like
full of shit-o's!

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.823
I used to be Peppermint Patty.
But now I'm Peppermint Fatty.

00:01:30.856 --> 00:01:32.625 size:66% position:33%
[ Laughing ] You're
all out of sync, man.

00:01:32.658 --> 00:01:35.161 size:66% position:33%
You got it
all switched up, man.

00:01:35.194 --> 00:01:36.762 size:63% position:69%
This guy's dad
was coming up with

00:01:36.795 --> 00:01:38.097 size:59% position:70%
a million of them
every day.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.031 align:start size:91% position:9%
Wait a minute.

00:01:39.064 --> 00:01:40.600 align:start size:78% position:22%
$1,000?

00:01:40.633 --> 00:01:42.768 align:start position:0%
Like, I've got jokes, and I
think a lot of them are funny,

00:01:42.801 --> 00:01:44.871 size:78% position:39%
but I don't know if I can
put a price point

00:01:44.904 --> 00:01:46.472 size:78% position:39%
on one of my shitty jokes
at a G!

00:01:46.505 --> 00:01:47.874 align:start size:72% position:28%
That's what I'm saying.

00:01:47.907 --> 00:01:49.475 size:84% position:58%
If your friends
and you say something funny

00:01:49.508 --> 00:01:51.844 align:end position:100%
and one comedian says,
"Hey, can I have that?"

00:01:51.877 --> 00:01:53.379 align:start size:69% position:31%
You either go, "Sure."
