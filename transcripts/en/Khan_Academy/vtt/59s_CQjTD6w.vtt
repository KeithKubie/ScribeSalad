00:00:00.674 --> 00:00:03.335
- [Voiceover] Which
shapes are symmetrical?

00:00:03.335 --> 00:00:05.690
To answer this, we need
to know what it means

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.190
for a shape to be symmetrical.

00:00:09.368 --> 00:00:11.576
A shape is symmetrical if it has

00:00:11.576 --> 00:00:14.076
at least one line of symmetry,

00:00:16.027 --> 00:00:17.610
a line of symmetry.

00:00:19.322 --> 00:00:21.363
And now that answer is only helpful

00:00:21.363 --> 00:00:24.533
if we know what a line of symmetry is.

00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:26.866
So let's talk about it.

00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:31.715
A line of symmetry is a line
where we can fold the image

00:00:31.715 --> 00:00:34.632
and have both halves match exactly.

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:38.472
Let's look at an example.

00:00:38.472 --> 00:00:40.555
Let's maybe draw a circle

00:00:42.171 --> 00:00:44.386
and then we could put
a line on that circle.

00:00:44.386 --> 00:00:48.053
Let's draw a line maybe
somewhere like this.

00:00:49.443 --> 00:00:52.069
This line is a line of symmetry

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:55.155
if we can take one side of the line

00:00:55.155 --> 00:00:59.209
and fold it onto the other
and have them match exactly.

00:00:59.209 --> 00:01:01.372
So let's take one side,
doesn't matter which one,

00:01:01.372 --> 00:01:03.289
let's say the top side,

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.366
and if we were gonna fold

00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:08.358
this top side down onto the bottom,

00:01:08.358 --> 00:01:12.406
would it match exactly
what is shown under here?

00:01:12.406 --> 00:01:16.573
Let's see, it would probably
look something like this.

00:01:17.763 --> 00:01:19.267
And does that match exactly?

00:01:19.267 --> 00:01:21.023
No, definitely not.

00:01:21.023 --> 00:01:23.856
So this is not a line of symmetry.

00:01:26.366 --> 00:01:28.283
Let's try another line.

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:30.545
Maybe if we drew a line

00:01:30.545 --> 00:01:34.927
and we'll try to get as close
down the center as we can here

00:01:34.927 --> 00:01:35.760
like this.

00:01:39.301 --> 00:01:40.990
Try to be as close to
the center as possible

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.648
and here if we took one side,

00:01:42.648 --> 00:01:43.853
again it doesn't matter which side,

00:01:43.853 --> 00:01:46.814
let's say over here,
let's say the left side,

00:01:46.814 --> 00:01:50.897
and we folded this left
side onto the right side,

00:01:52.171 --> 00:01:53.801
would it match exactly

00:01:53.801 --> 00:01:56.587
and if our line truly was
in the center of the circle,

00:01:56.587 --> 00:01:58.087
then yes it would,

00:01:59.492 --> 00:02:03.999
which means that this
line is a line of symmetry

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:07.607
and because we can draw this
line of symmetry on our circle,

00:02:07.607 --> 00:02:10.933
it means that our circle is symmetrical.

00:02:10.933 --> 00:02:12.863
Shapes are symmetrical if they have

00:02:12.863 --> 00:02:15.781
at least one line of symmetry

00:02:15.781 --> 00:02:18.094
and circles have many, many,
many lines of symmetry.

00:02:18.094 --> 00:02:20.602
There was many places we
could have drawn a line

00:02:20.602 --> 00:02:22.329
and folded it so that it worked

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:24.719
so the two halves matched exactly.

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:27.080
But here's one and as soon as we find one,

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.382
we know we have a symmetrical shape.

00:02:30.382 --> 00:02:32.353
So let's go back to the
shapes we were given.

00:02:32.353 --> 00:02:34.613
We can start with the triangle.

00:02:34.613 --> 00:02:36.717
If we draw a line, maybe a vertical line,

00:02:36.717 --> 00:02:39.029
let's try to draw it as close
to the middle as possible,

00:02:39.029 --> 00:02:40.696
something like this,

00:02:41.602 --> 00:02:43.455
and we fold, let's take one side,

00:02:43.455 --> 00:02:45.579
if we fold this side over,

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:48.226
these two lines might match up nicely,

00:02:48.226 --> 00:02:52.393
but this line here is gonna
create something more like this,

00:02:53.263 --> 00:02:56.084
which does not match
what's shown over here,

00:02:56.084 --> 00:02:58.418
so that's not a line of symmetry,

00:02:58.418 --> 00:03:00.375
and anywhere else vertical, same thing.

00:03:00.375 --> 00:03:02.507
We're not gonna have it lined up.

00:03:02.507 --> 00:03:04.924
So let's try maybe a horizontal line.

00:03:04.924 --> 00:03:07.975
Is there anywhere horizontally
we could draw a line?

00:03:07.975 --> 00:03:09.974
And again, I think we're
gonna see the same thing

00:03:09.974 --> 00:03:11.423
that the top and the bottom of the line

00:03:11.423 --> 00:03:14.725
are not gonna match up exactly.

00:03:14.725 --> 00:03:16.487
So maybe one last thing we could try

00:03:16.487 --> 00:03:19.671
is a diagonal line, something like this.

00:03:19.671 --> 00:03:22.583
Maybe this could be our line of symmetry.

00:03:22.583 --> 00:03:24.951
If we fold this bottom side,

00:03:24.951 --> 00:03:27.905
this might line up pretty nice here

00:03:27.905 --> 00:03:32.072
and then this side is gonna
do something like this.

00:03:33.457 --> 00:03:35.505
So it's close, it's the
closest we've gotten,

00:03:35.505 --> 00:03:37.769
but still does not match exactly.

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.865
For it to be a line of symmetry,
it needs to match exactly.

00:03:41.865 --> 00:03:44.895
So we weren't able to find a
way to draw a vertical line

00:03:44.895 --> 00:03:48.433
or a horizontal line or
even the diagonal line.

00:03:48.433 --> 00:03:51.296
So this shape has no lines of symmetry.

00:03:51.296 --> 00:03:54.296
So we can say it is not symmetrical.

00:03:56.396 --> 00:03:59.140
Moving on to the rectangle.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.129
Let's try here.

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:02.776
Again, this time maybe
we'll try a horizontal line.

00:04:02.776 --> 00:04:04.943
We can draw one right here

00:04:06.211 --> 00:04:08.143
and if that line truly is in the middle,

00:04:08.143 --> 00:04:10.438
which is what I've tried for,

00:04:10.438 --> 00:04:14.203
then this side should match
up nicely to this one,

00:04:14.203 --> 00:04:17.352
across the top should
match across the bottom

00:04:17.352 --> 00:04:19.985
and these sides, if I was
right at the halfway point,

00:04:19.985 --> 00:04:22.688
should fold over each other also.

00:04:22.688 --> 00:04:25.990
So it has a line of symmetry
so it is symmetrical.

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.731
It has more than one line of symmetry.

00:04:27.731 --> 00:04:31.340
It has another one in
the middle right here.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.282
But once we've found one, we
know that it's symmetrical.

00:04:35.282 --> 00:04:38.125
And finally, let's look,
we have a pentagon.

00:04:38.125 --> 00:04:40.897
Here again, trying a line
in the middle in some way

00:04:40.897 --> 00:04:43.356
is usually a good place to start.

00:04:43.356 --> 00:04:44.854
We can try to draw a line right

00:04:44.854 --> 00:04:48.021
if this is right down the center here.

00:04:49.624 --> 00:04:52.173
Then if we folded this side,

00:04:52.173 --> 00:04:55.090
should line up nicely to this side,

00:04:56.054 --> 00:04:58.668
this side and this side would overlap

00:04:58.668 --> 00:05:00.849
and these two would match exactly.

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:05.265
So again, has one line of
symmetry so it is symmetrical

00:05:05.265 --> 00:05:06.505
and just like the rectangle,

00:05:06.505 --> 00:05:08.275
this one had quite a
few lines of symmetry.

00:05:08.275 --> 00:05:10.600
Here's another line of symmetry,

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.337
here's another line of symmetry,

00:05:13.337 --> 00:05:16.395
here's one more line of symmetry

00:05:16.395 --> 00:05:18.269
and so it has quite a few.

00:05:18.269 --> 00:05:20.686
It has it looks like one, two, three,

00:05:20.686 --> 00:05:22.644
four lines of symmetry,

00:05:22.644 --> 00:05:25.751
but as long as it has
one, it is symmetrical.

00:05:25.751 --> 00:05:27.687
So of the shapes we were given,

00:05:27.687 --> 00:05:31.687
the rectangle and the
pentagon were symmetrical.
