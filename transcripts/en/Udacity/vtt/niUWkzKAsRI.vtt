00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.913
This example, a stub AS, in this case 30308, might

00:00:04.913 --> 00:00:10.151
receive IP address space, say, 12.20.249/24,

00:00:10.151 --> 00:00:15.292
from one of its providers, such as AT&amp;T, which happens to own

00:00:15.292 --> 00:00:20.308
12.0.0.0/8. Now in this case, AS 30308

00:00:20.308 --> 00:00:25.420
wants to be multihomed. In other words, it wants to be reachable via

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.450
two upstream Internet service providers. In this

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.110
diagram, the two Internet service providers are AT&amp;T

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:38.830
and Verizon. To be reachable by both of these ISPs, AS 30308 has to advertise

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:44.870
its prefix, which it received from AT&amp;T. By a both AT&amp;T and Verizon. The problem

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.820
occurs when AT&amp;T and Verizon want to advertise

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.970
that prefix to the rest of the internet.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.880
Well unfortunately, although AT&amp;T might like to

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.210
aggregate this prefix as I previously described, it

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.080
can't. If it did, Verizon would still

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.897
be advertising the longer /24 by it's upstream

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:06.580
link. And because it's longest prefix match,

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.530
all of the traffic would then arrive via

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.580
the Verizon link regardless of what AS 30308

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.100
wanted to have happened to that incoming traffic.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:22.980
As a result, both AT&amp;T and Verizon must advertise the same /24 to the rest of

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.385
the internet. This results in an explosion of

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:28.590
/24s, in the global internet routing table. You

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.310
can imagine, that if a lot of stub

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.790
AS's, wanted to be multihomed, then suddenly, we've

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.730
got a lot more /24s, in the global

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:42.010
routing table, than might otherwise exist without multihoming.
