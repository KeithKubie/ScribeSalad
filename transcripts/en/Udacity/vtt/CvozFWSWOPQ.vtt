00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.054
Well, we know Janet's time is equal to Rohan's time.

00:00:04.054 --> 00:00:07.753
So we just set these two expressions equal 
to each other.

00:00:07.753 --> 00:00:10.158
Now this is a really powerful concept.

00:00:10.158 --> 00:00:13.015
We were able to use a variable for Janet's speed,

00:00:13.015 --> 00:00:14.923
relate all this other information,

00:00:14.923 --> 00:00:19.513
to come up with an equation relating the time 
for both Janet and Rohan.

00:00:19.513 --> 00:00:22.532
This is why it's so important when you tackle 
motion problems,

00:00:22.532 --> 00:00:25.273
it's best to organize your information in a chart.

00:00:25.273 --> 00:00:28.471
See if you can find relationships between 
the variables

00:00:28.471 --> 00:00:30.448
and any numbers that you are given.

00:00:30.448 --> 00:00:34.190
In our case, we knew that Janet and Rohan took the same amount of time

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.719
to get to LAx.

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:39.685
So we can set this time equal to this time.
