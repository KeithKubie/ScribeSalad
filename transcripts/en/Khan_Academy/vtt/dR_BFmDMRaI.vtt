00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.330
In the first video on evolution,
I gave the example

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.170
of the peppered moth during the
Industrial Revolution in

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.630
England and how, before the
Industrial Revolution, there

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.920
were a bunch of moths: some were
dark, some were light,

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:12.910
some were in between.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.309
But then once everything became
soot filled, all of a

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.160
sudden, the dark moths were less
likely to be caught by

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.260
predators and so all of the
white moths were less likely

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.060
to be able to reproduce
successfully, so the black

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.140
moth trait, or that variant,
dominated.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.600
And then if you came a little
bit later and you saw all the

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.850
moths had turned black,
you'd say all

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.070
these moths are geniuses.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.760
They appear to have somehow
engineered their way to stay

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.680
camouflaged.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.060
And the point I was making
there is that, look, that

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.060
wasn't engineered or an explicit
move on the part of

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.090
the moths or the DNA, that was
just a natural byproduct of

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.000
them having some variation, and
some of that variation was

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.080
selected for.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.850
So that example, that was pretty
simple: black or white.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.200
But what about more complicated
things?

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.600
So, for example, here I've got a
couple of pictures of what's

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.319
commonly called the
owl butterfly.

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:06.790
And what's amazing here, and
it's pretty obvious, as I

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.750
probably don't have to point out
to you, is its wing looks

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.370
like half of an owl's eye.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.980
I can almost draw a beak here
and draw another wing there

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.400
and you can imagine an owl
staring at us, right?

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.310
And here, too, I could imagine
a beak here and you would

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.170
think an owl there, too.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.880
And so the question is how does
something this good show

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.890
up randomly, right?

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.840
I mean, you could imagine, OK,
little spots or black and

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.630
white or grey, but how does
something that looks so much

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.360
like an eye generate randomly?

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.430
Now the answer is-- well,
there's a couple of answers.

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.820
One is why does this eye
exist, or this eye-like

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.960
pattern or this owl-like
eye's pattern?

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.500
And there, the jury's
still out on that.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.270
I read a little bit about it on
Wikipedia and all of these

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.540
images I got from Wikipedia.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.950
In Wikipedia, they said,
look, there's two

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:00.970
competing theories here.

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.060
One theory is that this, even
though to us humans, the way

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.690
we see things, it looks like
an owl's eye, that this is

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.830
actually a decoy.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:16.610
When some predator wants to eat
one of these things, they

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.870
go for the thing that looks
most substantive.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.000
So instead of going for the
butterfly's body, which

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.350
doesn't look that substantive,
they go for

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:25.250
the big, black thing.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.330
They say, oh, that looks like
it's protein rich and it'll be

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.160
a good meal.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.310
So they try to snap and bite at
that, and if they bite at

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.440
that, sure, the guy's wing's
going to be clipped a little

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.840
bit and it's going to suck,
but the animal itself, the

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.540
actual butterfly, would survive,
and maybe it can

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.320
repair its swings.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.110
I don't know the actual biology
of the owl butterfly.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.710
That's one theory, and then the
argument against it goes,

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.090
well, no, if that was the case,
then you would want the

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.070
black spot even further back
along its-- you'd want the

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.980
spot way far away
from the body.

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.280
You'd want it back here instead
of right here, because

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.540
there's still a chance, if
something chomps at this

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.780
little black spot, that
it'll still get the

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.750
abdomen of the butterfly.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.160
Now, the other theory as to
why this exists-- and, you

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.710
know, who knows?

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:09.870
Maybe it's a little
bit of both.

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.000
Maybe both of these are true.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.960
Maybe this offers
two advantages.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.510
The other theory, and this is
kind of the one that jumps out

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.780
at us when we see this , is,
hey, this looks like an owl.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.980
Maybe this is to scare away the
things that are likely to

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.400
eat this dude.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.440
And it does turn out in my
reading that there are lizards

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.120
that like to eat these type of
butterflies, and those lizards

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.470
probably don't like to be around
birds or owls because

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.780
those owls eat them, so that
might be a deterrent.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.360
And then the other example, they
said is, look, they tend

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.370
to be eaten by this lizard
right here-- this is what

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.740
Wikipedia told me-- and that
this lizard tends to be eaten

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.850
by this frog right there, and
that the eyes of this

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.660
butterfly are not too
dissimilar to the

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.070
eyes of this frog.

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.080
And, you know, we can debate
whether or not that's the

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.050
case, and if this was the
predator we're trying to

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:59.350
mimic, you could make an
argument that maybe we would

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.620
have had more green on our wing,
but that's not the point

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:02.210
of this video.

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.540
But it's a fun discussion to
have as to what is useful

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:06.140
about this eye.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.270
But let's have the question: How
did that eye come about?

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.350
And when I say that eye, I mean
the pattern on that wing.

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.980
What set of events allowed
this to happen?

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.709
Because when I described
evolution, and we know that

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.610
everything in our biological
kingdom is just a set of

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:23.540
proteins and then stuff that
maybe the protein-- but mainly

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.920
protein, and that protein's
all coded for by DNA.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.310
I'm going to do future videos
on DNA, but DNA is just a

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.690
sequence of base pairs.

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.420
It's a sequence of
these molecules.

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.630
And we represent adenine,
and guanine and

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:37.910
cytosine and thymine.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.460
Then maybe you have a couple of
adenines in a row and some

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:41.760
guanine and thymine.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.840
I'll do a lot more on this in
the future, but the idea is

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.580
it's just coded for by this
sequence of these molecules.

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.010
How do you go from a butterfly
that has no eye to all of a

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.100
sudden an eye that goes there?

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.470
Obviously, just one change
that happens

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:56.570
from a random mutation.

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:01.380
Maybe that G turns into an A or
maybe this C and this T get

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.650
deleted so everything-- that
alone isn't going to develop

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.580
this beautiful of a pattern or
this useful of a pattern.

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.880
So how do the random
changes explain

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.030
something that's this intricate?

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.190
And this is my explanation.

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.840
And obviously, I wasn't sitting
there watching over

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.420
the thousands or millions of
years as these owl butterflies

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.520
emerged, so this is just my
theory of how natural

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.330
selection does explain this
type of phenomenon.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.780
You have a world where in some
environment you have

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.980
butterflies, and their wings
look like-- let's say you have

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.930
some butterflies that are
generally like this.

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.006
That's their wing, and it's a
very bad drawing, but I think

00:05:42.006 --> 00:05:44.290
you get the idea, and there's
just some general patterns.

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:45.170
We've seen it before.

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:47.080
There's variation.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.220
And the variation does show up
from these little random

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:51.390
changes in DNA.

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:52.920
I think we can all believe
that, that most of these

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.180
changes are kind of benign.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.150
Maybe they just set up
differently where a little

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.730
pattern will show up or a little
speck of pigment will

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:01.630
show up with a slightly
different color.

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:03.470
And we even see amongst
these owl

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.030
butterflies, there is variation.

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:07.670
This dude's wing is different
than that guy's wing with the

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:10.040
commonality that they do have
these eye-looking shapes.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.680
And there's not just one;
there's actually multiple.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.610
This guy has this other thing
up here that looks

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.110
interesting, and they have
multiple things, but the one

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:20.830
really noticeable feature is
this eye-looking thing.

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.400
So how do we go from this
to an eye-looking thing?

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.080
So the idea is you have
some variation.

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.070
One guy might look like that.

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:33.630
Another guy, or gal, might--
just randomly, their dot might

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:35.410
be something like that.

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:39.520
Another gal or guy-- these wings
are really badly drawn,

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:40.730
but you get the idea.

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:41.450
This is the butterfly.

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.670
This is its antenna
right there.

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:45.290
That's its body.

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:52.850
Another butterfly's patterns
might look like this, right?

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:54.640
And so, they're just random.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.760
But when they go into a certain
environment for

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.250
whatever reason, maybe one of
its predators-- maybe that

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:02.190
theory that these are supposed
to look like eyes is true.

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:04.750
And so, actually, maybe
this guy just has a

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:08.120
random pattern here.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.830
And so this guy-- and I'm not
saying that it's like

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:11.980
definitely better.

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:16.080
They're both going to be found
and killed by predators, but

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.380
it's all probablistic, right?

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:22.270
Maybe this guy has a 1% less
chance of getting a predator,

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:24.475
because when a predator just
looks at him out of the corner

00:07:24.475 --> 00:07:28.220
of that eye, that little really
hazy region kind of

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:30.470
looks like an eye and the
predator would be better off

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:32.480
just not messing with it, and
they'd rather go after the

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.740
dude that looks like this.

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:35.670
So it's just a slight
probability.

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:37.520
Now, you might, say, OK,
what's 1% going to do?

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.990
But when you compound that 1%
over thousands and thousands

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:44.930
of generations, all of a sudden,
this trait might

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:48.590
dominate because he's just going
to be killed that less

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:50.680
frequently, 1% less
frequently.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:54.220
Now, maybe this guy has a
similar trait, but his spot is

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:55.430
closer to the abdomen.

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:59.010
And here, it's a tradeoff,
because maybe some predators

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:01.950
get scared away by this
concentration of pigment.

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:05.310
And once again, I'm not saying
that we're here yet.

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:07.920
We're not at this very advanced,
sophisticated

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:08.460
pattern yet.

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:11.070
We're at this random
concentration of pigment that

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:12.000
just shows up.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.570
So we see that people who have
this concentration of pigment

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:17.050
further away from their
abdomen, they do well.

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:19.330
But when it's too close, maybe
some predators think that

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:21.290
that's actually an insect and
they want to eat it, so that's

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:24.640
actually a bad trait.

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.420
So what happens is this guy
dominates, and so within this

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:30.470
population, you start having a
lot of variation, because he

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:33.620
starts representing--
he's more likely to

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:34.789
pass on these traits.

00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:37.340
And I want to make that
point very clear.

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:39.049
This isn't what happens
over the course

00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:40.440
of an animal's lifetime.

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:43.100
It's not like if somehow I
experience something, or at

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:45.970
least our current theory if I
experience something, that I

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:48.920
could somehow pass on that
knowledge to my child.

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:53.570
What it says is if my DNA just
happens to have just some

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:57.690
variation that happens to be
more useful or more likely for

00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:00.540
me to survive to reproduction
and for my children to

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:03.660
survive, then that will start to
dominate in the population.

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:05.490
So then the population, you're
going to have variations

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:06.750
within that.

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:09.345
Maybe some guys, you know, it's
going to get a little bit

00:09:09.345 --> 00:09:10.520
to look like that.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:14.070
Maybe another one's going to
look a little bit like that.

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:15.400
Maybe it has some spots there.

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:19.190
You can kind of view it as the
variation as "exploring." But

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:21.680
I want to be very clear not to
use any active verbs here

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:26.630
because this is all being done
really as almost a common

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:28.690
sense process, where
everything changes.

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:30.890
The changes that are most suited
are the ones that are

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:32.350
going to survive more
frequently.

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:34.360
And then the next generation's
going to have more of that and

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:37.550
then you'll have variation
within that change.

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:39.500
And then this one might
be like that, and

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.270
maybe this is the one.

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:43.540
These were good compared to
that, but now when you're

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:47.660
competing amongst themselves,
this one is able to reproduce

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:51.410
1% more than this
guy or this guy.

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:54.240
And so this guy becomes-- and
maybe it's some combination of

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:55.520
all of the above, and
they mix and match.

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:57.620
It's a hugely complex system.

00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:00.360
But then this guy represents
most of the population, when I

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:03.790
say this guy, I'm saying this
guy's genetic information, at

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:06.060
least as it pertains
to his wings.

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:07.850
And then you get variation
amongst that.

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:10.790
Maybe some of it, they have a
little small dot and there's

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:11.830
some dots around it.

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:14.110
Maybe it's like this.

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:16.630
Maybe one of them digresses and
goes back here, but then

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:19.890
he has trouble competing so
he gets knocked out again.

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:22.060
And then some other people
have it back here.

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:23.660
I think you get the
point that this

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:24.920
isn't happening overnight.

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:30.310
These changes can be fairly
incremental, but we're doing

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:32.330
it over thousands
of generations.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:34.590
So when you're talking about
thousands of generations, or

00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:38.600
even millions of generations,
even a 1% advantage can be

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.450
significant, and when you
accumulate those variations

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:45.340
over a large period of time,
you can get to fairly

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:47.550
intricate patterns like this.

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:49.960
So I just wanted to explain
that, because this is often

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:53.820
used as, sure, I can believe
the butterfly moth or I can

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:57.310
even maybe believe the examples
of the antibiotics

00:10:57.310 --> 00:11:00.290
and the bacteria or the flu,
because those are kind of

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:01.130
real-time examples.

00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:02.950
But how does something this
intricate show up?

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:05.280
And I actually want to
make a point here.

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:07.430
We think this is more intricate
because we can

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:09.410
relate to it in our
everyday lives.

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:12.500
But if you actually look at a
structure of a bacteria and

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:15.860
how it operates or what a virus
does to infiltrate an

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:18.830
immune system or a cell, that's
actually on a lot more

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:21.680
levels a lot more intricate
than a design.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.770
In fact, the whole reason why
I'm using this as an example

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:28.130
is because this is a fairly
simple example as opposed to

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:30.300
kind of explaining the
metabolism of a certain type

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:32.500
of bacteria and how that might
change and how it might become

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:34.510
immune to penicillin
or whatever else.

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:36.840
But I want to make this very
clear that these very

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.210
intricate things, they don't
happen overnight.

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:45.410
It's not like one butterfly
was completely one uniform

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:48.080
hot-pink color and then all of
a sudden they have a child

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.820
whose wings looked
just like this.

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:50.120
No!

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.500
It happens over large periods of
time, although there might

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:54.880
be some little weird hormonal
change that does this, but I'm

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.740
not going to go there,
but that is possible.

00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:59.570
But I just wanted to make this
point because I think the more

00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:02.630
examples we see, the more it'll
kind of hit home that

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:04.900
this is a passive process.

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:08.100
We're not talking about these
things happening overnight.

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:12.070
And it's actually really
interesting to look at our

00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:15.070
world around us and look at
ecosystems as they are today

00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:18.040
and try to think really hard
about how something came to

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.580
be, what it's useful for,
why it might have

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:21.630
been selected for.

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:27.430
For example, are traits that
occur after reproduction

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:28.070
selected for?

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:30.860
Well, probably not unless they
affect the reproduction of the

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:31.600
next cycle.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.220
For example, you might say,
oh, well, the trait to be

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:37.590
nurturing after your
reproductive years, that's

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:38.620
after reproductive years.

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:43.460
No, but it helps your
offspring reproduce.

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:47.030
But we already see a lot of
diseases, especially once we

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:50.800
get beyond our reproductive and
our child-rearing years.

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.280
So once we get into our fifties
and sixties, the

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:57.120
incidences of diseases increases
exponentially from

00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:58.940
when we're younger and because
they're no longer being

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:03.020
selected for, because it no
longer affects our ability to

00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:04.890
reproduce, because we've
already reproduced.

00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:06.220
We've already raised
our children so

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:07.330
that they could reproduce.

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:10.140
So the only thing that happens
at that point is now not being

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:11.000
selected for.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.790
So anyway, hopefully, this video
will give you a little

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:15.160
bit more nuance on evolution,
and I want to do a couple of

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.670
videos like this, because I
really want to make it clear

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:20.510
that it's not making some wild
claim that all of a sudden

00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:23.660
this appears spontaneously, that
it really is a thing that

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:27.750
happens over millennia and
eons and very gradually.
