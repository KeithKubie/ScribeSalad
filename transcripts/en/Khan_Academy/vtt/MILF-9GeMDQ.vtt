00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.900
I think you'll find this video
exciting because until now,

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.420
we've just been talking about
the Federal reserve in the

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.950
abstract and I was drawing
little boxes to represent

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.830
balance sheets, but this is
the actual Federal reserve

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.510
balance sheet and I took a date
that was before all of

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.390
this silliness started happening
in the banking

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.340
sector just so we could kind of
see what a Federal reserve

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.660
balance would've looked like
in a normal environment.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.780
And then we can actually, in
future videos, compare what

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.580
they've done since then and
then we can get a better

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.500
insight into all of the
different machinations that

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.370
the Federal reserve has done to
kind of try to keep banks

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.900
liquid and solvent and to
keep everything going.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.320
And we can debate whether
they've been good or bad or

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.260
they're just keeping banks
in kind of zombie mode.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.225
But anyway, this is the Federal
reserve's balance

00:00:43.225 --> 00:00:48.200
sheet as of February
14th, 2007.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.140
So before all the craziness
happened, although a little

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.530
bit started-- this is before the
Feds started taking really

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.350
aggressive action to provide
liquidity for the markets.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.000
But here the assets.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.900
So first of all, we have the
total assets number.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.410
That's just interesting
to look at.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:03.240
These are all in millions.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.660
So this is $871 billion
of assets.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:08.910
Let's just get the
big picture.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.830
Let me draw that here in our
traditional box diagram.

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:23.020
So if I were to draw the
assets-- the sum of all the

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:30.160
assets over here is $871
billion, and we know that the

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.715
liabilities plus equity better
add up to $871 billion.

00:01:33.715 --> 00:01:34.280
Let's see.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.540
What's the total liabilities?

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.800
Total liabilities is
$839 billion-- so

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.260
give or take $840.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.720
So the liabilities-- I'll do
it in a different color.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.420
The liabilities are $840
billion, give or

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.940
take a little bit.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.540
They should have the same width,
not that the width

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.790
matters that much.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.360
And then whatever's left over
should be equity, right?

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.400
Assets minus liabilities.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.690
What you have minus what you owe
is what you're left with

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.130
for the owners.

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.130
And of course, owners of the
Federal reserve, you kind of

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.620
have to take with
a grain of salt.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.620
They really don't have the
upside of traditional owners.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.480
They're really just kind
of stakeholders.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.060
What's left over
is the equity.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.220
It should be roughly
$31 billion.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.790
And let's confirm that
by looking at the

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.330
actual balance sheet.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.890
And here we have it-- total
capital is $31 billion.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.310
So big picture, so far it's kind
of meeting up with how

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.770
we've envisioned a Federal
reserve balance sheet, but

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.170
let's dig a little deeper and
see if we can find interesting

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.740
things and things we've
talked about.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.480
And hopefully at this point,
we should actually

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.830
understand all of it.

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.450
Let's focus on the
assets for now.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.160
So the assets are just
this part of it.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.670
OK.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.580
So it has-- this is what?

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.820
This is $11 billion of gold
certificate accounts and

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.000
that's some type of
rights on gold.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.220
Let's see.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.380
Gold certificate accounts.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.960
Let's see if they have any
other gold anywhere.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.660
Coin-- $1 billion.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.570
But this is all small
potatoes, right?

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.620
I don't know what special
drawing rights certificate

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.750
account is, but it's very
small relative to

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:18.630
the big pie, right?

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.830
There's $871 billion
of assets.

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.310
This is just kind of almost
rounding-off error.

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.690
Here we have a big chunk
of something.

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.750
Actually, I think this $11
billion is actual gold because

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.860
I don't see it anywhere
else on their assets.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.300
So I think if you combine
roughly-- I don't know what

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.680
this thing here is, but if you
combine this and this, it's

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.920
saying that the Federal reserve
is-- because I don't

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.100
see gold anywhere else here--
that it's holding roughly $12

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.360
billion worth of gold, which
really isn't a lot of gold

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.670
when you consider the total
size of its balance sheet.

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:56.070
The big piece right here-- let
me pick a different color.

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.700
I'll do it in the purple.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:04.030
It has securities, repurchase
agreements, and loans-- $808

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.090
billion-- almost $809 billion.

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.060
So this is a big piece of
the Fed's balance sheet.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.760
Out of the whole $871, $808.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.149
So pretty much it's almost
like that much of it.

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:19.100
Actually, maybe a little bit
less of that-- are these

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.459
securities and things
like that.

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.540
Let's see what kind of
securities they have. And they

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:23.340
break them down.

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:31.090
So this $808 billion is made up
of these things right here.

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.340
The bulk of them are U.S.
treasury loans, right?

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.140
So these are going to be bills,
notes, and bonds-- OK.

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.620
So just to explain, a treasury
bill-- and I've done videos on

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.820
this-- this is essentially a
loan to the government for a

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.040
year or less.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.760
So it's just a loan to the
government that matures in a

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.570
year or in three months.

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.560
Notes and bonds-- these are
loans to the U.S. treasury

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.820
that have longer maturities.

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.430
Notes are up to 10 years.

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.650
Bonds are more than 10 years.

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.833
And then inflation index bonds--
I'll do a whole video

00:05:00.833 --> 00:05:02.490
on that in the future, but
these are essentially

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.250
treasuries that are indexed to
inflation so you can kind of

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:06.770
hedge out a little bit of
your inflation risk.

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.770
But, needless to say, the big
picture is is that $780

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.970
billion of the Fed's assets are
treasuries, loans to the

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:15.790
Federal government.

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:16.710
Let me draw that here.

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:22.420
So a pretty big piece, roughly
that much is treasury.

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:26.060
So most of what the Federal
reserve owns are treasuries.

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.040
And that's consistent with
everything we've gone over so

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.960
far and that account for
everything up to here.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.740
And then what's interesting--
what we just talked about--

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.580
repurchase agreements,
$30 billion.

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.940
And I don't know 100%, but I'm
guessing that these are--

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.270
someone came to the discount
window and essentially

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.480
borrowed $30 billion
from the Fed-- and

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.290
it's not just someone.

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:50.780
It's probably multiple people
came and borrowed $30 billion

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.890
from the Fed-- and they gave
treasuries as collateral, but

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:56.355
as we know, just the way
repurchase agreements work,

00:05:56.355 --> 00:05:59.330
they actually kind of sold the
treasuries to the Fed and the

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:00.920
Fed agreed to buy it later,
but it's essentially

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:01.880
collateral.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.180
So these repurchase agreements--
they're included

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.090
in these securities because
they're not

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:09.010
just agreements, right?

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:11.770
They actually are-- they're
probably treasuries or they

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.070
might be other types of highly
rated securities and we'll

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:16.700
learn in future videos that
the Fed has lowered its

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.900
standards over the last year
in terms of what type of

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.030
collateral or what type of
securities it's willing to

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:26.530
trade in these repurchase
agreements, but in the

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:28.590
situation it looks like
about $30 billion.

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:31.400
And you can also-- you get
a clue of what repurchase

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.820
agreements are because here,
they say securities held

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.000
outright, right?

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.030
So there's no repurchase
agreement.

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:40.660
There's not some contract where
they say they're going

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:43.370
to sell this to someone
else at another price.

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:44.740
These are repurchase
agreements.

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.900
These are kind of more
collateral for loans.

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.650
And then they have outright
loans-- $39 million.

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:51.040
That's pretty much peanuts in
the Federal reserve world.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.420
So the bulk is treasuries, a
little bit of repurchase

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:56.940
agreements, and then there's
other assets.

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:58.090
They don't break out
what this is.

00:06:58.090 --> 00:06:59.250
Maybe there's some
gold in that.

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:00.620
I'm not sure.

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.800
Bank premises, the buildings
of the Federal reserve are

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:04.810
worth $2 billion.

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:06.970
I mean, they have 12 banks
around the country and I'm

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:08.770
sure they have a bunch
of other things.

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:10.820
And then items in process
collection.

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.030
I don't know what these
things are, but these

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:12.940
are all small potatoes.

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:15.600
The big thing is that the
Federal reserve's assets are

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.470
predominantly U.S. treasuries--
at least, they're

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:19.700
predominantly treasuries
right now.

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.360
Now let's look at
the liabilities.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.010
And to some degree, this is
much more interesting.

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:27.220
So Federal reserve notes,
net of Federal

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:28.830
reserve bank holdings.

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:36.400
So $769 billion.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.540
So when I talked about
notes outstanding,

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:39.820
that's what this is.

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:43.620
These are Federal reserve notes
that have been printed

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:44.950
and they're liabilities,
right?

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:48.670
Because the Federal reserve bank
printed these notes and

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:51.000
then used them as currency and
so they're liabilities now

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.830
because someone can come back
another time and say, hey,

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:58.220
give me back the value of these
things and that's a bit

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:02.880
of an abstract concept, but
roughly $700 something of this

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:04.020
are notes outstanding.

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:08.040
This is money that the Federal
reserve had printed.

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.880
And then there's some reverse
repurchase agreements, which

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.310
essentially-- see for some
reason, the Federal reserve

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:16.850
used repurchase agreements to
borrow from someone else.

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:19.840
It has a little bit of
deposits, right?

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.370
And these deposits have actually
grown dramatically in

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:23.080
the past year.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:24.730
Has $22 billion of deposits.

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:27.630
So these are actually deposits
that banks are keeping with

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:29.320
the Federal reserve.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:32.090
The U.S. treasury actually
keeps some money there.

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:35.390
Depository institutions have
$17 billion-- and actually,

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:37.480
that's how the Federal
reserve traditionally

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:39.360
has paid its expenses.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.490
People put deposits with the
Federal reserve-- so let's say

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:43.750
these are deposits from banks.

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:45.230
It's a very small piece.

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:47.960
It's like $17 billion.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:51.070
These could be deposits from
member banks, but the Federal

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:53.770
reserve does not pay interest
in these deposits.

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:56.000
They don't pay interest on these
deposits and then they

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.290
can take these deposits and by
treasuries or other securities

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:00.630
and get interest on them.

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:02.740
So they're essentially getting
free interest and that's what

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:05.030
they used actually to fund
their operations.

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:07.750
Any excess after funding their
operations goes back to the

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:11.420
U.S. Treasury so it's not like
Ben Bernanke can fly around or

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:13.450
drive a Bentley or something.

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:15.820
And then I don't know what this
is-- foreign official--

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:19.880
these are nothing items. So the
bulk of it is money that

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:22.050
had been printed and that's
a liability of the Federal

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:23.020
reserve now.

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:25.980
And then there's a little bit
of deposits from depository

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:26.850
institutions.

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:28.520
And the treasury has kept
some money with the

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.030
Federal reserve as well.

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:33.660
And then everything left
over is the equity.

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:35.880
Anyway, I thought that would be
pretty neat to see that you

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.910
can actually look at what the
Federal reserve's balance

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:38.520
sheet is right now.

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:39.870
You can actually just do
a web search for it.

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:41.790
You'll find it in a bunch
of different sources.

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:43.420
And you can actually
analyze it.

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:46.790
You now have the tools to look
at that and make sense of it.

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:49.970
And what's even more interesting
is to compare this

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:52.730
balance sheet with the current
Federal reserve balance sheet

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:53.960
and then you can know
everything that

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.860
they've been up to.
