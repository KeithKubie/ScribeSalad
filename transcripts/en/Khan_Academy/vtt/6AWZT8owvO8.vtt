00:00:00.347 --> 00:00:02.556
- [Voiceover] In the last
video we introduced the idea

00:00:02.556 --> 00:00:05.740
that we could represent any
arbitrary, periodic function

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.240
by a series of weighted cosines and sines.

00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:12.861
And what I'm gonna start
doing in this video,

00:00:12.861 --> 00:00:16.143
is starting to establish
our mathematical foundation.

00:00:16.143 --> 00:00:19.376
So it'll be pretty
straightforward for us to find

00:00:19.376 --> 00:00:23.444
these coefficients that
give us that function.

00:00:23.444 --> 00:00:26.233
So the first thing I
wanna do, the first thing

00:00:26.233 --> 00:00:30.199
I'm gonna do is establish
some truths using,

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:32.584
or some truths with
the definite integrals.

00:00:32.584 --> 00:00:35.069
I'm gonna focus over
the intervals zero to pi

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:37.312
over this video and the next few videos

00:00:37.312 --> 00:00:39.332
because the function we're approximating

00:00:39.332 --> 00:00:41.472
has a period of two
pi, completes one cycle

00:00:41.472 --> 00:00:43.709
from zero to two pi, we
could've done it over

00:00:43.709 --> 00:00:46.712
other intervals of length two pi,

00:00:46.712 --> 00:00:49.168
and if this period was other than two pi,

00:00:49.168 --> 00:00:51.256
we would've done it over
intervals of that period,

00:00:51.256 --> 00:00:53.344
but I'm focusing on two pi
because it makes the math

00:00:53.344 --> 00:00:55.009
a little bit cleaner,
a little bit simpler,

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:57.545
and then we can generalize in the future.

00:00:57.545 --> 00:01:00.647
So let's just establish some things about

00:01:00.647 --> 00:01:03.781
definite integrals of trig functions.

00:01:03.781 --> 00:01:06.094
So the first I wanna establish,

00:01:06.094 --> 00:01:08.430
I wanna establish that
the definite integral

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.597
from zero to two pi of sine of mx, dx,

00:01:15.532 --> 00:01:17.787
actually let me stay in t, since our

00:01:17.787 --> 00:01:20.302
original function is in terms of t.

00:01:20.302 --> 00:01:24.469
Sine of mt, dt, I wanna establish
that that is equal to zero

00:01:25.681 --> 00:01:27.931
for any non-zero integer m.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.640
For non-zero, non-zero integer, integer m,

00:01:39.176 --> 00:01:41.467
and I also wanna establish
that the integral

00:01:41.467 --> 00:01:45.634
from zero to two pi of cosine
of mt, dt, is equal to zero

00:01:49.583 --> 00:01:51.833
for any non-zero integer m.

00:01:52.902 --> 00:01:55.453
And you might already
take this for granted

00:01:55.453 --> 00:01:57.195
or you feel good about it,
or you've already proven it

00:01:57.195 --> 00:02:00.391
to yourself, and if so, you
could actually skip this video.

00:02:00.391 --> 00:02:02.261
But let's work through
it, 'cause it's actually

00:02:02.261 --> 00:02:05.689
a good review of some
integral calculus here.

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:07.809
So let's first do this top one,

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:09.382
so let me just re-write the integral.

00:02:09.382 --> 00:02:12.392
So we're gonna take the
integral from zero to two pi

00:02:12.392 --> 00:02:15.809
of sine mt, dt, now we know we won't take

00:02:19.665 --> 00:02:21.721
the antiderivative of sine of mt,

00:02:21.721 --> 00:02:24.933
so we know that the derivative

00:02:24.933 --> 00:02:28.600
with respect to t of
cosine mt, is equal to,

00:02:32.616 --> 00:02:35.710
what is this, this is
going to be equal to m.

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.170
The derivative of mt with respect to t

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.990
times the derivative of
cosine mt with respect to mt.

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.907
So times negative sine
of mt, or we could write

00:02:49.208 --> 00:02:51.371
this is gonna be equal to negative m

00:02:51.371 --> 00:02:55.538
sine of mt, and I could put a
parentheses there if I like.

00:02:57.062 --> 00:02:59.696
And so I almost have
negative m sine of mt,

00:02:59.696 --> 00:03:01.343
I just wanna have a negative m here.

00:03:01.343 --> 00:03:03.213
So what if I put a negative m there,

00:03:03.213 --> 00:03:05.004
but I can't just do that,
that would change the value

00:03:05.004 --> 00:03:08.531
of the expression, but
I could also multiply

00:03:08.531 --> 00:03:10.655
by negative one over m.

00:03:10.655 --> 00:03:12.824
Now these two would,
if we take the product

00:03:12.824 --> 00:03:13.852
they're gonna cancel out,

00:03:13.852 --> 00:03:15.587
we're gonna get our original expression.

00:03:15.587 --> 00:03:17.288
But this is useful because now we can say

00:03:17.288 --> 00:03:20.141
this is equal to negative one over m

00:03:20.141 --> 00:03:23.189
and now the antiderivative
of this business

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:25.941
right over here, we know is cosine mt.

00:03:25.941 --> 00:03:29.108
So it's gonna be cosine mt, cosine mt,

00:03:30.348 --> 00:03:34.098
evaluated at two pi and
zero, two pi and zero

00:03:36.348 --> 00:03:39.207
and so this is going to be equal to,

00:03:39.207 --> 00:03:42.207
this is equal to negative one over m

00:03:44.077 --> 00:03:47.994
times cosine of m times
two pi, right this way,

00:03:50.033 --> 00:03:52.700
cosine, cosine of m times two pi

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.883
minus cosine of, well it's
gonna be m times zero,

00:04:02.118 --> 00:04:05.455
which is just gonna be, we
can just write that as zero.

00:04:05.455 --> 00:04:09.998
And so let's see, cosine
of any multiple of two pi,

00:04:09.998 --> 00:04:12.078
well that's just gonna be one,

00:04:12.078 --> 00:04:14.398
and cosine of zero, well that's also one.

00:04:14.398 --> 00:04:16.174
So you have one minus one is zero,

00:04:16.174 --> 00:04:19.528
times negative one over
m, well this is all

00:04:19.528 --> 00:04:23.533
going to evaluate to the result we wanted,

00:04:23.533 --> 00:04:25.996
this is all going to evaluate to zero.

00:04:25.996 --> 00:04:29.440
So we have just proven
that first statement,

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.741
so now let's prove the second one.

00:04:30.741 --> 00:04:34.674
It's gonna be a very similar
argument, so let's re-write it.

00:04:34.674 --> 00:04:38.200
We're gonna get the
integral from zero to two pi

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.117
of cosine of mt, dt, and now let me

00:04:45.484 --> 00:04:47.396
engineer this a little
bit, we know that the

00:04:47.396 --> 00:04:51.500
derivative of sine of mt is m cosine mt,

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.372
so let me multiply and divide by m,

00:04:54.372 --> 00:04:56.783
and we multiply by an
m and divide by an m,

00:04:56.783 --> 00:04:58.565
not changing the actual value,

00:04:58.565 --> 00:05:01.595
and so this is going to
be equal to one over m,

00:05:01.595 --> 00:05:04.178
and then the antiderivative of,

00:05:05.147 --> 00:05:06.111
let me find a nice color here,

00:05:06.111 --> 00:05:09.115
the antiderivative of
that right over there,

00:05:09.115 --> 00:05:11.652
that should say, the
antiderivative of this

00:05:11.652 --> 00:05:15.402
right over here is sine
of mt, so sine of mt.

00:05:19.374 --> 00:05:22.865
Notice the derivative of
sine of mt is m cosine mt,

00:05:22.865 --> 00:05:25.907
and we're going to evaluate that at

00:05:25.907 --> 00:05:29.334
from zero to two pi, so this
is going to be equal to,

00:05:29.334 --> 00:05:31.747
we still have our one over m out front,

00:05:31.747 --> 00:05:34.914
one over m, and so this is going to be

00:05:35.877 --> 00:05:39.960
sine of m times two pi,
or we could say two pi m,

00:05:41.931 --> 00:05:45.815
two pi m, minus sine of m times zero,

00:05:45.815 --> 00:05:49.692
so sine, we can just write
that as sine of zero,

00:05:49.692 --> 00:05:51.760
and what's the sine of
any multiple of two pi.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.663
Remember m is a non-zero integer,

00:05:53.663 --> 00:05:56.187
so any multiple that's gonna
be a multiple of two pi here,

00:05:56.187 --> 00:05:57.769
well that's just going to be zero,

00:05:57.769 --> 00:05:59.682
and sine of zero is just going to be zero,

00:05:59.682 --> 00:06:01.411
so this whole thing, this whole thing

00:06:01.411 --> 00:06:03.993
is just going to be zero,
and so we have established

00:06:03.993 --> 00:06:05.590
our second statement there.

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:08.879
So this is going to be a
nice base to build from,

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:13.208
and now we're going to do
slightly more complex integrals

00:06:13.208 --> 00:06:14.732
in the next few videos,
so there's gonna be

00:06:14.732 --> 00:06:19.235
hopefully pretty straightforward
to find our Fourier coefficients

00:06:19.235 --> 00:06:23.402
with a little bit of calculus
and algebraic manipulation.
