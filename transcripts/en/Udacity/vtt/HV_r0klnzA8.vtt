00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
And let's look at this--if x=0 then y=0. So he has to go through the origin.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Let's takes out the red hypothesis over here.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Now if x=2, then y is 4. That means the line goes to the point 2, 4 and of course, 1, 2.

00:00:19.000 --> 99:59:59.000
That makes the green line the correct choice here.
