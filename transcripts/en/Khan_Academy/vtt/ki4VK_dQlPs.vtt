00:00:00.393 --> 00:00:01.936
- [Voiceover] We've been
doing several videos now

00:00:01.936 --> 00:00:05.907
to establish a bunch of
truths of definite integrals

00:00:05.907 --> 00:00:09.588
of various combinations
of trigonometric functions

00:00:09.588 --> 00:00:12.585
so that we will have a really
strong mathematical basis

00:00:12.585 --> 00:00:15.353
for actually finding
the fourier coefficients

00:00:15.353 --> 00:00:17.469
and I think we only have
one more video to go.

00:00:17.469 --> 00:00:19.878
In the last video, we said hey,
if you take any combinations

00:00:19.878 --> 00:00:24.061
of signs where M and N
are integers that either

00:00:24.061 --> 00:00:25.527
don't equal each other or don't equal

00:00:25.527 --> 00:00:27.203
the negative each other,
then you're gonna get that,

00:00:27.203 --> 00:00:28.932
integrals gonna be equal to zero

00:00:28.932 --> 00:00:30.425
and then if they did equal to each other,

00:00:30.425 --> 00:00:32.931
well it's just gonna be the
same thing as sine squared

00:00:32.931 --> 00:00:36.082
of some multiple of T
and then that actually

00:00:36.082 --> 00:00:38.177
over the interval from zero to two pi

00:00:38.177 --> 00:00:40.137
is going to be equal to pi.

00:00:40.137 --> 00:00:43.196
Just to be clear, I wasn't
as clear as I should've been

00:00:43.196 --> 00:00:45.077
in the last video, this
is going to be true

00:00:45.077 --> 00:00:48.232
where M is a non zero integer.

00:00:48.232 --> 00:00:50.953
If M was zero, then the
inside of this integral

00:00:50.953 --> 00:00:52.942
would just simplify the zero

00:00:52.942 --> 00:00:54.477
and then the integral would be zero.

00:00:54.477 --> 00:00:56.060
So M has to be

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:57.560
a non-zero integer

00:00:59.251 --> 00:01:02.270
for this right over here to be true.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:03.492
Now what we want to do in this video

00:01:03.492 --> 00:01:05.667
is do the same thing we
did in the last video

00:01:05.667 --> 00:01:09.657
but now do it for cosines but
the product of two cosines

00:01:09.657 --> 00:01:12.742
where M and N are different integers

00:01:12.742 --> 00:01:14.759
or they're not the negative of each other,

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:18.392
that's going to be zero, but
they are the same integer

00:01:18.392 --> 00:01:21.336
and they are not zero
so that will boil down

00:01:21.336 --> 00:01:24.795
to cosine square of MT then
that is going to be equaled,

00:01:24.795 --> 00:01:28.005
this definite integral, is
going to be equal to pi.

00:01:28.005 --> 00:01:29.020
We're gonna do it the same way that

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.519
we did it with the signs
we are going to use

00:01:31.519 --> 00:01:33.150
some of our trigonometric,

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.565
some of our trigonometric identities

00:01:35.565 --> 00:01:39.217
and so let's rewrite, let's
rewrite this right over here.

00:01:39.217 --> 00:01:42.158
What we're trying to take the integral of

00:01:42.158 --> 00:01:46.325
and so this is going to be the
integral from zero to two pi

00:01:47.633 --> 00:01:49.966
so cosine MT times cosine NT

00:01:51.355 --> 00:01:54.068
using a product to sum trig identity.

00:01:54.068 --> 00:01:55.160
Now if this is unfamiliar,

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.064
you can review it on Khan Academy,

00:01:57.064 --> 00:02:00.192
that is going to be one half

00:02:00.192 --> 00:02:03.942
times cosine of the
difference of MT minus NT

00:02:05.738 --> 00:02:08.350
so I can write that as M minus MT,

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:09.183
M minus NT

00:02:11.724 --> 00:02:12.641
plus cosine

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.690
plus cosine of MT plus
NT, which I can write as

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:19.523
M plus NT

00:02:22.481 --> 00:02:23.314
DT

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:25.479
D

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:26.542
DT

00:02:26.542 --> 00:02:28.730
So let's think about two situations.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.713
Let's think about the first situation.

00:02:30.713 --> 00:02:34.098
When, let me redo that DT in blue.

00:02:34.098 --> 00:02:34.931
So DT.

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:40.060
So when, actually let me now
use some integration properties

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.569
to expand this out a little bit.

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:43.860
This is going to be equal to,

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.053
so I'm a write this as
two different integrals.

00:02:46.053 --> 00:02:48.964
So one integral from zero to two pi

00:02:48.964 --> 00:02:51.438
and we'll put the DT right over here

00:02:51.438 --> 00:02:55.220
and then have another
integral from zero to two pi

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.400
then I'm a throw that DT out here

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.617
and so, just using some
integration properties,

00:03:00.617 --> 00:03:03.146
we're gonna do one half
times this integral

00:03:03.146 --> 00:03:04.146
of cosine of

00:03:06.241 --> 00:03:07.324
M minus NT DT

00:03:09.467 --> 00:03:11.550
and then plus, I'm just
distributing the one half

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.041
and using some integration
properties, one half,

00:03:14.041 --> 00:03:15.576
and now this integral
is going to be cosine

00:03:15.576 --> 00:03:16.576
of M plus N.

00:03:18.145 --> 00:03:18.978
M plus NT

00:03:20.817 --> 00:03:22.163
DT

00:03:22.163 --> 00:03:23.558
Now let's think about it.

00:03:23.558 --> 00:03:28.132
When M and N are integers
that don't equal each other,

00:03:28.132 --> 00:03:29.990
don't equal their negative,

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:33.401
so let's think about M not equaling N

00:03:33.401 --> 00:03:38.121
or M not equaling negative
N and we're always assuming

00:03:38.121 --> 00:03:41.247
that these things are
going to be integers.

00:03:41.247 --> 00:03:44.009
M and N, well in that situation

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:48.648
this right over here is going
to be a non zero integer

00:03:48.648 --> 00:03:52.369
and this right over here
is going a non zero integer

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:55.775
and we've already established,
we've already established

00:03:55.775 --> 00:03:57.456
that if you have a non
zero coefficient here

00:03:57.456 --> 00:03:59.342
that this definite integral
is going to be equal to zero.

00:03:59.342 --> 00:04:01.586
The definite integral from zero to two pi

00:04:01.586 --> 00:04:05.415
of cosine of some non
zero integer times T DT.

00:04:05.415 --> 00:04:09.282
Well that's exactly what
both of these integrals are.

00:04:09.282 --> 00:04:11.504
This is the integral from
zero to two pie of cosine

00:04:11.504 --> 00:04:13.946
times some non zero integer T

00:04:13.946 --> 00:04:16.903
or non zero integer times T DT.

00:04:16.903 --> 00:04:19.578
So in this case where M and N are integers

00:04:19.578 --> 00:04:20.589
that don't equal each other,

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:22.289
don't equal the negatives of each other,

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:24.041
both of these integrals
are going to be zero.

00:04:24.041 --> 00:04:25.675
Then you're going to
multiply that times one half,

00:04:25.675 --> 00:04:27.620
one half times zero zero,
one half times zero zero,

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.312
it's all gonna end up being zero.

00:04:30.312 --> 00:04:32.312
So that should hopefully

00:04:33.156 --> 00:04:37.970
make you feel pretty good
about the case, this first case

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.114
and now let's think about the second case

00:04:40.114 --> 00:04:42.564
where M is a non zero
integer, or we can say,

00:04:42.564 --> 00:04:46.508
were M is equal to N, so in that situation

00:04:46.508 --> 00:04:50.384
N and M are the same and
they are not equal to zero.

00:04:50.384 --> 00:04:52.279
So let's just take that situation,

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:53.283
especially because when we're looking

00:04:53.283 --> 00:04:55.602
at fourier coefficients, we care about

00:04:55.602 --> 00:04:59.312
the non-negative
coefficients, at least the way

00:04:59.312 --> 00:05:03.434
we have defined so let's just
assume that M is equal to N

00:05:03.434 --> 00:05:06.017
and that M is not equal to zero

00:05:07.787 --> 00:05:11.176
and that would just resolve,
that would take this integral

00:05:11.176 --> 00:05:13.017
and turn it into that integral.

00:05:13.017 --> 00:05:16.594
Well in that situation,
what's gonna happen?

00:05:16.594 --> 00:05:19.459
Well, this first integral right over here,

00:05:19.459 --> 00:05:23.190
if M is equal to N and
M is not equal to zero,

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.997
well it's going to be M minus N,

00:05:25.997 --> 00:05:28.748
this is gonna be zero
T so this whole thing

00:05:28.748 --> 00:05:31.970
is going to simplify to one
and then this right over here

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:36.707
gonna have M plus N, that's
going to simplify to two M.

00:05:36.707 --> 00:05:39.134
So let's rewrite the integrals here.

00:05:39.134 --> 00:05:41.378
This is going to be equal to one half

00:05:41.378 --> 00:05:45.378
times the definite integral
from zero to two pi.

00:05:47.698 --> 00:05:51.884
Zero to two pi of one times,
I'll write that one here,

00:05:51.884 --> 00:05:52.717
one DT

00:05:55.527 --> 00:05:57.944
plus one half, plus one half,

00:05:59.918 --> 00:06:02.736
that's a new color, times the integral

00:06:02.736 --> 00:06:05.153
from zero to two pi of cosine

00:06:07.676 --> 00:06:09.676
let me do that the same,

00:06:10.651 --> 00:06:11.651
of cosine of

00:06:13.687 --> 00:06:14.520
two MT DT.

00:06:16.989 --> 00:06:17.822
Two MT D

00:06:19.365 --> 00:06:20.198
DT

00:06:21.727 --> 00:06:23.131
DT

00:06:23.131 --> 00:06:25.835
So once again, we're assuming
M is not equal to zero,

00:06:25.835 --> 00:06:27.290
this is the definitive integral

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:29.417
from zero to two pi of cosine times

00:06:29.417 --> 00:06:32.250
some non zero coefficient times T.

00:06:33.122 --> 00:06:35.579
Well once again, we have
established multiple times

00:06:35.579 --> 00:06:38.183
that this is going to be zero
so this whole second term

00:06:38.183 --> 00:06:41.079
is going to be zero and this first one

00:06:41.079 --> 00:06:43.409
is going to be equal to,
let's go to neutral color,

00:06:43.409 --> 00:06:46.247
it's going to be one half times
the anti derivative of one,

00:06:46.247 --> 00:06:50.293
now that just T evaluated
from zero to two pi

00:06:50.293 --> 00:06:52.654
so that's going to be equal to one half

00:06:52.654 --> 00:06:55.386
times two pi minus zero

00:06:55.386 --> 00:06:58.960
two pi minus zero, well
that's just one half two pi

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.595
which is equal to pi.

00:07:00.595 --> 00:07:03.680
So we have now established
this one as well

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.239
and now we have a full toolkit.

00:07:06.239 --> 00:07:07.909
We now have a full toolkit

00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:10.314
for evaluating the fourier coefficients

00:07:10.314 --> 00:07:12.303
which we will now do in the next video

00:07:12.303 --> 00:07:13.837
which is very exciting.
