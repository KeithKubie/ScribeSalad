00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:03.000
NARRATOR: Located between
the border of Spain

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.040
and France is the
Pyrenees mountain range.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.170
The people that occupy
this isolated region

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.040
are known as the Basque, and
they have long confounded

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.880
anthropologists and historians.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.170
The language spoken
by the enclave

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.420
is not related to any other
in that part of the world.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.920
And the population
also has the highest

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.380
concentration of Rh negative
blood type in the world.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.920
Up to 35% of Basque people
have Rh negative blood.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.540
And Rh negative blood is one of
the most unusual blood types.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.920
And it's the one
blood type that is

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.540
least likely to
mutate or interact

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.580
with other blood types.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.540
NARRATOR: Human blood
types are grouped

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:04.290
into four distinct designations
that include O, A, B, and AB.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.750
Additionally, there is another
variance between blood types

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.290
known as the Rh
factor, or Rhesus

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.040
factor, which is a measure
of Rhesus-based antigens

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.710
in the blood.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.960
The name comes from
a monkey from India

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.880
and other parts of Asia,
which is the Rhesus macaque.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.120
And this monkey was
used in experiments

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.750
looking at blood transfusions.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.880
How blood was received
from recipients varied.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.290
And it was discovered
that the Rhesus factor

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.040
could be positive or negative.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.620
Most humans in the world
are Rhesus positive.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.580
NARRATOR: 85% of humans in
the world are Rh positive

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.670
and have no issues receiving
blood from positive or negative

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:53.250
donors.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.830
But for the Rh
negative population,

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.460
receiving Rh
positive blood may be

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.330
fatal, as the body will try to
destroy the foreign antigens.

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.500
And for women that
are Rh negative,

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.960
mating with an Rh
positive partner

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.620
could be detrimental
to the fetus.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.170
If a Rhesus positive and a
Rhesus negative parents were

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.120
to have an offspring,
there is a potential danger

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.540
to the offspring.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.120
Because these two blood
types can't interbreed,

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.880
basically, medical
intervention is needed.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.290
That's why, actually,
in the past,

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.670
people had to have a
blood test before they

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.710
were allowed to get married.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.710
NICK REDFERN: The very fact
that an Rh negative mother--

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.540
her body would actually try
to kill an Rh positive baby--

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.460
generates bizarre scenarios.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.170
How on Earth could this happen?

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.790
It suggests somewhere
in our lineage

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.830
that the Rh negatives
and the Rh positives

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.170
are perceived as being
profoundly different.

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.710
And also, studies
of Rh negatives

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.330
suggest that they have lower
than normal blood pressure,

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.210
lower than normal pulse.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.080
In a number of cases, they
have an extra vertebra

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.750
in their back.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.210
Rh negative is very rare.

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.750
Most of the world didn't
have it until colonization

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.580
started in the 15th century.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.750
Rh negative didn't
exist in the Americas.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.750
It didn't exist in
Southern Africa.

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.580
It didn't exist in Asia.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.040
It was only in Europe.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.710
So it spread out from there.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.380
Out of Africa,
that theory has it

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.380
that all human beings
originated in Africa,

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.540
Southern Africa, sub-Sahara.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.920
They're all Rh positive.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.670
They don't have any Rh negative.

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.120
Where did Rh
negative evolve then?

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.960
GEORGE NOORY: 15% of the
humans have Rh negative blood.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.080
15%.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.620
And scientists have no
idea where it came from.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.040
What they do believe is
that if you have that,

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.880
you may have been evolved
from a different kind

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.880
of species on this planet.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:16.290
Now, was that species put here,
genetically altered, or was it

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.920
just a natural
formation of the planet

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.210
in its evolutionary stage?

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:22.540
Who knows?

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.290
But the fact is that
Rh negative people--

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.120
and again, there's 15%
of them on this planet--

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.500
may have come from
outside sources.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.120
NARRATOR: Could the
Rh negative blood type

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.170
offer evidence of a vastly
different pre-human evolution

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.460
than what we are led to
believe in our history books?

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.000
Might it offer
indisputable proof

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.670
of extraterrestrial
intervention in the remote past?

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.500
But if so, is the
experimentation

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.500
with intelligent hominid over,
or is it still taking place?
