00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.370
If you’ve never had the pleasure of dining
in a Chuck E. Cheese’s restaurant before,

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.220
imagine for a moment an unending assault on
every single one of your senses at once while

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.410
a giant robotic rat mocks your existence with
a dead, lifeless stare and you’ve basically

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:27.410
got it.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.419
Conceived by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell,
much like Atari itself (see our article here)

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:38.470
Chuck E. Cheese’s more or less bumbled its
way to success, inadvertently helping to change

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.111
the landscape of American family dining in
the process.

00:00:41.111 --> 00:00:45.560
The story of Chuck E. Cheese’s can be traced
back to an epiphany Bushnell had while with

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.560
Atari.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.010
Specifically, when he noticed that while Atari
could generally expect to make between $1,500

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.900
and $2,000 for every coin-operated arcade
machine they sold, the person buying them

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.470
could reliably expect the machine the generate
10 times that amount during its lifetime.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.149
In Bushnell’s own words: “It didn’t
take rocket science to say I’m on the wrong

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:07.220
side of the equation.”

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.040
After a little research, Bushnell concluded
that maximising profits from arcade games

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.060
and the like was all about securing a location
and having a captive audience- two things

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.690
he reasoned he could easily achieve with a
restaurant.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.990
Bushnell’s idea then was to create a restaurant
where food was, as he described, “an ancillary

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.049
service” and the real draw was the games
and entertainment.

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:31.770
Essentially, he wanted to create something
similar to a casino in Las Vegas (food, games,

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.170
and other entertainment), but for the whole
family.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.340
To this end, Bushnell decided that his restaurant
should sell pizza, reasoning that it would

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.659
be impossible to screw up such a simple foodstuff
as long the ingredient were good.

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.740
This was important as he noted he really had
no idea how to run a restaurant business,

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.420
so keeping it simple was paramount.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.530
A secondary reason Bushnell decided to sell
pizza instead of, say, fast-food style burgers

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.131
and fries, is that pizza has a built in “wait
time” once ordered- time that could be spent

00:02:01.131 --> 00:02:04.650
playing the multitude of arcade games he planned
to outfit his restaurant with.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.090
Knowing that parents would naturally want
to avoid a restaurant where the contents of

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.790
their wallet would be siphoned away by Pac
Man and his digital friends, Bushnell also

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.510
decided it would be a good idea to have other
forms of entertainment at his restaurants.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:18.560
In his own words,

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.840
The reason for doing the animals, believe
it or not, was not for the kids.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.959
It was meant to be a head fake for the parents.

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.230
Kids are really smart at knowing how to play
their parents.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.150
and the kids knew that if they said, ‘I
want to go to Chuck E. Cheese and play the

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.930
games’ the parents would just see themselves
spending money.

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.150
But if they said, ‘I want to go see Chuck
E. Cheese entertainment — and it’s free,’

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.590
they’d be good to go.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.950
The other thing was that we wanted the parents
to have something to amuse themselves while

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.430
the kids were in the game room.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.319
If you listened to the dialogue, it was fun,
edgy stuff, kinda like Toy Story, written

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:49.370
as much for the parents as the kids.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.700
Bushnell eventually settled on having this
entertainment meted out by animatronic animals

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.349
after a trip to the Tiki Room in Disneyland
and reasoning that making a robo-animal rap

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.550
or tell a joke would be child’s play for
his engineers.

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.990
According to Bushnell, the working name for
his pet project was originally Coyote Pizza.

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.629
As such, he bought a coyote costume he saw
at a tradeshow which he sent to his engineers

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:14.960
with a note instructing them to shove a robot
inside it and make it talk.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.770
Unfortunately for Bushnell, what he had thought
was a coyote costume turned out to actually

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.319
be a rat, which his engineers dutifully pointed
out when he asked them, “How’s the coyote

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:24.319
coming?”

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.400
At that stage of the game, Bushnell decided
it would be easier to rename the restaurant

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.850
than, you know, sending the costume back and
getting a different one, so told his marketing

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.709
team he now wanted to call the restaurant
Rick Rat’s Pizza…

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:37.959
The marketing team, according to Bushnell,
“had a shitfit.

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.040
‘You can’t call a restaurant a rat place!

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.650
People think rats are dirty.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.740
It’s not going to work.'”

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.810
Bushnell’s response was to tell them to
just pick another name then if it was such

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.370
a big deal, adding, “I don’t give a shit
what it is.

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.050
But it has to be happy.”

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.760
The name they eventually settled on was Chuck
E. Cheese’s, apparently because you have

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.349
to smile a couple times while saying it…

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:04.260
Amazingly the scheme worked, and the chain
exploded in popularity.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.799
Even after a pretty catastrophic fall in much
more modern times when the games and entertainment

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:13.930
there became more than antiquated, the company
still managed to sell for just shy of $1 billion

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:20.150
in 2014, with the new ownership taking steps
to modernize the whole affair, and well over

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:59.999
600 locations still in operation world-wide
today.
