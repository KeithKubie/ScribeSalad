00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:01.490
And there you have it.

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:03.020
With the right safety goggles in place,

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.080
namely our linters in the unit test
suite, you'll feel a lot safer and

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.960
can iterate our new changes
without worrying too much.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.820
&gt;&gt; Linting and continuous integration
can help you find errors in your

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.030
code when they're easily fixable,
before they become a catastrophe.
