00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:03.260
Let's see if we can
calculate the volume

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.220
of this rectangular
prism, or I guess

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.130
you think this thing
is the shape of a brick

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.990
or a fish tank right over here.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.670
And what's interesting is
now that the dimensions are

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.550
actually fractions,
we have a width.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.120
Yeah, we could call
this the width.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.160
The width here is 3/5 of a unit.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.030
The length here is
1 and 1/6 units,

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.070
and the height here
is 3/7 of a unit.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.670
So I encourage you
to pause this video

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.200
and try to figure out the volume
of this figure on your own

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.400
before we work
through it together.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.480
So there's a couple of
ways to think about it.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.240
One way to think
about it is you're

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.110
trying to pack
unit cubes in here,

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.680
and one way to think about
how many unit cubes could fit

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.940
in here is to think about
the area of this base

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.670
right over here.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.240
So sometimes you'll
see volume is

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:58.590
equal to the area of the
base times the height.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.939
This right over
here is the height,

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:02.980
and let me make it clear.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.430
This is the area of the base.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.720
Area of the base
times the height.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.710
Well, what's the
area of the base?

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.810
Well, the area of the
base is the same thing

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.549
as the length times
the width, so you

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:15.840
might see it written like that.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.010
You might see it
written as area of base

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.826
is going to be your
length times your width.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.910
Length times width is the same
thing as your area of the base,

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.640
so that's that right over there.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.871
And of course, you still have
to multiply times the height.

00:01:38.871 --> 00:01:40.370
Or another way of
thinking about it,

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:41.869
you're going to
multiply your length

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.140
times your width
times your height.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.600
You're going to multiply the
three dimensions of this thing

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.530
to figure out how many
unit cubes could fit

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.970
into it, to figure
out the volume.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.280
So let's calculate it.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.540
The volume here is going
to be-- what's our length?

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.040
Our length is 1 and 1/6 units.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.096
Now, when I multiply
fractions as I'm about to do,

00:02:03.096 --> 00:02:04.720
I don't like to
multiply mixed numbers.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.670
I like to write them
as improper fractions,

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.770
so let me convert 1 and 1/6
to an improper fraction.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.070
So 1 is the same thing as 6/6.

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.400
Plus 1 is 7/6.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.850
So this is going
to be 7/6-- that's

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:26.810
my length-- times
3/5-- that's my width--

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.182
times the height, which is 3/7.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.990
And we know when we
multiply fractions,

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.570
we can multiply the numerators,
so it's going to be 7 times

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:47.080
3 times 3.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.790
And the denominator, we can
just multiply the denominators.

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:56.530
So it's going to be
6 times 5 times 7.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.460
Now, we could just
multiply these out,

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:06.630
but just to try to get an
answer that has as simplified

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.750
as I can make it,
let me-- we see

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.210
we have a 7 in the numerator
and a 7 in the denominator,

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.615
so let's divide the numerator
and the denominator by 7.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.110
And what that does is that
becomes 1, and those become 1.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.430
We also see what the numerator
and the denominator has 3.

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:28.660
They're both divisible by 3.

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:29.570
We see a 3 up here.

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.080
We see of 3 over here.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.500
So let's divide
both the numerator

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.520
and the denominator by 3.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.260
So we divide by 3.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.582
Divide by 3.

00:03:37.582 --> 00:03:39.940
3 divided by 3 is 1.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:45.340
6 divided by 3 is
going to be equal to 2.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.525
So in our numerator,
what are we left with?

00:03:47.525 --> 00:03:49.900
This is going to be equal to
what we were just left with,

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.510
that green 3.

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:57.020
It's going to be equal
to 3 over 2 times 5.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.570
2 times 5 is 10.

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.450
2 times 5 right over here.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:06.220
So it's going-- the volume
over here is 3/10 units cubed,

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.180
or we could fit 3/10 of a unit
cube inside of this brick,

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.520
or this fish tank, or
whatever you want to call it.
