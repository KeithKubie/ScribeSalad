MAN, I JUST WENT THROUGH MY
FIRST WINTER HERE IN NEW YORK.

00:00:03.302 --> 00:00:05.138 size:84% position:42% line:85%
A LITTLE COLD FOR MY TASTE.

00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:11.844 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT FINALLY IT'S STARTING TO
WARM UP, YES.

00:00:11.877 --> 00:00:12.711 align:start position:0% line:85%
YES.

00:00:12.745 --> 00:00:14.414 align:start position:0% line:91%
[APPLAUSE]
ONLY TWO MONTHS UNTIL THE CITY

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:18.051 align:start position:0% line:91%
STARTS TO SMELL LIKE A HOT
DIAPER, CANNOT WAIT.

00:00:18.084 --> 00:00:19.986 align:start position:0% line:85%
CANNOT WAIT.

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:22.488 align:start position:0% line:91%
[LAUGHTER]
FINALLY MAN TRYING TO GET OUT OF

00:00:22.521 --> 00:00:23.423 align:start position:0% line:85%
MY UGGS.

00:00:23.456 --> 00:00:27.560 align:start position:0% line:91%
[LAUGHTER]
AND GET INTO MY OTHER UGGS.

00:00:27.593 --> 00:00:30.029 align:start position:0% line:91%
[LAUGHTER]
YEP.

00:00:30.062 --> 00:00:31.464 align:start position:0% line:85%
IT'S WARMING UP FOLKS.

00:00:31.497 --> 00:00:34.801 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT MEANS TONIGHT TALKING ABOUT
CLIMATE CHANGE.

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:38.771 size:75% position:38% line:85%
YEP, THAT'S HOW I DO IT.

00:00:38.804 --> 00:00:39.405 align:start position:0% line:85%
SCIENCE.

00:00:39.438 --> 00:00:43.076 size:84% position:42% line:85%
YESTERDAY COLD, TODAY WARM.

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:47.213 align:start position:0% line:85%
CLIMATE CHANGES.

00:00:47.246 --> 00:00:50.716 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOW A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE
TO TALK ABOUT THIS.

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:55.955 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
THEY'RE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE BUT
IT'S MUY IMPORTANTE.

00:00:55.988 --> 00:00:59.058 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND WE NEED TO HAVE AN HONEST
CONVERSATION.

00:00:59.091 --> 00:01:01.727 align:start position:0% line:91%
WE NEED TO KEEP THIS A
HUNDRED DEGREES. AND WHERE

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.764 align:start position:0% line:91%
BETTER THAN TO TALK ABOUT THIS
THAN LEVEL HEADED FLORIDA.

00:01:04.797 --> 00:01:08.768 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE STATE EPA BANNED
THE EMPLOYEES FROM USING THE

00:01:08.801 --> 00:01:11.404 align:start position:0% line:91%
TERM CLIMATE CHANGE OR GLOBAL
WARMING.

00:01:11.437 --> 00:01:13.873 align:start position:0% line:91%
THIS WENT INTO EFFECT AFTER
REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT

00:01:13.906 --> 00:01:14.941 align:start position:0% line:85%
TOOK OFFICE.

00:01:14.974 --> 00:01:19.178 size:78% position:39% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry:  SO THE FLORIDA
DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENT

00:01:19.211 --> 00:01:20.913 align:start position:0% line:91%
PROTECTION CAN'T USE THE WORDS
CLIMATE CHANGE.

00:01:20.946 --> 00:01:26.752 size:81% position:41% line:91%
THAT'S LIKE TELLING RUDY
GIULIANI HE CAN'T USE 911.

00:01:26.785 --> 00:01:27.753 align:start position:0% line:85%
IT'S NOT FAIR.

00:01:27.786 --> 00:01:28.888 align:start position:0% line:85%
IT'S NOT FAIR.

00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:30.590 align:start position:0% line:91%
[APPLAUSE]
THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING.

00:01:30.623 --> 00:01:32.592 size:81% position:41% line:91%
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE TERM
CLIMATE CHANGE. THEY CAN'T

00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:38.164 align:start position:0% line:91%
THINK IT'S ONE OF THOSE CRAZY
LEFT WING TERMS LIKE HEALTHCARE,

00:01:38.197 --> 00:01:39.265 align:start position:0% line:85%
RIGHT.

00:01:39.298 --> 00:01:40.466 align:start size:91% position:9% line:91%
I DON'T THINK THE LEFT HAD
ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.004 line:91%
&gt;&gt; IN 2002 FRANK LUTZ ADVISED
REPUBLICANS AND THEN PRESIDENT

00:01:45.037 --> 00:01:47.006 line:91%
GEORGE W. BUSH TO JUST STOP
TALKING ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:49.142 line:85%
BECAUSE IT'S SCARY 

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:52.178 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND START USING A LESS
SCARY PHRASE, CLIMATE CHANGE.

00:01:52.211 --> 00:01:54.180 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry:  SO REPUBLICAN
GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT IS BANNING

00:01:54.213 --> 00:01:57.116 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE TERM CLIMATE CHANGE WHICH IS
THE TERM REPUBLICANS CAME UP

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.354 align:start position:0% line:91%
WITH TO BAN THE TERM GLOBAL
WARMING.

00:02:01.387 --> 00:02:04.991 line:91%
BECAUSE OVER TIME CLIMATE CHANGE
CAME TO MEAN WHAT GLOBAL WARMING

00:02:05.024 --> 00:02:05.825 align:start position:0% line:85%
MEANT.

00:02:05.858 --> 00:02:10.630 align:start position:0% line:91%
CAN'T WE JUST BAN THE TERM RICK
SCOTT?

00:02:10.663 --> 00:02:13.499 align:start position:0% line:91%
[APPLAUSE]
I MEAN, IT WOULD JUST BE CLEANER

00:02:13.532 --> 00:02:14.534 align:start position:0% line:85%
ALL RIGHT. HOLD ON NOW.

00:02:14.567 --> 00:02:17.136 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT'S NOT REALLY JUST A
RIGHT-LEFT ISSUE, THOUGH.

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:20.573 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYBODY WANTS TO
CONTROL LANGUAGE THESE DAYS.

00:02:20.606 --> 00:02:24.410 line:91%
&gt;&gt; FACEBOOK EXECUTIVE SHERYL
SANDBERG HAS STARTED A CAMPAIGN

00:02:24.443 --> 00:02:27.880 line:91%
TO STOP USING THE WORD BOSSY
WHEN TALKING TO GIRLS AND YOUNG

00:02:27.913 --> 00:02:29.048 align:start position:0% line:85%
WOMEN.

00:02:29.081 --> 00:02:31.517 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE ARGUMENT IS IT HINDERS THEM
ON THE PATH TO LEADERSHIP.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.886 size:84% position:42% line:85%
&gt;&gt; JUST BAN THE WORD BOSSY.

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:35.721 align:start position:0% line:85%
BE BRAVE, BE YOU.

00:02:35.754 --> 00:02:37.757 align:start position:0% line:85%
BAN BOSSY.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.760 align:start position:0% line:91%
[LAUGHTER]
&gt;&gt; Larry:  I DON'T KNOW IF I

00:02:40.793 --> 00:02:44.830 align:start position:0% line:91%
WOULD YELL THROUGH A MEGAPHONE
TO TELL PEOPLE NOT TO SAY

00:02:44.863 --> 00:02:45.597 align:start position:0% line:85%
BOSSY.

00:02:45.631 --> 00:02:51.337 align:start position:0% line:91%
[LAUGHTER]
MUDDY'S UP THE MESSAGE.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.540 size:88% position:44% line:91%
BUT I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE
SAYING. IF YOU CALL A GIRL

00:02:54.573 --> 00:03:00.246 line:91%
BOSSY IT'S LIKE SHE'S BEING
PENALIZED FOR BEING ASSERTIVE

00:03:00.279 --> 00:03:01.147 line:91%
AND SO IT'S AN INSULT. I DON'T
KNOW IF WE NEED TO BAN THE WORD

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.084 line:85%
WE JUST NEED TO TELL PEOPLE TO

00:03:05.117 --> 00:03:07.386 align:start position:0% line:91%
STOP INSULTING WOMEN. JUST A
THOUGHT

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:09.455 align:start position:0% line:91%
[APPLAUSE]
BUT I GET IT.

00:03:09.488 --> 00:03:10.356 align:start position:0% line:85%
I GET IT.

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:11.691 align:start position:0% line:85%
I COMPLETELY GET IT.

00:03:11.724 --> 00:03:14.493 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
EVERY GROUP HAS THEIR TRIGGER
WORD.

00:03:14.526 --> 00:03:19.432 line:91%
RIGHT FOR BLACK PEOPLE IT'S THE
N WORD, FOR JEWISH PEOPLE IT'S

00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:24.737 line:91%
THE K MAKER, FOR PUERTO RICANS
IT'S BEING CALLED DOMINICAN.

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.806 size:81% position:41% line:85%
EVERYBODY HAS THERE THING.

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:30.676 line:91%
BUT UNIVERSITIES  HAVE THEIR
SENSITIVITY TURNED UP TO 11. 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:31.910 line:91%
&gt;&gt; AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
HOPED STUDENTS WILL STOP SAYING

00:03:31.944 --> 00:03:35.381 line:91%
CERTAIN WORDS AND PHRASES THAT
CAN BE CONSIDERED OFFENSIVE.

00:03:35.414 --> 00:03:41.020 align:start position:0% line:91%
SUCH AS ALIEN, ILLEGAL, GHETTO
AND GYP

00:03:41.053 --> 00:03:43.055 size:88% position:44% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry:  REALLY, THESE ARE

00:03:43.088 --> 00:03:45.858 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOUR WORDS? YOU'RE TAKING AWAY
ALL MY PARTS OF SPEECH

00:03:45.891 --> 00:03:49.929 align:start position:0% line:91%
IF AN ILLEGAL ALIEN GYPS ME IN A
GHETTO HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO

00:03:49.962 --> 00:03:57.336 align:start position:0% line:91%
CONSTRUCT A SENTENCE TO REPORT
THAT? I'M SCREWED

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:59.138 align:start position:0% line:91%
OK, WELL WHAT'S WRONG WITH
ILLEGAL ALIENS.

00:03:59.171 --> 00:04:03.075 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; "ILLEGAL ALIEN" IS SAID TO
SUPPORT THE BELIEF THAT 

00:04:03.108 --> 00:04:08.314 align:start position:0% line:91%
UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS ARE LESS
THAN HUMAN.

00:04:08.347 --> 00:04:09.248 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry:  HOLD ON.

00:04:09.282 --> 00:04:11.083 align:start position:0% line:91%
I ALWAYS THINK OF ALIENS AS MORE
THAN HUMAN.

00:04:11.116 --> 00:04:13.586 line:85%
THEY FLY AROUND IN SPACESHIPS.

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:16.722 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEY CAN COMMUNICATE
TELEPATHICALLY, THEY BELIEVE IN

00:04:16.755 --> 00:04:18.624 align:start position:0% line:85%
THE PRIME DIRECTIVE.

00:04:18.657 --> 00:04:22.995 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEY DID KIDNAP SKULLY BUT OTHER
THAN THAT, 

00:04:23.028 --> 00:04:24.229 align:start position:0% line:85%
THEY'RE PRETTY BADASS

00:04:24.263 --> 00:04:26.499 line:91%
YOU KNOW WHAT? IF THESE ARE THE
WORDS YOU CHOSE TO GET RID OF

00:04:26.532 --> 00:04:29.902 align:start position:0% line:91%
ON YOUR CAMPUS, YOU HAVEN'T
HEARD BAD WORDS YET.

00:04:29.935 --> 00:04:35.408 align:start position:0% line:91%
LET ME TAKE YOU GUYS TO
KNOWLEDGE COLLEGE FOR A QUICK

00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:36.042 align:start position:0% line:85%

00:04:36.075 --> 00:04:41.947 size:88% position:44% line:85%
PUTTING MY SMART PATCHES ON.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.149 size:75% position:38% line:85%
OOPS, THAT ONE FELL OFF.

00:04:43.182 --> 00:04:53.526 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S A DUMB PATCH.

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:55.961 align:start position:0% line:91%
PROFESSOR NIGHTLY'S IN THE
BUILDING.

00:04:55.994 --> 00:04:56.362 align:start position:0% line:85%
ALL RIGHT.

00:04:56.395 --> 00:05:00.566 align:start position:0% line:85%
THANK YOU.

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:01.967 size:75% position:38% line:85%
NOW LISTEN UNIVERSITIES.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.736 align:start size:94% position:6% line:91%
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT BAD
WORDS SOUND LIKE.

00:05:03.769 --> 00:05:09.442 line:91%
I HAD MY STAFF COME UP WITH THE
LIST OF THE WORST SLURS WHILE I

00:05:09.475 --> 00:05:12.378 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
STEPPED OUT TO MAKE MYSELF AN
ARNOLD PALMER.

00:05:12.411 --> 00:05:15.415 align:start position:0% line:91%
THIS IS WHAT THEY CAME UP IN
FOUR AND-A-HALF MINUTES.

00:05:34.266 --> 00:05:41.240 align:start position:0% line:91%
WOW, I'M BASICALLY NEVER LEAVING
ANY ROOM MY STAFF IS IN AGAIN

00:05:41.273 --> 00:05:45.244 align:start position:0% line:91%
I DON'T TRUST THOSE GUYS AT ALL.
THIS IS WHAT THEY TALK ABOUT

00:05:45.277 --> 00:05:47.947 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHEN I'M NOT THERE?

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.249 align:start position:0% line:91%
I DON'T WANT TO BE CALLED ANY OF
THIS STUFF.

00:05:50.282 --> 00:05:55.254 align:start position:0% line:91%
OK, THIS SOUNDS HORRIBLE BUT DO
WE HAVE TO BAN DUNE COON?

00:05:55.287 --> 00:06:01.560 line:91%
I JUST LITERALLY NEVER HEARD OF
IT BEFORE AND NOW YOU'RE TAKING

00:06:01.593 --> 00:06:02.995 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT'S SUCH A TIGHT SLUR, YOU GUYS
KIND OF LIKE A HAIKU.

00:06:03.028 --> 00:06:06.699 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT'S JUST SO MUCH HATE IN SUCH A
LITTLE SPACE

00:06:06.732 --> 00:06:12.037 line:85%
AND IT SLAMS TWO GROUPS AT ONCE.

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:18.411 line:91%
I MEAN I HATE ITS HATE BUT YOU
GOT TO ADMIRE ITS EFFICIENCY.

00:06:18.444 --> 00:06:20.713 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT'S THE FORD FIESTA OF RACIAL
SLURS, THAT'S 

00:06:20.746 --> 00:06:21.213 align:start position:0% line:85%
ALL I'M SAYING

00:06:21.247 --> 00:06:21.714 align:start position:0% line:85%
KNOWLEDGE, YOU SEE.

00:06:21.747 --> 00:06:22.581 align:start position:0% line:85%
THE OTHER WORD.

00:06:22.614 --> 00:06:23.315 align:start position:0% line:85%
