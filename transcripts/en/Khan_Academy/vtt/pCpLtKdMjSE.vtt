00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:02.310
Good morning.

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.890
It's the morning after
Thanksgiving and I'm still

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.600
feeling sick with food,
but I will move

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.470
forward and do SAT videos.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:19.250
So we are on the third test in
The Official SAT Study Guide

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:20.990
on page 518.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.830
This is section two, so it's the
first math section in this

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:24.840
third test.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.690
And let's get started with the
problems. The first problem is

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:41.100
3x plus 9 is equal to 5x plus
1, and they want to know x.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.270
So this just a straightforward
algebra problem.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.930
Well, what we can do is, since
we don't have negative

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.370
numbers, let's subtract
1 from both sides.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.040
So you get 3x plus
8 is equal to 5x.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.250
Subtract 3x from both sides,
you get 8 is equal to 2x.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.250
Divide both sides by 2, you get
4 is equal to x, or x is

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.260
equal to 4, choice D.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.050
Problem number two.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.680
That was just a straightforward
problem.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.180
Problem number two.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:25.280
They give us a little sequence
here, so let's see, 7, 15, 31,

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.912
63, and it just keeps going.

00:01:28.912 --> 00:01:32.600
And it says, the first term in
the sequence was 7, and each

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.880
term after the first is
determined by multiplying the

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.780
preceding term by m,
and then adding n.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.970
So we multiplied by m
and then added n.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.900
OK, what is the value of m?

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.800
Well, you can just look at what
they're doing, right?

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.710
What do you have to multiply
7 by and add to get to 15?

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.430
Well, 7 times 2, plus 1
is equal to 15, right?

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.635
7 times 2, plus 1
is equal to 15.

00:02:03.635 --> 00:02:07.140
And then if you do 15 times
2, plus 1, you get 31.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.710
15 times 2, plus 1 is equal
to 31, and so forth.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:18.950
31 times 2, plus 1 is
equal to 63, right?

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.960
So in general, you're taking--
they're saying, each term

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.625
after the first is determined
by multiplying the preceding

00:02:25.625 --> 00:02:27.820
term by m, and then adding p.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.760
So we're multiplying by
2 and then adding 1.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.390
And they want to know what m is,
so we're multiplying by 2.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.025
So the choice is B.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:44.350
Next problem, number three.

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.130
And I'll switch colors
for this one.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.510
On number three, I went
to a bolder yellow.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.700
OK, so that was two
tables, they're

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:53.985
T-shirts, so there's color.

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:04.390
They have red, white,
and blue.

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:20.900
And then under size they have
small, medium, large, and

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.880
extra large.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.310
The table above shows the
different colors and sizes of

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.200
T-shirts that are available at
Independence High School.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.240
How many different combinations
of color and size

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.360
are possible?

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.570
Well, for each color there
are four sizes, right?

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.820
So you just multiply the number
of colors times the

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:39.980
number of sizes, right?

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.690
There's four reds, four
whites, four blues.

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:49.330
So it's 3 times 4 is equal
to 12, choice B.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.570
Once again, that was just a very
straightforward problem,

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.890
no real tricks there.

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.630
Problem number four.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.610
We're just going through these
problems. For which of the

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.440
following functions is-- and
they write-- let me clear this

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.690
because this might
take some space.

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.360
OK, so they say, for which
of these functions is the

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:20.250
following true: f of negative
3 is greater than f of 3?

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.140
And here are their choices.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:30.070
So choice a: f of x is
equal to 4x squared.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.600
Well, in this situation, we
can just look at this.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.360
f of negative 3 and f of 3 is
going to be the same thing,

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:42.610
because when you square the x
term, f of negative 3 is going

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:48.720
to be 4 times 9, which is the
same thing as f of 3, right?

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.810
So that's not going
to help us.

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.840
I got the 9 because I squared
the negative 3, or squared the

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.310
3, so this isn't the
right choice.

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.740
f of 3 is equal to f of
negative 3, choice a.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.570
Choice b: f of x is going
to be equal to 4.

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.220
Well, once again, this isn't
going to be our choice,

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.300
because f of x is the same
number no matter what, right?

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.770
It's 4, so there's no way that f
of negative 3 is going to be

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.700
greater than f of 3.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.830
So b is not our answer.

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:21.880
Choice c says f of x is
equal to 4 over x.

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.160
Well, this has possibility.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.620
So f of negative 3 is what?

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.620
Minus 4/3.

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.980
And f of 3-- well, no, this
isn't going to work.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.710
It's going to be positive 4/3,
so actually f of 3 is larger

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.150
than f of minus 3.

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.940
So that doesn't work.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:52.050
Choice e: f of x is equal to
4 minus x to the third.

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:56.040
This has potential, because
f of negative 3 is what?

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:05.900
It's 4 minus minus 27, which
equals 31, while f of 3 is 4

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.820
minus 27, which equals
minus 24.

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:12.620
So f of negative 3 is
larger than f of 3.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.250
So our answer is e.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:17.280
Next problem.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.460
We don't have to do the last
one, because we already found

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:25.216
one that fits our answer and
that solves our problem.

00:06:25.216 --> 00:06:26.530
Different colors.

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:28.886
OK, I will switch
to this color.

00:06:28.886 --> 00:06:30.136
OK, five.

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:36.550
The force required to stretch
a spring beyond its natural

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:38.580
length is proportional
to how far the

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:42.470
spring is being stretched.

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:45.090
And if you've taken physics,
you'd probably see this.

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:50.050
The force necessary is equal
to some k, right?

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:53.600
Which is the proportionality
constant times how far you're

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:53.980
stretching.

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:55.330
That's all they're
saying, right?

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.490
The force required to stretch
a spring beyond its natural

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:01.770
strength is proportional--
so that's what k means,

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:04.670
proportional-- to how far the
spring is being stretched. x

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:06.240
is how far its being
stretched.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:13.475
If a force of 15 pounds-- so
when F-- if a force of 15

00:07:13.475 --> 00:07:19.560
pounds stretches a spring 8
centimeters-- so 15 pounds

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:23.415
stretches 8 centimeters--
we've got to [? solve ?]

00:07:23.415 --> 00:07:27.420
for length-- what force, in
pounds, is needed to stretch

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:32.010
the spring 20 centimeters beyond
its natural length?

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:34.895
So we can just solve for k in
this equation and then apply

00:07:34.895 --> 00:07:36.560
it here, right?

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.270
This is x.

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:45.840
So 15 is equal to k times
8, or we could say k is

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:50.970
equal to 15 over 8.

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:52.700
So we know that k is
equal to 15 over 8.

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:54.670
And then here we have-- well,
what happens when x

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:56.150
is 20, what is F?

00:07:56.150 --> 00:08:03.750
Well then, F is equal to k, 15
over 8, times how far this

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:09.350
thing needs to be stretched
beyond its natural length.

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:12.540
So 15 over 8 times 20.

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:13.050
What is this?

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:16.230
So we can divide the top
and the bottom by 4.

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:19.380
So this goes 5, 2.

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:21.436
And what's 5?

00:08:21.436 --> 00:08:23.140
What's 5 times 15?

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:24.670
5 times 15, 75.

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:29.250
So it's 75 over 2.

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:31.560
And that's a strange number, but
it looks like we do have

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:32.650
choices that match that.

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:36.990
And that's 37.5, which
is choice E.

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:41.030
Next problem.

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:43.205
Actually, I've probably run out
of time, so I will do the

00:08:43.205 --> 00:08:44.520
next problem in the
next video.

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:45.770
See you soon.
