JAMES MULCAHY: Hey, guys.

00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.540
What's up?

00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:02.810
I'm James Mulcahy.

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.960
I'm the Lead Video Producer at
Zagat, which is, as you know,

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.010
the restaurant,
brand, and guidebook.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.640
So they called me in
to interview Gina, who

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.820
is a author of the
"Skinnytaste Cookbook,"

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.454
and she publishes recipes
at the Skinnytaste blog,

00:00:15.454 --> 00:00:16.120
Skinnytaste.com.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.330
GINA HOMOLKA: Mm-hmm.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.420
And you probably saw some of her
recipes today at Hemispheres.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:21.940
What did you make today,
or what were the recipes?

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.731
GINA HOMOLKA: The
Buttermilk Fried Chicken,

00:00:23.731 --> 00:00:28.940
the Sriracha Salmon,
the Brussels Sprouts

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.977
with Prosciutto.

00:00:30.977 --> 00:00:31.810
What else was there?

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.150
FEMALE SPEAKER: The farroto.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.492
GINA HOMOLKA: The
Carrot Farroto.

00:00:35.492 --> 00:00:36.890
FEMALE SPEAKER: The Greek salad.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:37.332
GINA HOLMOKA: Yes,
the chickpea salad.

00:00:37.332 --> 00:00:38.320
JAMES MULCAHY: There should
be a tasting with the talk

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:38.940
while we eat it--

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:39.990
GINA HOMOLKA: Yeah, we should.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.090
JAMES MULCAHY: --as we discuss.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.423
FEMALE SPEAKER: The carne asada.

00:00:42.423 --> 00:00:44.020
GINA HOMOLKA: Oh,
the carne asada.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.274
Yeah, that was
Ashley's favorite.

00:00:46.274 --> 00:00:48.440
JAMES MULCAHY: So I'm curious
just being from Zagat,

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.580
I think an easy place to
start is with restaurants.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.170
I always ask this
question to everyone

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.320
I meet, what's your favorite?

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.460
Where do you go in New York?

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:54.700
GINA HOMOLKA: Yeah.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.065
So I always have a
hard time with this

00:00:56.065 --> 00:00:58.340
because I feel like I don't
really have a favorite.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.220
Every day it might be
a different favorite.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.845
But we were just
talking about this now

00:01:01.845 --> 00:01:04.920
and I was saying I love Spice
Market in the Meatpacking

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.420
District.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.770
So today I'm going to
go with that answer.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:08.240
JAMES MULCAHY: That's good.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.340
You should come back
to Google cafeteria.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.780
They actually do some
great Indian food.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:11.750
GINA HOMOLKA: I love Indian.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.208
JAMES MULCAHY: The
lines are always

00:01:13.208 --> 00:01:15.570
like down the corridor
for Indian food days.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.140
GINA HOMOLKA: Yeah, definitely.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.723
I would definitely
come back for that.

00:01:17.723 --> 00:01:18.480
You let me know.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.438
JAMES MULCAHY: We will.

00:01:19.438 --> 00:01:20.011
We will.

00:01:20.011 --> 00:01:20.511
Cool.

00:01:20.511 --> 00:01:21.802
Let's talk about "Skinnytaste."

00:01:21.802 --> 00:01:23.370
I know you started
out as a blogger,

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.870
and it's just you, right,
just writing a blog.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.370
How did that begin,
and did you ever

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:28.850
think it would get
to this point where

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.059
there's these projections
of a book behind us where--

00:01:31.059 --> 00:01:31.766
GINA HOMOLKA: No.

00:01:31.766 --> 00:01:34.330
This whole thing is so surreal,
because I started as a photo

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.561
retoucher, and I was a graphic
designer, and I started a blog.

00:01:38.561 --> 00:01:40.310
I was trying to lose
weight for my wedding

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.200
and I couldn't find
anything to make online.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.700
I was Googling recipes for--
Weight Watcher-friendly

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.990
recipes, and everything I
found was really processed,

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.700
the sites were poorly designed.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.957
So I decided, well, let me just
try and see if I could do this.

00:01:54.957 --> 00:01:56.040
And I just started a blog.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.676
I was experimenting
with my own recipes

00:01:57.676 --> 00:01:59.550
that I was making at
home because I've always

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:00.580
loved cooking.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.600
And I started sharing
it out in this blog,

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.840
never realizing that people
would try the recipes

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.850
and comment and start giving
me all this great feedback.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.120
And they start losing weight and
telling me about their weight

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.080
loss stories.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.980
And it just inspired
me to keep going.

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.135
So this whole thing
has been a crazy ride.

00:02:20.135 --> 00:02:21.510
JAMES MULCAHY:
Was there a moment

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.380
when you were blogging in the
very beginning where you said,

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.040
oh, my god.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.075
This could be a career for me,
this could be a path forward.

00:02:28.075 --> 00:02:29.450
Like did you get
that one comment

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.170
that was like the aha moment?

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.630
GINA HOMOLKA: So when
I started blogging,

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.315
I didn't do it to
quit my career,

00:02:35.315 --> 00:02:37.940
because I loved being a retouch
and I loved working in the city

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.650
and working in a creative space.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.230
I think it was January
and my traffic spiked.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.130
It doubled overnight.

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.000
And my advertiser
that was working

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.770
with me called me and
said, what are you doing?

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.020
Are you working with a team?

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.334
Like what's going on?

00:02:53.334 --> 00:02:54.750
They were trying
to figure out why

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:55.860
I'm getting so much traffic.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.142
And I think that moment said,
wow, I could make a career out

00:02:58.142 --> 00:02:58.642
of this.

00:02:58.642 --> 00:03:02.380
But I didn't leave my
job yet because I really

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.100
loved working as a retoucher
and I was kind of afraid to just

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.070
leave during a recession.

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.500
So it wasn't until I
had my baby Madison--

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.001
now she's five-- that I actually
left and made it full-time.

00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:14.375
JAMES MULCAHY:
Was there a moment

00:03:14.375 --> 00:03:17.150
when you said, OK, I know
I can do this full-time?

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.400
GINA HOMOLKA: Yeah.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.190
Well, I probably knew I
could have done it full-time

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.040
when I had my
daughter, and it was

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.500
my husband who actually
had to push me and tell me,

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.380
why are you working?

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.340
You're doing so
great with this blog.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.275
You could do this at
home and raise Madison.

00:03:31.275 --> 00:03:33.700
And I kind of needed
him to make that push.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.592
But I think that was-- just
seeing the revenue that

00:03:36.592 --> 00:03:39.050
was coming from the blog, I
knew I could make it full-time.

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:40.200
JAMES MULCAHY: That's cool.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.824
So when you first
started experimenting

00:03:41.824 --> 00:03:43.570
with these recipes,
was there something

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.490
missing in other recipes
that you found when

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:46.740
you started Googling around?

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.114
What did you try to add when
you started the site to kind

00:03:49.114 --> 00:03:50.720
of this skinny conversation?

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.760
GINA HOMOLKA: So when I
first Googled recipes--

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.350
I was doing Weight
Watchers because I

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.440
was trying to lose weight--
everything was very processed.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.732
So it was like take a
can of Campbell's Soup

00:04:00.732 --> 00:04:02.940
and mix it with another
ingredient and that's dinner.

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.310
Now, I always liked cooking
and I had a nine-year-old

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.290
and she's picky, and my
fiance was very picky.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.862
So I knew I couldn't
make that for them.

00:04:11.862 --> 00:04:13.070
They would not be OK with it.

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.260
So I just started
taking my recipes

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.940
that they loved
and I just started

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.940
playing around with them
and making them lighter

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.700
and getting their thumbs
up or their thumbs down,

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.170
and that's how I started.

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.390
They critiqued everything.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.974
They still do.

00:04:25.974 --> 00:04:26.848
JAMES MULCAHY: Right.

00:04:26.848 --> 00:04:28.310
It's a pretty good
job, I imagine.

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:29.140
GINA HOMOLKA: Yes.

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.440
Yes.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.360
JAMES MULCAHY: So
did they lose weight

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.776
when they were critiquing?

00:04:30.776 --> 00:04:32.130
I know you told me
about your aunt, right?

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.921
GINA HOMOLKA: Yeah.

00:04:32.921 --> 00:04:36.310
So when I was doing the
cookbook, I, for the first time

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.930
used a recipe
tester to make sure

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.030
that all the recipes
were accurately written,

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.310
and she worked with
me for an entire year.

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.430
And I had so much food
for my blog and the book

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.670
from testing that I wound up
eating lunch with her every day

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.830
and then I would give her dinner
to take home for her family.

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.520
We had too much food and I
don't like throwing out food.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.840
So she started losing weight,
and every month I would see her

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.350
and she'd be like look,
my pants are really loose.

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:06.040
And for the entire year she went
from a size 14 to a size four.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.605
And we thought maybe she was
sick, she went to the doctor.

00:05:09.605 --> 00:05:11.230
And the doctor was
like you're perfect.

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:12.354
You're cholesterol's great.

00:05:12.354 --> 00:05:13.660
Like what are you doing?

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.192
And she's like you have
to go Skinnytaste.com.

00:05:16.192 --> 00:05:19.450
And I ask her all the
time, so what is it

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:20.610
that you did different?

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.380
And she's like you just taught
me how to cook different.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.590
I didn't realize that I
didn't need all that oil,

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.350
and I started trying things
that I would have never eaten

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.670
before, like spaghetti
squash or all these things

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.610
that she's never tried
before and she was now

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.680
eating and liking, and
her family was eating.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.440
And now she's still a size
four and she works out.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:39.550
She goes to the gym.

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.500
So she's completely
changed her life.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:42.140
JAMES MULCAHY:
That's amazing you

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:44.070
get a doctor to kind of
write the stamp of approval,

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.054
right, for the website.

00:05:45.054 --> 00:05:47.220
GINA HOMOLKA: I loved it
because I always got emails

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.178
from people telling me
about their weight loss,

00:05:49.178 --> 00:05:50.630
but I never actually met people.

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:54.320
So to actually see the
transition for the whole year,

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.729
it was an incredible thing.

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:56.520
JAMES MULCAHY: Yes.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.680
I imagine you've developed kind
of a following over the years

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.730
from the site that brought
you to this cookbook.

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:03.300
What is it like to
interact with these people?

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.760
GINA HOMOLKA: So that's my
favorite part of blogging.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.439
When I first started blogging,
getting their comments

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:09.730
is what made me addicted to it.

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:13.460
And when they started telling
me that I'm making a difference

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.887
and I'm helping them with
their weight loss journey,

00:06:15.887 --> 00:06:17.470
that's what made me
continue doing it.

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:20.420
It was never about making it
a career, about the money.

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.400
I felt like I had to
help these people.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.400
Like I like helping people and
I like doing things for people.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.800
So it's the most gratifying
feeling in the world.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.400
When I wake up some days,
I'm having a bad day

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.140
and I'll check my comments
or an email and somebody

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:37.810
sends me this beautiful email
that they used to be a diabetic

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:41.480
and now they're
diabetes is all clear

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.870
and they're losing
weight, or they're

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:45.700
starting to cook healthy
for their family.

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.140
Like that makes me feel so good.

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:49.810
So I know I'm making a
difference in people's lives.

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.935
JAMES MULCAHY: So yeah,
what's the secret then?

00:06:51.935 --> 00:06:53.450
You're getting
these emails, people

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:54.730
are clearly having effects.

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:56.640
Do you have a mantra
or kind of an idiom

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.190
that you're working in?

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:01.200
What do people learn when
they come to your site?

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.500
GINA HOMOLKA: I think
it's just about how

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.480
to balance your meals.

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.680
So I will use
leaner cuts of meat.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.235
I'll use whole grains.

00:07:11.235 --> 00:07:13.110
I'll make sure that the
portions are correct.

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:16.010
When I'm using grains I'll
increase the vegetables

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:18.622
so that you're getting
a decent portion.

00:07:18.622 --> 00:07:21.080
Obviously, you don't want to
be hungry just to lose weight.

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.870
So I make sure that all the
portions are always filling.

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:28.160
And just adding so much
flavor, seasonings, fresh herbs

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.234
is really just
what I like to do.

00:07:30.234 --> 00:07:31.900
JAMES MULCAHY: Is it
more about learning

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.290
how to change your lifestyle--

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:34.123
GINA HOMOLKA: It is.

00:07:34.123 --> 00:07:35.860
JAMES MULCAHY: --to
change your recipes?

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:37.235
GINA HOMOLKA: I
feel like anybody

00:07:37.235 --> 00:07:39.510
could take their favorite
recipe and make it lighter.

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:42.601
So it's not about not being
able to eat the foods you love.

00:07:42.601 --> 00:07:44.100
It's about taking
the foods you love

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:45.660
and learning how
to recreate them

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:49.717
so that you could still eat
them, just in a lighter way.

00:07:49.717 --> 00:07:51.300
JAMES MULCAHY: Is
there a few cuisines

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.450
that this works well with, or do
you just go all over the place?

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:54.491
GINA HOMOLKA: Everything.

00:07:54.491 --> 00:07:55.970
I love all kinds of cuisines.

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:57.200
JAMES MULCAHY: So you can
go to the Spice Market

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.040
across the street and
recreate the menu--

00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:58.450
GINA HOMOLKA: Absolutely.

00:07:58.450 --> 00:07:59.870
JAMES MULCAHY: make
it a little skinnier.

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:01.703
GINA HOMOLKA: That's
what I love doing, yes.

00:08:01.703 --> 00:08:03.630
JAMES MULCAHY:
Yeah, that's good.

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:06.220
I'm curious because I think a
lot of people-- maybe myself

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:08.754
included-- don't necessarily
want to commit to a diet

00:08:08.754 --> 00:08:09.920
or making all these recipes.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.840
Do you have three
or four easy tips

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.430
that you can change right
away, like small things that

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:16.949
would make a big difference?

00:08:16.949 --> 00:08:17.740
GINA HOMOLKA: Yeah.

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:21.330
If you drink soda, I would say
eliminate that immediately.

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:23.424
JAMES MULCAHY:
[LAUGH] Event diet?

00:08:23.424 --> 00:08:24.840
GINA HOMOLKA: Yes,
especially diet

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.610
because it's all processed.

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:30.010
So eliminating sodas is a first.

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:31.830
And I would say
drink lots of water

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:35.110
or seltzer-- my
husband likes seltzer.

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:36.990
Eliminating processed foods.

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:38.789
Eat clean.

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:41.839
I don't use fat-free ingredients
because they're so processed,

00:08:41.839 --> 00:08:44.130
and you wind up, I feel like,
gaining weight from them.

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:45.220
And they're not healthy.

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:49.210
So I say eliminating
all the processed junk.

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:54.150
And a third would I
would say exercise.

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:56.290
I try to exercise three
or four times a week.

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:58.027
So just having a balance.

00:08:58.027 --> 00:08:58.860
JAMES MULCAHY: Good.

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:00.410
I'm glad you didn't
say stop drinking beer.

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:01.190
GINA HOMOLKA: No.

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:04.277
I like My wine, so I do have
my occasional glass of wine.

00:09:04.277 --> 00:09:05.590
JAMES MULCAHY: That's good.

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:06.756
And what about the cookbook?

00:09:06.756 --> 00:09:09.740
So how did you jump from
blogging to publishing?

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:13.780
GINA HOMOLKA: So I was getting
requests from the Skinnytaste

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:16.280
fans, and they kept
asking me daily,

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:19.680
emailing me on Facebook, on
Twitter, everywhere possible,

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.310
so please come out
with a cookbook.

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:24.670
So I was like, all right,
I want to give them

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:26.465
the cookbook because
I'm a people pleaser

00:09:26.465 --> 00:09:28.810
and I want to give
people what they want.

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:31.410
And then I started getting
approached by publishers,

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:34.310
so I knew, all right, there's
a possibility to do this.

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:36.280
And then I got an
agent and started

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:37.810
working with Clarkson Potter.

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:38.360
JAMES MULCAHY: That's awesome.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.530
Clarkson Potter, they do a
lot of good food titles there.

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:41.650
GINA HOMOLKA: They
do great books.

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:43.830
JAMES MULCAHY: So what
was that like as opposed

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:46.390
to sitting on a computer
and publishing a blog post?

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:47.952
What was the cookbook
process like?

00:09:47.952 --> 00:09:49.410
GINA HOMOLKA:
Completely different,

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:50.830
because I feel like
in the beginning

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:52.830
it took me a long time
to come up with a recipe.

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:55.200
I just felt like with a
book it was so important

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.690
and it had to sit on a shelf.

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:59.317
So I really struggled
with the first recipe.

00:09:59.317 --> 00:10:01.650
And then when I realized wow,
for me to meet my deadline

00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:02.920
I have to complete four a week.

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:04.090
So then I started
getting cranking

00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:05.570
and was like, OK,
I could do this.

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:08.060
But it was different
also because I was still

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:12.390
creating content for my
blog, so there was just a lot

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:14.620
of coming up with new recipes.

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:16.550
But there was just that
importance of people

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:19.100
are paying for this,
as opposed to they

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:20.780
can get recipes for
free on my blog.

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:22.450
So that was probably
the difference.

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:23.810
JAMES MULCAHY: So it's not
just a collection of recipes

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:25.050
that people can find online.

00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:28.540
You have to get the book or
take the books on your seats

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:30.030
to get those specific recipes.

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:30.863
GINA HOMOLKA: Right.

00:10:30.863 --> 00:10:33.136
There's 25 from the blog,
125 that are brand new.

00:10:33.136 --> 00:10:35.635
JAMES MULCAHY: So how do you
come up with that many recipes?

00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:38.369
GINA HOMOLKA: I'm always
thinking about food.

00:10:38.369 --> 00:10:40.160
I'll be at the gym
talking to my girlfriend

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.368
and we're talking about food.

00:10:41.368 --> 00:10:43.082
Like we're always
talking about food.

00:10:43.082 --> 00:10:44.290
I'm always thinking about it.

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:46.498
I'm always thinking of how
to make something lighter,

00:10:46.498 --> 00:10:51.910
or what's a great swap to
make something different.

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:54.290
So I get inspired
when I go out to eat.

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:56.930
I love going out to
eat for that reason.

00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:59.635
I come up with really great
ideas from a great fish

00:10:59.635 --> 00:11:01.710
in a great restaurant.

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:06.200
Sometimes I get people that
send me requests for makeovers,

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.450
and those are usually some
of my most popular recipes.

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:10.240
JAMES MULCAHY: Like a green
bean casserole, but healthy?

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:11.031
GINA HOMOLKA: Yeah.

00:11:11.031 --> 00:11:12.198
I've done that for the blog.

00:11:12.198 --> 00:11:14.406
JAMES MULCAHY: I actually
had that over the holidays,

00:11:14.406 --> 00:11:16.220
and why is anyone
eating this anymore?

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:17.520
GINA HOMOLKA: Right, exactly.

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:18.360
JAMES MULCAHY: Cream
of mushroom soup.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.234
GINA HOMOLKA: Some of
my most popular recipes

00:11:20.234 --> 00:11:22.340
that are actually in the
book are makeovers, yeah.

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:24.070
JAMES MULCAHY: Yeah,
that's exciting.

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:26.560
I mean I think it must be
really hard to just like--

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:27.520
do you ever get tired?

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:31.350
You ever just say I don't
want to make anymore recipes?

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:33.350
GINA HOMOLKA: I
mean there are days

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:36.370
that I may not feel
like cooking, because I

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:37.730
cook every day.

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:39.290
But I give myself a break.

00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:41.157
On the weekends I'll
go out to dinner.

00:11:41.157 --> 00:11:42.490
It's where I get my inspiration.

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:44.460
But I love going
out to dinner, and I

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:45.650
feel like it's all balanced.

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:48.480
Like I eat really good
during the week and I know

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:49.495
I'm cooking good.

00:11:49.495 --> 00:11:51.740
So I allow myself a
treat on the weekends.

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:53.045
JAMES MULCAHY: Yeah,
so you have that moment

00:11:53.045 --> 00:11:54.586
and you're like I
just want a burger.

00:11:54.586 --> 00:11:55.630
I just want fries.

00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:56.256
That's allowed.

00:11:56.256 --> 00:11:57.046
GINA HOMOLKA: Yeah.

00:11:57.046 --> 00:11:58.560
It's usually not
what I'm craving,

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.205
and not the fries or the burger.

00:12:00.205 --> 00:12:01.486
I usually crave more like--

00:12:01.486 --> 00:12:03.750
JAMES MULCAHY: We're very
different people, clearly.

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:04.541
GINA HOMOLKA: Yeah.

00:12:04.541 --> 00:12:09.710
I'm probably craving a great
pasta dish or something.

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:10.440
Yeah.

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:12.870
JAMES MULCAHY: Do you
have any guilty pleasures?

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:14.980
GINA HOMOLKA: I would say wine.

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:17.313
JAMES MULCAHY: There's nothing
to be guilty about there.

00:12:17.313 --> 00:12:18.647
GINA HOMOLKA: Is that bad?

00:12:18.647 --> 00:12:19.480
JAMES MULCAHY: Wine.

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.740
You don't just like stuff
your face with Oreos?

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:21.910
GINA HOMOLKA: No.

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:22.810
I don't like Oreos.

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:24.200
I don't like sweets, really.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.180
So yeah, no.

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:29.560
Maybe banana pie, and I haven't
had that in a long time.

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:34.349
So no, I don't really-- the
sweets don't really bother me.

00:12:34.349 --> 00:12:36.640
JAMES MULCAHY: Do you feel
like your palate has changed

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.556
going through this process
from when you first

00:12:38.556 --> 00:12:40.834
started-- what you thought
tasted good to today?

00:12:40.834 --> 00:12:43.000
GINA HOMOLKA: I feel like
that happens all the time.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.400
But I grew up with parents that
cooked everything from scratch.

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:50.970
And they are both-- one is from
South America and one's Czech.

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:53.830
So I grew up with a lot
of diverse cuisines,

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:56.410
and I've always liked
trying new things.

00:12:56.410 --> 00:13:00.690
So I have a diverse
palate and I enjoy trying

00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:02.412
all different kinds of foods.

00:13:02.412 --> 00:13:03.870
JAMES MULCAHY: And
when you started

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:05.495
maybe you thought
you liked sweets more

00:13:05.495 --> 00:13:07.540
and now you just want the cal.

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:09.120
Because I've noticed
eating out a lot

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:11.940
that I only can eat
restaurant food now because I

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:15.010
eat it all the time, which
that's not a good thing.

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:16.860
GINA HOMOLKA: Right.

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:21.280
I guess I've probably grown
to like things that I didn't

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.040
before just out of making them.

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:27.210
Or I will take an ingredient
that I may not love and figure

00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:29.310
out a way to make it delicious.

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:30.810
JAMES MULCAHY: What
about your kids?

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:32.510
How do they react
to these recipes,

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:35.280
and do you have to make kind
of modifications for them

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:38.157
to make it maybe a little
bit more kid friendly?

00:13:38.157 --> 00:13:39.865
GINA HOMOLKA: I never
cook separate meals

00:13:39.865 --> 00:13:41.240
for my kids and myself.

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:44.120
Like my daughter Madison who's
five loves Brussels sprouts

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:46.330
raw, shaved, a salad.

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:48.132
She makes her own
salad and she asks

00:13:48.132 --> 00:13:49.590
me like when I'm
in the supermarket

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:50.900
and I call my husband,
do we need anything?

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:53.190
She's like make sure you
buy Brussels sprouts, which

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:54.290
is the strangest thing.

00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:58.570
Because I feel like she grew
up with me cooking and chopping

00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:02.360
and she was tasting all my
raw, like all my vegetables

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:03.970
when it was in the rough state.

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:05.260
So she tries everything.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.926
She doesn't like everything, but
she will always try everything.

00:14:07.926 --> 00:14:10.770
JAMES MULCAHY: But you don't
sneak them cookies or whatever

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:12.020
the unhealthy dishes would be?

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:13.686
GINA HOMOLKA: You
know they don't really

00:14:13.686 --> 00:14:15.150
think they're eating Skinny.

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:17.490
They just know they're
eating home-cooked meals

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:20.440
that their mom makes
for them and they love.

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:21.240
So yeah.

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:22.130
JAMES MULCAHY: I think
it's really weird.

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:23.410
I mean this generation
of kids that

00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:25.201
is growing up on whole
foods and growing up

00:14:25.201 --> 00:14:26.605
on all these natural organic.

00:14:26.605 --> 00:14:28.060
Like what's next for them?

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:28.960
Because I remember
the first time

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:31.630
I had an actually good Brussels
sprout that wasn't from a can.

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:32.060
GINA HOMOLKA: Right.

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:33.351
JAMES MULCAHY: This is amazing.

00:14:33.351 --> 00:14:34.895
But they all are
growing up on this.

00:14:34.895 --> 00:14:36.520
Are they going to go
back, the reverse,

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.016
be like I just
want Wonder bread?

00:14:38.016 --> 00:14:40.160
GINA HOMOLKA: You know, I feel
like there's still a long way

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:40.660
to go.

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:42.300
My daughter likes
Brussels sprouts,

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:46.430
but in school I hear from the
teachers that most of the kids

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:47.710
don't like healthy food.

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:50.849
So I feel like there's
still-- they're not there yet.

00:14:50.849 --> 00:14:52.390
JAMES MULCAHY: Well,
I think probably

00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:53.600
because they healthy
food that they're eating

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:55.377
is not like this healthy food.

00:14:55.377 --> 00:14:56.210
GINA HOMOLKA: Right.

00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:58.450
JAMES MULCAHY: It's kind of
like still processed-ish.

00:14:58.450 --> 00:14:59.283
GINA HOMOLKA: Right.

00:14:59.283 --> 00:15:01.682
I mean kids' palates,
they're all different,

00:15:01.682 --> 00:15:02.890
and some kids are very picky.

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:04.530
But I think it's
also important not

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:07.970
to cook separate
meals for your kids,

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:10.030
like macaroni and
cheese and pizza when

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:11.280
you're cooking something else.

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:14.050
I just say cook what
you're cooking for dinner

00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:16.060
and let them try a
little bit of everything.

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:19.130
And if she doesn't eat
the entire plate, it's OK.

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:20.120
At least she tries it.

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.660
I always make her
taste-- at least

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:23.700
take one bite of
something if she tells me

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:24.640
she doesn't want it.

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:27.057
And then she usually
winds up liking it.

00:15:27.057 --> 00:15:29.390
JAMES MULCAHY: I think they
would really like the Google

00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:30.020
cafeteria as well.

00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:30.976
There's always lots of kelp--

00:15:30.976 --> 00:15:31.460
GINA HOLMOKA: Oh, forget it.

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:33.000
JAMES MULCAHY:
Cauliflower's everywhere.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.374
GINA HOMOLKA: She would go
crazy in the raw bar, I think.

00:15:35.374 --> 00:15:36.442
She likes raw vegetables.

00:15:36.442 --> 00:15:38.150
JAMES MULCAHY: So what
do you hope people

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:40.200
will get out of your cookbook?

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.251
Is it a resource to
"The Joy of Cooking"

00:15:42.251 --> 00:15:43.500
that should be used every day?

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:45.970
Is it kind of a starter
to a diet when you start,

00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:48.835
I'm going to go buy
that and try to do this?

00:15:48.835 --> 00:15:50.690
GINA HOMOLKA: I hope
I could inspire people

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:53.010
to start cooking a
little healthier,

00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:54.600
just to give them a little hope.

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:55.910
Like if they're
trying to lose weight,

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:57.909
they don't feel like they
have to eat cardboard.

00:15:57.909 --> 00:16:01.960
That they could make a meal for
the entire family and everyone

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:02.960
will enjoy it.

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:05.110
Or even for people that
don't know how to cook.

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:08.040
It hopefully will show
people that it's not hard.

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:10.170
It's really simple.

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:13.340
I think my recipes are
all really easy to follow.

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:16.560
I use ingredients that you could
find in a local supermarket.

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:21.001
So if I can just inspire
somebody, then I did my job.

00:16:21.001 --> 00:16:22.750
JAMES MULCAHY: Do you
think you're a chef?

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:24.515
GINA HOMOLKA: I don't
call myself a chef.

00:16:24.515 --> 00:16:25.289
I'm a home cook.

00:16:25.289 --> 00:16:27.080
JAMES MULCAHY: What's
the difference there?

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:30.920
GINA HOMOLKA: I feel like a
chef has culinary training,

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:33.290
and I don't know all
those fancy techniques.

00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:34.940
I think that's why
maybe I'm relatable,

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:38.920
because I'm making a quick
dinner under 30 minutes

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:42.000
that my husband likes,
my daughter likes.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:42.701
That's my goal.

00:16:42.701 --> 00:16:44.450
I don't know how to
cook for a restaurant.

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:45.650
I can't cook for 80.

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:47.830
So I think there's a
big difference there.

00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:48.090
JAMES MULCAHY: Yeah.

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:50.265
I think maybe the art is the
same, but the kind of execution

00:16:50.265 --> 00:16:50.850
is different.

00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:51.683
GINA HOMOLKA: Right.

00:16:51.683 --> 00:16:53.070
And I'm learning as I go.

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:55.080
I'm always learning,
which is really fun.

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:57.580
JAMES MULCAHY: So being a person
who goes out to restaurants

00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:59.496
all the time, you say
you get your inspiration

00:16:59.496 --> 00:17:01.288
from restaurant meals
and things like that.

00:17:01.288 --> 00:17:03.246
When I'm looking at the
menu at the restaurant,

00:17:03.246 --> 00:17:05.790
are there certain things I
should kind of avoid and say

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:07.020
I'm going to be a little
bit better tonight,

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:09.339
and certain things that are
oh, I should go for that.

00:17:09.339 --> 00:17:11.713
GINA HOMOLKA: I mean if you're
trying to have a good day,

00:17:11.713 --> 00:17:15.569
I would say avoid the
bread basket probably.

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:19.569
Stick with avoid anything fried
and have the grilled fish.

00:17:19.569 --> 00:17:21.280
But when I go out
to dinner, I usually

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:24.009
order whatever is the special,
whatever appeals to me,

00:17:24.009 --> 00:17:25.800
and maybe I just won't
eat the whole thing.

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:27.940
I'll take half home
or I'll share it.

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:31.710
Like I love trying a new dish
so I can get the inspiration

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:33.042
to recreate it, you know?

00:17:33.042 --> 00:17:35.250
JAMES MULCAHY: Yeah, people
who I've really talked to

00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:38.180
and say they have a
really good diet success,

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:40.430
it's always portion
control seems to be a big--

00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:40.950
GINA HOMOLKA: Absolutely.

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:41.440
JAMES MULCAHY: --part of that.

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.240
Is that taken into
account in your recipes?

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:43.990
GINA HOMOLKA: Yes.

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:46.420
All my recipes have
the nutritional values

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:48.790
and the portion control
all printed in the book.

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:51.010
And I measure
everything precisely

00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:52.844
so that people know
what their portions are.

00:17:52.844 --> 00:17:54.551
JAMES MULCAHY: I've
tried to trick myself

00:17:54.551 --> 00:17:55.786
by getting the smaller dish.

00:17:55.786 --> 00:17:56.410
It never works.

00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:58.670
I just kind of fill it up twice.

00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:01.080
That's a myth, at least for me.

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:03.180
What about social media?

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:06.840
Because I know you started
your blog and that was in 2008?

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:07.340
2006?

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:08.290
GINA HOMOLKA: 2007.

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:09.123
JAMES MULCAHY: 2007.

00:18:09.123 --> 00:18:11.950
So that was like pre-Instagram,
pre-Twitter and pre

00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:12.650
all of that.

00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:15.510
How has that changed what
you do and how does it

00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:16.422
help what you do?

00:18:16.422 --> 00:18:18.630
GINA HOMOLKA: I think it
definitely helped what I do,

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:23.250
because most of my traffic
comes from social media.

00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:26.200
I think Google's my number
one source of traffic,

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:28.240
and number two is social media.

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.270
So it's huge.

00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:32.680
I mean some people
start new blogs

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:35.020
and are found on social media.

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:37.950
So I think I only
helps, not hurts.

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:40.500
I mean Instagram
I'm addicted to.

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:44.170
And I like to share
what I'm doing

00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:50.169
on a daily basis-- my recipes,
but also my kids, Google.

00:18:50.169 --> 00:18:50.960
Whatever I'm doing.

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.420
It's just like an
extension of my blog.

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:57.070
JAMES MULCAHY: So yay or nay at
the restaurant with your phone

00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:58.240
on the dish, on the table.

00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:58.630
GINA HOMOLKA: Yay.

00:18:58.630 --> 00:18:59.400
JAMES MULCAHY: That's allowed?

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:00.690
GINA HOMOLKA: I do
that, absolutely.

00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:02.050
JAMES MULCAHY: I
definitely do that.

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:03.960
I'm the guy who has one
phone here and a phone

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:04.959
with a flashlight there.

00:19:04.959 --> 00:19:06.750
So I get it right.

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:09.041
GINA HOMOLKA: I don't think
I'd go to a restaurant that

00:19:09.041 --> 00:19:10.494
didn't let me take pictures.

00:19:10.494 --> 00:19:12.910
JAMES MULCAHY: Do you think
if you started your blog today

00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:15.030
in this more digital age where
everyone's a little bit more

00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:17.630
dialed in, everyone is updating
Instagram all the time,

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:20.520
do you think you would have
found the same path to success?

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:22.603
GINA HOMOLKA: I think it's
a lot harder for people

00:19:22.603 --> 00:19:24.490
that are starting blogs today.

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:25.700
There's just so many.

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:27.960
There are millions
of blogs out there.

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:31.160
You really have to do something
that sets yourself apart,

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:35.049
whether it's your photography
or a different type of niche.

00:19:35.049 --> 00:19:36.840
But it's definitely
more challenging today.

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:38.510
JAMES MULCAHY: Yeah, I think
it's a lot more saturated.

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:40.620
If you're going to give
advice to someone who's

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:42.455
thinking about wanting
to start a blog

00:19:42.455 --> 00:19:44.705
and wanting to write about
food or get on social media

00:19:44.705 --> 00:19:47.390
and be a food person, what
advice would you give them?

00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:50.280
GINA HOMOLKA: I would say just
be authentic, be yourself.

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:52.910
Don't try to copy
somebody else's idea

00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:54.660
and try to do what
they're doing.

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:57.100
Everybody's unique and you
have something unique to bring.

00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:00.910
So I would say focus on what's
different about yourself.

00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:03.940
And also, really learn
how to use a camera,

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:08.300
because the photography is the
most important part of being

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:12.590
found on social media, or
even somebody trying a recipe.

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:14.300
If it looks good,
they'll make it.

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:15.680
JAMES MULCAHY: To see food
is such a visual thing--

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:15.960
GINA HOMOLKA: It really is.

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:16.760
JAMES MULCAHY: --and
people want to see--

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:17.240
GINA HOMOLKA: They
eat with their eyes.

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:18.425
JAMES MULCAHY: --what's
in front of them for sure.

00:20:18.425 --> 00:20:18.970
GINA HOMOLKA: Yeah.

00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:21.050
JAMES MULCAHY: I think just
being a blogger myself, I

00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:23.400
think the advice I would give is
don't get bummed if it doesn't

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:24.110
take off right away.

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:24.430
GINA HOMOLKA: Oh yeah.

00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:25.500
JAMES MULCAHY: It took
a long time for you

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:26.270
to get to this point.

00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:28.100
GINA HOMOLKA: If I would
have done this actually make

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:29.808
a career out of it I
would have given up,

00:20:29.808 --> 00:20:31.570
because I wasn't
getting much traffic.

00:20:31.570 --> 00:20:36.040
I was happy when I got
50 followers a month.

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:37.690
It was happy, but I
really just did it

00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:41.510
because I found it enjoyable.

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:43.170
I liked getting
comments from people,

00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:45.640
and people were trying my
recipes and giving me feedback.

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:47.380
So I did it because
I really thought

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:48.870
it was-- I was addicted to it.

00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:50.980
It wasn't really
about the income.

00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:52.680
JAMES MULCAHY: But now you have
to create content all the time.

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:53.070
GINA HOMOLKA: All the time.

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:54.220
JAMES MULCAHY: Does it
become swimmer or die

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:55.417
when you get to this level?

00:20:55.417 --> 00:20:57.750
GINA HOMOLKA: I mean there
are weeks that I make things,

00:20:57.750 --> 00:21:00.350
or I should say it
I could have a week

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:02.770
that nothing turns
out right and I'm

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:04.150
like what am I going to post?

00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:05.430
This is terrible.

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:07.430
They don't always come
out great the first time.

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:10.010
I usually have to experiment,
especially when I'm baking

00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:14.090
and I'm swapping
butter for avocados.

00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:16.050
The crazy things I do.

00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:17.790
Yeah, they don't always work.

00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:19.847
What was the question?

00:21:19.847 --> 00:21:21.430
JAMES MULCAHY: You
know, social media.

00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:22.221
GINA HOMOLKA: Yeah.

00:21:22.221 --> 00:21:23.305
So yeah, I don't remember.

00:21:23.305 --> 00:21:25.887
JAMES MULCAHY: I'm curious what
you do now to the recipes that

00:21:25.887 --> 00:21:26.560
don't work now?

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:27.670
GINA HOMOLKA: Oh, I throw
them in the garbage.

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:28.160
JAMES MULCAHY: No,
you should have

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.640
kind of like a Tumblr account
that have those bad recipes.

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:31.550
GINA HOMOLKA: Well, the
other day I actually

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:33.890
Instagramed a soup
that came out awful,

00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:36.725
and I was just so mad
because I spent hours on it.

00:21:36.725 --> 00:21:37.475
And I Instagramed.

00:21:37.475 --> 00:21:39.090
I'm like this was a fail.

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:41.420
And people are like so thank
you for letting us know

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:42.820
that that happens to you too.

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:44.736
But then people kept
asking me for the recipe.

00:21:44.736 --> 00:21:47.304
I'm like, but it's bad.

00:21:47.304 --> 00:21:49.760
I'm telling you, you
don't want the recipe.

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:52.480
Or sometimes I'll be
at my brother's house,

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:54.616
and he makes a dish
that's not light.

00:21:54.616 --> 00:21:56.740
And they're like can you
give us the recipe anyway?

00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:59.062
So I'm like I don't know
where I'm going to do that.

00:21:59.062 --> 00:22:00.770
JAMES MULCAHY: So you
do all this cooking

00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:01.644
in your home kitchen.

00:22:01.644 --> 00:22:02.724
GINA HOMOLKA: I do.

00:22:02.724 --> 00:22:04.390
JAMES MULCAHY: And
is it a nice kitchen?

00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:04.610
GINA HOMOLKA: No.

00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:05.470
JAMES MULCAHY: I have
my little apartment

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:06.080
kitchen's like this big.

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:08.079
GINA HOMOLKA: There's
nothing nice about it, no.

00:22:08.079 --> 00:22:09.800
I never take pictures
of my kitchen.

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:12.482
I never redid the kitchen
from when I first moved in,

00:22:12.482 --> 00:22:13.565
and it was always my goal.

00:22:13.565 --> 00:22:15.120
And then when I
started blogging,

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:17.130
I couldn't, because then
I'd have no kitchen.

00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:20.112
So we actually
bought a new house

00:22:20.112 --> 00:22:22.320
and we're going to make a
nice kitchen in that house.

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:24.450
But right now, no, the
kitchen's not pretty.

00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:25.180
JAMES MULCAHY: I
betcha you end up

00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:25.735
missing the not pretty kitchen.

00:22:25.735 --> 00:22:27.331
GINA HOMOLKA: The counters
are mauve, like ugh.

00:22:27.331 --> 00:22:28.744
There's nothing pretty about it.

00:22:28.744 --> 00:22:30.160
JAMES MULCAHY: [LAUGH] Mauve.

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:33.360
I haven't heard that word since
I was using crayons I think.

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:34.639
GINA HOMOLKA: It's not pretty.

00:22:34.639 --> 00:22:36.430
JAMES MULCAHY: Home
cooks, I'm sure there's

00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:38.306
some here listening along.

00:22:38.306 --> 00:22:39.930
What are the essential
things that they

00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:41.640
have to have in their
kitchen to do this?

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:44.487
Both ingredients and kind of
tools to make these things?

00:22:44.487 --> 00:22:46.070
GINA HOMOLKA: Well,
the ingredients, I

00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:50.210
feel like having
all your dried herbs

00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:52.382
and spices-- spices
and herbs are something

00:22:52.382 --> 00:22:54.840
like you're going to spend a
lot of money in the beginning,

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:56.590
but they're going to
last you a long time.

00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:58.090
So having that on hand.

00:22:58.090 --> 00:23:01.780
And then as far as
cooking appliances,

00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:04.810
really good nonstick
pans, a really good knife,

00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:07.980
a wooden cutting board.

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:10.440
Those are essentials that
you really need to start.

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:11.850
JAMES MULCAHY: Right,
the kind of very basics--

00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:12.195
GINA HOMOLKA: Really basics.

00:23:12.195 --> 00:23:14.278
JAMES MULCAHY: that maybe
people take for granted.

00:23:14.278 --> 00:23:17.060
GINA HOMOLKA: If you want to get
fancy, slow cooker, spiralizer.

00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:19.600
I love my spiralizer--
yeah-- to make Zoodles,

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.626
which are zucchini noodles.

00:23:22.626 --> 00:23:24.500
Yeah, I mean you could
have a ton of gadgets,

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:28.619
but to start with, you
don't really need a lot.

00:23:28.619 --> 00:23:31.160
JAMES MULCAHY: So I think a lot
of the success of the program

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.410
for you has been just eating
with your family, too.

00:23:33.410 --> 00:23:33.860
GINA HOMOLKA: Oh yeah.

00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:35.956
JAMES MULCAHY: And I think
that's time is what you need,

00:23:35.956 --> 00:23:35.988
right?

00:23:35.988 --> 00:23:36.821
GINA HOMOLKA: Right.

00:23:36.821 --> 00:23:37.710
Absolutely.

00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:40.574
I mean I try to always
make the recipes quick,

00:23:40.574 --> 00:23:42.740
because I don't really-- I
didn't have a lot of time

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:43.390
when I started.

00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:45.750
I would work
full-time in the city.

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:48.070
You know, rush
home, cook a meal,

00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:50.320
try to beat the light
because you have to shoot

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:51.960
your photos in natural light.

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:54.150
So I would tell my
family to hold on,

00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:55.400
I just have to take a picture.

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:58.045
I'd shoot my plate and
they would wait for me--

00:23:58.045 --> 00:24:00.150
they'd get cold food.

00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:02.719
And again, I lost
my train of thought.

00:24:02.719 --> 00:24:05.010
JAMES MULCAHY: No, just kind
of like being able to have

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:05.980
a family there to cook for--

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:06.520
GINA HOMOLKA: Oh yeah.

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:07.050
JAMES MULCAHY:
--just seems to be--

00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:07.570
GINA HOMOLKA: Right.

00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:08.570
I don't think I
would have started

00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:10.130
a blog if I didn't have that.

00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:12.830
I feel like they were my
inspiration why I started it.

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:13.913
JAMES MULCAHY: Yeah, yeah.

00:24:13.913 --> 00:24:16.400
And I think the family
dinner is a good way.

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:18.650
Because I think a lot
of us Googlers probably

00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:22.277
are a little bit more
on the go and crazed,

00:24:22.277 --> 00:24:23.110
like running around.

00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:23.410
GINA HOMOLKA: Right.

00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:24.740
JAMES MULCAHY: So for
the delivery types

00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:26.890
and don't have this time,
do you have any advice?

00:24:26.890 --> 00:24:27.920
GINA HOMOLKA: Yeah.

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:29.060
Get a slow cooker.

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:30.500
I mean like there's
nothing easier

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:32.500
than throwing in
ingredients in the morning,

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:34.995
going to work, and come
home and dinner's ready.

00:24:34.995 --> 00:24:37.140
The slow cooker is
your best friend.

00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:40.270
Also, on the days
off, you could make

00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:43.330
two, three batches of different
soups and then freeze them.

00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:46.690
Put them in portion controlled,
freezer-friendly containers

00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:47.860
and label them.

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:50.850
And then you have your
own freezer-friendly meals

00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:55.490
for lunch, if you want to reheat
them, or for another dinner.

00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:58.010
So that's a really great
way to do it and save time--

00:24:58.010 --> 00:24:58.490
JAMES MULCAHY: Cook in batches.

00:24:58.490 --> 00:24:58.630
GINA HOMOLKA: when you're busy.

00:24:58.630 --> 00:24:58.920
Yeah.

00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:00.640
JAMES MULCAHY: Yeah,
that's good advice.

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:03.600
And working out, I know you said
that was on your list of three

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:04.320
essential things.

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:05.570
What do you do?

00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:10.160
GINA HOMOLKA: I like to do
strength training and cardio.

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:11.110
Nothing fancy.

00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:15.680
I do treadmill, elliptical,
and just weights.

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:18.196
JAMES MULCAHY: So you don't
need to go to P90X or CrossFit

00:25:18.196 --> 00:25:19.610
or all that pretty stuff.

00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:20.470
GINA HOMOLKA: No, I
don't do any of that.

00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:20.990
No.

00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:21.830
I'm not that strong.

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:22.705
JAMES MULCAHY: Right.

00:25:22.705 --> 00:25:24.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:25.980
But it is an essential part of--

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:28.063
GINA HOMOLKA: I feel like
it's good for your soul,

00:25:28.063 --> 00:25:31.390
but it also, there's
a balance and I

00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:33.080
feel better when I
work out, but I also

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:37.690
feel like it tones me and you
look better by working out.

00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:38.274
So absolutely.

00:25:38.274 --> 00:25:39.940
JAMES MULCAHY: That's
something I always

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:42.250
feel about when people
talk about diet, people say

00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:42.750
oh, a diet.

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:44.670
I want to lose this
much weight by this day.

00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:47.220
But to really make it successful
it's more of a lifestyle,

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:47.560
right?

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:47.720
GINA HOMOLKA: Absolutely.

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:49.340
JAMES MULCAHY: Make it like
a lifelong commitment that--

00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:49.850
GINA HOMOLKA: Absolutely.

00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:51.266
JAMES MULCAHY:
--you have to make.

00:25:51.266 --> 00:25:53.840
GINA HOMOLKA: You don't put
on the weight in two months.

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:56.370
You can't expect to
lose it in two months.

00:25:56.370 --> 00:25:59.030
I feel like you have to just
make small changes that you

00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:00.730
can stick with long term.

00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:05.260
I don't believe in
eliminating entire food groups

00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:06.650
from your diet to lose weight.

00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:10.140
Like I did no carbs
before I started blogging

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:12.390
and I was really unsuccessful
at it, because I craved

00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:13.730
pasta and I craved bread.

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:15.754
And I would always lose
weight, but then I'd

00:26:15.754 --> 00:26:18.420
gain it all right back because I
would start eating pasta again.

00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:21.209
So I think just having
everything in moderation.

00:26:21.209 --> 00:26:22.750
JAMES MULCAHY: Yeah,
even moderation.

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:23.500
GINA HOMOLKA: Yes.

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:24.320
Moderation is key.

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:25.570
JAMES MULCAHY: Well, it's
funny you mentioned no carbs.

00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:27.903
So I want to ask you about a
few of the diet crazes that

00:26:27.903 --> 00:26:29.260
are out there these days.

00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:31.120
So you said no carbs.

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:32.330
You just want pasta too much.

00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:33.327
GINA HOMOLKA: Right.

00:26:33.327 --> 00:26:34.910
JAMES MULCAHY: Who
doesn't like carbs.

00:26:34.910 --> 00:26:36.826
GINA HOMOLKA: I'll do
low carb, but I'll still

00:26:36.826 --> 00:26:37.880
have my pasta days.

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:38.610
So yeah.

00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:40.260
JAMES MULCAHY: Right, so you're
able to cheat a little bit.

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:41.801
GINA HOMOLKA: I just
kind of balance.

00:26:41.801 --> 00:26:44.590
If I have a low carb day,
I'll have a pasta for dinner

00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:45.590
that night.

00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:46.320
JAMES MULCAHY: All
right, what about

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.760
have you heard about this bone
broth that people are doing?

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:48.920
GINA HOMOLKA: No.

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:50.545
JAMES MULCAHY: I just
heard about this.

00:26:50.545 --> 00:26:52.917
It's these chefs in New York
are now basically making

00:26:52.917 --> 00:26:55.375
kind of pasta broth that they
would usually make soup with.

00:26:55.375 --> 00:26:58.220
But they're just serving
the broth in a coffee cup,

00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:00.410
and apparently this is
supposed to help you

00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:02.706
be nourished and lose weight.

00:27:02.706 --> 00:27:04.970
GINA HOMOLKA: I don't know.

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:07.067
There's no solid foods involved.

00:27:07.067 --> 00:27:08.150
JAMES MULCAHY: I guess so.

00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:08.840
GINA HOMOLKA: A liquid diet.

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:10.240
I don't think I can do that.

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:11.130
FEMALE SPEAKER: It's like detox.

00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:12.140
JAMES MULCAHY: Yeah,
you get detoxed.

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:13.200
GINA HOMOLKA: Is it
like a long-term thing?

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.440
JAMES MULCAHY: You could
like shave tumeric over it.

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:16.773
No, people are just replacing
their morning or afternoon

00:27:16.773 --> 00:27:17.820
coffee with bone broth.

00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:18.260
GINA HOMOLKA: OK.

00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:19.260
It's kind of like having a soup.

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:20.250
JAMES MULCAHY: It's very trendy.

00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:21.254
Zagat.com, everyone.

00:27:21.254 --> 00:27:22.670
FEMALE SPEAKER:
It's like juicing.

00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:23.010
GINA HOMOLKA: OK.

00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:24.218
JAMES MULCAHY: Well, jucing--

00:27:24.218 --> 00:27:28.025
GINA HOMOLKA: It's like a
savory type of juice, right?

00:27:28.025 --> 00:27:28.970
Yeah.

00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:29.620
Bone juice.

00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:30.270
JAMES MULCAHY:
Hot, savory juice.

00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:32.811
FEMALE SPEAKER: There may be a
cookbook coming December 2015,

00:27:32.811 --> 00:27:33.532
all about--

00:27:33.532 --> 00:27:35.490
JAMES MULCAHY: See, they
know about bone broth.

00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:36.490
GINA HOMOLKA: They know.

00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:37.280
See, they know.

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:39.660
JAMES MULCAHY: So then bone
broth maybe it's very new.

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:40.900
What about juice cleanse?

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:42.950
Every time I always
have a friend who's

00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:44.867
trying to start to lose
weight, juice cleanse.

00:27:44.867 --> 00:27:46.616
They're like oh, I'm
on seven day cleanse.

00:27:46.616 --> 00:27:47.750
I'm like seven days?

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:48.796
Are you mad?

00:27:48.796 --> 00:27:50.670
GINA HOMOLKA: I personally
don't do cleanses.

00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:53.700
I get stomach aches when
I drink too much juice,

00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:55.780
so it doesn't work for me.

00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:58.040
I don't do cleanses.

00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:02.430
If I feel like I put on weight,
I'll just get back on track

00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:05.907
and do portion control and go
to the gym and lose it again.

00:28:05.907 --> 00:28:07.990
JAMES MULCAHY: So you have
your moments when you--

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:08.781
GINA HOMOLKA: I do.

00:28:08.781 --> 00:28:11.030
I mean I had two children.

00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:13.082
You have your moments.

00:28:13.082 --> 00:28:16.260
You go on vacation, you
eat too much that week.

00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:17.470
I always have those moments.

00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:22.610
It's why I started the blog.

00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:25.362
As you get older, your
metabolism slows down.

00:28:25.362 --> 00:28:27.070
So yes, absolutely,
I have those moments.

00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:28.310
JAMES MULCAHY: So
don't get discouraged

00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:29.510
if you fall off a little bit.

00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:30.030
GINA HOMOLKA: Oh no.

00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:31.140
I mean I don't beat myself up.

00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:33.515
I just say, all right, today
I'm starting all over again.

00:28:33.515 --> 00:28:34.270
Today's day one.

00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:36.621
I'm not going to
think about yesterday.

00:28:36.621 --> 00:28:37.370
JAMES MULCAHY: OK.

00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:38.770
Butter coffee.

00:28:38.770 --> 00:28:39.860
Have you heard of this?

00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:40.220
GINA HOMOLKA: No.

00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:42.510
JAMES MULCAHY: Have you
guys heard of butter coffee?

00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:43.690
I've personally think it's nuts.

00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:44.170
GINA HOMOLKA: What is it?

00:28:44.170 --> 00:28:46.750
JAMES MULCAHY: It's basically
coffee with butter in it.

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:48.333
You drink it in the
morning and you're

00:28:48.333 --> 00:28:50.654
supposed to just have that
and then you go to dinner.

00:28:50.654 --> 00:28:52.820
But it gets you through the
day because it gives you

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:55.430
this illusion of fullness.

00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:56.230
GINA HOMOLKA: Wow.

00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:59.780
I don't think that would
be good for my cholesterol.

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:02.810
JAMES MULCAHY:
[LAUGH] I guess not.

00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:04.870
It's kind of a crash
diet thing right now.

00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:07.382
You Google it, you'll
find it's pretty nuts.

00:29:07.382 --> 00:29:08.090
GINA HOMOLKA: OK.

00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:09.048
Yeah, I'm not familiar.

00:29:09.048 --> 00:29:10.690
Is there a book
coming out? [LAUGH]

00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:11.440
JAMES MULCAHY: No.

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:11.840
Probably--

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:13.166
FEMALE SPEAKER: It's
called "Bulletproof."

00:29:13.166 --> 00:29:14.150
JAMES MULCAHY: "Bulletproof."

00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:15.140
GINA HOMOLKA: "Bulletproof."

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:15.560
JAMES MULCAHY: Yeah.

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:17.980
They serve it-- I've actually
seen it served at the gym,

00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:20.772
like they have a butter coffee
at their little juice bar.

00:29:20.772 --> 00:29:21.980
And like this can't be right.

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:22.896
GINA HOMOLKA: Strange.

00:29:22.896 --> 00:29:24.511
JAMES MULCAHY: Like it's weird.

00:29:24.511 --> 00:29:26.010
Let's see, how are
we doing on time?

00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:28.650
I think we're-- well, no,
we're doing pretty well.

00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:29.750
So what's next for you?

00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:32.960
Is it you've done the
blog, you've done the book.

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:33.730
TV?

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:34.635
Are you going to be
the next Rachel Ray?

00:29:34.635 --> 00:29:35.310
GINA HOMOLKA: I don't know.

00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:37.600
JAMES MULCAHY: Are you
going to do some web series?

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:38.790
Where do you see this going?

00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:41.170
GINA HOMOLKA: You know
I never really saw--

00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:42.980
like seven years
ago I didn't know

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:46.960
that I was going to have a book
deal or make this a career.

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:49.300
So you just don't
know the future.

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:50.960
Like I can't even
predict what's going

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:52.940
to happen seven years from now.

00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:57.780
But right now there's nothing
in the works for TV or video.

00:29:57.780 --> 00:29:59.400
Perhaps when I
have my new kitchen

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:03.220
I want to try to start doing
some more video in my kitchen.

00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:04.453
And maybe a second book.

00:30:04.453 --> 00:30:05.203
JAMES MULCAHY: Oh.

00:30:05.203 --> 00:30:06.085
FEMALE SPEAKER: Stay tuned.

00:30:06.085 --> 00:30:07.168
JAMES MULCAHY: Stay tuned.

00:30:07.168 --> 00:30:08.850
That's a good little
foreshadowing.

00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:10.900
Do you think the blog
is going to still--

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:13.642
the blog as an idea, is it still
going to have relevance in four

00:30:13.642 --> 00:30:15.850
or five years, or do you
think people are moving more

00:30:15.850 --> 00:30:18.552
onto social media?

00:30:18.552 --> 00:30:20.510
GINA HOMOLKA: Yeah, I'm
not-- it's hard to say.

00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:24.110
I feel like social media works
hand in hand with the blog.

00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:26.440
So I'm not sure.

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:28.060
I mean things are
always changing,

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:29.490
so it's hard to predict.

00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:30.370
JAMES MULCAHY: People
are always going

00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:32.244
to want to learn how to
lose weight and learn

00:30:32.244 --> 00:30:34.010
how to cook better
for themselves

00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:34.260
and change their lifestyles.

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:34.980
GINA HOMOLKA:
Right, right, right.

00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:36.000
Absolutely.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.650
I hope it doesn't go away
because I actually really enjoy

00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:38.080
doing it.

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:39.040
JAMES MULCAHY: Yeah, it's
an evergreen business.

00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:40.700
I mean like we were saying
it's a lifelong commitment.

00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:41.070
GINA HOMOLKA: Right, it is.

00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:41.720
JAMES MULCAHY: So
you're always going

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:43.220
to need that next new recipe.

00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:44.470
GINA HOMOLKA: Yeah, exactly.

00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:46.920
JAMES MULCAHY: And
then so book, blog.

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:47.440
What else?

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:51.840
I mean do you see yourself
ever stopping doing this?

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:53.180
GINA HOMOLKA: No, I don't.

00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:53.730
I know.

00:30:53.730 --> 00:30:55.438
People talk about
well, one day maybe you

00:30:55.438 --> 00:30:57.969
could sell Skinnytaste
and you could, you know.

00:30:57.969 --> 00:31:00.010
And I'm like no, I don't
want to stop doing this.

00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:00.830
I love doing this.

00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:02.620
So I can't see that right now.

00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:04.910
I mean maybe one day
my daughter will--

00:31:04.910 --> 00:31:06.160
I'll pass it onto my daughter.

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:06.820
Who knows?

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:07.320
Yeah.

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:08.410
But I love doing this.

00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:10.647
I don't have
intentions on stopping.

00:31:10.647 --> 00:31:11.480
JAMES MULCAHY: Yeah.

00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:12.930
I mean here we are
on the Google stage.

00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:13.270
GINA HOMOLKA: Exactly.

00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:14.570
JAMES MULCAHY: That means
things are going pretty well.

00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:15.950
GINA HOMOLKA: I would not
have gotten this opportunity

00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:17.310
if I was still a retoucher.

00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:21.202
[LAUGH] I've had amazing
opportunities with this blog

00:31:21.202 --> 00:31:22.660
that I could have
never dreamed of.

00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:24.160
JAMES MULCAHY: Maybe with
Skinnytaste line of food

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:24.659
one day?

00:31:24.659 --> 00:31:26.820
GINA HOMOLKA: You
know, you never know.

00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:29.850
Something like that could
be something-- selling

00:31:29.850 --> 00:31:34.150
something, frozen dishes
that are mine would be fun.

00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:36.280
JAMES MULCAHY: Yeah, I
think the frozen dishes

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:38.699
you see probably these
days are-- the recipes are

00:31:38.699 --> 00:31:39.990
a little boring still, I think.

00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:40.040
GINA HOMOLKA: Yeah.

00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:41.220
JAMES MULCAHY: It's
a little cardboardy

00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:41.900
like you were saying.

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:42.733
GINA HOMOLKA: Right.

00:31:42.733 --> 00:31:45.690
I mean I already know what
recipes people like on my site.

00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:47.840
And if perhaps they
don't want to cook it,

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:50.880
maybe I could offer it
frozen in the frozen section.

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:53.050
So if anyone's
listening-- [LAUGH]

00:31:53.050 --> 00:31:55.550
JAMES MULCAHY: Now that you've
kind of developed a following

00:31:55.550 --> 00:31:56.860
and you have this
book, do you get

00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:59.109
to meet these people in
person that are your followers

00:31:59.109 --> 00:32:00.760
and have really been
impacted by this?

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:01.790
GINA HOMOLKA: Yeah.

00:32:01.790 --> 00:32:05.630
So now that the book came out,
I went on a few book signings

00:32:05.630 --> 00:32:08.120
and I was able to
meet face-to-face

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:10.610
a lot of people that follow me.

00:32:10.610 --> 00:32:12.880
And it was great
because a lot of them

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:15.420
brought pictures of their before
and after they lost weight,

00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:17.419
and they showed me what
they looked like before.

00:32:17.419 --> 00:32:20.530
And it's just so great to see
them and meet them in person,

00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:23.660
and how they're regular people
and they're so grateful.

00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:25.304
So it's been such
a great experience.

00:32:25.304 --> 00:32:26.720
JAMES MULCAHY:
That's a good segue

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:28.928
to just mention that you're
going to be signing books

00:32:28.928 --> 00:32:30.200
in the back after the talk.

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:33.060
So if anyone wants their books
to be signed, you can go say hi

00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:34.350
when we're done here.

00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:34.830
GINA HOMOLKA: Perfect.

00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:37.150
JAMES MULCAHY: I'm just curious
to say the other craze I

00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:38.140
was going to ask
you about, I think

00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:39.810
there's a lot of debate
around "The Biggest Loser"

00:32:39.810 --> 00:32:40.910
and that sort of thing.

00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:43.340
These kind of binge
and purge shows.

00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:45.129
Do you have any take on that?

00:32:45.129 --> 00:32:47.420
GINA HOMOLKA: I don't really
watch "The Biggest Loser."

00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:52.210
So no, I don't really.

00:32:52.210 --> 00:32:54.310
I mean I know it
works for people.

00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:55.990
It's pretty intense.

00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:58.889
So I don't know.

00:32:58.889 --> 00:32:59.930
If it's working for them.

00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:00.370
JAMES MULCAHY: Yeah.

00:33:00.370 --> 00:33:01.430
Stick to the butter coffee.

00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:02.000
GINA HOMOLKA: Yeah.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.880
JAMES MULCAHY: That's
probably a better [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:04.930
GINA HOMOLKA: Exactly.

00:33:04.930 --> 00:33:05.930
JAMES MULCAHY: Cool.

00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:07.900
I think we're winding
down, and we're

00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:10.370
going to leave some time
for questions if anyone has

00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:13.000
Q&amp;A in the next few minutes.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.060
There's a few
microphones on each side,

00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:19.696
if anyone wants
to chat with Gina.

00:33:19.696 --> 00:33:21.070
Someone's got to
have a question.

00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:23.190
Here we go.

00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:24.570
AUDIENCE: Hi, Gina.

00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:25.330
My name is Andrea.

00:33:25.330 --> 00:33:26.070
Nice to meet you.

00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:26.580
GINA HOMOLKA: Nice to meet you.

00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:27.250
AUDIENCE: I love your cookbook.

00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:29.630
I make your Mediterranean
quinoa salad once a week.

00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:30.546
GINA HOMOLKA: Awesome.

00:33:30.546 --> 00:33:32.400
AUDIENCE: So yeah,
it never gets old.

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:34.700
Just had a question for
you about sponsored posts.

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:36.575
I know that you don't
do them too frequently,

00:33:36.575 --> 00:33:39.060
but I'm curious if there's
any one product in particular

00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:40.480
of all the ones you've worked
with that you would really

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:42.860
recommend getting for
someone who's super busy

00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:44.059
and doesn't have much time.

00:33:44.059 --> 00:33:46.350
GINA HOMOLKA: Yeah, I don't
do a lot of sponsored posts

00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:49.304
because I just get a lot
of backlash when I do.

00:33:49.304 --> 00:33:51.220
For some reason people
get really angry at me,

00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:54.745
and they tell me in the
comments I can't believe

00:33:54.745 --> 00:33:55.954
you got paid for this recipe.

00:33:55.954 --> 00:33:57.828
I don't know why they
get so mad because it's

00:33:57.828 --> 00:33:58.846
free-- the blog is free.

00:33:58.846 --> 00:33:59.470
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:00.261
GINA HOMOLKA: Yeah.

00:34:00.261 --> 00:34:04.810
But I also will only really
use a brand that I really love.

00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:07.210
So I'm working with
Harry and David.

00:34:07.210 --> 00:34:08.380
They have amazing pears.

00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:10.280
It's easy.

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:13.639
I did-- for the Potato
Board, which it's potatoes,

00:34:13.639 --> 00:34:14.980
so you can't go wrong with that.

00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:22.120
I was working with
Almond Breeze.

00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:25.150
As far as-- I'm trying
to think who else.

00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:27.380
Oh, I work with DeLallo pasta.

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:28.679
DeLallo is amazing.

00:34:28.679 --> 00:34:31.685
They have the best
tasting whole wheat pasta.

00:34:31.685 --> 00:34:33.310
So if you could get
your hands on that.

00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:35.190
We hate whole wheat
pasta at my house.

00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:37.451
So when I first tried
it, my husband's

00:34:37.451 --> 00:34:38.659
like this is not whole wheat.

00:34:38.659 --> 00:34:39.389
And I was like it is.

00:34:39.389 --> 00:34:40.190
He's like they're lying.

00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:40.820
I'm like they're not.

00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:41.980
Look, the ingredients
say whole wheat.

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:42.896
Like it's whole wheat.

00:34:42.896 --> 00:34:46.530
So I would say DeLallo's
whole wheat pasta's amazing.

00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:48.587
And I'm starting to
see it everywhere.

00:34:48.587 --> 00:34:49.420
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:50.211
GINA HOMOLKA: Sure.

00:34:52.513 --> 00:34:54.429
JAMES MULCAHY: Let's
see, any other questions?

00:34:54.429 --> 00:34:57.200
I think it's interesting you
mentioned quinoa, these very

00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:59.466
trendy ingredients these days.

00:34:59.466 --> 00:35:01.340
Are there a few of those
that you would like,

00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:02.840
or fans of like the quinoa.

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:04.660
I see grain bowls
are becoming a thing.

00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:04.750
Have you seen that?

00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:05.708
GINA HOMOLKA: They are.

00:35:05.708 --> 00:35:06.890
I like all those bowls.

00:35:06.890 --> 00:35:08.760
Yeah, quinoa used to be fancy.

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:10.930
I feel like now
it's so mainstream.

00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:13.596
Farro is one of those
things that you can't always

00:35:13.596 --> 00:35:14.595
find in the supermarket.

00:35:14.595 --> 00:35:18.390
So I feel like a lot of things
that aren't easy to buy,

00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:20.550
I guess are fancy.

00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:22.204
Chia-- I love using Chia.

00:35:22.204 --> 00:35:22.745
Chia pudding.

00:35:22.745 --> 00:35:23.150
JAMES MULCAHY: Chia.

00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:24.774
OK, I don't know if
I've ever had chia.

00:35:24.774 --> 00:35:27.100
GINA HOMOLKA: Yeah, it
expands when it's in liquid.

00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:29.640
So if you leave
it overnight, like

00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:31.450
I have a vanilla chia pudding.

00:35:31.450 --> 00:35:32.140
It's so good.

00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:33.260
Like it has this
strange texture,

00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:34.430
so it's not for everybody.

00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:37.020
But it gets a little
gelatinous, but it fills you up

00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:38.630
and it has lots of omegas.

00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:40.380
JAMES MULCAHY: Do you
have any predictions

00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:43.200
as to what the next kind of
big ingredient's going to be?

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:43.540
GINA HOMOLKA: I don't.

00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:44.470
JAMES MULCAHY: Other
than bone broth?

00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:46.636
GINA HOMOLKA: I mean Brussels
sprouts are really big

00:35:46.636 --> 00:35:49.569
right now, so maybe
more Brussels sprouts.

00:35:49.569 --> 00:35:51.110
JAMES MULCAHY: More
Brussels sprouts.

00:35:51.110 --> 00:35:52.970
Isn't it amazing, I was
a kid and I hated them.

00:35:52.970 --> 00:35:53.420
GINA HOMOLKA: I know.

00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:54.350
JAMES MULCAHY: And everyone
just loves them now.

00:35:54.350 --> 00:35:55.650
GINA HOMOLKA: Everybody
was cooking them wrong.

00:35:55.650 --> 00:35:56.483
JAMES MULCAHY: Yeah.

00:35:56.483 --> 00:35:57.275
GINA HOMOLKA: Yeah.

00:35:57.275 --> 00:35:59.107
JAMES MULCAHY: Yup, we
have a question here.

00:35:59.107 --> 00:36:01.080
AUDIENCE: With regards
to the pasta dishes,

00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:03.890
have you tried swapping
out for quinoa pasta,

00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:06.360
because we seem to actually
really love that in our house.

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:07.776
GINA HOMOLKA: I
love quinoa pasta.

00:36:07.776 --> 00:36:10.850
Yeah, I think it was
Ancient Grains I think

00:36:10.850 --> 00:36:12.390
was the brand that I tried.

00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:15.920
Because my aunt is
now gluten-free,

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:20.580
so I had to start trying
gluten-free brands.

00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:22.670
So experimenting
I've learned which

00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:23.990
ones are better than others.

00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:25.430
But the quinoa
pasta's wonderful.

00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:26.310
Tastes great.

00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:26.810
Whole grain.

00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:29.309
AUDIENCE: So your recipes then
you could probably swap out--

00:36:29.309 --> 00:36:30.520
GINA HOMOLKA: Oh, absolutely.

00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:31.240
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:33.520
GINA HOMOLKA: Absolutely.

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:36.145
JAMES MULCAHY: How do you modify
your recipes for gluten-free--

00:36:36.145 --> 00:36:37.360
your gluten-free friends?

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:40.430
GINA HOMOLKA: So anything
that can be modified, I always

00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:41.540
tell people how.

00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:44.610
So if it's made
with soy sauce I'll

00:36:44.610 --> 00:36:47.110
tell them to use
gluten-free Tamari.

00:36:47.110 --> 00:36:49.120
If it's flower I'll
tell them to use

00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:51.480
all-purpose gluten-free
flour in place, because I

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:54.210
have tested them and they work.

00:36:54.210 --> 00:36:56.470
So I usually in every
recipe, even in the book,

00:36:56.470 --> 00:36:59.001
I always talk about how to
make something gluten-free.

00:36:59.001 --> 00:37:00.584
JAMES MULCAHY: Do
you have a question?

00:37:00.584 --> 00:37:01.480
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:04.770
So I just bought a zucchini
spiralizer the other week

00:37:04.770 --> 00:37:05.990
and I love it.

00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:07.870
But how do you
make the zucchini--

00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:09.820
how do you get all
the water out of it?

00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:11.580
Because I found that
after sauteing it,

00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:13.690
it gets a little watery.

00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:15.100
How do you work that?

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:18.010
GINA HOMOLKA: When I make
the spiralized zucchini,

00:37:18.010 --> 00:37:21.060
I just cook it for about
a minute and a half.

00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:23.900
After that I feel like
it starts getting watery.

00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:25.660
So I will cook it for
a minute and a half,

00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:28.110
remove it from the pot because
it'll still keep cooking,

00:37:28.110 --> 00:37:29.270
and serve it right away.

00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:32.050
So it's still a little
al dente kind of,

00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:35.190
and it eliminates
that sogginess.

00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:40.330
Also, I do some Asian dishes
that are cooked in a sauce.

00:37:40.330 --> 00:37:46.220
So I'll make my
sauce not as thick,

00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:49.550
like knowing that the zucchini's
going to add water to it.

00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:53.300
So I'll cook it in the
sauce the last two minutes,

00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:56.769
and it's going to kind of
bring everything together.

00:37:56.769 --> 00:37:58.060
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] too long.

00:37:58.060 --> 00:37:58.851
GINA HOMOLKA: Yeah.

00:37:58.851 --> 00:37:59.351
I know.

00:37:59.351 --> 00:38:01.392
That's usually what happens
when you first start.

00:38:01.392 --> 00:38:03.060
Also using a thicker
setting because it

00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:04.309
comes with different settings.

00:38:04.309 --> 00:38:04.830
It's better.

00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:07.230
The thicker setting is better
because it's not as thin

00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:09.467
so it doesn't melt away.

00:38:09.467 --> 00:38:10.300
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:11.364
GINA HOMOLKA: Yeah, sure.

00:38:11.364 --> 00:38:13.780
JAMES MULCAHY: Are there any
food that you just won't eat?

00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:17.730
GINA HOMOLKA: I won't
eat kidneys or liver.

00:38:17.730 --> 00:38:21.070
And I say that because
I grew up with my mom

00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:23.760
cooking that at times.

00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:25.180
And I don't like Lima beans.

00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:26.430
JAMES MULCAHY: Lima beans, OK.

00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:28.000
Maybe Lima bean's going
to be the next Brussels

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:28.950
sprout though--

00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:29.280
GINA HOMOLKA: Maybe.

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:29.740
JAMES MULCAHY: --and
make a comeback.

00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:31.281
GINA HOMOLKA: I'll
have to figure out

00:38:31.281 --> 00:38:34.516
a way, some kind of Lima
bean hummus or something.

00:38:34.516 --> 00:38:35.182
That might work.

00:38:35.182 --> 00:38:35.550
JAMES MULCAHY: Not too bad.

00:38:35.550 --> 00:38:36.840
GINA HOMOLKA: Yeah.

00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:38.756
JAMES MULCAHY: Let's
see, any other questions?

00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:43.060
AUDIENCE: I have one, but
should I just yell out loud?

00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:43.620
JAMES MULCAHY: You can yell.

00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:44.690
We can hear you.

00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:45.320
I'll repeat it.

00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:47.224
AUDIENCE: I can't
get cauliflower crust

00:38:47.224 --> 00:38:50.002
right for pizza, which is
one of my favorite dishes.

00:38:50.002 --> 00:38:50.960
I try to lighten it up.

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:52.577
It's just a soggy mess.

00:38:52.577 --> 00:38:53.830
So any tips?

00:38:53.830 --> 00:38:56.490
GINA HOMOLKA: Yeah, I don't
have a cauliflower crust

00:38:56.490 --> 00:38:59.630
pizza on my site,
because I remember

00:38:59.630 --> 00:39:00.860
having the same issues.

00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:05.110
Like if it requires so much
cheese that it's low carb,

00:39:05.110 --> 00:39:06.509
but it's full of fat.

00:39:06.509 --> 00:39:08.050
There's so much
cheese, you're almost

00:39:08.050 --> 00:39:10.554
having like a cheese crust.

00:39:10.554 --> 00:39:11.970
AUDIENCE: Cheese
on top of cheese.

00:39:11.970 --> 00:39:12.990
GINA HOMOLKA: Exactly.

00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:16.500
So that's why I never used it
because it was like when I did

00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:18.590
the calories it was still high.

00:39:18.590 --> 00:39:20.000
It was just not carbs.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:20.500
Yeah.

00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:22.430
I felt like it was
a lot of cheese.

00:39:22.430 --> 00:39:24.830
I actually tried it with
spaghetti squash and it worked.

00:39:24.830 --> 00:39:29.040
It was good with spaghetti
squash instead of cauliflower.

00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:31.070
And maybe I have to keep
experimenting with that

00:39:31.070 --> 00:39:33.057
and see if I could
perfect that one.

00:39:33.057 --> 00:39:34.890
JAMES MULCAHY: Something
we notice at Zagat,

00:39:34.890 --> 00:39:38.220
actually, is cauliflower's the
trendy ingredient of the moment

00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:38.720
right now.

00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:39.010
GINA HOMOLKA: Great.

00:39:39.010 --> 00:39:40.385
JAMES MULCAHY:
And a lot of chefs

00:39:40.385 --> 00:39:43.030
are substituting it for meat
and making steaks and using it

00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:43.990
as a vessel for flavor.

00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:45.034
Are you cauliflower fans?

00:39:45.034 --> 00:39:45.950
GINA HOMOLKA: Oh yeah.

00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:49.180
I have Buffalo cauliflower
that is instead of chicken,

00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:50.050
it's cauliflower.

00:39:50.050 --> 00:39:52.230
It's super popular
and people love it.

00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:55.440
It's amazing how
popular cauliflower is.

00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:59.170
I make a cauliflower rice, like
a fried rice instead of rice.

00:39:59.170 --> 00:40:01.590
I use cauliflower in
place of everything.

00:40:01.590 --> 00:40:02.747
I love cauliflower.

00:40:02.747 --> 00:40:03.580
My husband hates it.

00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:06.930
So when he likes it, I
know I did a good job.

00:40:06.930 --> 00:40:08.680
JAMES MULCAHY: It's
very versatile, right.

00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:09.040
GINA HOMOLKA: I love it.

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:09.550
JAMES MULCAHY: It
can do everything.

00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:11.090
GINA HOMOLKA: Yeah.

00:40:11.090 --> 00:40:14.210
I have cauliflower steaks,
and in the target version

00:40:14.210 --> 00:40:16.230
of the cookbook they have
an exclusive version.

00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:18.040
JAMES MULCAHY: Oh, cool.

00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:19.162
GINA HOMOLKA: So yeah.

00:40:19.162 --> 00:40:19.995
JAMES MULCAHY: Cool.

00:40:19.995 --> 00:40:20.622
What else?

00:40:20.622 --> 00:40:21.580
We got one in the back?

00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:24.160
AUDIENCE: What is
your favorite recipe?

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:25.650
GINA HOMOLKA: In the book or?

00:40:25.650 --> 00:40:27.044
AUDIENCE: Or on the blog.

00:40:27.044 --> 00:40:29.335
GINA HOMOLKA: That's such a
hard question all the time.

00:40:29.335 --> 00:40:32.820
It depends on the
day of the week.

00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:35.090
My kids love the Picadillo.

00:40:35.090 --> 00:40:40.470
I mean I make that
probably every two weeks.

00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:45.260
I love in the book
the Zucchini Lasagna.

00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:47.290
It tastes just like
lasagna, but it

00:40:47.290 --> 00:40:48.940
has zucchini instead of pasta.

00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:50.360
It's really good.

00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:52.740
That would probably be-- or
the Buttermilk Fried Chicken.

00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:55.817
I love fried chicken, so easy.

00:40:55.817 --> 00:40:57.650
JAMES MULCAHY: How do
you make that healthy?

00:40:57.650 --> 00:40:58.720
GINA HOMOLKA: I remove the skin.

00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:00.136
I soak it overnight
in buttermilk,

00:41:00.136 --> 00:41:04.310
so it has all the flavor like
with herbs and lemon juice.

00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:07.550
And then I put a
crispy crust on top,

00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:09.425
and then bake it at a
really high temperature

00:41:09.425 --> 00:41:11.380
and it still tastes
like fried chicken.

00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:12.360
JAMES MULCAHY: That's what
we had upstairs today, right?

00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:13.740
GINA HOMOLKA: Yeah.

00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:15.930
It has all the great flavor,
just without the skin

00:41:15.930 --> 00:41:17.250
and without the frying.

00:41:17.250 --> 00:41:18.580
And without the mess.

00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:20.652
Frying is messy,
so baking's easy.

00:41:20.652 --> 00:41:22.110
JAMES MULCAHY: I
love those recipes

00:41:22.110 --> 00:41:23.850
that have the quotes around
it, like "fried" chicken.

00:41:23.850 --> 00:41:25.036
So that means good for me.

00:41:25.036 --> 00:41:25.073
GINA HOMOLKA: Right.

00:41:25.073 --> 00:41:25.430
I have lots of those.

00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:26.350
JAMES MULCAHY: I can eat that.

00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:26.850
Yeah.

00:41:26.850 --> 00:41:29.238
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:29.238 --> 00:41:29.738
What else?

00:41:33.130 --> 00:41:35.360
No more questions?

00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:37.110
Quinoa.

00:41:37.110 --> 00:41:38.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:39.800
Celery?

00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:42.930
GINA HOMOLKA: Let's think
of a trendy ingredient

00:41:42.930 --> 00:41:46.070
that people aren't using.

00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:48.360
My zucchini noodles
are super popular.

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:49.550
The Zoodles I call them.

00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:49.960
JAMES MULCAHY: Zoodles.

00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:50.751
GINA HOMOLKA: Yeah.

00:41:50.751 --> 00:41:53.050
My husband names everything.

00:41:53.050 --> 00:41:55.680
When I do spaghetti squash,
he calls it Squashta.

00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:56.820
And I was like I love that.

00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:58.900
So he's just really
quick with it,

00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:01.540
so he comes up with
these one line names,

00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:03.370
and I'm like I'm using that.

00:42:03.370 --> 00:42:07.400
So yeah, Squashta,
spaghetti squash.

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:10.000
JAMES MULCAHY: So people could
come and see this on your blog.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:11.950
How often do you
publish these days?

00:42:11.950 --> 00:42:13.100
GINA HOMOLKA: I do
about three days a week.

00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:13.930
JAMES MULCAHY: Three
days a week, OK.

00:42:13.930 --> 00:42:14.340
GINA HOMOLKA: Sometimes four.

00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:15.660
JAMES MULCAHY: Cookbook
is out, but the blog

00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:16.885
is still up and running.

00:42:16.885 --> 00:42:17.676
GINA HOMOLKA: Yeah.

00:42:17.676 --> 00:42:18.180
Absolutely.

00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:18.740
Yeah.

00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:20.910
I never stopped, even when
I was doing the cookbook

00:42:20.910 --> 00:42:22.035
I kept posting new recipes.

00:42:22.035 --> 00:42:23.868
JAMES MULCAHY: Fingers
are going to fall off

00:42:23.868 --> 00:42:24.800
from all that typing.

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:26.950
I think familiar feeling
to all of us Googlers.

00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:28.580
GINA HOMOLKA: Well, yeah, yeah.

00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:30.420
I mean I don't
really write a lot.

00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:33.710
It's mostly photo, photo,
recipe, and just a small blurb

00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:36.437
about my experience making it.

00:42:36.437 --> 00:42:37.270
JAMES MULCAHY: Cool.

00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:38.890
I think I'm going to
leave a little extra time,

00:42:38.890 --> 00:42:40.473
and if no one has
any other questions.

00:42:40.473 --> 00:42:42.530
So you can all say hi
to Gina in the back

00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:44.090
and get your cookbook signed.

00:42:44.090 --> 00:42:46.785
And definitely check out
her blog, Skinnytaste.com

00:42:46.785 --> 00:42:48.084
and get some recipes.

00:42:48.084 --> 00:42:50.000
I'm going to go really
eat healthy after this.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:50.791
GINA HOMOLKA: Good.

00:42:50.791 --> 00:42:52.650
JAMES MULCAHY: I'm
not going to lie.

00:42:52.650 --> 00:42:53.630
I'm going to look for the
famous quotes around it.

00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:54.750
GINA HOMOLKA: Maybe I
inspired one person.

00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:55.666
JAMES MULCAHY: I know.

00:42:55.666 --> 00:42:57.550
Like mmm.

00:42:57.550 --> 00:42:58.050
Cool.

00:42:58.050 --> 00:42:58.560
Thank you so much, Gina--

00:42:58.560 --> 00:42:59.520
GINA HOMOLKA: Thank you
so mu for having me.

00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:00.280
JAMES MULCAHY: for
hanging out with us today.

00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:01.280
GINA HOMOLKA: Thank you.

00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:02.130
[APPLAUSE]
